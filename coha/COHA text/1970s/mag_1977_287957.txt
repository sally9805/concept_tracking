From hoi polloi to hoity-toity <P> Carter is not exactly a grand old English name . The first Carters were , of course , carters , medieval truck drivers . Yet despite the family 's hoi-polloi origins and plain-folks posture , Jimmy Carter 's family tree turns out to have some hoity-toity upper limbs . The President is related to , among others , Queen Elizabeth I , George Washington , three other previous Presidents and the first American millionaire . <P> Jimmy 's rich roots have been unearthed by Debrett 's , the famed English tracers of lineage . Pursuing genealogical research for another , undisclosed American Carter , Debrett 's has tracked Jimmy 's forebears back to 1361 and King 's Langley , a quaint Hertfordshire village that is now a commuter suburb , 18 miles north of London . The prospering yeoman family at one time owned Jefferies farm in nearby Chipperfield ( the Chip Carter connection ? ) , and the King 's Langley church has a brass plaque in memory of Ancestor John Carter , departed this world in 1588 . Another Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Dick Whittington fashion , became a prosperous wine merchant . As befitted a new gentleman , he applied for a coat of arms in 1612 ; Carter Lane , off Fleet Street , still bears his name . <P> Two of Vintner John 's armigeral sons emigrated to the American colonies aboard the good ship Safety in 1635 . Jimmy 's 11th generation ancestor Thomas became a well-to-do Virginia planter , while his elder brother John acquired an even richer swath of Old Dominion farm land . It was John 's son , Robert ( " King " ) Carter , who became the first American millionaire . According to Harold Brooks-Baker , Debrett 's managing director , hustling King Carter owned 300,000 acres , more than 1,000 slaves and perhaps the largest collection of books in the colonies - at a time , notes Brooks-Baker , when " wealth was measured by the number of fine volumes you had . " King was also a banker ; his three Virginia estates are still owned by Carters , the Fest of the FFV ( First Families of Virginia ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , and hence to Queen Elizabeth I , by intermarriage with the aristocratic Tookes and Newces of Hertfordshire and Virginia ; they are also related to the Harrisons , the family that produced Presidents William Henry and Benjamin Harrison , and to the presidential Madisons . Family connections aside , says Brooks-Baker , " over the past six centuries , many of President Carter 's ancestors have reached positions of immense importance . Some were very intelligent , but they did n't produce much with their brains . They were a little bit sleepy-like the President 's brother . " <P> The blue-blooding of Carter may come as a considerable surprise to the President 's family , which hitherto has traced its roots to a different and less-distinguished Virginia branch . ( On his visit to England in June , Chip Carter apparently visited the wrong ancestral village , Christchurch , which is about 100 miles southwest of King 's Langley . ) In any event , Carter 's onetime countrymen are delighted to find that the President of the U.S. is to the manor born , sort of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an aristocrat.
