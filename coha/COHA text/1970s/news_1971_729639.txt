txt Two Bronx men were arrested yesterday after they allegedly tried to bribe a captain and a sergeant of the Police Department 's inspections division to let an illegal gambling ring operate freely in the central part of the Bronx . The captain , John Rogan , said he was shocked at the attempt , " given Commissioner Murphy 's fight on corruption " in the department . " Bribery arrests have occurred as a matter of course for years , " he said , " but they have received little publicity , as opposed to the publicity when a cop takes a bribe . " The inspections division is headquartered in Manhattan . The two officers were in the Bronx on an undisclosed mission . Interviewed at the 48th Precinct station at 1925 Bathgate Avenue , the captain said : " This area has its share of police corruption , but to what extent I do n't know .

Dowd , also known as William Green , of 2050 Valentine Avenue . The police said Mr. Dowd had a long record of gambling arrests . Dressed in a brilliant yellow African-style dashiki shirt , Mr. Dowd was silent after he was booked at the station . Mr. Martin , dressed in a brown sports ensemble , appeared to mouth an obscenity . But the police said that both men had spoken freely as they made the bribe offers to the captain and to Sgt. Edward Burke while all four were seated in an unmarked police radio car yesterday morning . They said 10 minutes of the conversation had been recorded on tape and would be used as evidence . Mr. Dowd and Mr. Martin were charged with bribery of a public official , a felony that is punishable by seven years in prison .
