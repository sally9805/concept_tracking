night after the boys had gone to bed Thomas Hudson and Roger Davis sat up in the big room talking . It had been too rough to do much goggle-fishing and after supper the boys had gone off with Joseph to go snapper fishing . They had come back tired and happy and said good night and gone to bed . The men had heard them talking for a while and then they were asleep . Andrew was afraid of the dark and the other boys knew it but they never teased him about it . ' Why do you think he 's afraid of the dark ? ' Roger asked . ' I do n't know , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Were n't you ? ' ' I do n't think so . ' ' I was , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Is it supposed to mean any-thing ? ' ' I do n't know , ' Roger said . ' I was afraid of dying and that something would happen to my brother .

' ' What was it ? ' ' A canoe turned over with us . ' ' How old were you ? ' ' About twelve . ' ' Do n't talk about it if you do n't want to . ' ' I 'm not sure it did me a lot of good , ' Roger said . ' Did n't you know about it really ? ' ' Never . ' ' For a long time I thought everybody in the world knew about it . It 's strange when you are a boy . The water was too cold and he let go . But what it added up to was that I came back and he did n't . ' ' Poor bloody Roger . ' ' No , ' said Roger .

I do n't think my father ever forgave me although he tried to understand it . I 've wished it was me every day since . But that 's hardly a career . ' ' What was your brother 's name ? ' Dave : ' Hell . Was that why you would n't go goggle-fishing today ? ' ' I guess so . But I 'm going every other day . You never work those things out , though . ' ' You 're grown up enough not to talk that way . ' ' I tried to go down after him . But I could n't find him , ' Roger said . ' It was too deep and it was really cold .

I told you once . Let 's not go into that . ' ' All right . ' ' I 'm not going to have any more fights . Ever . You never fight and you can fight as well as I can . ' ' I ca n't fight as well as you . But I just made up my mind I would n't fight . ' ' I 'm not going to fight and I 'm going to be some good and quit writing junk . ' ' That 's the best thing I 've heard you say , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Do you think I could write something that would be worth a damn ? ' You could try . What did you quit painting for ? ' Because I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer on the writing either . ' ' What are you going to do , practically ? ' Go some place and write a good straight novel as well as I can write it . '  |p72'Why  do n't you stay here and write ? You can stay on here after the boys are gone . It 's too hot to write in your place . ' ' I would n't bother you too much ? ' ' No , Roge . I get lonely , too , you know . You ca n't just run away from everything all the time . This sounds like a speech . I 'll cut it out . ' ' No . Go on . I need it . ' ' If you are going to start to work , start here . ' ' You do n't think out West would be better ? ' ' Any place is good . The thing is not to run from it . ' ' No .

You 'd have company when you quit work and so would I. We would n't interfere with each other and you could really bite on the nail . ' ' Do you truly think I could write a novel that would be any good ? ' ' You never will if you do n't try . You told me a hell of a good novel tonight if you wanted to write it . Just start with the canoe  --  ' ' And end it how ? ' ' Make it up after the canoe . ' ' Hell , ' Roger said . ' I 'm so corrupted that if I put in a canoe it would have a beautiful Indian girl in it that young Jones , who is on his way to warn the settlers that Cecil B. de Mille is coming , would drop into , hanging by one hand to a tangle of vines that covers the river while he holds his trusty flintlock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful Indian girl says , " Jones , it ees you . Now we can make love as our frail craft moves towards the falls that some day weel be Niagara . " ' ' No , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' You could just make the canoe and the cold lake and your kid brother  --  ' ' David Davis . Eleven . ' ' And afterwards . And then make up from there to the end . ' ' I do n't like the end , ' Roger said . ' I do n't think any of us do , really , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' But there 's always an end . ' ' Maybe we better knock off talking , ' Roger said . ' I 'm liable to start thinking about the novel . Tommy , why is it fun to paintp73well and hell to write well ? I never painted well . But it was fun even the way I painted . ' ' I do n't know , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Maybe in painting the tradition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when you break from the straight line of great painting , it is always there to help you . ' ' I think another thing is that better people do it , ' Roger said . ' If f were a good enough guy maybe I could have been a good painter . Maybe I 'm just enough of a son of a bitch to be a good writer . ' ' That 's the worst oversimplification I 've ever heard . ' ' I always oversimplify , ' Roger maintained . ' That 's one reason I 'm no damn good . ' ' Let 's go to bed . ' ' I 'll stay up and read a while , ' Roger said . They slept well and Thomas Hudson did not wake when Roger came out to the sleeping porch late in the night . After breakfast the wind was light and there were no clouds in the sky and they organized for a day of underwater fishing . ' You 're coming , are n't you , Mr Davis ? ' Andrew asked . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Andrew . ' I 'm glad . ' ' How do you feel , Andy ? ' Thomas Hudson asked . ' Scared , ' said Andrew . ' Like always . But I 'm not so scared with Mr Davis going . ' ' Never be scared , Andy , ' Roger said . ' It 's worthless . Your father told me . ' ' They tell you , ' Andrew said . ' They always tell you . But David 's the only young boy I ever knew with any brains that is n't scared . ' ' Shut up , ' David said . ' You 're just a creature of your imagina-tion . ' ' Mr Davis and I are always scared , ' Andrew said . ' It 's possibly our superior intelligence . ' ' You 're going to be careful , Davy , are n't you ? ' Thomas Hudsonsaid . ' Naturally . ' Andrew looked at Roger and shrugged his shoulders.  |p74DowN  along the reef where they went for underwater fishing on that day , there was the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at high tide the rusty iron of her boilers still showed above the sea . Today the wind was in the south and Thomas Hudson anchored in the lee of a patch of reef , not too close in , and Roger and the boys got their masks and spears ready . The spears were very primitive , and of all sorts , and these spears were made according to Thomas Hudson 's and the boys ' individual ideas . Joseph had come along to scull the dinghy . He took Andrew in with him and they started for the reef while the others slipped over the side to swim . ' Are n't you coming , papa ? ' David called up to his father on the flying bridge of his fishing boat . The circle of glass over his eyes , nose , and forehead , with the rubber frame pressed under his nose , into his cheeks , and tight against his forehead , held tight into the flesh by a rubber strap around the back of his head , made him look like one of the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over later on . ' ' Do n't wait too long until everything gets spooked . ' ' There 's plenty of reef . You wo n't work it all over . ' ' But I know two holes out beyond the boilers that are wonderful . I found them the day we came alone . They were so untouchedand full of fish I left them for when we would all be here . ' ' I remember . I 'll come over in about an hour . ' ' I 'll save them for when you come , ' David said and started to swim after the others , his right hand holding the six-foot ironwoodshaft with the hand-forged , twin-pronged fish grains fitted to the end and made fast with a length of heavy fishing line . His face was down in the water and he was studying the bottom through the glass of his mask as he swam . He was an undersea boy and now that he was so brown and that he was swimming with only the wet back of his head showing he reminded Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim along , using his left arm and kicking with his long legs and feet in a slow steady drive and occasionally , and each time much , much longer than you thought it would be , lifting his face a little to one side to breathe . Roger and his oldest boy had swum out with their masks up on their foreheadsand were a long way ahead . Andrew and Joseph were over the reef in the dinghy but Andrew had not gone overboard yet . There was only a light wind and the water over the reef looked light and creaming , with the reef showing brown and the dark blue water beyond . Thomas Hudson went below to the galley where Eddy was peeling potatoes over a bucket held between his knees . He was looking out the porthole of the galley towards the reef . ' Boys ought n't to scatter , ' he said . ' Ought to keep close to the dinghy . ' ' Do you think anything would come in over the reef ? ' ' Tide 's pretty well up . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Bad things in the ocean , ' Eddy said . ' This is a tough ocean around here if they get to smell that fish . ' ' They have n't got any fish yet . ' ' They 'll get them soon . They want to get those fish right into that dinghy before any fish smell or any blood smell trails on that tide . ' ' I 'll swim out . ' ' No . You holler at them to stay close together and keep the fish in the dinghy . ' Thomas Hudson went up on deck and shouted what Eddy had said to Roger . He held up his spear and waved that he had understood . Eddy came up into the cockpit with the pot full of potatoes in one hand and his knife in the other . ' You take that good rifle , the little good one , and get up on the topside , Mr Tom , ' he said . ' I just do n't like it . I do n't like boys out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real ocean . ' ' Let 's get them in . ' ' No . Chances are I just get nervous . Bad night last night anyway . I 'm fond of them like they 're my boys and I worry the hell about them . ' He put the pot of potatoes down . ' Tell you what let 's do . Start her up and I , ' ll get the anchor up and we 'll run inp76closer to the reef and anchor . She 'll swing clear with this tide and the wind . Let 's put her right in . ' Thomas Hudson started the big motor and went up to the flyingbridge and the topside controls . Ahead , as Eddy got the anchorup , he could see them all in the water now and , as he watched , David came up from underwater with a fish flopping on his spear that he held high in the air and Thomas Hudson heard him shout for the dinghy . ' Put her nose right against the reef , ' Eddy called from the bow where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to almost touch the reef , seeingthe big brown coral heads , the black sea urchins on the sand , and the purple sea fans swaying towards him with the tide . Eddy heaved the anchor and Thomas Hudson came astern on the engine . The boat swung off and the reef slid away . Eddy paid out line until the rope came taut and Thomas Hudson cut the motor and they swung there . ' Now we can keep an eye on them , ' Eddy said , standing in the bow . ' I ca n't stand worrying about those kids . Ruins my damn digestion . Bad enough the way it is now . ' ' I 'll stay up here and watch them . ' ' I 'll pass you up the rifle and get the hell back to those potatoes . The boys like potato salad , do n't they ? The way we fix it ? ' ' Sure . Roger too . Put in plenty of hard-boiled egg and onion . ' ' I 'll keep the potatoes good and firm . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rifle it was chunky and heavy in its clipped sheep-wool-lined case that he kept saturated with Fiend-oil to keep the sea air from rusting it . He pulled it out by the butt and slid the case under the decking on the flying bridge . It was a .256 Mannlicher Shoenauer with the old eighteeninchbarrel they were n't allowed to sell any more . The stock and forearm were browned like a walnut nutmeat with oil and rubbing , and the barrel , rubbed from months of carrying in a saddle bucket , was oil-slick , without a spot of rust . The cheek piece of the stock was worn smooth from his own cheek and when he pulled back the bolt the revolving magazine was full of heavy bellied cartridges with the long , thin , pencil-shaped metal-cased bullet with only a tiny exposed lead tip . It was really too good a gun to keep on a boat but Thomasp77Hudson was so fond of it and it reminded him of so many things , so many people , and so many places that he liked to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepskin case , once the clippedwool was well impregnated with the Fiend-oil , the rifle was not harmed at all by the salt air . A gun is to shoot anyway , he thought , not to be preserved in a case , and this was a really good rifle , easy to shoot , easy to teach anyone to shoot with , and handy on the boat . He had always had more confidence shooting it , as to being able to place his shots at close and moderate range , than any other rifle he had ever owned and it made him happy to pull it out of the case now and pull back the bolt and shove a shell into the breech . The boat lay almost steady in the tide and the breeze , and he slipped the sling of the rifle over one of the levers of the topside controls so that the rifle hung there handy , and lay down on the sunning mattress on the flying bridge . Lying on his belly to brown his back , he looked out to where Roger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying down varying lengths of time and coming up for air to disappear again , occasionally coming up with fish on the spears . Joseph was sculling from one to another to take the fish off the spear points and drop them into the dinghy . He could hear Joseph shouting and laughing and see the bright colour of the fish , red or red with brown speckles or red and yellow or striped yellow , as Joseph shook them off the spears or pulled them loose and tossed them back into the shade under the stern of the dinghy . ' Let me have a drink , Eddy , will you please ? ' Thomas Hudson called down over the side . ' What 's it to be ? ' Eddy stuck his head out of the forward cockpit . He was wearing his old felt hat and a white shirt and in the bright sun his eyes were bloodshot and Thomas Hudson noticed he had Mercurochrome on his lips . ' What did you do to your mouth ? ' he asked him . ' Some sort of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it show bad ? ' ' It makes you look like some back island whore . ' ' Oh hell , ' said Eddy . ' I put it on without looking at it in the dark . Just by the feel . Do you want a drink with coconut water ? I got some water coconuts . ' ' Very good . '  |p78'Want  a Green Isaac 's Special ? ' ' Fine . Make it a Special . ' Where Thomas Hudson lay on the mattress his head was in the shade cast by the platform at the forward end of the flying bridge where the controls were and when Eddy came aft with the tall cold drink made of gin , lime juice , green coconut water , and chipped ice with just enough Angostura bitters to give it a rusty , rose colour , he held the drink in the shadow so the ice would not melt while he looked out over the sea . ' Boys seem to be doing all right , ' Eddy said . ' We 've got fish for dinner already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mashed potatoes with the fish . Got some tomato salad , too . That potato salad to start with . ' ' Sounds fine . How 's that potato salad ? ' ' It is n't cold yet , Tom . ' ' Eddy , you like to cook , do n't you ? ' ' Damn right I like to cook . I like going in a boat and I like to cook . What I do n't like is rows and fights and trouble . ' ' You used to be pretty good at trouble , though . ' ' I always avoided it , Tom . Sometimes you ca n't avoid it but I always tried to . ' ' What was it last night ? ' ' Nothing . ' He did n't want to talk about it . He never talked about the old days either when there had been plenty of trouble . ' All right . What else is there to eat ? We have to feed them up . They 're growing boys . ' ' I made a cake at the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pineapples cold in the ice . I 'll slice them up . ' ' Good . How will we have the fish ? ' ' Any way you want it . Let 's see what the best is of what they get , then cook it how they and you and Roger want it . David just got a good yellowtail . He had another one but he lost it . This one 's a big flaggy . He 's getting far out , though . He 's still got the fish and Joe 's the hell over towards Andy with the dinghy . ' Thomas Hudson put the drink down in the shade and stood up . ' Jesus Christ , ' Eddy said . ' There it comes ! ' Out across the blue water , showing like a brown dinghy sailp79a nd slicing through the water with heavy , tail-propelled , lunging thrusts , the high triangular fin was coming in towards the hole at the edge of the reef where the boy with the mask on his face held his fish up out of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son of a bitching hammerhead . Jesus , Tom . Oh Jesus . ' Thomas Hudson remembered , afterwards , the main impression he had was the great height of the fin , the way it turned and swung like a hound on a scent , and the way it knifed forward and still seemed to wobble . He had the .256 up and shot just ahead of the fin . The shot was over and threw a spurt of water and he remembered the barrel was sticky with oil . The fin went right on weaving in . ' Throw him the goddam fish , ' Eddy yelled to David and jumped off the back of the house down into the cockpit . Thomas Hudson shot again and was behind with another spurt of water . He felt sick at his stomach , as though something had hold of him inside and was gripping him there , and he shot again ; as carefully and steady as he could ; knowing fully what the shot meant ; and the spurt of water was ahead of the fin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had one shot now , no extra shells , and the shark was about thirty yards from the boy , coming in with the same slicing motion . David had the fish off the spear and in his hand , the mask was up on his forehead , and he was looking steadily towards the shark coming . Thomas Hudson was trying to be loose but steady , trying to hold his breath and not to think of anything but the shot ; to squeeze and keep just a touch ahead and at the base of the fin which was wobbling more now than it had at the start when he heard the submachine gun start firing from the stern and saw water start to spout all around the fin . Then it clattered again in a short burst and the water jumped in a tighter patch right at the base of the fin . As he shot , the clatter came again , short and tight , and the fin went under and there was a boil in the water and then the biggest hammerhead he had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off over the water crazily , on his back , throwing water like an aquaplane . His belly was shining an obscene white , his yard-wide mouth like a turned-up grin , the great horns of his head with the eyes on the end , spread wide out as he bounced and slid over the water , Eddy 's gun rapping andp8oripping into the white of his belly making black spots that were red before he turned and went down and Thomas Hudson could see him rolling over and over as he sank . ' Get those goddamned kids in here , ' he heard Eddy shouting . ' 1 ca n't stand this sort of thing . ' Roger had swum fast towards David , and Joseph was pulling Andy into the dinghy and then sculling out towards the other two . ' Goddamn , ' Eddy said . ' Did you ever see such a hammerhead ? Thank God they show on the surface when they hook up . Thank God for that . The bastards always get on top . Did you see him go ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He was shaky and hollow sick feeling inside . ' Come on in here , ' he shouted . They were swimming alongside of the dinghy and Roger was pushing David up over the gunwale . ' They might as well fish , ' Eddy said . ' Any shark in the ocean will go for him now . He 'll call the whole ocean up . Did you see him go on his back , Tom , and then that damned roll ? Jesus , what a hammerhead . Did you see the kid with the fish ready to throw him ? That 's my Davy boy . Oh what a old Davy boy . ' ' They better come in . ' ' Sure they better . I was just talking . They 'll come in . Do n't worry they wo n't come in . ' ' God , it was a terrible thing . Where did you have that gun ? ' ' Commissioner made some trouble about me having it ashore so I 've been keeping it in the locker under my bunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , who could n't shoot it with that shark going towards that old Davy boy waiting there quiet with that fish to throw ? Lookingstraight at where the shark was coming . Hell , I do n't care if I never see anything else in my goddamn life . ' They came up over the side out of the dinghy . The kids were wet and very excited and Roger was very shaken . He went over and shook hands with Eddy and Eddy said , ' We never should have let them get out like that on this tide . ' Roger shook his head and put his arm around Eddy . ' My fault , ' Eddy said . ' I was born here . You 're a stranger . It was n't your fault . I 'm the one that 's responsible . ' ' You lived up to your responsibilities all right , ' Roger said.  |p81'Hell  , ' Eddy said . ' Nobody could miss him at that range . ' ' Could you see him , Dave ? ' Andrew asked very politely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I could see him beforeEddy hit him and he went down and then came out on his back : Eddy was rubbing him with a towel and Thomas Hudson couldsee the goose pimples still over his legs and back and shoulders . ' I never saw anything like when he came out of water andstarted to go on his back , ' young Tom said . ' I never saw anything in the world like that . ' ' You wo n't see a lot of things like that , ' his father told him . ' He must have weighed eleven hundred pounds , ' Eddy said . ' I do n't think they make a bigger hammerhead . Jesus , Roger , did you see that fin on him ? ' ' I saw it , ' Roger said . ' Do you think we can get him ? ' David asked . ' Hell no , ' Eddy said . ' He went down rolling over and over to hell knows where . He 's down in eighty fathoms and the whole ocean will eat on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish we could have got him , ' David said .

' Then I was going to hit him in themiddle of his face with the grains . ' ' Oh hell , ' Eddy said and he turned away with the towel . ' What do you want to drink , Roger ?

' Do n't tell them if I 'm going there . ' ' Why ? ' young Tom asked . ' I do n't know , ' David said . Then he started to cry like a little boy . ' Oh shit , I could n't stand it if they did n't believe it . ' Thomas Hudson picked him up and held him in his arms with his head against his chest and the other kids turned away and Roger looked away and then Eddy came out with three drinks with his thumb in one of them .

' Nothing will bother you , ' Eddy said . ' There 's morays . But nothingbig will come in . They ca n't make it at low tide . ' ' Can we go at low tide , papa ? ' ' If Eddy says so . Eddy 's the boss man . ' ' Hell , Tom , ' Eddy said , and he was very happy , his Mercurochromedlips were happy and his bloodshot eyes as happy as eyes could be .

' They sat there waiting for the lunch and Thomas Hudson was looking out to sea where Joseph had sculled out to where the shark had gone down . Joseph was looking over the side of the dinghy into a water glass . ' Can you see anything ? ' Thomas Hudson called to him . ' Too deep , Mr Tom . He went right down over the shelf . He 's laying on the bottom now . '  |p83'I  wish we could have gotten his jaws , ' young Tom said . ' Would n't you like to have them all bleached and hanging up , papa ?

' ' Eat some more fish , David , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Which is that big yellowtail ? ' ' I do n't believe he 's cooked yet . ' ' I 'll take a yellow grunt then . ' ' They 're awfully sweet .

' ' Papa , can I ask him to have another one with us now and to eat with us ? ' ' Of course , ' Thomas Hudson said .

' ' Hell , Tommy , ' Eddy said . ' I never eat at noon . I just eat breakfastand at night . ' ' What about having a drink with us ? ' I had a couple , Tommy . ' ' Will you take one with me now and let me drink a bottle of beer with you ? ' ' Hell yes , ' said Eddy . Thomas Hudson heard the icebox open and close . ' Here 's to you , Tommy .

If I ever run out I 'll borrow some of Roger 's and your old man 's . ' Well , then , I 'll take the fish up , ' young Tom said . ' I 'm awfully glad you feel so good , Eddy . I think it 's wonderful . ' Young Tom brought the platter of yellowtail , yellow and white grunts , and rock hind up into the cockpit . They were scored deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fried crisp and brown , and he started to pass them around the table . ' Eddy said to thank you very much but he 'd had a drink , ' he said . And he does n't eat lunch . Is this fish all right ? ' ' It 's excellent , ' Thomas Hudson told him . ' Please eat , ' he said to Roger . All right , ' Roger said . I 'll try . ' ' Have n't you eaten anything , Mr Davis ? ' Andrew asked . ' No , Andy . But I 'm going to eat now . ' 8I N the night Thomas Hudson would wake and hear the boys asleep and breathing quietly and in the moonlight he could see them all and see Roger sleeping too . He slept well now and almostwithout stirring . Thomas Hudson was happy to have them there and he did not want to think about them ever going away . He had been happy before they came and for a long time he had learned how to live and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ; but the boys ' coming had broken all the protective routine of life he had built and now he was used to its being broken . It had been a pleasant routine of working hard ; of hours for doing things ; places where things were kept and well-cared for ; of meals and drinks to look forward to and new books to read and many old books to reread . It was a routine where thep88daily paper was an event when it arrived , but where it did not come so regularly that its nonarrival was a disappointment . It had many of the inventions that lonely people use to save themselves and even achieve unloneliness with and he had made the rules and kept the customs and used them consciously and unconsciously . But since the boys were here it had come as a great relief not to have to use them . It would be bad , though , he thought , when he started all that again . He knew very well how it would be . For a part of a day it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read without hearing other people talk and look at things withoutspeaking of them and work properly without interruption and then he knew the loneliness would start . The three boys had moved into a big part of him again that , when they moved out , would be empty and it would be very bad for a while . His life was built solidly on work and on the living by the Gulf Stream and on the island and it would stand up all right . The aids and the habits and the customs were all to handle the loneliness and by now he knew he had opened a whole new country for the loneliness to move into once the boys were gone . There was nothing to do about that , though . That would all come later and if it was coming there was no good derived from any fearing of it now . The summer , so far , had been a very lucky and good one . Everything had turned out well that could have turned out badly . He did not mean just spectacular things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come out very badly ; nor David and the shark ; but all sorts of small things had come out well . Happiness is often presented as being very dull but , he thought , lying awake , that is because dull people are sometimes very happy and intelligent people can and do go around making themselves and everyone else miserable . He had never found happiness dull . It always seemed more exciting than any other thing and capable of as great intensity as sorrow to those people who were capable of having it . This may not be true but he had believedit to be true for a long time and this summer they had experienced happiness for a month now and , already , in theknights , he was lonely for it before it had ever gone away . He knew almost what there is to know about living alone and he had known what it is to live with someone that you loved andp89that loved you . He had always loved his children but he had never before realized how much he loved them and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished that he had them always and that he was married to Tom 's mother . Then he thought that was as silly as wishing you had the wealth of the world to use as intelligently as you could ; to be able to draw like Leonardo or paint as well as Pieter Brueghel ; to have an absolute veto power against all wickedness and be able to detect it infalliblyand always justly when it starts and stop it with something as simple as pressing a button and while doing all this to be always healthy and to live forever and not decay in mind nor body . That was what he thought tonight would be some good things to have . But you could not have them any more than you could have the children ; nor that who you loved could be alive if who you loved was dead or gone out from your life . Out of all the things you could not have there were some that you could have and one of those was to know when you were happy and to enjoy all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were many things that made it for him when he had it . But just now , in this month , four people made it something that was as good , in some ways , as what the one person had once been able to make and so far there had been no sorrow . There had been no sorrow at all . He did not even mind being awake now and remembered how it had been once when he had not been able to sleep and had lain in the night thinking about how he had lost the three boys and the fool he had been . He had thought how he had done things because he could not help them , or thought he could not help them , and had moved from one disastrous error of judgment to another that was worse . Now he accepted that as past and he was through with remorse . He had been a fool and he did not like fools . But that was over now and the boys were here and they loved him and he loved them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would go away at the end of their stay and he would have the loneliness again . But it would be only a stage on the way until they came back . If Roger would stay and work and / keep him company it would be much easier . But he never knew about Roger nor what he would do . He smiled in the night thinkingabout Roger . Then he pitied him until he thought how dis/loyal it was and how Roger would hate pity and he stopped it and , hearing them all breathing quietly , he went to sleep . But he woke again when the moonlight came on his face and he started to think about Roger and the women he had been in trouble with . He and Roger had both behaved stupidly and badly with women . He did not want to think of his own stupidities so he would think of Roger 's . I wo n't pity him , he thought , so it is not disloyal . I have been in enough trouble myself so that it is not disloyal to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only really loved one woman and then lost her . I know well enough why . But I am through with thinking about that and it would probably be well not to think about Roger either . But tonight , because of the moonlight which , as always , would not let him sleep , he thought about him and his serious and comic troubles . He thought about the last girl Roger had been in love with in Paris when they had both lived there and how very handsome and how very false he thought she was when Roger had brought her to the studio . For Roger there was nothing false about her . She was another of his illusions and all his great talent for being faithful was at her service until they were both free to marry . Then , in a month , everything that had always been clear about her to everyone who knew her well was suddenly clear to Roger . It must have been a difficult day when it first happened but the process of seeing her clearly had been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . He had looked at the canvases for a while and spoken critically and very intelligently about them . Then he said , ' I told that Ayers I would n't marry her . ' Good , ' Thomas Hudson had said . Was it a surprise ? ' Not too much . There 'd been some talk about it . She 's a phoney . ' ' No , ' Thomas Hudson had said . How ? ' Right through . Any way you slice her . ' I thought you liked her . ' No . I tried to like her . But I could n't make it except at the start . I was in love with her . ' What 's in love ? ' You ought to know . ' ' Yes , ' Thomas Hudson had said . ' I ought to know . '  |p91'Did  n't you like her ? ' ' No . I could n't stand her . ' ' Why did n't you say anything ? ' ' She was your girl . And you did n't ask me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it stick . ' ' You better pull out . ' ' No , ' he said . ' Let her pull out . ' ' I only thought it might be simpler . ' ' This is my town as much as it is hers . ' ' I know , ' Thomas Hudson had said . ' You fought that one out , too , did n't you ? ' Roger had asked . ' Yes . You ca n't win on any of them . But you can fight them out . Why do n't you just move your quartier ? ' ' I 'm all right where I am , ' Roger had said . ' I remember the formula . Je me trouve tres bien ici et je vous prie de me laisser tranquille . ' ' It starts with je refuse de recevoir ma femme , ' Roger had said . ' And you say it to a huissier . But this is n't a divorce . It 's just breaking up . ' ' But is n't it going to be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to cure me . That and hearing her talk . ' ' What about her ? ' ' She can figure that out for herself . She 's figured plenty out in the last four years . ' ' Five , ' Thomas Hudson had said . ' I do n't think she was doing so much figuring the first year . ' ' You 'd better clear out , ' Thomas Hudson had said . ' If you do n't think she was figuring the first year you 'd better go a long way away . ' ' She writes very powerful letters . Going away would be worse . No . I 'm going to stay here and go on the town . I 'm going to cure it for keeps . ' After he and this girl split up in Paris , Roger was on the town ; really on the town . He joked about it and made fun of himself ; but he was very angry inside for having made such a profound fool of himself and he took his talent for being faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , next to the ones for painting and writing and his various good human and animal traits , and beat and belaboured that talent miserably . He was no good to anyone when he was on the town , especially to himself , and he knew itp92and hated it and he took pleasure in pulling down the pillars of the temple . It was a very good and strongly built temple and when it is constructed inside yourself it is not so easy to pull down . But he did as good a job as he could . He had three girls in a row , no one of whom Thomas Hudson could be more than civil to and the only excuse for the last two might have been that they reminded him of the first one . This first one came right after the one he had just broken up with and she was sort of a world low for Roger although she went on to have a very successful career both in and out of bed and got herself a good piece of one of the third or fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was named Thanis and Thomas Hudson remembered how Roger could never hear it without wincing and he would n't say it ; no one ever heard him say the name . He used to call her Bitchy the Great . She was dark with a lovely skin and she looked like a very young , wellgroomed , fastidiously vicious member of the Cenci family . She had the morals of a vacuum cleaner and the soul of a pari-mutuel machine , a good figure , and that lovely vicious face , and she only stayed with Roger long enough to get ready for her first good step upwards in life . She was the first girl that had ever left him and that impressed Roger so that he had two more that looked almost enough like her to be members of the same family . He left both of them , though , really left them , and Thomas Hudson thought that made him feel better ; though not a hell of a lot better . There are probably politer ways and more endearing ways of leaving a girl than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row , excusing yourself to go to the men 's room at 21 and never coming back . But , as Roger said , he did settle the check downstairs and he loved to think of his last glimpse of her , sitting alone at the corner table in that decor that suited her so and that she loved so well . He planned to leave the other one at the Stork , which was the place she really loved , but he was afraid Mr Billingsley might not like it and he needed to borrow some money from Mr Billingsley . So where did you leave her ? ' Thomas Hudson had asked him . At El Morocco . So I could always remember her sitting there among those zebras . She loved El Morocco too , ' he said . But I think it was the Cub Room that was graven on her heart . '  |p93After  that he got mixed up with one of the most deceptive women Thomas Hudson had ever known . She was a complete change from his last three Cenci or Park Avenue Borgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawny hair and long , good legs , a very good figure , and an intelligent , lively face . Though it was not beautiful it was much better-looking than most faces . And she had beautiful eyes . She was intelligent and very kindly and charming when you first knew her and she was a complete rummy . She was not a lush and her alcoholism had not showed yet . But she was just at it all of the time . Usually you can tell someone who is really drinking by their eyes and it always showed in Roger 's immediately . But this girl , Kathleen , had really beautiful tawny eyes that went with her hair and the little pleasant freckles of health and good nature around her nose and her cheeks ; and you never saw anything in them of what was going on . She looked like a girl who was sailing regularly or living some sort of very healthy outdoor life and she looked like a girl who was very happy . Instead she was just a girl who was drinking . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she took Roger with her . But he came up to the studio Thomas Hudson had rented in New York one morning with the back of his left hand covered with cigarette burns . It looked as though someone had been puttingbutts out by rubbing them against a tabletop ; only the tabletopwas the back of his hand . ' That 's what she wanted to do last night , ' he said . ' Have you got any iodine ? I did n't like to take those things into a drugstore . ' ' Who 's she ? ' ' Kathleen . The fresh outdoor type . ' ' You had to participate . ' ' It seemed to amuse her and we 're supposed to amuse them . ' ' You 're burned pretty badly . ' ' Not really . But I 'm going to get out of this town for a while . ' ' You 'll be taking yourself along wherever you go . ' ' Yes . But I wo n't be taking a lot of other people I know with me . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out West for a while . ' ' Geography is n't any cure for what 's the matter with you . ' ' No . But a healthy life and plenty of work wo n't hurt . Notp94drinking may not cure me . But drinking sure as hell is n't helping any now . ' Well , get the hell out then . Do you want to go to the ranch ? ' Do you still own it ? ' Part of it . ' Is it all right if I go out there ? ' Sure , ' Thomas Hudson had told him . ' But it 's rugged from now on until spring and spring is n't easy . ' ' I want it to be rugged , ' Roger had said . ' I 'm going to start new again . ' How many times is it now you 've started new ? ' ' Too many , ' Roger had said . ' And you do n't have to rub it in . ' So now he was going to start new again and how would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting his talent and writing to order and following a formula that made money could fit him to write well and truly ? Everything that a painter did or that a writer wrote was a part of his training and preparation for what he was to do . Roger had thrown away and abused and spent his talent . But perhaps he had enough animal strength and detached intelligence so that he could make another start . Any writer of talent should be able to write one good novel if he were honest , Thomas Hudson thought . But all the time that he should be training for it Roger had been misusing his talent and how could you know if his talent still was there ? To say nothing of his metier , he thought . How can anyone think that you can neglectand despise , or have contempt for craftsmanship , however feigned the contempt may be , and then expect it to be at the service of your hands and of your brain when the time comes when you must have it . There is no substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for talent either and you do n't have to keep them in a chalice . The one is inside you . It is in your heart and in your head and in every part of you . So is the other , he thought . It is not just a set of tools that you have learned to work with . It is luckier to be a painter , he thought , because you have more things to work with . We have the advantage of working with our hands and the metier we have mastered is an actual tangible thing . But Roger must start now to use what he has blunted and perverted and cheapened and all of it is in his head . But au fondp95he has something fine and sound and beautiful . That is a word I would need to be very careful of if I were a writer , he thought . But he has the thing that is the way he is and if he could write the way he fought on the dock it could be cruel but it would be very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought after that fight he would be very good . The moonlight did not shine on the head of Thomas Hudson 's bed any more and gradually he stopped thinking about Roger . Thinking about him does n't do any good . Either he can do it or he ca n't . But it would be wonderful if he could do it . I wish that I could help him . Maybe I can , he thought , and then he was asleep . WHEN the sun woke Thomas Hudson he went down to the beach and swam and then had breakfast before the rest of them were up . Eddy said he did not think they would have much of a breeze and it might even be a calm . He said the gear was all in good shape on the boat and he had a boy out after bait . Thomas Hudson asked him if he had tested the lines since the boat had not been out for big fish in quite a while and Eddy said he had tested them and taken off all the line that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some more thirty-six thread line and plenty more twenty-four thread and Thomas Hudson promised to send for it . In the meantime Eddy had spliced enough good line on to replace the discarded line and both the big reels had all they would hold . He had cleaned and sharpened all of the big hooks and checked all the leaders and swivels . ' When did you do all this ? ' ' I sat up last night splicing , ' he said . ' Then I worked on that new cast net . Could n't sleep with the goddam moon . ' ' Does a full moon bother you for sleeping too ? ' ' Gives me hell , ' Eddy said . ' Eddy do you think it 's really bad for you to sleep with it shining on you ? ' ' That 's what the old heads say . I do n't know . Always makes me feel bad , anyway . '  |p96'Do  you think we 'll do anything today ? ' ' Never know . There 's some awfully big fish out there this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Isaacs ? ' ' The boys want to go up there . ' ' We ought to get going right after breakfast . I 'm not figuring to cook lunch . I 've got conch salad and potato salad and beer and I 'll make up sandwiches . We 've got a ham that came over on the last run-boat and I 've got some lettuce and we can use mustard and that chutney . Mustard does n't hurt kids , does it ? ' ' I do n't think so . ' ' We never had it when I was a kid . Say , that chutney 's good , too . You ever eat it in a sandwich ? ' ' No . ' ' I did n't know what it was for when you first got it and I tried some of it like a marmalade . It 's damned good . I use it sometimes on grits . ' ' Why do n't we have some curry pretty soon ? ' ' I got a leg of lamb coming on the next run-boat . Wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , with that young Tom and Andrew eating , and we 'll have a curry . ' ' Fine . What do you want me to do about getting off ? ' ' Nothing , Tom . Just get them going . Want me to make you adrink ? You are n't working today . Might as well have one . ' ' I 'll drink a cold bottle of beer with breakfast . ' ' Good thing . Cut that damn phlegm . ' ' Is Joe here yet ? ' ' No . He went after the boy that 's gone for bait . I 'll put your breakfast out there . ' ' No , let me take her . ' ' No , go on in there and drink a cold bottle of beer and read the paper . I 've got her all ironed out for you . I 'll bring the breakfast . ' Breakfast was corned-beef hash , browned , with an egg on top of it , coffee and milk , and a big glass of chilled grapefruit juice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank a very cold bottle of Heineken beer with the hash . ' I 'll keep the juice cold for the kids , ' Eddy said . ' That 's some beer , is n't it , for early in the morning ? ' ' It would be pretty easy to be a rummy , would n't it , Eddy ? ' ' You 'd never make a rummy . You like to work too well . ' ' Drinking in the morning feels awfully good though . '  |p97'You  're damned right it does . Especially something like that beer . ' ' I could n't do it and work though . ' ' Well , you 're not working today so what 's the goddam problem ? Drink that one up and I 'll get you another . ' ' No . One 's all I want . ' They got off by nine o'clock and went down the channel with the tide . Thomas Hudson was steering on the topside and he headed her out over the bar and ran straight out towards where he could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and so very clear that they could see the bottom clearly in thirty fathoms , see that sea fans bent with the tide current , still see it , but cloudily , at forty fathoms , and then it deepened and was dark and they were out in the dark water of the stream . ' It looks like a wonderful day , papa , ' Tom said . ' It looks like a good stream . ' ' It 's a fine stream . Look at the little curl of the whirlpools along the edge . ' ' Is n't this the same water that we have in on the beach in front of the house ? ' ' Sometimes , Tommy . Now the tide is out and it has pushed the Stream out from in front of the mouth of the harbour . See in there along the beach , where there is no opening , it 's made in again . ' ' It looks almost as blue in there as it is out here . What makes the Gulf water so blue ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altogether different type of water . ' ' The depth makes it darker , though . ' Only when you look down into it . Sometimes the plankton in it make it almost purple . ' ' Why ? ' ' Because they add red to the blue I think . I know they call the Red Sea red because the plankton make it look really red . They have terrific concentrations of them there . ' ' Did you like the Red Sea , papa ? ' ' I loved it . It was awfully hot but you never saw such wonderfulreefs and it 's full of fish on the two monsoons . You 'd like it , Tom . ' ' I read two books about it in French by Mr de Montfried . Theyp98were very good . He was in the slave trade . Not the white slave trade . The olden days slave trade . He 's a friend of Mr Davis . ' ' I know , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' I know him , too . ' ' Mr Davis told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the slave trade and when he would take a lady out anywhere he would have the taxi driver put down the top of the taxi and he would steer the taxi driver wherever he wanted to go by the stars . Say Mr de Montfried was on the Pont de la Concorde and he wanted to go to the Madeleine . He would n't just tell the taxi driver to take him to the Madeleine , or to cross the Place de la Concorde and go up the Rue Royale the way you or I would do it , papa . Mr de Montfried would steer himself to the Madeleineby the North Star . ' ' I never heard that one about Mr de Montfried , ' Thomas Hudsonsaid . ' I heard quite a lot of others . ' ' It 's quite a complicated way to get around in Paris , do n't you think ? Mr Davis wanted to go into the slave trade at one time with Mr de Montfried but there was some sort of a hitch . I do n't remember what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the slave trade and gone into the opium trade . That was it . ' ' Did n't Mr Davis want to go into the opium trade ? ' ' No . I remember he said he thought he 'd leave the opium trade to Mr de Quincey and Mr Cocteau . He said they 'd done so well in it that he did n't think it was right to disturb them . That was one of those remarks that I could n't understand . Papa , you explain anything to me that I ask but it used to slow the conversation up so much to be asking all the time that I would just remember certain things I did n't understand to ask about sometime and that 's one of those things . ' ' You must have quite a backlog of those things . ' ' I 've got hundreds of them . Possibly thousands . But I get rid of a lot of them every year by getting to understand them myself . But some I know I 'll have to ask you about . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an English composition . I 've got some awfully good ones for a composition of that sort . ' ' Do you like school , Tom ? ' ' It 's just one of those things you have to take . I do n't think anyone likes school , do they , that has ever done anything else ? ' ' I do n't know . I hated it . '  |p99'Did  n't you like art school either ? ' ' No . I liked to learn to draw but I did n't like the school part . ' ' I do n't really mind it , ' Tom said . ' But after you 've spent your life with men like Mr Joyce and Mr Pascin and you and Mr Davis , being with boys seems sort of juvenile . ' ' You have fun , though , do n't you ? ' ' Oh yes . I have lots of friends and I like any of the sports that are n't built around throwing or catching balls and I study quite hard . But papa , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I always felt about it , ' Thomas Hudson said . You liven it up as much as you can , though . ' ' I do . I liven it up all I can and still stay in it . Sometimes it 's a pretty close thing , though . ' Thomas Hudson looked astern where the wake ran crisply in the calm sea and the two baits from the outriggers were dragging ; dipping and leaping in the curl of the waves the wake raised as it cut the calm . David and Andrew sat in the two fishing chairs holding rods . Thomas Hudson saw their backs . Their faces were astern watching the baits . He looked ahead at some bonito jumping , not working and threshing the water , but coming up out and dropping back into the water singly and in pairs , making hardly any disturbance of the surface as they rose , shining in the sun , and returning , heavy heads down , to enter the water almost without splash . ' Fish ! ' Thomas Hudson heard young Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Behind you , Dave . Watch him ! ' Thomas Hudson saw a huge boil in the water but could not see the fish . David had the rod butt in the gimble and was looking up at the clothespin on the outrigger line . Thomas Hudson saw the line fall from the outrigger in a long , slow loop that tightened as it hit the water and now was racing out at a slant , slicing the water as it went . ' Hit him , Dave . Hit him hard , ' Eddy called from the companionway . ' Hit him , Dave . For God 's sake hit him , ' Andrew begged . ' Shut up , ' David said . ' I 'm handling him . ' He had n't struck yet and the line was steadily going out at that angle , the rod bowed , the boy holding back on it as the line moved out . Thomas Hudson had throttled the motors down so they were barely turning over.  |p100'Oh  for God 's sake , hit him , ' Andrew pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just held back on the rod and watched the line moving out at that same steady angle . He had loosened the drag . ' He 's a broadbill , papa , ' he said without looking up . ' I saw his sword when he took it . ' ' Honest to God ? ' Andrew asked . ' Oh boy . ' ' I think you ought to hit him now , ' Roger was standing with the boy now . He had the back out of the chair and he was bucklingthe harness on the reel . ' Hit him now , Dave , and really hit him . ' ' Do you think he 's had it long enough ? ' David asked . ' You do n't think he 's just carrying it in his mouth and swimming with it ? ' ' I think you better hit him before he spits it out . ' David braced his feet , tightened the drag well down with his right hand , and struck back hard against the great weight . He struck again and again bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily . He had made no impression on the fish . ' Hit him again , Dave , ' Roger said . ' Really put it into him . ' David struck again with all his strength and the line started zizzing out , the rod bent so that he could hardly hold it . ' Oh God , ' he said devoutly . ' I think I 've got it into him . ' ' Ease up on your drag , ' Roger told him . ' Turn with him , Tom , and watch the line . ' ' Turn with him and watch the line , ' Thomas Hudson repeated . ' You all right , Dave ? ' ' I 'm wonderful , papa , ' Dave said . ' Oh God , if I can catch this fish . ' Thomas Hudson swung the boat around almost on her stern . Dave 's line was fading off the reel and Thomas Hudson moved up on the fish . ' Tighten up and get that line in now , ' Roger said , ' Work on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lowered , lifting and reeling as he lowered , as regularly as a machine , and was getting back a good quantity of line on to his reel . ' Nobody in our family 's ever caught a broadbill , ' Andrew said . ' Oh keep your mouth off him , please , ' David said . ' Do n't put your mouth on him . '  |p101'I  wo n't , ' Andrew said . ' I 've been doing nothing but pray ever since you hooked him . ' ' Do you think his mouth will hold ? ' young Tom whispered to his father , who was holding the wheel and looking down into the stern and watching the slant of the white line in the dark water . ' I hope so . Dave is n't strong enough to be rough with him . ' ' I 'll do anything if we can get him , ' young Tom said . ' Anything . I 'll give up anything . I 'll promise anything . Get him some water , Andy . ' ' I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , old Dave boy . ' ' I do n't want him any closer , ' Roger called up . He was a great fisherman and he and Thomas Hudson understood each other perfectly in a boat . ' I 'll put him astern , ' Thomas Hudson called and swung the boat around very softly and easily so the stern hardly disturbed the ( aim sea . The fish was sounding now and Thomas Hudson backed the boat very slowly to ease the pressure on the line all that he could . But with only a touch of reverse with the stern moving slowly towards the fish the angle was all gone from the line and the rod tip was pointing straight down and the line kept going out in a series of steady jerks , the rod bucking each time in David 's hands . Thomas Hudson slipped the boat ahead just a thought so that the boy would not have the line so straight up and down in the water . He knew how it was pulling on his back in that position , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't put any more drag on or it will break , ' David said . ' What will he do , Mr Davis ? ' ' He 'll just keep on going down until you stop him , ' Roger said . ' Or until he stops . Then you 've got to try to get him up . ' The line kept going out and down , out and down , out and down . The rod was bent so far it looked as though it must break and the line was taut as a tuned cello string and there was not much more of it on the reel . ' What can I do , papa ? ' ' Nothing . You 're doing what there is to do . ' ' Wo n't he hit the bottom ? ' Andrew asked . ' There is n't any bottom , ' Roger told him . ' You hold him , Davy , ' Eddy said . ' He 'll get sick of it and comeup.  |p102These  damned straps are killing me , ' David said . ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to take him ? ' Andrew asked . ' No , you fool , ' David said . ' I just said what they were doing to me . I do n't care about it . ' ' See if you can rig him the kidney harness , ' Thomas Hudson called down to Eddy . ' You can tie it on with line if the straps arc too long . ' Eddy wrapped the broad , quilted pad across the small of the boy 's back and fastened the rings on the web straps that ran across it to the reel with heavy line . ' That 's much better , ' David said . ' Thank you very much , Eddy . ' ' Now you can hold him with your back as well as your shoulders , ' Eddy told him . ' But there is n't going to be any line . ' David said . ' Oh goddamn him , why does he have to keep on sounding ? ' ' Tom , ' Eddy called up . ' Ease her a little northwest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel and moved her softly , slowly , softly out to sea . There was a big patch of yellow gulf weed ahead with a bird on it and the water was calm and so blue and clear that , as you looked down into it , there were lights in it like the reflections from a prism . ' You see ? ' Eddy told David . ' You 're not losing any now . ' The boy could not raise the rod ; but the line was no longer jerking down into the water . It was as taut as ever and there were n't fifty yards left on the reel . But it was not going out . David was holding him and the boat was on his course . Thomas Hudson could see the just perceptible slant of the white line deep down in the blue water as the boat barely moved , its engines turning so quietly he could not hear them . ' You see , Davy , he went down to where he liked it and now he 's moving out to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some line on him . ' The boy 's brown back was arched , the rod bent , the line moved slowly through the water , and the boat moved slowly on the surface , and a quarter of a mile below the great fish was swimming . The gull left the patch of weed and flew towards the boat . He flew around Thomas Hudson 's head while he steered ,  |p103then  headed off towards another patch of yellow weed on the water . Try to get some on him now , ' Roger told the boy . ' If you can hold him you can get some . ' ' Put her ahead just a touch more , ' Eddy called to the bridge and Thomas Hudson eased her ahead as softly as he could . David lifted and lifted , but the rod only bent and the line only tightened . It was as though he were hooked to a moving anchor . ' Never mind , ' Roger told him . ' You 'll get it later . How are you , Davy ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness across my back I 'm fine . Do you think you can stay with him ? ' Andrew asked . ' Oh shut up , ' David said . ' Eddy , can I have a drink of water ? ' ' Where 'd I put it ? ' Eddy asked . ' I guess I spilled it . ' ' I ' 11 get one , ' Andrew went below . ' Can I do anything , Dave ? ' young Tom asked . ' I 'm going up so I wo n't be in the way . ' ' No , Tom . Goddamn it , why ca n't I lift on him ? ' ' He 's an awfully big fish , Dave , ' Roger told him . ' You ca n't bull him around . You 've got to lead him and try to convince him where he has to come . ' ' You tell me what to do and I 'll do it until I die , ' David said . ' I trust you . ' ' Do n't talk about dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk . ' I mean it , ' David said . ' I mean it really . ' Young Tom came back up on the flying bridge with his father . They were looking down at David , bent and harnessed to his fish , with Roger standing by him and Eddy holding the chair . Andrew was putting the glass of water to Dave 's mouth . He took some in and spat it out . Tour some on my wrists , will you , Andy ? ' he asked . ' Papa , do you think he can really stay with this fish ? ' Tom said to his father very softly . ' It 's an awful lot of fish for him . ' ' It scares me , ' Tom said . ' I love David and I do n't want any damned fish to kill him . ' ' Neither do I and neither does Roger and neither does Eddy . ' Well we 've got to look after him . If he gets in really bad thapc , Mr Davis ought to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way from bad shape yet . ' ' But you do n't know him like we do . He would kill himself to get the fish . ' ' Do n't worry , Tom . ' ' I ca n't help it , ' young Tom said . ' I 'm the one in the family that always worries . I hope I 'll get over it . ' ' I would n't worry about this now , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' But papa , how is a boy like David going to catch a fish like that ? He 's never caught anything bigger than sailfish and amber-jack . ' ' The fish will get tired . It 's the fish that has the hook in his mouth . ' ' But he 's monstrous , ' Tom said . ' And Dave 's fastened to him just as much as he is to Dave . It 's so wonderful I ca n't believe it if Dave catches him , but I wish you or Mr Davis had him . ' ' Dave 's doing all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time but it was still a flat calm . There were many patches of Gulf weed now , sunburnedso that they were yellow on the purple water , and sometimes the slow-moving taut white line ran through a patch of weed and Eddy reached down and cleared any weed that clung to the line . As he leaned over the coaming and pulled the yellow weed off the line and tossed it away , Thomas Hudson saw his wrinkled red brown neck and old felt hat and heard him say to Dave , ' He 's practically towing the boat , Davy . He 's way down there tiring himself and tiring himself all the time . ' ' He 's tiring me , too , ' David said . ' You got a headache ? ' Eddy asked . ' No . ' ' Get a cap for him , ' Roger said . ' I do n't want it , Mr Davis . I 'd rather have some water on my head . ' Eddy dipped a bucket of sea water and wet the boy 's head carefully with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair back out of his eyes . ' You say if you get a headache , ' he told him . ' I 'm fine , ' David said . ' You tell me what to do , Mr Davis . ' ' See if you can get any line on him , ' Roger said . David tried and tried and tried again but he could not raise the fish an inch.  |p105'All  right . Save your strength , ' Roger told him . Then to Eddy , ' Soak a cap and put it on him . This is a hell of a hot day with the calm . ' Eddy dipped a long-visored cap in the bucket of salt water and put it on Dave 's head . ' The salt water gets in my eyes , Mr Davis . Really . I 'm sorry . ' ' I 'll wipe it out with some fresh , ' Eddy said . ' Give me a handkerchief , Roger . You go get some ice water , Andy . ' While the boy hung there , his legs braced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept moving slowly out to sea . To the westward a school of either bonito or albacore were troubling t he calm of the surface and terns commenced to come flying , c alli.ng to each other as they flew . But the school of fish went down and the terns lit on the calm water to wait for the fish to come up again . Eddy had wiped the boy 's face and now was dipping the handkerchief in the glass of ice water and laying it across David 's neck . Then he cooled his wrists with it and then , with the handkerchief soaked in ice water again , wrung it out while he pressed it against the back of David 's neck . ' You say if you have a headache , ' Eddy told him . ' That ai n't quitting . That 's just sense . This is a hell of a goddamn hot sun when it 's a calm . ' ' I 'm all right , ' David told him . ' I hurt bad in the shoulders and the arms is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' That 'll make a man out of you . What we do n't want is for you to get no sunstroke nor bust any gut . ' ' What will he do now , Mr Davis ? ' David asked . His voice sounded dry . ' Maybe just what he 's doing . Or he might start to circle . Or he may come up . ' ' It 's a damn shame he sounded so deep at the start so we have n't any line to manoeuvre him with , ' Thomas Hudson said to Roger . ' Dave stopped him is the main thing , ' Roger said . ' Pretty soon the fish will change his mind . Then we 'll work on him . See if you can get any just once , Dave . ' David tried but he could not raise him at all . ' He 'll come up , ' Eddy said . ' You 'll see . All of a sudden there o n't he anything to it , Davy . Want to rinse your mouth out ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . Spit it out , ' Eddy said . ' Swallow just a little . ' He turned toRoger . ' One hour even , ' he said . ' Is your head all right , Davy ? ' The boy nodded . ' What do you think , papa ? ' young Tom said to his father . ' Truly ? ' ' He looks pretty good to me , ' his father said . Eddy would n't let anything happen to him . ' ' No , I guess not , ' Tom agreed . ' I wish I could do something useful . I 'm going to get Eddy a drink . ' ' Get me one , too , please . ' Oh good . I 'll make one for Mr Davis , too . ' ' I do n't think he wants one . ' ' Well I 'll ask him . ' ' Try him once more , Davy , ' Roger said very quietly , and the boy lifted with all his strength , holding the sides of the spool of the reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Roger said . ' Take it in and see if you can get some more . ' Now the real fight began . Before David had only been holding him while the fish moved out to sea and the boat moved with him . But now he had to lift , let the rod straighten with the line he had gained , and then lower the rod slowly while he took the line in by reeling . ' Do n't try to do it too fast , ' Roger told him . ' Do n't rush yourself . Just keep it steady . ' The boy was bending forward and pulling up from the soles of his feet , using all the leverage of his body and all of what weight he had on each lift ; then reeling fast with his right hand as he lowered . ' David fishes awfully pretty , ' young Tom said . He 's fished since he was a little boy but I did n't know he could fish this well . He always makes fun of himself because he ca n't play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell with games , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' What did you say , Roger ? ' Go ahead on him just a touch , ' Roger called up . ' Ahead on him just a touch , ' Thomas Hudson repeated and on the next lift , as they nudged slowly forward , David recovered more line.  |p107'Do  n't you like games either , papa ? ' Tom asked . ' I used to . Very much . But not any more . ' ' I like tennis and fencing , ' Torn said . ' The throw-and-catch ball games are the ones I do n't like . That 's from being brought up in Europe I guess . I 'll bet David could be a fine fencer if he wanted to learn because he has so much brains . But he does n't want to learn . All he wants to do is read and fish and shoot and tie flies . lie shoots better than Andy does in the field . He can tie beautiful flies too . Am I bothering you , papa , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He was holding to the rail of the flying bridge and looking aft as his father was and his father put one hand on his shoulder . It was salty from the buckets of sea water the boys had thrown over each other on the stern before the fish struck . The salt was very fine and felt faintly sandy under his hand . ' You see I got so nervous watching David I talk to take my mind off it . I 'd rather have David catch that fish than anything on earth . ' ' He 's a hell of a fish . Wait till we see him . ' ' I saw one one time when I was fishing with you years ago . He hit a big mackerel bait with his sword and he jumped and threw the hook . He was enormous and I used to dream about him . I 'll go down and make the drinks . ' ' There 's no hurry , ' his father told him . Down in the backless fighting chair , set in its swivel base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his arms , back , withers , and thighs ; then lowered and reeled and lifted again . Steadily , an inch , two inches , three inches at a time he was getting more and more line on the reel . ' Is your head all right ? ' Eddy , who was holding the arms of the chair to steady it , asked him . David nodded . Eddy put his hand on the top of the boy 's head and felt his cap . ' Cap 's still wet , ' he said . ' You 're giving him hell , Davy . Just like a machine . ' ' It 's easier now than holding him , ' David said , his voice still dry . ' Sure , ' Eddy told him . ' Something gives now . Other way it was just pulling your back out by the roots . '  |p108'Do  n't work him any faster than you can , ' Roger said . ' You 're doing wonderfully , Dave . ' ' Will we gaff him when he comes up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth off of him , please , ' David said . ' I was n't trying to mouth him . ' ' Oh just shut up , Andy , please . I 'm sorry . ' Andrew came climbing up topside . He had on one of the longpeakedcaps but under it his father could see his eyes were wet and the boy turned his head away because his lips trembled . ' You did n't say anything bad , ' Thomas Hudson told him . Andrew spoke with his head turned away . ' Now if he loses him he 'll think I mouthed him , ' he said bitterly . ' All I wanted to do was help get everything ready . ' ' It 's natural for Dave to be nervous , ' his father told him . ' He 's trying to be polite . ' ' I know it , ' Andrew said . ' He 's fighting him just as good as Mr Davis could . I just felt bad he could think that . ' ' Lots of people are irritable with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . ' ' You 're always polite and Mr Davis is always polite . ' ' We did n't use to be . When we were learning to fish big fish together we used to be excited and rude and sarcastic . We both used to be terrible . ' ' Truly ? ' ' Sure . Truly . We used to suffer and act as though everybody was against us . That 's the natural way to be . The other 's disciplineor good sense when you learn . We started to be polite because we found we could n't catch big fish being rude and excited . And if we did , it was n't any fun . We were both really awful though ; excited and sore and misunderstood and it was n't any fun . So now we always fight them politely . We talked it over and decided we 'd be polite no matter what . ' ' I 'll be polite , ' Andrew said . ' But it 's hard sometimes with Dave . Papa , do you think he can really get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? ' ' Let 's not talk about it . ' ' Have I said something wrong again ? ' ' No . Only it always seems bad luck to talk that way . We got it from the old fishermen . I do n't know what started it . '  |p109'I  'll be careful . ' Here 's your drink , papa , ' Tom said , handing it up from below . The glass was wrapped in a triple thickness of paper towel with a rubber band around to hold the paper tight against the glass and keep the ice from melting . ' I put lime , bitters , and no sugar in it . Is that how you want it ? Or can I change it ? ' That 's fine . Did you make it with coconut water ? ' ' Yes , and I made Eddy a whisky . Mr Davis did n't want anything . Are you staying up there , Andy ? ' ' No . I 'm coming down . ' Tom climbed up and Andrew went down . Looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slant up in the water . ' Watch it , Roger , ' he called . ' It looks like he 's coming up . ' ' He 's coming up ! ' Eddy yelled . He had seen the slant in the line too . Watch your wheel . ' Thomas Hudson looked down at the spool of the reel to see how much line there was to manoeuvre with . It was not yet a quarter full and as he watched it started to whiz off and Thomas I Judson started backing , turning sharp towards the slant of the line , well under way as Eddy yelled , Back on him , Tom . The son of a bitch is coming up . We ai n't got no line to turn . ' ' Keep your rod up , ' Roger said to David . ' Do n't let him get it down . ' Then to Thomas Hudson , Back on him all you can , Tom . You 're going right . Give her all she 'll take . ' Then , astern of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean broke open and the great fish rose out of it , rising , shining ( lark blue and silver , seeming to come endlessly out of the water , unbelievable as his length and bulk rose out of the sea into the air and seemed to hang there until he fell with a splash that drove the water up high and white . ' Oh God , ' David said . ' Did you see him ? ' ' His sword 's as long as I am , ' Andrew said in awe . ' He 's so beautiful , ' Tom said . He 's much better than the one I had in the dream . ' ' Keep backing on him , ' Roger said to Thomas Hudson . Then to David , Try and get some line out of that belly . He came up from way down and there 's a big belly of line and you can get some of it . Thomas Hudson , backing fast on to the fish , had stopped thep110line going out and now David was lifting , lowering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reel in sweeps as fast as he could turn the reel handle . ' Slow her down , ' Roger said . We do n't want to get over him . ' ' Son of a bitch 'll weigh a thousand pounds , ' Eddy said . ' Get that easy line in , Davy boy . ' The ocean was flat and empty where he had jumped but the circle made where the water had been broken was still widening . ' Did you see the water he threw when he jumped , papa ? ' young Tom asked his father . ' It was like the whole sea bursting open . ' ' Did you see the way he seemed to climb up and up , Tom ? Did you ever see such a blue and that wonderful silver on him ? ' ' His sword is blue too , ' young Tom said . ' The whole back of it is blue . Will he really weigh a thousand pounds , Eddy ? ' he called down . ' I think he will . Nobody can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get all the line you can , Davy , now while it 's cheap , ' Roger told him . ' You 're getting it fine . ' The boy was working like a machine again , recovering line from the great bulge of line in the water and the boat was backingso slowly that the movement was barely perceptible . ' What will he do now , papa ? ' Tom asked his father . Thomas Hudson was watching the slant of the line in the water and thinkingit would be safer to go ahead just a little but he knew how Roger had suffered with so much line out . The fish had only needed to make one steady rush to strip all the line from the reel and break off and now Roger was taking chances to get a reserve of line . As Thomas Hudson watched the line , he saw that David had the reel nearly half full and that he was still gaining . ' What did you say ? ' Thomas Hudson asked his boy Tom . ' What do you think he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' his father said and called down to Roger . ' I 'm afraid we 're going to get over him , kid . ' ' Then put her ahead easy , ' Roger said . ' Ahead easy , ' Thomas Hudson repeated . David stopped getting in so much line but the fish was in a safer postion . Then the line started to go out again and Roger called up ,  |p111'Throw  her out , ' and Thomas Hudson threw out the clutches and let the motors idle . ' She 's out , ' he said . Roger was bending over David and the boy was braced and holding back on the rod and the line was slipping steadily away . ' Tighten on him a little bit , Davy , ' Roger said . ' We 'll make him work for it . ' ' I do n't want him to break , ' David said . But he tightened the drag . ' He wo n't break , ' Roger told him . ' Not with that drag . ' The line kept going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was braced back holding against the pressure with his bare feet against the wood of the stern . Then the line stopped going out . ' Now you can get some , ' Roger told the boy . ' He 's circling and this is the in-turn . Get back all you can . ' The boy lowered and reeled , then lifted ; let the rod straighten ; lowered and reeled . He was getting line beautifully again . ' Am I doing all right ? ' he asked . ' You 're doing wonderful , ' Eddy told him . ' He 's hooked deep , Davy . I could see when he jumped . ' Then , while the boy was lifting , the line started to go out again . ' Hell , ' David said . ' That 's OK , ' Roger told him . ' That 's what 's supposed to happen . He 's on the out-turn now . He circled in towards you and you got line . Now he 's taking it back . ' Steadily , slowly , with David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fish took out all the line the boy had just recovered and a little more . Then the boy held him . ' All right . Get to work on him , ' Roger said quietly . ' He widened his circle a little bit but he 's on the in-swing now . ' Thomas Hudson was using the engines only occasionally now to keep the fish astern . He was trying to do everything for the boy that the boat could do and he was trusting the boy and the fight to Roger . As he saw it there was no other thing to do . On the next circle the fish gained a little line again . On the circle after that he gained too . But the boy still had almost half the line on the reel . He was still working the fish exactly as he should and delivering each time Roger asked him to do some/thing . But he was getting very tired and the sweat and salt water had made salty blotches on his brown back and shoulders . ' Two hours even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head , Davy ? ' ' All right . ' ' Not ache ? ' The boy shook his head . ' You better drink some water this time , ' Eddy said . David nodded and drank when Andrew put the glass to his lips . ' How do you feel , Davy , really ? ' Roger asked him , bending close over him . ' Fine . All except my back and legs and arms . ' He shut his eyes for an instant and held to the bucking of the rod as the line went out against the heavy drag . ' I do n't want to talk , ' he said . ' You can get some on him now , ' Roger told him and the boy went back to work . ' David 's a saint and a martyr , ' Tom said to his father . ' Boys do n't have brothers like David . Do you mind if I talk , papa ? I 'm awfully nervous about this . ' ' Go ahead and talk , Tommy . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , ' Tom said . ' He 's not a damn genius nor an athlete like Andy . He 's just wonderful . I know you love him the most and that 's right because he 's the best of us and I know this must be good for him or you would n't let him do it . But it certainly makes me nervous . ' Thomas Hudson put an arm around his shoulder and steered , looking astern with only one hand on the wheel . ' The trouble is , Tommy , what it would do to him if we made him give it up . Roger and Eddy know everything about what they 're doing and I know they love him and would n't have him do what he ca n't do . ' ' But there is no limit with him , papa . Truly . He 'll always do what he ca n't do . ' ' You trust me and I 'll trust Roger and Eddy . ' ' All right . But I 'm going to pray for him now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Why did you say I loved him the best ? ' ' You ought to . '  |p113'I  've loved you the longest . ' ' Let 's not think about me nor you . Let 's both of us pray for Davy . ' ' Good , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' Now look . We hooked him right at noon . There 's going to be some shade now . I think we 've got some already . I 'm going to work her around very softly and put Davy in the shade . ' Thomas Hudson called down to Roger , ' If it 's OK with you , Roge , I 'd like to work her around slow and put Dave in the shade . I do n't think it will make any difference with the fish the way he 's circling and we 'll be on his real course . ' ' Fine , ' Roger said . ' I should have thought of it . ' There has n't been any shade until now , ' Thomas Hudson said . Ile worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stern , that they lost almost no line by the manoeuvre . David 's head and shoulders were now shaded by the aft part of the house . Eddy was wiping the boy 's neck and shoulders with a towel and putting alcohol on his back and on the back of his neck . ' How 's that , Dave ? ' young Tom called down to him . ' Wonderful , ' David said . ' I feel better about him now , ' young Tom said . ' You know at school somebody said David was my half brother , not my real brother , and I told him we did n't have half brothers in our family . I wish I did n't worry so much though , papa . ' ' You 'll get over it . ' ' In a family like ours somebody has to worry , ' young Tom said . ' But I never worry about you any more . It 's David now . I guess I better make a couple of more drinks . I can pray while I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'd love one . ' ' Fddy probably needs one pretty badly , ' the boy said . ' It must be nearly three hours . Eddy 's only had one drink in three hours . I 've certainly been remiss about things . Why do you suppose Mr Davis would n't take one , papa ? ' ' I did n't think he would take one while David was going through all that . ' ' Maybe he will now Dave 's in the shade . I 'll try him now anyway . Ile went below . ' I do n't think so , Tommy , ' Thomas Hudson heard Roger say.  |p114'You  have n't had one all day , Mr Davis , ' Tom urged . ' Thanks , Tommy , ' Roger said . ' You drink a bottle of beer for me . ' Then he called up to the wheel . ' Put her ahead a little easy , Tom . He 's coming better on this tack . ' ' Ahead a little easy , ' Thomas Hudson repeated . The fish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was headed now he was shortening the circle . It was the direction he wanted to move in . Now , too , it was easier to see the slant of the line . It was easier to see its true slant much deeper in the dark water with the sun behind the boat and Thomas Hudson felt safer steering with the fish . He thought how fortunate it was that the day was calm for he knew David could never have taken the punishment that he would have had if he were hooked to such a fish in even a moderate sea . Now that David was in the shade and the sea stayed calm he began to feel better about it all . ' Thanks , Tommy , ' he heard Eddy say and then the boy climbed up with his paper-wrapped glass and Thomas Hudson tasted , took a swallow and felt the cold that had the sharpness of the lime , the aromatic varnishy taste of the Angostura and the gin stiffening the lightness of the ice-cold coconut water . ' Is it all right , papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beer from the icebox that was perspiring cold drops in the sun . ' It 's excellent , ' his father told him . ' You put in plenty of gin too . ' ' I have to , ' young Tom said . ' Because the ice melts so fast . We ought to have some sort of insulated holders for the glasses so the ice would n't melt . I 'm going to work out something at school . I think I could make them out of cork blocks . Maybe I can make them for you for Christmas . ' ' Look at Dave now , ' his father said . David was working on the fish as though he had just started the fight . ' Look how sort of slab-sided he is , ' young Tom said . ' His chest and his back are all the same . He looks sort of like he was glued together . But he 's got the longest arm muscles you could ever see . They 're just as long on the back of his arms as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's certainly built strangely , papa . He 's a strange boy and he 's the best damn brother you can have . ' Down in the cockpit Eddy had drained his glass and was wip/ing David 's back with a towel again . Then he wiped his chest and his long arms . ' You all right , Davy ? ' David nodded . ' Listen , ' Eddy told him , ' I 've seen a grown man , strong , shoulderslike a bull , yellow-out and quit on half the work you 've put in on that fish already . ' David kept on working . ' Big man . Your Dad and Roger both know him . Trained for it . I ishing all the time . Hooked the biggest goddam fish a man ever hooked and yellowed out and quit on him just because he hurt . Fish made him hurt so he quit . You just keep it steady , Davy . ' David did not say anything . He was saving his breath and pumping , lowering , raising , and reeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a he , ' Eddy told him . ' If it was a she it would have quit long ago . It would have bust its insides or its heart or burst its roe . In this kind of fish the he is the strongest . In lots of other fish it 's the she that is strongest . But not with broadbill . He 's awfully strong , Davy . But you 'll get him . ' The line started to go out again and David shut his eyes a moment , braced his bare feet against the wood , hung back against the rod , and rested . ' That 's right , Davy , ' Eddy said . ' Only work when you 're working . He 's just circling . But the drag makes him work for it and it 's tiring him all the time . ' Eddy turned his head and looked below and Thomas Hudson knew from the way he squinted his eyes that he was looking at the big brass clock on the cabin wall . ' It 's five over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with him three hours and five minutes , Davy old boy . ' They were at the point where David should have started to gain line . But instead the line was going out steadily . ' I le 's sounding again , ' Roger said . ' Watch yourself , Davy . Can you see the line OK , Tom ? ' ' I can see it OK , ' Thomas Hudson told him . It was not yet at a very steep slant and he could see it a long way down in the water from the top of the house . ' Ile may want to go down to die , ' Thomas Hudson told his oldest boy , speaking very low . ' That would ruin Dave . '  |p116Young  Tom shook his head and bit his lips . ' Hold him all you can , Dave , ' Thomas Hudson heard Roger say . ' Tighten up on him and give it all it will take . ' The boy tightened up the drag almost to the breaking point of the rod and line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best he could , while the line went out and out and down and down . ' When you stop him this time I think you will have whipped him , ' Roger told David . ' Throw her out , Tom . ' ' She 's cut , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' But I think I could save a little backing . ' ' OK . Try it . ' ' Backing now , ' Thomas Hudson said . They saved a little line by backing but not much , and the line was getting terribly straight up and down . There was less on the reel now than at the worsttime before . ' You 'll have to get out on the stern , Davy , ' Roger said . ' You'llhave to loosen the drag up a little to get the butt out . ' David loosened the drag . ' Now get the butt into your butt rest . You hold him around the waist , Eddy . ' ' Oh God , papa , ' young Tom said . ' He 's taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees on the low stern now , the rod bent so that its tip was underwater , its butt in the leather socket of the butt rest that was strapped around his waist . Andrew was holdingon to David 's feet and Roger knelt beside him watching the line in the water and the little there was on the reel . He shook his head at Thomas Hudson . There was not twenty yards more on the reel and David was pulled down with half the rod underwater now . Then there wasjl barely fifteen yards on the reel . Now there was not ten yards . Then the line stopped going out . The boy was still bent far over the stern and most of the rod was in the water . But no line was going out . ' Get him back into the chair , Eddy . Easy . Easy . Easy , ' Roger said . ' When you can , I mean . He 's stopped him . ' Eddy helped David back into the fighting chair , holding him around the waist so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy overboard . Eddy eased him into the chair and Davidp117got the rod butt into the gimbel socket and braced with his feet and pulled back on the rod . The fish lifted a little . ' Only pull when you are going to get some line , ' Roger told David . ' Let him pull the rest of the time . Try and rest inside the action except when you are working on him . ' ' You 've got him , Davy , ' Eddy said . ' You 're getting it on him all the time . Just take it slow and easy and you 'll kill him . ' Thomas Hudson eased the boat a little forward to put the fish further astern . There was good shadow now over all the stern . I'he boat was working steadily further out to sea and no wind troubled the surface . ' Papa , ' young Tom said to his father . ' I was looking at his feet when I made the drinks . They 're bleeding . ' ' He 's chafed them pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put a pillow there ? A cushion for him to pull against ? ' ' Go down and ask Eddy , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' But do n't interruptDave . ' It was well into the fourth hour of the fight now . The boat was still working out to sea and David , with Roger holding the back of his chair now , was raising the fish steadily . David looked stronger now than he had an hour before but Thomas Hudson could see where his heels showed the blood that had run down from the soles of his feet . It looked varnished in the sun . ' How 's your feet , Davy ? ' Eddy asked . ' They do n't hurt , ' David said . ' What hurts is my hands and Arms and my back . ' ' I could put a cushion under them . ' David shook his head . ' I think they 'd stick , ' he said . They 're sticky . They do n't hurt . Really . ' Young Tom came up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms of his feet right off . He 's getting his hands bad too . He 's had blisters and now they 're all open . Gee , papa . I do n't know . ' ' It 's the same as if he had to paddle against a stiff current , ' Pommy . Or if he had to keep going up a mountain or stick with a horse after he was awfully tired . ' ' I know it . But just watching it and not doing it seems so sort of awful when it 's your brother . ' ' I know it , Tommy . But there is a time boys have to do thingsp118if they are ever going to be men . That 's where Dave is now . ' ' I know it . But when I see his feet and his hands I do n't know , papa . ' ' If you had the fish would you want Roger or me to take him away from you ? ' ' No . I 'd want to stay with him till I died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We have to think about how he feels , ' his father told him . ' And what 's important to him . ' ' I know , ' young Tom said hopelessly . ' But to me it 's just Davy . I wish the world was n't the way it is and that things did n't have to happen to brothers . ' ' I do too , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' You 're an awfully good boy , Tommy . But please know I would have stopped this long ago except that I know that if David catches this fish he 'll have something inside him for all his life and it will make everything else easier . ' Just then Eddy spoke . He had been looking behind him into the cabin again . ' Four hours even , Roger , ' he said . ' You better take some water , Davy . How do you feel ? ' ' Fine , ' David said . ' I know what I 'll do that is practical , ' young Tom said . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , papa ? ' ' No . I 'll skip this one , ' Thomas Hudson said . Young Tom went below and Thomas Hudson watched David working slowly , tiredly but steadily ; Roger bending over him and speaking to him in a low voice ; Eddy out on the stern watching the slant of the line in the water . Thomas Hudson tried to picture how it would be down where the swordfish was swimming . It was dark of course but probably the fish could see as a horse can see . It would be very cold . He wondered if the fish was alone or if there could be another fish swimming with him . They had seen no other fish but that did not prove this fish was alone . There might be another with him in the dark and the cold . Thomas Hudson wondered why the fish had stopped when he had gone so deep the last time . Did the fish reach his maximum possible depth the way a plane reached its ceiling ? Or had the pulling against the bend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p119and  the resistance of its friction in the water discouraged him so that now he swam quietly in the direction he wished to go ? Was he only rising a little , steadily , as David lifted on him ; rising docilely to ease the unpleasant tension that held him ? Thomas Hudson thought that was probably the way it was and that David might have great trouble with him yet if the fish was still strong . Young Tom had brought Eddy 's own bottle to him and Eddy had taken a long pull out of it and then asked Tom to put it in the bait box to keep it cool . ' And handy , ' he added . ' If I see Davy fight this fish much longer it will make a damned rummy out of me . ' I 'll bring it any time you want it , ' Andrew said . ' Do n't bring it when I want it , ' Eddy told him . ' Bring it when I ask for it . ' The oldest boy had come up with Thomas Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his eyes . Roger was holding the chair and watching the line . ' Now listen , Davy , ' Eddy told the boy , looking close into his face . ' Your hands and your feet do n't mean a damn thing . They hurt and they look bad but they are all right . That 's the way a fisherman 's hands and feet are supposed to get and next time they 'll be tougher . But is your bloody head all right ? ' ' Fine , ' David said . ' Then God bless you and stay with the son of a bitch because we are going to have him up here soon . ' ' Davy , ' Roger spoke to the boy . ' Do you want me to take him ? ' David shook his head . ' It would n't be quitting now , ' Roger said . ' It would just make sense . I could take him or your father would take him . ' ' Am I doing anything wrong ? ' David asked bitterly . ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quit on him ? ' ' He 's giving you an awful beating , Davy , ' Roger said . ' I do n't want him to hurt you . ' ' He 's the one has the hook in his goddamn mouth , ' David 's voice was unsteady . ' He is n't giving me a beating . I 'm giving him a heating . The son of a bitch . ' ' Say anything you want , Dave , ' Roger told him.  |p120'The  damn son of a bitch . The big son of a bitch . ' ' He 's crying , ' Andrew , who had come up topside and was standing with young Tom and his father , said . ' He 's talking that way to get rid of it . ' ' Shut up , horseman , ' young Tom said . ' I do n't care if he kills me , the big son of a bitch , ' David said . ' Oh hell . I do n't hate him . I love him . ' ' You shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save your wind . ' He looked at Roger and Roger lifted his shoulders to show he did not know . ' If I see you getting excited like that I 'll take him away from you , ' Eddy said . ' I 'm always excited , ' David said . ' Just because I never say itnobody knows . I 'm no worse now . It 's only the talking . ' ' Well you shut up now and take it easy , ' Eddy said . ' You staycalm and quiet and we 'll go with him for ever . ' ' I 'll stay with him , ' David said . ' I 'm sorry I called him the names . I do n't want to say anything against him . I think he 's the finest thing in the world . ' ' Andy , get me that bottle of pure alcohol , ' Eddy said . ' I 'm goingto loosen up his arms and shoulders and his legs , ' he said to Roger . ' I do n't want to use any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ' He looked into the cabin and said , ' Five and a half even , Roger . ' He turned to David , ' You do n't feel too heated up now , do you , Davy ? ' The boy shook his head . ' That straight-up-and-down sun in the middle of the day was what I was afraid of , ' Eddy said . ' Nothing going to happen to you now , Davy . Just take it easy and whip this old fish . We want to whip him before dark . ' David nodded . ' Papa , did you ever see a fish fight like this one ? ' young Tom asked . ' Yes , ' Thomas Hudson told him . ' Very many ? ' ' I do n't know , Tommy . There are some terrible fish in this Gulf . Then there are huge big fish that are easy to catch . ' ' Why are some easier ? ' ' I think because they get old and fat . Some I think are almostp121old enough to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to death . ' There had been no boats in sight for a long time and it was getting late in the afternoon and they were a long way out between the island and the great Isaacs light . ' Try him once more , Davy , ' Roger said . The boy bent his back , pulled back against his braced feet , and the rod , instead of staying solid , lifted slowly . ' You 've got him coming , ' Roger said . ' Get that line on and try him again . ' The boy lifted and again recovered line . ' He 's coming up , ' Roger told David . ' Keep on him steady and good . ' David went to work like a machine , or like a very tired boy performing as a machine . ' This is the time , ' Roger said . ' He 's really coming up . Put her ahead just a touch , Tom . We want to take him on the port side if we can . ' ' Ahead just a touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , ' Roger said . ' We want to bring him up easy where Eddy can gaff him and we can get a noose over him . I 'll handle the leader . Tommy , you come down here to handle the chair and see the line does n't foul on the rod when I take the leader . Keep the line clear all the time in case I have to turn him loose . Andy , you help Eddy with anything he asks for and give him the noose and the club when he asks for them . ' The fish was coming up steadily now and David was not breakingthe rhythm of his pumping . ' Tom , you better come down and take the wheel below , ' Roger called up. ' 1 was just coming down , ' Thomas Hudson told him . ' Sorry , ' he said . ' Davy , remember if he runs and I have to turn him loose keep your rod up and everything clear . Slack off your drag as soon as I take hold of the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' Do n't let her jam up now , Davy . ' Thomas Hudson swung down from the flying bridge into the cockpit and took the wheel and the controls there . It was not as easy to see into the water as it was on the flying bridge but it was handier in case of any emergency and communication was easier.  |p122It  was strange to be on the same level as the action after having looked down on it for so many hours , he thought . It was like moving down from a box seat on to the stage or to the ringside or close against the railing of the track . Everyone looked bigger and closer and they were all taller and not foreshortened . He could see David 's bloody hands and lacquered-looking oozingfeet and he saw the welts the harness had made across his back and the almost hopeless expression on his face as he turned his head at the last finish of a pull . He looked in the cabin and the brass clock showed that it was ten minutes to six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to it , and looking at it from the shade and from David 's bent rod , the white line slanted into the dark water and the rod lowered and rose steadily . Eddy knelt on the stern with the gaff in his sun-spotted freckled hands and looked down into the almost purple water trying to see the fish . Thomas Hudson noticed the rope hitches around the haft of the gaff and the rope made fast to the Samson post in the stern and then he looked again at David 's back , his outstretched legs , and his long arms holding the rod . ' Can you see him , Eddy ? ' Roger asked from where he was holding the chair . ' Not yet . Stay on him , Davy , steady and good . ' David kept on his same raising , lowering , and reeling ; the reel heavy with line now ; bringing in a sweep of line each time he swung it around . Once the fish held steady for a moment and the rod doubled towards the water and line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , ' David said . ' He might , ' Eddy said . You ca n't ever know . ' But then David lifted slowly , suffering against the weight and , after the first slow lift , the line started to come again as easily and steadily as before . ' He just held for a minute , ' Eddy said . His old felt hat on the back of his head , he was peering down into the clear , dark purple water . There he is , ' he said . Thomas Hudson slipped back quickly from the wheel to look over the stern . The fish showed , deep astern , looking tiny and foreshortened in the depth but in the small time Thomas Hudson looked at him he grew steadily in size . It was not as rapidly as ap123plane grows as it comes in towards you but it was as steady . Thomas Hudson put his arm on David 's shoulder and went back to the wheel . Then he heard Andrew say , ' Oh look at him , ' and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and well astern , showing brown now and grown greatly in length and bulk . ' Keep her just as she is , ' Roger said without looking back and Thomas Hudson answered , ' Just as she is . ' ' Oh God look at him , ' young Tom said . Now he was really huge , bigger than any swordfish Thomas Hudson had ever seen . All the great length of him was purple blue now instead of brown and he was swimming slowly and steadily in the same direction the boat was going ; astern of the boat and on David 's right . ' Keep him coming all the time , Davy , ' Roger said . ' He 's coming in just right . ' ' Go ahead just a touch , ' Roger said , watching the fish . ' Ahead just a touch , ' Thomas Hudson answered . ' Keep it spooled , ' Eddy told David . Thomas Hudson could see the swivel of the leader now out of water . ' Ahead just a little more , ' Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Thomas Hudson repeated . He was watching the fish and easing the stern on to the course that he was swimming . He could see the whole great purple length of him now , the great broad sword forward , the slicing dorsal fin set in his wide shoulders , and his huge tail that drove him almost without a motion . ' Just a touch more ahead , ' Roger said . ' Going ahead a touch more . ' David had the leader within reach now . ' Are you ready for him , Eddy ? ' Roger asked . ' Sure , ' Eddy said . ' Watch him , Tom , ' Roger said and leaned over and took hold of the cable leader . ' Slack off on your drag , ' he said to David and began slowly raising the fish , holding and lifting on the heavy cable to bring him within reach of the gaff . The fish was coming up looking as long and as broad as a big log in the water . David was watching him and glancing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fouled . For the first time in sixp124hours he had no strain on his back and his arms and legs and Thomas Hudson saw the muscles in his legs twitching and quivering . Eddy was bending over the side with the gaff and Roger was lifting slowly and steadily . ' He 'd go over a thousand , ' Eddy said . Then he said , very quietly , ' Roger , hook 's only holding by a thread . ' ' Can you reach him ? ' Roger asked . ' Not yet , ' Eddy said . ' Keep him coming easy , easy . ' Roger kept lifting on the wire cable and the great fish rose steadily towards the boat . ' It 's been cutting , ' Eddy said . ' It 's just holding by nothing . ' ' Can you reach him now ? ' Roger asked . His tone had not changed . ' Not quite yet , ' Eddy said as quietly . Roger was lifting as gently and as softly as he could . Then , from lifting , he straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two hands . ' No . No . No . Please God , no , ' young Tom said . Eddy lunged down into the water with the gaff and then went overboard to try to get the gaff into the fish if he could reach him . It was no good . The great fish hung there in the depth of water where he was like a huge dark purple bird and then settled slowly . They all watched him go down , getting smaller and smaller until he was out of sight . Eddy 's hat was floating on the calm sea and he was holding on to the gaff handle . The gaff was on the line that was fast to the Samson post in the stern . Roger put his arms around David and Thomas Hudson could see David 's shoulders shaking . But he left David to Roger . ' Get the ladder out for Eddy to come aboard , ' he said to young Tom . ' Take Davy 's rod , Andy . Unhook it . ' Roger lifted the boy out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starboard side of the cockpit and laid him down in it . Roger 's arms were around David and the boy lay flat on his face on the bunk . Eddy came on board soaked and dripping , and started to undress . Andrew fished out his hat with the gaff and Thomas Hudsonwent below to get Eddy a shirt and a pair of dungarees and a shirt and shorts for David . He was surprised that he had no feeling at all except pity and love for David . All other feeling had been drained out of him in the fight.  |p125When  he came up David was lying , naked , face-down on the hunk and Roger was rubbing him down with alcohol . ' It hurts across the shoulders and my tail , ' David said . ' Watch out , Mr Davis , please . ' ' It 's where it 's chafed , ' Eddy told him . ' Your father 's going to fix your hands and feet with Mercurochrome . That wo n't hurt . ' ' Get this shirt on , Davy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get cold . Go get one of the lightest blankets for him , Tom . ' Thomas Hudson touched the places where the harness had chafed the boy 's back with Mercurochrome and helped him into the shirt . ' I 'm all right , ' David said in a toneless voice . ' Can I have a Coke , papa ? ' Sure , ' Thomas Hudson told him . ' Eddy will get you some soup in a little while . ' ' I 'm not hungry , ' David said . ' I could n't eat yet . ' ' We 'll wait a while , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' I know how you feel , Dave , ' Andrew said when he brought the Coke . ' Nobody knows how I feel , ' David said . Thomas Hudson gave his oldest boy a compass course to steer back to the island . ' Synchronize your motors at three hundred , Tommy , ' he said . ' We 'll be in sight of the light by dark and then I 'll give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while will you please , papa . Do you feel as awful as I do ? ' ' There 's nothing to do about it . ' ' Eddy certainly tried , ' young Tom said . ' Not everybody would jump in this ocean after a fish . ' ' Eddy nearly made it , ' his father told him . ' It could have been a hell of a thing with him in the water with a gaff in that fish . ' ' Eddy would have got out all right , ' young Tom said . ' Are they synchronized all right ? ' ' Listen for it , ' his father told him . ' Do n't just watch the tacho-meters . ' Thomas Hudson went over to the bunk and sat down by David . He was rolled up in the light blanket and Eddy was fixing his hands and Roger his feet.  |p126'Hi  , papa , ' he said and looked at Thomas Hudson and then looked away . ' I 'm awfully sorry , Davy , ' his father said . ' You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roger or any man ever . ' ' Thank you very much , papa . Please do n't talk about it . ' ' Can I get you anything , Davy ? ' ' I 'd like another Coke , please , ' David said . Thomas Hudson found a cold bottle of Coca-Cola in the ice of the bait box and opened it . He sat by David and the boy drank the Coke with the hand Eddy had fixed . ' I 'll have some soup ready right away . It 's heating now , ' Eddy said . ' Should I heat some chile , Tom ? We 've got some conch salad . ' ' Let 's heat some chile , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' We have n't eaten since breakfast . Roger has n't had a drink all day . ' ' I had a bottle of beer just now , ' Roger said . ' Eddy , ' David said . ' What would he really weigh ? ' ' Over a thousand , ' Eddy told him . ' Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Thank you very much , Eddy . ' ' Hell , ' Eddy said . ' What else was there to do ? ' ' Would he really have weighed a thousand , papa ? ' David asked . ' I 'm sure of it , ' Thomas Hudson answered . ' I 've never seen a bigger fish , either broadbill or marlin , ever . ' The sun had gone down and the boat was driving through the calm sea , the boat alive with the engines , pushing fast through the same water they had moved so slowly through for all those hours . Andrew was sitting on the edge of the wide bunk now , too . ' Hello , horseman , ' David said to him . ' If you 'd have caught him , ' Andrew said , ' you 'd have been probably the most famous young boy in the world . ' ' I do n't want to be famous , ' David said . You can be famous . ' ' We 'd have been famous as your brothers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have been famous as your friend , ' Roger told him . ' I 'd have been famous because I steered , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' And Eddy because he gaffed him . ' ' Eddy ought to be famous anyway , ' Andrew said . ' Tommyp127would be famous because he brought so many drinks . All through the terrific battle Tommy kept them supplied . ' ' What about the fish ? Would n't he be famous ? ' David asked . He was all right , now . Or , at least , he was talking all right . ' He 'd be the most famous of all , ' Andrew said . ' He 'd be im-mortal . ' ' I hope nothing happened to him , ' David said . ' I hope he 's all right . ' ' I know he 's all right , ' Roger told him . ' The way he was hooked . uid the way he fought I know he was all right . ' ' I 'll tell you sometime how it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged him . ' I 'm tired now and besides it sounds crazy . ' ' Tell now . Tell a little bit , ' Andrew said . ' I do n't know whether I better . Should I , papa ? ' ' Go ahead , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Well , ' David said with his eyes tight shut . ' In the worst parts , when I was the tiredest I could n't tell which was him and which was me . ' ' I understand , ' Roger said . ' Then I began to love him more than anything on earth . ' ' You mean really love him ? ' Andrew asked . ' Yeah . Really love him . ' ' Gee , ' said Andrew . ' I ca n't understand that . ' ' I loved him so much when I saw him coming up that I could n't stand it , ' David said , his eyes still shut . ' All I wanted was to see him closer . ' ' I know , ' Roger said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , ' David said . ' I do n't care about records . I just thought I did . I 'm glad that he 's all right and that I 'm all right . We are n't enemies . ' ' I 'm glad you told us , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Thank you very much , Mr Davis , for what you said when I first lost him , ' David said with his eyes still shut . Thomas Hudson never knew what it was that Roger had said to him.  |p128THAT  night in the heavy calm before the wind rose Thomas Hudson sat in his chair and tried to read . The others were all in bed but he knew he could not sleep and he wanted to read until he was sleepy . He could not read and he thought about the day . He thought about it from the beginning until the end and it seemed as though all of his children except Tom had gone a long way away from him or he had gone away from them . David had gone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger , who was as beautiful and sound in action as he was unbeautiful and unsound in his life and in his work . David was always a mystery to Thomas Hudson . He was a well-loved mystery . But Roger understood him better than his own father did . He was happy they did understand each other so well but tonight he felt lonely in some way about it . Then he had not liked the way Andrew had behaved , although he knew Andrew was Andrew and a little boy and that it was unfair to judge him . He had done nothing bad and he had really behaved very well . But there was something about him that you could not trust . What a miserable , selfish way to be thinking about people that you love , he thought . Why do n't you remember the day and not analyse it and tear it to pieces ? Go to bed now , he told himself , and make yourself sleep . The hell with anything else . And pick up the rhythm of your life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . See how happy a time you can make for them . I 've tried , he said to himself . I 've tried truly and for Roger , too . And you have been very happy yourself , he told himself . Yes , of course . But something about today frightened me . Then he told himself : truly , there is something about every day to frighten you . Go on to bed and maybe you 'll sleep well . Rememberyou want them to be happy tomorrow . A big southwest wind came up in the night and by daylight it was slowing with almost the force of a gale . The palms were bent with it and shutters slammed and papers blew and a surf was piling on the beach.  |p129Roger  was gone when Thomas Hudson came down to breakfast alone . The boys were still sleeping and he read his mail that had come from the mainland on the run-boat that brought ice , meat , fresh vegetables , gas , and other supplies once a week . It was blowing so hard he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laid it down on the table . ' Want me to shut the doors ? ' Joseph asked . ' No . Only if things start to break . ' ' Mr Roger gone walking on the beach , ' Joseph said . ' Headed up towards the end of the island . ' Thomas Hudson kept on reading his mail . ' Here 's the paper , ' Joseph said . ' I ironed her out . ' ' Thank you , Joseph . ' ' Mister Tom , is it true about the fish ? What Eddy was telling me ? ' What did he say ? ' ' About how big he was and having him right up to the gaff . ' ' It 's true . ' ' God Almighty . If that run-boat had n't come so I had to stay in to carry ice and groceries I 'd have been along . I 'd have dove right in after him and gaffed him . ' ' Eddy dove in , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' He did n't tell me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more coffee , please , Joseph , and another piece of papaw , ' Thomas Hudson said . He was hungry and the wind gave him even more appetite . ' Did n't the run-boat bring any bacon ? ' ' I believe I can find some , ' Joseph said . ' You 're eating good this morning . ' ' Ask Eddy to come in please . ' ' Eddy went home to fix his eye . ' ' What happened to his eye ? ' ' Somebody balled their fist in it . ' Thomas Hudson believed he knew why this might have happened . ' Is he hurt anywhere else ? ' ' He 's beat pretty bad , ' Joseph said . ' On account of people not believing him in different bars . People ai n't never going to believe him that story he tells . Certainly is a pity . ' ' Where 'd he fight ? '  |p130'Everywhere  . Everywhere where they would n't believe him . Nobody believe him yet . People took to not believing him late at night that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fight . He must have fought all the fighting men on the island . Tonight , sure as you eating breakfast , men 'll come up from Middle Key just to doubt his word . Couple real bad fighting men down at Middle Key now on that construction . ' ' Mr Roger better go out with him , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Oh boy , ' Joseph 's face lighted up . ' Tonight 's the night we got fun . ' Thomas Hudson drank the coffee and ate the cold papaw with fresh lime squeezed over it and four more strips of bacon that Joseph brought in . ' I see you were in an eating mood , ' Joseph said . ' When I see you like that , I want to make something out of it . ' ' I eat plenty . ' ' Sometimes , ' Joseph said . He came in with another cup of coffee and Thomas Hudson took it up to his desk to answer the two letters he needed to get off in the mail boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make out the list of what we need to order by the run-boat , ' he said to Joseph . ' Then bring it to me to check . Is there coffee for Mr Roger ? ' ' He had his , ' Joseph said . Thomas Hudson finished the two letters at the work desk upstairs and Eddy came over with the list of supplies for the next week 's run-boat . Eddy looked bad enough . His eye had not responded to treatment and his mouth and cheeks were swollen . One ear was swollen , too . He had put Mercurochrome on his mouth where it was cut and the bright colour made him look very untragic . ' I did n't do any good last night , ' he said . ' I think everything is on here , Tom . ' ' Why do n't you lay off today and go home and take it easy ? ' ' I feel worse at home , ' he said . ' I 'll go to bed early tonight . ' ' Do n't get in any more fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't do any good . ' ' You 're talking to the right man , ' Eddy said through the scarlet of his split and swollen lips . ' I kept waiting for truth and right top131win and then somebody new would knock truth and right right on its ass . ' ' Joseph said you had a lot of them . ' ' Till somebody took me home , ' Eddy said . ' Big-hearted Benny I guess it was . He and Constable probably saved me from getting hurt . ' ' You are n't hurt ? ' ' I hurt but I ai n't hurt . Hell , you ought to have been there , Tom . ' ' I 'm glad I was n't . Did anybody try to really hurt you ? ' ' I do n't think so . They were just proving to me I was wrong . Constable believed me . ' ' Did he ? ' ' Yes sir . Him and Bobby . Only people believed me , all right . Constable said any man who hit me first he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was anybody hit me first . I told him yes but I hit at them first . It was a bad night for truth and right , Tom . Bad night all right . ' ' Do you really want to cook lunch ? ' ' Why not ? ' Eddy said . ' We 've got steaks on the run-boat . Real sirloin steak . You ought to see her . I figured to have it with mashed potatoes and gravy and some lima beans . We got that cabbage lettuce and fresh grapefruit for a salad . The boys would like a pie and we got canned loganberries makes a hell of a pie . We got ice cream from the run-boat to put on top of it . How 's that ? I want to feed that goddamn David up . ' ' What did you figure to do when you dove overboard with the gaff ? ' ' I was going to get the gaff hook into him right underneath his fin where it would kill him when he came taut on the rope and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' What did he look like underwater ? ' ' He was as wide as a dinghy , Tom . All purple and his eye looked as big as your hand is long . It was black and he was silver underneath and his sword was terrible to see . He just kept on going down , settling slow , and I could n't get down to him becausethat big haft on the gaff was too buoyant . I could n't sink with it . So it was n't any use . ' ' Did he look at you ? '  |p132'I  could n't tell . He just looked like he was there and nothing made any difference to him . ' ' Do you think he was tired ? ' ' I think he was through . I think he 'd decided to give up . ' ' We 'll never see anything like that again . ' ' No . Not in our lifetimes . And I know enough now not to try to make people believe it . ' ' I 'm going to paint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just like it was then . Do n't make it comic like some of those comic ones you paint . ' ' I 'm going to paint it truer than a photograph . ' ' That 's the way I like it when you paint . ' ' It 's going to be awfully hard to paint the underwater part . ' ' Will it be like that waterspout picture down at Bobby 's ? ' ' No . This will be different but I hope it will be better . I 'm goingto make sketches for it today . ' ' I like that waterspout picture , ' Eddy said . ' Bobby , he 's crazy about it and he can make anybody believe there was that many waterspouts that time when they see the picture . But this will be a hell of a one to paint with the fish in the water . ' ' I think I can do it , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' You could n't paint him jumping , too , could you ? ' ' I think I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom . Paint him jumping and then with Roger bringing him up on the leader and Davy in the chair and me on the stern . We can get photographs took of it . ' ' I 'll start the sketches . ' ' Anything you want to ask me , ' Eddy said . ' I 'll be in the kitchen . The boys still asleep ? ' ' All three of them . ' ' Hell , ' Eddy said . ' I do n't give a damn about anything since that fish . But we 've got to have a good meal . ' ' I wish I had a leech for that eye . ' ' Hell , I do n't give a damn about the eye . I can see out of it fine . ' ' I 'm going to let the boys sleep as long as they can . ' ' Joe , he 'll tell me when they 're up and I 'll give them breakfast . If they wake up too late , I wo n't give them too much so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of meat we got ? ' ' No. '  |p133'Goddamn  she sure costs money but it 's beautiful meat , Tom . Nobody on this island has eaten meat like that in their whole lives . I wonder what those beef cattle look like that meat comes from . ' ' They 're built right down close to the ground , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' And they 're almost as wide as they are long . ' ' God , they must be fat , ' Eddy said . ' I 'd like to see them alive sometime . Here nobody ever butchers a cow till just before it 's going to die from starving . The meat 's bitter . People here 'd go crazy with meat like that we got . They would n't know what it was . Probably make them sick . ' ' I have to finish these letters , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' I 'm sorry , Tom . ' After he finished the mail , answering two other business letters that he had intended to put off until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's needs and writing a cheque for the week 's supplies plus the flat ten per cent the government charged on all imports from the Mainland , Thomas Hudson walked down to the run-boat that was loading at the government wharf . The captain was taking orders from the islanders for supplies , dry goods , medicines , hardware , spare parts , and all the things that came into the island from the Mainland . The run-boat was loadinglive crawfish and conches and a deck load of conch shells and empty gasoline and Diesel oil drums and the islanders stood in line in the heavy wind waiting their turn in the cabin . ' Was everything all right , Tom ? ' Captain Ralph called out the cabin window to Thomas Hudson . ' Hey , get back out of this cabin , you boy , and come in your turn , ' he said to a big Negro in a straw hat . ' I had to substitute on a few things . How was the meat ? ' ' Eddy says it 's wonderful . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blowing a gale outside . I want to get out over the bar on this next tide . Sorry I 'm so busy . ' ' See you next week , Ralph . Do n't let me hold you up . Thanks very much , boy . ' ' I 'll try to have everything next week . Need any money ? ' ' No . I 'm all right from last week . ' ' Got plenty of it here if you want it . OK . Now , you , Lucius , what 's your trouble ? What you spending money on now ? '  |p134Thomas  Hudson walked back along the dock where the Negroes were laughing at what the wind was doing to the girls ' and the women 's cotton dresses and then up the coral road to the Ponce de Leon . ' Tom , ' Mr Bobby said . ' Come in and sit down . By God where 've you been ? We 're just swept out and she 's officially open . Come on and have the best one of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense . That 's good imported beer . We got Dog 's Head ale too . ' He reached into a tub of ice , opened a bottle of Pilsner , and handed it to Thomas Hudson . ' You do n't want a glass , do you ? Put that down and then decide if you want a drink or not . ' ' I wo n't work then . ' ' Who gives a damn ? You work too much as it is . You got a duty to yourself , Tom . Your one and only life . You ca n't just paint all the time . ' ' We were in the boat yesterday and I did n't work . ' Thomas Hudson was looking at the big canvas of the waterspoutsthat hung on the wall at the end of the bar . It was a good painting , Thomas Hudson thought . As good as he could do as of today , he thought . ' I got to hang her higher , ' Bobby said . ' Some gentleman got excited last night and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost him ten thousand dollars if he put his foot through her . Constable told him the same . Constable 's got an idea for one he wants you to paint to hang in his home . ' What is it ? ' ' Constable would n't say . Just that he had a very valuable idea he had intention to discuss with you . ' Thomas Hudson was looking at the canvas closely . It showed certain signs of wear . ' By God , she sure stands up , ' Bobby said proudly . ' The other night a gentleman let out a shout and threw a full mug of beer at the column of one of the waterspouts trying to break it down . You would n't have known she 'd ever been hit . Never dented her . Beer run off her like water . By God , Tom , you sure painted her solid . ' ' She 'll only take about so much though . ' ' By God , ' said Bobby . ' I ai n't seen nothing faze her yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That gentleman last night worried me . ' He handed Thomas Hudson another bottle of the ice-cold Pilsner . ' Tom , I want to tell you how sorry I am about the fish . I know Eddy since we were boys and I never heard him lie . About anythingimportant , I mean . I mean if you asked him to tell you something true . ' ' It was a hell of a thing . I 'm not going to tell anybody about it. , ' That 's the right way , ' Bobby said . ' I just wanted you to know how sorry I was . Why do n't you finish that beer and have a drink ? We do n't want to start feeling sad this early . What would make you feel good ? ' ' I feel good enough . I 'm going to work this afternoon and I do n't want to get logy . ' ' Oh well , if I ca n't break you out maybe somebody will come in that I can . Look at that damn yacht . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft . ' Thomas Hudson looked out the open door and saw the handsome , white , houseboat type craft coming up the channel . She was one of the type that chartered out of a Mainland port to go down through the Florida Keys and on a day such as yesterday , calm and flat , she could have crossed the Gulf Stream without incident . But today she must have taken a beating with her shallowdraft and so much superstructure . Thomas Hudson wondered that she had been able to come in over the bar with the sea that was running . The houseboat ran up the harbour a little further to anchor and Thomas Hudson and Bobby watched her from the doorway , all white and brass and everyone that showed on her in whites . ' Customers , ' Mr Bobby said . ' Hope they 're nice people . We have n't had a full-sized yacht in here since the tuna run was over . ' ' Who is she ? ' ' 1 never seen her before . Pretty boat , all right . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She probably left at midnight when it was calm and this hit her on the way over . ' ' ' That 's about it , ' Bobby said . ' Must have been some rolling andp136some crashing . It 's really blowing . Well , we 'll see who they are shortly . Tom , let me make you something , boy . You make me nervous not drinking . ' ' All right . I 'll have a gin and tonic . ' ' No tonic water . Joe took the last case up to the house . ' ' A whisky sour then . ' ' With Irish whisky and no sugar , ' Bobby said . ' Three of them . Here comes Roger . ' Thomas Hudson saw him through the open door . Roger came in . He was barefooted , wore a faded pair of dungarees , and an old striped fisherman 's shirt that was shrunken from washings . You could see the back muscles move under it as he leaned forward and put his arms on the bar . In the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his hair was salt- and sunstreaked . ' They 're still sleeping , ' he said to Thomas Hudson . ' Somebody beat up Eddy . Did you see ? ' ' He was having fights all last night , ' Bobby told him . ' They did n't amount to anything . ' ' I do n't like things to happen to Eddy , ' Roger said . ' Was n't anything bad , Roger , ' Bobby assured him . ' He was drinking and fighting people who would n't believe him . Nobody did anything wrong to him . ' ' I feel bad about David , ' Roger said to Thomas Hudson . ' We should n't have ever let him do it . ' ' He 's probably all right , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' He was sleeping well . But it was my responsibility . I was the one to call it off . ' ' No . You trusted me . ' ' The father has the responsibility , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' And I turned it over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything to delegate . ' ' But I took it , ' Roger said . ' I did n't think it was harming him . Neither did Eddy . ' ' I know , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' I did n't think it was either . I thought something else was at stake . ' ' So did I , ' Roger said . ' But now I feel selfish and guilty as hell . ' ' I 'm his father , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' It was my fault . ' ' Damn bad thing about that fish , ' Bobby said , handing them thewhisky sours and taking one himself . ' Let 's drink to a bigger one . ' ' No , ' Roger said . ' I do n't want to ever see a bigger one . '  |p137'What  's the matter with you , Roger ? ' Bobby asked . ' Nothing , ' Roger said . ' I 'm going to paint a couple of pictures of him for David . ' ' That 's wonderful . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . I can see it and I think I know how to do it . ' You can do it all right . You can do anything . I wonder who 's on the yacht ? ' ' Look , Roger , you 've been walking your remorse all over the island  --  ' ' Barefooted , ' he said . ' I just brought mine down here by way of Captain Ralph 's run-boat . ' ' I could n't walk mine out and I 'm certainly not going to try to drink it out , ' Roger said . ' This is a mighty nice drink though , Bobby . ' ' Yes sir , ' Bobby said . ' I 'll make you another one . Get that old remorse on the run . ' ' I had no business gambling with a kid , ' Roger said . ' Somebody else 's boy . ' ' It depends on what you were gambling for . ' ' No , it does n't . You should n't gamble with kids . ' ' I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a fish , either . ' ' Sure , ' Roger said . ' But it was the one you did n't need to do it to . The one you did n't need to ever let anything like that happen to. , ' He 'll be fine when he wakes up . You 'll see . He 's a very intact boy . ' He 's my goddamned hero , ' Roger said . ' That 's a damned sight better than when you used to be your own goddamned hero . ' ' Is n't it ? ' Roger said . ' He 's yours , too . ' ' I know it , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' He 's good for both of us . ' ' Roger , ' Mr Bobby said . ' Are you and Tom any sort of kin ? ' ' Why ? ' ' I thought you were . You do n't look too different . ' ' Thanks , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Thank him yourself , Roger . ' ' Thank you very much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I look like this combination man and painter ? '  |p138'You  look like quarter brothers and the boys look like both of you . ' ' We 're no kin , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' We just used to live in the same town and make some of the same mistakes . ' ' Well , the hell with it , ' Mister Bobby said . ' Drink up and quit all this remorse talk . It do n't sound good this time of day in a bar . I got remorse from Negroes , mates on charter boats , cooks off yachts , millionaires and their wives , big rum runners , grocery store people , one-eyed men off turtle boats , sons of bitches , anybody . Do n't let 's have no morning remorse . A big wind is the time to drink . We 're through with remorse . That remorse is old stuff anyway . Since they got the radio everybody just listens to the BBC . There ai n't no time and no room for remorse . ' ' Do you listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben . The rest of it makes me restless . ' ' Bobby , ' Roger said . ' You 're a great and good man . ' ' Neither . But I 'm certainly pleased to see you looking more cheerful . ' ' I am , ' said Roger . ' What sort of people do you think we 'll get off that yacht ? ' ' Customers , ' said Bobby . ' Let 's drink one more so I 'll feel like serving them , however they are . ' While Bobby was squeezing the limes and making the drinks Roger said to Thomas Hudson , ' I did n't mean to be wet about Davy . ' ' You were n't . ' ' What I meant was . Oh hell , I 'll try to work it out simply . That was a sound crack you made about when I was my own hero . ' ' I 've got no business making cracks . ' ' You have as far as I 'm concerned . The trouble is there has n't been anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I try to make it simple all the time . ' ' You 're going to write straight and simple and good now . That 's the start . ' ' What if I 'm not straight and simple and good ? Do you think I can write that way ? ' ' Write how you are but make it straight . ' ' I 've got to try to understand it better , Tom . ' ' You are . Remember last time I saw you before this summer was in New York with that cigarette-butt bitch . '  |p139She  killed herself , ' Roger said . ' When ? ' While I was up in the hills . Before I went on to the Coast and wrote that picture . ' ' I 'm sorry , ' Thomas Hudson said . She was headed for it all the time , ' Roger said . ' I 'm glad I stepped out in time . ' ' You would n't ever do that . ' ' I do n't know , ' Roger said . ' I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do it is because it would be a hell of an example for the boys . How would Dave feel ? ' ' He 'd probably understand . Anyway when you get into that business that far you do n't think much about examples . ' ' Now you are talking wet . ' Bobby pushed over the drinks . Roger , you talk that kind of stuff you get even me depressed . I 'm paid to listen to anything people say . But I do n't want to hear my friends talk that way . Roger , you stop it . ' ' I 've stopped it . ' ' Good , ' Bobby said . Drink up . We had a gentleman here from New York lived down at the Inn and he used to come here and drink most of the day . All he used to talk about was how he was going to kill himself . Made everybody nervous half the winter . Constable warned him it was an illegal act . I tried to get Constableto warn him that talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get an opinion on that from Nassau . After a while people sort of got used to his project and then a lot of the drinkers started siding with him . Especially one day he was talking to Big Harry and he told Big Harry he was thinking of killing himself and he wanted to take somebody with him . ' " I 'm your man , " Big Harry told him . " I 'm who you 've been looking for . " So then Big Harry tries to encourage him that they should go to New York City and really pitch one and stay drunk until they could n't stand it and then jump off of the highest part of the city straight into oblivion . I think Big Harry figured oblivionwas some sort of a suburb . Probably an Irish neighbourhood . ' Well , the suicide gentleman took kindly to this idea and they 'd talk it over every day . Others tried to get in on it and proposed they form an excursion of death seekers and just go asp140far as Nassau for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City and finally he confided to the suicide gentleman that he could n't stand this life no longer and he was ready to go . Big Harry , he had to go out for a couple days crawfishing on a order he had from Captain Ralph and while he was gone the suicide gentleman took to drinking too much . Then he 'd take some kind of ammonia from up north that would seem to sober him up and he 'd come down to drink here again . But it was accumulating in him some way . We all called him Suicides by then so I said to him , " Suicides , you better lay off or you 'll never live to reach oblivion . " ' " I 'm bound for it now , " he says . " I 'm en route . I 'm headed for it . Take the money for these drinks . I 've made my dread decision . " ' " Here 's your change , " I said to him . ' " I do n't want no change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink before he joins me . " ' So he goes out in a rush and he dives off of Johnny Black 's dock into the channel with the tide going out and it 's dark and no moon and nobody sees him any more until he washes up on the point in two days . Everybody looked for him good that night , too . I figured he must have struck his head on some old concrete and went out with the tide . Big Harry come in and he mourned him until the change was all drunk up . It was change from a twenty-dollar bill too . Then Big Harry said to me , " You know , Bobby , I think old Suicides was crazy . " He was right , too , because when his family sent for him the man who came explained to Commissioner old Suicides had suffered from a thing called Mechanic 's Depressive . You never had that , did you , Roger ? ' ' No , ' said Roger . And now I think I never will . ' ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ever fool with that old oblivion stuff . ' ' Fuck oblivion , ' said Roger.  |p141LUNCH  was excellent . The steak was browned outside and striped by the grill . A knife slipped through the outer part and inside the meat was tender and juicy . They all dipped up juice from their plates and put it on the mashed potatoes and the juice made a lake in their creamy whiteness . The lima beans , cooked in butter , were firm ; the cabbage lettuce was crisp and cold and the grapefruit was chilly cold . Everyone was hungry with the wind and Eddy came up and looked in while they were eating . His face looked very bad and he said , ' What the hell you think of meat like that ? ' ' It 's wonderful , ' young Tom said . ' Chew it good , ' Eddy said . ' Do n't waste that eating it fast . ' ' You ca n't chew it much or it 's gone , ' young Tom told him . ' Have we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pie and ice cream . ' ' Oh boy , ' Andrew said . ' Two pieces ? ' ' Enough to founder you . Ice cream 's as hard as a rock . ' ' What kind of pie ? ' ' Loganberry pie . ' ' What kind of ice cream ? ' ' Coconut . ' ' Where 'd we get it ? ' ' Run-boat brought it . ' They drank iced tea with the meal and Roger and Thomas 1 Iudson had coffee after the dessert . ' Eddy 's a wonderful cook , ' Roger said . ' Some of it 's appetite . ' ' That steak was n't appetite . Nor that salad . Nor that pie . ' ' He is a fine cook , ' Thomas Hudson agreed . ' Is the coffee all right ? ' ' Excellent .

' ' I 'll put on Tom 's sneakers and walk , ' David said . ' Have you got it worked out , Tommy ? ' ' We can make it up as we go along , ' young Tom said . ' Can you still turn your eyelids inside out ? ' ' Oh sure , ' said David . ' Do n't do it now , please , ' Andrew said . ' I do n't want to be sick right after lunch .

What are yougoing to do , papa ? ' ' I 'm going to work in the lee out on the porch . ' ' I 'll lie out there on the cot and watch you work . Will you mind ? ' ' No . Make me work better . ' ' We 'll be back , ' Roger said . ' What about you , Andy ? ' ' I 'd like to come and study it . But I think I better not because the people might be there . ' ' That 's smart , ' young Tom said . ' You 're smart , horseman . ' They went off and Thomas Hudson worked all afternoon . Andy watched for a while and then went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas Hudson wanted to paint the leap of the fish first becausepainting him in the water was going to be much more difficult and he made two sketches , neither of which he liked , and finally a third one that he did like . ' Do you think that gets it , Davy ? ' ' Gee , papa , it looks wonderful . But water comes up with him when he comes out , does n't it ? I mean not just when he splashed back . '  |p143'It  must , ' his father agreed . Because he has to burst the sur-face . ' ' He came up so long . A lot must have come up . I suppose it really drips off him or pours off him if you could see it fast enough . Is he on his way up or on his way down ? ' This is just the sketch . I thought of him as just at the top . ' ' I know it 's just the sketch , papa . You forgive me if I butt in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I like you to tell me . ' You know who 'd know would be Eddy . He sees faster than a camera and he remembers . Do n't you think Eddy is a great man ? ' Of course he is . ' Practically nobody knows about Eddy . Tommy does , of course . I like Eddy better than anybody except you and Mr Davis . He cooks just like he loved it and he knows so much and can do anything . Look what he did with the shark and look how he went overboard yesterday after the fish . ' And last night people beating him up because they did n't believe him . ' But , papa , Eddy is n't tragic . ' ' No . He 's happy . ' ' Even today after he was all beaten up he was happy . And I 'm sure he was happy that he went in after him . ' ' Of course . ' ' I wish Mr Davis was happy the way Eddy is . ' ' Mr Davis is more complicated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can remember when he used to be careless happy . I know Mr Davis very well , papa . ' ' He 's pretty happy now . I know he 's lost the carelessness though . ' ' I did n't mean a bad carelessness . ' ' I did n't , either . But there is some sort of a sureness that he 's lost . ' ' I know it , ' David said . I wish he 'd find it . Maybe he 'll find it when he writes again . You see Eddy 's happy because he does something well and does it every day . ' ' I guess Mr Davis ca n't do his every day the way you do and Eddy does . '  |p144'No  . And there are other things . ' I know . I know too much for a kid , papa .

Tell me about some others that you did , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' We used to have some awful ones on trains . Trains are the best because of the sort of people I guess . You do n't get those sort of people concentrated almost anywhere except on trains . And then they ca n't get away . ' Thomas Hudson heard Roger talking in the other room and started to clean up and put away his gear . Young Tom came in and said , ' How are you , papa ? Did you work well ? May I see it ? ' Thomas Hudson showed him the two sketches and he said , ' I like them both . ' ' Do you like one better than the other ? ' David asked him . ' No . They 're both fine , ' he said . Thomas Hudson could see he was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is it coming ? ' David asked him . ' It 's terrific , ' young Tom said . ' It will be wonderful if we do it right . They 're all down there now and we 've been working on them all afternoon . We saw Mr Bobby and Constable before they came . The way it 's been so far is that Mr Davis is sodden and I 've been trying to dissuade him . ' ' You did n't overdo it ? ' ' Hell no , ' young Tom said . ' You ought to have seen Mr Davis . Every drink made a difference in him . But only imperceptibly . ' ' What was he drinking ? ' ' Tea . Bobby 's got it in a rum bottle . He 's got a gin bottle fixed with water for Andy . ' ' How did you try to dissuade Mr Davis ? ' ' I pled with him . But so they could n't hear me . Mr Bobby 's in it , too , but he 's using real liquor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' Before Mr Bobby gets too far ahead . How 's Mr Davis feeling ? ' ' Wonderful . He 's a great , great artist , Dave . ' ' Where 's Andy ? ' ' Downstairs practising part of it in front of a mirror . ' ' Is Eddy going to be in it ? '  |p146'Eddy  and Joseph are both going to be in it . ' ' They 'll never remember . ' ' They only have one line . ' ' Eddy can remember one line but I do n't know about Joseph . ' ' He just repeats it after Eddy . ' ' Is Constable in it ? ' ' Sure . ' ' How many of them are there ? ' ' Seven with two girls . One nice-looking and one wonderful . She 's sorry for Mr Davis already . ' ' Oh boy , ' said David . ' Let 's go . ' ' How 're you going to get down there ? ' young Tom asked David . ' I 'll carry him , ' Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear sneakers , ' David said . ' Let me wear Tommy 's sneakers . I 'll walk on the side of my feet and it wo n't hurt them and it will look good . ' ' All right . We might as well go . Where 's Roger ? ' ' He 's having a quick one with Eddy for his art , ' young Tom said . ' He was at bat a long time on that tea , papa . ' The wind was still blowing hard outside when they went into the Ponce de Leon . The people from the yacht were at the bar drinking rum swizzles . They were a nice-looking lot of people , tanned and dressed in whites , and they were polite and made room at the bar . Two men and a girl were at one end where the slot machine was and three men and the other girl were at the other end nearest the door . It was the lovely-looking girl who was at the slot machine end . But the other girl was awfully nicelooking , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in straight . David even tried not to limp . Mr Bobby looked at Roger and said , ' You back ? ' Roger nodded hopelessly and Bobby put the rum bottle and a glass on the bar in front of him . Roger reached for it and did n't say anything . ' You drinking , Hudson ? ' Bobby said to Thomas Hudson . His face was stern and righteous . Thomas Hudson nodded . ' You ought to cut it out , ' Bobby said . ' There 's a goddamn limit to everything . ' ' I just want a little rum , Bobby . ' ' That stuff he 's drinking ? ' ' No . Bacardi . '  |p147Mr  Bobby poured a glass and handed it to Thomas Hudson . ' Take it , ' he said . ' Though you know I should n't serve you . ' Thomas Hudson drank the glass at a gulp and it was warmingand inspiring . ' Give me another , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' In twenty minutes , Hudson , ' Bobby said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people were paying a little attention , but politely . ' What are you drinking , Sport ? ' Mr Bobby asked David . ' You know damn well I 'm off the stuff , ' David said to himseverely . ' Since when ? ' ' Since last night you know damn well . ' ' Excuse me , ' Mr Bobby said . He took a quick one himself . ' How the hell am I to keep track of you goddamn delinquents ? All I ask is you get that Hudson out of here when I 've got decent trade . ' ' I 'm drinking quietly , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' You better . ' Mr Bobby corked the bottle in front of Roger and put it back on the shelf . ' Young Tom nodded to him approvingly and whispered to Roger . Roger lowered his head on his hands . Then he raised his head and pointed to the bottle . Young Tom shook his head . Bobby picked up the bottle , uncorked it , and set it down in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . ' I wo n't lose any sleep . ' By now the two groups were watching this pretty closely ; but still politely . They were slumming all right but they were polite and they seemed nice people . Then Roger spoke for the first time . ' Give the little rat a drink , ' he said to Bobby . ' What will you have , son ? ' Mr. Bobby asked Andy . ' Gin , ' Andy said . Thomas Hudson was careful not to watch the people . But he could feel them . Bobby put the bottle in front of Andy and set a glass by it . Andy poured the glass full and lifted it to Bobby . ' Here 's to you , Mr Bobby , ' he said . ' The first one all day . ' ' Drink up , ' said Bobby . ' You come in late . '  |p148'Pa|pa  had his money , ' David said . ' His birthday money from mother . ' Young Tom looked up in his father 's face and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sad to see and it was not overdone . Nobody spoke until Andy said , ' I 'd like another gin , please , Mr Bobby . ' ' Pour your own , ' said Bobby . ' You poor unfortunate child . ' Then he turned to Thomas Hudson . ' Hudson , ' he said . ' Have another and get out . ' ' I can stay as long as I 'm quiet , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' If I know you , you wo n't be quiet for long , ' Bobby said , vindictively . Roger pointed towards the bottle and young Tom hung on to his sleeve . He 'd controlled his tears and he was being brave and good . ' Mr Davis , ' he said . ' You do n't have to . ' Roger did not say anything and Mr Bobby put the bottle in front of him again . ' Mr Davis , you have to write tonight , ' young Tom said . ' You know you promised to write tonight . ' ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him . ' But , Mr Davis , you did n't have to drink this much when you wrote The Storm . ' ' Why do n't you shut up ? ' Roger said to him . Young Tom was patient and brave and long-suffering . ' I will , Mr Davis . I only do it because you asked me to . Ca n't we go back to the house ? ' ' You 're a good kid , Tom , ' Roger said . ' But we 're staying here . ' ' For very long , Mr Davis ? ' ' To the goddamn end . ' ' I do n't think we need to , Mr Davis , ' young Tom said . ' Really I do n't . And you know if you get so you ca n't see you wo n't be able to write . ' ' I 'll dictate , ' Roger said . ' Like Milton . ' ' I know you dictate beautifully , ' young Tom said . ' But this morning when Miss Phelps tried to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm writing an opera , ' Roger said . ' I know you 'll write a wonderful opera , Mr Davis . But don'tp149you think we ought to finish the novel first ? You took a big advance on the novel . ' ' Finish it yourself , ' Roger said . ' You ought to know the plot by now. , ' I know the plot , Mr Davis , and it 's a lovely plot but it has that same girl in it that you had die in that other book and people may be confused . ' ' Dumas did the same thing . ' ' Do n't badger him , ' Thomas Hudson said to young Tom . ' How can he write if you badger him all the time ? ' ' Mr Davis , could n't you just get a really good secretary to write it for you ? I 've heard that novelists did that . ' ' No . Too expensive . ' ' Do you want me to help you , Roger ? ' Thomas Hudson asked . ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , ' young Tom said . ' Will you truly , papa ? ' ' I 'll paint it in a day , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Paint it upside down like Michelangelo , ' Roger said . ' Paint it big enough so King George can read it without his spectacles . ' ' Are you going to paint it , papa ? ' David asked . ' Yes . ' ' Good , ' David said . ' That 's the first sensible thing I 've heard . ' ' It wo n't be too difficult , papa ? ' ' Hell no . It 's probably too simple . Who 's the girl ? ' ' That girl Mr Davis always has . ' ' Paint her in half a day , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Paint her upside down , ' Roger said . ' Keep it clean , ' Thomas Hudson told him . ' Mister Bobby , may I have another slug ? ' Andy asked . ' How many have you had , son ? ' Bobby asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Bobby told him and handed him the bottle . ' Listen , Hudson , when are you going to get that picture out of here ? ' ' Have n't you had any offers on it ? ' ' No , ' Bobby said . ' And it clutters the place up . Besides it makes me goddamn nervous . I want it out of here . ' ' Pardon me , ' one of the men from the yacht spoke to Roger . ' Is that canvas for sale ? ' ' Who spoke to you ? ' Roger looked at him . ' No one , ' the man said . ' You 're Roger Davis , are n't you ? '  |p150You  're damn right I am . ' ' If your friend painted that canvas and it is for sale I 'd like to discuss the price with him , ' the man said turning . You 're Thomas Hudson , are n't you ? ' Hudson is the name . ' ' Is the canvas for sale ? ' No , ' Thomas Hudson told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartender said  --  ' ' He 's crazy , ' Thomas Hudson told him . He 's an awfully good fellow . But he 's crazy . ' ' Mr Bobby , may I please have another gin ? ' Andrew asked very politely . Certainly , my little man , ' Bobby said and served it . ' Do you know what they ought to do ? They ought to put your healthy charming face on the label of those gin bottles instead of that idiotic collection of berries . Hudson , why do n't you design a suitable label for a gin bottle that would reproduce the childish charm of young Andy 's face ? ' ' We could launch a brand , ' Roger said . ' They 've got Old Tom gin . Why should n't we put out Merry Andrew ? ' ' I 'll put up the money , ' said Bobby . ' We can make the gin here on the island . The little lads can bottle it and affix the labels . We can sell it wholesale and in detail . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' Like WilliamMorris . ' What would we make the gin from , Mr Bobby ? ' Andrew asked . From bonefish , ' Bobby said . ' And from conches . ' The yacht people did not look at Roger or Thomas Hudson nor at the boys now . They were watching Bobby and they looked worried . About that canvas , ' the one man said . What canvas are you referring to , my good man ? ' Bobby asked him , downing another quick one . ' The very big canvas with the three waterspouts and the man in a dinghy . ' Where ? ' asked Bobby . ' There , ' said the man . Begging your pardon , sir , I think you 've had enough . This is ap151respectable place . We do n't run to waterspouts and men in dinghys here . ' ' I mean the picture there . ' ' Do n't provoke me , sir . There 's no picture there . If there was a painting in here it would be above the bar where paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a proper shipshape manner . ' ' I mean that picture there . ' ' What picture where ? ' ' There . ' I 'd be happy to fix you a Bromo Seltzer , sir . Or call you a rickshaw , ' Bobby said . ' A rickshaw ? ' ' Yes . A goddamn rickshaw if you want it straight to your face . You 're a rickshaw . And you 've had enough . ' ' Mr Bobby ? ' Andy asked very politely . ' Do you think I 've had enough ? ' ' No , my dear boy . Of course not . Serve yourself . ' ' Thank you , Mr Bobby , ' Andy said . ' This is four . ' ' I wish it was a hundred , ' Bobby said . ' You 're the pride of my heart . ' ' What do you say we get out of here , Hal , ' one of the men said to the man who wanted to buy the picture . ' I 'd like to pick up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get it for a decent price . ' ' I 'd like to get out of here , ' the first man insisted . ' Fun 's fun and all that . But watching children drink is a little too much . ' ' Are you really serving that little boy gin ? ' the nice-looking blonde girl at the end of the bar towards the door asked Bobby . She was a tall girl with very fair hair and pleasant freckles . They were not redhead freckles but were the sort blondes get when they have skins that tan instead of burn . ' Yes ma'am . ' ' I think it 's shameful , ' the girl said . ' It 's disgusting and it 's shameful and it 's criminal . ' Roger avoided looking at the girl and Thomas Hudson kept his ry es down . ' What would you like him to drink , ma'am ? ' Bobby asked . ' Nothing . He should n't have anything to drink . ' ' I lardly seems fair , ' Bobby said.  |p152'What  do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison a child with alcohol ? ' ' See , papa ? ' young Tom said . ' I thought it was wrong for Andy to drink . ' ' He 's the only one of the three who drinks , ma'am . Since Sport here stopped it , ' Bobby tried to reason with her . ' Do you think it 's fair to deprive the only one in a family of three boys of what little pleasure he gets ? ' ' Fair ! ' the girl said . ' I think you 're a monster . And you 're another monster , ' she said to Roger . ' And you 're another monster , too , ' she said to Thomas Hudson . ' You 're all horrible and I hate you . ' There were tears in her eyes and she turned her back on the boys and Mr Bobby and said to the men with her , ' Wo n't any of you do anything about it ? ' ' I think it 's a joke , ' one of the men said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . Or like double talk . ' ' No , it 's not a joke . That dreadful man gives him gin . It 's horribleand it 's tragic . ' ' Mr Bobby ? ' Tom asked . ' Is five my limit ? ' ' For today , ' Bobby said . ' I would n't want you to do anything to shock the lady . ' ' Oh get me out of here , ' the girl said . ' I wo n't watch it . ' She started to cry and two of the men went out with her and Thomas Hudson and Roger and the boys all felt quite bad . The other girl , the really lovely-looking one , came over . She had a beautiful face and clear brown skin and tawny hair . She wore slacks but she was built wonderfully as far as Thomas Hudsoncould see and her hair was silky and it swung when she walked . He knew he had seen her before . ' It is n't really gin , is it ? ' she said to Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go out and tell her , ' she said . ' She really feels awfully badly . ' She went out the door and she smiled at them as she went out . She was a wonderful-looking girl . ' Now it 's over , papa , ' Andy said . ' Can we have Cokes ? ' ' I 'd like a beer , papa . If it would n't make that lady feel bad , ' young Tom said . ' I do n't think she 'd feel badly about a beer , ' Thomas Hudsonp153said . ' Can I buy you a drink ? ' he asked the man who wanted to buy the picture . ' I 'm sorry if we were too stupid . ' ' No . No , ' the man said . ' Very interesting . The whole thing was very interesting to me . Fascinating . I 've always been interested in writers and artists . Were you all improvising ? ' ' Yes , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' Now about that canvas  --  ' ' It belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I painted it for him as a present . I do n't think he wants to sell it . But it 's his and he can do whatever he likes with it . ' ' I want to keep her , ' Bobby said . ' Do n't offer me a lot of money for her because it would just make me feel bad . ' ' I would really like to have it . ' ' So would I , goddamn it , ' said Bobby . ' And I 've got it . ' ' But Mr Saunders . That is a valuable canvas to have in a place like this . ' Bobby was getting angry . ' Leave me alone , will you ? ' he said to the man . ' We were having a wonderful time . As good a time as I ever had and women have to cry and ball up everything . I know she meant right . But what the hell . Meant right gets you quicker than anything else . My old woman means right and does right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell with means right . Now you 're here and you think you can take my picture just because you want it . ' ' But , Mr Saunders , you said yourself you wanted the picture out of here and that it was for sale . ' ' That was all balls , ' Bobby said . ' That was when we were havingfun . ' ' Then the picture is not for sale . ' ' No . The picture is not for sale , rent , nor charter . ' ' Well , ' said the man . ' Here is my card in case it ever is for sale . ' ' That 's fine , ' said Bobby . ' Tom may have some up at his place he wants to sell . What about it , Tom ? ' ' I do n't think so , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' I 'd like to come up and see them , ' the man told him . ' I 'm not showing anything now , ' Thomas Hudson answered . ' I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd like it . '  |p154'Thank  you . Will you write it here ? ' The man had a fountain pen with him and he wrote the address on the back of one of his cards and gave another card to Thomas Hudson . Then the man thanked Thomas Hudson again and asked if he might offer him a drink . ' Can you give me any idea about the prices of the larger canvases ? ' ' No , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' But the dealer will be able to . ' ' I 'll see him as soon as I 'm back in town . This canvas is extremelyinteresting . ' ' Thank you , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' You 're quite sure it ca n't be sold . ' ' Jesus , ' Bobby said . ' Stop it , will you ? That 's my picture . I had the idea for it and Tom painted it for me . ' The man looked as though what he had thought of as ' the charades ' were beginning again so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be insistent  --  ' ' You 're just about as insistent as a goddamn loggerhead , ' Bobby told him . ' Come on . Have a drink on me and forget it . ' The boys were talking with Roger . ' It was pretty good while it lasted , was n't it , Mr Davis ? ' young Tom asked . ' I did n't overdo it too badly , did I ? ' ' It was fine , ' Roger said . ' Dave did n't have much though . ' ' I was just getting ready to be a monster , ' David said . ' You 'd have killed her , I think , ' young Tom said . ' She was hurt pretty badly already . Were you going to come up as a monster ? ' ' I had my eyelids inside out and all ready to come up , ' David told them . ' I was bent down fixing myself to come up when we stopped . ' ' It was bad luck she was such a nice woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it have any effect on me yet . I guess now we wo n't have any chance to do another one . ' ' Was n't Mr Bobby wonderful ? ' young Tom asked . ' Boy , you were swell , Mr Bobby . ' ' Sure was a pity to stop , ' Bobby said . ' And Constable had n't even come in yet . I was just beginning to get worked up . I know just how those great actors must feel . ' The girl came in through the door . As she came in , the windp155blew her sweater against her and blew her hair as she turned to Roger . She would n't come back . But it 's all right . She 's fine now . ' Will you have a drink with us ? ' Roger asked her . ' I 'd love to . ' Roger told her all of their names and she said that she was Audrey Bruce . Can I come up and see your pictures ? ' Of course , ' Thomas Hudson said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of persistence said . Are you her father ? ' Roger asked him . No . But I 'm a very old friend . ' ' You ca n't come , ' Roger said . You have to wait for Very Old Friends Day . Or get a card from the committee . ' Please do n't be rude to him , ' she said to Roger . ' I 'm afraid I have been . ' ' Do n't be anymore . ' Fine . ' Let 's be pleasant . ' Good. : ' I liked Tom 's line about that same girl that is in all your books . ' ' Did you really like it ? ' young Tom asked her . It is n't really accurate . I was teasing Mr Davis : ' I thought it was a little bit accurate . ' ' You come up to the house , ' Roger told her . ' Do I bring my friends ? ' No . ' ' None of them ? ' ' Do you want them very much ? ' ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I come up to the house ? ' ' Any time , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Do I stay for lunch ? ' ' Naturally , ' Roger said . ' This sounds like a splendid island , ' she said . ' I 'm so glad we 're all pleasant . ' ' David can show you how he was going to be a monster when we called it off , ' Andy said to her.  |p156'Oh  dear , ' she said . ' We 'll have absolutely everything . ' ' How long are you staying ? ' young Tom asked her . ' I do n't know . ' ' How long is the yacht staying ? ' Roger asked . ' I do n't know . ' ' What do you know ? ' Roger asked . ' I mean it pleasantly . ' ' Not very much . What about you ? ' ' I think you 're lovely , ' Roger said . ' Oh , ' she said . ' Thank you very much . ' ' Will you stay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might . ' ' Will you come up to the house now and have a drink instead of having it here ? ' Roger asked her . ' Let 's have one here , ' she said . ' It 's awfully nice here . ' THE next day the wind had dropped off and Roger and the boys were swimming on the beach and Thomas Hudson was on the upper porch working . Eddy had said he thought it would do David 's feet no harm to swim in the salt water if he put a new dressing on them afterwards . So they had all gone in and Thomas Hudson had looked down and watched them from time to time while he painted . He was wondering about Roger and the girl and that distracted him so he stopped thinking about it . He could not help thinking of how much the girl reminded him of young Tom 's mother when he had first met her . But so many girls had managed to look in such a way that they reminded him of her , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this girl in time and he was quite sure they would see much of her . That had been clear enough . Well , she was decorative and she seemed very nice . If she reminded him of Tommy 's mother , that was too damn bad . But there was nothing to do about it . He had been through that one enough times before . He kept on working . This picture would be good he knew . The next one , with the fish in the water , was going to be the really difficult one . Maybe I should have tried it first , he thought . No , it 's better to get thisp157one done . I can always work on the other one after they are gone . ' Let me carry you up , Davy , ' he heard Roger say . ' So you wo n't get dry sand in them . ' ' All right , ' David said . ' Let me get them both clean here in the ocean first . ' Roger carried him up the beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they passed under the porch on the way to the chair Thomas Hudson heard David ask , ' Do you think she 'll turn up , Mr Davis ? ' ' I do n't know , ' Roger said . ' I hope so . ' ' Do n't you think she 's beautiful , Mr Davis ? ' ' Lovely . ' ' She likes us I think . Mr Davis , what does a girl like that do ? ' ' I do n't know . I did n't ask her . ' ' Tommy 's in love with her . So is Andy . ' ' Are you ? ' ' I do n't know . I do n't get in love with people like they do . Anyway I want to see her some more . Mr Davis , she is n't a bitch , is she ? ' ' I do n't know . She does n't look like one . Why ? ' ' Tommy said he was in love with her but that she was probablyjust a bitch . Andy said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She does n't look like one , ' Roger told him . ' Mr Davis , are n't those men with her a strange quiet lot ? ' ' They certainly are . ' ' What do men like that do ? ' ' We 'll ask her when she comes . ' ' Do you think she 'll come ? ' ' Yes , ' Roger said . ' I would n't worry if I were you . ' ' It 's Tommy and Andy that are worried . I 'm in love with someone else . You know . I told you . ' ' I remember . This girl looks like her , too , ' Roger told him . ' Maybe she saw her in the cinema and tried to look like her , ' David said . Thomas Hudson went on working . Roger was dressing David 's feet when she came in sight walkingup the beach . She was barefooted and wore a bathing suit with a skirt of the same material over it and she carried a beach bag . Thomas Hudson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and as good as her breasts that he had seen under the sweater . Her arms were lovely and all of her was brown . She had no make-up on except for her lips158158 and she had a lovely mouth that he wanted to see with no lipstick on it . Hello , ' she said . ' Am I very late ? ' ' No , ' Roger told her . We 've been in but I 'm going in again . ' Roger had moved David 's chair out to the edge of the beach and Thomas Hudson watched her as she bent over David 's feet and saw the small upturning curls at the nape of her neck as the weight of her hair fell forward . The small curls were silvery in the sun against her brown skin . What happened to them ? ' she asked . The poor feet . ' I wore them off pulling on a fish , ' David told her . How big was he ? ' ' We do n't know . He pulled out . ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' David said . ' Nobody minds about him any more . ' Is it all right to swim with them ? ' Roger was touching the worn places with Mercurochrome . They looked good and clean but the flesh was a little puckered from the salt water . ' Eddy says it 's good for them . ' ' Who is Eddy ? ' ' He 's our cook . ' And is your cook your doctor , too ? ' ' He knows about things like that , ' David explained . ' Mr Davis said it was all right , too . ' ' Does Mr Davis say anything else ? ' she asked Roger . ' He 's glad to see you . ' ' That 's nice . Did you boys have a wild night ? ' Not very , ' Roger said . ' We had a poker game and afterwards I read and went to sleep . ' Who won in the poker game ? ' Andy and Eddy , ' David said . What did you do ? ' ' We played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . ' Yes . Did you ? ' ' Wonderfully , ' he said . ' Tommy is the only one of us who plays backgammon , ' Davidp159told the girl . It was taught him by a worthless man who turned out to be a fairy . ' Really ? What a sad story . ' The way Tommy tells it , it is n't so sad , ' David said . ' There was n't anything bad happened . ' ' I think fairies are all awfully sad , ' she said . ' Poor fairies . ' This was sort of funny though , ' David said . Because this worthless man that taught Tommy backgammon was explaining to Tommy what it meant to be a fairy and all about the Greeks and Damon and Pythias and David and Jonathan . You know , sort of like when they tell you about the fish and the roe and the milt and the bees fertilizing the pollen and all that at school and Tommy asked him if he 'd ever read a book by Gide . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one ? With Oscar Wilde in it . ' Si le grain ne meurt , ' Roger said . It 's a pretty dreadful book that Tommy took to read the boys in school . They could n't understand it in French , of course , but Tommy used to translate it . Lots of it is awfully dull but it gets pretty dreadful when Mr Gide gets to Africa . ' I 've read it , ' the girl said . ' Oh fine , ' David said . Then you know the sort of thing I mean . Well this man who 'd taught Tommy backgammon and turned out to be a fairy was awfully surprised when Tommy spoke about this book but he was sort of pleased because now he did n't have to go through all the part about the bees and flowers of that business and he said , " I 'm so glad you know , " or something like that and then Tommy said this to him exactly ; I memorized it : " Mr Edwards , I take only an academic interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me backgammon and I must bid you good day . " ' ' Tommy had wonderful manners then , ' David told her . ' He 'd just come from living in France with papa and he had wonderful manners . ' ' Did you live in France , too ? ' ' We all did at different times . But Tommy 's the only one whoremembers it properly . Tommy has the best memory anyway . Ile remembers truly , too . Did you ever live in France ? ' ' For a long time . ' ' Did you go to school there ? '  |p160'Yes  . Outside of Paris . ' ' Wait till you get with Tommy , ' David said . ' He knows Paris and outside of Paris the way I know the reef here or the flats . Probably I do n't know them even as well as Tommy knows Paris . ' She was sitting down now in the shade of the porch and she was sifting the white sand through her toes . ' Tell me about the reef and the flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I show them to you , ' David said . ' I 'll take you out in a skiff on the flats and we can go goggle-fishing if you like it . That 's the only way to know the reef . ' ' I 'd love to go . ' ' Who 's on the yacht ? ' Roger asked . ' People . You would n't like them . ' ' They seemed very nice . ' ' Do we have to talk that way ? ' ' No , ' Roger said . ' You met the man of persistence . He 's the richest and the dullest . Ca n't we just not talk about them ? They 're all good and wonderful and dull as hell . ' Young Tom came up with Andrew following him . They had been swimming far down the beach and when they had come out and seen the girl by David 's chair they had come running on the hard sand and Andrew had been left behind . He came up out of breath . ' You could have waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , Andy , ' young Tom said . Then he said , ' Good morning . We waited for you but then we went in . ' ' I 'm sorry I 'm late . ' ' You 're not late . We 're all going in again . ' ' I 'll stay out , ' David said . ' You all go in now . I 've been talking too much anyway . ' ' You do n't have to worry about undertow , ' young Tom told her . ' It 's a long gradual slope . ' ' What about sharks and barracuda ? ' ' Sharks only come in at night , ' Roger told her . ' Barracuda never bother you . They 'd only hit you if the water was roily or muddy . ' ' If they just saw a flash of something and did n't know what it was they might strike at it by mistake , ' David explained . ' Butp161they do n't bite people in clear water . There 's nearly always barracudaaround where we swim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand right alongside of you , ' young Tom said . ' They 're very curious . But they always go away . ' ' If you had fish , though , ' David told her , ' like goggle-fishing and the fish on a stringer or in a bag , they 'd go after the fish and they might hit you by accident because they 're so fast . ' ' Or if you were swimming in a bunch of mullet or a big school of sardines , ' young Tom said . ' They could hit you when they were slashing in after the school fish . ' ' You swim between Tom and me , ' Andy said . ' Nothing will bother you that way . ' The waves were breaking heavily on the beach and the sandpipersand Wilson plover ran twinklingly out on to the hard newwetsand as the water receded before the next wave broke . ' Do you think we ought to swim when it 's this rough and we ca n't see ? ' ' Oh , sure , ' David told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim . It 's probably too rough for a sting ray to lie in the sand anyway . ' ' Mr Davis and I will look after you , ' young Tom said . ' I 'll look after you , ' Andy said . ' If you bump into any fish in the surf they 're probably little pompanos , ' David said . ' They come in on the high tide to feed on the sand fleas . They 're awfully pretty in the water and they 're curious and friendly . ' ' It sounds a little like swimming in an aquarium , ' she said . ' Andy will teach you how to let the air out of your lungs tostay down deep , ' David told her . ' Tom will show you how not toget in trouble with morays . ' ' Do n't try to scare her , Dave , ' young Tom said . ' We 're not big kings of underwater like he is . But just because he 's a king of underwater , Miss Bruce  --  ' ' Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What were you saying , Tommy ? ' ' I do n't know , ' young Tom said . ' Let 's go in and swim . ' Thomas Hudson worked on for a while . Then he went down and sat by David and watched the four of them in the surf . Thep162girl was swimming without a cap and she swam and dove as sleek as a seal . She was as good a swimmer as Roger except for the difference in power . When they came in on to the beach and came walking towards the house on the hard sand , the girl 's hair was wet and went straight back from her forehead so there was nothing to trick the shape of her head and Thomas Hudson thought he had never seen a lovelier face nor a finer body . Except one , he thought . Except the one finest and loveliest . Do n't think about it , he told himself . Just look at this girl and be glad she 's here . ' How was it ? ' he asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But I did n't see any fish at all , ' she told David . ' You probably would n't in so much surf , ' David said . ' Unless you bumped into them . ' She was sitting on the sand with her hands clasped around her knees . Her hair hung , damp , to her shoulders and the two boys sat beside her . Roger lay on the sand in front of her with his foreheadon his folded arms . Thomas Hudson opened the screen door and went inside the house and then upstairs to the porch to work on the picture . He thought that was the best thing for him to do . Below on the sand , where Thomas Hudson no longer watched them , the girl was looking at Roger . ' Are you gloomy ? ' she asked him . ' No . ' ' Thoughtful ? ' ' A little maybe . I do n't know . ' ' On a day like this it 's nice not to think at all . ' ' All right . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves ? ' ' The waves are free . ' ' Do you want to go in again ? ' ' Later . ' ' Who taught you to swim ? ' Roger asked her . ' You did . ' Roger raised his head and looked at her . ' Do n't you remember the beach at Cap d'Antibes ? The littlebeach . Not Eden Roc . I used to watch you dive at Eden Roc . ' ' What the hell are you doing here and what 's your real name ? ' ' I came to see you , ' she said . ' And I suppose my name isAudrey Bruce . '  |p163'Should  we go , Mr Davis ? ' young Tom asked . Roger did not even answer him . ' What 's your real name ? ' ' I was Audrey Raeburn . ' ' And why did you come to see me ? ' ' Because I wanted to . Was it wrong ? ' ' I guess not , ' Roger said . ' Who said I was here ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . You'dhad a fight with him here . He said you were a beachcomber . ' ' Well it 's combed pretty neatly , ' Roger said looking out to sea . ' He said you were quite a few other things , too . None of themwere very complimentary . ' ' Who were you at Antibes with ? ' ' With mother and Dick Raeburn . Now do you remember ? ' Roger sat up and looked at her . Then he went over and put his arms around her and kissed her . ' I 'll be damned , ' he said . ' Was it all right to come ? ' she asked . ' You old brat , ' Roger said . ' Is it really you ? ' ' Do I have to prove it ? Could n't you just believe it ? ' ' I do n't remember any secret marks . ' ' Do you like me now ? ' ' I love you now .

' ' No , Andy . You , brat ? ' ' Yes . I 'd love one . ' ' Come on , Dave . ' ' No . I want to hear it . ' ' You are a bastard for a brother sometimes , ' young Tom said . ' Bring me one , too , ' David said . ' Go right ahead , Mr Davis , do n't mind me at all . ' ' I do n't mind you , Davy , ' the girl said . ' But where did you go and why are you Audrey Bruce ? '  |p164'It  's sort of complicated . ' ' I guess it was . ' ' Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him . ' ' I liked him . ' ' I pass , ' Roger said . ' But why the Audrey ? ' ' It 's my middle name . I took it because I did n't like mother 's . ' ' I did n't like mother . ' ' Neither did I. I liked Dick Raeburn and I liked Bill Bruce and I loved you and I loved Tom Hudson . He did n't recognize me either , did he ? ' ' I do n't know . He 's strange and he might not say . I know he thinks you look like Tommy 's mother . ' ' I wish I did . ' ' You do damned plenty enough . ' ' Truly you do , ' David said . ' That 's something I know about . I 'm sorry , Audrey . I ought to shut up and go away .

I used to pray for everyone . Everything used to break my heart . I used to do First Fridays for mother to give her the grace of a happy death . You do n't know how I prayed for you , Roger . ' ' I wish it would have done more good , ' Roger said . ' So do I , ' she said . ' You ca n't tell , Audrey . You never know when it may , ' David said . ' I do n't mean that Mr Davis needs to be prayed for . I just mean about prayer technically . ' ' Thanks , Dave , ' Roger said . ' What ever became of Bruce ? ' ' He died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember Dick Raeburn did . ' ' I imagine you do.  |p165'I  do . ' Young Tom and Andy came back with the bottles of CocaColaand Andy gave a cold bottle to the girl and one to David . ' Thank you , ' she said . ' It 's wonderful and cold . ' ' Audrey , ' young Tom said . ' I remember you now . You used to come to the studio with Mr Raeburn . You never talked at all . You and I and Papa and Mr Raeburn used to go to the different circusesand we used to go racing . But you were n't as beautiful then . ' ' Sure she was , ' Roger said . ' Ask your father . ' ' I 'm sorry about Mr Raeburn dying , ' young Tom said . ' I remember him dying very well . He was killed by a bobsled that rode high over a turn and went into the crowd . He 'd been very ill and papa and I went to visit him . Then he was better after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't have . We were n't there when he was killed . I 'm sorry if talking about it upsets you , Audrey . ' ' He was a nice man , ' Audrey said . ' It does n't upset me , Tommy . It was a long time ago . ' ' Did you know either of us boys ? ' Andy asked her . ' How could she , horseman ? We were n't born yet , ' David said . ' How was I to know ? ' Andy asked . ' I ca n't remember anything about France and I do n't think you remember much . ' ' I do n't pretend to . Tommy remembers France for all of us . Later on I 'll remember this island . And I can remember every picture papa ever painted that I 've seen . ' ' Can you remember the racing ones ? ' Audrey asked . ' Every one I 've seen . ' ' I was in some of them , ' Audrey said . At Longchamps and at Auteuil and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . ' ' I can remember the back of your head then , ' young Tom said . ' And your hair was down to your waist and I was two steps above you to see better . It was a hazy day the way it is in the fall when it 's blue smoky looking and we were in the upper stand right opposite the water jump and on our left was the bullfinch and the stone wall . The finish was on the side closer to us and the water jump was on the inner course of the track . I was always above and behind you to see better except when we were down at the track . ' ' I thought you were a funny little boy then . '  |p166I  guess I was . And you never talked . Maybe because I was so young . But was n't Auteuil a beautiful track though ? ' Wonderful . I was there last year . ' Maybe we can go this year , Tommy , ' David said . Did you use to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' No , ' Roger said . ' I was just her swimming teacher . ' You were my hero . ' Was n't papa ever your hero ? ' Andrew asked . Of course he was . But I could n't let him be my hero as much as I wanted because he was married . When he and Tommy 's mother were divorced I wrote him a letter . It was very powerful and I was ready to take Tommy 's mother 's place in any way I could . But I never sent it because he married Davy 's and Andy 's mother . ' ' Things are certainly complicated , ' young Tom said . Tell us some more about Paris , ' David said . We ought to learn all we can if we 're going there now . ' ' Do you remember when we 'd be down on the rail , Audrey , and how after the horses came over the last obstacle they would be coming straight down towards us and the way they would look coming bigger and bigger and the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ? ' And how cold it used to be and how we would get close to the big braziers to get warm and eat the sandwiches from the bar ? ' I loved it in the fall , ' young Tom said . ' We used to ride back home in a carriage , an open one , do you remember ? Out of the Bois and then along the river with it just getting dark and the burning leaves smell and the tugs towing barges on the river . ' Do you really remember it that well ? You were an awfully small boy . ' ' I remember every bridge on the river from Suresnes to Charenton , ' Tommy told her . You ca n't . ' ' I ca n't name them . But I 've got them in my head . ' ' I do n't believe you can remember them all . And part of the river 's ugly and many of the bridges are . ' I know it .

But he wanted to walk when he finished work and so we would walk until I got too tired and then get a bus back some way . After we had some money we used to take taxis or horsecabs . ' ' You must have had money when we were going to the races . ' ' I think we did that year , ' Tommy said . ' I ca n't remember that . Sometimes we had money and sometimes we did n't .

You and I can go and see all the arrondissements together . ' ' I 'll have to think it over , ' the girl said . ' Do you want me to make you a drink to help you decide ? ' David said . ' That 's what they always do in Mr Davis 's books . ' ' Do n't ply me with liquor . ' ' That 's an old white slaver 's trick , ' young Tom said .

' Yes . If it 's not too long before lunch . ' Roger got up to make them and young Tom came over and sat by her . Andrew was sitting at her feet . ' I do n't think you ought to take it , Audrey , ' he said . ' It 's the first step . Remember ce n'est que le premier pas qui conte. '  |p168U|p  on the porch Thomas Hudson kept on painting . He could not keep from hearing their talk but he had not looked down at them since they had come in from swimming . He was having a difficult time staying in the carapace of work that he had built for his protection and he thought , if I do n't work now I may lose it . Then he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gone . But he knew he must keep on working now or he would lose the security he had built for himself with work . I will do exactly as much as I would have done if they were not here , he thought . Then I will clear up and go down and the hell with thinking of Raeburn or of the old days or of anything . But as he worked he felt a loneliness coming into him already . It was next week when they would leave . Work , he told himself . Get it right and keep your habits because you are going to need them . When he had finished work and gone down to join them , Thomas Hudson was still thinking about the painting and he said ' Hi ' to the girl and then looked away from her . Then he looked back . ' I could n't help hearing it , ' he said . ' Or overhearing it . I 'm glad we 're old friends . ' ' So am I. Did you know ? ' ' Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you dry , Audrey ? ' ' I 'll change in the shower , ' she said . ' I have a shirt and the skirt to this . ' ' Tell Joseph and Eddy that we 're ready , ' Thomas Hudson said to young Tom .

' ' Do n't you think I could be any good for him ? ' ' You might . What he needs is to work well to save his soul . I do n't know anything about souls . But he misplaced his the first time he went out to the Coast . ' ' But he 's going to write a novel now . A great novel . ' ' Where did you hear that ? ' ' It was in one of the columns . Cholly Knickerbocker , I think . ' ' Oh , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you truly think I might be good for him ? ' ' You might . '  |p169'There  are some complications . ' ' There always are . ' ' Should I tell you now ? ' ' No , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' You better get dressed and comb your hair and get up there . He might meet some other woman while he was waiting . ' ' You were n't like this in the old days . I thought you were the kindest man I ever knew . ' ' I 'm awfully sorry , Audrey . And I 'm glad you 're here . ' ' We are old friends , are n't we ? ' ' Sure , ' he said . ' Change and fix yourself up and get up there . ' He looked away from the girl and she shut the door of the shower . He did not know what made him feel as he did . But the happiness of the summer began to drain out of him as when the tide changes on the flats and the ebb begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the sea and the line of beach and he noticed that the tide had changed and the shore birds were workingbusily well down the slope of new wet sand . The breakers were diminishing as they receded . He looked a long way up along the shore and then went into the house. 13THEY had a fine time the last few days . It was as good as any of the time before and there was no pre-going sadness . The yacht left and Audrey took a room over the Ponce de Leon . But she stayed at the house and slept on a cot on the sleeping porch at the far end of the house and used the guest room . She did not say anything about being in love with Roger . All Roger said to Thomas Hudson about her was , ' She 's married to some sort of a son of a bitch . ' ' You could n't expect her to wait all her life for you , could you ? ' ' At least he 's a son of a bitch . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nice side . ' ' he 's rich . ' ' That 's probably his nice side , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' They'rep170always married to some son of a bitch and he always has some tremendously nice side . ' ' All right , ' Roger said . ' Let 's not talk about it . ' ' You 're going to do the book , are n't you ? ' ' Sure . That 's what she wants me to do . ' ' Is that why you 're going to do it ? ' ' Shove it , Tom , ' Roger told him . ' Do you want to use the Cuba House ? It 's only a shack . But you 'd be away from people . ' ' No . I want to go West . ' ' The Coast ? ' ' No . Not the Coast . Could I stay at the ranch for a while ? ' ' There 's only the one cabin that 's on the far beach . I rented the rest . ' ' That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks on the beach and swam together and with the boys . The boys went bone-fishing and took Audrey bone-fishing and goggle-fishing on the reef . Thomas Hudsonworked hard and all the time he was working and the boys were out on the flats he had the good feeling that they would be home soon and they would be having supper or dinner together . He was worried when they were goggle-fishing but he knew Roger and Eddy would make them be careful . One time they all went trolling for a full day up to the furthest light at the end of the bank and had a wonderful day with bonito and dolphin and three big wahoo . He painted a canvas of a wahoo with hi : . strange flattened head and his stripes around his long speed-buift body for Andy , who had caught the biggest one . He painted him against a background of the big spider-legged lighthouse with the summer clouds and the green of the banks . Then one day the old Sikorsky amphibian circled the house once and then landed in the bay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinghy . Joseph sculled out in another dinghy with their bags . Young Tom said , ' Goodbye , papa . It certainly was a swell summer . ' David said , ' Goodbye , papa . It certainly was wonderful . Do n't worry about anything . We 'll be careful . ' Andrew said , ' Goodbye , papa . Thanks for a wonderful , wonderfulsummer and for the trip to Paris . ' They climbed up into the cockpit door and all waved from thep171door to Audrey , who was standing on the dock , and called , ' Goodbye ! Goodbye , Audrey . ' Roger was helping them up and they said , ' Goodbye , Mr Davis . Goodbye , papa . ' Then very loud and carrying over the water , ' Goodbye , Audrey ! ' Then the door closed and locked and they were faces through the small glass planes and then they were water-splashed faces as the old coffee mills revved up . Thomas Hudson pulled away from the rush of spray and the ancient , ugly plane taxied out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled once and straightened course , steady , ugly , and slow across the Gulf . Thomas Hudson knew Roger and Audrey would be leaving and as the run-boat was coming the next day he asked Roger when he was going . ' Tomorrow , old Tom , ' Roger said . ' With Wilson ? ' ' Yes . I asked him to come back . ' ' I just wanted to know about ordering on the run-boat . ' So the next day they left the same way . Thomas Hudson kissed the girl goodbye and she kissed him . She had cried when the boys left and she cried that day and held him close and hard . ' Take good care of him and take good care of you . ' ' I 'm going to try . You 've been awful good to us , Tom . ' ' Nonsense . ' ' I 'll write , ' Roger said . ' Is there anything you want me to do ut there ? ' ' Have fun . You might let me know how things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ' So they were gone , too , and Thomas Hudson stopped in at Bobby 's on the way home . ' Going to be goddamn lonely , ' Bobby said . ' Yes , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' It 's going to be goddamn lonely . '  |p172THOMAS  HUDSON was unhappy as soon as the boys were gone . But he thought that was normal lonesomeness for them and he just kept on working . The end of a man 's own world does not come as it does in one of the great paintings Mr Bobby had outlined . It comes with one of the island boys bringing a radio message up the road from the local post office and saying , ' Please sign on the detachable part of the envelope . We 're sorry , Mr Tom . ' He gave the boy a shilling . But the boy looked at it and put it down on the table . ' I do n't care for a tip , Mr Tom , ' the boy said and went out .

It was signedby the Paris branch of his New York bank . Eddy came out . He had heard about it from Joseph who had heard about it from one of the boys at the radio shack . Eddy sat down by him and said , ' Shit , Tom , how can such things happen ? ' ' I do n't know , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' I guess they hit something or something ran into them . ' ' I 'll bet Davy was n't driving , ' Eddy said . ' I 'll bet so too . But it does n't matter any more . ' Thomas Hudson looked out at the flatness of the blue sea and the darker blue of the Gulf . The sun was low and soon it would be behind the clouds . ' Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a chauffeur . What difference does it make ? ' ' Do you think it could have been Andy ? ' ' Could be . His mother might let him . ' ' He 's conceited enough , ' Eddy said.  |p173'He  was , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' I do n't think he 's conceited now. , The sun was going down and there were clouds in front of it . ' We 'll get a wire to Wilkinson on their next radio schedule to come over early and for him to call up and save me space on a plane to New York . ' What do you want me to do while you 're away ? ' Just look after things . I 'll leave you some cheques for each month . If there are any blows , get plenty of good help with the boat and the house . ' ' I 'll do everything , ' Eddy said .

' ' I do n't either , ' said Thomas Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the time being , ' Thomas Hudson said and for the first time he looked straight down the long and perfect perspective of the blankness ahead . ' You 'll make it all right , ' Eddy said . ' Sure . When did n't I ever make it ? ' ' You can stay in Paris a while and then go to the Cuba house and young Tom can keep you company . You can paint good over there and it will be like a change . ' ' Sure , ' said Thomas Hudson . ' You can travel and that 'll be good . Go on those big boats like I always wanted to go on . Travel on all of them . Let them take you anywhere they go . ' ' Sure . ' ' Shit , ' said Eddy . ' What the fuck they kill that Davy for ? ' ' Let 's leave it alone , Eddy , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' It 's way past things we know about . ' ' Fuck everything , ' Eddy said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll play it out the way we can , ' Thomas Hudson told him . But now he knew he did not have much interest in the game.  |p174On  the eastward crossing on the Ile de France Thomas Hudson learned that hell was not necessarily as it was described by Dante or any other of the great hell-describers , but could be a comfortable , pleasant , and well-loved ship taking you towards a country that you had always sailed for with anticipation . It had many circles and they were not fixed as in those of the great Florentine egotist . He had gone aboard the ship early , thinking of it , he now knew , as a refuge from the city where he had feared meeting people who would speak to him about what had happened . He thought that on the ship he could come to some terms with his sorrow , not knowing , yet , that there are no terms to be made with sorrow . It can be cured by death and it can be blunted or anaesthetized by various things . Time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cured by anything less than death , the chances are that it was not true sorrow . One of the things that blunts it temporarily through blunting everything else is drinking and another thing that can keep the mind away from it is work . Thomas Hudson knew about both these remedies . But he also knew the drinking would destroy the capacity for producing satisfying work and he had built his life on work for so long now that he kept that as the one thing that he must not lose . But since he knew he could not work now for some time he planned to drink and read and exercise until he was tired enough to sleep . He had slept on the plane . But he had not slept in New York . Now he was in his stateroom , which had a sitting room connected with it , and the porters had left his bags and the big package of magazines and newspapers he had bought . He had thought they would be the easiest thing to start with . He gave his ticket to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some ice . When they came , he took out a fifth of good Scotch from one of his bags and opened it and made himself a drink . Then he cut the string around the big bundle of magazines and papers and spread them on the table . The magazines looked freshp175and virginal compared with the way they looked when they arrived at the island . He took up The New Yorker . At the island he had always saved it for the evenings and it had been a long time since he had seen a New Yorker of the week of publication or one that had not been folded . He sat in the deep comfortable chair and drank his drink and learned that you can not read The New Yorker when people that you love have just died . He tried Time and he could read it all right , including Milestones , ' where the two boys were dead complete with their ages ; their mother 's age , not quite accurate ; her marital status , and the statement that she had divorced him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short item Thomas Hudson had the odd sensation that the man who wrote it was sorry that the boys were dead . He made himself another drink and thought how much better the Perrier was than anything else you could put in whisky and then he read both Time and Newsweek through . What the hell do you suppose she was doing at Biarritz ? he thought . At least she could have gone to St Jean-de-Luz . From that he knew that the whisky was doing some good . Give them up now , he told himself . Just remember how they were and write them off . You have to do it sooner or later . Do it now . Read some more , he said . Just then the ship started to move . It was moving very slowly and he did not look out of the window of the sitting room . He sat in the comfortable chair and read through the pile of papers and magazines and drank the Scotch and Perrier . You have n't any problem at all , he told himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should not have loved them so damn much in the first place . You should n't have loved them and you should n't have loved their mother . Listen to the whisky talking , he said to himself . What a solvent of our problems . The solvent alchemist that in a trice our leaden gold into shit transmutes . That does n't even scan . Our leaden gold to shit transmutes is better . I wonder where Roger is with that girl , he thought . The bank will know where Tommy is . I know where I am . I 'm in here with a bottle of Old Parr . Tomorrow I 'll sweat this all out in the gym . 1 ' 1l use the heat box . I 'll ride on one of those bicycles that goesp176nowhere and on a mechanical horse . That 's what I need . A good ride on a mechanical horse . Then I 'll get a good rubdown . Then I 'll meet somebody in the bar and I 'll talk about other things . It 's only six days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night and when he woke in the night he heard the movement of the ship through the sea and at first , smelling the sea , he thought that he was at home in the house on the island and that he had wakened from a bad dream . Then he knew it was not a bad dream and he smelled the heavy grease on the edges of the open window . He switched the light on and drank some of the Perrier water . He was very thirsty . There was a tray with some sandwiches and fruit on the table where the steward had left them the night before and there was still ice in the bucket that held the Perrier . He knew he should eat something and he looked at the clock on the wall . It was three-twenty in the morning . The sea air was cool and he ate a sandwich and two apples and then took some ice out of the bucket and made himself a drink . The Old Parr was about gone but he had another bottle and now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfortable chair and drank and read The New Yorker . He found that he could read it now and he found that he enjoyed drinking in the night . For years he had kept an absolute rule about not drinking in the night and never drinking before he had done his work except on non-working days . But now , as he woke in the night , he felt the simple happiness of breaking training . It was the first return of any purely animal happiness or capacity for happiness that he had experienced since the cable had come . The New Yorker was very good , he thought . And it 's evidently a magazine you can read on the fourth day after something happens . Not on the first or the second or the third . But on the fourth . That was useful to know . After The New Yorker he read The Ring and then he read everything that was readable in The Atlantic Monthly and some that was not . Then he made his third drink and read Harper 's . You see , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all gone he lay on the fibre matting on the floor and listened to the wind . It was blowing a gale from the northwest and he spread blankets on the floor , piled pillows to brace against the stuffed chairback he placed against the leg of the living-room table , and wearing a long , peaked cap to shade his eyes , read his mail in the good light from the big reading lamp that stood on the table . His cat lay on his chest and he pulled a light blanket over them both and opened and read the letters and drank from a glass of whisky and water that he replaced on the floor between sips . His hand found the glass when he wanted it . The cat was purring , but he could not hear him because he had a silent purr , and he would hold a letter in one hand and touch the cat 's throat with the finger of his other hand . ' You have a throat mike , Boise , ' he said . Do you love me ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching in the wool of the man 's heavy blue jersey and he felt the cat 's long , lovingly spread weight and the purring under his fingers . ' She 's a bitch , Boise , ' he told the cat and opened another letter . The cat put his head under the man 's chin and rubbed it there. '  --  They 'll scratch the hell out of you , Boise , ' the man said and stroked the cat 's head with the stubble of his chin . Women do n't like them . It 's a shame you do n't drink , Boy . You do damned near everything else . ' The cat had originally been named after the cruiser Boise but now , for a long time , the man had called him Boy for short . Ile read the second letter through without comment and tca ( hed out and took a drink of the whisky and water . ' Well , ' he said . ' We are n't getting anywhere . I 'll tell you , Boy . You read the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How s ould you like that ? ' The cat put his head up to rub against the man 's chin and the man rubbed against it pushing his beard stubble down between the cat 's ears and along the back of his head and between his shoulder blades while he opened the third letter.  |p180Did  you worry about us , Boise , when the blow came up ? ' he asked . ' I wish you could have seen us come into the mouth of the harbour with the sea breaking over the Morro . You 'd have been spooked , Boy . We came in in a bloody , huge , breaking sea like a damn surfboard . ' The cat lay , contentedly , breathing in rhythm with the man . He was a big cat , long and loving , the man thought , and poor from much night hunting . Did you do any good while I was away , Boy ? ' He had laid the letter down and was stroking the cat under the blanket . Did you get many ? ' The cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caressed the way he had done when he was a kitten , in the time when he had been happy . The man put his arms around him and held him tight against his chest , the big cat on his side , his head under the man 's chin . Under the pressure of the man 's arms he turned suddenly and lay flat against the man , his claws dug into the sweater , his body pressed tight . He was not purring now . I 'm sorry , Boy , ' the man said . I 'm awfully sorry . Let me read this other damned letter . There 's nothing we can do . You do n't know anything to do  --  do you ? ' The cat lay against him , heavy and unpurring and desperate . The man stroked him and read the letter . Just take it easy , Boy , ' he said . There is n't any solution . If I ever find any solution I 'll tell you . ' By the time he had finished the third and longest letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asleep in the position of the Sphinx , but with his head lowered in the man 's chest . I 'm awfully glad , the man thought . I ought to undress and take a bath and go to bed properly but there will be no hot water and I would n't sleep in a bed tonight . Too much movement . The bed would throw me . Probably wo n't sleep here either with that old beast on me . Boy , ' he said . ' I 'm going to lift you off so I can lie on my side . ' He lifted the heavy limp weight of the cat , that came alive suddenly in his hands , and then was limp again , and laid him by his side , then turned over to rest on his right elbow . The cat lay along his back . He had resented it while he was being moved but now he was asleep again , curled up against the man . The man took the three letters and read them through for the second time.  |p181I  le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the light out and lay on his side , feeling the touch of the cat 's body against his buttocks . He lay with his two arms around a pillow and his head on another pillow . Outside the wind was blowing hard and the floor of the room still had some of the motion of the flying bridge . He had been on the bridge nineteen hours before they had come in . He lay there and tried to sleep , but he could not . His eyes were very tired and he did not want the light on , nor to read , so he lay there and waited for morning . Through the blankets he could feel the matting , made to the measure of the big room , that had been brought from Samoa on a cruiser six months before Pearl . It covered all the tiled floor of the room , but where the French doors opened on to the patio it had been bent back and buckled by the movement of the doors and he could feel the wind get under it and billow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door frames . He thought this wind would blow from the northwest at least another day , then go into the north and finally blow itself out from the northeast . That was the way it moved in winter but it might say in the northeast for several days , blowing hard , before it settled into the brisa which was the local name for the northeast trade wind . Blowing at gale force out of the northeast against the Gulf Stream it made a very heavy sea , one of the heaviest he had ever seen anywhere , and he knew no Kraut would surface in it . So , he thought , we will be ashore at least four days . Then they will be up for sure . He thought about this last trip and how the blow had caught them sixty miles down the coast and thirty offshore and the punishingtrip in when he had decided to come into Havana rather than Bahia Honda . He had punished her all right . He had punishedher plenty and there were several things he would have to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bahia I londa . But they had been in there too much lately . He had been out twelve days , too , expecting to be out not more than ten . He was low on certain things and he could not be at all sure of the duration of this blow ; so he had made the decision to come into Havana and had taken the beating . In the morning he would bathe , shave , clean up , and go in and make his report to the Naval Attache . They might have wanted him to stay down the coast . But he knew nothing would surface in this weather ; it wasp182impossible for them to . That was all there was to it , really . If he was right on that , the rest of it would be OK although things were not always that simple . They certainly were not . The floor hardened against his right hip and his thigh and right shoulder , so he lay on his back now and rested against the muscles of his shoulders , drawing his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket . This took some of the tiredness out of his body and he put his left hand on the sleeping cat and stroked him . You relax awfully well , Boy , and you sleep good , ' he said to the cat . ' I guess it is n't too bad , then . ' He thought of letting some of the other cats out so he would have them to talk to and for company now that Boise was asleep . But he decided against it . It would hurt Boise and make him jealous . Boise had been outside the house waiting for them when they had driven up in the station wagon . He had been terribly excited and had been underfoot during the unloading , greeting everyone and slipping in and out each time a door was opened . He had probably waited outside every night since they left . From the time he had orders to go , the cat knew it . Certainly he could not tell about orders ; but he knew the first symptoms of preparation , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people sleeping in the house ( he always had them sleep in by midnight when leaving before daylight ) , the cat became steadily more upset and nervous until , finally , when they loaded to leave , he was desperate and they had to be careful to lock him in so that he would not follow down the drive , into the village , and out on to the highway . One time on the Central Highway he had seen a cat that had been hit by a car and the cat , fresh hit and dead , looked exactly like Boy . His back was black and his throat , chest , and forefeet were white and there was the black mask across his face . He knew it could n't be Boy because it was at least six miles from the farm ; but it had made him feel sick inside and he had stopped the car and gone back and lifted the cat and made sure it was not Boy and then laid him by the side of the road so nothing else would run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he knew he was someone 's cat , and he left him by the road so they would find him and know about him rather than have to worry aboutp183him . Otherwise he would have taken the cat into the car and had him buried at the farm . That evening , coming back to the farm , the body of the cat was gone from where he had left him so he thought that his people must have found him . That night , when he had sat in the big chair reading , with Boise by his side in the chair , he had thought that he did not know what he would do if Boise should be killed . He thought , from his actions and his desperations , that the cat felt the same way about the man . He sweats them out worse than I do . Why do you do it , Boy ? if you would take them easier you would be much better off . I take them as easy as I can , he said to himself . I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Boise and his strange habits and his desperate , hopeless love . He remembered him the first time he had seen him when he was a kitten playing with his reflection on the glass top of the cigar counter of the bar at Cojimar that was built out on the rocks overlooking the harbour . They had come down to the bar on a bright Christmas morning . There were a few drunks there left over from the celebration of the night before , but the wind was blowing freshly from the east through the open restaurant and the bar , and the light was so bright and the air felt so new and cool that it was no morning for drunks . ' Shut the doors against the wind , ' one of them said to the proprietor . ' No , ' the proprietor said . ' I like it . Go and find a lee somewhere else if it 's too fresh . ' ' We pay to be comfortable , ' one of the leftovers from the night 's drinking said . ' No . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be comfortable . ' I lc looked out across the open terrace of the bar at the sea , dark blue and with whitecaps , with the fishing boats crisscrossing it sailing and trolling for dolphin . There were half a dozen fishermenat the bar and two tables of them sitting on the terrace . I hey were fishermen who had done well the day before , or who believed the good weather and the current would hold and were taking a chance and staying in for Christmas . None of them that the man , whose name was Thomas Hudson , knew ever went to church even on Christmas and none of them dressed , consciously ,  |p184as  fishermen . They were the most unfishermanlike fishermen he had ever known and they were among the very best . They wore old straw hats , or were bareheaded . They wore old clothes and were sometimes barefooted and sometimes they wore shoes . You could tell a fisherman from a countryman , or guajiro , because the countrymen wore formalized pleated shirts , wide hats , tight trousers , and riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them carried machetes , while the fishermen wore the remnants of any old clothes they had and were cheerful , self-confident men . The country men were reserved and shy unless they were drinking . The only way you could tell a fisherman , surely , was by his hands . The hands of the old men were gnarled and brown , spotted with sun blotches , and the palms and fingers were deep cut and scarred by the handlines . The young men 's hands were not gnarled ; but most of them had the sun blotches and they were all deeply scarred and the hair on the hands and arms of all but the very darkest men was bleached by the sun and the salt . Thomas Hudson remembered how on this Christmas morning , the first Christmas of the war , the proprietor of the bar had asked him , ' Do you want some shrimps ? ' and brought a big plate piled with fresh cooked prawns and put it on the bar while he sliced a yellow lime and spread the slices on a saucer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over the edge of the bar for more than a foot and he had picked one up and spread the long whiskers to their full width and remarked that they were longer than those of a Japanese admiral . Thomas Hudson broke the head off the Japanese admiral prawn and then split open the belly of the shell with his thumbs and shucked the prawn out and it was so fresh and silky feeling under his teeth , and had such a flavour , cooked in sea water with fresh lime juice and whole black peppercorns , that he thought he had never eaten a better one ; not even in Malaga nor in Tarragona nor in Valencia . It was then that the kitten came over to him , scampering down the bar , to rub against his hand and beg a prawn . They 're too big for you , cotsie , ' he said . But he snipped off a piece of one with his thumb and finger and gave it to the kitten who ran with it back to the tobacco counter to eat it quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his handsome blackp185and white markings , his white chest and forelegs and the black , like a formal mask across his eyes and forehead , eating the prawn and growling , and asked the proprietor who he belonged to . You if you want him . ' ' I have two at the house . Persians . ' ' Two is nothing . Take this one . Give them a little Cojimar Mood . ' ' Papa , ca n't we have him ? ' asked the one of his sons , that he did not think about any more , who had come up from the steps of the terrace where he had been watching the fishing boats come in , seeing the men unstep their masts , unload their coiled lines , and throw their fish ashore . ' Please , papa , ca n't we have him ? I le 's a beautiful cat . ' ' Do you think he 'd be happy away from the sea ? ' ' Certainly , papa . He 'll be miserable here in a little while . I lave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets ? And they were probably just like him once . ' ' Take him , ' the proprieter said . ' He 'll be happy on a farm . ' ' Listen , Tomas , ' one of the fishermen who had been listening to the conversation from the table said . ' If you want cats I can get an Angora , a genuine Angora , from Guanabacoa . A true Tiger Angora . ' ' Male ? ' ' As much as you , ' the fisherman said . At the table they all laughed . Nearly all Spanish joking had that same base . ' But with fur on them , ' the fisherman tried for another laugh and got it . Papa , can we please have this cat ? ' The boy asked . ' This cat Is a male . ' ' Are you sure ? ' know , papa . I know . ' What 's what you said about both the Persians . ' ' Persians are different , papa . I was wrong on the Persians and I Admit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ' ' Listen , Tomas . Do you want the Angora Tiger from Guanahacoa ? ' the fisherman asked . ' What is he ? A witchcraft cat ? ' Witchcraft nothing . This cat never even heard of Saint Bar-t barn . This cat is more of a Christian than you are . ' ' Es muy posible , ' another fisherman said and they all laughed.  |p186What  does this famous beast cost ? ' Thomas Hudson asked . Nothing . He 's a gift . A genuine Angora Tiger . He 's a Christmasgift . ' Come on up to the bar and have a drink and describe him to me . ' The fisherman came up to the bar . He wore hornrimmed glasses and a clean , faded , blue shirt that looked as though it would not stand another washing . It was lacy thin in back between the shoulders and the fabric was beginning to rip . He had on faded khaki trousers and was barefoot on Christmas . His face and hands were burned a dark wood colour and he put his scarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whisky with ginger ale . ' ' Ginger ale makes me sick , ' Thomas Hudson said . Let me have one with mineral water . ' It 's very good for me , ' the fisherman said . I like Canada Dry . Otherwise I do n't like the taste of the whisky . Listen , Tomas . This is a serious cat . ' Papa , ' the boy said , before you and this gentleman start drinking , can we have this cat ? ' He had tied a shrimp husk on the end of a piece of white cotton string and was playing with the kitten , who was standing on his hind legs , as a rampant lion does in heraldry , boxing with the lure the boy swung at him . ' Do you want him ? ' You know I want him . ' You can have him . ' Thank you very much , papa . I 'm going to take him out to the car to gentle him . ' Thomas Hudson watched the boy cross the road with the kitten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The top of the car was down and from the bar he watched the boy , his brown hair flattened by the wind , sitting in the convertible in the bright sunlight . He could not see the kitten because the boy was holding him on the seat , sitting low on the seat out of the wind , stroking the kitten . Now the boy was gone and the kitten had grown into an old cat and had outlived the boy . The way he and Boise felt now , he thought , neither one wanted to outlive the other . I do n't know how many people and animals have been in love before , hep187thought . It probably is a very comic situation . But I do n't find it comic at all . No , he thought , I do not find it comic any more than it is comic for a boy 's cat to outlive him . Many things about it are certainly ridiculous , as Boise was when he growled and then made that sudden tragic cry and stiffened his whole length against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not eat 1or several days after the man was gone but his hunger always drove him to it . Although there were days when he tried to live by his hunting and would not come in with the other cats , he always came in finally and he would leap out of the room over the backs of the other crowding cats when the door was opened by the servant that brought the tray of ground meat and then leap back in over all the other cats as they milled around the boy i ho had brought the food . He always ate very quickly and then wanted to leave the cat room as soon as he had finished . There was no cat that he cared for in any way . For a long time now the man thought that Boise had regarded himself as a human being . He did not drink with the man as a bear would but he ate everything the man ate especially all of those things cats would not touch . Thomas Hudson remembered the summer before when they had been eating breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chilled mango . Boise had eaten it with delight and he had mango every morning as long as Thomas Hudson was ashore and the mango season lasted . He had to hold the slices for him so he could get them into his mouth since they were too slippery for the cat to pick off the plate and he thought he must rig some sort of a rack , like a toast rack , so the cat could take them without having to hurry. ' then when the alligator pear trees , the big , dark green agua-c ate with their fruit only a little darker and shinier than the foliage , had come into bearing this time when he had been ashore In September for overhaul , preparing to go down to Haiti , he had offered Boise a spoonful out of the shell , the hollow where the nerd had been , filled with oil and vinegar dressing , and the cat had eaten it and then afterwards at each meal , he had eaten half An aguacate . ' Why do n't you climb up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked the cat as they walked togetherp188over the hills of the property . But Boise , of course , had not answered . He had found Boy up in an alligator pear tree one evening when he had gone out in the dusk to walk and see the flight of blackbirds going in towards Havana where they flew each night from all the countryside to the south and east , converging in long flights to roost , noisily , in the Spanish laurel trees of the Prado . Thomas Hudson liked to watch the blackbirds come flying over the hills and to see the first bats come out in the evening and the very small owls coming out for their night flying when the sun went down into the sea beyond Havana and the lights began to come on over the hills . On that night he had missed Boise , who nearly always walked with him , and he had taken Big Goats , one of Boise 's sons , a big-shouldered , heavy-necked , wide-faced , tremendous-whiskered , black , fighting cat for the walk . Goats never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that kept him occupied . But he was cheerful , except where his work was concerned , and he liked to walk especially if Thomas Hudson would stop every now and then and push him hard with his foot so that he would lie flat on his side . Thomas Hudson would then stroke the cat 's belly with his foot . It was difficult to stroke Goats too hard or too roughly , and he would as soon be stroked with a shoe on as barefoot . Thomas Hudson had just reached down and patted him  --  he liked to be patted as strongly as you would pat a big dog  --  when he looked up and saw Boise well up in the alligator pear tree . Goats looked up and saw him too . ' What are you doing , you old bastard ? ' Thomas Hudson called to him . ' Have you finally started to eat them on the tree ? ' Boise looked down at them and saw Goats . ' Come on down and we 'll take a walk , ' Thomas Hudson told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Boise looked at Goats and said nothing . ' You look awfully handsome in those dark green leaves . Stay up if you want . ' Boise looked away from them and Thomas Hudson and the big black cat went on through the trees . ' Do you think he 's crazy , Goats ? ' the man asked . Then to please the cat he said , ' Do you remember the night we could n't find the medicine ? '  |p189Medicine  was a magic word with Goats and as soon as he heard it , he lay on his side to be stroked . ' Remember the medicine ? ' the man asked him and the big cat writhed in his hardy rough delight . Medicine had become a magic word with him one night when the man had been drunk , really drunk , and Boise would not sleep with him . Princessa would not sleep with him when he was drunk , nor would Willy . No one would sleep with him when he was drunk except Friendless , which was Big Goats ' early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister , and who was an unfortunate cat who had many sorrows and occasional ecstasies . Goats liked him drunk better than sober or , perhaps , it was because only when Thomas Hudson was drunk that Goats got to sleep with him that made it seem that way . But on this night Thomas Hudson had been ashore about four days when he got really drunk . It had started at noon at the Floridita and he had drunk first with Cuban politicians that had dropped in , nervous for a quick one ; with sugar planters and rice planters ; with Cuban government functionaries , drinking through their lunch hour ; with second and third secretaries of Embassy , shepherding someone to the Floridita ; with the inescapable FBI men , pleasant and all trying to look so average , clean-cut-young-American that ' , Iry stood out as clearly as though they had worn a bureau shoulder patch on their white linen or seersucker suits . He had drunk double frozen daiquiris , the great ones that Constante made , that had no taste of alcohol and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing feels running through powder allow and , after the sixth and eighth , felt like downhill glacier skiing feels when you are running unroped . Some Navy that he knew came in and he drank with them and then with some of the then-called Holligan Navy or Coast Guard . This was getting too near to shop , which he was drinking away from , so he went down to the far end of the bar where the old respectable whores Were , the fine old whores that every resident drinker at the Floridita had slept with sometime in the last twenty years , and oat on a stool with them and had a club sandwich and drank more double frozens . When he had come back to the farm that night he was very drunk and none of the cats would sleep with him but Goats , who was not allergic to the basic rum smell , had no prejudice againstp190drunkenness , and revelled in the rich whore smell , as full-bodied as a fine Christmas fruitcake . They slept heavily together , Goats purring loudly whenever he woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he had drunk , said to Goats , We 've got to take the medicine . ' Goats loved the sound of the word , which symbolized all this rich life he was sharing , and purred stronger than ever . Where is the medicine , Goats ? ' Thomas Hudson had asked . He turned on the reading light by the bed but it was dead . In the storm that had kept him ashore , wires had blown down or been shorted and not yet repaired and there was no electricity . He felt on the night table by the bed for the big double Seconal capsule , the last one that he had , that would put him to sleep again and let him wake in the morning without a hangover . He knocked it off the table as he reached in the darkness and he could n't find it . He felt all over the floor carefully and he could n't find it . He had no matches by the bed because he was not smoking and the flashlightbattery had been overused by the servants while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had said . We have to find the medicine . ' He had got out of bed and Goats came down on the floor , too , and they hunted for the medicine . Goats went under the bed , not knowing what he was hunting , but doing all he could , and Thomas Hudson said to him , The medicine , Goats . Find the medicine . ' Goats made whimpery cries under the bed and ranged all of the area . Finally he came out , purring , and Thomas Hudson , feelingover the floor , touched the capsule . It was dusty and cobwebbyunder his fingers . Goats had found it . You found the medicine , ' he had told Goats . ' You wonder cat . ' After he had washed off the capsule in the palm of his hand with some water from the carafe by the bed and then swallowed it with a drink of water he lay , feeling it take hold slowly , and praised Goats , and the big cat purred at the praise and always afterwards medicine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about Goats as well as Boise . But there was nothing tragic about Goats . Although he had been through some truly bad times he was absolutely entire and , even when he had been beaten in some of his most terrible fights , he was never pitiful . Even when he had not been able to walk up to the housep191and lay under the mango tree below the terrace panting and soaked wet with sweat so you saw how big his shoulders were and how narrow and thin his flanks , lying there , too dead to move , trying to get the air into his lungs , he was never pitiful . He had the wide head of a lion and he was as unbeaten . Goats was fond of the man , and Thomas Hudson was fond of him and respected and loved him . But there was no question of Goats being in love with him or he in love with Goats as there had come to be with Boise . Boise had simply become worse and worse . The night he and Goats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed out late and not come in when the man had gone to bed . He was sleeping in the big bed then in the bedroom at the far end of the house where there were big windows on all three sides of the room and the breeze blew through at nights . When he woke he listened to the noises of the night birds and he was awake and listening when he heard Boise lap up on to the window ledge . Boise was a very silent cat . But he called to the man as soon as he was on the window ledge and Thomas Hudson went to the screen and opened it . Boise leaped in . He had two fruit rats in his mouth . In the moonlight that came in through the window , throwing the shadow of the trunk of the ceiba tree across the wide , white bed , Boise had played with the fruit rats . Leaping and turning , batting them along the floor , and then carrying one away to crouch and rush the other , he had played as wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried them into the bathroom and after that Thomas Hudson had felt his weight as he jumped up on the bed . ' So you were n't eating mangoes out of trees ? ' the man had asked him . Boise rubbed his head against him . ' So you were hunting and looking after the property ? My old tat and brother Boise . Are n't you going to eat them now you have them ? ' Boise had only rubbed his head against the man and purred wit h his silent purr and then , because he was tired from the hunt , he had gone to sleep . But he had slept restlessly and in the morning he had shown no interest in the dead fruit rats at all . Now it was getting daylight and Thomas Hudson , who had notp192been able to sleep , watched the light come and the grey trunks of the royal palms show in the grey of the first light . First he saw only the trunks and the outline of their tops . Then , as the light was stronger , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale and then , as the sun began to come up behind the hills , the palm trunks were whitish grey and their blowing branches a bright green and the grass of the hills was brown from the winter drought and the limestone tops of the far hills made them look as though they were crested with snow . He got up from the floor and put on moccasins and an old mackinaw coat and , leaving Boise sleeping curled up on the blanket , walked through the living room in to the dining room and out through it to the kitchen . The kitchen was in the north end of one wing of the house and the wind was wild outside , blowing the bare branches of the flamboydn tree against the walls and the windows . There was nothing to eat in the icebox and the screened-in kitchen safe was empty of everything but condiments , a can of American coffee , a tin of Lipton 's tea , and a tin of peanut oil for cooking . The Chinaman , who cooked , bought each day 's supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Hudson back and the Chinaman had undoubtedlygone to the market already to buy the day 's food for the servants . When one of the boys comes , Thomas Hudson thought , I 'll send him into town for some fruit and eggs . He boiled some water and made himself a pot of tea and took it and a cup and saucer back to the living room . The sun was up now and the room was bright and he sat in the big chair and drank the hot tea and looked at the pictures on the walls in the fresh , bright winter sunlight . Maybe I ought to change some of them , he thought . The best ones are in my bedroom and I 'm never in my bedroom any more . From the big chair , the living room looked huge after being on the boat . He did not know how long the room was . He had known , when he had ordered the matting , but he had forgotten . However long it was , it seemed three times as long this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh ashore ; that and that there was nothing in the icebox . The motion of the boat in the big confused sea the northwester had built up , blowing a gale across the heavy current , was all gone now . It was as far away from him now as the sea itself was . He could see the sea , lookingp193through the open doors of the white room and out of the windowsacross the tree clumped hills cut by the highway , the farther bare hills that were the old fortifications of the town , the harbour , and the white of the town beyond . But the sea was only the blue beyond the far white spread of the town . It was as distant now as all things that were past and he meant to keep it that way , now that the motion was gone , until it was time to go out on to it again. the Krauts can have it for the next four days , he thought . Iunder if the fish hang close under them and play around them when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the motion goes . There are fish in these waters at any depth that they submerge to . The fish are probably very interested . Some of the submarine bottoms must be pretty foul and the fish would certainly fool around them . They are probably not foul much though on the schedules they run . The fish would be around them anyway . He thought a moment of the sea and how it would really be offshore today with the hills of blue water with the white blowing from their crests and then he put it away from him . ' I he cat , asleep on the blanket , woke as the man reached over and stroked him . He yawned and stretched his front legs , then curled up again . ' I never had a girl that waked when I did , ' the man said . And now I have n't even got a cat that does . Go on and sleep , Boy . It 's a ( Limned lie , anyway . I had a girl that woke when I did and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've never known a woman that was any damn good . You had bad luck , Boise . The hell with it . You know what ? We ought to have a good woman , Boy . We ( wild both be in love with her . If you could support her you could have her . I 've never seen one that could live on fruit rats very long , though . ' I he tea had dulled his hunger for a moment but now he was vvry hungry again . At sea he would have eaten a big breakfast an hour ago and probably had a mug of tea an hour before that . It had been too rough to cook on the run in and he had eaten a couple of corned beef sandwiches with thick slices of raw onion on them on the flying bridge . But he was very hungry now and he was irritated that there was nothing in the kitchen . I must buyp194some canned stuff and keep it here for coming in , he thought . But I 'll have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use it up and I hate to lock up food in a house . Finally he poured himself a Scotch whisky and water and sat in the chair and read the accumulated daily papers and felt the drink soothe the hunger and ease the nervousness of being home . You can drink today if you want , he told himself . Once you 've checked in . If it 's this cold , there wo n't be many people at the Floridita . It will be good to be there again , though . He did not know whether to eat there or up at the Pacifico . It will be cold at the Pacifico , too , he thought . But I 'll have a sweater and a coat and there is a table in the lee of the wall by the bar that will be out of the wind . ' I wish you liked to travel , Boy , ' he told the cat . ' We could have a fine day in town . ' Boise did not like to travel . He was terrified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still frightened of the veterinary surgeons . Goats would have made a good car cat , he thought . Probablywould have been a hell of a boat cat , too , except for the spraying . I ought to let them all out . I wish I could have brought them some sort of a present . I 'll get catnip in town if there is any and get Goats and Willy and Boy drunk tonight on it . There still should be some catnip in the shelf of drawers of the cat room if it has n't gotten too dry and lost its force . It lost its force very quickly in the tropics and the catnip that you raised in the gardenhad no force at all . I wish we non-cats had something that was as harmless as catnip that would have as much effect , he thought . Why do n't we have something like that we can get drunk on ? The cats were very odd about catnip . Boise , Willy , Goats , Friendless 's Brother , Littless , Furhouse , and Taskforce were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants had given Baby , the blue Persian , would never touch catnip ; neither would Uncle Woolfie , the grey Persian . With Uncle Woolfie , who was as stupid as he was beautiful , it could have been stupidity or insularity . Uncle Woolfie would never try anything new and would sniff cautiously at any new food until the other cats had taken it all and he was left with nothing . But Princessa , who was the grandmother of all the cats and was intelligent , delicate , highprincipled , aristocratic , and most loving , was afraid of the odourp195of catnip and fled from it as though it were a vice . Princessa was such a delicate and aristocratic cat , smoke grey , with golden eyes and beautiful manners , and such a great dignity that her periods of being in heat were like an introduction to , and explanation . ind finally exposition of , all the scandals of royal houses . Since he had seen Princessa in heat , not the first tragic time , but after she was grown and beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantonness , Thomas Hudson knew that he did not want to die without having made love to a prin t e  --  ss as lovely as Princessa . She must be as grave and as delicate and as beautiful as Prine.ssabefore they were in love and made the love and then be as shameless and as wanton in their bed as Princessa was . He drcamed about this princess sometimes in the nights and nothing t hat could ever happen could be any better than the dreams were but he wanted it actually and truly and he was quite sure he would have it if there were any such princess . The trouble was that the only princess that he had ever made love to outside of Italian princesses , who did not count , was quite a plain girl with thickish ankles and not very good legs . She had a lovely northern skin , though , and shining well-brushed hair and he liked her face and her eyes and he liked her and her hand felt good in his hand when they stood by the rail going through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They liked each other very much and they were already close to being in love ; lose enough so that she had to be careful about the tone of their voices when they were with other people ; and close enough so that , now , when they were holding each other 's hands in the dark against the rail he could feel what there was between them with no doubt about it at all . Feeling this and being sure , he had spoken to her about it and had asked her something since they made a great thing about being completely frank with each other about everything . I would like to very much , ' she said . ' As you know . But I cannot . As you know . ' But there is some way , ' Thomas Hudson had said . ' There 's always some way . ' You mean in a lifeboat ? ' she said . ' I would n't want it in a lifeboat . '  |p196'Look  , ' he said and he put his hand on her breast and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is nice , ' she interrupted . ' There are two of them you know . ' ' I know . ' ' That 's very nice , ' she said . ' You know I love you , Hudson . I just found out today . ' ' How ? ' ' Oh I just found out . It was n't terribly difficult . Did n't you find out anything ? ' ' I did n't have to find out anything , ' he lied . ' That 's good , ' she said . ' But the lifeboat is no good . Your cabin is no good . My cabin is no good . ' ' We could go to the Baron 's cabin . ' ' There 's someone always in the Baron 's cabin . The wickedBaron . Is n't it nice to have a wicked Baron just as in olden times ? ' ' Yes , ' he said . ' But I could make sure there would be no onethere . ' ' No . That 's no good . Just love me very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love me all you can and do what you are doing . ' He did and then he did something else . ' No , ' she said . ' Do n't do that . I could n't stand that . ' She did something then and said , ' Can you stand that ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Good . I 'll hold there very good . No . Do n't kiss me . If you kiss me here on deck then we might as well have done everything else . ' ' Why do n't we do everything else ? ' ' Where , Hudson ? Where ? Tell me in this life about where ? ' ' I 'll tell you about why . ' ' I know all about why . Where is the problem . ' ' I love you very much . ' ' Oh yes . I love you , too . And no good will come of it , except we love each other which is good . ' He did something then and she said , ' Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Let 's sit down . ' ' No . Let 's stand up just as we are here . ' ' Do you like what you are doing ? '  |p197'Yes  . I love it . Do you mind ? ' ' No . But it does n't go on for ever . ' ' All right , ' she said and she turned her head and kissed him quickly and then looked out again across the desert they were Sliding by in the night . It was winter and the night was cool and they stood close together looking straight out . ' You can do it , then . A mink coat is good for something finally in the tropics . You wo n't before me ? ' ' No . ' ' You promise ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Oh Hudson . Please . Please now . ' ' You ? ' ' Oh yes . Any time with you . Now . Now . Oh yes . Now . ' ' Really now ? ' ' Oh yes . Believe me now . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bank of the canal and the distance beyond was still slidingby . ' Now are you ashamed of me ? ' she asked . ' No . I love you very much . ' ' But it 's bad for you and I was selfish . ' ' No . I do n't think it is bad for me . And you 're not selfish . ' ' Do n't think it was a waste . It was n't a waste . Truly not forme . ' ' Then it was n't a waste . Kiss me , will you ? ' ' No . I ca n't . Just hold your hand against me tight . ' Later she said , ' You do n't mind how fond I am of him ? ' ' No . He 's very proud . ' ' Let me tell you a secret . ' She told him a secret that did not come to him as a great surprise . ' Is that very wicked ? ' ' No , ' he said . ' That 's jolly . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you very much . Please go and mike yourself comfortable in every way and then come back to me here . Should we have a bottle of champagne at the Ritz ? ' ' That would be lovely . What about your husband ? ' ' I Ie 's still playing bridge . I can see him through the window . After he finishes he will look for us and join us. '  |p198So  they had gone to the Ritz which was at the stern of the ship and had a bottle of Perrier-Jouet Brut 1915 and then another one and after a while the Prince had joined them . The Prince was very nice and Hudson liked him . They had been hunting in East Africa , as he had been , and he had met them at the Muthaiga Club and at Torr 's in Nairobi and they had taken the same boat from Mombasa . The ship was a round-the-world cruise ship which made a stop at Mombasa en route for Suez , the Mediterranean , and eventually Southampton . It was a super luxury ship where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold out for the world cruise as ships were in those years but some of the passengers had left the ship in India and one of those men who know about everything had told Thomas Hudson in the Muthaiga Club that the ship was coming in with several vacancies and that passage on her might be had quite reasonably . He had told the Prince and Princess , who had not enjoyed flying out to Kenya in those times when the Handley Pages were so slow and the flight so long and tiresome , and they had been delighted with the idea of the trip and the rates . We 'll have such a jolly trip and you 're a wonderful chap to have found out about it , ' the Prince had said . I 'll ring them up about it in the morning . ' It had been a jolly trip , too , with the Indian Ocean blue and the ship coming out slowly from the new harbour and then Africa was behind them , and the old white town with the great trees and all the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reef as they passed and then the ship gained speed and was in the open ocean and flying fish were splitting out of the water and ahead of the ship . Africa dropped to a long blue line behind them and a steward was beating on a gong and he and the Prince and the Princess and the Baron , who was an old friend and lived out there and was really wicked , were having a dry martini in the bar . Pay no attention to that gong and we 'll lunch in the Ritz , ' the Baron said . ' Do you agreeHe had not slept with the Princess on the ship although by the time they had reached Haifa they had done so many other things that they had both reached a sort of ecstasy of desperation that was so intense that they should have been required by law to sleep with each other until they could not stand it another timep199simply for the relief of their nerves , if for no other reason . Insteadfrom Haifa they made a motor trip to Damascus . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chauffeur and the two of them sat in back . Thomas Hudson saw a small part of the Holy Land and a small part of the T. E. Lawrence ( ountry and many cold hills and much desert on the way up , and on the way back they sat in the back and the Prince sat in front w i t h the chauffeur . Thomas Hudson saw the back of the Prince 's head and the back of the chauffeur 's head on the return trip and he remembered now that the road from Damascus to Haifa , where the ship was anchored in the harbour , runs down a river . ' I here is a steep gorge in the river but it is very small as it would he on a small-scale relief map and in the gorge there is an island . Ile remembered the island better than anything on the trip . The trip to Damascus did not help much and when they had kit I laifa and the ship was headed out across the Mediterranean and they were up on the boat deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was making a sea that the ship was beginning to buck slowly , she said to him . ' We have to do something . ' Do you like understatement ? ' No . I want to go to bed and stay in it for a week . ' ' A week does n't sound very long . ' ' A month then . But we have to do it right away and right sway we ca n't . ' We can go down to the Baron 's cabin . ' No . I do not want to do it until we can do it really without worrying . ' ' I low do you feel now ? ' ' As though I were going crazy and were already quite a way there .. . In Paris we can make love in a bed . ' ' But how do I get away ? I have no experience of how to getaway . ' ' You go shopping . ' ' But I have to go shopping with someone . ' ' You can go shopping with someone . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I so much did not want to ever have to do that . ' Do n't do it then . ' No . I must . I know I must . But that does not make it better . '  |p200'Were  you never unfaithful to him before ? ' ' No . And I thought I never would be . But now it is all that I want to do . But it hurts me that anyone should know . ' ' We 'll figure out something . ' ' Please put your arm around me and hold me very close against you , ' she said . ' Please let us not talk , nor think , nor worry . Please just hold your arm tight and love me very much because I ache now everywhere . ' After a while he had said to her , ' Look , whenever you do this it is going to be as bad for you as now . You do n't want to be unfaithful and you do n't want anyone to know . But it will be like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But I do n't want to hurt him . I have to do it . It 's not in my hands any more . ' ' Then do it . Now . ' ' But it 's terribly dangerous now . ' ' Do you think there is anyone on this ship that sees us and hears us and knows us that thinks we have not slept together ? Do you think the things we have done are any different from that ? ' ' Oh , of course they are different . There is all the difference . We could n't have a baby from what we have done . ' ' You 're wonderful , ' he had said . ' You really are . ' ' But if we have a baby I 'll be glad . He wants a baby very much and we never have one . I 'll sleep with him right away and he 'll never know it is ours . ' ' I would n't sleep with him right away . ' ' No I suppose not . But the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? ' ' Oh I sleep with him every night . I have to , Hudson . I get so excited I have to . I think that 's one reason he plays bridge until so late now . He 'd like me to be asleep when he comes in . I think he is getting a little tired since we have been in love . ' ' Is this the first time you have ever been in love since you married him ? ' ' No . I am sorry . But it is not . I have been in love several times . But I have never been unfaithful to him or even considered it . He is so good and nice and such a good husband and I like him so much and he loves me and is always kind to me . ' I think we had better go down to the Ritz and have somep201champagne , ' Thomas Hudson had said . His feelings were becomingvery mixed . The Ritz was deserted and a waiter brought them the wine at one of the tables against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on ice all of the time now and simply asked , ' The same wine , Mr Hudson ? ' They raised their glasses to each other and the Princess said , I love this wine . Do n't you ? ' ' Very much . ' ' What are you thinking about ? ' ' You . ' ' Naturally . All I think about is you . But what about me ? ' ' I was thinking we should go down to my cabin now . We talk too much and fool around too much and do nothing . What time have you ? ' " Ten after eleven . ' ' What time have you ? ' he called to the wine steward . ' Eleven-fifteen , sir . ' The steward looked at the clock inside the bar . When the steward was out of earshot , he asked , How late will he play bridge ? ' ' He said he would play late and for me not to stay awake for him . ' ' We 'll finish the wine and go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson , it is very dangerous . ' ' It will always be dangerous , ' Thomas Hudson had said . But not doing it is getting to be a damned sight more dangerous . ' That night he made love to her three times and when he took hrr to her cabin , she had said that he should n't and he had said it would look much sounder if he did , the Prince was still playing bridge . Thomas Hudson had gone back to the Ritz , where the bar was still open , and ordered another bottle of the same wine and lead the papers that had come aboard at Haifa . He realized that it was the first time he had had time to read the papers in a long time and he felt very relaxed and very happy to be reading the papers . When the bridge game broke up and the Prince came by and looked into the Ritz , Thomas Hudson asked him to have a glass of wine before he went to bed and he liked the Prince more than ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron had got off the ship at Marseilles . Most of thep202others were going on for the rest of the cruise , which finished at Southampton . In Marseilles he and the Baron were sitting at a sidewalk restaurant in the Vieux Port eating moules marines and drinking a carafe of vin rose . Thomas Hudson was very hungry and he remembered that he had been hungry most of the time ever since they had left Haifa . He was damned hungry now , too , he thought . Where the hell were those servants ? At least one should have shown up . It was blowing colder than ever outside . It reminded him of the cold day there on the steep street in Marseilles that ran down to the port , sitting at the cafe table with their coat collars up eating the moules out of the thin black shells you lifted from the hot , pepperymilk broth with hot melted butter floating in it , drinking the wine from Tavel that tasted the way Provence looked , and watching the wind blow the skirts of the fisherwomen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they climbed the steep cobbled street with the mistral lashing at them . You have been a very naughty boy , ' the Baron had said . ' Very naughty indeed . ' ' Do you want some more moules ? ' ' No . I want something solid . ' ' Should n't we have a bouillabaisse , too ? ' ' Two soups ? ' ' I 'm hungry . And we wo n't be here again for a long time . ' ' I should think you might be hungry . Good . We 'll have a bouillabaisseand then a good Chdteaubriand very rare . I 'll build you up , you bastard . ' What are you going to do ? ' ' The question is what are you going to do . Do you love her ? ' ' No . ' That 's much better . It is better for you to leave now . Much better . ' ' I promised to spend some time with them for the fishing . ' ' If it were the shooting it might be worthwhile , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and very unpleasant and she has no business to make a fool of her husband . ' ' He must know about it . ' ' He does not . He knows she is in love with you . That is all . You are a gentleman so whatever you do is all right . But she has nop203business to make a fool of her husband . You would n't marry her , Would you ? ' ' No . ' ' She could n't marry you anyway and there is no need that he should be made unhappy unless you are in love with her . ' ' I 'm not . I know that now . ' ' ' Then I think you should get out . ' ' I 'm quite sure that I should . ' ' I 'm so glad that you agree . Now tell me truly , how is she ? ' ' She 's very well . ' ' Do n't be silly . I knew her mother . You should have known her mother . ' ' I 'm sorry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how you got yourself mixed up with such good dull people . You do n't need her for your painting or anything like that , do you ? ' ' No . That 's not the way it 's done . I like her very much . I still like her . But I 'm not in love with her and it 's getting very cotnplicated . ' ' I 'm so glad that you agree . Now where do you think that you will go ? ' ' We 've just come from Africa . ' ' Ixactly . Why do n't you go to Cuba for a while or the Bahamas ? I could join you if I get hold of any money at home . ' ' I ) o you think you will get any money at home ? ' ' No . ' ' I think I will stay in Paris for a while . I 've been away from town for a long time . ' ' Paris is n't town . London is town . ' ' I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you what 's going on . ' ' No . I mean I want to see the pictures and some people and go to the Six-Day and Auteuil and Enghien and Le Tremblay . Why do n't you stay ? ' ' I do n't like racing and I ca n't afford to gamble . ' And why go on with that ? he thought now . The Baron was dead and the Krauts had Paris and the Princess did not have a baby . There would be no blood of his in any royal house , he thought , unless he had a nosebleed sometime in Buckinghamp204Palace , which seemed extremely unlikely . If one of those boys did not come in twenty minutes , he decided , he would go down into the village and get some eggs and some bread . It is a hell of a thing to be hungry in your own house , he thought . But I 'm too damned tired to go down there . Just then he heard someone in the kitchen and he pushed the buzzer that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it burr twice in the kitchen . The second houseboy came in with his faintly fairy , half Saint Sebastian , sly , crafty , and long-suffering look and said , ' You rang ? ' ' What the hell do you think I did ? Where is Mario ? ' ' He went for the mail . ' ' How are all the cats ? ' ' Very well . Without news . Big Goats fought with El Gordo . But we treated the wounds . ' ' Boise looks thin . ' ' He goes out much at night . ' ' How is Princessa ? ' ' She was a little sad . But she eats well now . ' Did you have difficulty getting meat ? ' ' We got it from Cotorro . ' ' How are the dogs ?

How was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , irritated and short as always with this boy who he had let go twice but had taken back each time when his father had come and pled for him , Mario , the first houseboy , came in carrying the papers and the mail . He was smiling and his brown face was gay and kind and loving . ' How was the voyage ? ' ' A little rough at the end . ' ' Figurate . Imagine it . It 's a big norther . Have you eaten ? ' ' There 's nothing to eat . ' ' I brought eggs and the milk and bread . Tu , ' he said to the second houseboy . ' Go in and prepare the caballero 's breakfast . How do you want the eggs ? '  |p205'As  usual . ' ' Los huevos como siempre , ' Mario said . ' Was Boise there to meet you ? ' ' Yes . ' ' He has suffered very much this time . More than ever . ' ' And the others ? ' ' Only one bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishnames proudly . ' The Princessa was a little sad . But it was nothing . ' ' iY to ? ' ' Me ? ' He smiled shyly and very pleased . ' Very well . Thank you very much . ' ' And the family ? ' ' All very well , thank you . Papa is working again . ' ' I am glad . ' ' He is , too . Did none of the other gentlemen sleep here ? ' ' No . They all went into town . ' ' They must be tired . ' ' They are . ' ' There were calls from various friends . I have them all written down . I hope you can recognize them . I can do nothing with the l ' . english names . ' ' Write them as they sound . ' ' But they do not sound the same to me as to you . ' ' Did the Colonel call ? ' ' No sir . ' ' Bring me a whisky with mineral water , ' Thomas Hudson said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In the dining room or here ? ' ' The whisky here . The milk for the cats in the dining room . ' ' Instantly , ' Mario said . He went to the kitchen and came backwith a whisky and mineral water . ' I think it is strong enough , ' hesaid . Should I shave now or wait until after breakfast ? Thomas I ludson thought . I ought to shave . That 's what I ordered the whisky for , to get me through the shaving . All right , go in and have then . The hell with it , he thought . No . Go in and do it . It 's good for your damned morale and you have to go into town after Ieakfast . Shaving , he sipped the drink halfway through lathering , afterp206lathering , and during the process of relathering , and changing blades three times in getting the two-week stubble off his cheeks , chin , and throat . The cat walked around and watched him while he shaved and rubbed against his legs . Then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard the milk bowls being put down on the tiled floor of the dining room . He had not heard the click himself nor had he heard any calling . But Boise had heard it . Thomas Hudson finished shaving and poured his right hand full of the wonderful ninety-degree pure alcohol that was as cheap in Cuba as miserable rubbing alcohol in the States and doused it over his face , feeling its cold bite take away the soreness from the shaving . I do n't use sugar , nor smoke tobacco , he thought , but by God I get my pleasure out of what they distill in this country . The lower parts of the bathroom windows were painted over because the stone paved patio ran all around the house , but the upper halves of the windows were of clear glass and he could see the branches of the palm trees whipping in the wind . She 's blowingeven heavier than I thought . There would almost be time to haul out . But you ca n't tell . It all depends on what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fun not to think about the sea for the last few hours . Let 's keep it up , he thought . Let 's not think about the sea nor what is on it or under it , or anything connected with it . Let 's not even make a list of what we will not think of about it . Let 's not think of it at all . Let 's just have the sea in being and leave it at that . And the other things , he thought . We wo n't think about them either . ' Where would the senor like to have breakfast ? ' Mario asked . ' Any place away from the puta sea . ' ' In the living room or in the senor 's bedroom ? ' ' In the bedroom . Pull out the wicker chair and put the breakfaston a table by it . ' He drank the hot tea and ate a fried egg and some toast with orange marmalade . ' Is there no fruit ? ' ' Only bananas . ' ' Bring some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' That is superstition . '  |p207'But  while you were away a man died in the village from eating bananas when he was drinking rum . ' ' How do you know he was n't just a banana-eating rummy who died from rum ? ' ' No , senor . This man died very suddenly from drinking a small amount of rum after eating a large quantity of bananas . They were his own bananas from his garden . He lived on the hill behind the village and worked for the route number seven of the buses . ' ' May he rest in peace , ' Thomas Hudson said . ' Bring me a few bananas . ' Mario brought the bananas , small , yellow , ripe , from the tree in the garden . They were hardly bigger , peeled , than a man 's lingers and they were delicious . Thomas Hudson ate five of them . ' Observe me for symptoms , ' he said . ' And bring the Princessa to eat the other egg . ' ' I gave her an egg to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gave an egg to Boise and to Willy . ' ' What about Goats ? ' ' The gardener said it was not good for Goats to eat much until his wounds are healed . His wounds were severe . ' ' What sort of a fight was it ? ' ' It was very serious . They fought for nearly a mile . We lost t hem in the thorn brush beyond the garden . They fought with no noise at all ; the way they fight now . I do n't know who won . Big t oats came in first and we took care of his wounds . He came to the patio and lay beside the cistern . He could n't jump to the top of it . Fats came in an hour later and we cared for his wounds . ' ' Do you remember how loving they were when they were brothers ? ' ' Of course . But I am afraid now that Fats will kill Goats .

" Finished , " said Boomie . And both together cried , " WIPE YOURSELF ! " " Let 's go and how about it . " Simon started a tentative fingering . " Let 's do  --  I say we should do  --  let 's do Anne Shirley . Anne Shirley in the one where she 's just just gon na take a bath and she 's futzing around and she pulls up the dress and you see near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes and hands swished skyward .

" " Fuck Anne Shirley ! " Hymie cried . " Lufto . . . " Simon began . " Where . . . ? " Boomie began at the same instant . Hymie first cuffed them like handballs , then in a voicep80pitched for an auditorium said , " I propose hereby that  --  this is what I propose for a deal  --  Marshie should tell the thing with his mother , but he should tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers , first we hafta . " " Hasta be , " Marshall faltered , " put in with the proposal a dirty thing . " " Right , and no shit , a dirty thing . I propose and make hereby the motion how it hasta be a dirty thing . " By voice vote the motion was carried . Then Hymie let this be known : That he had one day searched all drawers for loose change ; that near a jockstrop and a batch of old union books his hand had struck against something hard ; that he had fished out a Louis Sherry ContinentalMixture box ; that while rummaging around the crochetneedles , fountain-pen bladders , cigarette-lighter cases , barrettes , and snips of tailor 's chalk he had for no good reason begun to breathe through his mouth and to fill up with criminaljoy ; that he likened this feeling to the feeling he had once under the bakery lady 's daughter 's window , when he knew without knowing he knew that she would soon undress ; that he had shaken out from a Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapshots ; that these three snapshots were blotchy and without borders and faded to the color of vanilla syrup ; that he had spotted his mother easily despite the playful aviator 's goggles that swam on her ; that she had been otherwise naked ; that she had been posed between two big mirrors in such a way as to show off his father 's young face and her own black bush ; that he had been struck with great force by this bush ; that it had reminded him of Mutt 's moustacheand Captain Katzenjammer 's beard . Then Simon let it be known that he too had beheld his mother 's black bush , and in this fashion : That on a certain Saturday morning his father had cramps ; that all through the day he lay about groaning and in great pain ; that his mother considered a call to Levinger , the Society doctor ; that shep81spoke of how she lacked confidence in him , of how long years ago she had tried reaching him and had lost two nickels on the call ; that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came she had kissed him and knuckled his neck and pleaded for old movie magazines ; that when he had writtenout his prescription she stuck her face into her hands ; that shaken by tearless sobbing she told him of what had recentlybefallen her ; that after doing the floors and the windowsand taking the bedding down from the roof she had suffered hot flushes on one cheek ; that she had been his mother 's best customer for pearl barley ; that for the fun of it and to ease an orphan 's mind he should take her pressure ; that she would make it quick and easy for him ; that with one hand she had pulled him into the bedroom and with the other shucked off house dress , undershirt , and bloomers ; that her black bush did not remind him of Mutt 's moustache or CaptainKatzenjammer 's beard ; that with a hat and a cigarette holder it could be Charlie Chan . Then Boomie let it be known that he had never exactly seen his mother 's black bush ; that such joys he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her knockers was good or bad enough ; that they had lapped over her fat front like a pair of lathes , that they came down a good three inches below her navel ; that with the least little stooping she could use them for shoehorns ; that the nipples reminded him of cat shit or of what was on the bottom of enema bags ; that he wondered how his father ever laid eyes or anything else on her twat ; that she most likely had to first piss and give him a clue ; that along with her other delights she was an open prober of nose and navel ; that her belches could keep a zeppelinaloft ; that she was in general and in every particular a slob ; that if they did her in the movies she would be played by Wallace Beery ; that the moment his father started shaving was the moment she spread herself on the toilet seat ; that she smelled of wet mops and old vaseline ; that she seemedp82to have the rag on every Monday and Thursday ; that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and back ; that she was continually rubbing zinc ointment into her chapped and blotchy thighs ; that after this rubbing she would sniff her fingers , then her armpits , then her bloomers ; that when he considered these odors , singly or in amalgam , he cleansed himself by thoughts of gargling with shit. ... with loose shit , " Boomie finished up . " Loose shit , " Simon said languorously . " Yummy , yummy , yummy , yum . " " Loose . . . green ... dribbly shit-t-t . " Boomie let out his tongue and sucked in saliva . " Plippy , ploppy , plyuchy shit from Hymie 's bubbee 's asshole , guhshy , wuhshy shit with hair on it . " Marshall , to show he was of their humor , leered awfully and did a " Vomit . Slishy , glishy , pishy , snotty , and with .. . scumonit ! " Whereupon Boomie looked at Simon , saying , " Hey , right ball ! " And Simon looked at Boomie , answering , " Hey , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the samesociable , good-natured tone recited , " WHO 'S THAT PRICK IN THEMIDDLE ! " And both together moved suddenly and grabbed and squeezed . And Marshall fought them off with soft , girlish slaps , and he called them fucks and fairies and fairy-fucks . And while he was cupping his crotch Hymie tweaked his nipples and growled , " So ? " Marshall gave back the same " So ? " " So ? So . So so so . " Marshall made a dumb show of threading and stitching . " Your turn , " said Hymie , and " You go . " Marshall was snipping thread.  | " We went , now you go , " Hymie said righteously . " Your turn , you hafter . . . " " I hafta ? Wakiner hafta ? I doan hafta and wherezit written I hafta . " Hymie slouched forward and banged his brows , going " Wowed " and " Zaddafuck , waddafuck !

" " Is your dick big enough to touch your ass ? " Boomie was honestly curious . " Doan hafta worry , " Marshall told the yahrzeit lamps . " You hafta worry , you wan na worry , worry about your dick , you got more to worry ... " " That 's not a fair question ? Thatza fair question , so answer . Answer ! " Boomie said . " Zit big enough to touch your ass ? " " Big enough , " Marshall told the potted plants . " So go fuck yourself . " " Know anything about hockey ? " Marshall returned . " Yeah , yeah , puck you , " Boomie finished . " And you 're a real fucking baby . Because .

" Kaddishp84he has to do . Ya fuck around with Kaddish , that 's doing a sin . " " BuY CONDRUMS ! " Hymie screamed . " In the Silver Rod and when it 's jammed . " " JAMMED ! " Simon screamed also . " And to wait on him there 's only only a lady ! " " I . . . got ... a ... better penalty . " And Boomie snarled , " Showusyourdick ! " " The only one who never never did , " said Simon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted as though dealing with smoke in his eyes . " Name me one time , " said Simon . " One time , I hafta name you one time , okay , sure I 'll name you one time .

" Youare so so so fulla shit , wowee , it 's coming outta your ears ! " " I 'm fulla shit ? Sure . If I 'm fulla shit what are you ? " " You know what about Fay Wray ? " Hymie reflectedp85darkly . " They put her in parts where they always wan na do it to her . Like in King Kong . " Boomie murmured , " Oy oy oy , mine Marshalleh god hah shlong like King Kong . " " He took it out !

Sure ... " There was silence for quite a while . Then Boomie rose and winked at Simon ; and Simon rose and made signs to Hymie ; and Hymie rose and patted his chest and got busy picking a scab off an elbow ; and Simon moved in on Marshall 's left side ; and Hymie moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first against Marshall'sright side and then against his left side and when Marshallwas out of position Boomie dipped between his legs ; and Simon and Hymie tickled and pinched under his armpits and around his nipples ; and though Marshall cried " Fuck off !

" ; and Hymie shouted " Tick-tock , we want the cock ! " ; and Marshall , giggly and in a baby voice said , " Eheheheheh " and " Meheheheh , " and shut his eyes and squeezed and quivered as though straining on a potty and whimpered " Mah-hommy " ; and Marshallfollowed this with a " Mommy-Mommy " ; and then Marshall'svoice went off in six directions ; and very soon he saidp86in his own voice and with strange regularity , " Ma . . . Ma ... Ma . . . Ma " ; and he seemed no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon and Hymie let up on him ; and they laughed , largely from astonishment ; and Marshallcaught his breath and locked it against his palate and pretended that he had all along sought to deceive them ; and Boomie and Simon and Hymie whooped with laughter to show that they had not been at all deceived but that in seeking to practice such deceit Marshall had violated a trust and merited from them much more meanness ; and that Marshall had willed this meanness in something like the same way that Laurel willed Hardy 's smacks and smashes ; and when Marshall sought to raise himself from the rug they pushed him down ; and Marshallpushed back , but carefully and with less force ; and Marshallclamped his thighs together and grabbed his groin and called , " Mommy , come to the window , " and " Mommy , they 're starting up with me " ; and Boomie answered him with a " Marshelleh , dun bodder deh mommy ven she 's gedding herself some nice fuxing " ; and Marshall laughed inordinately at this ; and Boomie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belch but farted instead ; and Simon and Hymie ran right away and opened the windows and while at the windows sang Lulu Had a Baby into the air shaft ; and Boomie started Marshalllaughing again with his " Marshelleh " ; and Hymie dug into Marshall 's thigh and twisted the fatty part ; and Simon gave him a two-fingered slice right under his testicles ; and all three talked over his head . SIMON : Let 's let 's pull out his cock hair . HYMIE : Three atta time . BOOMIE : He got only three . IIYMIE : How about the ball hairs . The **47;11426;TOOLONG : He got no balls .

You gave me two , sure you gave metwo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And fuck you , too . BOOMIE ( suddenly jumps up and stiffens and quavers ) : Mrs. H-h-herberg , hello , hello , Mrs. Herberg . All present are startled , then all present pretend to be showingoff their open flies . Marshall goes over to Hymie and stands around flexing his fingers , massaging his right fist , andp89stroking Hymie 's arm , saying , " Boff ! " Hymie mouths a " Two " and holds up two fingers . Marshall mouths a " Fuck you " and holds up four fingers . Boomie argues against four boffs on the same arm and in the same spot . Simon suggests two boffs on each arm and in the same spot , and Boomie suggests four boffs on the same arm but in different spots . Marshall rolls up a sleeve and shows all present the green and yellow marks he bears yet from Hymie 's boffs . Hymie manfully cries " Fuck you , do four , do the four where ya want !

" , he bounds forward , and going " Boffee , boffee , boffee , boom , " he gives Hymie four high , soft , open-handed swats . Boomie and Simon laugh and laugh at the way Hymie gapes mutely . Simon sings " Two , four , six , eight , who do we appreciate ? " All present yell out the " Marshall ! " " He 's starting again his shit , " Hymie grumbled . " Schmuck , putzo , givim a chance !

" And to Marshall : " Waddaya starting the shit again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Simon . " That 's right . Sure , " Marshall muttered . " All he 's doing , he 's reading to her a hot book .

" And Marshall also upped his voice.  | " Your father , " Boomie hastily came in , " must be some fuckin reader . " Marshall made his back completely straight and still , locked fingers , centered his hands on an imaginary desk , and with maddening slowness once again began . " He put on the little night light , what they use only for Shabos , that 's what maybe woke me up , I say maybe ' because  --  because I can sleep usuallyif they got every light burning in the house .

Right ? That 's how my leg is going , and it wakes me up , and I hear my father . I hear him before I even notice the Shabos light is on , and I think the first thing I thought of on account of the way he was talking was he talking about how somebody died . He talked in the exact same way when he heard my zaideh died , like he 's  --  in shul and he 's dovinning and ya do it in a singsong : Geh-peh-meh , Poppa 's dead , it 's a dream and they 're kidding me , shmeh-beh-deh , waddaya talkingabout he 's dead , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what then , I know him , how I know him , reh-peh-peh-peh-peh , Poppa Poppa , you 'll surprise me , I betcha I betcha that 's what it is , zeh-zeh-zeh-deh-deh , I 'll go inside the shvitz , I 'm telling you because I know him , he 'll be taking it easy on the daybed . Oh boy , he 'll be fressing an egg and onion sandwich , ha-beh-beh-beh , and he 'll gim me the crust , the hard part , what then , he knows , you know how I love the crust , Poppa Poppa , keh-keh ... " ' .. leh-leh , " sang Boomie , " how about hot-tot parts ? " " ... shmeh-shmeh , " Simon picked up , " the hot hot hot parts ! " To which Marshall made reply , " You want hot parts ? You/kin get hot parts . Sure . Why not ? Ab-solutely . Sure . Ya know what to do ? I 'll tell ya what to do . What ya should do is  --  take your prick , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas range and  --  ya got a hot part . Right ? That 's right . " Simon went " Heh-heh-heh-heh . " Boomie made his head hang and his tongue protrude , and Hymie , straining forward between them , begged for one , only one zetss . Marshall did a spiteful " Ha-zeh-zeh-zeh , " then said , " I 'm getting to the hot part , gim me a chance , ya do n't gim me a chance , give a person a chance ... " Hymie , after looking high and low and back and forth , declaredthat he would always and anytime give a person a chance . A person .. Marshall said , " Zatso ? " Hymie said , " Zatso . " Marshall rose , raised his fists , and instructed Hymie to do the same . " I got one word for you , " said Marshall . Hymie , his back like a cat 's , begged for the word . " Ya want the word ? I 'll give ya the word . Sure . Why not ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would go and brought up an agonized constricted " Ma !

" Simon and Boomie and Hymie scooted to the window , and though Marshall pulled them by their belts and gave them slices and gooses , they nevertheless bloomed into song : In the shade of the old apple tree . It was there that she showed it to me . It looked like a dot , She called it her twatIn the shade of the old apple tree !  | " Okay . That 's it . I 'm finished . No more . Good-bye . Good luck . That 's it . " Marshall buttoned his fly and pointed to the door . " No no no guy has a fourteen-inch cock , " said Simon . " What he read to her , what I heard , " said Marshall . " That big , " announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ?  --  it 's like a ruler , a regular , ordinary ruler plus two inches . " Patiently , Marshall said , " The fourteen-inch part is the part I got exactly . Ya want me to swear I got everything exact ? Okay , sure , I 'll swear . That 's right ! Why not ! Ya want bull shit  --  I ' 11 give ya bull shit . " Through his hands , Marshall called out , " Hey , Daddy , hey read a little louder before ya fuck , I ca n't hear ! Sure . . . " " Do , kinya do that part again ? " Hymie asked . " I rammed my prick  --  her wet frothy cunt .. ' " I put lox in her box , " Boomie mused . " I put a match in her snatch . " " Rammed ' I 'm not sure , " Marshall said to Hymie . " I do n't want to be a bull-shit artist , I should n't say positively it was rammed because  --  because maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That 's right ! " Simon said , " Sure ... " " Like this , this is how it , like , went . " Marshall tapped his brows , shut his eyes , and chewed on his tongue . " Have you ever been fucked ? ' I softly asked or I asked softly . No , I am cherry , ' I was told , for I am something something something and something about my pussy , I have a small pussy and would something something get it hurt by a long , thick dick or a long , thick prick .

" " ' Do you something something possible for your long , thick dick or long , thick prick to fit into my small pussy ? Oh ... oh ... oh if it is only ... " " a ... your knees , " Simon said , " and even even to your knees it would n't be fourteen inches , not with a hardon . " " Fourteen inches . So ? So what 's so wonderful and what 's so hot about fourteen inches ? " Boomie demanded . " Yask me why I love that part "  --  Hymie chuckled  --  " I could n't tell why I love it .

" Marshall folded his arms . " How about my . . . " Simon waited and waited , then dove in under the laughter . " My seven , your six , and Marshey'sONE ! " " For-get it . It 's finished . Fuck you , " said Marshall . Simon went , " Heh heh . " Boomie pinched his nose and furiously fanned air.  |p94Hymie  blared , " Waddaya putting the stink on me ?

A mudder , she lays-uh only da fart . . . 1 " " In the middle of fucking she farts ! " Hymie did something delicate with his mouth . " How I know is she 's my mother . She 's my mother and I know how my mother farts . " " His-a mudder 's fart ! " exclaimed Boomie . " Betcha betcha he put it in the wrong hole . " And Hymie cackled a C. Henry Gordon cackle . " I-uh know-uh his-uh mudder 's fart , his-uh mudder 's fart , thassa his-uh grand-uh-fart ! " " Also how I know is my father laughed ... " " Sure he laughed . Sure , " said Boornie . " After all , they were farting around . " " Were they fucking when she farted ? " Hymie asked . " I think , " Marshall told him , " I 'm not sure , I think he was sucking on her tit . " " Which one ? " Hymie demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Which one ? " Hymie insisted in Marshall 's tone . " Which one ? All right , ya wan na know which one , I 'll tell ya which one . Sure . The middle one . " " Why I ask  --  know why I ask ? " " Sure I know . Why you ask is  --  you 're a schmuck . " " The left one you 're supposed to do it on , " Hymie explained . " ... supposed to do it on the left one so he was doing it on the left one , " Marshall conceded . " Why . . . not . " " Sure , " said Simon . " That 's right , " said Boomie . " When ya do it on the left one , " Hymie said with deter/mination , " it works on them , it 's supposed to work on them a certain way , it gets them hot in the box .

Ya wan na hear how she was hot in the box , listen to how she was hot . . . ! " " It got got on fire , " Simon speculated . " On fire , it got on fire , " Boomie kept going , " and your father hadda piss out the flames . " " That 's right ! " declared Marshall . And he settled into punitivesilence . " Teasing , " said Boomie . " Just just just kidding , " said Simon . " That-ss teasing ? " Marshall gazed at them sadly . " Okay , it 's teasing . To you , it 's teasing . To me . .. " " Marshey , hey , Marshey , " pleaded Hymie , " one more time , c'm on , again , I love it ! Her wet frothy .. : " " Definitely it 's teasing . Absolutely it 's teasing . Sure it 's teasing .

" I did n't did n't get that , " Simon said . " So long he took ? " Hymie moaned . " How long did he take ? " " Long , " answered Marshall . " That long , " Hymie mused . " I figured ...

" " Whakiner out ! " demand Boomie . " He hadda hadda cool it off ! " screamed Simon . " He hadda fill it like a fountain pen ! " Boomie screamed back . Firmly , deliberately , Marshall chanted , " In and out , in and out , and in and out . And my mother says , Oy . ' And my father says , Clara , I 'm hurting ya , something something , ' in Jewish . And my mother says , Lester , something something in Jewish , not hurting me , I felt a rip in the sheet , the Chink oughtta drop dead . ' And my father says , Nu .

" Boomie jabbed both index fingers at Marshalland started to giggle . " Do n't do n't see , " said Simon . " Schmuck , ya looking right at it . Right  --  at  --  it . Putzo ! " And Simon at last went , " Heh heh . " And Hymie yelled , " Makeim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling ! "  |p97And  capering and clapping hands all together yelled , " Marshey'sgodda hardon , Marshey 's godda hard-on ! " Marshall gave back a " Sure . Why  --  not ? Absolutely . " Though Marshall had called his " Chickee ! " in plenty of time they were still wet and wheezing when his parents marched in . " Never again , " said Mrs. Herberg . " This is it , " said Mr. Herberg . " No more , " said Mrs. Herberg . " Good-bye and good luck , " said Mr. Herberg . " Fifteen cents for their orange drink , " said Mrs. Herberg . " Sugar water , " said Mr. Herberg . " It first made me thirsty , " said Mrs. Herberg . " They wonder why the Jewish stage is dying , " said Mr. Herberg . " Marshelleh , it 's late , " said Mrs. Herberg . " I 'll say at least for the goyim , when they put on a show they give you a show , " said Mr. Herberg . " Marshelleh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hafta hafta hafta go , " said Simon . " Anyway I hafta go , " said Boomie . " Their music is music , their dancing is dancing and their acting is acting , " said Mr. Herberg . " Say good night to your boy friends , ask them if they want some sponge cake before they go , tell them tomorrow morningis another day , " said Mrs. Herberg . " I godda go because I godda get up early , I godda do something for my mother , " said Boomie . " The goyish shows do n't make a fool out of the public , " said Mr. Herberg . " I hafta bring a whole buncha shirts to the Chink , " said Boomie . " A whole whole whole bunch , " said Simon.  | " She likes how he does shirts , right Shimmy ? " said Boomie . " She says on shirts he does some some beautiful work , " said Simon . " Sheets she do n't give him , sheets he kills , she says on sheets all he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't say the goyim do n't give you dreck , but their dreck has at least a finesse , " said Mr. Herberg . " Your boy friends do n't mind , Marshelleh , they 're not insulted , they also got working people for parents , " said Mrs. Herberg . " Sure , " said Simon . " That 's right , " said Boomie . On the way home they went by the Neptune and hung around to watch the ushers setting up the billboards for King Kong . Hymie said that in some parts he looked big and in some parts he looked small . Simon wondered how it was that they show you King Kong naked but they never show on him a cock . Boomie told them he had seen the picture three times already and all three times he was disappointed that when Kong gets loose in the city he does it hardly any damage , only one train he wrecks a little . Hymie claimed he was bothered always by something else , not that it was so important , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives on his island , they never show you where he lives exactly . Simon recalled that in the part where he takes Fay Wray the first first time he takes her up a cliff and by a cave , so it must be you 're supposed to realize he lives in caves . Boomie gave them to understand that if he got a nickel , only a nickel for every time he had pulled off on Fay Wray'stits in that part the Depression would be over.  |p99Hymie  also used Fay Wray in that part , but only to start himself off because he liked to go usually from her tits to Ruby Keeler 's legs and finish on the part in Tarzan Finds His Mate where Johnny Weismuller saves Maureen O'Sullivan from crocodiles and when they come out the water he 's holding her by the ass . Simon speculated how someday the Battle Aces might end up all together in Hollywood and in Hollywood they might go to a party and at this party there would be a bunch a bunch of actresses and Fay Wray and Maureen O'Sullivan would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be Anne Shirley for him and these actresses would have to shake their hands . This made them so crazy with laughter that they lurched all over the sidewalk and bumped into Nutsy Irving 's newsstandand he came after them with his iron bar saying , " Dogs should have to come and throw cold water on you ! "  |p101Then  on the early afternoon of Wednesday , February 15 , 1936 , the week Teitlebaum ran this sign : " Forget about bringingback the N.R.A . but do n't forget to start bringing back the Sheffield empties " ; not so long after Mrs. Raphael , meaning to put some luck money in the new pocketbook of Shirley , her middle daughter , fished out a crucifix and a mimeographedpostcard confirming an appointment with a Father O'Herlihy ; when the neighborhood was still talking and talking about how the Hi-Ho Casino had announced the star of Hell 's Angels and then brought out not Jean Harlow but Ben Lyon to tell a few jokes and sing a lousy Eli , Eli ! ; and about how Dopey Duhvee had for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life with a fountainpen point ; when Mrs. Lampel claimed that Dr. Ringelman , after a cleaning , had kissed her on the mouth and told her he was from now on specializing in women 's cavities ; the day after Hymie 's bubbee started throwing dimes and quarters out the window and promising plenty more to any Jewish heart who would get word to President Roosevelt that her daughter gave her no sugar cubes to suck ; the same general time certain dark forcesp102sought to take the secret of Eonite from Daddy Warbucks and Pop Jenks was in danger of losing the Sugar Bowl and Madam Zenda had Bim Gump out of his mind from drugs and terrible beatings ; when Mrs. Aranow told how her Stanley had picked up in his taxi a pleasant little woman near Ohrbach 's and taken her all the way to the Bronx ; how he kept telling her she looked familiar , how she laughed and laughed and at the end of the ride let him know she was Milton Berle 's mother ; when Mrs. Vogel definitely spotted the brother she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bette Davis in Front Page Woman ; when Mister George the Beautician sold out to the electrolysis parlor upstairs and went back to work for others ; after Mrs. Menashim found out , never mind how , that by shtupping Gelfman 's brother-in-law a ten-dollar bill her Howie could be fixed up in the post office for the summer months ; after Yenta Gersh was tossed out of the Isaac Gellis because she had once too often pestered customersfor used tea bags ; after the new landlord at 1894 Brighton 3rd notified all tenants by registered letter that starting with the first of next month absolutely nothing could be stored in the basement ; right when a seltzer bottle exploded in Mrs. Holtzberg 's bathroom ; a week or so since Mrs. Jacobey sent her letter to the " Voice of the People " in the Daily NewsThis is to conductor number A1oo4 or A1ooq , I did n't have my glasses , who played dumb when I rang the bell for my stop next and lets say even it wasnt my stop there was a red light he went right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off getting off conductornumber A1oo4 or A1oo9 played dumb and not only he did nt stop on Brighton 5 where believe me I was far from the only person getting off , here 's what he did , he went very fast to Neptune Ave , that 's four short blocks and three AVENUE blocks from Brighton 5 , and then first conductor number Az004 or A1oo9 made ap103stop it was a wonder I did nt re-break my hip  --  no wonderwe still got the Depressionwhen right near Judge Leibowitz 's house in Manhattan Beach an eagle or a very large sea gull was seen ; Simon 's mother and Mrs. Plaut and Mrs. Harlib were on their stoop catching the last sun and passing around a Photoplay and half-a-Modern Screen . " Since I heard he came out against Roosevelt , " Simon 's mother was saying , " I have very very very little use for Adolph Menjou .

" Ricardo Cortez , " answered Simon 's mother . " Irving  --  Shif cart , " Mrs. Harlib hissed . " He and Ricardo Cortez are supposed to be so one and inseparable "  --  Mrs. Plaut moved herself onto Mrs. Harlib 's newspaper  --  " they made a seder together .

" They get fancy , they forget their old pals , they want  --  to be  --  ah-lone . " " Hoo hoo ! " cried Simon 's mother .

At the fire escape four floors above Gelfman where a small but fattish man in T-shirt and black felt slippers scaled the railing , worked a foot and half his behind into the fretwork , and stared stupidly down . He at last yelled , " Hello , hello , hello ! , " waving an arm and flapping a slipper . " Sol Merz , M , E , R , Z , rhymes withschmerz , AM I TALKING LOUD ENOUGH ?

He made a motion as though to salute Mrs. Chepper but somehow botched it . A second later Dopey Duhvee had caught one of his slippers . " I ca n't ca n't ca n't watch .

The only reason I mentioned Street Scene is that it 's a little little little bit like Street Scene because Street Scene also has a person on a fire escape and he 's also like in the clothing line and she 's also in it , she plays some beautiful part , with the Chinkee eyes , Sylvia Sidney . " " Sylvia  --  Dietz . Or Dietzer , " Mrs. Harlib hissed . " Is it me or is it Sylvia Sidney ? " asked Mrs. Plaut . " I used to like her , I used to have with Teitlebaum the biggest argumentsbecause he would say she has a certain little habit he could n't stand , a little something she does with her pisk . " " That 's a pisk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pisk . " " That that that 's a piskeleh , " said Simon 's mother . " Testing testing , " Merz began . " Baruch shaym k'vood , the music goes round and round . " " Bah-bah-bah mitzvah , " went Dopey Duhvee , spitting at his mother 's breasts . " Shm'ah Yisroel , again testing , wan na buy a duck , " Merz sang.  | " Coming over , creamed spinach , you said to remind you , " Mrs. Chepper sang back . " Every two Mondays , " said Merz , " our local holds what we call  --  a procedure meeting ... " " Solly , " his wife croaked , " you 'll get a police record . " From the babushka : " Follows you all your life . " .. during a procedure meeting we discuss , like  --  procedures . " " Tell him if I 'm a liar , " his wife appealed to the crowd , " tell him if they 're not very strict when they see somebody , he 's blocking a fire escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the babushka affirmed . " On account of the meeting is after work and it can be sometimes a two- , three-hour proposition and we get hungry , our local has a custom started by our manager ... " From the boardwalk : " Abe Elkin , right ! " " Right ! " Merz answered . From the boardwalk : " A prince ! " " Also right ! " Merz answered . " Tell him how he 'll be in real trouble , " his wife implored , " how you dass n't have on the fire escape even a galosh . " " You want a government job , it 'll go against you , " the babushka warned . " On this particular Monday , " Merz picked up , " we had a really nice , an exceptional meeting . We took into the union three of the temporaries , they chipped in together for shnapps and cookies , and we voted a three-dollar assessment to help out toward when a member in good standing has like a situationthat after an illness of no less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalized , and upon the written advisement from the doctor that a recuperating rest is demandedand called for by the state of his health , the member in good standing should get up to  --  here up to means the . . . most  --  twelve-fifty a week for the first three weeks he 's away ... "  |p110A  storm of applause broke from the boardwalk . Merz waved , swayed , caught himself , and over the concussionof a train said something about progressive trade unionism and good leadership . " What I got against Sylvia Sidney , " Simon 's mother was bringing out , " is the same same thing I got against George Arliss : They both take parts where they play up too too much to the goyim . " " A message from the missus ! " the babushka yelled . " Hold one second ! " " You never never see her in a picture without a cross , " said Simon 's mother . " Without the cross she ca n't move . " Now Mrs. Merz appeared , saying , " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rest assured , " said Simon 's mother , " you would n't see a Nancy Carroll or a Sally Eilers or a Patricia Ellis with a Mogen Dovid . They hold by their religion and that 's why , they should drop dead , I give them the highest highest highest credit and I respect them and I admire them . " The babushka , snapping fingers , cried , " Another few words from the missus ! " And Mrs. Merz announced , " The operator gives back the nickel . Something goes wrong , God forbid , they mail stamps . " " Stamps you can always use , " the babushka added . " In the movies , " said Mrs. Harlib , " I love how they 're alwaysusing the phone . The least little nothing and it 's long distance . " " Hey , hey , you 're listening there ? " Merz wanted to know . " Do n't you worry , " Mrs. Chepper answered him . " I 'm listening . I 'm interested . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no favors . Because I can go right away inside and take a little gas . " Merz stuck out his tongue and took short , gasping breaths .

" " If I do n't jump  --  if , " Merz told her , " you 're going to have to make it your business to come up the house . " Mrs. Chepper beamed . " Anytime . " " Today is no good , " Mrs. Merz called harshly . " Could you use number-nine trimmings ? Whether you can use it or not you 'll help yourself to number-nine trimmings . " And Merz added passionately , " You know what kind of trimmingsnumber-nine trimmings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard from the boardwalk . " Tell them "  --  Mrs. Merz beckoned to the babushka  --  " why today is out . " " The missus did n't shop yet , " the babushka piped promptly . " She got an empty icebox . " " I feel for her , " said Simon 's mother . " I 'm also also the type that has to has to shop every day . " " Later , if there 's a later , " Merz said happily , " I 'll tell you what kind a hostess I got , that when my brother came in from Jersey for a visit , I 'm talking about from way out in Jersey , and he said to her , Okay , Sweetheart , what 's in the icebox ?

" Right away it 's my fault , you notice I 'm the bad one , give it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamented Mrs. Merz . " Becausehis brother has sugar blood and I did n't want to open the icebox , he should see there Hershey 's Kisses . " " Bring out , " snapped the babushka , " how by you nothing ever came easy .

" But Merz was whistling , whistling and waving . " Hey , lady lady , not you , next to you , with the two seltzer bottles . . . . " " That 's Mrs. Ratzkin , " said Mrs. Chepper. " ... hands off , stay away from the fire alarm , and do n't monkey with my nerves ! " " Bella , " Mrs. Chepper called over , " you got time with alarms .

" " Ebbing is the word , ebbing , ebbing , " crooned Merz , " the strength is ebbing , Gelfman move your stand a little , you do n't need my blood on your papers ... " " If you get a chance , that 's if if you get a chance , " Simon 's mother said to Mrs. Plaut , " you 'll save me the Mirror . " The people 's flag is deepest red , It 's shrouded oft their martyred dead . Merz sang in a sobbing voice . And from the boardwalk : When their blood grows thick and cold , The rest I do n't remem-ber-ber .. . Workers , workers , Do n't be shirkers !  |p113Mertz  belted out nicely . Then he shook a fist and said , " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony , maybe the Pantsworker wants to put in a few words . . . " And from the boardwalk : " For this week forget it ! " " ... could say that the industry and the trade mourns and regrets the passing and the loss of a brother and a fellow worker , a staunch and a loyal trade-union man , a fighter and a militant , an old Socialist and . . . " " Socialist you do n't have to put in , " cried Mrs. Chepper . " Also , you 're not so old . " " They can say  --  hold on  --  it 's written down  --  that in 1922 the bosses cracked my head  --  I made a few reference notes  --  do n't get restless  --  " Merz dug into his watch pocket . " Brother and fellow worker you had  --  fighter and militant you had  --  " Merz pinched out a piece of envelope .

" With your mouthpiecelet Boake Carter worry . " " Did I cover , let 's see if I covered "  --  Merz brought his head down and his envelope up  --  " assessment , that it was unanimouslypassed and approved , that it relieves and eases the sick and the needy ? " From the boardwalk : " In my local you do n't see that ! " " Did I make clear and explain that it takes care of up to five eye-doctor visits ? An eye doctor , " he emphasized , " is not an optometrist . An eye doctor you can go to when you want glasses and also when you do n't want glasses . "  |p114And  again from the boardwalk : " In my local they wo n't even make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is it everybody ? " mused Mrs. Plaut . " But if somebody says Tom Mooney , I hear Paul Muni . " " Muni  --  Weisenfreund , " Mrs. Harlib hissed . " My Shmuel has one one one complaint with Paul Muni , " said Simon 's mother . " You 'll say to him Paul Muni ' and he 'll answer you , Paul Muni , he chakehs . ' " Only when he 's with Ann Dvorak , " Mrs. Harlib declared . " With an Ann Dvorak you have to chakeh . " " You 'll notice , I do n't know if you noticed "  --  Mrs. Plaut squeezed each of them on an elbow  --  " how Muni never played together with Pat O'Brien . Not even in the same ComingAttractions . " " Move in , get close , " were Merz 's next words . " Hold on and stay patient because I promise , you 'll see that on account of Sol Merz nobody  --  nobody will miss Myrt and Marge . " " Grah grab grah ! " warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrt and Marge , " his mother advised . " He lives for Myrt and Marge . " " Excuse me , overlook it , " Merz said amicably .

" Merz tore off a snip of his paper . " Good and welfare , to hell with it . " Merz tossed away the rest of his paper . " Anyway , without no more  --  without  --  what Eddie Cantor says when he wants to introduce Rubinoff . " " Without further ado , " Mrs. Chepper prompted . " Used to be now without further ado . " " For things like that , " Merz told her , " I had an iron head . You 'd say to me  --  you 'd say Rudy Vallee ' and I 'd say Rudy Vallee , my time is your time .

" " Hey hey , what 's doing with Marge 's Ed ? " Mrs. Harlib demanded . Simon 's mother whimpered and bit a knuckle . " It looked so good , " Mrs. Harlib mused . " He was nearly finished in the hospital , he was getting his memory again .. " " A lost cause , " Simon 's mother said bitterly . " The one the one who used to be Just Plain Bill 's Nancy pushed herself in. " .. the doctor was so pleased with him , he was putting him on broth . " " Marge is going now with a boy , he 's got a name "  --  Simon 's mother swallowed her lips  --  " Listen listen listen to this for a name , you 'll break your teeth on it , the way the goyim have names , you have to have to listen to a name : Tom  --  Fenwick ! " So let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pie , Merz half-sang , half-sobbed . For a second or two he hummed , keeping time with nervous hands , then said , " That 's what he was singing , our manager , and that 's the swell mood he was in from the meeting . We got such a kick out of him with his mood we started to carry on , we gave him , like  --  a razzing . I would n't say a razzing , I 'll say a little kibbitz . Maxie Schiller made believe he was playing the violin and I myself , I said to him , Listen , Mister Manager , by union leaders you 're a union leader , but I 'm going to tell you that by chazins  --  by chazins you 're no chazin . ' He says , Boys , I want to put over a point . ' He even stands up , to show he 's going to put over a point . In the labor history story we 're a pip-squeak and they do n't know from us .

I hurl back these burning words because tonight we have done here a definitely noble purpose in that quietly , quietly and without no fanfare , we took affirming action to put on the history-book record what the late Daniel De Leon  --  I do n't have to tell you who he is and how he stands with me  --  if he had only lived on a little bit longer  --  ' " And from the boardwalk : " That was a loss . That was  --  a loss ! " " ' This labor statesman , this giant , this silver tongue used to have a certain expression , and his expression was  --  A Noble Act . ' " And again from the boardwalk : " A noble act or a noble piece of action ! " " So how about it , what do you say we celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingo bango , the motion was carried , we went downstairs and without "  --  Merz paused , caught Mrs. Chepper 's eye and smiled  --  " without further ado we went downstairs and our manager took us over in three taxis to the Paramount Cafeteria and he treated his boys to what Merz happens to love , it 's called protose steak . . . " " He did n't let the missus know ! " yelped the babushka . " I waited for him a little under two hours and ten minutes where the express has a middle exit by the broken scale , " Mrs. Merz cried gloriously . " Three times she fainted , " the babushka filled in . " A motorman had to pinch her under the neck . " Merz whistled , waited . " The protose steak , " he said at last , " entitled you to two vegetables . One could be a raw vegetable , one could be a not raw vegetable . Vegetable one was no problem , vegetable one for Merz has to be a cucumber . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no meal without a cucumber . "  | " Hey hey , you 're a Galitzianerl " Mrs. Chepper chuckled . " Right ? " Merz locked fingers and waved like a happy prizefighter . " Touch a Galitzianer and you 're holding a cucumber , " Mrs. Chepper told the crowd . " It 's an old saying . " " Scratch a Litvak and you 're peeling radishes , " Merz countered happily . " It 's a Sol Merz saying . " He allowed a little laughter but cut off the " Hooray for our side ! " " Vegetablenumber two , " he said soberly , " was a  --  different story . To save my life , if they came to me with a hundred-dollar offer to pick that second vegetable I  --  could  --  not  --  do it ! And meanwhileI 'm holding up the line . And meanwhile all the boys are sitting down already . And meanwhile my protose steak is getting ice cold . Then , by coincidence , if it happened in the movies you 'd say , Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second they wheel out from the kitchen a wagon and the wagon has on it one tray and one vegetable . And without further ado "  --  he blew a kiss at Mrs. Chepper  --  " I say to the vegetable lady , To hell with it , give me that vegetable for my second vegetable ! ' That vegetable was  --  I do n't need totell you  --  CREAMED SPINACH ! " " Grab grah grab , " went Dopey Duhvee , and he made a muscle . " Is this a kid or is this a kid ! " cried his mother . " He hears a spinach , right away he has to sing the Popeye song . " " Usually  --  usually spinach is for me "  --  Merz pinched his lower belly  --  " it has an effect  --  bingobango , immediately . . . " " Also , me too , also ! Except "  --  Mrs. Chepper snapped a thumb at her throat  --  " me it gives heartburn . " Merz , after prescribing weak tea and a few bites of old roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear with "  --  he sniffled back the start of tears , sucked air  --  " Merz 's life  --  on the radio  --  you 'd get static ... " " Grab grah grah ! " went Dopey Duhvee . " You know why he 's angry , " his mother let the crowdp118know . " When he sings the Popeye song he loves you should sing with him . " Now Merz 's voice rang as he said , " I fell on that creamed spinach  --  oh , oh , did I fall on it ! Even my manager noticed , what does n't he notice , and he himself without saying a word , he went back  --  this is a guy who dass n't move too much , moving is for him poison  --  and he bought me a plate of only creamed spinach . . . " From the boardwalk : " My paskudnyak manager would also do that ! " " ... that plate I finished off  --  oh , oh , oh , did I finish it off ! In fact , my manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up already and I told him , What are you doing , do n't you dare , your boys need you , the labor movement needs you , sit where you are !

" " I got home and the first thing I said , here 's the exact words or I should n't live to jump off this fire escape , open the quotes : Liba , I want you to once a week make me the cooked vegetable I ate tonight in the Paramount Cafeteria , it 's called  --  ' " " He walks in without a Hello , " commented the babushka. "  --  creamed spinach , ' close the quotes . " " You cook for him , " the babushka said glumly , " you can plotz . " " If I give him hard-boiled egg , " lamented Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . " " After I close that quote she picks up the butter dish , she hands it to me , and she says , open the quotes , Stab me , ' close the quotes , and I never heard from her again for nine days by the calendar . " " He does n't tell you he took the butter dish , " the babushka pointed out . " It shows what was in his heart . "  | " I 'm not even counting that same night , if I counted that same night it would come to almost ten days . " " It do n't interest him that maybe the missus had other things on her mind . " And the babushka withdrew . " I had on my mind other things , " Mrs. Merz came in . " I had erev Pesach to worry about , that 's when I take out all the dishes from my closet and I clean it around and I put in brand new oilcloth . " " Vei , I feel for the woman . " Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to undertake the oilcloth is a terribleproposition . " Mrs. Harlib said , " I would do her oilcloth if she would do my camphorizing . " " The oilcloth I do n't mind , the camphorizing I do n't mind , " Mrs. Plaut reflected . " It 's when I have to go through my wire hangers . If I have an enemy I would wish on my enemy she should be healthy , she should have it very good , she should know from good luck and good luck only , and once a week she should have to go through my wire hangers . " Now Merz wept openly and with all his might . A " Three " sprang out of him as if it had been sneezed out , and he pulled at his hairs and he nodded and nodded . " Go ahead , good for you ! " his wife grumbled . " Get a cold ! " " He do n't get colds , " the babushka spat out . " He gets chest colds ! " " My three biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered .

" " Go know you like Liberty . I 'll give you a pile "  --  Mrs.p120Chepper brought her hand up and up and up  --  " like this a pile . " " Do n't do the missus no favors , " said the babushka .

" Peanut crackers  --  by some candy stores they 're peanut thins . Anyway , peanut crackers or peanut thins was my small pleasure numbertwo . " Mrs. Chepper tapped her head . " Rely on yours truly .

" Was reading Coal is King or King Coal and I took in also Whither the Needle Trades . I wanted to finish up Whither the Needle Trades because it was first of all more along my lines of interest and the library had it stamped a one-week book . " From the boardwalk : " What do you say , should I read it ? " " Skim through it , " answered Merz . " I brought it in with me that night mostly because I was curious , I was highly interested what it would have about Sidney Hillman . And I walk into the bathroom . And I grab hold the string . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on . " He strained toward the roof . " The bulb you put in for me  --  those fifteen watts  --  they should have to use it to wash down your body .

" Peanut crackers "  --  Mrs. Chepper clapped hands  --  " or peanutthins ! " " Peanut crackers , " mused Merz , " we 're on peanut crackersor peanut thins , yeah yeah , Merz , dark is your world , you should have paid the twenty-five dollars  --  in those years they charged only twenty-five dollars  --  that before you stoodp121under the chupeh with her the gangsters should 've broken on you  --  it did n't have to be a leg  --  a nice little ankle bone . . .

" " A Stromberg-Carlson , twenty-two tubes , they made it you have to burn the whole twenty-two tubes .

" And Merz climbed immediately down from the fretwork , paused to pop in his bridge , then sank to his knees before his window . Where he heaved and strained and pressed and threw around his weight and pummeled with a fist and with the flat of his hand , saying " Once it 's closed  --  I begged her  --  tip the fifteen cents  --  call in the . . .

" Only listen and pay a little attention to the Jewish kids of today ... " " Today 's Jewish kids , " Zwerkel confirmed . " The Jewish kids of today are the worst Hitlers .

Then Simon instructed Boomie and Hymie and Marshall to kiss pinkies and to swear what he swore : That nothing dirty would be heard from them , though their mouths were filled with S , H , I , T ; and that from now on they must use only the cleanest cleanest cleanest of words . And Simon had just started them off with a Rinso , when a dreadful draft tore off Steinbrink 's yarmalka and fluttered the pilot light in Zwerkel 's grill . " Merry Kratz mir and gut shabos .

He gazed slowly up and down and across the street , then shut the door noiselessly , then gave the street a last long look , then tapped his lips and shook his head. ... is not for you . " " I 'll say to you what God said to the Wir-gin Mary , " said Madam Ducoff . " When she told him she wanted a girl . Nisht bahshert .

" asked Zwerkel , " you look so , so ... " Madam Ducoff laughed mirthlessly . " I 'll say to you like the Mad Russian says to Eddie Cantor : Shell I tell him ? " She removed her coat , two sleeveless sweaters , opened the mismated buttons of a cardigan , and peeled off her chest some folded newssheets . " You maybe have what I sometimes have , " said Steinbrink . " And when that grabs you that can grab you ! " said Zwerkel . Madam Ducoff made her small eyes smaller , answering , " What it is is what you once in a while get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark powers , the finsternish , the mystery from mysteries , the number from numbers  --  a whole business . " " Talking from numbers . . . " Steinbrink squinted and wet his lips as if threading a needle . " What what comes after seventy-five ? " Simon shot at Marshall . " Speaking from numbers ... " " What comes after seventy-five ? I 'll tellya what comes after seventy-five . Seventy-six ! " " That that that 's the spirit ! " At which Zwerkel gave fair warning : " Buy or bye-bye . " And Madam Ducoff said to them , " I 'll tell you what the angel told Jacob . When they did wrestling . In my time I handled tougher . "  | " You mentioned numbers , " said Steinbrink airly . " So how about a number ? For a kopsin that 's without one little hit , it 's already , it 's already  --  I 'll tell you how long  --  seventeen weeks !

" Does n't have to be an exact number , " Steinbrink was wheedling . " Approximate is also good . " " With approximate , " said Zwerkel , " you can be better off than with exact . " " That 's a very good number , " Simon could be heard saying . " That that that 's a hot number ! " " A word . One word , maybe , " Steinbrink coaxed . " An approximate word , " muttered Zwerkel . " The best best number is  --  " Simon began . And all four blared : " Sixty-nine ! " " Beautiful . Gorgeous . Keep up , keep up . " Madam Ducoff swayed in her seat . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him , Let my people go ! ' You got me in a very bad mood . " Then to Steinbrink she murmured hoarsely , " To give a number ... " " In you and Roosevelt  --  one confidence , " Steinbrink whispered . " . . . I need get from you a dream . " " To save my life . . . " Steinbrink shrugged with one shoulder . " You dreamed , I 'll tell you what you dreamed , here 's what you dreamed "  --  Madam Ducoff raised her arms , then touchedp134Steinbrink over the heart  --  " you dreamed  --  a flying dream . " Steinbrink moaned , Zwerkel went , " Pooh-pooh . " " You flew "  --  Madam Ducoff dragged at the air  --  " should I say ? " " Is this something or is this something ? " said Steinbrink . " I want to tell you , " said Zwerkel . " She is  --  something . " " You flew in your flying dream , I 'll say  --  what I 'll say is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let 's say you was n't  --  too dressed up . " " This is , " Steinbrink marveled , " without question . . . " " No question about it , " said Zwerkel . Madam Ducoff with a soft " Shah " dipped into both shoppingbags and swished around her hands . She next made two , three passes over the handles , quivered her jaw , and looked long into the far distance . " Sixteen , " she ultimately said . An instant later she added , " In combinations . " Simon nickered . Boomie said , " I hadda dream . . . " Hymie brayed . Marshall brayed and bit a palm . " Combinations , " Steinbrink reflected . " I like nine  --  and seven . . . " " Gives you a choice , " cried Zwerkel . " Say you do n't like nine and seven , you make it  --  twelve and four ! " " Duh , you know what , duh , Boomie ? " Simon was blaring . " When I , duh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Duh , you got , dub , one , duh , trouble . . . " " My trouble is , duh , when I wake up , dub , it 's very very HARD ! " " The kids of today , " said Steinbrink . " Today 's kids , " said Zwerkel . " I 'll say to you "  --  from behind an ear Madam Ducoff fetched a cigarette  --  " I 'll say to you what the elephant said to the mouse . " She shook out of her hair a fat woodenp135match . " When the mouse was making love on him : You know , you 're working on my nerves . ' " She struck the match , and in her rage broke off the head . " Hey , Marshey , " cried Boomie , " she needs a match . " " Giver a match , " ordered Hymie . " I hafta , " Marshall grumbled . And without much interest he mumbled , " Ya wan na match ? I 'll giveya a match . My ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Steinbrink , " is the way everything is . " " And the way everything is , " said Steinbrink , " is no good . " The door opened and pretty soon Zwerkel was dealing with the draft and a nice few customers . For a while the boys studied him silently , though once in a while calling , " Who got the next ? " and " Mustard , puddin' more mustard ! " Then , after Zwerkel enlisted Steinbrink and both had their hands full , Simon yelled for a cream soda ; and Boomie yelled for four glasses and eight straws ; and Hymie yelled for one frank , very well done and with sauerkraut ; and Marshall yelled for the frank to be cut in half , exactly in half , and for mustard to be on one , only one of the halves . The big-faced lady parked herself in Madam Ducoff 's booth and murmured , " Could you fit me today ? " Though she kept bleary , bitter eyes on her assorted cold cuts , Madam Ducoff said amiably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the way God put it to the Jews . When he was warning how they dass n't have no other gods : Look , I need the busi-ness . ' " " Before I forget "  --  Mrs. Udell clinked down two , three , four quarters  --  " I owe for a house call . " Madam Ducoff swished the coins into a shopping bag . " Was a night call , " she said , with a shy and stricken smile . " You were anyway in my building , " Mrs. Udell contended.  |p136Madam  Ducoff gazed at her sadly . " I 'll say to you what Moses said . When he came down Mount Sinai : Look where I had to shlep up . " Out of a knotted handkerchief Mrs. Udell extracted anothercoin . Handkerchief and coin vanished somewhere on Madam Ducoff 's person . " From a half-dollar , " said Mrs. Udell throatily , " I do n't get change ? " Madam Ducoff returned the handkerchief . Mrs. Udell blotted her eyes with it and began , " I 'm all set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the book . " " Ah ah , Lady "  --  cream soda sloshed out of Boomie 's mouth  --  " do n't call it qvitz ! " " I 'll tell you , " said Madam Ducoff , " what the rebbitsin told the Cossacks when they were dragging her from the bed : Do n't make me get up to you . " To Mrs. Udell she muttered , " The book , closing it up , you were making a very interestingpoint . " " Started in my sorrows , " Mrs. Udell reflected , " **27;11556;TOOLONG ago ... " Madam Ducoff said quietly , " I 'm off by that half-a-week.

Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need three trolleys . Later I find out "  --  Mrs. Udell momentarily gagged  --  " to travel from trolley number two to trolley number three you can travel only by taxi . " " This , " Madam Ducoff sighed , " I already knew . " She added , after a second , " The Schrafft 's I was n't  --  hundred per-cent. "  | " I 'll skip over , " Mrs. Udell went on , " to when he brought her to the house . She walks in , the first thing  --  immediately she kisses me .

' The bummikeh has next the brazen gall to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , Only God can help me now . " " Your dinner  --  for dinner you had . . . " Madam Ducoff shut her eyes and frowned with fearful concentration . " Eggs and onions . Chicken soup . Puppick . Helzel . Deckel . " She pressed on her brows , her lids . " The deckel  --  was on the slightly dry side . " Mrs. Udell cried out and stuck her face into her hands . " Deckel , " croaked Boomie . He whispered into Simon 's ear ; and Simon whispered into Hymie 's ear ; and Hymie , holding his nose , whispered into Marshall 's ear . " Also happened "  --  Madam Ducoff peered into a shopping bag  --  " with the guest  --  a accident . " Mrs. Udell seized and pinched Madam Ducoff 's hands . Boomie started , " Why is deckel  --  " then broke up . " You spilled on her  --  wait , wait ! " Madam Ducoff was breathing badly . " Maybe seltzer , maybe soup . " " Seltzer and soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like when "  --  Boomie 's index finger slashed the air diagonally  --  " you 're getting cir-cumcised ? " Marshall said , " All right ! Why is deckel ? " " Why why why is deckel like when you 're getting circumcised ? " Simon tilted back in his chair and pointed his face at Madam Ducoff . Boomie stamped his feet and beat on the table . " Because . . . it 's . . . a . . . JEWISH CUT ! "  | " I 'll say , I 'll say , " Madam Ducoff rumbled , " what the Queen of Sheba said . When they were telling her about King Solomon : I do n't like wise guys . " She seemed on the verge of more , but Mrs. Udell was now weeping vigorously , and it took wetted napkins and scalp massage to restore her . After two tries she burped and came to herself a little , saying , " For the right girl I would be a second mother . For the right girl I would turn over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the three-way bulb in the kitchen . For the right girl I would stock her up with what a little bride dreams in her heart : A hocking knife , sour salt , my certain polish to shine cut glass , rubberbands galore , two toaster covers , a sponge with a grip on it that you can never get your hands wet , a soap dish , rubber coasters , they 'll fit underneath any bed and the bed never slips , a brick from when Luna Park burned down , it 's the perfect right size to put underneath an ironing board . Who would care and who would count ; from an open heart an open hand . " She reared back , gripped her throat , and hiccuped softly . " Oh yeah , oh yeah , " she said tonelessly to herself . " You 're fixing me good already , bummikeh . Bummikeh , bummikeh , you 're finishing up what the Depression started . " She averted her face , at the same time popping something into her mouth . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turns . Every half-hour on the half-hour I need to suck a Turns . " " Ah tah tah tah tah tah , " went Boomie . Hymie sniffled and moaned . " She hasta hasta hasta suck on Turns , " Simon cued Marshall . " She  --  hasta ! Waddaya mean she  --  hasta ? " Marshall , working both lips without showing teeth , looked into his lap . " I 'll giver something better to suck on . " Flushing thickly , pushing her clodhoppers one at a time out of the booth , Madam Ducoff rose . " I 'll tell you "  --  Shep139resumed her seat  --  " I am telling you what the cow told the bull . When the bull was getting on the tenth time : I 'm gettingnow really sore . " " Twat ? " Simon cupped an ear . " Twat twat did she say ? " " I cunt hear , " answered Boomie . " What Jewish kids talk today , " said Steinbrink , " you can plotz . " " You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jewishkids . " At this , the boys ordered one knishe with four forks , half a half-sour tomato , one Mason Mint wrapped and in a double bag , and toothpicks from a fresh box . On separate checks . To her next client Madam Ducoff said , " Behind this world is another . By the end of that world is already world without end . " The woman , fiftyish but with Shirley Temple ringlets , shook in her shawl and murmured , " Right , right . " " You can have darkness and you can have the light that 's darker then darkness . " " That 's the whole trouble . " " Sometimes  --  only sometimes  --  you start in with the materialand you 're pretty soon dealing with the immaterial . You get into form and the next minute you got the form-less . " " The way it is so I wish it was n't so . " " You think that 's bad , wait , " said Madam Ducoff . " What about when you look into one thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out !  --  that in this one thing is the beginning of all things and in the beginning of all things is where there 's no beginning . " " Tell me what I do n't know . " " I hear stuff , I can get cases "  --  Madam Ducoff indicatedp140her shopping bags  --  " tears your heart out . Comes to me , not so long ago , a little woman , a real rachmones . Her husband was having some trouble with one of the demons , I forget exactly who , whether it was Asherludtz or Pirpick , I would have to look up . " " They had that a lot in Sea Gate . " " Before I even walked in the house the first thing I did  --  this was the first thing !  --  I tried to make the husband comfortable , he should n't have such a sore spirit .

" " I did what I always do for a sore spirit . I played it safe , I did n't hurry-hurry , I . . . took . . . my time . I got through to the vital powers  --  that 's how I do things  --  I raised up Sharetanikand Hodretzoh , I heard what they had to say . " " With them you never go wrong . " " I did n't need pentagrams . I did n't need anagrams . " Madam Ducoff narrowed her face cunningly . " I fixed up a nice little charm , I put in it the Seal of Solomon , I waited till it was Saturday and I said what you 're supposed to say , Norporetz , Testardoff , Maragamid . ' " " You used your common sense . " " Then I made the house visit , I did a couple tests , I raised up Sharetanik and Hodretzoh again and even so  --  even so I was n't a hundred percent satisfied . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I checked three times his horoscope . I looked up in the zodiac , and to show you how I take a case serious  --  on account of I 'm one of the few people in the line who seldom uses them  --  I even dealt out a couple hands of Tarot cards . " " What could hurt ? " " But once I made up my mind I got right away on the job and I fixed up a regular on-the-dot course of treatment . Noth/ing fancy , nothing hocus-pocus . Plain , simple , the way they handled sore spirits before me , the way they 'll handle sore spirits after me . I used the double three instead of the single six ... " " The best thing . " ... and I right away put myself in a harmony with the fish of the fire , the goats of the earth , and the snakes of the water . Then I first fasted a little , I put myself in a coma , and I got through  --  yoish , till you get through  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to catch in the right mood . " " From Beramalud and Gozreh I had my hands full . In fact , they absolutely would n't come until I made a special fast and a special coma and even so I had to plead with Tabak . " " He saw you were good natured , he took advantage . " " It 's all in there , " Madam Ducoff lighted a cigarette and bounced massive smoke rings against her shopping bags . " How I had to find the secret of secrets , the principle of principles , the key to the lock of locks , the key for the key of keys , the answer to the six questions , the lowest in the highest , the highest in the lowest , the page without the book , the word on the page , the letter in the word , the name of the nameless , the time of the nine beginnings , the seventh purposefor the first purpose , the eleven laws for the one law , the all in the nothing , the nothing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no reason and the accident that 's no accident .

"  | " He 's worse than Shtymbar . From Shtymbar at least you could get once in a while a favor . " " Your case , I could say , it 's a question of working through the undermind a little bit . We work through the undermind and from the undermind we can get to the sphere of spheres and once we hondle with the sphere of spheres  --  " " That 's if Sussekranz is in the right mood .

I 'll say to him three times three what you 're supposed to say to only the highest of the highest angel order  --  ' Shtelbintel , Shtakrossvel , Shefkaporitz . ' " " Now you 're talking !

" Madam Ducoff coughed casually . " Meanwhile , let 's be on the safe side . Starting tonight  --  tonight the latest !  --  take step one to the bond of peace . " " In other words ... " " Put yourself on the highest height . " " I should forget Lakewood , I should try Monticello . " " Bring out the now in the here and the here in the now .

"  | " Realize that from the all in all has to be the nothing with nothing . " " He 's with a few years younger ? Who counts ! " " Keep in mind and do n't forget the four corners of the world . Number one corner . . . " Madam Ducoff stopped , sniffed , sniffed again , and slowly turned toward the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went " Bleh-heh " and " Yuch " and fanned the air in all directions . Marshall covered his face with two napkins , then covered the napkins with a menu . And Boomie , his behind still pointed at Madam Ducoff 's booth , said , " Farts bah medder wid yoo ? " Madam Ducoff 's first reply was to raise her arms and pass them back and forth , back and forth over the shopping bags while she moved her lips silently . Then she let her arms fall , blinked her red , dry eyes and said shakily , " I 'll tell to you what the Riboynoy-shel-oylom said to Job . When Job is krechtzing , You killed my family , You made me a pauper and a bum , and You gave me boils ; so what are You keeping me alive ? ' Be very grateful I got a Jewish heart . " The horsy fat-backed woman for the third time droned , " What 's going to be and what 's going to be ? " Madam Ducoff , spooning water over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say to you what the he dog said to the she dog when he got stuck in her , Things work themselves out . ' " " What you told me I did exactly . I put the powder in her farina half-strength , I watched out she should n't get too dopey , I buried on Bay Four what she cut from the nails ... " " The powders , " Madam Ducoff said thoughtfully , " we 'll maybe discontinue . "  | " I put under her mattress raisins and nuts . " " Next time , bridge mix , " Madam Ducoff instructed . " The dark chocolate . " " I waited until she was fast asleep , I looked if the moon was by Luna Park . " " By Luna Park or "  --  Madam Ducoff peeked into a shoppingbag  --  " by Feltman 's . " " And even so , a nix , " her client reported . " My Rhoda wants a boy , the boy do n't walk the earth yet . She wants a boy "  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her underlip  --  " loo-loo-loo , that he should know from the tea-yater and he should have only deep thoughts and he should wonder all the time about what 's in the soul . . . " " For that I could give drops . " ... and he should know from current events and he should n't listen too much to the radio , only to the Town Meeting of the Air , and he should go in for Cooper Union courses . " " Although the drops I do n't like . The drops you dass n't keep around too long . " " If I was the type mother that pushed , " declared her client , " all right , I 'd understand . But I talk to her with kid gloves . Rhoda , listen to your best friend , look in the mirror , you 'll see you 're not Toots Matzoknaydel that .. ' " Lady , " Simon croaked , " we we we got a boy for her . " " That 's right ! " said Marshall . Hymie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ... " " COCKtail gingerale , five cents a glass , " sang Boomie . Whereupon Madam Ducoff , white in the face and breathingthrough her mouth , labored out of the booth and crossed to their table . In a second Steinbrink , growling and with a rolled-up menu , was at her side , but she held him back . And wavering in her tracks she laid hands upon the boys . Upon Simon first , saying , " You got in Krasnowicz an uncle with two boys , and the younger one will pretty soon go to Moldonya and he 'll wear a cross . It wo n't help , it wo n't help . "  |p145Boomie  's brow and breast she touched , saying , " In Zitomaryou got one cousin , Sura Beryl , that she 's already startingto run and she 'll keep running . It wo n't help , it wo n't help . " Hymie 's brow and breast she also touched , saying , " By Polkotrovitz there 's a certain Amram Goldug , by your momma a nephew , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ca n't throw him down . It wo n't help , it wo n't help . " Marshall 's both hands she gripped , saying , " In Vlotcheniki your Aunt Tzeena the Baker is going to make it her business to everyday bake a special little baking and give away free to the priests . It wo n't help , it wo n't help . " " Waha ! " went Boomie. " ... teasing , " muttered Hymie . " Just just just teasing , " Simon wheedled . " Sure , " said Marshall . " She ca n't take a tease , " Boomie announced loftily . Then Steinbrink walked them to the door , saying , " Scram-mayvoo . " And Zwerkel said , " Goom-bye . " Then Steinbrink said , " This is what it is with today 's Jewish kids . " And Zwerkel said , " The Jewish kids of today are all this way . " But Madam Ducoff called back the boys and handed Simon and Boomie each a quarter , saying , " Kinde , kinde , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how the widower told his son right after the funeral . When his son sees he 's in bed with the maid : In my grief do I know what I 'm doing ? " All the way to the Surf the boys went , " It wo n't help , it wo n't help . " On the line , a long one , going almost to the Knishe Queen , they encountered Lila Edelstein . And for fifteen , twenty minutes , till she called over the matron , they made her life miserable.  |p147March  9 , 1938Last night Dad got in a philosophy mood . He was reading Gasoline Alley and they had in it what they have every year when its Skeezix 's birthday . They go all the way back to when he was put on Uncle Walt 's doorstep and they give the old cartoons how he started to get big . Dad then said how fast the time goes . Mom said Believe me , you look around and its all over and a person is a big big dope if she puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we should live and be well and she should feel better than she 's been feeling on her dropped stomach we 're all three going before Pesach to see Ohrbachs . I right away remembered so I naturally will give only the Highlights . Some of the Highlightsare -- I go to James Russell Lowell . Lowell the Hole ! High School . The third term . I skipped . I belong still to the Battle Aces S.A.C . We are thinkingp148of changing the name to the Last Mohicans or the Stars of David . Boomie and Hymie go also to James Russell Lowell . We are in the same Home Room and are all three taking a GeneralCourse . Marshall goes to Brooklyn Tech . He did very well on the admission test , one of the highest , because they give you mostly math and math he happens to be good in . Now all of a sudden he wants to be an aeronautical engineer . I smoke now . I get wet dreams . Theyre much much better then jerking off , except that you can jerk off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when you get . I have decided to be in love . The girl 's initials are C.D. Why I fell in love with her is that she reminds me of the one who played Dale Arden in the Flash Gordon chapter and she has a Jean Parker voice . The reason I say LOVE is she does n't even have big tits . I have pretty good teachers . They areFor Home Room Mrs. Jacobey . I have her also for ElementaryBiology a . She is interesting , she has a good sense of humor . Once she asked Give me another word for conjugation . Somebody giggled and she right away said NoT THAT word . For French Mr. Wexler . He is pretty good , he makes you have to pay attention . Everybody said Watch for a certainhabit , they were right . He always walks around and stands in a certain way with one foot on the radiator like he wants to show off he has big balls . For Geometry Mr. Zeldach . He was voted most popular teacher in Lowell . His wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faculty advisor on the Photography Squad . Bomba Katz belongs and he told me how he was once invited to his house and he saw about six big pictures of Mrs.p149Zeldach where you do n't exactly see her naked but you know she has to be naked . For English Miss Hochman . She is interesting and she tries and attempts to do different things . When we had to read " A Tale Of Two Cities " she made us write up our reportsas if what happened in the book was just just yesterday and we were newspaper reporters . She liked my headline , Sidney Carten Loses Head Over Lucy Manet . If I could jerk off on a teacher she 's who I 'd use . Because I happen to sit third row first seat she plops herself right on top my desk . I have to naturally pay attention and look up and when I look up I look up like right under her armpit . She wears only sleeveless , you can see where the tit starts . For Gym Mr. Stock . They call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a jock strap . He 's always saying You 'll be grateful later for the protection you give your testicles now . Everybody who has him knows how you get out of doing gym work with him . He 'll say Today is Horse Practice , or Today is Tumbling . So all you have to do is raise your hand and say You read or You heard that in Turkey there 's a lot of Syphillis . He will say That particular item I have not read or heard but I am not surprised boys as Syphillis has killed more persons then the wars all put together and is very highly prevelent today even . That is why we have to get into and establish strong cleanliness and protective habits and make it our regular and daily business to take good care of things like our testicles . March 11 , 1938Hymie 's bubbee got another stroke and one leg is paralyzedon her . I went up yesterday with Boomie to do my Bio and she was sitting around grinning and grinning . Hymie 's mom was yelling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ,  |p150I  'd also laugh good if I know its four weeks before Pesach and I do n't have to move a finger . In Hymie 's building they got a new super . Hohner . He likes us . His ambition is he wants to fuck one kind of girl from every country . He says he fucked ninety-three different girls from forty-seven countries and he found out one thing . That how you know when a girl wants to fuck is she lets you lick her bushkee . Hymie says he ca n't fix shit . Yesterday in Gelfman he had to go and call Mrs. Chepper to the phone . He left my malted on the machine so I went behind the counter , I threw in three melorols . March 15 , 1938I forgot yesterday to put in that I saw Miss Matucci . I say I forgot but I do n't know if I forgot or I did n't want to . What happened was I went to get Dads Forvitz and I saw Miss Matucci across the street go in the bakery . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , I think only once after I got out of public school . She had said to me on the last day I was one of the smart ones and she wanted me definitely to come see her and that she would follow my carreer with great interest . It was the first time anybody said to me CARREER . In fact she even signed my album TO SIMON SLOAN BRIGHTAND BRASH , IN HIS FUTURE CARREER HE WILL BE A SMASH , WITH FOND HOPES AND BEST WISHES TERESA MATUCCI . I crossed over and I went also in the bakery . I stood not too close to her , like by the coffee ring section . She was by their aclair and napoleon section . I then made believe I was really all along looking for the aclair and napoleon section . I even said to the bakery lady , Do you have today aclairs and napoleons ? She showed me where and I looked just at her and I moved where she was moving.  |p151I  then made believe as though I had not seen Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned around the forvitz to the back where they have only the English print and I said , Excuse me , Hello Miss Matucci . I was then without realizing it sort of raising my hand . Miss Matucci said Well hello there . Then it was her next and she told the bakery lady she wanted to pick up what was put away in the morning for Matucci . I said I remember you from P.S. 84 . She said Oh I believe I remember you too . I swear to God it just came out that I said Well we remembereach other . In a sort of snotty way . I then just went outside . Actually I did nt JUST go outsidebut I said like to myself I want to see whats in the window . Where she could see me through the window I stood . I made believe I was looking at the aclairs and napoleons . I smoked a cigarette I had left over . Why I smoked a cigarette . For 2 important reasons . One is a baby reason . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . Two was to show her not only and not so much I was a big boy but that she got older . On this no more and that 's it . March 18 , 1938Today it rained and nobody went out so the school cafeteriawas jammed . C.D. sat right by my table . She was walking and walkingand I kept wishing her over . SIT BY MY TABLE SIT BY MY TABLE SIT BY MY TABLE . As I was the only one she knew and she was the only one I knew we talked a little . It was so noisy she could n't hear.  |p152I  was talking inside my head and without moving my mouth . This is what I do sometimes on the subway , I can go AHAHAHAH . With the vibrations . In that way I talked , I looked right at her and I said I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU . An interesting thought occurred . That supposing everybody in the cafeteria and everybody everywhere in the world is doing the same exact thing but has in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I LOVE YOU I LOVE You and somebody from the next table is going FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU . Never mind . A continuation on March 18 , 1938What I forgot is when C.D. sat by my table I had n't eaten as yet my lunch . It was right on the table in a double bag . A chala and sardine sandwich , one piece of chala alone was two inches . The whole thing I threw away . Mom was sore I did n't save the bags . Dad said What did you expect from him you dumb dope you . I do n't blame him he walks all over you and he takes advantage . Why not and I would do the same thing if I had a mother a good natured lemon , when she nursed me she ate Suchard to make her milk rich . March 19 , 1938We were doing journalism in Miss Hochman 's class and Boomie gave the whole class such a laugh that Mr. Gladstone sent in somebody from next door to find out what happened . Miss Hochman wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole news event . She asked for blackboard volunteers . Boomie volunteered . He wrote this headline . FOWL PLAY IN CHICKEN MARKET . Before I forget I 'm putting down that I am feeling a little bad about the sandwich from yesterday . It must have had in it a whole King Oscar can . My action shows in a way lack ofp153character . I admit . Zachie Schaefer will wear a yarmalka right in cafeteria when he eats and I should in the same way not be ashamed if I have thick sandwiches . What if I went to school with only goyim , I then would have to starve ? March 2o , 1938 Something interesting . I ca n't jerk off on C.D.Not in the bathroom . In bed I can do it only if I use somebody elses body and then at the end just her face . March 22 , 1938Hohner told another way you can tell if a girl wants to get laid . She takes your cock and she starts rubbing it inside her twatzer . More on March 22 , 1938We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on have to sing the first AND the second stanza of " The Star Spankled Banner . " Also the boys could not wear sweatersin halls and classes and any sweater offense will be treated the same way as a lack of tie offense . MYRT AND MARGE went off the radio , this afternoon was their last time . At the end of the fifteen minutes the ones who play them said goodbye but they could n't talk . They cried . Mom could n't get over shikses could cry like that . March 28 , 1938 A Battle Aces S.A.C . meeting was held today . We had no real business . From last time there was a tabled resolution , whether we should consider uniting and unifying with Bomba Katz and the Spartan S.A.C . We again tabled it because while the Spartan S.A.C . has ping pong and weight lifting they are mostly highly orthodox . So on Friday nightp154and all day Saturday we would have to do hardly a thing which is not for us . We kidded around . Marshey had with him old guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely the best , and we tried for who was the fastest draw . I beat everybody . The way you do it is you tie the gun right over your knee . Thats where your hand exactly goes , it does n't have to move up or down and you save that little bit of time . We next did what we did n't do in a long time . Its in the Constitution . Everyone has to regularly tell a personel secret . We stopped doing it from I forget when . Hymie told that till he was between ten and eleven he thought when you went to the movies you had real actors and actresses and they were behind the screen . Marshey told that when he was about seven and they lived in Boro Park they had a neighbor Mr. Shatz and he thought Mr. Shatz was God . Boomie told that he had a cousin Cele and when they visited her he used to go into her bathroom because he was crazy about the smell of her shit . I for a second thought I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about ten I was positive I was Richard Dix 's son . We afterwards went near Ocean Parkway and Neck Road to squeeze tits . No girls were around . There was just a lady , she had a pair down to her belly . We all bounced them but we could n't squeeze as her coat was too heavy . On the way back she was still around . She wanted to know if we were Jewish . Boomie made believe he was dovening . The lady said Its not nice for Jewish boys to walk around in a Jewish neighborhood on Shabos and they should smoke . March 26 , 1938Rohner told us the best best lays he ever had live in the middle of Australia . He said there the girls have a lot of hairp155around their twatzers , that 's why they call it the bush country . Mrs. Abrams Sheldon passed high on the post office test . She invited in the whole floor for delicatessen . Mom got angry at Sheldon . She asked him if where he would work he could do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't answer . The downstairs bell rang , Mom got very nervous . She ticked back . It turned out it was Cousin Phillie . She said Hello stranger how are you , this is a very very pleasant surprise , and what brings you here . Cousin Phillie said he was in the neighborhood and he wanted to use the bathroom . It was a really beautiful day later so Mom and Dad and I went on the boardwalk . Mom told Dad in Jewish he should walk with me to talk and make better friends . Dad said I do n't know what to say . Mom said What whats the difference , just have like a little discussion . Dad said A discussion , how about we should have a discussion sonny . What do you like better , you like better a sour pickle or a half sour pickle ? I told him I used to like the half sour pickles better but I think now I like them both the same . Dad went back to Mom and he said , What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he was born this boy is my enemy . March 27 , 1938I wanted to put in something . Its philosophy but its not exactly philosophy . Never mind . March 28 , 1938 We had gym today . We were supposed to run around the indoor track ten times at least . Mr. Stock gave the announcement last week yet . I did n't feel like it as did nobody else in the class . We made up what to do . We went to gym and we lined up . After Mr. Stock took the attendance he read notices . We made believe we did n't under/stand them . One guy would say which exit do we have to use for a fire drill and another guy would say How can it be that exit , that exit they keep closed . Mr. Stock had to explain , this took ten minutes . Then Mr. Stock said Lets get on the track . Right away Shecky Meltzer said Mr. Stock , a venereal disease question . I have a friend and I was talking with this friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have the gonerea and sometimes you do n't know and you ca n't tell . Mr. Stock said It is not hard to know and there are certain laymen ways to tell about gonerea . The best layman way is that you get a burning and annoying pain inside your male organ . This is like the pain you can get sometimes and occasionallywhen you are soaping around the male organ and soap gets inside . Mr. Stock said You should watch there for the condition of your testicles , if you make it your business to keep your testicles in good health everything else will take care of itself . This took fifteen minutes . Juley Sher then got him with another question . What if you come to the gym and you forget your jock ? Should you borrow somebody elses jock ? Mr. Stock got more excited even than with the gonerea question and he said Absolutely the worst thing you could do to the health of your testicles is to wear another persons jock . He said He himself owns many different jocks that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more then a couple of days running . When he said running this reminded him about our track and he made us get going . The bell rang before we went around even twice . More on March 27 , 1938It will be remembered that I here wrote NEVER MIND recently.  |p157This  was for thoughts I had on Sunday Night . These thoughts started first with a thought of Chic Sale , that he 's dead . I then went to another thought about when I met Miss Matucci . This gave me cramps . My next thought was how Chic Sale played once Lincoln and that Lincoln also was dead . I figured out that Lincoln was dead and Chic Sale was dead and I also would be dead . This was n't just imagining . I can IMAGINE myself a lot of times dead , but I 'm dead the way you 're dead in the movies . In other words you 're dead but you 're not really dead because you know you have to play in another movie . I all of a sudden knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousey rottenthing I started in to go AHAHAHAII and I squeezed and squeezed my throat . With both hands . The next thought I went to was this could be the best secret weapon in the world . In the SPIDER once they had a secret weapon . It was a certain sound . A machine made that sound and could kill all the people anywhere who heard it . This would be just as good . This would be BETTER . If you somehow could get control of this thought and if you could put this thought into the minds of people and if you could regulate it and make this thought stronger and stronger and stronger nobody could stand it . They would be killed by a busting of the brain . That 's how it was bad , that 's why for that night I put downNEVER MIND . March 30 , 1938Where Mister George the beauty parlor was a store is supposedto open up . They have a sign HYMANS HONEYPOT a new line of health foods . Dad has a chance for a promotion . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakewood and Dad said the managerdropped him hints if he wants to be the ticket tearer.  |p158Mom  cried . She said Shmuel you can say you got a smart wife . I knew I knew I knew something good would happen , I had in a dream that my momma met C. Aubrey Smith and he gave her for me a beautiful bunch of undershirts , I did n't even have to pick up the hem . Dad said I hope you washed them good , not that C. Aubrey Smith is n't a clean type but you ca n't tell who he got them from . March 31 , 1938I looked in the girls toilet for a second today . This was because as I was passing a girl opened the door . Boomie said he thinks they have machines there where the girls buy napkinstwo for a nickel . We were talking about when a girl gets periods with Hohner . He said if you look at their snatchers from certain angles you wonder how something that looks so terrible could feel so good . He told sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunches . April 3 , 1938 I am probably even more in love with C.D.Today in French there were absences and I was moved up three seats from my regular seat . This put me in the next row and one seat in front of C.D.As Mr. Wexler was giving us number drill he filled up the blackboard in front and so he went to use the side blackboard . I turned around to see him and in doing so I looked up C.D.s dress . This was not even my fault , she had her legs crossed . I saw definitely up to her pants . I think I saw twat hair but Im not definite . C.D. saw that I had seen . This is definite . What she then did was not to move her legs for a few min/utes . If I wanted I could have kept looking up her dress but I naturally did nt . After a few minutes she moved her legs and crossed them a different way . She did something with her shoe as if she was telling me Im moving my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something with my shoe not because I want to embarass you for your accidental looking . Never mind . April 4 , 1938A letter came from school today that I have an over 91 average . Next term if I want I can take 5 majors . Captain Blood is coming down to the Surf . We missed it , I forget why . I and Boomie and Hymie and Marshey will all go together . Rabbi Neuberger died . For my fifth major it will be either History or Spanish . Most likely History as I 'm afraid to get mixed up with Spanishand French . April 5 , 1938I got back an EXCELLENT ! from Miss Hochman today . This was from the assignment last week to write at least a page and a half on a very ordinary saying . What we wrote was not supposed to be ordinary . She gave us like A STITCH INTIME SAVES NINE and DO N'T CROSS YOUR BRIDGES TILL YOU COME TO THEM . I took WHAT YOU DO N'T KNOW WO N'T HURT YOU . What I wrote I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to re-write on good paper and with the headings . For my concrete example I put in something you see all the time in cartoons . This is when like in a Terrytoons the animal is chased up a tree . He keeps climbing the tree and he will always go up and up to where there is no more tree.  |p160But  he does n't realize , he climbs and he climbs the thin and empty air . Then he will always at a certain part take a look into this thin and empty air , he will all of a sudden realize what he is doing has to be impossible and he will then fall and crash down . I showed it to Mom and Dad . Mom cried , Dad said I got my own troubles . April 6 , 1938No teacher did too much today as it was the last day before the Easter Week Vacation . We got a big letter from one of Dad 's relatives in Europe . She is a girl who wants to go to America , if we could help . Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I was born did n't send even a mazeltoff . April 8 , 1938 Fun today with Hymie 's bubbee . She was sitting around talking to herself in Jewish . Somethinglike the whole world should give one one little move and turn upside down . Hymies mom told us You 're smart boys , maybe you can do me a little favor . ' What she wanted was we should figure out a way that the bubbee would sign a certain thing from the WilliamsburgSaving Bank . I WANT THE BEARER TO DO ME A FAVOR AND TAKE OUT FROM MY ACCOUNT ONLY THE INTEREST FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS . At my idea we all tried signature practice . We said that the bubbee should hear Let 's have a contest to see who has the nicest signature . I wrote on the back of the bank thing my signature , also Hymie and Hymie 's mom wrote their signature . We then turned it over and Hymie said Hey bubbee show us how you do your signature , you know everybody that my bubbee she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she showed us her ass . At Boomie 's idea we then all went to the window and we made believe we were waving . Hymie 's mom even went out on the fire escape . She said very loud What is it President Roosevelt , I do n't hear you too good . Boomie said You too President Roosevelt , you too have a happy Pesach . I said The bubbee ca n't come to the window President Roosevelt , she 's also a cripple . Hymie 's mom said You want her to sign what , I ca n't hear you President Roosevelt , what should she sign ? Boomie said Gee and no kidding President Roosevelt , you tried to call the bubbee by Gelfman only the line was busy , gee . I said , What you should do President Roosevelt , you know what , when you go on the radio again say MY FRANZ AND THEBUBBEE TOO . Hymie 's mom said In other words President Roosevelt , let me understand how you put it , you put it this way and this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bubbeehas to sign , the bubbee better sign or she ca n't get no more pollyseeds . We then closed the window and we all went looking in the bubbee 's draw for pollyseeds and we took away the bag . Hymie 's mom thought she had one probably in the bloomers but she would get it later . The bubbee said in Jewish she would sign they should take out the interest . Not for five months interest , for three months . Hymie 's mom said It 's a deal , let it be three months , it 's erev Pesach , Pesach is a happy holiday , I will be the good one . When we went down Hymie showed that he snitched a dime from the bubbee 's draw . He treated to egg creams at Gelfman , the small.  |p162A|pril  9 , 1938We saw today Captain Blood with Errol Flynn and Frame Up with Dick Foran . Captain Blood I liked VERY much . It was a long double bill , they gave four cartoons and the March of Time . We all wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would make us late to the seder . In Captain Blood they had the best duel scenes I ever saw . When it was over I had to go to the toilet which was very crowded . Everybody kidded around , they shoved and they shpritzed water . I felt very tough and wanted to have a fight . That feeling I remember I got when I saw G Man , in the part where James Cagney throws a guy all over the room . Also from the Prizefighter and the Lady , when Max Baer starts in to win Primo Carnera . Then what happened is we went out in the street and the first thing is that by the Knishe Queen they 're putting the chairs on top of the tables to close early for the seder . I right away and immediately did n't feel tough and I did n't want to have a fight or anything . I had the feeling like there was a squeeze of my balls . Enough on this . No more and never mind . The seder was all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , he did n't feel like bothering with all the plagues . Mom cried . She said she just just just remembered how when she was in Hartford Connecticut Cousin Phillie promisedwhen she got married he would take care of the liquor , sure he took care of the liquor , he and his came , and all by themselves they took care of nearly a whole whole case . Dad was talking how when I was a little boy I got my biggestkick on the seder playing with his yarmalka . He showed me how I used to grab the yarmalka and I used to swing it around and I used to then put it in my mouth.  |p163He  said Look what you did to it momzer murderer and Look at the mark you made on an all-silk yarmalka , even the stitching is silk . He started zetzing me with it , he was n't kidding around . Mom had to hold him under the sink water and sing him Jewish songs after . April io , 1938I by myself walked on the boardwalk all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the seders and Marshey I did n't feel like seeing . That 's all about him . Never mind and forget it . I smoked 2 cigarettes and in the new place I bought a waffle and ice cream . This is definitely a chumitz . Then something happened to give me a sad feeling . What happenedThere was a husband and a wife on a bench . I swear to God and I should drop dead that the man looked like me . Not how I look now exactly , how I could look when Im his age . The wife I just just could n't stand . I right away and immediatelythrew a hate on her . For no exact reason . On account of her mouth was too thin and her lips were too thin I wanted her to go to hell . My feeling was that this was the REAL TRUTH , the way that time I had the REAL TRUTH about Miss Matucci and Chic Sale and being dead . The wife was the REAL TRUTH about gettinglaid like that was the REAL TRUTH about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you shit . I later talked to Hohner about this , but in a kidding way . He showed me with a pencil and paper how you 're better off not getting married and that its much much cheaper when you feel like getting laid to go to the whores . Even the most expensive ones.  |p164A|pril  11 , 1938I and Boomie and Hymie went to squeeze tits near Neck Road . Marshey did n't feel like going and his mother did n't let us even in the house . She said he 's in with a new crowd from Brooklyn Tech , they have in common together engineering things , and as you get older you go to different interests . By mistake we grabbed the tit of a girl we know . This is because who looks at the faces ? She was Marie Esposito , she went to Junior High with us and she took a Commercial Course . We later went to a movie we were never in before , the Elmont on Neck Road . They had two old pictures that were very good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Lukas and Riff Raff with Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow . Even so I like it better in a movie I know . Here I did n't want to go to the toilet . It takes me a long time to get used to a movie toilet , the one in the Surf I was n't used to till I think I was nine or ten . Dad came home in a good mood and excited . His manager told him he 'll have a ticket tearer tryout next week maybe . So before supper we practiced with cardboard . I and Mom would go up to him , we would be the mother and her boy who 's more than twelve and she 's trying to sneak him in on a half-price . Mom made me write up in ink a little chart for Dad he should have it handy and know what to say in the differing situations . DO N'T TELL ME THIS LUMP IS ONLY 11 LADY OR MRS . I SHOULD HAVE IN THE BANK $100 BILLS HOW MUCH YOUR GOLEM IS OVER 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHERE HE 'S 11 IN HIS SHOES HE 'S ELEVEN . LADY OR MRS . GO BACK AND TELL YOUR HUSBAND BUY HIMSELF A FULL PRICE . Dad did pretty good . Mom 's only criticism is he should n't  |p165should  n't should n't forget he 's in front of the public and when you 're in front of the public you have to keep smiling . April 12 , 1938 Nothing I did n't see is in the movies . When Mom went shopping I shaved off cock hair . Also I burned up toilet paper . Boomie and Hymie later called for me . We went downstairs and kidded around with Hohner . He had a good joke . He asked Why do you call a snatch a snatch ? You 're supposedto say I 'll bite . He answers Me too . He also told a new Mae West joke . That one I forgot . Dopey Duhvee 's mother called us from the window if we wanted to take him for an airing . We said all right for ten cents each . We went with him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then had an idea . We made believe the penny arcade man wanted to give him a bar mitzva present . We told him Go inside Duhvee , he 's got some wonderful presents for you , wow does he have for Duhvee presents , you 'll get presents . He went inside , they did n't know what he was talking about . This got him sore . Right away he ran on the beach , he put a lot of sand in his stocking hat and also in his pocket and he went back in the arcade . He there threw around the sand everywhere and on everything . Also he banged his head on that glass thing with the mechanical gypsy inside . It cracked the glass a little and part of what makes her hand move fell off . The penny arcade man and his wife and another lady tried to get him out . We all made believe we just just happened to walk in . We all three together said , Look who 's here , Marshall Herberg , 881 Brighton 5 St. , Apt.1GG. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw sand on us . His mother did n't like that there was sand in his hat . She said we did n't take such hot care of him and gave us only a quarter all together . April 13 , 1938 Mrs. Plant got us up very early . She wanted Mom should do her a favor . She said Mr. Plaut is sleeping in an unusual way and I do n't like how he looks . We went down and we all looked . He was blue and he had a smell . Mom started in to cry a lot and then Mrs. Plaut started in to cry a little . Mom said in Jewish , Rifka Rifka your pearl , your jewel , your diamond is gone . He 's gone , good bye and good luck your lover that to him you were the sun the moon and the stars , he would n't let you open a door yourself and he would n't let you take an extra step and he would n't let you lift a heavy bag and he cried if he saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and he would cry Malvena I ca n't ca n't ca n't take it and I do n't want to be there to see my bride my princess clean out the ice box . Mom started to cry a little and Mrs. Plant started to cry a lot . Mom said I 'm not crying now for him because for him it 's all over , he 's taken care of and finished off , he got no more worries . Malvena the Orphan is crying for the living widow that she 'll be all alone by herself on the earth and in such such a big apartment , what does she need like this three and 1/2 rooms , you could say four rooms because the foyer by itself is practically a room . Mom started to pull her hair and Mrs. Plaut started to choke herself . Mom said For now and in the next weeks I 'm not so worried about the living widow . For now and in the next fewp167weeks she 'll have coming and going and hustle and bustle and a full house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting shooting cramps on my dropped stomach , when the time comes and she realizes shes Mrs. Nobody and a Teitlebaumwho handles her now with kid gloves and opens up for her half a quarter a fresh box of farmer cheese starts in with his big mouth . Mom started in banging on the wall and Mrs. Plaut started in kicking on the floor . Mom said What I do n't do n't do n't want to think about is how the living widow is going to start in not eating and she 'll figure how for one person it do n't pay to prepare and for herselfalone a snip of tomato and onion is plenty good enough . That 's why not only a Teitlebaum is going to take terrible advantage of her but also a type like Joe the Vegetable Man , he 'll figure why not and what does it hurt , I need her very very badly with her tomato and onion business . Mom made believe she was going to stab herself with a cut glass bowl and Mrs. Plaut made believe she was throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to have to have broad shouldersthe living widow Mrs. Nobody , she 'll have to realize peoplewo n't have no interest in her , she 'll be walking in the street , that 's when she has the strength to leave the house , she 'll see somebody and she 'll say hello how are you and what 's happening , they 'll answer her excuse me if I rush along and hurt your feelings but I 'm not interested in you . Her own own children will behave to her no different , what 's the matterdo n't I remember a certain case you should remember it too , they had it on W E V D , how the living widow comes back from the funeral , her husband 's grave is still still fresh , she opens up a closet to change into a little house dress and she looks and looks and she finally asks her boy , whether he was Milton or Myron I do n't remember , she says Milton or Myron did you happen to notice a house dress that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady for the work you 'll be doing in the chicken market you do n't need no fancy house dresses . Mom fainted on the floor and Mrs. Plaut fainted on the chester draws . I then went to get Mrs. Abrams and Mrs. Harlib and they took over so Mom could make breakfast . We had sour cream and pear and Mom put on a fresh undershirt . Mom said To hell with it , who cares and never mind , todayI 'll neglect the house a little , we 'll live one one day in a dirty house , I 'll run back to the widow a few hours , it 'll be a real real real rnitzvoor . Mom sent me down to Mrs. Plaut , I should tell her Please please please take it easy , she 's coming right down in a few minutes to cheer her sorrow and ease up her grief . April 14 , 1938Mom went to the funeral , Dad and I were in the house alone the whole morning . He had a real good mood . He made me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me eat from the pot to get all the fried part . We had nice discussion . He told me an Old Country story about why he always loved the emperer FRANZ JOSEPH . His father was like in the Austrian Army and they were having a special inspection and the emperer Franz Joseph was walking up and down with the generals and all the soldiers had to absolutely not move . Then a little before they get to the row where his father is his father sneezes . So emperer Franz Joseph with all the generals stop and they look and they look at his father . Dad got an old hat and he put it on his head in a crazy way to show the way they all looked.  |p169Then  the emperer Franz Joseph says to the generals they should bring him later this soldier who sneezed at his empererfor a special punishment . So a whole bunch of soldiers come and they march march march his father to the emperer . Dad did around the kitchen how they went march march march . The soldiers then stand behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees . Dad even got down on his knees . The emperer Franz Joseph gives his father a look but he does n't say anything . Then he says Are you the soldier who gave a sneeze before ? His father tries to answer only nothing comes out . So allthe soldiers kick him and with the guns they hit him . Then the emperer Franz Joseph asks him again Are you thesoldier who gave a sneeze before ? Again his father tries to answer and again he ca n't talk . So all the soldiers again beat him up . Then the emperer Franz Joseph says I will ask one more time for the last time are you the soldier that gave a sneeze before ? His father finally answers him how he 's the soldier . So the emperer Franz Joseph says Gezundheight . I then helped Dad straighten up and also he let me put new batteries in his search light . Also he gave me z and I got the NEWS by Gelfman , Dad let me have the jokes first . Dad talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was named Plainclothes Tracy and how Moon Mullins used to look different . He said Some day we should go only the two of us on the West End Line . Also he said If the West End Line goes near the Roxy movie and if the Roxy movie happens to have on the stage Janp170Peerce we might go to the Roxy . This is because his manager told him how everyone has to see the Roxy before he dies . I swear to God and let me drop dead that I did n't do anything . He just just got sore and he nearly broke the search light on me . He said You rotten momzer murderer you know you 're going to outlive me . I went in the toilet and I locked the door until he had to go to work . Tomorrow is back to school . April 15 , 1938I got a notice in Home Room to fill out and hand in my fifth major request by ten days . Mr. Zeldach did something interesting in Geometry . He showed us with geometry how a slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very annoyed and also depressed . Because it made me think of engineering and from engineering I went to Marshey . I have to put here that this morning when I was going to school he was going upstairs on the Brighton , he was holding a model plane . I will write in here that it was a beauty and I never in my life saw a better model plane , which is something I ca n't do , I do not have the knack . So although I had planned and figured out for this kind of happening , that we would bump into each other and I would play dumb , natural habit made me right away grin and wave . Definitely he saw how I waved but made believe he did n't . So I am planningmy revenge for years from now . He 'll be a big shot and with a lot of people and I 'll go over , I 'll say Hello shmuk and I 'll shake hands with him . While I 'm shaking hands I 'll give him an indian burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little victrola . THE MARSEILLAISE everybody loved . Mr. Wexlerlike conducted us . On the marchons marchons part C.D. without realizing it held longer to her note then everybodyp171else . She has some voice . She went for a second as high as Deanna Durbin . I forgot over the vacation how I loved her . I did in my throat I love you I love you I love you . Never mind . This reminds me . I had a dream I was talking to Hohner . He was definitely Hohner even though in the dream he was supposed to be a movie actor , I think Dewey Robinson , the big shlubb , he 's usually a waiter or he owns the bar . The both of us are standing on line to see Transatlantic Tunnel . He 's either treating me or I gave him the money for my ticket , I forget why . In the dream I remember that I 'm afraid when we get insideI wo n't get a good seat . Like I 'll be sitting facing the wrong way or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dreams before where they put me on the outside and I see the movie only from far away . I tell this to Hohner in the dream , that he should be careful when he buys the ticket and to make sure they have a regular seat for me . This is how he answers me , he says , his exact exact words , Look do n't worry . Every body gets laid . Right away or pretty soon I made myself wake up . I forget why but I felt so lousey and I got such cramps I had to go to the toilet . Usually I do n't need to go till after I eat breakfast . I did n't really forget why but never mind and no more . April 16 , 1938 For my fifth major I handed in History . In the Sugar Bowl I saw C.D. She said just to talk I do n't know if I should get the lime rickey . I said They make a good one here . I think she wanted me to buy her one or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the money . Like from the dream I did in my throat Some body is going to lay you Some body is going to lay you.  |p172I  jerked off on Hohner doing it to her and to Helen Mack and Frances Dee . April 17 , 1938I notice between my wrists and my elbows I 'm getting like a muscle with veins . Hymie has it a year already . In Biology there was a movie on digestion . Every body was kidding around . Like when it said on the bottom AND NOW THE SMALL INTESTINE IN ACTION Sol Wershba clapped . It was to me definitely sort of disgusting , all the organs going in and out and you see the juices for PERISTALSIS . I sat up front with Boomie to see better . Naturally we started laughing . We laughed so hard the whole row shook . Then just when I was stopping Boomie went PERISTALSIS and I got it worse then before . Mrs. Jacobey did n't notice . In English we were having a discussion from the NEw YORK TIMES . Miss Hochman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial ? The three main points brought out by the editorial are Implementation of the League of Nations , the Reduction of Armaments and Greater Intercourse between different countries . Boomie passed a note FUCK GERMANYand that finished me . Miss Hochman said We shall wait until the babies come to order . April 18 , 1938The Battle Aces S.A.C . were supposed to have a meeting today . We made up not to as there was no new business . Anywaywe all had homework . Dad started in today to be the ticket tearer . He had a good mood today and Mom made us do the Happiness Dance . He showed us a note that came for him in care of his manager . Congratulations and mazel tuff to you and yours on the beginning of a new career , your very good friend President Roosevelt.  |p173A|pril  19 , 1938LaGuardia talked last night in the Lowell auditorium and he went up Brighton Beach Avenue . We saw from the roof . He was in a big car that you could move back the top and he sat on something high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute and Mr. Harlib said That 's all right and do n't worry , he 's plenty big enough and God bless him the little luksh . Mrs. Plaut said All the lukshin are very strong and if you look careful you can see that for his size he 's solid . Mrs. Harlib said I 'd like to see him for two minutes that 's all I want , two minutes let him get locked up in one room with Mussolini . Dad said He could have done a lot more then he did for the cap industry . A lady across the street yelled Hello little flower hello there my piezon . He yelled back Hello lonslight . Mrs. Harlib and Mrs. Plant said how he speaks a beautiful Jewish . Mr. Harlib said The Jewish people got in him a good friend . Mrs. Harlib said In him and in Senator Wagner . Dad said Senator Wagner could also have done a lot more then he did for the cap industry . As I had my homework done I went over to Hymie 's house . His mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking in Jewish why there was a commotion . His mom answeredher in Jewish , the exact words I could n't get , that it was Mayor LaGuardia and he came over special to see the bubbee but she would n't let him , she told him Mayor LaGuardiaI 'm very sorry only I got to punish the bubbee and she ca n't see you as she did a wet on the toilet seat . April ao , 1938I did n't feel good and stayed home with a hundred and a half.  |p174I  read an old Boy Allies . THE BOY ALLIES AT THE ARGONNE . I still liked it a little . Also I looked through the New York Times Illustrated History Of The Great War . Mom rested in bed with me a while and looked through it with me . She cried from it and said what a terrible time that was and we and the whole whole world should never again know from such a terribletime , people were paying sixty-nine and seventy-nine cents a dozen eggs . What I noticed was that in the pictures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't just the clothes , I even covered the clothes with my hand to get only the faces . What it is is on the eyes . On the eyes they have that Real Truth look . Like they know already when people look at the pictures of them they will be dead . Also I had the feeling that if I as I am now was in the picture too with them as they were then and there was something in front of us we definitely would not see the same thing . They would see a house and I would see a house but it would n't be the same REAL Truth about a house . This is a worry I have for a long time . Not a long time but definitely a couple of years . It has to do with once I was in the movies , it was Sally Eilers in Small Town Girl and I started all of a sudden to wonder . What if what I am watching in the movies , a certain part , is not the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in case , most likely not , but just in case it would turn out I am watching differently from every body else and I do n't want to know . I listened to Jimmy Fiedler . He had on Charley Ruggles and Mary Boland . When I was listening to The Earth Turns Boomie and Hymie came over . They brought me the homework . I was lucky as there was n't much . The whole school had no first period and my first period is Geometry which is the most homework . Instead of a first period they had in all the home rooms a discussion on too much noise and kidding around in the cafeteria and before we go to assembly.  |p175A|pril  21 , 1938I felt all right and I had no temperature , it was even a little bit under normal . So I went to school . In the cafeteria a commercial course girl fainted . There were two girls near me and one of them I saw write in the other girl 's notebook . It took her no time to write so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one looked in the notebook and she laughed . This was a real dirty laugh , it was much worse then when I and Boomie are laughing dirty . Then the other girl said You HAD to write it in my notebook you slobbina . She tore out the whole page . What was on it I'mpositive had to be PERIOD Or HER PERIOD . I 'm sorry for a girlthat she could faint from it but also it makes me very nausous . Never mind and forget it . The one who fainted was taken away by Mr. Dembo and Mr. Swig . They did n't carry her . What they did was each one got a grip on her under the arm . I definitely saw from where I was that Mr. Dembo was making his elbow rub on her tit . Bernie Schrier came over , he also saw . The only other thing today to note and mention was beforethe girl fainted I saw C.D. at a table without friends . She gave me a little wave and I gave her a little wave . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to as again I had one of Mom 's chala sandwiches . I had on me only a nickel and I was too hungry for just milk or just a Drakes cake . April 22 , 1938Today I was in Geometry and a kid from the dean 's office came in . He had a blue card and he gave it to Mr. Wexler . Mr. Wexler said Go with him Sloan Simon and take your books . I dropped my loose leaf one and half the pages came out . When we got to the dean 's office the kid like pushed me into a chair . I want to here put down honest to God and I should only drop dead that even in front of Dr. Richter or any/body I would n't have let him get away with the push . In fact I even so sort of pushed back . But I got the thought , it was like a pop and then a whistle in my ears that I was being called down for only only one thing , for squeezing Marie Esposito 's tits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he right away said to me You sit . You just sit there . I said I 'm sitting I 'm sitting . He said One sitting , I want only one sitting from you . Also he said No crossing of legs . I did in my throat Drop Dead FuckingBastard Prick . Then when I opened my loose leaf notebookto fix the pages a little , they were all mixed up and dirty from when I dropped them in Geometry , he told me no studyinghere and no notebooks here , this is not the study hall and he shut the book on me . He was yelling and I said May I say something Dr. Richler and Dr. Richler I SHOULD like to say something , I am AWARE this is not study hall . Why I used aware was to show him I had a nice vocabulary . He in a way understood and definitely he did n't like that and he told the secretary I want a Character Card for this one , oh this one is to get a Character Card . Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and a father . They sat where I could n't see exactly . When he went back in he purposely left open the door . The reason I here say Purposely is that two times the father went over to shut it . Both times he worked and worked on the knob so the door should shut without noise and both times Dr. Richler banged it open . The father then said in a nice way to tell him what the gym ball costs , he 'll settle it up right away here with pleasure because if he does n't go to work before twenty after ten he gets docked in his place the whole half a day . Dr. Richler said Uhhuh yow yow but I would be more concernedMr. and Mrs. is it Shapiro with an e or Shapiro with an i with your boy , your son in that he reveals and demonstrates personality defect.  |p177The  mother said to the father in Jewish I do n't understand do you understand . She said to the father and to Dr. Richler in English A defect I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a pull you say that pull is a defect . The father said Its the same thing but its in the personality . The mother said So then what it is is not good . Dr. Richler said Uh huh yow yow well that certainly is not good . The father said I realize Dr.Dr . Richler said to the mother I wonder , truly I wonder and indeed I wonder if yow you realize this fact , if you understand fully this situation and GRASP it . The father said to the mother He wants to know , the Dr. is asking if you have an understanding if you got a GRASP . The mother said I get the grasp that its important and she started in to cry . Dr. Richler said Well I do n't think do you think becoming emotional and giving way and vent to an outburst will help and aid the trouble your boy is in , his situation . The mother said I grasp how there 's trouble . Dr. Richler said I would like you to see and view what is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mother said I left my reader glasses in the house , we wanted not to be late for you Dr.What he did , this is what he did Dr. Richler , he would n't pass over the record . He made them have to get up and walk behind and stand near his chair . He did n't even move away the chair they should have room to stand . I forgot to put down that before that the bell rang to change period and I felt like before I throw up . I did in my throat Marie Esposito Marie Esposito Ginzo Ginzo . What exactly the mother and the father said I then missed . Dr. Richler started in telling them the record would go forever with their son , it would show and reveal him a negative char/acter for his disturbances in study hall and being a cafeteria nuisance and indulging in gym ball destruction . The mother cried . The father said Dr. we 'll give it to him , believe me he will get it from us oh he 'll get it do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not worried and not at all was he worried , they should worry that their son 's record would count always in the future against him with possible and potential employers by showing personality defectand negative character . I did in my throat BULL SHIT COW SHIT CHICKEN SHIT CAT SHIT HORSE SHIT BULL SHIT . Probably I did it a little loud andhe turned around and told me Fermez la bouche you shut that trap there . I did n't put in he teaches French , he 's supposedto be a lousy teacher and every body tries not to get him . I 'll definitely forget so let me put it down here . That I beginnow to understand from the movies something . Like from Let Us Live and Fury . I really did n't understand before how in these and similar movies there was a REAL TRUTH . That you could go along nice and fine and you do n't know all the time and everywhere there are people who in a minute , in a second from the little nothing you do can get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll just wait but if they get you once in their hands they finish you . There was then a whole business with records . The mother said she did n't think and she never in her life knew things like that should go on a boy 's record . Dr. Richler said Yow uh huh well you did n't think you should think . The bell rang for classes to start . I got very dizzy , I had to put my head down on top my books . Definitely I had temperature . On account of that there was a whole thing I could n't hear . Dr. Richler was yelling OF COURSE . The mother said Dr. you mean to say.  |p179Dr  . Richler said I mean to say . Yes . The father said What she wants to express Dr. is how we want to pay what the gym ball costs so the gym ball should be taken away from the record . Dr. Richler like sang in a slow way It Stays On The Record The Record Stays STAYSThe father and the mother talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAYSThe mother said Please it should n't stay . Dr. Richler wrote down something and he showed them . The mother said Dr. I do n't see without my reader glasses and the father told her the Dr. wrote no . I do n't have here down that another kid was brought in . He had dandruff in his eye lashes even , he looked like he jerked off in shit . Dr. Richler went over and pinched his cheek with a twist , then he said not to him but to the whole office This one yow this chappy I am looking forward to , he definitely is an old friend this chappy . And the kid even though you could see tears from the pinch was going heh heh heh , also he was grinning like a real shmuk . I did in my throat fuck you Dr. Richler prick fuckhead you should only cock so I would ever grin like that for you . What happened finally with the mother and father I do n't know exactly , they went and the mother was crying . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do and what did you do . I answered him Go way will you do me a favor and go way you dumb idiot prick . Also I said to him a good one . You know the Otz brothers ? He fell right in , naturally , he said Who are the Otz brothers ? I said go Fotz and Plotz and he did his shmuk grin . I had to go to the toilet , when I go usually is after Geometry . But Dr. Richler then called me in . Right away I found out it was n't for Marie Esposito . He said to me Sloan Simon where is your dental note ? We did back and forth My dentalp180note Your dental note My dental note Your dental note . I told him my dental note was handed in for a long long time already , the beginning of the term . He said Sloan Simon yow you 're down for a note . You know what it was ? What it was and the note I was down for is Mrs. Jacobey by mistake put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to bring it . So Dr. Richter went and looked up my whole record , he saw my average that I had a 91 . He told the secretary This is one of the superiors , mark this as Mistake Probable . He gave me a pass and he said All right all right go back , return to classes mon vieux , do you know what mon vieux means . I told him its an idiom , like my old friend my buddy . Then I went to the toilet and during washing my hands I noticed something . Never mind . All right I 'll put it in . That in the mirror I saw how I was grinning that same same exact shmuk grin . I , myself , and me . April 23 , 1938 This is funny . In the hall I and Boomie bumped right into Marie Esposito . Boomie had real nerve , he said right away to her Hello Marie , hi ya piezon . She said hello , she even waved . But she did n't know us from shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , he said Do n't worry , she knew you but she liked getting her tits squeezed . Also we should remember girls like to get fucked as much as boys . April 24 , 1938Miss Hochman gave us an interesting and an easy assignment . To take something in a magazine or a newspaper andmake it much shorter but to keep in all the principle ideas . A whole bunch of locks got clipped off in gym today , thep181plain locks not the combination . Every body says it was done by Mr. Stock because you have to get the combination ones from him and he makes money . C.D. crossed her legs and I think she looked at me to see was I watching . An embarrassing moment in English , I forgot . Miss Hochman still has that habit , she walks to my row and she plops on my desk . So today she did n't know I had my hand there and I did n't know she would sit . Tonight I think is the first first night I ever jerked off on a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up and choose a magazinething for Miss Hochman 's assignment . It has to be in Tuesday . C.D. was there . She told me she was doing honor work on Edgar Allen Poe . A friend was with her , Faye Citrin . I know Faye a little bit from junior high , she was in the two class . We all three talked for a minute . I asked did you see Sequoia , they said they would see it probably . Sequoia I mentioned for Jean Parker , C.D. makes me always think of her . On the way out I and Faye Citrin walked together because CD. had to rush . Her class was all the way on the first floor but we had to be right near the library . Before she went C.D. for a second turned around and she like shook hands with Faye Citrin . Immediately I noticed this because girls never or very very seldom shake hands . Faye Citrin then said to me right after Gee she 's a very nice person . I said like Marshey , SURE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till at night when I got cramps . Becausefirst I had a feeling that C.D. must definitely have been talking about me to Faye Citrin and Faye Citrin wanted to know from me how I felt about C.D. , that 's why they shook hands . For a signal.  |p182I  right away figured out C.D. must like me and from that I jumped in my mind to C.D. on a toilet seat and getting the period . Never mind . April 27 , 1938We went to McGinnis for a roast beef before Sequoia and a bunch of ginzos started up . Because probably there were plenty of Jewish people around they did n't gang up . They wanted our best fighter against their best fighter , a fair fight . We picked naturally Hymie , they picked a guy Sal and we went behind the new house on Ocean Avenue . Hymie and this guy Sal did n't just fight right away , they had first a warmup . Hymie jumped on a fire escape ladder and he chinned himself eight nine times one handed , that 's the hardest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackknife . Sal only jumped on the ladder and he jumped right off . Definitely he could n't chin himself good as he had a differenttype build , the way Hohner is built . You look at Hohner you would n't pick him for punchball but boy he can lift . Then Hymie took off his ring and he put his money in a different pocket and he made his belt looser and he rolled up the sleeves on his sweater all the way . This Sal did n't do a thing , he just spit and he made fun of Hymie . He said You want to fuck around you want to fight . Hymie said You worried . He 's worried . This Sal said I do n't worry I worry for shit shit is what you are I do n't worry for you . His gang went Start in Start in so he made believe he was going to hit but he only pushed Hymie with both hands . Hymie dodged , it was a beauty how he dodged , but he did n't push back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sore.  |p183This  Sal said You 're full of fucking shit . Hymie said So I 'm full of fucking shit , fucking shit do n't get me sore . Sal said I do n't have to get you sore , what do I have to get you sore , you got a sore , they gave you a sore already on your cock . Hymie told him now he was getting a little bit angry but he still was n't sore . Sal said it was too fucking bad he was n't sore and he gave Hymie a rap on the head . Hymie gave him a nice one in the belly . I and Boomie said That 's one for one , Sal 's gang went Give him in the kilyoons . Sal kept rushing Hymie all the time and he would swing with his eyes shut and Hymie would give him nice little shots but only in the belly . He absolutely did n't go for the head , he just boxed him . Then they like clinched and a lady yelled down they should stop and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every body wanted them to fight some other place but Hymie said he still was n't sore and we went away . I did n't write that this Sal was so so winded he could n't hold up his hands and Hymie had plenty of wind . He was breathing from his nose , that 's how much wind he had left . Even so Sal wanted to keep up the fight and Hymie did n't . Boomie asked him How come you only boxed him on the defensive because you 're usually the offensive slugger . Hymie said he wanted to take it a little easy because from the chinning before he strained near his shoulder . What I said I should n't have said . I said You strained your shoulder , you did n't strain your shoulder you strained your ass . He said Do n't get me sore . I said You get sore at me and at me you can get sore but with him you would n't get sore . And Boomie said to himp184You were plenty sore with him , you got red pimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hymie went and walked ahead of us . I and Boomie talked only to each other . We did it loud so Hymie would hear . Like this we did it BOOMIE DO YOU THINK HE WAS N'T SORE AT THIS SAL ? OH NO HE WAS N'T SORE , NAH NAH NOT MUCH OH NO . MAKE A GUESS WHY HE BOXED HIM ONLY ON THE DEFENSIVE AND HE DID N'T ABSOLUTELY KICK THE SHIT OUT OF IIIM . BECAUSE THIS SAL WAS N'T A JEWISH KID A JEWISH KID HE WOULD N'T WORRY BUT WITH A GINZO HE WORRIES . Hymie stopped walking and he said Did I win it , I won it . I and Boomie told him he won it but with a Jewish kid he would n't just win it he would kick the shit out of the guy also . Hymie said How about when I had the fight with Vinnie Luginio , I had two fights with Vinnie Luginio both times I kicked the shit out of him , he 's a ginzo . I told him Vinnie lives in a Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish kids , he 's like not really a ginzo . Hymie said What do I have to do I have to go to Italy and kick the shit out of Mussolini . He walked fast and got way ahead of us . We walked a little faster just to follow but not to catch up . From two blocks away we saw him go by himself into the movies . When we went in we looked but did n't see him . Then in the Coming Attractions we noticed him move and change his seat to nearer the front . We heard him laugh when we laughed . Even so it spoiled Sequoia for us . We did n't even feel like seeing it twice so we went out and Hymie went out with us . We then made up.  |p185A|pril  28 , 1938Cousin Phillie came over in his car . As it was very nice out he rode us to Prospect Park . I was sitting up in the front and I said Cousin Phillie how fast could you go with this car . Mom said I should leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you let him concentrate . Cousin Phillie said I can answer him a little question AND I can concentrate . Mom said If I sing in a quiet way would that interfere with your concentration . Cousin Phillie said Sing go ahead with the greatest pleasure . Mom said To give you less trouble and more concentrationtell me if I should sing If I Had My Life To Live Over I 'd Never Do It Again or if I should sing Tears From The Orphans Eyes . Cousin Phillie said Whatever you sing is good enough and it would n't bother my concentration . Mom said I would sing them both except they remind me too too much how you mishandled me when I worked for you in Hartford Connecticut and the way you sent me to your Cousin Droodel the dentist and he handed me a bill I said to him Cousin Droodel you put down for a filling and a cleaning but where do you get off with a dollar twentynineentertainment and he told me what 's the matter Malvena , you forgot I had on the radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to walk . April 29 , 1938 In assembly there was a show . Marion Blechman and Bert Sissler sang some Naughty Marietta songs . When Marion Blechman bowed the top of her tits showed and a whole bunch in the front clapped andp186clapped so she had to keep bowing . Also Larry Himmelfarb did imitations . His best one is Wallace Beery , he made it like Wallace Beery is rubbing his nose and throwing the snot on the floor . Mr. Stock wanted us to work out on the bars and do tumbles . We did it for fifteen minutes then we made up to ask him testicle questions . Artie Binswanger said he had a cousin who lifted weights and once when he was doing it he got a pain in his testicles . Mr. Stock said first of all his cousin should see a doctor for that might mar him for later life and also he would guess the cousin had not taken jock strap precautions . Artie said How is it horses do all kinds of lifting and strainingand pulling and they jump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves on the testicles . Mr. Stock gave a good answer , How do you know , did you ever ask a horse . April 30 , 1938I handed in my digest of an article . When Miss Hochman collected them she just happened to look at mine because it was the top one . She said Oh what I see , shame on Simon . What I did was instead of conceive I wrote concieve . The article I did the digest of was Men With Wings And Guns by Berne Teague about how airplane gunners get trained . This reminds me that I again saw Marshey who I always think of when I see about airplanes . This was yesterdaymorning , he turned around his books so I should notice he has a slide rule . I said to him What have you got there , is that your lunch ? He said Hi Shimmy hi what do you say and I answered him in the way he talks . What do I say ? I 'll TELL you what I say , I say SHMUK . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away it gave me sad feelings . In fact I knew it would even before I said it but I wanted to getp187the power over him . What 's now interesting is if I think about it I still have my sad feeling and not so much because I said shmuk to him but because I 'm not positive anyway I got the power over him . Never mind . May 1 , 1938Boomie is maybe trying to get the power over me . Im not sure . I and he went to buy loosies in the Sweet Shop and C.D. was with Faye Citrin and Rhoda Barsky and a girl I do n't know . They were having a malted and I said to C.D. Hows the malted . She said it was too sweet . Right away then Boomie said to me Faye has a fantastic pair of tits , they were big even in public school . But C.D. has no tits and her both tits together could fit one corner of Faye Citrin 's brassiere . I fell in , my voice got chokey . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want from me . And there 's more important things with a girl then her tits . Boomie gave me a look . So what I did was talk like Boomie talks when he does his Ronald Colman voice . Yes ah yes my friend there are ah there are more ah important things ah with a girl than ah her tits . He had to do the voice if I did it . It 's hard exactly to explainbut anyway he had to . What ah what is more ah importantwith a girl than her ah tits ah . I answered him Her ah cunt ah . He wanted to give a real laugh but he went only Ha Ha Ha . I think and I 'm naturally not positive it 's because he just just missed getting power over me . Miss Hochman gave back my Men With Wings And Guns digest with a Really Excellent and a star . The star was to read to the class but there was no time.  |p188May  2 , 1938I and C.I . ate together in the cafeteria . What happened is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I saw she was looking and looking and waiting and I yelled Here here . Mom 's sandwich I kept on the inside of the bag so the whole thickness would n't show and I ate it by tearing off only little hunks . I said to her What you are eating smells good . She said Have some I 'll give you some . I was nervous I would have to eat from her mouth . But what she did was smart , she took out from the inside of the sandwich and put it on my chala . There then happened what I would definitely say is the most embarrassing moment of my life . I said to her This I love , I love greebin . So she asked me What 's greebin , what 's that . I told her I was not probably pronouncing it exactly in the right Jewish , maybe it 's not greebin it 's groobin . Groobin or greebin , she did n't know . I said Groobin or greebin is what you call it when you take the pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . She got all red and I think I got all red . She then told me , her exact words I forget , I did n't hear as I got a pop and a whistling in my ears , how what she gave me was bacon . I made up something that in my house my mother when she makes bacon uses probably another kind and type of bacon . She said that in her house it was absolutely not kosher and I said in my house we 're practically not kosher . I made up also that my parents , I called them MY FOLKS , keep their little bit of kosher not because they believe in it really but not to hurt my grandparents and that my grandfatheris like a rabbi . She said it was sort of the same thing with her grandparentsp189and her folks used to have big fights and arguments with them on being kosher and going to shul and her grandparents wo n't eat in her house . When they come they bring all their own stuff , their own plates even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're kosher and I mentioned how being kosher has nothing to do with God , it goes back to when certain animals and certain fish had diseases thousands and thousands of years ago and the Jews then made up kosher rulings not to catch the diseases . So C.D. said My parents are n't kosher because they do n't believe in God . We then got in a discussion on the difference between an athiest and an agnostic and I said You 're always better off being an agnostic because an agnostic is almost an athiest but just in case there 's a God he would n't turn out such a shmoo . For shmoo I nearly said shmuk . She said My parents are Marxists . I think I must have gone Ahah , like she said her parents were blind . She maybe noticed because she said Well I am sorry if they are Marxists , that is what they are . I said I think I will have that next term , next term I am taking History for a fifth major . She started kidding me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what Karl Marx said . She said to me So who was Karl Marx and I kidded her back , I said Who was Karl Marx , I 'll TELL you who was Karl Marx . SURE . He was the son of Old Man Marx . She said You ought to read the book I read on it , it 's not really ON it but sort of . Jews Without Money . What I did was I wrote down the name , but in a scribble , then I said I would look to see if it was on the supplemental reading list Miss Hochman gave us . When the first bell rang we got pushed together and I hadp190a feel off her ass . Twice I jerked off on it , the first time I made her Anne Shirley the second time Jean Parker . May 3 , 1938I looked up in the encyclopedia under Marxism , they did n't have too much . It said see Communism , but a guy just beat me to the Cs . Jews Without Money they did n't have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before I forget I 'll put the author down as its funny . Mike Gold . They had it in the public library only it was under Closed Shelf . Fuck it and never mind . More on May 3 , 1938Why I wrote never mind is because I did n't feel yesterday like doing what you have to do when they have a book in Closed Shelf . You have to go the librarian yourself to ask her and I did n't want to say Jews . May 5 , 1938Today I shaved with the door open . Mom and Dad looked . Mom cried , Dad said a mazel tuff . Dad gave me a new blade to put in the razor , also he gave me his brush to use and witch hazel and he put down a piece of styptic pencil . He then went and got me his nail clippers and his fine comb and his Polymol and he put on a towel talcum and he showed me how I should use it after the shave . He had me shut the door and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's becoming a man has to be alone on his first big boy shave . He asked me Sonny what else do you want and tell me if you need something . While I was shaving I thought I heard noise but I was n't sure as the door was closed and I had the both faucets on . When I finished I could n't get the door open and I had top191push and push . Dad had put there all his coats and all his suits and his two belts and his bathrobe and he told me I should take what I want , I should even take his life . The only thing is I should n't take his life for the next few days as he did n't want to leave the manager short handed . Mom cried , she noticed on a pair of pants the cleaner did n't clean out under the cuffs . May 6 , 1938Yesterday and the whole Saturday morning I did n't talk to Dad . Even when he went to shul I would n't go with Mom and wave from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , just half a piece matzo with cream cheese and milk . Mom wanted to know how come I ate hardly a breakfast just just just half a piece matzo with cream cheese and milk . On account of him I told her , on account of he 's a filthy rat and a dirty louse and a hunk of shit and he should only drop dead . Mom cried and she opened the window I should say again what I said and the whole whole world should hear how it paid them to have a child , she was under labor with me for three days on her dropped stomach and the Daddy on his hernia had to break up ice for her ice bag . I could n't answer , I got very chokey . She said Go go and I said I 'm going I 'm going and she said I want you to go , go go and I said I 'll go I 'll go and she said Go go already and I said Do n't you worry I 'm going I 'm going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit because I 'm going and she said Go go and you should only live not to come back and I said The same to you and to him that hunk of shit do n't worry I 'm going I 'm going . I then went and got all dressed and I took my Bio and my French books . Mom said So where you going.  |p192I  told her either I would get a room or either I would move in by Boomie . She said a room is a better idea , it 's always the best best thing not to move in by the next one , what 's the matter I forgot already when she moved in with Cousin Phillie in Hartford Connecticut . I told her goodby and I had nothing really aginst her but I was just just sick and tired of him , the lousy hunk of shit . She said Believe me a room is n't a bad idea if the room is where I would n't have to walk the five flights , it would n't hurt if I got away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us a slightly slightly bigger room with kitchen privilege and I 'd go back to my old passementerie line , what 's the matter and why not , Puritz and Sachs would take me in a minute . I waited for her to get dressed and we both looked in three two family houses but we did n't see any rooms she liked . On the way back Sacramento was just putting a sign in the window Bon Ami 4 for 28  --  . Teitlebaum saw us with the Sacramento bag , he said Do n't ask no more to sharpen your knives on my grinder . May 7 , 1938 I and Boomie and Hymie went on the boardwalk . As we did n't go yesterday to the movies we had the money and we went to Steeplechase , ten rides a quarter . Most of the rides are shit , just the horses and the sliding pond we liked . Where we had fun was the barrel . It 's not even really a ride , it just turns and shakes you , but they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows up the girls dresses with an air thing . One girl had on no bloomers and we yelled PUSSY . I noticed and Boomie too her pussy hair was a darker color then on her head . Hymie said Who looked at the head.  |p193On  one other girl we saw a hole in the bloomers , she cried . We had then like an adventure . A man came over and told us he likes to buy young fellows frozen custard and talk with them about young fellow problems . We answered him like Marshey . Sure , why not , SURE . And we then all went out together and he bought us frozen custard , the double . He said Well who wants to talk first about his young fellow problem and we made him first get us a hot corn each . He sat on a bench with us and when we ate the hot corn we kidded around by wiping our hands on his jacket . This made him laugh and laugh . He then just like that said Do you know young fellows that masturbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit and Boomie said Oy Oy Thank God . The guy told us a lot of young fellows have masturbation problems , it 's one of the biggest young fellow problems he noticed in his experience . They think it will give them weakness . Hymie right away made believe he fainted . The guy said It would be my pleasure to help you out in a discussion of any of your masturbation problems , that kind of thing you ca n't talk over with your moms and pops . I said What are you talking about , I and my pop do it together . Boomie said They do it together and his mom loves to watch . The guy made himself laugh and laugh , he pumped it up the way Boomie can pump up a belch and he copped feels from us . Mostly he felt Hymie , I was even a little jealous . He wanted to know if we wanted to go to his room , he had a big big room in the Half-Moon where we could all stretch out and learn from him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us watermelon slices , the large.  |p194Then  we gave him an argument , Hey where are the napkins , you forgot the napkins , and when he went to get the napkins he put his hat on the bench , it was a panama hat , and we spit out the pits in it . He told us he had a lot of sweeties in his room and also he would give us fifteen cents apiece to go to the movies . We told him we wanted to go to the Brooklyn Fox , there it 's a quarter on Sunday . He said Well if that will give you pleasure all right , for I get my pleasure when I can give young fellows like you pleasure . We let him for a little while cop feels off Hymie , then we told him we did n't know and we were n't sure and we were a little bit nervous and we wanted to talk and discuss in private . He said While you talk about it I will go and buy a lot more sweeties for the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back he gave us toffee . We ate it all and we told him the toffee made us thirsty , get us soda . So he got us soda and we told him on account of he was very very nice to us we wanted to reciprocate and we would n't charge him a quarter apiece . I started to say We 'll charge you only a dime apiece and I started in to laugh and shpritz out soda , Boomie had to finish . He said Not even a dime , we 'll charge you only a nickel apiece , for a nickel apiece we 'll all piss on you , and we all three ran like anything . We ran practically to Ocean Parkway even though the guy was n't running after . Boomie figured we were maybe shmuks not to go with the guy , that if we asked him a half a buck he 'd give us a half a buck . We went on Bay 6 a while . As the sun was very strong we took off our shirts and our undershirts . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sorry we did n't have on bathingsuits . All of a sudden it jumped in my mind how I am married to C.D. and she is in the water , a big fat yenta with boobies down to her bush . Never mind and no more.  |p195May  8 , 1938I last night had a wet dream . I was in the movies and my seat was like the wrong way , I could see just the wall . A girl then came over and instead of in the movie we were on the trolley but the trolley was more the subway , it said De Kalb Avenue . The girl looked sort of like a girl from a picture Teitlebaum had by his register , the girl is standing with a cow and she 's drinking milk from a pail . I sucked on her tits , then when she was letting me push in my cock something happened , she had to go on another trolley or she had to go back to the movies . I shot when I was practically wide awake . In Home Room we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time it 's the same thing . Somebody says I nominate Hitler and somebody says I nominate Clark Gable or somebody says I propose hereby Mae West or my nomination is Mickey Finn for his fine police work . The most votes in our class were for Senator Wagner . C.D. was absent today from French . This is maybe when she gets the period . I got the thought that this would be interesting , how we both on the same identical day get emptied out . May 9 , 1938 I had a fight with Dad in the morning . He got up early with me , he had to say yizker for his mother and we had breakfast together . He was reading the Forvitz and he read to Mom how there 's a story they would like more Jews to go to Palestine . This got him sore , he said That 's all they want and that 's all I need , I 'll listen to them and I 'll leave a manager like my manager and I 'll go live with the African shvartzers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in Harlem they wear snappy stuff , without them the spats industry would be finished years ago.  |p196I  said to him Palestine is nowhere nowhere near Africa , Palestine is the Middle East . He said How come you were a baby and you never let me nowheres near you and until you were four if we took you to the next one 's house you looked for where they had up calendarsand you ripped the pages . He threw at me pot cheese and cream and Mom then got a dropped stomach attack . I went out I did n't even take my lunch . Dad came running after with it and I had to take it from him because Marshey was across the street and I did n't want a whole scene . Dad like wanted to make up , he said What do you need Palestine , you got right here the most beautiful beaches in the world , you get sick of these beaches so what , it 's a stone 's throw and you go over to Rockaway . May 1o , 1938Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one story the whole period practically . How he was in France and he wanted to go to a certain street in Paris and he goes around asking and asking how you get to the street , and every body he asks just just looks at him . What happened was he had not done the pronunciation of the street from up in his nose , he had a cold . He said it came out as if here you wantedOCEAN PARKWAY but you said ORGAN PARKWAY , and this gotthe absolutely biggest laugh . So Mr. Wexler told us I was referring to the INSTRUMENT , this made it worse . Lenny Roseman had to leave the room . It was announced in English we are going to have a debate . Miss Hochman put a bunch of topics in the wastebasket andone from every row picked . My row got WAS IT RIGHT TO MURDER JULIUS CAESAR . I raised my hand and asked a goodquestion . That if you use the word murder before you even debate you right away are practically losing the debate as murder has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she changed it to assassinate . We have a week from today to prepare . C.D. came late to the cafeteria , she had her gym before and the teacher kept them past the bell . The only thing that was good from this is I had time to finish my sandwich . For a second she scared the shit out of me . She said I said hello to you Sunday on the boardwalk , you did n't notice . I thought oY she saw me with that guy , but it was when we were on the beach . I made her laugh after . She said I guess to make conversation What were you doing on the beach , I answered her We were Jews without money . May 11 , 1938This week definitely will be dirty week . It used to happen especially in junior high , there would be a whole week where whatever you said or anybody said it would turn into somethingdirty . In English therefore today Josh Berzoff went to the blackboardto write his descriptive paragraphs . All the boys had to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like reporters of a party . He put on one paragraph with a sentence Carl Hubbell burned his ball in . Miss Hochman said Now this sentence has a color verb but I think I see something wrong with the color verb usage , does anyone see what I notice . What she meant we had a couple of weeks ago , that you could use a colloquialism but to use it you have to use it right and with grammar even if to you it 's only a colloquialism . Like here Josh had burned his ball in , the colloquialism to be used right is burned IN the ball . So she said again Josh what 's wrong with that , do you see , look at it again and tell me if you see . He got nervous , he like fumfed Carl Hubbell burned the ball , Carl Hubbell had his ball in burning , boobooboo , CarlHubbell HAD A BURNING BALL.  |p198We  would have probably only laughed a little , but NormeyLevan yells out That 's why he pitched such a lousey game . Then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodI think you should expect a little testy tomorrow , that 's whatshe said exactly . Boomie fixed me up good , he passes me anote A TESTY IS ONE BALL FROM A MIDGET . Dad 's shul had a tora party , I forget what they call it in Jewish . When somebody donates a tora and they celebrate . Mom made me go with Dad to develop closeness , also she had to clean out her shopping bags and it gets her nervous if people are in the house . For five blocks almost he did n't open his mouth and I did n't open my mouth . Then we were by the Knishe Queen he finally tells me I 'm warning you do n't step into that shmutz , watch out with your brand new shoes . I said What watch out , its nowheres nowheres near me , it 's in the gutter practically . He said That 's where you 're all along headed and that 's where you 'll end up . I answered him in a fresh way You should also . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't have lived to be born and he said in Jewish it 's either a crime or a shame the earth carries me and he would be better off if he had instead shot his load in the kitchen sink . Old Man Faygeles then came over from across the street , he said NU NU Shmuel . Dad answered him Nu NU back and say hello to my kaddishel . I saw Marshey 's father in shul . He said How come you and Marshall are n't no more such good friends , you two used to be such good friends . I answered something about we have different interests or now we do n't have exactly the same interests . He said What can you do and that 's what it is , in America it 's the easiest thing to grow apart , over nothing people can break up . You see two kids the best of friends ,  |p199then  it happens one has to travel the Sea Beach Line and one has to travel the Brighton Line and its fartig and its finished and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to kid around that anyway at our age and stage I and Marshey should have just just one interest . Thank God they started putting out the delicatessen as I was becoming embarassed . How I felt was like once in Boomie 's house his father told him You had to wet the toilet seat , what 's the matter , your thing is big enough that you can take good aim . May 12 , 1938Boomie was sick and Hymie had to go to Tumbling practice . I forgot to put down he 's on the Tumbling Squad . Anywayit worked out that I went alone to the Sweet Shop for loose cigarettes and C.D. came in after . She looked for her friends and they were n't there . She therefore did n't feel like hanging around for them and we ended up walking together . C.D. had a bag of pistachio nuts and we shared . We then decided to go on the beach and I said I will show you The Secret Way , and she said Oh I obey oh Master Master . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean Parkway to Bay 5 under the boardwalk and I and she made echoes with yelling . When I yelled Heil Hitler she said Do n't do that , that you should n't do and she wanted me to yell All Power To The Soviets but I instead made it Tyrone Powers Clothes Are Wet . Also we sang a whole bunch of public school songs , Welcome Sweet Springtimeand Poor Punchinello The Clown and Ancient Of Days and Holy Holy Holy . I let her all by herself sing Shipmates Stand Together and from the song I had a very sad feeling . In my imagination I and Boomie and Hymie were on a battleshipand the battleship was sinking and we had our arms around each others shoulders . The thing that gave me thep200sad feeling was my thought of come on stop the shit , what kind of shit with battleships , where do you come to battleships , you know what you are , what you are is just just just a Jewish boy from Brighton , you 'll get a job where you have to shit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother , when he got married he moved in across the hall from his mother . Not even really across the hall , his mother is in 2J and he 's in 2H . So when she was doing a high note I pushed down my sad feeling by singing in a mockey way I Am A Yankee Doodle Father , I Got A Yankee Doodle Son , He Works Downtown For Three Dollars A Week , He 's Honest Like Washington , Last Night He Brought Me Home The Pay Dear , I Saw It Was A Quarter Shy , Hub Ich Der Totten Gayben Aym Kloppin , Ikey 's Got a Shikse On The Sly . C.D. started to get sore . She kicked sand on me and she said You know that 's not nice , I do n't think that 's nice . I imitated her Not Nice Not Nice , Nyeh Nyeh Nyeh . She said You never should say shikser , she hates and detests it when Jews say shikser or shvartzer and they should n't do it , they ought to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when they are called sheenie and kike . I made up like a joke , What song do you think of or what song would you sing if a shikse and a shvartzer got married and I sang then Thats How Darkies Are Born . She went Oh really and I went Not Oh really Oh Reilly . So she kicked more sand on me , it even got in my hair . She said That 's your trouble , you know what your main and basic trouble is , you 're not SERIOUS . I could n't help it and it just came out . SURE I 'm not serious , how can I be serious , I 'm JEWISH . She said to me Are you going to be serious . Be SERIOUS and she gave me a little smack on the chest . I made believe we were sort of boxing and I by accident landed a soft one right in the tit . Like with the back or top of fingers . Naturallyp201I could n't help it that I got a feel for a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I would get a hardon , I already could could feel a semi and I had to do in my throat Baruch Attuh , keep it down oy pussy booboo peepee periods . My exact exact words were then That I did n't mean , seriously , I am being serious . She said Oh sure you 're Serious but it does n't mean you 're Sincere . A person can be absolutely serious but who says even if he 's serious he 's sincere . I kissed my pinkie and I grabbed her hand and I kissed her pinkie . Definitely she did n't want me to let go her hand so I held on and we walked practically to Bay 3 . As we both had sand in our shoes what we did was take off our shoes and I in one hand carried the both pair of shoes and she in one hand carried our books . A couple of times we almost tripped where the sand got hilly or it had holes but she held on and I held on . I had the feeling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swimming with his mate , they 're teasing with turtles in the water . Where you absolutely do n't want to think about how before they went in he fucked her probably . We sat down by the rocks and even to sit down we kept the grip . In fact we even tickled palms , I did n't remember till now . I then lit a cigarette , not so much that I wanted to smoke but I wanted to let go her hand already . I asked if she wanted a puff , she said she once or twice tried it but its bad for her sinus . She got up and I got up and we both wet our feet a little . We both for no reason started to sing the Marsellaise , then she yelled very loud like over the ocean You prisoners of starvation hello , how are you , oh I love you you prisoners of starvation . I without realizing started in the way Marshey talks , Youp202LOVE the prisoners of starvation , all right SURE , I am starving . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself very stiff and put your elbows very very tight by your chest . Right away she did it , it was interesting that she did n't say why should I or what do I have to . With my palms only I did the trick , I lifted her way up and when I put her down I again got her in the tit . Actually I got only brassiere but it gave me really a hardon . What I did was get on my stomach in the sand and grind down . Something struck me funny , that if the earth is round there could be right now a guy exactly opposite me from the other end of the world and he 's doing the same thing . C.D. lay down also on her stomach and she asked me if you could make everything ideal and perfect what would it be for you ? In other words what would you want to be able to do that now you ca n't do . I did my Ronald Colman , My deehah , I would wahant to behah herehah forevah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being serious . I told her naturally I would want to be able to do what every body wants to do , they would want to do things to be happy , they would want a million dollars I would want a million dollars . She said But ideally how would you be happy , what would be for you the IDEAL happiness . So I said For me and just just for me , in other words you do n't want me to say I want a million dollars . She said Only what you Simon Sloan the individual dream about ideally , your ideal dream . I wanted her to tell me first and she wanted me to tell her first so we chose and she lost . She said What I would want and my ideal dream is for the world to be the kind of world where if a person needs it , letsp203say we would need it , even if we did n't absolutely need it , we just wanted it because it was nice , then we should be able to go to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , my hands are dirty and I would like to if you do n't mind wash them in your sink and they should n't mind . In other words I would n't necessarily do that but it should he the kind and type of a world where if I wanted to I would be ABLE to do it . All I could think of for my turn had to do with the movies . I would sleep in the movies and I would eat in the movies and the world is fixed up in a way that I never never have to get out of the movies . What I did I made up a bunch of shit . There should n't be more wars and this should be a REALLY free country for every body and that something would be done for the ordinary man , for the little people . The little people thing I got from Mr. Deeds Goes To Town . That she definitely liked . How I know is she took my hand and she dribbled sand on it so I dribbled sand on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was aiming for there and probably if it was n't the beach I could have given her more shit and tried for a finger fuck . Only people already were coming out by Parkway Baths . Also I was thinking , it annoyed me , the real real crappy shit you have to do if you want to get laid . She then talked chokey we should get started . So we carriedour shoes and we put them on on the boardwalk steps . Going back we just kidded around and we talked about school . I bought a charlotte russe and I had the woman cut it in half , I almost then said something she should have the cherry , I did n't . We had sort of a race from the boardwalk to Brighton Beach Avenue , I kept up with her easy . To say good bye we shook hands and we swung them back and forthrand we sang Did You Ever See A Lassie . I now will put down C.D.s name . Her name is Clare Dushler.  |p204May  13 , 1938 Mom and Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me supper separate , I wanted hard eggs mashed up and Dad wanted them chopped up . Dad said to me You know it do n't look bad the way you 're eating the egg , why not , I would also eat it that way if I had a mother a slaving servant for taking advantage on , after all it 's coming to you , first she mashes with a spoon and then she mashes with a fork , that 's the way and it 's your America . I went like Please or Jeez . Mom told me God should only only forgive you the way you talk to a father . Then she said to Dad Bite your tongue and grind down hard , who asked you and who needs you butting in moron dopey person with your peculiar ways , he gets himself an upset stomach he paints his throat with argyrol . Dad answered her I ca n't help it , it hurts me he sits there that everything is coming to him , I do n't mind you 're a crazy mother and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only remember you got a husband and your husband needs you , save me a little strength in coming years , the momzer murdererwants russian type dressing let him mix himself the mayonnaise and the ketchup . I said like Tzoo or Tzahsh . Mom said You 're listening Shmuel , Shmuel listen how she 's working on him , it did n't take her long to turn him alreadyagainst the parents . I said She , who she and what she . Mom said the older girl who poisoned your mind . Dad said Go mix him up more mayonnaise and ketchup . Mom said Since he was a kid he was the same way , any any woman could wrap him around , do n't I remember , those things you do n't do n't forget how we went to the beach and with me he would n't sit , he ran over to be on Mrs. Scheindlitzer'sblanket . What what what she wanted from him shep205could get , for me he would n't carry a shopping bag but for her he 'd go kidnap the Lindbergh baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use her big tube . Dad said Bruno Hauptman also had a Jackie Cooper face . Mom said I did n't know when I gave birth to you in a dry labor for three days how you 'd turn out a moron for the maidluch . I asked her where maidluch and what maidluch . Mom said You want the story I 'll give you the story from me you 'll hear it straight simple sincere . A certain certain party that is to me a true blue friend and feels for my suffering , if I told you the name you 'd know in a minute , is very very grateful to me . What I did for her is n't a story for now , how this true blue party had a daughter , a brilliant girl , and the daughter wanted to belong to the library and they asked her in the library if she would give them one one reference signature and everybody turned her down . Her own brother told her I do n't sign nothing for nobody , that 's his roughneckgrammar , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came to Malvena the Orphan for the signature . And because I did her that favor my true blue friend is since then looking out for my interest . That 's why she just just just happened to be looking out from her bathroom windowand she saw you near Brighton Beach Avenue with an old looking girl , she even figured it was me and for the second she could n't recognize me that I got so old looking . I said A girl from my class , from in my class I know her , a girl . Dad said Sure and definitely and who 's denying , that 's how Loeb and Leopold got to know Bobby Franks , he was also in their class . Mom said I do n't blame the woman , a woman gets to a certain age she goes for young kids , they had the same thing in a William Powell picture , the reason I say William Powellp206is I understand your elderly lady looked like William Powell only her nose was bigger . Dad said I 'll tell you something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , I 'm finished with him . Morn said Shmuel do n't talk that way you 're a father give him another chance , he 's a young kid and he does n't does n't know . Dad said Right now I 'm ready to tear him out of my life , I lost a father I can lose him . Mom said Just just just give him one one more chance , let him promise he wo n't see her no more and if she comes over he 'll say in a nice way get going lady or lady get going . Dad said I 'm starting my Kaddish on him , get set , YisgadalVyiskadash . Mom said Everything will be fine , he wo n't see her no more , we 'll get some loose ice cream , you 'll go down Shimmy you 'll get half a pint loose ice cream . Dad said Shmay Rabuh . Mom said go go go to Gelfman , it 's all over , it 's finished , it 's forgotten , half a pint , watch how he packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strawberry Shmah Rabuh only strawberry do n't give me heartburn . I had to go all the way to Teshler , Gelfman had no strawberry . May 14 , 1938Senator Wagner is getting the Lowell Award , Hank Greenbergwas second . On account of last night I had a bad mood and it lasted into Bio . Mrs. Jacobey was showing us about one celled life and also the life cycle , everything that 's in nature is used for somethingand even when any kind of life is dead it goes in the soilp207or in the air or in the water where it gets used again . She said this is one of the marvels of old mother nature . Naturally we were all supposed to be putting it down in our notebook . What I did , I closed up my fountain pen , then I put it on the desk with a bang . Mrs. Jacobey right away noticed and asked me if do n't I think that something which will possibly show up on the final is worth writing down or does one of the marvels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages it engages . Mrs. Jacobey said I might say Simon I am surprised , I am hurt and somewhat surprised you show lack of respect for me , for the class , and for mother nature . I then knew I had the power over her . All of a sudden . This is hard to explain and never mind . I told her I 'm sorry , I apologize to you and to the class but I do n't apologize to mother nature and I would like to explain my exact feelings about mother nature . Mrs. Jacobey then asked the class because it was class time Shall we listen to Simon explain about mother nature ? The whole class clapped and went yay , Boomie went My hah franz . I got up in the front and I faced the class , the feeling I had was anything I 'd say I could n't go wrong . I said Mrs. Jacobey and fellow class members , we have been learning about and discussing the mysteries and marvelsof mother nature . But it seems to me there are definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we should say it is so marvelous . For if we think , if we realize mother nature could have in absolutely any way she wanted and desired set up various and differing kinds of laws , in other words instead of having life die and get used again and again , mother nature had nothing to stop her from taking human beings and working it out or so working out another way or system whereby for example man could be immortal . That is he need not and would n't have to die ,  |p208mother  nature could arrange for him more important things and laws then to be a fertilizer . Therefore why should we say MARVELOUS mother nature , what is so marvelous about mother nature , what kind of favors did she do for us such as keeping and preventing us from getting illness . What did she do for us so MARVELOUS that she did n't do for the amoebas ? Mrs. Jacobey clapped and the class also right away clapped . Boomie went Hooray for our side . Mrs. Jacobey said Simon that was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we will probably be covering in a few weeks . I have only one criticism , look up the plural for amoeba . After class I went up to see her in the excuse that I wanted to know the plural of amoeba but really to get more praise . She told me why do n't you write that up for the Lowell Lantern . I promised her I would try . The next class was however French and Mr. Wexler there gave me all of a sudden a question in fast French for which I was paying no attention . I later answered three questions nobody else could answer , one he said Formidable Monsieur Sloan . That did not even so cancel out and do away with when I missed . As I walked to Study Period Clare went to Gym and she mentioned what a nice time she had on the beach but she could n't eat her supper , it was my fault . I said How was it my fault ? She told me I had spoiled her appetite by giving her that charlotte russe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not being serious , after all who forced me to eat the charlotterusse if I did n't want it and I knew it would spoil my appetite . I told my mother and my mother said I think you did right to eat it even if it spoiled your appetite because you never want to unnecessarily hurt the feelings of a fellow . I could n't stand it , the way she made with her mouth and the way she made with her tongue and the way she madep209with her chin when she said fellow . It came out FELL All and she looked older then Hymie 's bubbee . In Study Period I started to write up my thing from Bio . My power was gone . I later felt bad at my annoyance with Clare because she came to our cafeteria table with three sandwichesof lettuce and tomato , one of them was for me definitely . We even so had an argument about my Julius Caesar debate , she said , her exact words , Assassination in certain cases and instances can have a very healthy effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you said and do you know what you said . She said So what , you know what I meant , you only look for something not to be serious about . May 15 , 1938I and Boomie and Hyrnie went to the Surf . They brought back Captains Courageous with Magnificent Brute and they had the last chapter of Flash Gordon . Boomie got us almost thrown out with Captains Courageous . This was the part in the end where Spencer Tracy gets killed , he 's like trapped in the water and you see him only from the top . Underneath he 's supposed to be all bashed in . Boomie went all of a suddenOy it hurts mine balls , oy do mine balls hurt , oy watch out for mine balls . After we walked on the boardwalk . The ski ball in the penny arcade was broken and we got each three games on the one nickel . We could have gotten even more but there was a commotion on the boardwalk and we went to see . What it was is a cop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God he could n't catch her , that 's how fast she was even with the baby carriage . Why he could get her is only because the carriage got tipped over in the sand and she went back to hit people for grabbing her pollyseeds . The cop said I know you lady , I seen you from before , you like to make trouble for me , you like to peddle without a license.  |p210Yenta  Gersh talked in Jewish to a lady and the lady told the cop in English , Officer she do n't understand English , her English ai n't too good , from one word of English she do n't understand . Yenta Gersh grabbed the lady and she whispered in her ear something . The lady said She do n't want to be a liar for you officer , maybe a word and one word maybe she 'll understand . Yenta Gersh like stuck up a finger and she said Depretzon . The cop said I give you summons . Summons I give you , I sorry . License you no got . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boobooboo . The lady said You think that 's nice , I do n't think that 's too nice officer darling , you should n't make her a summons , a person like that , to her English is a foreign language . Yenta Gersh went on her fingers Juh Lewss hex-lex feenamintztziklitz . The lady said She do n't even know in English what she done , in English maybe she broke a law , in Yiddish she 's altogether an innocent party . The cop said You run , so why you run . The lady had to ask Yenta Gersh twice in Jewish , then she said It 's in English hard to explain , it 's like you would say it 's a nervous habit . Yenta Gersh grabbed the lady and again she whispered in her ear . The lady said in Jewish It could be that in her Jewish way she was only walking fast . The cop put away his ticket booth , he said Now no summons , I no give summons . The lady told Yenta Gersh and Yenta Gersh told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you her gratitude in English . Yenta Gersh tried and tried but she could n't express it . The lady said In Yiddish it would be you should get blessedp211by your god and she wants to call up your bosses to say how fine you acted . Yenta Gersh went Warden Lawes Warden Lawes . The cop walked away then every body walked away . Boomie got thirsty so he bought from Yenta Gersh some orange drink . He spit it right out , he claimed there was no ice in the pail and it tastes like shit . Yenta Gersh turned around , she said You do n't like the taste kiss my ass and fuck on you . May 16 , 1938 Mom did n't feel good , we went to Dr. Felkin . He examined her fifteen minutes and he said Malvena if I wanted to make from you a few dollars and if I was a sucker I 'd say come back again and I 'd give you medicine and powders . Only you do n't need medicine and you do n't need powders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , it 's one word and one word only . He wrote down A CHANGE OF PACE . He said That 's all you need , you do n't need me , save your money , I do n't want to see you any more and I do n't want to hear about you , I want you from now on to take it easy , I want you to spend on yourself , enjoy and have good times , for once be selfish , do n't be a fool , right now get out of here and change your pace . Mom said You 're right you 're right , I 'm fed up and I 'm disgusted , from now on Malvena the Orphan takes better care of herself , no more step child of the world . We started to go and Dr. Felkin walked us out , he told Mom Right now pack a little bag and get yourself a place in Fallsburg . Mom said Who needs to pack , I 'm not going to waste time packing , what I need I 'll buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p212We  went down and Mom sang a happiness song in Jewish and she danced us around by the Knishe Queen . Mom said First first first I go to the beauty parlor and I put myself in the hands of Mister Moey , what it costs it costs , I 'll tell him Mister Moey I 'm putting myself in your hands and what it costs it costs . She again danced us around and she sang in Jewish I Begged My Momma Dear To Get Up From The Grave To Make Me Some Tzimmis . Mom said The first first first train that goes to Fallsburg is the train I take , what I was is in the past and them days are gone forever , I 'm putting myself first and first I 'll put myself . Mom sang in Jewish Put The Stone By My Head It Should n't Lay Heavy On My Feet . Mom said I 'll think of myself , I 'll spend on myself , I 'll give in to myself , I 'll cater to myself . Get used to it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what you 'll get used to . We crossed over to Waxman and Mom called out Waxman , Hey Waxman you got in your window a beach chair , how much is that beach chair for me . Waxman said You got good taste , have you got good taste , good taste is what you got , let me tell you when you got it you got it and nobody can take it away from you . Mom said In my life and since I was born I never had a beach chair , now it 's high high high time . I had a mother also and if she was with me now she would tell me Malvena fool do n't wait no more , wake up and live , forget about Cousin Phillie and what you did for him , 23 years already he 's promising you a beach chair , Cousin Phillie where 's my beach chair you 're promising me 23 years , Malvena hold your horses , I want to wait till they come out already with the new models , how much is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the right right price Waxman . Waxman said I ca n't get over you got such good taste , good taste when you got it is something you 're already bornp213with and nobody can take it away from you because taste when its born in you is an inborn thing , for you the right price and the special price is $3.79 . Mom said If that 's the price that 's the price , no handling and no bargaining , that 's it and that 's it , a nickel more or a nickel less wo n't give me back my momma , I 'm not tearing your heart out for a nickel . Waxman said You know what , I 'm taking off the nickel for you and only for you and do n't tell anybody , because you know what good is , you got the knack and that 's a knack that 's born in you , if it 's born in you you got it and it 's a naturalknack . Waxman then wrapped the chair up in newspaper and he tied it around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom said Waxman put on a little newspaper . Waxman put on the whole yesterdays Mirror and a SundayJournal . Mom took one end and I took the other end and Waxman took the middle and we that way lugged it across the street and upstairs . Mom sent back Waxman for a little more newspaper to be on the safe side . Waxman brought up the Forvitz and the American and he helped Mom and me put the chair in the cedar closet on the top underneath her old Hudson seal coat . Mom after locked up the closet and the key she put in the bread box in a big jar that 's very hard to open . Then we took newspaper and we went downstairs on the stoop . Pretty soon it started to drizzle , right now even it 's drizzling . May 17 , 1938 Very very early our bell rang . A mailman gave Mom a special delivery from The Lovely Lady Program . Mom said This is it and this is it.  |p214Dad  said You want to hear something , you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , I 'm telling you this is it . Mom first put on the girdle before she opened it and Dad said Hey Malvena the Celebrity . Mom when she opened the letter cried , it had on so many stamps . Dad said a Jewish face you do n't see on their stamps . The letter was that Mom 's postal had gotten read with interest by The Lovely Lady Program and they would like her at the studio between half past ten and eleven to try for the Lovely Lady Grand Prize . Mom said This this this is it . Dad said Mark my words that if this is n't it then what is it ? We made up I should go with Mom on the subway and while she got ready the banana and cream cheese sandwiches Dad gave me directions . Mom said That 's one thing your Daddy knows , he 'll give you step by step directions . I told Dad How many times did I make the same exact trip , I made it so so many times already by myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The whole thing I had to do . How I go on the Brighton Beach and how I stand where the last car stops and how I can get off by 34th St. or by 42nd St. because I have to either way get the same local . Dad said You got it , your step by step way is the best way it 's the only way . He all of a sudden grabbed a hanger , he tried to hit me and he yelled Tell me how come and why it is that from the day you were born I never had in you confidence . Mom then came out , she had on the dress from my bar mitzva and she was putting the sandwiches in her best shoppingbag.  |p215Dad  like kissed his hand at her and he said Celebrity twirl a little . Mom got cute , she sat down and crossed her legs and posed with the shopping bag on her knee . Dad was very very chokey , he blew out his nose in the sink and he said Thank you for marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Mrs. Plaut and Mrs. Harlib , they walked us to the station . We stopped by Teitlebaum and Mom yelled in the good news . Teitlebaum said Let me give you a little something for good luck , he gave her a half sour pickle , the midget . Mrs. Harlib and Mrs. Plaut kissed us good bye and when Mom and I climbed the stairs they sang the Lovely Lady theme song , Lovely Lady I 'm Falling Madly In Love With You , Lovely Lady There 's No Concealing What Can I Do . This made Mom cry and and she wished on them that in years to come they should only only only have the strength to do similar nice things for her and hers . We had a pretty good trip . Mom got into a conversation with a man that he lost his third wife two years ago , she also used to wear undershirts . He told Mom if she came over some night to his room she could see if they fit . Also he would give her a big bunch of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make you a very happy woman . Mom at this cried , she said Believe me you 're talking to some body who could use a little happiness . The man got off at Canal St. , he has an oilcloth store . Mom wished him out of the window that every day for him should be a Grand Opening . As we did n't eat really a decent breakfast , we were in such a rush , we ate our sandwiches when we got to 42nd St. on the local side . Mom started talking to the old man who ran the newsstand in Jewish , she told him about her dropped stomach and he let her sit and eat in his booth . We then went to 47th St. near Broadway , we had no no trouble finding the building . They had inside an arrow point/ing to a special elevator for Lovely Lady and when we got off a good looking goyish guy , he was exactly like Buster Crabbe , asked to see her letter . He said Good very good and May I welcome you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help make a lovely lady lovelier still . He gave Mom a cellophane bag with a little mirror and a little comb and a little piece of the Lovely Lady Soap , everything had on it Sample Only , retail sale in any form is prohibited by law . Mom said to him Thank you very very much Mr. Gorgeous Dimples , do n't you worry perfect specimen , if I should only only win your grand prize I 'll take very good care of you , you like paper plates you 'll get paper plates in all colors , just just check me on my feeling , my feeling is that from my postal they 'll have for me a few few little questions about Hartford Connecticut , do n't do n't tell me let me be surprised , you like paper cups for your whiskey , I got them with or without handles but only only in white , also you could ask me anything about the movie stars , my Cousin Phillie grew up with Warren Hymer , so what if they 're white , white is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey you 're not going to notice colors . The guy winked at her and he looked over where he had her down on a list . He said Well fine Malvena , we 're all here to have a fine time and a fine time is what we shall have , all of us Malvena , say Malvena is truly a lovely name for a lovely lady . An usher took us in to where they do the broadcasting , he was also like Buster Crabbe . Mom sat right in the front , she kept whispering and poking and poking and whispering . She said in Jewish to reach over , it 's only two rows , what does it hurt , it 's like a brand new paper , that 's one one thing I have to say for the goyim and for that I love them , they finish up reading a paper they leave it in beautiful beautiful shape . I looked around , I told Mom they have letters also , thep217whole bunch of women had the same exact kind of letter . Mom did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the master of ceremonies , hello Lanny Shaw , how are you Mr. Sweet Voice . He sang the Lovely Lady Song , then they flashed a sign Fifteen Minutes To Air Time and he went down with a microphonewhere we sat . Everyone clapped and yelled Come to me Come to me , Mom yelled louder . He like did a little dance over and he sang the Lovely Lady Song in Mom 's face . Mom cried and he gave her a Lovely Lady face tissue box , the small . Then he said to her Pray tell me Lovely Lady , what is your name . Mom answered him Malvena Sloan . He said A lovely name for a Lovely Lady , and where , pray tell , do you live lovely lady . Mom told him 1896 Brighton 5th St. , it 's already seventeenyears and if I 'm a lucky lovely lady today and God should only only spare me that 's it and that 's it , I have no more strength on my dropped stomach for 31/2 rooms , although I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never get again . He said Well that 's a grand Lovely Lady Malvena , and let 's have a great big hand for cross ventilation . An usher came over and he gave Mom a dollar bill . Mom said That 's all , how come that 's all , I answered two questions , since when do you get away with two questions for a dollar . The usher said We 'll make an adjustment outside Lovely Lady . We went with him and then he did it real fast , he locked the door behind us . Mom went to the guy by the elevator , she grabbed his tie . I started pulling her , I said Mom do n't do that and that she should n't do , will you just just just do n't do that , and the more I pulled the more she grabbed the tie.  |p218I  then , I myself and me started to cry , I swear to God I have n't cried since I first met Hymie and he won me in a wrestle . Mom told the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what you and your people lost , you lost me for an audience , you lost my husband 's whole society and when I finish believe me you can kiss Brighton Beach good bye . Finally finally I pulled her off his tie and I pushed her in an elevator . She said to the guy From now on drink your whiskey out of glasses . Almost to the subway I was crying and when the train came I ran in and I went to the first car where the motorman is . Mom followed me , she tried to do with me the happiness dance , I did n't let . I said to her Mom do n't you ever ever ever do that , with goyim do n't do that . I stopped crying and we sort of made up . She said it reminds me when I stand here and I watch how the train goes the way I would feed you when you were a baby , I would say See how the train goes into the tunnel , it goes Chew Chew Chew . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot all about the debate . Naturally . Miss Hochman called on me the second one , there was more than half the period yet . What I did was talk back and forth and this way and that way . I kept makng a mistake , instead of saying Julius Caesar was killed on the IDES of March I three times said the EYES of March . I got the lowest mark I ever got in English , C+ and Miss Hochman wrote on the comment sheet Not Well Prepared . I and Boomie had Study Period together , we got into a conversation . Boomie said I wonder when we 'll get laid . I answered him with a snap , I said what kind of when WE'LLp219get laid . I 'll get laid when I get laid and you 'll get laid when you get laid . He looked a little bit hurt so I tried sort of a joke , I said in other words I 'll go fuck myself and you 'll go fuck yourself . He said In my feelings or in my imagination I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're friends we would get laid together . I said like Marshey You WANT US to get laid together ? AllRIGHT . Why NOT . Boomie said We should send him a note that he owes for months and months Battle Aces dues . I said It 's four months . It slipped out that I remembered practically the exact time he stopped being friends . Boomie said When the term is over and we finish with finals and everything we should make a Battle Aces party . I said it should be a masquerade party and we should inviteMarshey and he should come how he really is , with a condrumon his head to show he 's a prick . In the cafeteria I and Clare had sort of an argument . She said to me I missed you yesterday in French , I said You missed me in French how come you did n't miss me in English . We later got into a conversation What does your father do and what does your father do . I said my father was sort of in the movie business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables , now he 's in pocketbooks . So I said , I could n't help it , Your father is in pocketbooks , wowee he must be a small guy . Clare said I do n't mind if you say kidding things about me . But when it comes to my father I have to say something , do n't you really think you have some nerve with a man you do n't know to make such remarks , this man gave his life practically for working class freedom , when I was a little girl once I 'll never forget he was in the hospital two weeks for being beaten up near the mastoid , I wonder if you know how serious that is , anything near the mastoid is a serious thing . I said in a very very sincere way to really excuse me as Ip220have dumb habits and she made me then promise for atoning I would definitely read it when she brought it for me , Jews Without Money and something The Coming Struggle For Power . I was almost ready to say Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to start more trouble as she had for me a terrific sandwich , it was a certain kind of goyish baloney . May 19 , 1938I had a dream . I made myself not even remember it . Somethingagain with being in the movies and sitting where I could n't see and things under the bed were pulling me down . This has to do with when I do n't cover my feet . Anyway never mind and forget it . I asked Miss Hochman if I could do an extra book report to make up for the debate mark . She was very very nice and made me feel good by saying I will be happy to read anything you wish and care to write but you need n't worry Simon , you are not among the students I worry about . C.D. brought me the books , I promised her I 'd cover them . She said her father wanted to know why she wanted them and she told him they were for a FELLAH and he would take good care of them . Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried , I know a boy you lend my books to is going to be responsible , you would n't lend them if he was n't to you a proletarian conscience , I want to know only that he has a proletarian conscience . I said I know what proletarian is but I do n't know what he means , what does he mean A ProletarianConscience . Clare said It 's if you think of what is good for workers and what workers go through , like sometimes me when I think about my father I sometimes could cry . I told her I definitely must have it then , a proletarian conscienceand it 's the same same thing with me , when I think about my father I also could cry.  |p221May  2o , 1938 Hymie told me Hohner quit yesterday . What happened was he had a fight with Mrs. Chepper and Mrs. Sandberg , he said they 're the last ones always to put out the garbage for the dumbwaiter , they said he never empties their pails right , they would always find on the bottomtheir pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the steam on full blast , the whole house had to go on the roof to cool off . In Bio Mrs. Jacobey was drawing on the blackboard some things about leaves and she told us the lines on them are called striations . Someone went Men striations , this got her very very sore and she pulled a short answer test on the whole class . I think I got ten out of ten unless she takes off for the plural of amoeba , I kept putting it down amoebas . Before I forget I and Boomie saw Lila Edlelstein go into a typing room . Boomie told me her father died , I did n't know , and she 's taking now the straight commercial course . That 's where you do n't get a language and you do n't get history and the english is business english . You write letters Dear Mr. Jones We Are Most Pleased At Your Order And Will Fill It Promptly , I saw once the book they use . That 's why I got a sad feeling and I did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0000H did I hate her guts , you remember how I hated her guts and I could n't stand her . I said You used to have a good one for her , that everything she is rhymes with itch , a bitch a snitch and a kvitch . Boomie said She was smart , one thing is she was smart but it was smart that you could n't stand , like if on a test somebody got 96 she would get 98 . Boomie then ran ahead , he had his gym . I for no reason went to the typewriter room and I looked in and I saw Lila . She was sitting in the first row first seat and she was just just starting in to type , she absolutely was doing it faster and with more concentration then anybody else . Also the teacher wasp222talking to her while she typed , definitely he said nice things . What made me sorry for her is she had sort of a big water pimple by her chin and hair was growing from it . I think that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door window , and I waved fingers and I jumped up a little she should see me . Naturally and of course when she saw me she right away stuck out her tongue . This gave me a bad mood and a little bit I took it out on Clare . She asked me So what do you think about Jews WithoutMoney , I answered her I bet it must be hard if they want to go in the subway . She would n't make up with me until I wrote in her notebook five times Simon Sloan Hereby ApologizesTo The Working Class . May 21 , 1938 I am so tired it 's a wonder I can write . In the middle of the night Dad woke us up to please help him as his end is near . Mom made him hot water and lemon and I went to the toilet with him he should throw up . Dad could n't throw up so Mom made him an enema . The enema worked , it cleaned him out and he felt better . When I saw him looking good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him and even though he smelled bad and he pushed away I kissed him . He yelled on me I should go away and get killed with the shmutshy-wutshy , if I want to shmutshy-wutshy I should shmutshy-wutshy with Jackie Cooper . I said You 're my Dad and what 's so terrible if I want to give you kisses and I kiss you to feel good . The real reason I did it I did n't tell him and never mind . All right . For two reasons I did it . Reason number one is I did n't want him to die and I should have to take a commercial course and reason numberp223two is I did n't want to have to ride that trip all the way to the cemetery to visit his grave . May 22 , 1938I did n't put down I read finally Jews Without Money and I liked it very much . My favorite part was where the kid goes on the roof and he kills all the gangsters pigeons for what the gangster did with his sister . The Coming Struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimmed through it to talk about it in a smart way . So naturally Clare in the cafeteria talked just just about The Coming Struggle For Power . She said I bet it shows you , did it show you how socialism is the only way for mankind . I said like Marshey SURE , and also how it shows that its a WAY but why necessarily is it the ONLY way . She said You should tell that , you know to who you should say its not the way , go and say its not the way to the AmericanMillions who are now under the yoke of starvation . I said UNDER the yoke of starvation is like a mixed metaphor , you made a mixed metaphor neh neh . She went neh neh back on me and she said So I did a mixed metaphor , I do n't care and I do not mind when I mix up a metaphor if I 'm doing it for the American Millions who are FEELING the yoke of starvation . She then opened the sandwiches for me , she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat salad with pepper chopped in . I started in a tease laugh and my tease laugh turned into a real laugh , it got me so I was kicking my feet and my elbows were weak . Three times I tried , the fourth time finally I could talk , I said OOOH 000H 000H and WAH WAH WAIT , The American Millions , oY oy oY The Yoke Of Starvation . What I meant was it struck me funny that she went right away from starving millions to crab meat sandwiches . Shep224took it only that I was making fun of the starving millions . That 's why she answered me You know what you are , what you are exactly is a class enemy . I said Why am I a class enemy ? I like my class and it 's the best class I was ever in . She said to me If we ever have the time , if the period comes when they say to me here 's a list of the FELLAHS who are in the way , they stand in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the list I will tell them , you know what I will say , I knew him and he was a nice person but he is a class enemy so shoot him . I was eating then a sandwich and when I looked once in her face I was so help me God afraid to look again . We then changed the subject to French and what would most likely be on the final . We even made up to study together . What I should have done was forget and drop the whole subject , I did n't though . So when the bell rang I said to her Hey you really really mean it , they would shoot me and you would say go ahead , you would let them . She made believe she did n't hear and we lined up . I was right behind her and I again said They would shoot me and you would let them , you mean it really . The thing is it began to get me and sink in , I like saw it the way I SAW it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and I wanted her to show me she was kidding . So I gave her a little tickle on the neck , absolutely nothing dirty , I did it the way you tickle a baby . Listen to what she did . She kicked back with one foot and got me good in the ankle . It hurt so much for a second I got sick to the stomach . She right away turned around and said I 'm sorry , I did n't mean it , that I did n't mean . So in the same place I tickled her again and she said I meanp225I am sorry for kicking you , for kicking you I am sorry , not for letting them shoot you . When we were walking up I felt like asking her You say you would let them shoot me , THEM . But if you had to would you do it , you yourself and you . I was afraid of the answer . I instead asked something about if it was all right with her father and if he would n't mind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power as there were parts I wanted to read over . I just now looked where she kicked me , it 's purple and I think its getting pus . May 23 , 1938I and Boomie went to get Hymie but he had to watch the bubbee . She now is almost blind from cataracts in the eyes , they have to sort of get ripe and then you take them out . The bubbee was a big nudge and would n't leave us alone . She every second pulled us by the window we should tell her what 's doing outside . We got an idea . First Boomie went to the window . He went Mammenyou bubbee , you know what you are missing , what you 're missing , Mrs. Abrams is making a peepee in the street . Hymie then ran to the window , he said Woo Gelfman is running out now , is he sore , he 's hitting her in her pussy and she 's banging on his cock . I went also to the window , I said Now they 're not fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucking Gelfman 's cock and Gelfman is licking Mrs. Abrams pussy . The bubbee cried and Hymie 's moan walked in from shopping . She said Shame on you to tease a bubbee and when I put away my packages you 'll get it good . The bubbee wanted to help her put away , Hymie 's mom would n't let . She said in Jewish All your life you worked hardp226for me Momma heart , let me work and let me do something for you . She hummed Jewish songs for the bubbee to enjoy , then she said You know what Momma shave , you 'll never guess who I met in the Sacramento dairy , I met Mrs. Roosevelt , she said her boys are crazy about a certain kind of chicken carp you do n't get in her neighborhood . It turns out she anywayhad to come see me , she and the president were talking about you , he 's all set to give you some old age money only he 's afraid for the neighbors it would n't look good , how is it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you should have under your name the two family house in Rockaway , right away the vice president would be jealous . So his idea , listen to this for an idea , you should right away put the house in my name . While they were hitting each other Hymie went to the bubbee'spocketbook , he snitched fifteen cents and we used it for candy money in the movies . We saw an old picture in the Regal , Smiling Through with Norma Shearer and Frederic March and Leslie Howard . We saw it twice for the one scene when Frederic March shoots Norma Shearer by accident , he 's aiming really for Leslie Howard . She falls in a way that you can see half the tits come out . May 24 , 1938I and Boomie and Hymie went in the water as it was very very warm . We all of us swam out past the third rope and the lifeguard whistled us to go back . I was glad , I never like to be in water over my head . Its the same thing wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things could pull me under the bed . What things I never put down exactly and never mind . After we went out we had fun with a lady . She had with her two kids and we made believe we were crazy about the kids . So she showed off for us how nice they could dig in thep227sand , she would say to them Bury mommy and then lay down and we looked up between her legs , the bush kept coming out of the bathing suit . The whole beach then started getting up and moving and yelling , we figured somebody drowned but for a while we had to stay down as we all had fantastic hardons . It turned out there was an airplane flying all around our beach from the NEws , it was really low and we could see the guy taking pictures . We got bored and we decided to walk and get frozen custardnear Sea Gate , only they have the chocolate chip . Boomie and Hymie took off their bathing suits under a towel , they have the knack so nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my underwear . This made me have a terrible mood and lousy thoughts , I had to absolutely walk away by myself and stand a second in the water . I saw again the woman from the two kids , she smiled at me and she like sat in the water in a way that I thought she was making a urination and she said to me Its such a muhchiyer . Right away I had a disgust . She was n't any more a nice bush and big tits to me , she was only shit and scumbags and I went in my throat Hitler come over , right now come over , come over kill the whole beach Hitler with me on it . The lady then talked to me again . Its just right the water , its not too hot and its not too cold , you once in a great while get it when its like this the water , when its not too hot and its not too cold , thats when its a muhchiyer . I answered her like I was a greenhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do Marshey 's mom , Dot 's ride , snot too hot snot too cold , like dis ven it iz iz bah me halso bah muhchiyer . She looked away from me and she said Maybe I sound that way , if I sound that way and that 's how I sound I 'm sorry and it 's too bad and what should I do about it because I ca n't help it . It is nothing I can help and even if I do soundp228that way , let 's say its how I sound , do you think you are doing the right thing . I do n't think its nice to make fun , a person does n't have a choice how she sounds , if they asked how I would want to sound I 'd say I want to sound like Helen Mencken . Its the same thing if they asked you here 's a choice and how would you want to look you 'd want to look like Clark Gable . I do n't make fun of you that you do n't look like Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look like Clark Gable , that 's why theres one Clark Gable , you ca n't help it if you look how you look you mutt-face you . I walked away , I did n't answer back . The mood I had I had the whole whole day and when I went to sleep it was so bad I took the covers off my feet and I did in my throat Go ahead , you want to take me , take me down . I made myself fall asleep without the covers and I had a dream with Rabbi Neuberger , he was having me write for him in Jewish and I was writing some marvelous and very deep things . In the dream I kept thinking how what I was writing was the greatest thing that was ever written , then when I got up I remembered some stuff from it and it was a bunch of shit . Except I think Hohner got mixed up in it , he was telling me Everybody gets laid , everybody is Hitler . My feet were freezing and I hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need before finals . May 25 , 1938Clare today told me her father said I could keep awhile The Coming Struggle For Power and also he sent along another book if I wanted to read it to expand and enlarge my workers horizon , I Went To Pitt College . Also she told me she liked what I said before in French . What happened was we were all reading out loud together and Mr. Wexler called on anybody to translate the word BLESSER . I had my hand half way up anyway as I had looked it up , something something told me this word he would callp229on us for . I said BLESSER is Wound , To Wound , and also I said What is interesting for this word , what makes it to me interesting is it shows how in words there are hidden things . For instance they make it the same thing here that if you are Blessed By God he also is giving you a wound or a hurt , in other words for a blessing you sort of have to get also suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my Delaney Card . Some of the kids definitely were jealous . Artie Bier afterward came over , he said God should bless you and he gave me a shot . I naturally could n't hit back as it was supposed to be a joke . So Clare was talking about it and she said to me Sometimes I love you and sometimes I hate you . I can kill you sometimes for the way you talk about Socialism . Then you say something like in French , what you said was so smart I felt like giving you a kiss in French . ' What I naturally was dying to answer was Oh you felt like giving me a French Kiss only I did n't want to get her started . She was just opening the lunch , I saw she had brownies . Before I forget Hymie was very sore as for the third time this term he got his lock clipped . He is positive Mr. Stock is doing it to get a commission for Masters locks . I told him Go get a Masters lock already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more not to get one . He said Its a definite difference , to me its a difference . I told him every teacher has a craziness , this is Stock 's craziness and to me it 's not a difference . He said God should only help Stock if he finds out and gets proof he does the clipping . I said Hymie what are you being a shmuk , you know you are a real real shmuk and he told me I 'm walking away from you not to hit you . We are starting to review in Bio and French for the finals . We had our last Assembly for the term and Dr. Gladstonemade a speech how summer is coming and it gives us theopportunity to go and discover again nature . That is what hep230used to do , he used to go out in his youth every summer and say I hear the birds and how lovely is their song , I see the grass and how green is the grass . Sheicky Liebson afterward told me his mother and Dr. Gladstone 's mother were best friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing he saw there green was his asshole . Hymie is steamed up again with his lock . He told me he found out definitely it is n't Mr. Stock who goes around clipping , it 's Mr. Foote the custodian . What happened is Hymie went down early for Tumbling Team workout and he saw Foote go around to all the lockers with clippers . Hymie is still not getting a Masters lock , he 's putting on another one from the 5 and 10 . I think he feels what I feel , he 's glad it 's a goy doing it . Clare forgot to take for me an extra sandwich and she says her father wants The Coming Struggle For Power back as he needs it for a cousin . May 27 , 1938 A good thing and a bad thing . The good thing is Miss Hochman excused me and two others from the English final , she said from all our records in the term there 's nothing we could do to get less than a 95 . Boomie passed me a note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLASS . The bad thing is Clare came very very late to the cafeteria and she said to me the first thing , Where is The Coming Struggle For Power , did you bring The Coming Struggle For Power . I gave it to her , she right away took off the cover I put on it from the Forvitz , she held it like it was a scumbag . She then took out the lunch and said to me This is the last sandwich I am bringing you . Not because of something in particular , as a FELLA I like you , if I think of you as only a FELLA I think of you as a nice FELLA , there are many nice things I would say about you . But I have to listen to myp231mother and my father , they think also you 're a nice FELLA and you ca n't help it that what you are to what they believe in is a Class Enemy . A person can be a nice FELLA and a Class Enemy . My mother says its not against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from our movement background . Also she 's getting tired of making sandwiches . I did n't even get a chance to answer back as the bell rang . I said Well okay , Good Luck on your French final . We then got on different lines . In my imagination I had an idea . How years and years from now a guy and a girl would be in the cafeteria and he would say to her all of a sudden Hey look at that , do you see that ? She would look and say Look where , I do n't see . What it would be is that where Clare and I sat , by our table , a bag would open up without hands and in the middle of the air two sandwiches would get eaten up . This is not from my original imagination . It 's from that picture , the name I do n't remember , when William Powell and Kay Francis are at the end both dead and the last scene is their ghostly spirits drink and break the two glasses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Clare waved to me and walked over , I went in my throat Love Love Love . She said You did n't give me back I Went To PITT College . I answered her Do n't worry you 'll get it you 'll get it . She said I 'm not worried , worried I am not , I wanted totell you only I want it and I need it . I did n't mean to only it came out a yell YOU 'LL GET ITYOU 'LL GET IT . Mr. Wexler noticed , he told me Fermez la bouche . May 29 , 1938 The schedule for finals was announced and I am going
