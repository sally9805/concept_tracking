THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment RLPH 1 JOHNSON BUNCHE , who was an Under-Secretary and an Under-Secretary General of the United Nations for the past sixteen years , until shortly before his death last month , was one of the greatest Americans of our clouded and mind-numbing times . Whatever part of his life we look at  --  and we have looked at quite a hit of it in recent years  --  we see what we have come to think of as profoundly , almost quintessentially American . What to us is exhilarating about the life of Ralph Bunche is the way it was so marvellously hound up in the fabric of everything we love about this country . Mr. Bunche was horn in Detroit on August 7 , 1904 . His father , Fred Bundle , was an itinerant barber . His mother , Olive Agnes Johnson Bunche , was an amateur pianist . Both his parents died in Albuquerque in 1917 ? his father of the flu , his mother of tuberculosis . After that , Mr. Bunche was raised in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , the principal of a Negro elementary school in Waco , Texas , in the eighteen-eighties , had died of malaria , leaving his wife and five children penniless in Indian territory . " My grandmother  --  I always called her Nana ' ? had ten children , but five died , and one of those who died was named Ralph , " Mr. Bunche told us in one of many conversations we were privileged to have with him in the last few years of his life . " Nana was a matriarch . She did n't take any foolishness from any-body . She had no education , but she had deep insights . She was very small but very strong , very wiry , and very outspoken . Shc looked like a white , and was often mistaken for one . Once , in Los Angeles , where we lived in a mostly white neighborhood , a salesman for cemetery plots came by and gave my grandmother a sales pitch , one of his selling points being that they did n't allow Negroes or Jews in the cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . Another time , the principal of my high school , when I was graduating , said to her , Mrs. Johnson , we 're sorry to lose Ralph . Wt'vc never thought of him as a Negro . ' My grandmother said to him , ' How dare you insult our race ? ' She always drilled into me , ' Do the best you can . Maintain your self-respect . Never let anybody detract from it . ' " When the family still lived in Detroit , Ralph Bundle 's uncles Charlie and Tom worked to support them at the Diamond Match Company . They worked there for eight years , ten and a half hours a day , at a daily wage of sixty-three cents . Then they got jobs at a hotel , as an elevator operator and a houseman , and eventually as a dance-orchestra drummer and a dress-cutter , respectively . " We all left Detroit in the summer of 1914 , just before the First World War , " Mr. Bunche told us . " My mother , my Uncle Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe train . My father , to save money , rode the rods . We went to Albuquerque , because both my mother and my Uncle Charlie had t.b . and the climate in New Mexico was supposed to he good for that . Soon after we got there , my mother took my sister , Grace , and me to the nickelodeon at the Busy Bee Theatre . She walked us down to a seat in a middle row . Right after we sat down , an usher came and asked my mother to move to the rear . M ' mother told him very quietly , ' We 're staying right here . ' And we did . After that , we went to the Busy Bee regularly , and we sat wherever we pleased . " Mr. Bunche went to high school in Los Angeles , working after school and on Saturdays as a carpet layer for a big rug-cleaning establishment . " The owner gut interested in me and offered to send me to Cal Tech or to M.I.T. to study the chemistry of dyes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , and she was against it . She said it 's important to he free . So I went , on my own , to U.C.L.A. " As a sophomore , Ralph Bundle was rejected by the R.O.T.C. , because he had a punctured eardrum  --  the result of two mastoid operations . He hitchhiked to the R.O.T.C. summer camp , in the state of Washington , anyway . We have a snapshot of him taken there . Twenty years old . Tall . Muscular . Handsome . Smiling broadly . Army fatigues . Shirtsleeves rolled up . " I did n't want to be in the R.O.T.C. , " he told us . " It was just a good way to spend the summer . They took us on cttitings . We played baseball . The camp food was good . It was a good way to keep in condition and make soave money , too . You could come out after six weeks with a hundred and sixty-five dollars . The commander was very nice to me . He let me stay , and he let me live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack home , I stowed away on the H. F. Alexander , an Admiral Lint ship going to San Francisco . They put me in the galley , shelling peas . I worked on Admiral Line ships the next two summers . I was a terrible sailor . I 'd get sick every ? time we passed the outlet of the Columbia River , But I really enjoyed getting up at five in the morning to the sound of the call boy singing : " Sleepin ' good , Sleepin ' good . Gim me dem covers , I wish you would . I know you 's tired And sleepy , too , I hates to do it But I'se got to do , For you must rise and shine For dis Admiral Line . " Then the call boy would yank the blankets off us . " ON our desk , under the snapshot of Mr. Bunche at the R.O.T.C. camp , we have assembled a frw other scraps and notes from his life . There is a lined composition hook with a faded green cardboard cover on which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy 313 Row I  --  Seat 1 ? Sec . C One of the handwritten compositions ( it was graded A ) , dated April 22 , 1925 , when he was a sophomore , is entitled " Is Man Naturally Low and Despicable ? " It is difficult for me to accept fully Hobbes ' theory of the position of man in ? society and in nature 54r . Bunche wrote I. In the first place , it seems to me that Hobbes ' conception of man as " naturally self-seeking , vile , brutish and egoistic , and nothing more " is quite a pessimistic and unwarranted one . It is true that man has these qualities in him , but I contend that these base characteristics are in part counteracted by good ones . I have a deep-set conviction that man must have an inherent notion of right and wrong ; a fundamental moral structure and a simple sense of individual obligation , whether lie be in a natural state or in society . " In my senior year at college , I had the highest grades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Bunche told us . " Dean Charles Rieber took an interest in me . Although he was stiff and formidable , his office was always open . He once said to me , ' You 're going to be a lawyer . ' Everyhody just assumed I was going to he a lawyer . If a Negro was going to be educated and a professional , he became either a doctor , a teacher , a minister , or a lawyer . I walked into Dean kieber 's office and said I had no idea what my commencement speech should be about . He handed me a book of Edna St. Vincent Mil-lay 's poems and said , ' Here . Go to the beach , and come back with a philosophical topic . ' So I went , and came back with the topic ' The Fourth Dimension of Personality ' for my commencement ad dress . " JANUARY S , S 9 7 2 In Ins commencement address , Mr Bunche said , in part : Humanity 's problem today is how to be saved from itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest , we must add a fourth dimension to this ordinary self  --  that we may expand up and out from our narrow , immediate world . This fourth dimension  --  call it " bigness , " soulfulness , spirituality , imagination , altruism , vision , or what you will  --  is that quality which gives full meaning and true reality to others . In identifying myself with my fellows and seeking to cooperate in hearty good will and understanding with them , I find my life in deed and in truth . My fellow-graduates : We are youth , and have the world yet to face . We are told that we have daring , vigor , and resourcefulness . Then let us dare to live as tore live ! Let us dedicate our vigor and our resourcefulness to the cause of human fellowship ! I commend to you the lines of Edna St. Vincent Millay : " The world stands out on either side , No wider than the heart is wide ... " " I guess I was always hardheaded and independent , " Mr. Bunche told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to do . I liked adventure , and I was willing to gamble , to take chances . When I began teaching political science at Howard University , in 1928 , Mordecai Johnson , the president of the college , once openly criticized me in a faculty meeting . ' Bundle is going all the way to Africa to find a problem , ' he said . Negro colleges are petty places . The horizon is very limited , very narrow . They can be a graveyard . They 're diseased . They know they exist as expedients , They 're not in the free , competitive market . I had to get out . I 've always had faith in the essential goodness of people . I think that basically man is good . He can he misled , but he 's good . When you believe that , there 's a lot you can do in the world . The only limitation in my job at the U.N . is that I ca n't participate in domestic partisan politics . I draw the line at endorsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a piece of pending legislation . On the other hand , I 've never had trouble speaking my mind on the race problem or poverty . At the beginning of the Montgomery , Alabama , bus movement , led by Martin Luther King , I went down there . I like to speak my mind . I've. been asked to go into politics , but to be a good politician you 've got to tolerate idiots as well as geniuses , and I 'm a little impatient with idiocy . And I could never go out and ask anybody to vote for me , and cat pizza pie and bagels and lox , and all that . I 've been asked what my main drive has been , and I think one thing : competitiveness . I have the pride of a competitor . I like to win . THE NEW YORKER think back on my school days , when I was the only Negro in the class , and I was determined to show I was as good as the white kids . In later life , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pride in the fact that I was the first Negro to be given that kind of job . And I was determined to show them . I 'm sentimental . I associate myself with whatever people I 'm working with . I like people easily . I have n't seen Noble Sissle three times in the last ten years . One morning , he calls me up to say , ' Luckey Roberts is dead . ' As soon as I heard Noble 's voice , the picture was right there for me : the gray hair , the thin face , the squint , the wrinkles under his eyes , the sort of impish smile  --  if a man in his late seventies can have an impish smile  --  the dimple in his cheek , and the warm eyes . " Almost half a century after Mr. Bunche wrote in his composition book at college that it was difficult for him to accept Hobbes ' conception of man , he gave a talk in Honolulu at the East-West Philosophers ' Conference . The title of his talk was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all of his thousands of years here , man has lived in a constant state of alienation , in his relations with nature , with his fellow-men , with younger generations , with himself , his gods , his beliefs , ideas , and values . This , however , is not at all to endorse the Hobbesian view of the natural life of man as poor , nasty , and brutish , or to say that man is innately evil or warlike and that wars arc therefore inevitable . I feel sure that man will still be here thousands of years hence . For I believe that despite so much wickedness and evil design in the world , man is essentially good . In recent years , Mr. Bunche was plagued by all kinds of physical ailments , including trouble with his legs , so that walking was very difficult for him . Stubbornly , he insisted , against his doctor 's orders , on marching with Martin Luther King in Selma , Alabama , in 1965 , and in Dr. King 's funeral procession , three years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Bunche told us . " And this was the last walk for him . Probably for me , too . It was a sad occasion , but the trip was personally gratifying to me . In Atlanta , I stayed deliberately at Pascal 's , a Negro-owned hotel , because I wanted to be with other Negroes . I wanted to he with those boys in the Mau-Mau jackets , and so on . My daughter Joan might have said that I would be jeered at . But all those boys could n't have been nicer to me . Even Stokely Carmichael was nice . " Through all the daily pressures of Mr. Bunclie 's job at the United Na tions  --  working on cables to and from the peace-keeping missions throughout the world ; conferring with the Secretary-General and other senior colleagues ; meeting ambassadors from the various missions ; attending Security Council and General Assembly meetings ; supervising the peace-keeping efforts in the Middle East ; seeing countless visitors from all over the world who wanted to talk about their problems  --  Mr. Bunche never ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Status . " I 'm in the struggle inevitably , " he said to its one day . " I 'm a member of a minority group . " He told us he . did not have any respect for what he called the self-appointed leaders of his race who were only " soapbox revolutionaries . " " I have respect for the ones who get out in the front lines and march , " he said . Part of Mr. Bunche 's own frontline work consisted of setting forth , again and again , his view that the United States needed to fight racism and poverty with the same all-out effort it made in waging any other kind of war . " Nothing is going to change the course of racial deterioration unless this country makes a massive effort to eliminate ghettos and to eliminate slums , " he told us . " There are efforts now to improve life in the ghetto , but polishing up the ghetto is not making an assault upon the ghetto itself . We need to look problems straight in the face and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict trouble , but I fear it . The troubles we 've had so far have been spontaneous and unplanned . However , nothing is more vulnerable than the modern American city . If the thirty billion dollars annually spent by this country on the war in Vietnam were channelled into an all-out effort , at all levels of our government , to mobilize the war on the ghettos , we 'd make a good start in the war on racism . " Mr. Bunche was married on June 23 , 1930 , to Ruth Ethel Harris , who was born in Montgomery , Alabama , and was then a first-grade schoolteacher in Washington . He told us one day that his children  --  Ralph , Jr. , Joan , and Jane ( who died in an accident in 1966 ) ? had been sheltered for the most part from direct experiences with racism . Joan , who is now in her early thirties and works for the United Nations Development Program , made her first trip to the Deep South about eight years ago , to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bunche gave us a copy of a letter she had written to her parents . We quote from it : DEAR MAMA AND DADDY , As I mentioned on the phone , the trip down was exceedingly pleasant . We drove in an open convertible , and I was the only Negro  --  there was a white man and a white girl . Although people occasionally looked , they never said anything , and we were served everywhere . We finally decided , after we were served in a Georgia diner on the highway which was filled with rednecks , that they probably thought that we had been on a Florida vacation , since we were all quite tanned , including my natural tan . But when we arrived in Plaquemine , the vacation was over . It is about the ugliest town I 've ever seen , except for White Castle , where I am now . I was so depressed when I got here I was ready to come home . I stayed in Plaquemine two days before I was assigned here . They put me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a local ex-madam . She was quite old and batty . and stayed in bed all day , as she has arthritis . There are no professional people in these small Negro communities , and the people are very poor  --  most of them work on the plantations , of which there are many around here . So that usually the best homes where they house the task force in the different towns are either with retired or aging madams , preachers , who are practically illiterate themselves , or maids who work for white families . This is an extremely poor community . The whites are almost as bad off as the Negroes . The population is about 1,500 , about 50% of which is Negro . There are no sewers in the entire town  --  everyone has open drainage ditches in front of their houses  --  and the gnats and mosquitoes swarm all over the place . My legs are literally bitten all over . I now do n't leave the house without rubbing mosquito repellent all over me . The Negroes here live in utter poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The houses can best be described as wooden shacks . The women have many children . We visited one home , to teach the mother how to register , and she is 32 years old , with 17 children , and the house was so tiny , I could n't imagine where she put them all . Many farm the children out to relatives and friends . The babies arc poorly clothed and badly fed , and many of the children do n't go to school at all . Our meals were horrible at first  --  pigtails , etc . I could n't eat a thing , and I have lost a lot of weight . The diet here is perfectly awful  --  the people eat almost no meat , except for pork . I really fed sorry for the children  --  they are so undernourished , and many have that disease that forms scabs on their skin , due to lack of protein . As for the whites in this town , they are perfectly horrible . They seem to all wear mean expressions on their faces  --  very tight-lipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think nothing of calling the Negroes who live here " niggers " to their faces . Of course they do n't like Alice and myself , and are rather unfriendly in the stores , since they all know who we are and what we are doing . An outsider stands out like a sore thumb in this town , since it is to very small . The police follow us around all day , and drive around our house , and our clinic . We see them so much that we are beginning to wave at them  --  there are only three police in the entire city , and they seem to patrol only the Negro areas . Our day begins by visiting the Negro homes in the area , asking them to come to a clinic that we have set up in an old abandoned wooden house . Alice and I always go together , and we often take some of the local teen-agers with us , since they know the people . Alice is a quiet Negro girl from New Orleans , who has worked with the civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is a student at a Negro college in New Orleans . Mimi Feingold , the white girl from Swarthmore , was with us for a while , but they have sent her to another small town to organize a voter registration drive there . The Negroes seem to like us very much , and everyone is extremely friendly . They all say that we are helping them gain their freedom . and so they go out of their way to drive us anywhere , and are willing to do almost anything . You learn to wave at and speak to all the Negroes on the street , no matter who they are , and they all wave back . Even the toughest Negroes treat us politely , so that I 'm not too afraid anymore working in the Negro neighborhoods , It is really amazing and inspiring to see how interested the Negroes are in learning how to register , despite their lack of education and poverty in their lives . A very poor woman of 31 here has nine children and recently suffered a heart attack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the forms . When I took her to the registrar 's office , she passed the first time  --  I was really thrilled . WHEREVER Mr. 13unche 's work took him , he made friends , and he seemed to stay in touch with everybody who had ever come into his lifr  --  from elementary school ; from U.C.L.A. ; from Harvard , where he obtained his Ph.D . in government and international relations in 1934 ; from the London School of Economics and the University of Cape Town , in South Africa , where he did additional graduate work ; from Howard University , where he was head of die Department of Political Science for many years ; from a two-year collaboration with Gunnar Myrdal in the study of the Negro in America ; from the Second World War years , when he was Senior Social Science Analyst on Africa and the Far East in the Office of the Coordinator of Information , and , later , in the Africa section of the Office of Strategic Services ; from the State Department , where he worked in many jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the conferences that worked on founding the United Nations ; and , after 1947 , from the United Nations Secretariat . " I have the heaviest personal correspondence of anybody in the place , " Mr. Bunche told us during one of our talks in his office at the U.N . His tone was one of very subdued pride almost matter-of-fact . " I get thousands of letters . I read them all . I have a lot of pen pals , too . There 's one lady , an invalid , who lives in England . She writes beautifully . I like her handwriting and the way she often starts out a letter with ' Hello , there ! ' or ' I take my pen in hand . ' I 've never met her . I once sent her some flowers on her birthday . We 've been on a first-name basis for two years at my suggestion . " Here arc a few samples of Mr. Bunche 's extraordinary correspondence . From Dr. Cecilia Irvine , one of his teachers at Jefferson High School in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and gracious to write a letter to me on the occasion of my retirement . Many times during the years I have wanted to write you to express my great admiration , not only of your achievements , but of the spirit in which you are leading your life . I would like to picture to you the boy you were . You were distinctly a thorough-bred who walked with a springy step , always you seemed completely at ease with the world and always looked up . I think , more than anything , I remember you with your head held high . remember your grandmother . I met het just once . She was dressed in black with a Queen Mary black hat , and I have never forgotten the emanation of power from that tiny figure . You were much too kind and generous to me . I always had sense enough to know that in my classes were boys and girls of ability and quality far above those possessed by myself . I consider it a great privilege to have invested my life in teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking back over the years which seem so short . Thank you for your part in making this occasion happy and may God bless you and strengthen you as you go on in the great service you are gifted to make to humanity . To Miss Gwen Phillips , editor-inchief of the 1961 Spartan , Scituate Junior-Senior High School , Scituate , Rhode Island ( 1960 ) : DEAR Miss PHILLYPS : I am happy to respond to your request for a brief comment on the theme you have chosen for the 1961 Spartan : " The Place of the Aspiring Individual in a Despairing World . " Why " despairing world " ? Are you certain of that ? I am not . It is a troubled world , to be sure , full of disturbed , possibly fearful people . But 1 do not believe that the peoples of the world are despairing , without hope , or resigned to disaster . Not at all . I think the world 's people , rather , or at least that vast majority of them who inhabit the underdeveloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in freedom and in their standard of living than ever before in human history . And I believe those aspirations will be progressively realized . We live in an exciting and dynamic world , which must go " If there 's something else you 'd rather be doing , dear , please go ahead . I doubt that Pat feels obliged to sit and watch with Dick . " forward , and I am confident will go forward despite all present dangers . From and to Sheryl Donaldson , sixth grade , Kavanaugh School , Palo Alto , California ( 1963 ) What is the single most important ideal a child must learn to practice in order to accept the responsibility of adulthood ? DEAR SHERYL : I would say that in my view integrity is the most important ideal a child must learn to practice in order to accept successfully the responsibility of adulthood . To the boys of Den 3 , Pack 35 , of the Cub Scouts of Parkesburg , Pennsylvania , in response to a request from the Den Mother of " the only colored Den in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the way to be a good American is do the best you can on everything you arc called upon to do . When you have done your best you can always feel satisfied and no one can ever justly criticize you for not having done better . Try hard and work hard , always . There is a lot of fun and satisfaction in achievement , in doing things right and doing things well . I must admit that at times , only because of my race , I have worked a little harder just to prove that race has nothing to do with ability or achievement . From and to Morton C. Haight , Fort Lauderdale , Florida ( 1968 ) : DEAR MR . BUNCHE : I am a retired member of the New Jersey Bar ( after a practice of 40 years ) , a taxpayer who is vitally concerned and interested in the welfare of this Country and its people . I am an ardent believer in equal rights and responsibilities for all of our citizens irrespective of race , color , or creed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no advantages of any kind or character can be secured by any minority groups by violence , unlawful acts and the destruction of life and property . Why would n't it be possible ( and an extremely commendable gesture ) for you and a representative group of your race ( as listed below ) to organize and by speeches , writings and other methods impress upon the illiterate and underprivileged peoples in our Country that unprovoked and spontaneous acts of violence and destruction would not accomplish their desired results and an improvement in their social welfare . DEAR MR . HAIGHT : I thank you for your letter of 5 February which I have read with much interest . Indeed , I might say that I have read it with sympathetic interest because of my impression that you are entirely sincere in what you have written . I do , of course , agree with what you have to say about the futility of violence and unlawful acts , but I do not at all agree with your assumption that speeches of any kind by anyone in our country today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a recurrence of the tragic disorders in many of our urban centres in recent years . To assume otherwise is to misjudge seriously the cause of these disorders and the temper of the Negro in the ghettos today . You see , Mr. Haight , the ghetto dweller in the American cities today ( and this is where most American Negroes are now found ) has reached a stage of frustration , despair and bitterness verging on desperation , He finds himself firmly segregated in black ghettos despite all that has been said and done about achieving equality of opportunity and citizenship for the black American , and despite the fact that there are very many white Americans , like yourself , who really believe in equal rights and opportunities for all Americans irrespective of race , color or creed . Nevertheless , the hard fact is that the ghetto dwellers have seen little or no improvement in their lots . Indeed , their existence is more segregated now than ever . In Harlem , for example , everybody , every activity , everything is black except the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the black ghetto by economic and social forces as strong as any law conies to the conclusion that he is there because he is not acceptable to or wanted by the white society outside of the ghetto . He comes to feel that outside is a hostile white society and he in turn develops a hostility toward it . In time , because of this , a vicious circle is created , and the Negro , instead of seeking escape from the ghetto , finds a haven in it because he feels safer there and not unwanted . This is the inevitable pathology and psychology of the black ghettos and this , in my view , is the basic cause of the riots . I frankly fear that unless some massive efforts are made to change radically the lot and status of the Negro in the ghetto there can be no change in his psychology or outlook and , therefore , there will be an intensification of the racial troubles which the country has so sadly suffered . In other words , I believe that the only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed
