Seizure and censorship have long been the unhappy lot of Saigon 's newspaper publishers . Now the government of South Viet Nam has assumed the power to put them out of business altogether . Last week the number of daily newspapers in the country stood at 29 , after 13 folded from failure to meet strict new financial requirements imposed by President Nguyen Van Thieu . <P> Given a six-month mandate by the National Assembly to rule by decree , Thieu announced in August that every newspaper would have to put up a $47,000 " deposit " in order to publish . From this fund would be deducted fines of up to $12,500 per infraction for " undermining national security , " an ill-defined offense that has in the past included such sins as reprinting military reports from the foreign press-even when those reports have been cleared by Vietnamese censors . Trial is before a military court , which can also impose jail sentences with no appeal . Decree 007 presented a put-up-or-shut-down dilemma for Saigon publishers , most of whom operate on a shoestring . Thieu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to kill outright at least some antigovernment papers . Looking further ahead , he wanted to use his temporary decree power to restrict leftist propaganda opportunities in the event that a cease-fire is agreed upon and lobbying begins for a coalition government . <P> Small Solace . When only a handful of publishers met Thieu 's original deadline for complying with the deposit demand , he relented slightly ; the time limit was extended two weeks and the interest rate on the enforced deposits raised from 1.5% to 12% . That was small solace to the publishers , most of whom have had to borrow the money from local banks at 24% or more . The 28-member press council that represents the nation 's newsmen and publishers resigned en masse , protesting " the heaviest penalties ever heard of in the press history of South Viet Nam . " <P> The 29 surviving dailies-17 Vietnamese , eleven Chinese and one English - have no illusions about mounting heavy attacks on Thieu . Decree 007 also declares that if two editions of any paper are seized for alleged security violations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation has been brought to trial . <P> " The first time I am seized , " says Publisher Vo Long Trieu of the opposition Dai Dan Toe , " I will stop pub ' lication . I ca n't afford to lose my deposit , and the government knows it . " The triple threat of censorship , seizure and shutdown will force editors to be more circumspect , but most take Decree 007 philosophically . " What does it matter , " asked one last week , " whether you have two or three nooses around your neck ? One is enough to hang you . "
