 | A KIND WORD ABOUT MONEY Despite its obvious evils , money represents the last , best hope of an egalitarian society @# MONEY Is THE MOST egalitarian force in society . It confers power on whoever holds it , irrespective of the source of the money or the origins of its holder . Money adds ality to desire ; money trims public demand til it fits public willingness to spend ; money provides a convenient measure with which men Ind women can determine their choices . Money has outlasted war and revolution , the dreams f utopia , and the despair of pestilence . My rivate respect for the usefulness of money , after two years in municipal government struggling with the worst money crisis in New York City 's history , has never been so great . I do - not speak of the usefulness of a specific sum of dollars with which to buy a finite supply of goods and services . I speak , rather , of the usefulness of the idea of money itself . Ordinarily , anyone who praises the usefulness of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver or perform what the owner of money demands . Frequently , the power of money is more impressive in the tangential gestures of deference which it elicits than in the goods it directly pays for . Taking for granted that money can buy for the rich caviar and chinchilla wraps , we remain fascinated that it can also bring them character , personality , and prestige , even when no coin changes hands . In fact , rumors of wealth in the face of blatant Stinginess increase the beholder 's awe faster than does simple ostentatious extravagance . Our countrymen generally expect that money influences elections , not simply through the purchase of votes for dollars ? a fading custom ? but because , as Americans tell pollsters , we believe that money commands the information media . The Congress , assuming that it is wrong for money to exert this power , has written complex and probably unenforceable laws to diminish the influence of private money on elections . This effort may not only be impractical , but misguided as well , for two major reasons . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , if you will , the need to encourage capital accumulation as public policy ? deserve fair attention in the election campaign . The consumer interests have the support of the electorate , which is made up of a far greater number of spenders than investors . Second , the fear that money will perversely defeat the majority interest in elections fails to recognize that candidates of great wealth , though clearly attractive to the propertied classes , are likely to favor even more progressive attitudes than their plainer competitors . Franklin Roosevelt , the Kennedys , Nelson Rockefeller ? all wealthy candidates from the older states ? have usually advocated programs for increasing the money supply of the poor rather than augmenting the power of the institutions of accumulated capital . The motives for this switch are very complicated . Possibly they reflect the startling speed with which the American plutocracy became an American aristocracy . The new aristocrats tend to favor the huddled poor over the striving middle class from which @#  | they themselves so lately emerged . Like landed gentry , they rally to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march of industry and commerce in which they are no longer so interested as their fathers were . On the local scene as well , in state legislatures and aldermanic chambers , the scions of wealth in America generally support consumers ? tenants , for example ? and oppose the interests of suppliers ? landlords , for example . In my post as housing administrator of New York City since January 1974 , it is not these attributes of the power of money that have won my respect . I have been astonished , rather , by its ability to reduce expectations . The fiscal crisis has already forced me to convey to my constituents the melancholy tidings that I must break , cancel , or annul housing contracts , programs , promises , commitments . My disappointed listeners understand that my words mean trouble for them , trouble ranging from the loss of money or a livelihood all the way to the destruction of the recent discovery that " the system works after all . " The point is that they accept what I have to tell them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment is the lack of money . 80 BEFORE THE FISCAL crisis , I tried of to explain to a demanding local gr in a depressed area that it was f less to build a middle-income hour development in the midst of t community because the area was ( a ) u tractive to middle-income families ; ( b ) not pable of meeting federal environmental st dards ; ( c ) too poorly served by transportation to justify new housing density whatever . once did any of these explanations convince of my visitors that I had a good reason for ing " no " to them . How marvelous , instead . see the result of saying : " Sorry , folks , v community is great , but we just have n't money with which to make the mortgage 1 you 're asking for . " In response to this sta ment , or others like it ? viz. , " You do n't ss me to run out of dough in the middle of job , do you ? " or " The city simply has to cl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents on our own notes ' . have n't heard the phrase " nonnegotiable mand " once . @#  | In order to calm down one of these protesting groups , it is not enough to assert that the money hasrun out ; convincing evidence must be presented that no other group has been offered a less stringent cutback . The more articulate and better-organized leftist leaders of community groups will deliver themselves of the view that the nation were to spend less on its military budget , money might be available . But not even from these do I hear an attack on money per se . No one , in my hearing , has suggested that money itself remains a bad thing and should be ignored . No one tells me that human needs dictate my overruling money as a means for the allocation of resources . If they are convinced that I have no money at my disposal , they accept the fact that I can not dispose of it . Since people accept both the inevitability of money and its desirability , they are stuck with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming veto on one 's power to do what may be highly desirable . ( Obviously , it will not do in abating the demand for a commodity like food , which is urgently and immediately needed . If people are hungry or cold , their appetites will not be slaked by the assertion that there is no money with which they @# might buy it ; they will , at whatever risk , help themselves and limit their consumption , not by what can be paid for , but by what they can grab and carry away . ) In the days , not so long ago , when socialism was merely a theory , people in general , and the young in particular , could theorize about a distributional system in which money would be quite unnecessary . From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs ? this was a formulation in which money would play no part . Its other difficulties were too recondite to occur to the advocates of a socialist utopia . In our time , socialism is no longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions ; lo and behold , from Bulgaria to China , the workers are paid in money . No one , I think , continues to believe that in the bureaucratic socialistic state , with its across-the-board wage rates adjudicated by an appropriate governmental body , and its administered price system , a serious attempt is made to evaluate the needs of each person or his abilities . Money , itself , is finally discovered to have an electrifying quality : it allows each person to discover for himself the order of importance of his own needs .  | 0 NE WONDERS , after all , how money got so many bad names . It has been called the quintessential capitalistic device for the enslavement of man . It is fickle , false , antispiritual , ungodly . It travels from hand to hand as a frail woman travels from man to man . Dollars poison diplomacy . Money clouds a true perception of value , which men insist on confusing with monetary price . In its purest form , as gold , it leads to desperate fallings-out between conspirators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra Madre , in the tombs of South America , amidst the fractured ribs of ancient ships sunk in the depths of the sea . It has destroyed civilizations , despoiled cultures , cheapened and debased artistic efforts . Most dramatically , of course , it is itself utterly useless . One can starve to death surrounded by it and perish of unrequited love in the midst of it . Its possessors , in every age and every culture , have a most difficult time in living the virtuous life in this world and are considered unlikely to gain entrance into the next . When people condemn money with such vehemence , they are , of course , condemning the greed that money symbolizes . This ethical coloring probably lies behind the scorn for money ; yet it does not comprise the whole of it . The singleness of purpose with which B. Traven 's adventurers pursue gold in the Sierra Madre transcends mere hoggishness ; it transcends a wish for power , because the vision of what can be bought with the treasure fades before the intensity of its pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred for it . Its apparent uselessness makes it symbolic , not merely of greed , but of waste . @# BEFORE LABELING the accumulation of money a vice , one must distinguish between two views of the economic world which men inhabit . The first , characteristically an American view , and recently set forth in highly sophisticated form by Norman Macrae , deputy editor of The Economist , in a survey of America 's third century , sees the earth as holding plenty for all . In its most vulgar form , this theory depicts economic reality as a monster buffet table groaning with pates and grapes , awaiting the arrival of the entire population ( with a few household pets and sacred cows in tow ) . None will be too late for the pate , nor will there be grapes left over to turn sour . In such a world without shortages , where every demand would be capable of instant satisfaction , money would indeed be superfluous , and any accumulation would be a sin . The moneygrubber demonstrates a lack of faith in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous invasion of the -I of others , converting what is Everyman. - common into a set of private monopolies . But in the more sophisticated versions of theory of plenty , such as Macrae 's , the tend of appetites to grow with eating , and laziness grow with satiety must be taken into acc It is possible to accept as fact the fullness of earth , and still believe that men can spoil they are not driven to exploit its potential ' and forced by some restraining mechanism make choices between what they might use slake their appetites . Money serves both t purposes . Accumulating money enables men exploit the earth 's potential riches without ping every day to pick the grapes or make pate they will need to eat ; exchanges bec possible , and through the medium of exch the earth can be persuaded to yield up wealth . Thus , even in the peaceable kingom it is not the accumulation of money which vicious , but overconsumption . To those who tend to hold an opposite of the world , the neo-Malthusian view , current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on the state of nature and its resour there will never be enough . It is in the N nature of things that men will recklessly ex ' finite resources by multiplying their number and their appetites infinitely . Neo-Malthusians also view the accumulation of money as a i but for a different reason . They are not c cerned that some may have greater shares tl others , because if it is in the nature of things that there will not be enough for all , the . survival of the species dictates that some n. have more than others . In the view of the n Malthusians , the accumulation of money is gerous because it threatens the over exploitation of natural reserves , and leads some n. the most powerful of men , to evade the nec sity of making choices . This characteristic tinguishes the very rich from all the rest of immune from having to give up one apparent . good in order to attain another , they do not derstand the more or less painful weighing alternatives which constitutes daily business the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself , since we know that choices are not usually refundable . The very poor are also immune from the need to make choices . They lack the monetary means with which to choose . It is in this respect that the pangs of poverty are painful in relation to the wealth of the surrounding society . The poor man in American society is dehumanized. not because his actual standard of living is below the level at which human life is possible ( clearly hundreds of millions of people survive on standards far lower ) . He is dehumanized because his relative poverty deprives him of the human responsibility of choice .  | Yet , faced with even the simplest choice , most of us experience some difficulty in controlling our use of money : charge accounts and credit cards , for example . Spending near-money in the form of charge accounts and credit cards is far too easy . Because the dollar bills do not leave my pocket at the time I purchase goods or a service by signing my name , I tend to evade the effort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should . @# TO REMAIN effective , money must remain ethically neutral so that we can find ourselves short of money without feeling this to be a measure of our total worth . One might , of course , develop a system of apportioning the world 's goods and services through some medium other than morally neutral money . It is conceivable that the state could reward its better citizens directly in goods and services meted out in proportion to the recipient 's worth . This suggestion has been interestingly described by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich von Hayek : " If all rewards , instead of being offered in money , were offered in the form of public distinctions or privileges , positions of power over other men , or better housing or better food , opportunities for travel or education , this would merely mean that the recipient would no longer be allowed to choose and that whoever fixed the reward determined not only its size but also the particular form in which it should be enjoyed . " Von Hayek tells us that money works precisely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it can be evaluated and , if one wishes , discounted . If I am to be paid for my services in a quantity which is less than what I think I am worth , I am , happily , able to remind myself that money measures only my price , not my value . I can remind myself of all the other value systems ? character , charm , beauty , intelligence ? which money is patently unable to measure , and in which , of course , I excel , though secretly . Money works less well in determining possession of anything which is very rare or unique . Some years ago , I heard a local community leader demand of the New York City Board of Estimate the construction of a public housing project for low-income families on Central Park West , a high-rent area . " Why ca n't poor people live on Central Park West like everybody else ? " he asked . Clearly , " everybody else " does not live on Central Park West , a two-and-a-halfmile stretch of avenue , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable density of habitation could not accommodate so much as 1 percent of the population of New York City . The speaker was , of course , saying , in a roundabout fashion , that poor people are n't paid enough money to exercise a choice in favor of living in highly desirable areas . And because our culture finds something inherently baneful about exclusion from a swath of territory , this geographical exclusion seems a particularly dramatic way to attack the monetan incapacity of the poor . On closer examination . the analogy itself should be stood on its head What is baneful about geographical exclusion is , rather , that , when motivated by prejudice or fear , it obstructs or vitiates the power of money to command choice , thereby ensuring that some people 's money is not equal to other people 's money . To urge that the land on Central Park West should be distributed without reference to price is to imply that some other basis for the distribution be established . Presto , we are in a situation where not merely the economically poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rapaciousness ( or whatever criterion for Central Park West occupancy would be adopted ) will be able to claim that they , too . should be able to live on Central Park West like " everybody else . " A unique work of art presents a similar problem . How can its monetary value be determined ? Rembrandt 's painting Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer was described as " priceless " when the Metropolitan Museum bought it for $2.3 million . While no painter in the world could produce an equivalent painting for any amount of money that might be offered him and so , therefore , no price for such a painting could be established , it nevertheless had a price . The price was simply that specific sum of money with which the trustees of the museum were willing to part in order to have the right to hang the picture on their walls and the previous owners were willing to accept in return for stripping the painting free from their wall% Two parties are necessary to establish the price of anything . This gives price its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulation ) who insist on the superiority of value over price do indeed have an important place in the world . Nevertheless , far more social damage may be done by those who do not know the price of something than by those who do not know its value . To insist on the achievement of a social value without recognizing the costs that must be incurred is to put other social values at risk . To say , as nearly everybody does , that human life is priceless , is to assert a dangerous social proposition . Surely , each life is priceless in the sense that the Rembrandt was priceless . Its equivalent can not be produced ; it is unique . However , the amount of resources that should be dedicated to keeping any single life in being imposes a hidden choice which affects at the least the availability of resources to keep other lives in being . @#  | The quality of money MONEY WILL WORK under two conditions : first , if it is parallel to other value systems and therefore compatible with a market society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of rare or unique goods or services . If it is to work as the vehicle through which people exercise choice , money must also retain certain major attributes . It must be preferable , deferable , transferable , and universally acceptable . In the classic form in which it first appeared in the modern , Western world , in the form of gold coin , it perfectly satisfied these requirements . As the rarest of the elemental metals which could be conveniently put into handling form , an object of beauty , and easily distinguishable from all other metals , gold was preferable to all other goods and services . The decision to buy something with gold meant the giving up of a great , an instinctively sensed , good . Its chemical stability , resisting oxidation and other forms of decay , made its use easily deferable : one need not exchange it quickly to avoid the effects of its inherent vices ; nor did it require feeding , like cattle , an earlier repository of exchangeable value . Gold coins could readily be transferred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were capable of considerable subdivision before their size was reduced to the point of peril . Finally , gold , being widely , but never very intensively distributed in nature , was at once familiar and acceptable everywhere , without provoking the fear that a discovery of a new major source would depreciate its value . The trouble with gold coin as the sole form of money grew as a reflex of its natural scarcity . Its phenomenal universal acceptability meant that there was n't enough of it to go round . Substitutes were developed to provide money for a vastly increasing population engaged in a vastly increased number of economic activities . First came the dilution of the purity of gold in coins , then the substitution of paper certificates which were accepted as evidence of the existence of gold coins somewhere ; ultimately , the connection between the paper and the gold coins became still more tenuous , as the face value of the paper money greatly exceeded the value of the gold coins which it purported to represent . Checks or paper orders to banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew until they became the largest part of the supply of money . Each of these changes expanded the supply of money ; each has vitiated its essential qualities . The preferability of money ? that marvelous quality that makes the swapping of cash for any specific object or service seem a diminution of one 's power of choice ? decreases as money supply increases . Fear spreads that mu ey , growing in quantity , will shrink in value . The diminution of the value of morn weakens its deferability . In the climactic day of the German inflation , money had no deft ability whatsoever ; the moment a worker receieved his wages , he hastened to spend them on the goods most readily available . By the time he reached a second store , the value of his money would be less than at the first . The obvius moral effect of this is to weaken the ability I choose . If there is no time to consider , choir is meaningless . Transferability ? the quality t enables the possessor of money to lend it I others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not choose to ? depends a on the belief that the retransfer will bring back a value equivalent to the value at the time lending . As the value of money fluctuates dog ward , lenders must compensate for the red tion by charging higher interest rates . Those who need to borrow , but whose money earn ' will not increase over the time of their lost find themselves harder pressed to pay inter on the debt they have incurred . Finally , the universal acceptability of money requires some stability between different moa systems ; if a bank in San Francisco is to am as money a check drawn on a bank in York , the San Francisco bank must have c* fidence that the New York bank will be able meet its obligations . If a shipper in one coup is to send goods to a buyer in another . e must have confidence that wild fluctuation= the exchange rate will not make the purchased too expensive or the sale ridiculously cheap . @# ALTHOUGH NONE of these qualities money seems nearly so secure as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as evidenced the willingness , however reluctant , accept as final the postponement of long-await gratifications simply on the grounds that the is no money for them . But it is not working well as it did ; interest rates keep going up : change rates are in severe fluctuation ; go r ments , forced to mitigate swings in the busing cycle , take actions to increase the supply money and diminish its value . The appa alternative is economic stagnation , but clear result of the cheapening of money is destruction of the measuring device by %%-alternative choices are evaluated , so that process of choice is cheapened to the point banality . Governments , perhaps recognizing the the posed by the constant issuance of new ma to beneficiaries selected on the basis of need making " little or no contribution to the produc- 1 @# @#  | tive process , now try to find ways to raise living standards without the use of money . Food stamps are one example , as are housing subsidies paid on behalf of tenants who do not see the money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors . It seems likely that the issuance of what amounts to single-purpose money ? food stamps , for instance ? serves a double purpose . It assures a specific group of vendors and producers , such as the agricultural and marketing interests that support food stamps , that the tax dollars their representatives voted for will be used in ways they consider important . At the same time , the limited acceptability of this near-money reassures other members of the population that the money they themselves earn by work or on investments will not be diluted by a vast outflow of dollars into the hands of a nonworking part of the population , however deserving . I am not a purist in these matters . Some years ago , as a board member of a settlement house , I was horrified to hear the social worker members attack the then proposed food stamp program as a " stigmatizing " of the poor . The food was needed ; the stamps provided a way to make it available ; and the old stigmata of poverty are no longer as shameful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which welfare recipients form unions . Yet , the social workers had a point when they opposed the food stamp program ; they were speaking correctly when they said that Congress , in the New Deal days of pioneering social legislation , insisted that , to make the poor responsible , they must be paid in money of universal acceptability . Responsibility can not be created by removing choices . Torn by a demand for increased equality of economic distribution on one side , and the fear of unwise overexpansion of the money supply on the other , government drifts into the practice of issuing special-purpose claims . There are economists who argue that inflation is not a fatal economic danger , because its effects can be balanced by transfer payments to those whose incomes fall behind the increase in prices . In my reading of the matter , however , inflation is not merely an economic problem ; at a certain rate of inflation ( who knows what ? ) , money loses its power to force men to exercise their capacity to make choices . This power must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce one 's hopes . No one knows whether , battered on the one hand by persistent changes in its own value , and on the other by the pressure to resort to money substitutes that evade choice , money can continue to function as it has in the past . Those of us who feel that life without the dignity of choice is scarcely worth living , must view the prospect with a feeling akin to despair .
