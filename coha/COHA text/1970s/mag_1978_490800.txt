THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AE have a letter from an excit- / able young woman we know : v I 've just returned from a party given to celebrate the publication of a book , edited by Linda Rosen Obst , that is called " The Sixties . " The subtitle is " The Decade Remembered Now , By the People Who Lived It Then . " I took a look at it It 's a great hook  --  especially if you only look at the pictures . My favorite picture is one with Muhammad Ali hold-Mg Ringo Starr aloft in his arms as if he  --  Muhammad Ali  --  were a butcher and Ringo Starr were a leg of mutton . The other Beatles are in the picture , too . My favorite article , by - Wavy , Gravy , is on the Woodstock music festival . It made me glad I was n't there  --  particularly since I did n't want to go . My favorite title for an article in the book is " Dylan Goes Electric . " To that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands cheered . " But here 's the thing about the party for the hook . It was held in a sort of high-toned discotHque called New York , New York . I heard many people say that this was a huge irony , because when you think of what the sixties meant and what discothCques mean you reach the conclusion that the sixties and discothques are horses of such different colors . But actually I thought that the people who gave the party ( Random House ) provided some nice sixties touches . For one thing , there was a full bar and von did n't have to pay for any of the drinks you ordered . For another , there was n't anybody to take your coat and you had to plop it down in an alcove that was reserved for coats , so there were all these coats in an alcove and if you had a particular nice and favorite coat you just had to leave it and trust that no one would take it . I thought that the leave-it-and-trust part was very sixties . For another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . In fact , they played many songs by groups from the sixties , but not many people danced to them . There were about three hundred people at the party , and I saw six people dancing to " Sympathy for the Devil . " When it was followed by " Love Is the Message , " a disco song by the MFSB Orchestra , the whole dance floor got very crowded . I also heard a group of people talking about Punk Rock and New Wave music , and they talked about it as if it were really important , but I could n't figure out if Punk Rock and New Wave were the same thing or two completely different things . Anyway , one man said he liked the energy in New Wave music , even though the politics of New Wave music was offensive . I am sure that in years to come he will write an article about New Wave music that has as stop-the-presses a title as " Dylan Goes Electric . " Later , a woman told me that all those people talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " Do you know how Mick Jagger said that he did n't want to be forty-five and singing ' Satisfaction ' ? Well , worse than that is being forty-five and writing about Mick Jagger singing ' Satisfaction . ' " I laughed . That is the only funny thing I heard anyone say at the party the whole evening . New Mayor ACRISP and cold New Year 's morning . The temperature was twenty-eight degrees , and twelve-milean-hour gusts were coming from the northeast when we arrived at City Hall Plaza for the inauguration of the onehundred-and-fifth administration of the City of New York . Mayor Edward I. Koch , of Manhattan , is carrying on a line that began in 1665 , when Thomas Willett assumed the mayoralty of the former Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam . Also to be formally sworn in that morning were City Council President Carol Bellamy , who is the first woman ever elected to citywide office , and Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin , who is the only citywide-office holdover from the 1973 elections and the one-hundred-and-fourth city administration . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the City Hall steps . Facing the platform , and surrounding it on three sides , were hundreds of wooden folding chairs aligned in rows over the breadth of what on more routine days serves as the City Hall parking lot Eventually , these chairs and a standing-room area behind them were filled by about twenty-three hundred spectators  --  the consensus approximation of several City Hall reporters we joined at a vantage point they had staked nut at the base of the westernmost column of the building 's portico . Also in place by that time were the musicians of the fortyfive-piece Seuffert Band and the singers of the All-City High School Chorus , huddled together for warmth on the easternmost reaches of the steps . A question that was debated by the reporters as they marked early arrivals among the spectators ( prominent in the first row of folding chairs was former Representative Bella Abzug , who has already announced her candidacy for the congressional seat given up by the new mayor ; and several rows farther hack was Mario Cuomo , New York 's Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November ) was how best to describe the skies overhead . " Lowering , " one reporter said . Another proposed " leaden . " " Both cliches , " said a man from the Times . " Think I 'll just stick with overcast . ' " A few minutes later , the question was settled by the new mayor himself . " A day like this , " he said in an ad-lib prologue to his prepared text , " is like the City of New York  --  gray but a little sun shining through  --  and that 's a good portent " By our watch , it was eleven-thirtyfour when the Seuffert Band struck up " N.Y.C. " ? the tune , from the musical comedy " Annie , " that Mr. Koch had adopted as his campaign song  --  and the procession of past and present municipal and state officials marched out of the City Hall entrance and onto the platform . A slight confusion about who would sit where was resolved by the new mayor  --  who , according to custom , had been sworn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform was occupied expeditiously on Mayor Koch 's left by Governor Hugh Carey ; Louis and Rose Koch , the new mayor 's parents ; Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young ; former Mayors Abraham Beame , John Lindsay , and Robert Wagner ; and City Council Majority Leader Thomas Cuite . Prominent among the officials seated to the new mayor 's right were Miss Bellamy , Mr. Goldin , Senator Patrick Moynihan , Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz , and State Comptroller Arthur Levitt . Bess Myerson , the former City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs , former Miss America , and former cochairman of Mr. Koch 's campaign , who was now serving as a kind of master of ceremonies , brought the proceedings t i order at eleven-thirty-six , only six minutes behind schedule , and then sat down at Mr. Koch 's immediate right . The speeches that soon followed were relatively brief , The Times , which often keeps such a box score , later reported that the new mayor was interrupted twice by applause , while Miss Bellamy was honored with four interruptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a termination of the city fiscal crisis : " Whatever must be done , we will do . Whatever must be ended , we will end . Whatever must he changed , we will change . Whatever must be paid , we will pay . " In retrospect , we were struck by the way the proceedings lent themselves to tripartite organization . Interspersing the three formal oaths ( administered by three different judges ) were the three customary religious representations , with the invocation delivered by Rabbi Arthur Schneier , of the Park East Synagogue ; the benediction by the Most Reverend James P. Mahoney , Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese ; and a scripture reading by the Right Reverend Paul Moore , Jr. , the Episcopal Bishop of New York . The poet John Ashhery read three works , by Marianne Moore , James Schuyler , and Paul Goodman , celebrating , respectively , the Brooklyn Bridge , Rockefeller Center , and the Hudson River . Even the demonstrators manifested themselves by threes : a small group of anti-abortion pickets wok up stations on Park Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Broadway ; and several shouters on behalf of improved wages for city employees managed to slip by the ushers on both sides but were removed , without force , after a momentary interruption of the new mayor 's speech . Then , after the ceremony ( which lasted exactly an hour , concluding with the Seuffert Band 's rendition of a selection from Handers " Water Music " ) , there were three receptions to attend inside City Hall . Council President Bellamy , in her new chambers on the first floor of the east wing , served cider and sugared pastries ; in the Council chamber overhead , Comptroller Goldin 's guests breakfasted on cheese omelettes ; and in the west-wing Blue Room the entr  --  e was hot potato-andpea soup . " My idea , " the new mayor pointed oat . We stayed on in the Blue Room long enough to enjoy the potato-andpea soup and to watch reporters attempt , without much success , to induce Mayor Koch to disclose a few of his plans . " I do n't want to spell anything out right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to pass judgment on anything that previous administrations have done . " " Is there anything you will commit yourself to doing today ? " a reporter asked . " Why , yes , " said Mayor Koch , passing up the offer of a cup of his own soup . " I 'm going to get started losing the nine pounds I 've put on since the end of the campaign . " ? THE rule in political haberdashery seems to be " Less is more , " especially when the temperature sinks below freezing . Looking down on the inauguration dais from the City Hall steps , we were able to divide the honored guests into three distinct categories . First , there were the Spartan , no-coat-no-hat people . They included Mayor Koch , elegant in a navy pinstriped suit , a white shirt , and a red silk tie ; Carol Bellamy , in a sleek black wool suit and a plum cowl-neck sweater ; John Ashhery , in gray flannel ; an unidentified photographer , in a light-blue three-piece suit and an open-necked sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Bishop Moore , who walked to the microphone wearing a dark-navy suit , a purple clerical shirt , and a round white collar . ( The Bishop moved down a notch when he put on a beige raincoat after his scripture reading . ) The second group  --  **30;5728;TOOLONG Bess Myerson , stunning in a powder-blue Ultrasuede coat and skirt ; Bishop Mahoney , in a loose black coat ; Governor Carey , former Mayor Beame , and Comptroller Goldin , all in formal , fitted dark overcoats ; Senator Moynihan , in a flowing , rumpled gray mantle ; and Deputy Mayor Herman Badillo , in black-and-gray tweed . In Cate gory Three  --  **38;5760;TOOLONG were former Mayor Lindsay ( who had appeared hatless at his own inaugurations ) and former Mayor Wagner ( who had avoided the entire issue by taking the oath of office indoors ) ; Attorney General Lefkowitz , in a jaunty gray tweed touring cap ; and Bella Ahzug , barely visible under a broad-brimmed eggplant velour . Most of the women present wore the latest in knee-high leather hoots , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most visible fur was heaver on the lapels of former Mayor Vlragner 's black overcoat . To our way of thinking , the prizes for imaginative dressing should be equally divided between Phillip Trimble , the new Counsel to the Mayor , and Henry Geldzahler , the new Cultural Affairs Commissioner . Mr. Trimble wore a battered red nylon down jacket ( which he had used on the 1976 Mount Everest expedition ) over a pepper-and-salt suit . Mr. Geldzahler wore a black pin-striped suit , an electric-blue bow tie , a white shirt , and orange-and-blue snow boots with crepe soles . ? N a quarter to two , we climbed aboard a blue city bus that had been assigned to transport the press corps to five borough receptions being held for the new mayor . Seated near the driver was Transit Authority Surface Line Dispatcher John Barbed , a pleasant gray-haired man , who explained that the vehicle was reserved for V.I.P. use . " The unique thing about this bus is that it has n't got a fare box , " he said . " Also , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture buses . Everything else is standard . " Mr. Barheri introduced us to the driver , Eugene Duffy  --  a young man with a mustache , who had been taken right from the regular holiday duty list . " No overtime unless we break down , " said Mr. Barberi . " I drive No . BD out of the East New York Depot , " said Mr. Duffy . " The route goes through Williamsburg , Bushwick , Bed-Stay , and Crown Heights . If you can handle that , you can handle anything . " " I scouted the route yesterday in my car , " said Mr. Barheri , " and I figure we 'll cover about eighty miles . " At two o'clock , with a small group of press people on board ( many of the newspaper and television reporters were driving their own cars ) , our bus hitched on to the end of a ten-car motorcade that was being shepherded by two police cars . As we headed up the F.D.R. Drive on the way to Queens , the bus fell behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we turned off the drive at Thirty-fourth Street , the entire motorcade was parked along the curb waiting for the bus to catch up . People were walking toward us along the sidewalk ; seconds later , Duffy opened the bus door to admit Mayor Koch , City Council President Bellamy , Comptroller Goldin , Deputy Mayor Badillo , Bess Myerson , and a phalanx of reporters and photographers . " I 'm very unaccustomed to limousines , " said the Mayor , sitting down at the front of the bus . " Fancy cars make me nervous . Besides , as long as I 'm in the bus it ca n't get lost . " The motorcade resumed with ten cars behind the bus . Comptroller Goldin , who had taken the scat next to the Mayor , said of the Mayor 's speech , " Ed , I really liked that phrase ' Come East , young man . ' " " That 's going to be the new slogan of this administration , " said Miss Myerson . " Who 's paying ? " asked the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queens end of the tunnel . " That would be like the city paying itself , " said Mr. Goldin . " I believe it 's called a wash , " said the Mayor . Nothing was paid by anyone . In Queens , Mr , Koch made two stops at Project Studios One , which is a work center for contemporary artists . The first was in a crowded ground-floor room that contained rows of people in wheelchairs and a red-robed choir singing " Michael , Row the Boat Ashore , " and the second was upstairs in an art gallery overflowing with community activists . " I 'm especially glad that the handicapped were not shut out , " the Maj or told the wheelchair group . " This is a unique institution a former public school , vacant ten years , that has been transformed into galleries and studios for community artists . What it stands for makes it the proper place from which to start my borough visits . " Upstairs , he said , " We are embarked on a long and extraordinary journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . To do this , I need your help and your prayers . " At the next three stops  --  the Bronx Museum of the Arts , at three-twenty ; the Public Theatre , in Manhattan , at four-twenty-five ; and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center , on Staten Island , at five-thirty  --  the agenda was roughly the same . At each one , the borough president introduced the Mayor and put in a discreet plug for more aid to his constituents . There were multiple benedictions  --  Bishop Francis T. Mugavero had given the one in Queens , and it was the Reverend Wendell Foster in the Bronx , Archbishop Torkom Manoogian in Manhattan , and Father Geoffrey R. M. Skrinar on Staten Island followed by a brief speech from the Mayor . ( Sample : " Let me tell you why I love the Bronx . I was born in the Bronx . It 's a great borough , and we 're going to bring hack that greatness that , over the years , has been permitted to , er , diminish . I make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources we have for the best uses of the people , and not for the uses of the specific interests . " ) Then Mr. Koch introduced Miss Bellamy and Mr. Goldin . ( Sample Bellamy : " If this city is to survive , it will he as a partnership . Join with me and I will join with you to make New York the paramount city it was once again . " Sample Goldin : " Government is a mixture of substance and symbolism . There is great symbolism in this room , showing how we can renew and make vital something that was sterile and cold . " ) They were succeeded by the particular deputy mayors who had political clout in the area . There were a couple of demonstrations  --  a vehement gay-rights group in front of the Public Theatre , for instance  --  hut Mr. Koch weathered verbal abuse with the cheerful aplomb that has become his trademark . " People ask me ' Are n't you frightened of the tremendous responsibility of being Mayor of New York ? ' " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want ? A hysterical mayor ? ' " As the bus left the Public Theatre , Richard Lukins , the organizer of the borough receptions , handed Mr. Koch a briefing paper for Staten Island and asked , " How do you like things so far ? " " It 's terrific ! " said the Mayor , with a grin that turned his eyes to slits . " Could we do it again ? " " In about four years , " said Mr. Lukins . Somewhat later , while the bus was crossing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on the way to Brooklyn , we asked the Mayor to sum up his feelings about his new job . " Public service , if it 's done really well , is the most exciting and rewarding profession in the world , " he said . " There is going to he a whole new housecleaning at City Hall . Not only in people but in ideas and concepts . Seth Low and Fiorello LaGuardia were the best mayors New York has ever had , and I would hope to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect criticism . If people are n't yelling and screaming at me when I start work , I 'm not doing my job . But this time next year I want people to say ' It was n't just hyperbole . He really meant it when he said he was going to change things . ' Every area in this town is contaminated by special interests , and the pressure they can apply is tremendous . I do n't want them to dominate their areas of government . I want to undominate the system . Look at my appointments. ? there 's not a clinker or a political favor in the lot . I 'm not promising miracles , but I think we can bring about a genuine improvement in the quality of city life  --  a better delivery of services and a better perception of government . Now a great many people perceive government as the enemy . But I want them to say , ' That 's us up there . That 's us . ' " The crowd waiting for the Mayor in the Auditorium Court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile . Most of its members were protesting the recent acquittal of a white policeman who had shot and killed a young black boy . When Borough President Howard Golden conducted Mr. Koch to a central platform and said , " Let 's give the Mayor a real Brooklyn welcome , " the room erupted in a frenzy of boos , cheers , shouts , and whistles . Thirty-odd demonstrators waving placards surged forward to the edge of the platform , causing uniformed policemen to stiffen and police officials in raincoats to murmur into their walkie-talkies . Mr. Koch stood his ground at the microphone and looked out at the demonstrators . " You have a mayor who can not and will not be intimidated , " he said , " and it would appear that those who have had an opportunity to make clear their grievances should now give us an opportunity to speak . " " Speak to the issue ! " called a voice from the back of the room . " I am committed to ending discrimination in this town , and for that I will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I urge you to prepare a memorandum on your demands . " A young , bearded black minister leaped onto the platform . grabbed the microphone , and asked the Mayor if he would agree to see a delegation . " I appreciate your willingness to have the matter discussed in a rational manner , " said Mr. Koch . " The Mayor 's on record that he will see a delegation ! " shouted the minister . " I suggest we take him up on this and let him make his speech . We 'll see him  --  when ? " " In the next ten days , " said Mr. Koch . " Give me a reasonable time . " " O.K. , let 's hear it for the Mayor ! " said the minister . Applause filled the room , and the political ritual continued , ending with a benediction by Rabbi Yakov Bronner . When it was over , Mr. Koch and a comet 's tail of police , reporters , politicians , and museum staff headed downstairs to cut a cake and call it a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Deputy Mayor Badillo as they walked past glass cases filled with Andean artifacts and Costa Rican pottery on their way out of the museum . " O.K. , " said Badillo . " Just make sure that somebody sets up that appointment . " " We 've agreed to meet with a responsible group and find out what the complaints are , " the Mayor said rhetorically , and in a patient tone . " Is n't that intelligent ? Is n't that reasonable ? " A detective pushed the front door open , and Mr. Koch turned to smile and wave at his entourage . " Bye-bye , " he said , and he disappeared into whirling snow . For the trip hack to Manhattan , and Gracie Mansion , he took a blue city sedan . Ninety FRANCES STELOFF , the founder of the Gotham Book Mart , has been a New York City bookseller for seventy years  --  ever since the management of Loeser 's department store , in Brooklyn , transferred her from the corset department to the gift-editions table at the time of the Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a noisy party in the Gallery , on the second floor of the G.B.M. , on West Forty-seventh Street , to celebrate both Miss Steloff 's professional anniversary and an equally remarkable personal one : on December 31st she turned ninety . ( That day , an ad appeared on the bottom of the front page of the Times " FRANCES STELOFFRapp ) 90th Birthday from the Gotham Book Mart staff . " ) The current show at the Gallery , the last pieces of which were tacked into place just minutes before the party began , is devoted to Frances Steloff , and is crammed with fascinating G.B.M. memorabilia , including the famous " We Moderns " G.B.M. catalogue of 1940 , which really established the Gotham for all time as the store with the most complete stock of twentieth-century writers ( tile catalogue is now a collector 's item and sells for as much as $12.50 ) , a Christmas , 1951 , telegram from Edith and Osbert Sitwell on a Western Union " Holiday Greeting " form , and a framed tribute to Frances Steloff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a writer or as a man without you " ) . Several hundred people crammed into the Gallery to pay tribute to Miss Steloff , who was wearing a bright-yellow silk blouse and , when we arrived , was cutting an enormous birthday cake ( yellow sponge cake with chocolate-butter-cream filling ) in the shape of an open book , made by Dumas , the fancy French bakers on the upper East Side  --  a cake so big that G.B.M. staffers had trouble getting it down to the shop , because it just about completely filled the hack seat of a taxi . Patricia Brooks , the opera singer , whose father , Jerome , was one of Frances Steloff 's fellow-clerks at Brentano 's in 1915 , was there , and so were Marian Seldes , the actress , who got down on her knees in front of Miss Steloff ( briefly , for Miss Steloff made her get right up again ) ; a carload of friends from Saratoga Springs , Miss Steloff 's home town , including Miriam Benkovitz , a recently retired professor of English literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Humane . Letters in 1967 ) ; William York Tindall , the Joyce scholar ( the James Joyce Society still holds quarterly meetings at the G.B.M. ) ; the actor Kevin McCarthy ; the author and artist Edward Gorey ; and Andreas Brown , the bibliographer and expert rare-book appraiser , who bought the Gotham from Miss Steloff ten years ago . The Gotham is itself fifty-eight years old now , and has been doing business on Forty-seventh between Fifth and Sixth for fifty-four of those years . Since 1945 , the block has become the center of the diamond business in New York . When Miss Steloff moved there  --  she has lived ever since over the shop , in an apartment with a terrace and two cats ( she goes downstairs to the shop every afternoon to run the philosophyand-relig:on department , which has a stock of several thousand books ) ? it was almost entirely a residential block : brownstones with high stoops and , on the south side of the street , little front lawns . The milkman and the iceman came by every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
