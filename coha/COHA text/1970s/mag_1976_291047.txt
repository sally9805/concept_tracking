THE CAMPAIGN/COVER STORIES <P> With no strong issues really gripping the public , with a great deal of apathy hanging over the voters , the ' 76 presidential contest has become mostly a test of personality and character . Just which man-Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter-has the temper , courage , determination and cool to lead the nation ? The answer was supposed to be forthcoming in the much-anticipated first presidential debate of 1976 . It turned out to be an underwhelming event , the debate in which the power failed and in which neither man gained a decisive edge . The situation after the 90-minute **25;7315;TOOLONG by a 27-minute audio blowout that was a testament to the fallibilities of television - was much the same as before . Carter was out front but slipping ; Ford was coming up from behind , and the election had suddenly turned into a close race . <P> Carter badly needs to be born again , this time politically . He has been off on a gaffe-a-week streak , and he can scarcely afford another week like the past two .

He has also been damaged by some disarray in his campaign organization and disputes between his Atlanta headquarters and the Democratic old pros in Washington , as well as between his local officials and his campaign chiefs in some states ( most of whom had been brought in from other states to stand above local rivalries ) . Moreover , Carter may be hurt because in a number of contests for Senator or Governor , Republicans have fielded strong candidates or Democrats have fielded weak ones . This is the case in California , Illinois , Rhode Island , Indiana and Missouri . <P> In sum , Carter is still ahead , but his base of " sure " states has been declining . On the other hand , Ford could just as easily lose his recent gains .

Each man pointedly assailed the other at times . But neither seemed eager for-and the non-debate format prevented-a direct and personal showdown . The language occasionally was tough , yet both candidates seemed wary of breaking any new ground . Perhaps having overstudied the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon debates and apparently intent on showing how knowledgeable they were , both candidates threw out briefing-book statistics in baffling profusion . But , unlike John Kennedy , they rarely marshaled the numbers to establish a more general point . The questioning from the panel of reporters concentrated heavily on taxes , budget balancing and economic policy-vital but dry topics . <P> Yet the trouble was not so much that the candidates used facts and figures , but that they used too many for quick understanding and yet not enough for really thorough exposition . Besides , they tended to talk past each other , with the arguments only rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
