Democrats are zeroing in on this situation with the argument that the administration has left itself without the tool of wage-price guidelines that its predecessors used . Rep. Henry S.

In his June 17 address Mr. Nixon spoke in general terms and promised a special " pro- ductivity commission " that would discuss critical wage and price increases after the event . He attacked wage and price controls which , he said , " would lead to rationing , black marketing , total federal bureaucratic domination .
