A PEEP INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY by Christopher Davis . 200 pages . Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> THE BOOK OF DANIEL by E.L Doctorow. 303 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> These two novels deal seriously with death in the electric chair . Inevitably they inflict a kind of emotional blackmail on the critical faculty . Legalized killing is a cruel and unusual procedure , so that the condemned , whether guilty or innocent , become miserable victims . Under such circumstances , it takes very little skill to arouse pity and terror in the reader . <P> Christopher Davis , always a painstaking craftsman ( Ishmael , Lost Summer ) , reacts to the situation by underwriting to the point of blandness . His subject is William Kemmler , an ignorant laborer who back in 1889 took a hatchet to his common-law wife when she complained of his sexual inadequacies at the wrong moment . <P> Guinea Pig . It was emphatically the wrong time for Kemmler , too . Dr. Alphonse David Rockwell was then advancing the notion that electrocution would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George Westinghouse were noisily disputing the relative merits of direct and alternating current . Kemmler was a convenient guinea pig , and so became the first man ever to be executed by that new scientific wonder , electricity . Calling his hero-victim Rupert Weber to suit his fictional purposes , Davis takes the reader through the last months of Weber 's life-his moods and his memories , fears and dreams , and particularly his effect on the prison staff that must deal with him . <P> Weber is a good character , a laconic man who is , by his lights , both skeptical and ironic . Davis plays him off chiefly against Hannibal Snow , the young prison chaplain , with whom the author is not nearly so successful . Snow is frantic in his efforts to prepare Weber 's soul to meet God and increasingly tormented by spiritual doubts of his own . In the end , the condemned man is comforting the minister . <P> It is a nice turnabout , but sympathizing with Snow 's dilemma is difficult . The jacket blurb describes him as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector . But unlike Hawthorne 's eloquent slaves to conscience , Snow is neither articulate nor even very bright , and finally he saps the novel of the considerable drama it might have had . <P> No such charge can be brought against Doctorow 's bravura effort . The Book of Daniel , transparently based on the Rosenberg case , is a bold novel that , all things considered , is surprisingly successful . Doctorow 's biggest gamble was sinking his energies into the Rosenberg case in the first place . Not that successful fiction can not spring from old newspapers , as Dostoevsky and Dreiser both demonstrated . But the Rosenberg trial was a kind of drawn-out , draining and rather grisly national ordeal . <P> Wisely , Doctorow almost completely avoids politics , concentrating on the private disaster . A 40-year-old former editor in a New York book-publishing firm , the author has no connection with the Rosenbergs or their two surviving sons . The question that obsesses him is not what the Rosenbergs did , or did not do , or the legality of their execution , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doomed family .
