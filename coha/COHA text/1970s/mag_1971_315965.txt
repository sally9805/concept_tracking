" By March , " Presidential Adviser John Ehrlichman predicted in mid-January , " all the press carping will be forgotten . The President will have announced this year 's program . He 'll have the initiative . He 'll have a forward-looking , dynamic aspect . " <P> Ehrlichman 's optimism was at least premature . In March the President 's " new American revolution " is sputtering on Capitol Hill . The Gallup poll found that , thanks to Laos , 69% of the American people think the Administration " is not telling the public all they should know " about Viet Nam . Nor is there any dramatic improvement yet in either inflation or unemployment . Issues aside , one of Richard Nixon 's most insistent problems remains the old devilment of his personal image . <P> White House aides sometimes despair that his more human qualities and his executive strengths simply do not get across to the people . Says Attorney General John Mitchell : " People do not see the President for what he really is or see what he is really doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As Nixon knows , that " misunderstanding " is liable to become more and more politically dangerous to him as 1972 approaches . <P> Equal Time . Thus , despite his deep suspicions of the news media , Nixon has embarked on what is for him an extraordinary campaign of public relations . " It 's a feeling on the President 's part , " says one White House staff member , " that the time has come to make it more personal . This is the first sustained effort to show the President 's personal side . " <P> At times recently , Nixon has been in the uncharacteristic position of actually pursuing the press himself-a minor symptom of his tendency to veer from one extreme to another . Two weeks ago , NBC 's Barbara Walters was about to embark on a vacation when she received a call from the White House inviting her to bring down a camera crew for what became a two-hour interview for the Today show . Broadcast last week , the program had Nixon chatting about his wife Pat , American family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his " stuffy " image , the President protested , a bit too much , that he never gave the matter a thought . " I do n't worry about images , " he said . " I am just going to do a good job for this country . " <P> This week Nixon scheduled an hour 's interview with ABC-TV 's Howard K. Smith . Earlier , Nixon consented to a long on-the-record talk with conservative British Journalist Peregrine Worsthorne , which resulted in some eye-opening optimism about the ultimate outcome in Indochina . Nixon even sent Worsthorne some afterthoughts about his childhood : " I developed in these formative years a strong commitment toward individual responsibility and individual dignity .
