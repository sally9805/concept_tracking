Maynihan 's Memo Fever <P> As a renegade liberal in a relatively conservative White House shop , Daniel Patrick Moynihan has never had any illusions that life would be easy . He knew he would be under skeptical scrutiny from both left and right , and so he has been . Yet his love of the provocative phrase and the unorthodox idea is so irrepressible that his numerous memos to the President are the kind of documents that inspire huzzahs of approval or howls of censure , depending upon the perspective of the reader . They also seem to have wide appeal and , unlike most private memos , actually reach millions . Lately , Moynihan 's flamboyant prose has somehow managed to leak right past the President and into the public domain . <P> The Counsellor to the President could not resist the fetching phrase " benign neglect " to describe his notion of the proper attitude the Government should now have toward race relations . Predictably enough , the document caused a sensation . Last week two more of his papers trickled out of the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugurated as President , but they nevertheless drew fire from both conservatives and liberals and kept Moynihan a foremost topic of national controversy ( TIME , March 16 ) . <P> Murderous Population . Taken as a whole , the Moynihan advice in the two memos most recently disclosed was not all that extraordinary . Yet he did manage to hint that whites might have some justification for their negative attitude toward poor blacks . " It is the existence of this lower class , " he wrote , " with its high rates of crime , dependency and general disorderliness , that causes nearby whites ( that is to say , working-class whites ; the liberals are all in the suburbs ) to fear Negroes and to seek by various ways to avoid and constrain them . " <P> He again succumbed to his weakness for the tantalizing phrase , citing the " murderous slum population " as contributing to racial tensions . That kind of talk naturally invites debate . A black activist in St. Louis dismissed Moynihan as an " ivory-tower specialist who never asked blacks about themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his authority in the academic world . " Warner S. Saunders , who works with black youths in Chicago , scoffed at Moynihan as " Nixon 's straw boss-the deputy in charge of the colored . " The New York Times contended that Moynihan 's logic is " a sophisticated rationale for racial retrogression . " The Chicago Tribune 's Walter Trohan , on the other hand , saw " constructive thought and literary merit " in the Moynihan prose . The Wall Street Journal claimed that Moynihan has offered " a fascinatingly perceptive analysis of the nation 's present condition . "
