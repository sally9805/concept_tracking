as if lines of some force were pushing against him , repellinghim . Slowly , he turned over in a somersault . Then the resistance halted him with his fingertips about six inches from the rod . He straightened his body out and moved forward a fraction of an inch . At the same time , his body began to rotate on its longitudinalaxis . He sucked in air with a loud sawing noise . Though he knew no hold existed for him , he could not help flailing his arms in panic to try to seize onto something . Now he was face " down , " or was it " up " ? Whatever the direction , it was opposite to that toward which he had been lookingwhen he had awakened . Not that this mattered . " Above " him and " below " him the view was the same . He was suspended in space , kept from falling by an invisible and unfelt cocoon . Six feet " below " him was the body of a woman with a very pale skin . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . Her eyes were closed , and her breasts rose and fell gently . Her legs were together and straight out , and her arms were by her side . She turned slowly like a chicken on a spit . The same force that was rotating her was also rotating him . He spun slowly away from her , saw other naked and hairless bodies , men , women , and children , opposite him in silent spinningrows . Above him was the rotating naked and hairless body of a Negro . He lowered his head so that he could see along his own body . He was naked and hairless , too . His skin was smooth , and the muscles of his belly were rigid , and his thighs were packed with strong young muscles . The veins that had stood out like blue mole-ridges were gone . He no longer had the body of the enfeebled and sick sixty-nine-year-old man who had been dying only a moment ago . And the hundred or so scars were gone . He realized then that there were no old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be about twenty-five years old , though it was difficult to determine thep3exact age , since the hairless heads and pubes made them seem older and younger at the same time . He had boasted that he knew no fear . Now fear ripped away the cry forming in his throat . His fear pressed down on him and squeezed the new life from him . He had been stunned at first because he was still living . Then his position in space and the arrangement of his new environmenthad frozen his senses . He was seeing and feeling through a thick semiopaque window . After a few seconds , something snapped inside him . He could almost hear it , as if a window had suddenly been raised . The world took a shape which he could grasp , though he could not comprehend it . Above him , on both sides , below him , as far as he could see , bodies floated . They were arranged in vertical and horizontal rows . The up-and-down ranks were separatedby red rods , slender as broomsticks , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other twelve inches from their heads . Each body was spaced about six feet from the body above and below and on each side . The rods came up from an abyss without bottom and soared into an abyss without ceiling . That grayness into which the rods and the bodies , up and down , right and left , disappeared was neither the sky nor the earth . There was nothing in the distance except the lackluster of infinity . On one side was a dark man with Tuscan features . On his other side was an Asiatic Indian and beyond her a large Nordic-lookingman . Not until the third revolution was he able to determine what was so odd about the man . The right arm , from a point just below the elbow , was red . It seemed to lack the outer layer of skin . A few seconds later , several rows away , he saw a male adult body lacking the skin and all the muscles of the face . There were other bodies that were not quite complete . Far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organsinside it . He continued turning and observing while his heart slammed against his chest with terror . By then he understood that he wasp4in some colossal chamber and that the metal rods were radiatingsome force that somehow supported and revolved millions  --  maybe billions  --  of human beings . Where was this place ? Certainly , it was not the city of Trieste of the Austro-HungarianEmpire of 1890 . It was like no hell or heaven of which he had ever heard or read , and he had thought that he was acquainted with every theory of the afterlife . He had died . Now he was alive . He had scoffed all his life at a life-after-death . For once , he could not deny that he had been wrong . But there was no one present to say , " I told you so , you damned infidel ! " Of all the millions , he alone was awake . As he turned at an estimated rate of one complete revolution per ten seconds , he saw something else that caused him to gasp with amazement . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , to be human . But no member of Homo sapiens had three fingers and a thumb on each hand and four toes on each foot . Nor a nose and thin black leathery lips like a dog 's . Nor a scrotum with many small knobs . Nor ears with such strange convolutions . Terror faded away . His heart quit beating so swiftly , though it did not return to normal . His brain unfroze . He must get out of this situation where he was as helpless as a hog on a turnspit . He would get to somebody who could tell him what he was doing here , how he had come here , why he was here . To decide was to act . He drew up his legs and kicked and found that the action , the reaction , rather , drove him forward a half-inch . Again , he kicked and moved against the resistance . But , as he paused , he was slowly moved back toward his original location . And his legs and arms were gently pushed toward their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving his arms in a swimmer 's breast stroke , he managed to fight toward the rod . The closer he got to it , the stronger the web of force became.  |p5He  did not give up . If he did , he would be back where he had been and without enough strength to begin fighting again . It was not his nature to give up until all his strength had been expended . He was breathing hoarsely , his body was coated with sweat , his arms and legs moved as if in a thick jelly , and his progress was imperceptible . Then , the fingertips of his left hand touched the rod . It felt warm and hard . Suddenly , he knew which way was " down . " He fell . The touch had broken the spell . The webs of air around him snapped soundlessly , and he was plunging . He was close enough to the rod to seize it with one hand . The sudden checking of his fall brought his hip up against the rod with a painful impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rod , and then his other hand clutched the rod , and he had stopped . In front of him , on the other side of the rod , the bodies had started to fall . They descended with the velocity of a falling body on Earth , and each maintained its stretched-out position and the original distance between the body above and below . They even continued to revolve . It was then that the puffs of air on his naked sweating back made him twist around on the rod . Behind him , in the vertical row of bodies that he had just occupied , the sleepers were also falling . One after the other , as if methodically dropped through a trapdoor , spinning slowly , they hurtled by him . Their heads missed him by a few inches . He was fortunate not to have been knocked off the rod and sent plunging into the abyss along with them . In stately procession , they fell . Body after body shooting down on both sides of the rod , while the other rows of millions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he began counting bodies ; he had always been a devoted enumerator . But when he had counted 3,001 , he quit . After that he gazed at the cataract of flesh . How far up , how immeasurably far up , were they stacked ? And how far down could they fall ? Unwittingly , hep6had precipitated them when his touch had disrupted the force emanating from the rod . He could not climb up the rod , but he could climb down it . He began to let himself down , and then he looked upward and he forgot about the bodies hurtling by him . Somewhere overhead , a humming was overriding the whooshing sound of the falling bodies . A narrow craft , of some bright green substance and shaped like a canoe , was sinking between the column of the fallers and the neighboring column of suspended . The aerial canoe had no visible means of support , he thought , and it was a measure of his terror that he did not even think about his pun . No visible means of support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Nights . A face appeared over the edge of the vessel . The craft stopped , and the humming noise ceased . Another face was by the first . Both had long , dark and straight hair . Presently , the faces withdrew , the humming was renewed , and the canoe again descended toward him . When it was about five feet above him , it halted . There was a single small symbol on the green bow : a white spiral that exploded to the right . One of the canoe 's occupantsspoke in a language with many vowels and a distinct and frequently recurring glottal stop . It sounded like Polynesian . Abruptly , the invisible cocoon around him reasserted itself . The falling bodies began to slow in their rate of descent and then stopped . The man on the rod felt the retaining force close in on him and lift him , up . Though he clung desperately to the rod , his legs were moved up and then away and his body followedit . Soon he was looking downward . His hands were torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on sanity , on the world , had also been torn away . He began to drift upward and to revolve . He went by the aerial canoe and rose above it . The two men in the canoe were naked , dark-skinned as Yemenite Arabs , and handsome . Their features were Nordic , resembling those of some Icelanders he had known . One of them lifted a hand which held a pencil-sized metalp7object . The man sighted along it as if he were going to shoot something from it . The man floating in the air shouted with rage and hate and frustration and flailed his arms to swim toward the machine . " I 'll kill ! " he screamed . " Kill ! Kill ! " Oblivion came again . God was standing over him as he lay on the grass by the waters and the weeping willows . He lay wide-eyed and as weak as a baby just born . God was poking him in the ribs with the end of an iron cane . God was a tall man of middle age . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing the Sunday best of an English gentleman of the 53rd year of Queen Victoria 's reign . " You 're late , " God said . " Long past due for the payment of your debt , you know . " " What debt ? " Richard Francis Burton said . He passed his fingertips over his ribs to make sure that all were still there . " You owe for the flesh , " replied God , poking him again with the cane . " Not to mention the spirit . You owe for the flesh and the spirit , which are one and the same thing . " Burton struggled to get up onto his feet . Nobody , not even God , was going to punch Richard Burton in the ribs and get away without a battle . God , ignoring the futile efforts , pulled a large gold watch from His vest pocket , unsnapped its heavy enscrolled gold lid , looked at the hands , and said , " Long past due . " God held out His other hand , its palm turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be forced to foreclose . "  | " Foreclose on what ? " Darkness fell . God began to dissolve into the darkness . It was then that Burton saw that God resembled himself . He had the same black straight hair , the same Arabic face with the dark stabbing eyes , high cheekbones , heavy lips , and the thrust-out , deeply cleft chin . The same long deep scars , witnesses of the Somali javelin which pierced his jaws in that fight at Berbera , were on His cheeks . His hands and feet were small , contrasting with His broad shoulders and massive chest . And He had the long thick moustachios and the long forked beard that had caused the Bedouin to name Burton " the Father of Mous-tachios . " " You look like the Devil , " Burton said , but God had become just another shadow in the darkness . Burton was still sleeping , but he was so close to the surface of consciousness that he was aware that he had been dreaming . Light was replacing the night . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was . A blue sky was above . A gentle breeze flowed over his naked body . His hairless head and his back and legs and the palms of his hands were against grass . He turned his head to the right and saw a plain covered with very short , very green , very thick grass . The plain sloped gently upward for a mile . Beyond the plain was a range of hills that started out mildly , then became steeper and higher and very irregular in shape as they climbed toward the mountains . The hills seemed to run for about two and a half miles . All were covered with trees , some of which blazed with scarlets , azures , bright greens , flaming yellows , andp9deep pinks . The mountains beyond the hills rose suddenly , perpendicularly , and unbelievably high . They were black and bluish-green , looking like a glassy igneous rock with huge splotches of lichen covering at least a quarter of the surface . Between him and the hills were many human bodies . The closest one , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had been below him in that vertical row . He wanted to rise up , but he was sluggish and numb . All he could do for the moment , and that required a strong effort , was to turn his head to the left . There were more naked bodies there on a plain that sloped down to a river perhaps 100 yards away . The river was about a mile wide , and on its other side was another plain , probably about a mile broad and slopingupward to foothills covered with more of the trees and then the towering precipitous black and bluish-green mountains . That was the east , he thought frozenly . The sun had just risen over the top of the mountain there . Almost by the river 's edge was a strange structure . It was a gray red-flecked granite and was shaped like a mushroom . Its broad base could not be more than five feet high , and the mushroom top had a diameter of about fifty feet . He managed to rise far enough to support himself on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . Everywhere on the plain were unclothed bald-headed human beings , spaced about six feet apart . Most were still on their backs and gazing into the sky . Others were beginning to stir , to look around , or even sitting up . He sat up also and felt his head and face with both hands . They were smooth . His body was not that wrinkled , ridged , bumpy , withered body of the sixty-nine-year-old which had lain on his deathbed . It was the smooth-skinned and powerfully muscled body he had when he was twenty-five years old . The same body he had when he was floating between those rods in that dream . Dream ? It had seemed too vivid to be a dream . It was not a dream.  |p10Around  his wrist was a thin band of transparent material . It was connected to a six-inch-long strap of the same material . The other end was clenched about a metallic arc , the handle of a grayish metal cylinder with a closed cover . Idly , not concentrating because his mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a pound , so it could not be of iron even if it was hollow . Its diameter was a foot and a half and it was over two and a half feet tall . Everyone had a similar object strapped to his wrist . Unsteadily , his heart beginning to pick up speed as his senses became unnumbed , he got to his feet . Others were rising , too . Many had faces which were slack or congealed with an icy wonder . Some looked fearful . Their eyes were wide and rolling ; their chests rose and fell swiftly ; their breaths hissed out . Some were shaking as if an icy wind had swept over them , though the air was pleasantly warm . The strange thing , the really alien and frightening , thing , was the almost complete silence . Nobody said a word ; there was only the hissing of breaths of those near him , a tiny slap as a man smacked himself on his leg ; a low whistling from a woman . Their mouths hung open , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , looking into each other 's faces , sometimes reaching out to lightly touch another . They shuffledli their bare feet , turned this way , turned back the other way , gazed at the hills , the trees covered with the huge vividly coloredblooms , the lichenous and soaring mountains , the sparklingand green river , the mushroom-shaped stones , the straps and the gray metallic containers . Some felt their naked skulls and their faces . Everybody was encased in a mindless motion and in silence . Suddenly , a woman began moaning . She sank to her knees , threw her head and her shoulders back , and she howled . At thesame time , far down the riverbank , somebody else howled . It was as if these two cries were signals . Or as if the two weredouble keys to the human voice and had unlocked it.  |p11The  men and women and children began screaming or sobbingor tearing at their faces with their nails or beating themselves on their breasts or falling on their knees and lifting their hands in prayer or throwing themselves down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostrich-like , to avoid being seen , or rolling back and forth , barking like dogs or howling like wolves . The terror and the hysteria gripped Burton . He wanted to go to his knees and pray for salvation from judgment . He wanted mercy . He did not want to see the blinding face of God appear over the mountains , a face brighter than the sun . He was not as brave and as guiltless as he had thought . Judgment would be so terrifying , so utterly final , that he could not bear to think about it . Once , he had had a fantasy about standing before God after he had died . He had been little and naked and in the middle of a vast plain , like this , but he had been all alone . Then God , great as a mountain , had strode toward him . And he , Burton , had stood his ground and defied God . There was no God here , but he fled anyway . He ran across the plain , pushing men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping over others as they rolled on the ground . As he ran , he howled , " No ! No ! No ! " His arms windmilled to fend off unseen terrors . The cylinder strapped to his wrist whirled around and around . When he was panting so that he could no longer howl , and his legs and arms were hung with weights , and his lungs burned , and his heart boomed , he threw himself down under the first of the trees . After a while , he sat up and faced towards the plain . The mob noise had changed from screams and howls to a gigantic chattering . The majority were talking to each other , though it did not seem that anybody was listening . Burton could not hear any of the individual words . Some men and women were embracingand kissing as if they had been acquainted in their previouslives and now were holding each other to reassure each other of their identities and of their reality.  |p12There  were a number of children in the great crowd . Not one was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heads were hairless . Half of them were weeping , rooted to one spot . Others , also crying out , were running back and forth , looking into the faces above them , obviously seeking their parents . He was beginning to breathe more easily . He stood up and turned around . The tree under which he was standing was a red pine ( sometimes wrongly called a Norway pine ) about two hundred feet tall . Beside it was a tree of a type he had never seen . He doubted that it had existed on Earth . ( He was sure that he was not on Earth , though he could not have given any specific reasons at that moment . ) It had a thick , gnarled blackish trunk and many thick branches bearing triangular sixfeet-longleaves , green with scarlet lacings . It was about three hundred feet high . There were also trees that looked like white and black oaks , firs , Western yew , and lodgepole pine . Here and there were clumps of tall bamboo-like plants , and everywhere that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet high . There were no animals in sight . No insectsand no birds . He looked around for a stick or a club . He did not have the slightest idea what was on the agenda for humanity , but if it was left unsupervised or uncontrolled , it would soon be revertingto its normal state . Once the shock was over , the people would be looking out for themselves , and that meant that some would be bullying others . He found nothing useful as a weapon . Then it occurred to him that the metal cylinder could be used as a weapon . He banged it against a tree . Though it had little weight , it was extremelyhard . He raised the lid , which was hinged inside at one end . The hollow interior had six snapdown rings of metal , three on each side and spaced so that each could hold a deep cup or dish or rectangular container of gray metal . All the containers were empty . He closed the lid . Doubtless he would find out in time what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection had not resulted in bodies of fragile misty ectoplasm . He was all bone and blood and flesh . Though he still felt somewhat detached from reality , as if he had been disengaged from the gears of the world , he was emerging from his shock . He was thirsty . He would have to go down and drink from the river and hope that it would not be poisoned . At this thought , he grinned wryly , and stroked his upper lip . His finger felt disappointed . That was a curious reaction , he thought , and then he remembered that his thick moustache was gone . Oh , yes , he had hoped that the riverwater would not be poisoned . What a strange thought ! Why should the dead be brought back to life only to be killed again ? But he stood for a long while under the tree . He hated to go back through that madly talking , hysterically sobbing crowd to reach the river . Here , away from the mob , he was free from much of the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea . If he ventured back , he would be caught up in their emotions again . Presently , he saw a figure detach itself from the naked throng and walk toward him . He saw that it was not human . It was then that Burton was sure that this Resurrection Day was not the one which any religion had stated would occur . Burton had not believed in the God portrayed by the Christians , Moslems , Hindus , or any faith . In fact , he was not sure that he believed in any Creator whatsoever . He had believed in Richard Francis Burton and a few friends . He was sure that when he died , the world would cease to exist.  |p14Waking  up after death , in this valley by this river , he had been powerless to defend himself against the doubts that existed in every man exposed to an early religious conditioning and to an adult society which preached its convictions at every chance . Now , seeing the alien approach , he was sure that there was some other explanation for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a scientific , reason for his being here ; he did not have to resort to Judeo-Christian-Moslem myths for cause . The creature , it , he  --  it undoubtedly was a male  --  was a biped about six feet eight inches tall . The pink-skinned body was very thin ; there were three fingers and a thumb on each hand and four very long and thin toes on each foot . There were two dark red spots below the male nipples on the chest . The face was semihuman . Thick black eyebrows swept down to the protrudingcheekbones and flared out to cover them with a brownish down . The sides of his nostrils were fringed with a thin membraneabout a sixteenth of an inch long . The thick pad of cartilageon the end of his nose was deeply cleft . The lips were thin , leathery , and black . The ears were lobeless and the convolutionswithin were nonhuman . His scrotum looked as if it contained many small testes . He had seen this creature floating in the ranks a few rows away in that nightmare place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and revealed quite human teeth . He said , " I hope you speak English . How/ever , I can speak with some fluency in Russian , Mandarin Chinese , or Hindustani . " Burton felt a slight shock , as if a dog or an ape had spoken to him . " You speak Midwestern American English , " he replied . " Quite well , too . Although too precisely . " " Thank you , " the creature said . " I followed you because you seemed the only person with enough sense to get away from that chaos . Perhaps you have some explanation for this .. . what do you call it ? . . . resurrection ? " " No more than you , " Burton said . " In fact , I do n't have any explanation for your existence , before or after resurrection . " The thick eyebrows of the alien twitched , a gesture which Burton was to find indicated surprise or puzzlement . " No ? That is strange . I would have sworn that not one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seen me on TV . " " TV ? " The creature 's brows twitched again . " You do n't know what TV . .. " His voice trailed , then he smiled again . " Of course , how stupid of me ! You must have died before I came to Earth ! " " When was that ? " The alien 's eyebrows rose ( equivalent to a human frown as Burton would find ) , and he said slowly , " Let 's see . I believe it was , in your chronology , 2002 A.D. When did you die ? " " It must have been in 1890 A.D. , " Burton said . The creature had brought back his sense that all this was not real . He ran his tongue around his mouth ; the back teeth he had lost when the Somali spear ran through his cheeks were now replaced . But he was still circumcised , and the men on the riverbank  --  most of whom had been crying out in the Austrian-German , Italian , or the Slovenian of Trieste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the males in that area would have been uncircumcised.  | " At least , " Burton added , " I remember nothing after October20 , 1890 . " " Aab ! " the creature said . " So , I left my native planet approximately200 years before you died . My planet ? It was a satellite of that star you Terrestrials call Tau Ceti . We placed ourselves in suspended animation , and , when our ship approachedyour sun , we were automatically thawed out , and . . . but you do not know what I am talking about ? " " Not quite . Things are happening too fast . I would like to get details later . What is your name ? " " Monat Grrautut . Yours ? " " Richard Francis Burton at your service . " He bowed slightly and smiled . Despite the strangeness of the creature and some repulsive physical aspects , Burton found himself warming to him . " The late Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton , " he added . " Most recently Her Majesty 's Consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I lived in the nineteenth century , not the sixteenth . " " A Queen Elizabeth reigned over Great Britain in the twentiethcentury , " Monat said . He turned to look toward the riverbank . " Why are they so afraid ? All the human beings I met were either sure that there would be no afterlife or else that they would get preferential treatment in the hereafter . " Burton grinned and said , " Those who denied the hereafter are sure they 're in Hell because they denied it . Those who knew they would go to Heaven our afterlivesshowed those in Hell as naked and those in Heaven as being clothed . So , if you 're resurrected bare-ass naked , you must be in Hell . " " You seem amused , " Monat said . " I was n't so amused a few minutes ago , " Burton said . " And I 'm shaken . Very shaken . But seeing you here makes me think that things are not what people thought they would be . Theyp17seldom are . And God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem to be in a hurry about it . I think there 's an explanation for this , but it wo n't match any of the conjectures I knew on Earth . " " I doubt we 're on Earth , " Monat said . He pointed upward with long slim fingers which bore thick cartilage pads instead of nails . He said , " If you look steadily there , with your eyes shielded , you can see another celestial body near the sun . It is not the moon . " Burton cupped his hands over his eyes , the metal cylinder on his shoulder , and stared at the point indicated . He saw a faintly glowing body which seemed to be an eighth of the size of a full moon . When he put his hands down , he said , " A star ? " Monat said , " I believe so . I thought I saw several other very faint bodies elsewhere in the sky , but I 'm not sure . We will know when night comes . " " Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Monat gestured at the sun . " It is rising and so it will descend , and then night should come . I think that it would be best to prepare for the night . And for other events . It is warm and getting warmer , but the night may be cold and it might rain . We should build a shelter of some sort . And we should also think about finding food . Though I imagine that this device "  --  he indicated the cylinder  --  " will feed us . " Burton said , " What makes you think that ? " " I looked inside mine . It contains dishes and cups , all empty now , but obviously made to be filled . " Burton felt less unreal . The being  --  the Tau Cetan !  --  talked so pragmatically , so sensibly , that he provided an anchor to which Burton could tie his senses before they drifted away again . And , despite the repulsive alienness of the creature , he exuded a friendliness and an openness that warmed Burton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spanp18many trillions of miles of interstellar space must have very valuableknowledge and resources . Others were beginning to separate themselves from the crowd . A group of about ten men and women walked slowly toward him . Some were talking , but others were silent and wide-eyed . They did not seem to have a definite goal in mind ; they just floated along like a cloud driven by a wind . When they got near Burton and Monat , they stopped walking . A man trailing the group especially attracted Burton 's scrutiny . Monat was obviously nonhuman but this fellow was subhumanor prehuman . He stood about five feet tall . He was squat and powerfully muscled . His head was thrust forward on a bowed and very thick neck . The forehead was low and slanting . The skull was long and narrow . Enormous supraorbital ridges shadowed dark brown eyes . The nose was a smear of flesh with arching nostrils , and the bulging bones of his jaws pushed his thin lips out . He may have been covered with as much hair as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , he was stripped of hair . The huge hands looked as if they could squeeze water from a stone . He kept looking behind him as if he feared that someone was sneaking up on him . The human beings moved away from him when he approached them . But then another man walked up to him and said something to the subhuman in English . It was evident that the man did not expect to be understood but that he was trying to be friendly . His voice , however , was almost hoarse . The newcomer was a muscular youth about six feet tall . He had a face that looked handsome when he faced Burton but was comically craggy in profile . His eyes were green . The subhuman jumped a little when he was addressed . He peered at the grinning youth from under the bars of bone . Then he smiled , revealing large thick teeth , and spoke in a language Burton did not recognize . He pointed to himself and said something that sounded like Kazzintuitruaabemss . Later , Burtonp19would find out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others consisted of five men and four women . Two of the men had known each other in Earthlife , and one of them had been married to one of the women . All were Italians or Slovenes who had died in Trieste , apparently about 1890 , though he knew none of them . " You there , " Burton said , pointing to the man who had spokenin English . " Step forward . What is your name ? " The man approached him hesitantly . He said , " You 're English , right ? " The man spoke with an American Midwest flatness . Burton held out his hand and said , " Yaas . Burton here . " The fellow raised hairless eyebrows and said , " Burton ? " He leaned forward and peered at Burton 's face . " It 's hard to say .. . it could n't be ... " He straightened up . " Name 's Peter Frigate . F-R-I-G-A-T-E . " He looked around him and then said in a voice even more strained , " It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , you know . I feel as if I 'm coming apart . But ... here we are . . . alive again . . . young again . . . no hellfire . . . not yet , anyway . Born in 1918 , died 2008. . . becauseof what this extra-Terrestrial did . . . do n't hold it against him ... only defending himself , you know . " Frigate 's voice died away to a whisper . He grinned nervously at Monat . Burton said , " You know this . . . Monat Grrautut ? " " Not exactly , " Frigate said . " I saw enough of him on TV , of course , and heard enough and read enough about him . " He held out his hand as if he expected it to be rejected . Monat smiled , and they shook hands . Frigate said , " I think it 'd be a good idea if we banded together . We may need protection . " " Why ? " Burton said , though he knew well enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Once people get used to being resurrected , they 'll be fightingp20for women and food and anything that takes their fancy . And I think we ought to be buddies with this Neanderthal or whatever he is . Anyway , he 'll be a good man in a fight . " Kazz , as he was named later on , seemed pathetically eager to be accepted . At the same time , he was suspicious of anyone who got too close . A woman walked by then , muttering over and over in German , " My God ! What have I done to offend Thee ? " A man , both fists clenched and raised to shoulder height , was shouting in Yiddish , " My beard ! My beard ! " Another man was pointing at his genitals and saying in Slovenian , " They 've made a Jew of me ! A Jew ! Do you think that . . . ? No , it could n't be ! " Burton grinned savagely and said , " It does n't occur to Wm that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian aborigine or an ancient Egyptian , all of whom practicedcircumcision . " " What did he say ? " asked Frigate . Burton translated ; Frigate laughed . A woman hurried by ; she was making a pathetic attempt to cover her breasts and her pubic regions with her hands . She was muttering , " What will they think , what will they think ? " And she disappeared behind the trees . A man and a woman passed them ; they were talking loudly in Italian as if they were separated by a broad highway . " We ca n't be in Heaven . . . I know , oh my God , I know ! . . . There was Giuseppe Zomzini and you know what a wicked man he was . . . he ought to bum in hellfire ! I know , I know ... he stole from the treasury , he frequented whorehouses , he drank himself to death . . . yet . . . he 's here ! . . . I know , I know . . . " Another woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy ! Where are you ? It 's your own darling Hilda ! " A man scowled at them and said repeatedly , in Hungarian , " I 'm as good as anyone and better than some . To hell with them . "  |p21A  woman said , " I wasted my whole life , my whole life . I did everything for them , and now . . . " A man , swinging the metal cylinder before him as if it were a censer , called out , " Follow me to the mountains ! Follow me ! I know the truth , good people ! Follow me ! We 'll be safe in the bosom of the Lord ! Do n't believe this illusion around you ; follow me ! I 'll open your eyes ! " Others spoke gibberish or were silent , their lips tight as if they feared to utter what was within them . " It 'll take some time before they straighten out , " Burton said . He felt that it would take a long time before the world becamemundane for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frigate said . " What do you mean ? " " They did n't know the Truth  --  capital T  --  on Earth , so why should they here ? What makes you think we 're going to get a revelation ? " Burton shrugged and said , " I do n't . But I do think we ought to determine just what our environment is and how we can survivein it . The fortune of a man who sits , sits also . " He pointed toward the riverbank . " See those stone mushrooms ? They seem to be spaced out at intervals of a mile . I wonder what their purpose is ? " Monat said , " If you had taken a close look at that one , you would have seen that its surface contains about 700 round indentations . These are just the right size for the base of a cylinderto fit in . In fact , there is a cylinder in the center of the top surface . I think that if we examine that cylinder , we may be able to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'd do just that . "  |p22A  woman approached them . She was of medium height , had a superb shape , and a face that would have been beautiful if it had been framed by hair . Her eyes were large and dark . She made no attempt to cover herself with her hands . Burton was not the least bit aroused looking at her or any of the women . He was too deeply numbed . The woman spoke in a well-modulated voice and an Oxford accent . " I beg your pardon , gentlemen . I could n't help overhearingyou . You 're the only English voices I 've heard since I woke up . . . here , wherever here is . I am an Englishwoman , and I am looking for protection . I throw myself on your mercy . " " Fortunately for you , madame , " Burton said , " you come to the right men . At least , speaking for myself , I can assure you that you will get all the protection I can afford . Though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known , you might not have fared so well . By the way , this gentleman is not English . He 's Yankee . " It seemed strange to be speaking so formally this day of all days , with all the wailing and shouting up and down the valley and everybody birth-naked and as hairless as eels . The woman held out her hand to Burton . " I 'm Mrs. Hargreaves , " she said . Burton took the hand , and , bowing , kissed it lightly . He felt foolish , but , at the same time , the gesture strengthened his hold on sanity . If the forms of polite society could be preserved , perhaps the " rightness " of things might also be restored . " The late Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton , " he said , grin/ning slightly at the late . " Perhaps you 've heard of me ? " She snatched her hand away and then extended it again . " Yes , I 've heard of you , Sir Richard . " Somebody said , " It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken in such a low tone . " And why not ? " he said . " Richard Burton ! " Frigate said . " Yes . I wondered , but without any hair ? ... " " Yaas ? " Burton drawled . " Yaas ! " Frigate said . " Just as the books said ! " " What are you talking about ? " Frigate breathed in deeply and then said , " Never mind now , Mr. Burton . I 'll explain later . Just take it that I 'm very shaken up . Not in my right mind . You understand that , of course . " He looked intently at Mrs. Hargreaves , shook his head , and said , " Is your name Alice ? " " Why , yes ! " she said , smiling and becoming beautiful , hair or no hair . " How did you know ? Have I met you ? No , I do n't think so . " " Alice Pleasance Liddell Hargreaves ? " " Yes ! " " I have to go sit down , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down with his back to the trunk . His eyes looked a little glazed . " Aftershock , " Burton said . He could expect such erratic behavior and speech from the others for some time . He could expect a certain amount of nonrational behavior from himself , too . The important thing was to get shelter and food and some plan for common defense . Burton spoke in Italian and Slovenian to the others and then made the introductions . They did not protest when he suggested that they should follow him down to the river 's edge . " I 'm sure we 're all thirsty , " he said . " And we should investigatethat stone mushroom . " They walked back to the plain behind them . The people were sitting on the grass or milling about . They passed one cou/ple arguing loudly and red-facedly . Apparently , they had been husband and wife and were continuing a life-long dispute . Suddenly , the man turned and walked away . The wife looked unbelievinglyat him and then ran after him . He thrust her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He quickly lost himself in the crowd , but the woman wandered around , calling his name and threatening to make a scandal if he did not come out of hiding . Burton thought briefly of his own wife , Isabel . He had not seen her in this crowd , though that did not mean that she was not in it . But she would have been looking for him . She would not stop until she found him . He pushed through the crowd to the river 's edge and then got down on his knees and scooped up water with his hands . It was cool and clear and refreshing . His stomach felt as if it were absolutelyempty . After he had satisfied his thirst , he became hungry . " The waters of the River of Life , " Burton said . " The Styx ? Lethe ? No , not Lethe . I remember everything about my Earthly existence . " " I wish I could forget mine , " Frigate said . Alice Hargreaves was kneeling by the edge and dipping water with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure was certainly lovely , Burton thought . He wondered if she would be blonde when her hair grew out , if it grew out . Perhaps Whoever had put them here intended they should all be bald , forever , for some reason of Theirs . They climbed upon the top of the nearest mushroom structure . The granite was a dense-grained gray flecked heavily with red . On its flat surface were seven hundred indentations , formingfifty concentric circles . The depression in the center held a metal cylinder . A little dark-skinned man with a big nose and receding chin was examining the cylinder . As they approached , he looked up and smiled . " This one wo n't open , " he said in German . " Perhaps it will later . I 'm sure it 's there as an example of what to do with our own containers . "  |p25He  introduced himself as Lev Ruach and switched to a heavilyaccented English when Burton , Frigate , and Hargreaves gave their names . " I was an atheist , " he said , seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know ! This place is as big a shock to an atheist , you know , as to those devout believers who had pictured an afterlife quite different from this . Well , so I was wrong . It would n't be the first time . " He chuckled , and said to Monat , " I recognized you at once . It 's a good thing for you that you were resurrected in a group mainly consisting of people who died in the nineteenth century . Otherwise , you 'd be lynched . " " Why is that ? " Burton asked . " He killed Earth , " Frigate said . " At least , I think he did . " " The scanner , " Monat said dolefully , " was adjusted to kill only human beings . And it would not have exterminated all of mankind . It would have ceased operating after a predetermined number  --  unfortunately , a large number  --  had lost their lives . Believe me , my friends , I did not want to do that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the decision to press the button . But I had to protect my people . You forced my hand . " " It started when Monat was on a live show , " Frigate said . " Monat made an unfortunate remark . He said that his scientists had the knowledge and ability to keep people from getting old . Theoretically , using Tau Cetan techniques , a man could live forever . But the knowledge was not used on his planet ; it was forbidden . The interviewer asked him if these techniques could be applied to Terrestrials . Monat replied that there was no reason why not . But rejuvenation was denied to his own kind for a very good reason , and this also applied to Terrestrials . By then , the government censor realized what was happening and cut off the audio . But it was too late . " " Later , " Lev Ruach said , " the American government reportedthat Monat had misunderstood the question , that his knowledge of English had led him to make a misstatement . Butp26it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demanded that Monat reveal the secret of eternal youth . " " Which I did not have , " said Monat . " Not a single one of our expedition had the knowledge . In fact , very few people on my planet had it . But it did no good to tell the people this . They thought I was lying . There was a riot , and a mob stormed the guards around our ship and broke into it . I saw my friends torn to pieces while they tried to reason with the mob . Reason ! " But I did what I did , not for revenge , but for a very different motive . I knew that , after we were killed , or even if we were n't , the U.S. government would restore order . And it would have the ship in its possession . It would n't be long before Terrestrialscientists would know how to duplicate it . Inevitably , the Terrestrials would launch an invasion fleet against our world . So , to make sure that Earth would be set back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must do the dreadful thing to save my own world , I sent the signal to the scanner to orbit . I would not have had to do that if I could have gotten to the destruct-button and blown up the ship . But I could not get to the control room . So , I pressed the scanner-activationbutton . A short time later , the mob blew off the door of the room in which I had taken refuge . I remember nothing after that . " Frigate said , " I was in a hospital in Western Samoa , dying of cancer , wondering if I would be buried next to Robert Louis Stevenson . Not much chance , I was thinking . Still , I had translatedthe Iliad and the Odyssey into Samoan . . . Then , the news came . People all over the world were falling dead . The pattern of fatality was obvious . The Tau Cetan satellite was radiating something that dropped human beings in their tracks . The last I heard was that the U.S. , England , Russia , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intercept it , blow it up . And the scanner was on a path which would take it over Samoa within a few hours . The excitement must have been too much for me in my weakened condition . I became unconscious . That is all I remember . "  | " The interceptors failed , " Ruach said . " The scanner blew them up before they even got close . " Burton thought he had a lot to learn about post-1890 , but now was not the time to talk about it . " I suggest we go up into the hills , " he said . " We should learn what type of vegetation grows there and if it can be useful . Also , if there is any flint we can work into weapons . This Old Stone Age fellow must be familiar with stone-working . He can show us how . " They walked across the mile-broad plain and into the hills . On the way , several others joined their group . One was a little girl , about seven years old , with dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Burton , who asked her in twelve languages if any of her parents or relatives were nearby . She replied in a language none of them knew . The linguists among them tried every tongue at their disposal , most of the European speeches and many of the African or Asiatic : Hebrew , Hindustani , Arabic , a Berber dialect , Romany , Turkish , Persian , Latin , Greek , Pushtu . Frigate , who knew a little Welsh and Gaelic , spoke to her . Her eyes widened , and then she frowned . The words seemed to have a certain familiarity or similarity to her speech , but they were not close enough to be intelligible . " For all we know , " Frigate said , " she could be an ancient Gaul . She keeps using the word Gwenafra . Could that be her name ? " " We 'll teach her English , " Burton said . " And we 'll call her Gwenafra . " He picked up the child in his arms and started to walk with her . She burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . The weeping was a release from what must have been almost unbearable tension and a joy at finding a guardian . Burton bent his neck to place his face against her body . He did not want the others to see the tears in his eyes . Where the plain met the hills , as if a line had been drawn , the short grass ceased and the thick , coarse espartolike grass , waist-high , began . Here , too , the towering pines , red pines and lodgepole pines , the oaks , the yew , the gnarled giants with scarletand green leaves , and the bamboo grew thickly . The barn/boo consisted of many varieties , from slender stalks only a few feet high to plants over fifty feet high . Many of the trees were overgrown with the vines bearing huge green , red , yellow , and blue flowers . " Bamboo is the material for spear-shafts , " Burton said , " pipes for conducting water , containers , the basic stuff for building houses , furniture , boats , charcoal even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for eating . But we need stone for tools to cut down and shape the wood . " They climbed over hills whose height increased as they neared the mountain . After they had walked about two miles as the crow flies , eight miles as the caterpillar crawls , they were stopped by the mountain . This rose in a sheer cliff-face of some blue-black igneous rock on which grew huge patches of a bluegreenlichen . There was no way of determining how high it was , but Burton did not think that he was wrong in estimating it as at least 20,000 feet high . As far as they could see up and down the valley , it presented a solid front . " Have you noticed the complete absence of animal life ? " Frigate said . " Not even an insect . " Burton exclaimed . He strode to a pile of broken rock and picked up a fist-sized chunk of greenish stone . " Chert , " he said . " If there 's enough , we can make knives , spearheads , adzes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other things . " " Tools and weapons must be bound to wooden shafts , " Frigatesaid . " What do we use as binding material ? " " Perhaps human skin , " Burton said . The others looked shocked . Burton gave a strange chirruping laugh , incongruous in so masculine-looking a man . He said , " If we 're forced to kill in self-defense or lucky enough to stumble over a corpse some assassin has been kind enough to prepare for us , we 'd be fools not to use what we need . However , if any of you feel self-sacrificing enough to offer your own epidermises for the good of the group , step forward ! We 'll remember you in our wills . "  | " Surely , you 're joking , " Alice Hargreaves said . " I ca n't say I particularly care for such talk . " Frigate said , " Hang around him , and you 'll hear lots worse , " but he did not explain what he meant . Burton examined the rock along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountain itself was some kind of basalt . But there were pieces of chert scattered on the surface of the earth or sticking out of the surface at the base . These looked as if they might have fallen down from a projection above , so it was possible that the mountain was not a solid mass of basalt . Using a piece of chert which had a thin edge , he scraped away a patch of the lichenous growth . The stone beneath it seemed to be a greenish dolomite . Apparently , the pieces of chert had come from the dolomite , though there was no evidence of decay or fracture of the vein . The lichen could be Parmelia saxitilis , which also grew on old bones , including skulls , and hence , according to The Doctrineof Signatures , was a cure for epilepsy and a healing salve for wounds . Hearing stone banging away on stone , he returned to the group . All were standing around the subhuman and the American , who were squatting back to back and working on the chert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others watched , they produced six more . Then each took a large chert nodule and broke it into two with a hammerstone . Using one piece of the nodule , they began to knock long thin flakes from the outside rim of the nodule . They rotated the nodule and banged away until each had about a dozen blades.  |p30They  continued to work , one a type of man who had lived a hundred thousand years or more before Christ , the other the refined end of human evolution , a product of the highest **28;13120;TOOLONG speaking ) of Earth , and , indeed , one of the last men on Earth  --  if he was to be believed . Suddenly , Frigate howled , jumped up , and hopped around holding his left thumb . One of his strokes had missed its target . Katz grinned , exposing huge teeth like tombstones . He got up , too , and walked into the grass with his curious rolling gait . He returned a few minutes later with six bamboo sticks with sharpenedends and several with straight ends . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split the end and inserted the triangular chipped-down point of an axehead into the split end . This he bound with some long grasses . Within half an hour , the group was armed with handaxes , axes with bamboo hafts , daggers , and spears with wooden points and with stone tips . By then Frigate 's hand had quit hurting so much and the bleeding had stopped . Burton asked him how he happened to be so proficient in stone-working . " I was an amateur anthropologist , " he said . " A lot of people  --  a lot relatively speaking  --  learned how to make tools and weapons from stone as a hobby . Some of us got pretty good at it , though I do n't think any modem ever got as skillful and as swift as a Neolithic specialist . Those guys did it all their lives , you know . " Also , I just happen to know a lot about working bamboo , too , so I can be of some value to you . " They began walking back to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was almost directly overhead . They could see for many miles along the river and also across the river . Although they were too far away to make out any figures on the other side of the mile-wide stream , they could see the mushroom-shaped structures there . The terrain on the other side was the same as that on theirs . A mile-wide plain , perhaps two and a half miles of foothills covered withp31trees . Beyond , the straight-up face of an insurmountable black and bluish-green mountain . North and south , the valley ran straight for about ten miles . Then it curved , and the river was lost to sight . " Sunrise must come late and sunset early , " Burton said . " Well , we must make the most of the bright hours . " At that moment , everybody jumped and many cried out . A blue flame arose from the top of each stone structure , soared up at least twenty feet , then disappeared . A few seconds later , a sound of distant thunder passed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton scooped up the little girl in his arms and began to trot down the hill . Though they maintained a good pace , they were forced to walk from time to time to regain their breaths . Nevertheless , Burton felt wonderful . It had been so many years since he could use his muscles so profligately that he did not want to stop enjoying the sensation . He could scarcely believe that , only a short time ago , his right foot had been swollen with gout , and his heart had beaten wildly if he climbed a few steps . They came to the plain and continued trotting , for they could see that there was much excitement around one of the structures . Burton swore at those in his way and pushed them aside . He got black looks but no one tried to push back . Abruptly , he was in the space cleared around the base . And he saw what had attracted them . He also smelled it . Frigate , behind him , said , " Oh , my God ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen too much in his lifetime to be easily affected by grisly sights . Moreover , he could take himself to one remove from reality when things became too grim or too painful . Sometimeshe made the move , the sidestepping of things-as-theywere , with an effort of will . Usually , it occurred automatically . In this case , the displacement was done automatically . The corpse lay on its side and half under the edge of the mushroom top . Its skin was completely burned off , and the naked muscles were charred . The nose and ears , fingers , toes ,  |p32and  the genitals had been burned entirely away or were only shapeless stubs . Near it , on her knees , was a woman mumbling a prayer in Italian . She had huge black eyes which would have been beautifulif they had not been reddened and puffy with tears . She had a magnificent figure which would have caught all his attention under different circumstances . " What happened ? " he said . The woman stopped praying and looked at him . She got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the rock ; he said he was hungry . He said he did n't see much sense in being brought back to life only to starve to death . I said that we would n't die , how could we ? We 'd been raised from the dead , and we 'd be provided for . He said maybe we were in hell . We 'd go hungry and naked forever . I told him not to blaspheme , of all people he should be the last to blaspheme . But he said that this was not what he 'd been telling everybody for forty years would happen and then . . . and then . . . " Burton waited a few seconds , and then said , " And then ? " " Father Giuseppe said that at least there was n't any hellfire , but that that would be better than starving for eternity . And then the flames reached out and wrapped him inside them , and there was a noise like a bomb exploding , and then he was dead , burned to death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corpse to get the wind behind him , but even here the stench was sickening . It was not the odor as much as the idea of death that upset him . The first day of the Resurrection was only half over and a man was dead . Did this mean that the resurrected were just as vulnerable to death as in Earthlife ? If so , what sense was there to it ? Frigate had quit trying to heave on an empty stomach . Pale and shaking , he got to his feet and approached Burton . He kept his back turned to the dead man . " Had n't we better get rid of that ? " he said , jerking his thumb over his shoulder . " I suppose so , " Burton said coolly . " It 's too bad his skin is ruined , though . "  |p33He  grinned at the American . Frigate looked even more shocked . " Here , " Burton said . " Grab hold of his feet , I 'll take the other end . We 'll toss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frigate said . " Yaas . Unless you want to carry him into the hills and chop out a hole for him there . " " I ca n't , " Frigate said , and walked away . Burton looked disgustedly after him and then signalled to the subhuman . Kazz grunted and shuffled forward to the body with that peculiar **31;13150;TOOLONG gait . He stooped over and , beforeBurton could get hold of the blackened stumps of the feet , Kazz had lifted the body above his head , walked a few steps to the edge of the river , and tossed the corpse into the water . It sank immediately and was moved by the current along the shore . Kazz decided that this was not good enough . He waded out after it up to his waist and stooped down , submerging himself for a minute . Evidently he was shoving the body out into the deeper part . Alice Hargreaves had watched with horror . Now she said , " But that 's the water we 'll be drinking ! " " The river looks big enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , we have more things to worry about than proper sanitation procedures . " Burton turned when Monat touched his shoulder and said , " Look at that ! " The water was boiling about where the body should be . Abruptly , a silvery white-finned back broke the surface . " It looks as if your worry about the water being contaminatedis in vain , " Burton said to Alice Hargreaves . " The river has scavengers . I wonder . . . I wonder if it 's safe to swim . " At least , the subhuman had gotten out without being attacked . He was standing before Burton , brushing the water off his hairless body , and grinning with those huge teeth . He was frighteningly ugly . But he had the knowledge of a primitive man , knowledge which had already been handy in a world of primitive conditions . And he would be a damned good man top34have at your back in a fight . Short though he was , he was immenselypowerful . Those heavy bones afforded a broad base for heavy muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , becomeattached to Burton . Burton liked to think the savage , with a savage 's instincts , " knew " that Burton was the man to follow if he would survive . Moreover , a subhuman or prehuman , being closer to the animals , would also be more psychic . So he would detect Burton 's own well-developed psychic powers and would feel an affinity to Burton , even though he was Homo sapiens . Then Burton reminded himself that his reputation for psychismhad been built up by himself and that he was half-charlatan . He had talked about his powers so much , and had listened to his wife so much , that he had come to believe in them himself . But there were moments when he remembered that his " powers " were at least half-fake . Nevertheless , he was a capable hypnotist , and he did believe that his eyes radiated a peculiar extra-sensory power , when he wished them to do so . It may have been this that attracted the half-man . " The rock discharged a tremendous energy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why ? I ca n't believe that the discharge was purposeless . " Burton looked across the mushroom-shape of the rock . The gray cylinder in the center depression seemed to be undamaged by the discharge . He touched the stone . It was no warmer than might have been expected from its exposure to the sun . Lev Ruach said , " Do n't touch it ! There might be another . . . " and he stopped when he saw his warning was too late . " Another discharge ? " Burton said . " I do n't think so . Not for some time yet , anyway . That cylinder was left here so we could learn something from it . " He put his hands on the top edge of the mushroom structure and jumped forward . He came up and onto the top with an ease that gladdened him . It had been so many years since he had felt so young and so powerful . Or so hungry . A few in the crowd cried out to him to get down off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they hoped that another discharge would occur . The majority were content to let him take the risks . Nothing happened , although he had not been too sure he would not be incinerated . The stone felt only pleasantly warm on his bare feet . He walked over the depressions to the cylinder and put his fingers under the rim of the cover . It rose easily . His heart beatingwith excitement , he looked inside it . He had expected the miracle , and there it was . The racks within held six containers , each of which was full . He signalled to his group to come up . Kazz vaulted up easily . Frigate , who had recovered from his sickness , got onto the top with an athlete 's ease . If the fellow did not have such a queasy stomach , he might be an asset , Burton thought . Frigate turned and pulled up Alice , who came over the edge at the ends of his hands . When they crowded around him , their heads bent over the interior of the cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Look ! Steak , a thick juicy steak ! Bread and butter ! Jam ! Salad ! And what 's that ? A package of cigarettes ? Yaas ! And a cigar ! And a cup of bourbon , very good stuff by its odor ! Something . . . what is it ? " " Looks like sticks of gum , " Frigate said . " Unwrapped . And that must be a . . . what ? A lighter for the smokes ? " " Food ! " a man shouted . He was a large man , not a member of what Burton thought of as " his group . " He had followed them , and others were scrambling up on the rock . Burton reached down past the containers into the cylinder and gripped the small silvery rectangular object on the bottom . Frigate had said this might be a lighter . Burton did not know what a " lighter " was , but he suspected that it provided flame for the cigarettes . He kept the object in the palm of his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watering , and his belly was rumbling . The others were just as eager as he ; their expressions showed that they could not understand why he was not removing the food.  |p36The  large man said , in a loud blustery Triestan Italian , " I 'm hungry , and I 'll kill anybody who tries to stop me ! Open that ! " The others said nothing , but it was evident that they expectedBurton to take the lead in the defense . Instead , he said , " Open it yourself , " and turned away . The others hesitated . They had seen and smelled the food . Kazz was drooling . But Burton said , " Look at that mob . There 'll be a fight here in a minute . I say , let them fight over their morsels . Not that I 'm avoiding a battle , you understand , " he added , looking fiercely at them . " But I 'm certain that we 'll all have our own cylinders full of food by supper time . These cylinders , call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left on the rock to be filled . That is obvious , that 's why this grail was placed here . " He walked to the edge of the stone near the water and got off . By then the top was jammed with people and more were trying to get on . The large man had seized a steak and bitten into it , but someone had tried to snatch it away from him . He yelled with fury and , suddenly , rammed through those between him and the river . He went over the edge and into the water , emerging a moment later . In the meantime , men and women were screaming and striking each other over the rest of the food and goods in the cylinder . The man who had jumped into the river floated off on his back while he ate the rest of the steak . Burton watched him closely , half-expecting him to be seized by fish . But he drifted on down the stream , undisturbed . The rocks to the north and south , on both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he was free of the crowd and sat down . His group squatted by him or stood up and watched the writhingand noisy mass . The grailstone looked like a toadstool engulfedin pale maggots . Very noisy maggots . Some of them were now also red , because blood had been spilled . The most depressing aspect of the scene was the reaction of the children . The younger ones had stayed back from the rock , but they knew that there was food in the grail . They were cryingfrom hunger and from terror caused by the screaming andp37fighting of the adults on the stone . The little girl with Burton was dry-eyed , but she was shaking . She stood by Burton and put her arms around his neck . He patted her on the back and murmured encouraging words which she could not understand but the tone of which helped to quiet her . The sun was on its descent . Within about two hours it would be hidden by the towering western mountain , though a genuine dusk presumably would not happen for many hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here . The temperaturehad gone up , but sitting in the sun was not by any means unbearable , and the steady breeze helped cool them off . Kazz made signs indicating that he would like a fire and also pointed at the tip of a bamboo spear . No doubt he wanted to fire-harden the tip . Burton had inspected the metal object taken from the grail . It was of a hard silvery metal , rectangular , flat , about two inches long and three-tenths across . It had a small hole in one end and a slide on the other . Burton put his thumbnail against the projection at the end of the slide and pushed . The slide moved downward about two-sixteenths of an inch , and a wire about one-tenth of an inch in diameter and a half-inch long slid out of the hole in the end . Even in the bright sunlight , it glowed whitely . He touched the tip of the wire to a blade of grass ; the blade shriveled up at once . Applied to the tip of the bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slide back into its original position , and the wire withdrew , like the hot head of a brazen turtle , into the silvery shell . Both Frigate and Ruach wondered aloud at the power contained in the tiny pack . To make the wire that hot required much voltage . How many charges would the battery or the radioactivepile that must be in it give ? How could the lighter 's power pack be renewed ? There were many questions that could not be immediately answered or , perhaps , never . The greatest was how they could have been brought back to life in rejuvenated bodies . Whoever had done it possessed a science that was godlike . But specula/tion about it , though it would give them something to talk about , would solve nothing . After a while , the crowd dispersed . The cylinder was left on its side on top of the grailstone . Several bodies were sprawled there , and a number of men and women who got off the rock were hurt . Burton went through the crowd . One woman 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sobbingwith no one to pay attention to her . Another man was sitting on the ground and holding his groin , which had been raked with sharp fingernails . Of the four lying on top of the stone , three were unconscious . These recovered with water dashed into their faces from the grail . The fourth , a short slender man , was dead . Someone had twisted his head until his neck had broken . Burton looked up at the sun again and said , " I do n't know exactly when supper time will occur . I suggest we return not too long after the sun goes down behind the mountain . We will set our grails , or glory buckets , or lunchpails , or whatever you wish to call them , in these depressions . And then we 'll wait . In the meantime . . . " He could have tossed this body into the river , too , but he had now thought of a use , perhaps uses , for it . He told the others what he wanted , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it across the plain . Frigate and Galeazzi , a formerimporter of Trieste , took the first turn . Frigate had evidentlynot cared for the job , but when Burton asked him if he would , he nodded . He picked up the man 's feet and led with Galeazzi holding the dead man under the armpits . Alice walked behind Burton with the child 's hand in hers . Some in the crowd looked curiously or called out comments or questions , but Burtonignored them . After half a mile , Ka z7 and Monat took over the corpse . The child did not seem to be disturbed by the dead man . She had been curious about the first corpse , instead of being horrified by its burned appearance . " If she really is an ancient Gaul , " Frigate said , " she may be used to seeing charred bodies . If I remember correctly , the Gauls burned sacrifices alive in big wicker baskets at religiousp39ceremonies . I do n't remember what god or goddess the ceremonieswere in honor of . I wish I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever have one here ? I think I would go nuts if I did n't have books to read . " " That remains to be seen , " Burton said . " If we 're not providedwith a library , we 'll make our own . If it 's possible to do so . " He thought that Frigate 's question was a silly one , but then not everybody was quite in their right minds at this time . At the foothills , two men , Rocco and Brontich , succeeded Kazz and Monat . Burton led them past the trees through the waist-high grass . The saw-edged grass scraped their legs . Burtoncut off a stalk with his knife and tested the stalk for toughness and flexibility . Frigate kept close to his elbow and seemed unable to stop chattering . Probably , Burton thought , he talked to keep from thinking about the two deaths . " If every one who has ever lived has been resurrected here , think of the research to be done ! Think of the historical mysteriesand questions you could clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out if Secretary of War Stanton really was behind the Lincoln assassination . You might ferret out the identity of Jack the Ripper . Find out if Joan of Arc actually did belong to a witch cult . Talk to Napoleon 's Marshal Ney ; see if he did escape the firing squad and become a schoolteacher in America . Get the true story on Pearl Harbor . See the face of the Man in the Iron Mask , if there ever was such a person . Interview Lucrezia Borgia and those who knew her and determineif she was the poisoning bitch most people think she was . Learn the identity of the assassin of the two little princes in the Tower . Maybe Richard III did kill them . " And you , Richard Francis Burton , there are many questions about your own life that your biographers would like to have answered . Did you really have a Persian love you were going to marry and for whom you were going to renounce your true identity and become a native ? Did she die before you could marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did you carry a torch for her the rest of your life ? "  |p40Burton  glared at him . He had just met the man and here he was , asking the most personal and prying questions . Nothing excused this . Frigate backed away , saying , " And . . . and . . . well , it 'll all have to wait , I can see that . But dad you know that your wife had extreme unction administered to you shortly after you died and that you were buried in a Catholic cemetery  --  you , the infidel ? " Lev Ruach , whose eyes had been widening while Frigate was rattling on , said , " You 're Burton , the explorer and linguist ? The discoverer of Lake Tanganyika ? The one who made a pilgrimageto Mecca while disguised as a Moslem ? The translator of The Thousand and One Nights ? " " I have no desire to lie nor need to . I am he . " Lev Ruach spat at Burton , but the wind carried it away . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You foul Nazi bastard ! I read about you ! You were , in many ways , an admirable person , I suppose ! But you were an anti-Semite ! " Burton was startled . He said , " My enemies spread that baselessand vicious rumor . But anybody acquainted with the facts and with me would know better . And now , I think you 'd . .. " " I suppose you did n't write The Jew , The Gypsy , and El Islam ? " Ruach said , sneering . " I did , " Burton replied . His face was red , and when he looked down , he saw that his body was also flushed . " And now , as I started to say before you so boorishly interrupted me , I think you had better go . Ordinarily , I would be at your throat by now . A man who talks to me like that has to defend hisp41words with deeds . But this is a strange situation , and perhaps you are overwrought . I do not know . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make another corpse . " Ruach clenched his fists and glared at Burton ; then he spun around and stalked off . " What is a Nazi ? " Burton said to Frigate . The American explained as best he could . Burton said , " I have much to learn about what happened after I died . That man is mistaken about me . I 'm no Nazi . England , you say , became a second-class power ? Only fifty years after my death ? I find that difficult to believe . " " Why would I lie to you ? " Frigate said . " Do n't feel bad about it . Before the end of the twentieth century , she had risen again , and in a most curious way , though it was too late . . . " Listening to the Yankee , Burton felt pride for his country . Although England had treated him more than shabbily during his lifetime , and although he had always wanted to get out of the island whenever he had been on it , he would defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Queen . Abruptly , he said , " If you guessed my identity , why did n't you say something about it ? " " I wanted to be sure . Besides , we 've not had much time for social intercourse , " Frigate said . " Or any other kind , either , " he added , looking sidewise at Alice Hargreaves ' magnificent figure . " I know about her , too , " he said , " if she 's the woman I think she is . " " That 's more than I do , " Burton replied . He stopped . They had gone up the slope of the first hill and were on its top . They lowered the body to the ground beneath a giant red pine . Immediately , Kazz. , chert knife in his hand , squatted down by the charred corpse . He raised his head upward and uttered a few phrases in what must have been a religious chant . Then , before the others could object , he had cut into the body and removed the liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton grunted . Monat stared . Kazz 's big teeth bit into the bloody organ and tore off a largep42chunk . His massively muscled and thickly boned jaws began chewing , and he half-closed his eyes in ecstasy . Burton stepped up to him and held out his hand , intending to remonstrate . Kazz grinned broadly and cut off a piece and offered it to Burton . He was very surprised at Burton 's refusal . " A cannibal ! " Alice Hargreaves said . " Oh , my God , a bloody , stinking cannibal ! And this is the promised afterlife ! " " He 's no worse than our own ancestors , " Burton said . He had recovered from the shock , and was even enjoying  --  a little  --  the reaction of the others . " In a land where there seems to be precious little food , his action is eminently practical . Well , our problem of burying a corpse without proper digging tools is solved . Furthermore , if we 're wrong about the grails being a source of food , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Alice said . " I 'd die first ! " " That is exactly what you would do , " Burton replied , coolly . " I suggest we retire and leave him to his meal . It does n't do anything for my own appetite , and I find his table manners as abominable as those of a Yankee frontiersman 's . Or a countryIli prelate 's , " he added for Alice 's benefit . They walked out of sight of Kazz and behind one of the great gnarled trees . Alice said , " I do n't want him around . He 's an animal , an abomination ! Why , I would n't feel safe for a secondwith him around ! " " You asked me for protection , " Burton said . " I 'll give it to you as long as you are a member of this party . But you 'll also have to accept my decisions . One of which is that the apeman remains with us . We need his strength and his skills , which seem to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; therefore , we can learn from a primitive . He stays . " Alice looked at the others with silent appeal . Monat twitched his eyebrows . Frigate shrugged his shoulders and said , " Mrs. Hargreaves , if you can possibly do it , forget your mores , your conventions . We 're not in a proper upper-class Victorian heaven . Or , indeed , in any sort of heaven ever dreamed of . You ca n't think and behave as you did on Earth . For one thing , youp43come from a society where women covered themselves from neck to foot in heavy garments , and the sight of a woman 's knee was a stirring sexual event . Yet , you seem to suffer no embarrassmentbecause you 're nude . You are as poised and dignified as if you wore a nun 's habit . " Alice said , " I do n't like it . But why should I be embarrassed ? Where all are nude , none are nude . It 's the thing to do , in fact , the only thing that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete outfit , I would n't wear it . I 'd be out of style . And my figure is good . If it were n't I might be suffering more . " The two men laughed , and Frigate said , " You 're fabulous , Alice . Absolutely . I may call you Alice ? Mrs. Hargreaves seems so formal when you 're nude . " She did not reply but walked away and disappeared behind a large tree . Burton said , " Something will have to be done about sanitation in the near future . Which means that somebody will have to decide the health policies and have the power to make regulations and enforce them . How does one form legislative , judicial , and executive bodies from the present state of an-archy ? " " To get to more immediate problems , " Frigate said , " what do we do about the dead man ? " He was only a little less pale than a moment ago when Kazz had made his incisions with his chert knife . Burton said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human gut , properly treated , will be far superior to grass for making ropes or bindings . I intend to cut off some strips . Do you want to help me ? " Only the wind rustling the leaves and the tops of the grass broke the silence . The sun beat down and brought out sweat which dried rapidly in the wind . No bird cried , no insect buzzed . And then the shrill voice of the little girl shattered the quiet . Alice 's voice answered her , and the little girl ran to her behind the tree . " I 'll try , " the American said . " But I do n't know . I 've gone through more than enough for one day . " " You do as you please then , " Burton said . " But anybodyIp44who helps me gets first call on the use of the skin . You may wish you could have some in order to bind an axehead to a haft . " Frigate gulped audibly and then said , " I 'll come . " Kazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the bloody liver with one hand and the bloody stone knife with the other . Seeing Burton , he grinned with stained lips and cut off a piece of liver . Burton shook his head . The others , Galeazzi , Brontich , Maria Tucci , Filipo Rocco , Rosa Nalini , Caterina Capone , Fiorenza Fiorri , Babich , and Giunta , had retreated from the grisly scene . They were on the other side of a thicktrunkedpine and talking subduedly in Italian . Burton squatted down by the body and applied the point of the knife , beginning just above the right knee and continuing to the collarbone . Frigate stood by him and stared . He became even more pale , and his trembling increased . But he stood firm until two long strips had been lifted from the body . " Care to try your hand at it ? " Burton said . He rolled the body over on its side so that other , even longer , strips could be taken . Frigate took the bloody-tipped knife and set to work , his teeth gritted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moment later , " Now you 're not cutting deeply enough . Here , give me the knife . Watch ! " " I had a neighbor who used to hang up his rabbits behind his garage and cut their throats right after breaking their necks , " Frigate said . " I watched once . That was enough . " " You ca n't afford to be fastidious or weak-stomached , " Burton said . " You 're living in the most primitive of conditions . You have to be a primitive to survive , like it or not . " Brontich , the tall skinny Slovene who had once been an innkeeper , ran up to them . He said , " We just found another of those big mushroom-shaped stones . About forty yards from here . It was hidden behind some trees down in a hollow . " Burton 's first delight in hectoring Frigate had passed . He was beginning to feel sorry for the fellow . He said , " Look , Peter ,  |p45why  do n't you go investigate the stone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip back to the river . " He handed Frigate his grail . " Put this in a hole on the stone , but remember exactly which hole you put it in . Have the others do that , too . Make sure that they know where they put their own grails . Would n't want to have any quarrels about that , you know . " Strangely , Frigate was reluctant to go . He seemed to feel that he had disgraced himself by his weakness . He stood there for a moment , shifting his weight from one leg to another and sighing several times . Then , as Burton continued to scrape away at the underside of the skinstrips , he walked away . He carried the two grails in one hand and his stone axehead in the other . Burton stopped working after the American was out of sight . He had been interested in finding out how to cut off strips , and he might dissect the body 's trunk to remove the entrails . But he could do nothing at this time about preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of the oak-like trees might contain tannin which could be used with other materials to convert human skin into leather . By the time that was done , however , these strips would have rotted . Still , he had not wasted his time . The efficiency of the stone knives was proven , and he had reinforcedhis weak memory of human anatomy . When they were juveniles in Pisa , Richard Burton and his brother Edward had associated with the Italian medical students of the university . Both of the Burton youths had learned much from the students and neither had abandoned their interest in anatomy . Edward became a surgeon , and Richard had attended a number of lecturesand public and private dissections in London . But he had forgotten much of what he had learned . Abruptly , the sun went past the shoulder of the mountain . A pale shadow fell over him , and , within a few minutes , the entire valley was in the dusk . But the sky was a bright blue for a long time . The breeze continued to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler . Burton and the Neanderthalleft the body and followed the sounds of the others ' voices . These were by the grailstone of which Brontich had spoken.  |p46Burton  wondered if there were others near the base of the mountain , strung out at approximate distances of a mile . This one lacked the grail in the center depression , however . Perhaps this meant that it was not ready to operate . He did not think so . It could be assumed that Whoever had made the grailstones had placed grails in the center holes of those on the river 's edge because the resurrectees would be using these first . By the time they found the inland stones , they would know how to use them . The grails were set on the depressions of the outmost circle . Their owners stood or sat around , talking but with their minds on the grails . All were wondering when  --  or perhaps if  --  the next blue flames would come . Much of their conversation was about how hungry they were . The rest was mainly surmise about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where They were , and what was being planned for them . A few spoke of their lives on Earth . Burton sat down beneath the wide-flung and densely leaved branches of the gnarled black-trunked " irontree . " He felt tired , as all , except Kazz , obviously did . His empty belly and his stretched-out nerves kept him from dozing off , although the quiet voices and the rustle of leaves conduced to sleep . The hollow in which the group waited was formed by a level space at the junction of four hills and was surrounded by trees . Though it was darker than on top of the hills , it also seemed to be a little warmer . After a while , as the dusk and the chill increased , Burton organized a firewood-collecting party . Using the knives and handaxes , they cut down many mature bamboo plants and gathered piles of grass . With the white-hot wire of the lighter , Burton started a fire of leaves and grass . These were green , and so the fire was smoky and unsatisfactory until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them jump . Some of the women screamed . They had forgotten about watching the grailstone . Burton turned just in time to see the blue flames soar up about twenty feet . The heat from the discharge could be felt by Brontich , who was about twenty feet from it . Then the noise was gone , and they stared at the grails . Bur/ton was the first upon the stone again ; most of them did not care to venture on the stone too soon after the flames . He lifted the lid of his grail , looked within , and whooped with delight . The others climbed up and opened their own grails . Within a minute , they were seated near the fire , eating rapidly , exclaimingwith ecstasy , pointing out to each other what they 'd found , laughing , and joking . Things were not so bad after all . Whoever was responsible for this was taking care of them . There was food in plenty , even after fasting all day , or , as Frigate put it , " probably fasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he explained to Monat , that there was no telling how much time had elapsed between 2008 A.D. and today . This world was n't built in a day , and preparing humanity for resurrectionwould take more than seven days . That is , if all of this had been brought about by scientific means , not by supernatural . Burton 's grail had yielded a four-inch cube of steak ; a small ball of dark bread ; butter ; potatoes and gravy ; lettuce with salad dressing of an unfamiliar but delicious taste . In addition , there was a five-ounce cup containing an excellent bourbon and another small cup with four ice cubes in it . There was more , all the better because unexpected . A small briar pipe . A sack of pipe tobacco . Three panatela-shaped cigars . A plastic package with ten cigarettes . " Unfiltered ! " Frigate said . There was also one small brown cigarette which Burton and Frigate smelled and said , at the same time , " Marihuana ! " Alice , holding up a small metallic scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get our hair back . Otherwise , there 'd be no need for these . I 'm so glad ! But do ... They ... really expect me to use this ? " She held out a tube of bright red lipstick . " Or me ? " Frigate said , also looking at a similar tube . " They 're eminently practical , " Monat said , turning over apacket of what was obviously toilet paper . Then he pulled out asphere of green soap . Burton 's steak was very tender , although he would have pre/ferred it rare . On the other hand , Frigate complained because it was not cooked enough . " Evidently , these grails do not contain menus tailored for the individual owner , " Frigate said . " Which may be why we men also get lipstick and the women got pipes . It 's a mass produc-tion . " " Two miracles in one day , " Burton said . " That is , if they are such . I prefer a rational explanation and intend to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell me how we were resurrected . But perhaps you twentieth-centurians have a reasonable theory for the seemingly magical appearance of these articles in a previouslyempty container ? " " If you compare the exterior and interior of the grail , " Monat said , " you will observe an approximate five-centimeter difference in depth . The false bottom must conceal a molar circuitrywhich is able to convert energy to matter . The energy , obviously , comes during the discharge from the rocks . In addition to the a-m converter , the grail must hold molar templates. . . ? molds . . . ? which form the matter into various combinations of elements and compounds . " I 'm safe in my speculations , for we had a similar converter on my native planet . But nothing as miniature as this , I assure you . " " Same on Earth , " Frigate said . " They were making iron out of pure energy before 2002 A.D. , but it was a very cumbersomeand expensive process with an almost microscopic yield . " " Good , " Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far . . . " He fell silent for a while , thinking of the dream he had when awakening . " Pay up , " God had said . " You owe for the flesh . " What had that meant ? On Earth , at Trieste , in 1890 , he had been dying in his wife 's arms and asking for . . . what ? Chloroform ? Something . He could not remember . Then , oblivion . And he had awakened in that nightmare place and had seen things that were not on Earth nor , as far as he knew , on this planet . But that experience had been no dream.  |p49They  finished eating and replaced the containers in the racks within the grails . Since there was no water nearby , they would have to wait until morning to wash the containers . Frigate and Kazz , however , had made several buckets out of sections of the giant bamboo , The American volunteered to walk back to the river , if some of them would go with him , and fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered . Then , looking at Alice , he knew why . Frigate must be hoping to find some congenial female companionship . Evidently he took it for granted that Alice Hargreaves preferred Burton . And the other women , Tucci , Malini , Capone , and Fiorri , had made their choices of , respectively , Gallea7.7i , Brontich , Rocco , and Giunta . Babich had wandered off , possibly for the same reason that Frigate had for wishing to leave . Monat and Kazz went with Frigate . The sky was suddenly crowded with gigantic sparks and great luminous gas clouds . The glitter of jampacked stars , some so large they seemed to be broken-off pieces of Earth 's moon , and the shine of the clouds , awed them and made them feel pitifully microscopic and illmade . Burton lay on his back on a pile of tree leaves and puffed on a cigar . It was excellent , and in the London of his day would have cost at least a shilling . He did not feel so minute and unworthynow . The stars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever know the delicious taste of an expensive cigar . Nor could it know the ecstasy of holding a warm wellcurvedwoman next to it . On the other side of the fire , half or wholly lost in the grassesp50and the shadows , were the Triestans . The liquor had uninhibitedthem , though part of their sense of freedom may have come from joy at being alive and young again . They giggled and laughed and rolled back and forth in the grass and made loud noises while kissing . And then , couple by couple , they retreatedinto the darkness . Or at least , made no more loud noises . The little girl had fallen asleep by Alice . The firelight flickeredover Alice 's handsome aristocratic face and bald head and on the magnificent body and long legs . Burton suddenly knew that all of him had been resurrected . He definitely was not the old man who , during the last sixteen years of his life , had paid so heavily for the many fevers and sicknesses that had squeezed him dry in the tropics . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old clamoring demon . Yet he had given his promise to protect her . He could make no move , say no word which she could interpret as seductive . Well , she was not the only woman in the world . As a matter of fact , he had the whole world of women , if not at his disposal , at least available to be asked . That is , he did if everybody who had died on Earth was on this planet . She would be only one among many billions ( possibly thirty-six billion , if Frigate 's estimate was correct ) . But there was , of course , no such evidence that this was the case . The hell of it was that Alice might as well be the only one in the world , at this moment , anyway . He could not get up and walk off into the darkness looking for another woman , because that would leave her and the child unprotected . She certainly would not feel safe with Monat and Kaa.7 , nor could he blame her . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Frigate  --  if Frigate returned tonight , which Burton doubted  --  because the fellow was an unknown quantity . Burton suddenly laughed loudly at his situation . He had decided that he might as well stick it out for tonight . This thought set him laughing again , and he did not stop until Alice asked him if he was all right . " More right than you will ever know , " he said , turning hisp51back to her . He reached into his grail and extracted the last item . This was a small flat stick of chicle-like substance . Frigate , before leaving , had remarked that their unknown benefactorsmust be American . Otherwise , they would not have thought of providing chewing gum . After stubbing out his cigar on the ground , Burton popped the stick into his mouth . He said , " This has a strange but rather delicious taste . Have you tried yours ? " " I am tempted , but I imagine I 'd look like a cow chewing her cud . " " Forget about being a lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to resurrect you would have vulgar tastes ? " Alice smiled slightly , said , " I really would n't know , " and placed the stick in her mouth . For a moment , they chewed idly , looking across the fire at each other . She was unable to look him full in the eyes for more than a few seconds at a time . Burton said , " Frigate mentioned that he knew you . Of you , rather . Just who are you , if you will pardon my unseemly curi-osity ? " " There are no secrets among the dead , " she replied lightly . " Or among the ex-dead , either . " She had been born Alice Pleasance Liddell on April 25 , 1852 . ( Burton was thirty then . ) She was the direct descendant of King Edward III and his son , John of Gaunt . Her father was dean of Christ Church College of Oxford and co-author of a famous Greek-English lexicon . ( Liddell and Scottl Burton thought . ) She had had a happy childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of her times : Gladstone , Matthew Arnold , the Prince of Wales , who was placed under her father 's care while he was at Oxford . Her husband had been Reginald Gervis Hargreaves , and she had loved him very much . He had been a " country gentleman , " liked to hunt , fish , play cricket , raise trees , and read French literature . She had three sons , all captains , two of whom died in the Great War of 1914-1918 . ( This was the second time that day that Burton had heard of the Great War. )  |p52She  talked on and on as if drink had loosened her tongue . Or as if she wanted to place a barrier of conversation between her and Burton . She talked of Dinah , the tabby kitten she had loved when she was a child , the great trees of her husband 's arboretum , how her father , when working on his lexicon , would always sneeze at twelve o'clock in the afternoon , no one knew why . . . at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Letters by the American university , Columbia , because of the vital part she had played in the genesis of Mr. Dodgson 's famous book . ( She neglected to mention the title and Burton , though a voraciousreader , did not recall any works by a Mr. Dodgson . ) " That was a golden afternoon indeed , " she said , " despite the official meteorological report . On July 4 , 1862 , I was ten . . . my sisters and I were wearing black shoes , white openwork socks , white cotton dresses , and hats with large brims . " Her eyes were wide , and she shook now and then as if she were struggling inside herself , and she began to talk even faster . " Mr. Dodgson and Mr. Duckworth carried the picnic baskets . . . we set off in our boat from Folly Bridge up the Isis , upstreamfor a change . Mr. Duckworth rowed stroke ; the drops fell off his paddle like tears of glass on the smooth mirror of the Isis , and ... " Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Astonished , he gazed at Alice , whose lips seemed to be moving as if she were conversing at a normal speech level . Her eyes were now fixed on him , but they seemed to be boring through him into a space and a time beyond . Her hands were half-raised as if she were surprised at something and could not move them . Every sound was magnified . He could hear the breathing of the little girl , the pounding of her heart and Alice 's , the gurgle of the workings of Alice 's intestines and of the breeze as it slipped across the branches of the trees . From far away , a cry came . He rose and listened . What was happening ? Why the heighteningof senses ? Why could he hear their hearts but not his ? Hep53was also aware of the shape and texture of the grass under his feet . Almost , he could feel the individual molecules of the air as they bumped into his body . Alice , too , had risen . She said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like a heavy gust of wind . He did not reply , for he was staring at her . Now , it seemed to him , he could really see her body for the first time . And he could see her , too . The entire Alice . Alice came toward him with her arms held out , her eyes halfshut , her mouth moist . She swayed , and she crooned , " Richard ! Richard ! " Then she stopped ; her eyes widened . He stepped toward her , his arms out . She cried , " No ! " and turned and ran into the darkness among the trees . For a second , he stood still . It dad not seem possible that she , whom he loved as he had never loved anybody , could not love him back . She must be teasing him . That was it . He ran after her , and called her name over and over . It must have been hours later when the rain fell against them . Either the effect of the drug had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both seemed to emerge from the ecstasyand the dreamlike state at the same time . She looked up at him as lightning lit their features , and she screamed and pushed him violently . He fell on the grass , but reached out a hand and grabbed her ankle as she scrambled away from him on all fours . " What 's the matter with you ? " he shouted . Alice quit struggling . She sat down , hid her face against her knees , and her body shook with sobs . Burton rose and placed his hand under her chin and forced her to look upward . Lightninghit nearby again and showed him her tortured face . " You promised to protect me ! " she cried out . " You did n't act as if you wanted to be protected , " he said . " I did n't promise to protect you against a natural human im-pulse . " " Impulse ! " she said . " Impulse ! My God , I 've never donep54anything like this in my life ! I 've always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stayed faithful to my husband all my life ! And now . . . a total stranger ! Just like that ! I do n't know what got into me ! " " Then I 've been a failure , " Burton said , and laughed . But he was beginning to feel regret and sorrow . If only it had been her own will , her own wish , then he would not now be having the slightest bite of conscience . But that gum had contained some powerful drug , and it had made them behave as lovers whose passion knew no limits . She had certainly cooperated as enthusiasticallyas any experienced woman in a Turkish harem . " You need n't feel the least bit contrite or self-reproachful , " he said gently . " You were possessed . Blame the drug . " " I did it ! " she said . " I . . . I ! I wanted to ! Oh , what a vile low whore I am ! " " I do n't remember offering you any money . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her so angry that she would forget her self-abasement . And he succeeded . She jumped up and attacked his chest and face with her nails . She called him names that a high-bred and gentle lady of Victoria 's day should never have known . Burton caught her wrists to prevent further damage and held her while she spewed more filth at him . Finally , when she had fallen silent and had begun weeping again , he led her toward the camp site . The fire was wet ashes . He scraped off the top layer and dropped a handful of grass , which had been protected from the rain by the tree , onto the embers . By its light , he saw the little girl sleeping huddled between Kazz and Monat under a pile of grass beneath the irontree . He returned to Alice , who was sitting under another tree . " Stay away , " she said . " I never want to see you again ! You have dishonored me , dirtied me ! And after you gave your word to protect me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I was merely going to suggest that we huddle together to keep warm . But , if you wish discomfort , so be it . I 'll tell you again that what we did was generated by the drug . No , not generated . Drugs do n't generatep55desires or actions ; they merely allow them to be released . Our normal inhibitions were dissolved , and neither one of us can blame ourself or the other . " However , I 'd be a liar if I said I did n't enjoy it , and you 'd be a liar if you claimed you did n't . So , why gash yourself with the knives of conscience ? " " I 'm not a beast like you ! I 'm a good Christian God-fearing virtuous woman ! " " No doubt , " Burton said dryly . " However , let me stress again one thing . I doubt if you would have done what you did if you had not wished in your heart to do so . The drug suppressed your inhibitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what to do . The idea was already there . Any action that resulted from taking the drug came from you , from what you wanted to do . " " I know that ! " she screamed . " Do you think I 'm some stupid simple serving girl ? I have a brain ! I know what I did and why ! It 's just that I never dreamed that I could be such . . . such a person ! But I must have been ! Must be ! " Burton tried to console her , to show her that everyone had certain unwished-for elements in their nature . He pointed out that the dogma of original sin surely covered this ; she was human ; therefore , she had dark desires in her . And so forth . The more he tried to make her feel better , the worse she felt . Then , shivering with cold , and tired of the useless arguments , he gave up . He crawled in between Monat and Kazz and took the little girl in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grass pile and the feel of the naked bodies soothed him . He went to sleep with Alice 's weeping coming to him faintly through the grass cover.  |p56When  he awoke , he was in the gray light of the false dawn , which the Arabs called the wolf 's tail . Monat , Kazz , and the child were still sleeping . He scratched for a while at the itchy spots caused by the rough-edged grass and then crawled out . The fire was out ; water drops hung from the leaves of the trees and the tips of the grass blades . He shivered with the cold . But he did not feel tired nor have any ill effects from the drug , as he had expected . He found a pile of comparatively dry bamboo under some grass beneath a tree . He rebuilt the fire with this and in a short time was comfortable . Then he saw the bamboo containers , and he drank water from one . Alice was sitting up in a mound of grass and staring sullenly at him . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm ! " he said . She crawled out , stood up , walked over to the bamboo bucket , bent down , scooped up water , and splashed it over her face . Then she squatted down by the fire , warming her hands over a small flame . If everybody is naked , how quickly even the most modest lose their modesty , he thought . A moment later , Burton heard the rustle of grass to the east . A naked head , Peter Frigate 's , appeared . He strode from the grass , and was followed by the naked head of a woman . Emerging from the grass , she revealed a wet but beautiful body . Her eyes were large and a dark green , and her lips were a little too thick for beauty . But her other features were exquisite . Frigate was smiling broadly . He turned and pulled her into the warmth of the fire with his hand.  | " You look like the cat who ate the canary , " Burton said . " What happened to your hand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . They were swelled , and there were scratches on the back of the hand . " I got into a fight , " he said . He pointed a finger at the woman , who was squatting near Alice and warming herself . " It was a madhouse down by the river last night . That gum must contain a drug of some sort . You would n't believe what people were doing . Or would you ? After all , you 're Richard Francis Burton . Anyway , all women , including the ugly ones , were occupied , one way or another . I got scared at what was going on and then I got mad . I hit two men with my grail , knocked them out . They were attacking a ten-year-old girl . I may have killed them ; I hope I did . I tried to get the girl to come with me , but she ran away into the night . " I decided to come back here . I was beginning to react pretty badly from what I 'd done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible ; it must have released a lifetime of rage and frustration . So I started back here and then I came across two more men , only these were attacking a woman , this one . I think she was n't resisting the idea of intercourseso much as she was their idea of simultaneous attack , if you know what I mean . Anyway , she was screaming , or trying to , and struggling , and they had just started to hit her . So I hit them with my fist and kicked them and then banged away on them with my grail . " Then I took the woman , her name 's Loghu , by the way , that 's all I know about her since I ca n't understand a word of her language , and she went with me . " He grinned again . " But we never got there . " He quit grinning , and shuddered . " Then we woke up with the rain and lightning and thunder coming down like the wrath of God . I thought that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that God had given us free rein for a day so He could let us judge ourselves . And now we were going to be cast into the pit . " He laughed tightly and said , " I 've been an agnostic since Ip58was fourteen years old , and I died one at the age of ninety , although I was thinking about calling in a priest then . But the littlechild that 's scared of the Old Father God and Hellfire and Damnation , he 's still down there , even in the old man . Or in the young man raised from the dead . " " What happened ? " Burton said . " Did the world end in a crack of thunder and a stroke of lightning ? You 're still here , I see , and you 've not renounced the delights of sin in the person of this woman . " " We found a grailstone near the mountains . About a mile west of here . We got lost , wandered around , cold , wet , jumping every time the lightning struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed with people , but they were exceptionally friendly , and there were so many bodies it was very warm , even if some rain did leak down through the grass . We finally went to sleep , long after the rain quit . When I woke up , I searched through the grass until I found Loghu . She got lost during the night , somehow . She seemed pleased to see me , though , and I like her . There 's an affinity between us . Maybe I 'll find out why when she learns to speak English . I tried that and French and German and tags of Russian , Lithuanian , Gaelic , all the Scandinaviantongues , including Finnish , classical Nahuatl , Arabic , Hebrew , Onondaga Iroquois , Ojibway , Italian , Spanish , Latin , modern and Homeric Greek , and a dozen others . Result : a blank look . " " You must be quite a linguist , " Burton said . " I 'm not fluent in any of those , " Frigate said . " I can read most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike you , I am not master of thirty-nine languages  --  including pornography . " The fellow seemed to know much about himself , Burton thought . He would find out just how much at a later time . " I 'll be frank with you , Peter , " Burton said . " Your account of your aggressiveness amazed me . I had not thought you capableof attacking and beating that many men . Your queasiness . . . " " It was the gum , of course . It opened the door of the cage . "  |p59Frigate  squatted down by Loghu and rubbed his shoulder against hers . She looked at him out of slightly slanted eyes . The woman would be beautiful once her hair grew out . Frigate continued , " I 'm so timorous and queasy because I am afraid of the anger , the desire to do violence , that lies not too deeply within me . I fear violence because I am violent . I fear what will happen if I am not afraid . Hell , I 've known that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He looked at Alice and said , " Good morning ! " Alice replied cheerily enough , and she even smiled at Loghu when she was introduced . She would look at Burton , and she would answer his direct questions . But she would not chat with him or give him anything but a stern face . Monat , Kazz , and the little girl , all yawning , came to the fireside . Burton prowled around the edges of the camp and found that the Triestans were gone . Some had left their grails behind . He cursed them for their carelessness and thought about leavingthe grails in the grass to teach them a lesson . But he event*. ally placed the cylinders in depressions on the grailstone . If their owners did not return , they would go hungry unless someone shared their food with them . In the meantime , the food in their grails would have to be untouched . He would be unable to open them . They had discovered yesterday that only the owner of a grail could open it . Experimentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to touch the grail with his fingers or some part of his body before the lid would open . It was Frigate 's theory that a mechanism in the grail was keyed to the peculiar configuration of skin voltage of the owner . Or perhaps the grail contained a very sensitive detector of the individual 's brain waves . The sky had become bright by then . The sun was still on the other side of the 20,000-foot high eastern mountain . Approximatelya half hour later , the grailrock spurted blue flame with a roll of thunder . Thunder from the stones along the river echoed against the mountain . The grails yielded bacon and eggs , ham , toast , butter , jam , milk , a quarter of a cantaloupe , cigarettes , and a cupful of darkp60brown crystals which Frigate said was instant coffee . He drank the milk in one cup , rinsed it out in water in a bamboo container , filled the cup with water , and set it by the fire . When the water was boiling , he put a teaspoonful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee was delicious , and there were enough crystals to provide six cups . Then Alice put the crystals into the water before heating it over the fire and found that it was not necessary to use the fire . The water boiled within three seconds after the crystals were placed into the cold water . After eating , they washed out the containers and replaced them in the grails . Burton strapped his grail onto his wrist . He intended to explore , and he certainly was not going to leave the grail on the stone . Though it could do no one but himself any good , vicious people might take it just for the pleasure of seeing him starve . Burton started his language lessons with the little girl and Kazz , and Frigate got Loghu to sit in on them . Frigate suggested that a universal language should be adopted because of the many many languages and dialects , perhaps fifty to sixty thousand , that mankind had used in his several million years of existence and which he was using along the river . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , all he knew about was the few square miles he had seen . But it would be a good idea to start propagating Esperanto , the syntheticlanguage invented by the Polish oculist , Doctor Zamenhof , in 1887 . Its grammar was very simple and absolutely regular , and its sound combinations , though not as easy for everybody to pronounce as claimed , were still relatively easy . And the basis of the vocabulary was Latin with many words from English and German and other West European languages . " I had heard about it before I died , " Burton said . " But I never saw any samples of it . Perhaps it may become useful . But , in the meantime , I 'll teach these two English . " " But most of the people here speak Italian or Slovenian ! " Frigate said . " That may be true , though we have n't any survey as yet . However , I do n't intend to stay here , you can be sure of that . "  | " I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get restless ; you had to move on . " Burton glared at Frigate and then started the lessons . For about fifteen minutes , he drilled them in the identification and pronunciation of nineteen nouns and a few verbs : fire , bamboo , grail , man , woman , girl , hand , feet , eye , teeth , eat , walk , run , talk , danger , I , you , they , us . He intended that he should learn as much from them as they from him . In time , he would be able to speak their tongues , whatever they were . The sun cleared the top of the eastern range . The air became warmer , and they let the fire die . They were well into the secondday of resurrection . And they knew almost nothing about this world or what their eventual fate was supposed to be or Who was determining their fate . Lev Ruach stuck his big-nosed face through the grass and said , " May I join you ? " Burton nodded , and Frigate said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grass . A short pale-skinned woman with great brown eyes and lovely delicate features followed him . Ruach introduced her as Tanya Kauwitz . He had met her last night , and they had stayed together , since they had a numberof things in common . She was of Russian-Jewish descent , was born in 1958 in the Bronx , New York City , had become an English schoolteacher , married a businessman who made a millionand dropped dead when she was forty-five , leaving her free to marry a wonderful man with whom she had been in love for fifteen years . Six months later , she was dead of cancer . Tanya , not Lev , gave this information and in one sentence . " It was hell down on the plains last night , " Lev said . " Tanya and I had to run for our lives into the woods . So I decided that I would find you and ask if we could stay with you . I apologize for my hasty remarks of yesterday , Mr. Burton . I think that my observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be considered in the context of your other attitudes . " " We 'll go into that some other time , " Burton said . " At the time I wrote that book , I was suffering from the vile and maliciouslies of the money lenders of Damascus , and they . . . "  | " Certainly , Mr. Burton , " Ruach said . " As you say , later . I just wanted to make the point that I consider you to be a very capable and strong person , and I would like to join your group . We 're in a state of anarchy , if you can call anarchy a state , and many of us need protection . " Burton did not like to be interrupted . He scowled and said , " Please permit me to explain myself . I . . . " Frigate stood up and said , " Here come the others . Wonder where they 've been ? " Only four of the original nine had come back , however . Maria Tucci explained that they had wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by one of the big bonfires on the plains . Then many things had happened ; there had been fights and attacks by men on women , men on men , women on men , women on women , and even attacks on children . The group had split up in the chaos , she had met the other three only an hour ago while she was searching in the hills for the grailstone . Lev added some details . The results of chewing the narcotic gum had been tragic , amusing , or gratifying , depending , apparently , upon individual reaction . The gum had had an aphrodisiac effect upon many , but it also had many other effects . Consider the husband and wife , who had died in Opcina , a suburb of Trieste , in 1899 . They had been resurrected within six feet of each other . They had wept with joy at being reunited when so many couples had not been . They thanked God for their good luck , though they also had made some loud comments that this world was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years of married bliss and now looked forward to being together for eternity . Only a few minutes after both had chewed the gum , the man had strangled his wife , heaved her body into the river , picked up another woman in his arms , and run off into the darkness of the woods with her . Another man had leaped upon a grailstone and delivered a speech that lasted all night , even through the rain . To the few who could hear , and the even fewer who listened , he had dem/onstrated the principles of a perfect society and how these could be carried out in practice . By dawn , he was so hoarse he could only croak a few words . On Earth , he had seldom bothered to vote . A man and a woman , outraged at the public display of carnality , had forcefully tried to separate couples . The results : bruises , bloody noses , split lips , and two concussions , all theirs . Some men and women had spent the night on their knees prayingand confessing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or murdered , or all three . But not everybody had succumbed to the madness . A number of adults had protected the children , or tried to . Ruach described the despair and disgust of a Croat Moslem and an Austrian Jew because their grails contained pork . A Hindu screamed obscenities because his grail offered him meat . A fourth man , crying out that they were in the hands of devils , had hurled his cigarettes into the river . Several had said to him , " Why did n't you give us the cigarettesif you did n't want them ? " " Tobacco is the invention of the devil ; it was the weed created by Satan in the Garden of Eden ! " A man said , " At least you could have shared the cigarettes with us . It would n't hurt you . " " I would like to throw all the evil stuff into the river ! " he had shouted . " You 're an insufferable bigot and crazy to boot , " another had replied , and struck him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , he was hit and kicked by four others . Later , the tobacco-hater had staggered up and , weeping with rage , cried , " What have I done to deserve this , 0 Lord , my God ! I have always been a good man . I gave thousands of pounds to charities , I worshiped in Thy temple three times a week , I waged a lifelong war against sin and corruption , I . . . " " I know you ! " a woman had shouted . She was a tall blueeyedgirl with a handsome face and well-curved figure . " I know you ! Sir Robert Smithson ! "  |p64He  had stopped talking and had blinked at her . " I do n't know you ! " " You would n't ! But you should . I 'm one of the thousands of girls who had to work sixteen hours a day , six and a half days a week , so you could live in your big house on the hill and dress in fine clothes and so your horses and dogs could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your factory girls ! My father slaved for you , my mother slaved for you , my brothers and sisters , those who were n't too sick or who did n't die because of too littleor too bad food , dirty beds , drafty windows , and rat bites , slaved for you . My father lost a hand in one of your machines , and you kicked him out without a penny . My mother died of the white plague . I was coughing out my life , too , my fine baronet , while you stuffed yourself with rich foods and sat in easy chairs and dozed off in your big expensive church pew and gave thousands to feed the poor unfortunates in Asia and to send missionaries to convert the poor heathens in Africa . I coughed out my lungs , and I had to go a-whoring to make enough money to feed my kid sisters and brothers . And I caught syphilis , you bloody pious bastard , because you wanted to wring out every drop of sweat and blood I had and those poor devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the police they should deal harshly with prostitution . You . . . you . . . ! " Smithson had gone red at first , then pale . Then he had drawn himself up straight , scowling at the woman , and said , " You whores always have somebody to blame for your unbridled lusts , your evil ways . God knows that I followed His ways . " He had turned and had walked off , but the woman ran after him and swung her grail at him . It came around swiftly ; somebodyshouted ; he spun and ducked . The grail almost grazed the top of his head . Smithson ran past the woman before she could recover and quickly lost himself in the crowd . Unfortunately , Ruach said , very few understood what was going on because they could n't speak English . " Sir Robert Smithson , " Burton said . " If I remember cor/rectly , he owned cotton mills and steelworks in Manchester . He was noted for his philanthropies and his good works among the heathens . Died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And probably convinced that he would be rewarded in Heaven , " Lev Ruach said . " Of course , it would never have occurredto him that he was a murderer many times over . " " If he had n't exploited the poor , someone else would have done so . " " That is an excuse used by many throughout men 's history , " Lev said . " Besides , there were industrialists in your country who saw to it that wages and conditions in their factories were improved . Robert Owen was one , I believe . " " I do n't see much sense in arguing about what went on in the past , " Frigate said . " I think we should do something about our present situation . " Burton stood up . " You 're right , Yank ! We need roofs over our heads , tools , God knows what else ! But first , I think we should take a look at the cities of the plains and see what the citizens are doing there . " At that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Frigate saw her first . He burst out laughing . " The latest in ladies ' wear ! " She had cut lengths of the grass with her scissors and plaited them into a two-piece garment . One was a sort of poncho which covered her breasts and the other a skirt which fell to her calves . The effect was strange , though one that she should have expected . When she was naked , the hairless head still did not de/tract too much from her femaleness and her beauty . But with the green , bulky , and shapeless garments , her face suddenly becamemasculine and ugly . The other women crowded around her and examined the weaving of the grass lengths and the grass belt that secured the skirt . " It 's very itchy , very uncomfortable , " Alice said . " But it 's decent . That 's all I can say for it . " " Apparently you did not mean what you said about your unconcernwith nudity in a land where all are nude , " Burton said . Alice stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wearing these . Every decent man and woman , that is . " " I suppose that Mrs. Grundy would rear her ugly head here , " Burton replied . " It was a shock to be among so many naked people , " Frigate said . " Even though nudity on the beach and in the private home became commonplace in the late ' 80 's . But it did n't take long for everyone to get used to it . Everyone except the hopelesslyneurotic , I suppose . " Burton swung around and spoke to the other women . " What about you ladies ? Are you going to wear these ugly and scratchy haycocks because one of your sex suddenly decides that she has private parts again ? Can something that has been so public become private ? " Loghu , Tanya , and Alice did not understand him because he spoke in Italian . He repeated in English for the benefit of the last two . Alice flushed and said , " What I wear is my business . If anybody else cares to go naked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Loghu had not understood a word , but she understood what was going on . She laughed and turned away . The other women seemed to be trying to guess what each one intended to do . The ugliness and the uncomfortableness of the clothing were not the issues . " While you females are trying to make up your minds , " Burtonsaid , " it would be nice if you would take a bamboo pail andp67go with us to the river . We can bathe , fill the pails with water , find out the situation in the plains , and then return here . We may be able to build several houses  --  or temporary shelters  --  before nightfall . " They started down the hills , pushing through the grass and carrying their grails , chert weapons , bamboo spears and buckets . They had not gone far before they encountered a number of people . Apparently , many plains dwellers had decided to move out . Not only that , some had also found chert and had made tools and weapons . These had learned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitives in the area . So far , Burton had seen only two specimens of non-Homo sapiens , and these were with him . But wherever the techniques had been learned , they had been put to good use . They passed two half-completed bamboo huts . These were round , one-roomed , and would have conical roofs thatched with the huge triangular leaves from the irontrees and with the long hill grass . One man , using a chert adze and axe , was building a short-legged bamboo bed . Except for a number erecting rather crude huts or lean-tos without stone tools at the edge of the plains , and for a number swimming in the river , the plain was deserted . The bodies from last night 's madness had been removed . So far , no one had put on a grass skirt , and many stared at Alice or even laughed and made raucous comments . Alice turned red , but she made no move to get rid of her clothes . The sun was getting hot , however , and she was scratching under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the intensity of the irritationthat she , raised by strict Victorian upper-class standards , would scratch in public . However , when they got to the river , they saw a dozen heaps of stuff that turned out to be grass dresses . These had been left on the edge of the river by the men and women now laughing , splashing , and swimming in the river . It was certainly a contrast to the beaches he knew . These were the same people who had accepted the bathing machines , the suits that covered them from ankle to neck , and all thep68other modest devices , as absolutely moral and vital to the continuation of the proper society  --  theirs . Yet , only one day after finding themselves here , they were swimming in the nude . And enjoying it . Part of the acceptance of their unclothed state came from the shock of the resurrection . In addition , there was not much they could do about it that first day . And there had been a leavening of the civilized with savage peoples , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudity . He called out to a woman who was standing to her waist in the water . She had a coarsely pretty face and sparkling blue eyes . " That is the woman who attacked Sir Robert Smithson , " Lev Ruach said . " I believe her name is Wilfreda Allport . " Burton looked at her curiously and with appreciation of her splendid bust . He called out , " How 's the water ? " " Very nice ! " she said , smiling . He unstrapped his grail , put down the container , which held his chert knife and handaxe , and waded in with his cake of green soap . The water felt as if it was about ten degrees below his body temperature . He soaped himself while he struck up a conversation with Wilfreda . If she still harbored any resentment about Smithson , she did not show it . Her accent was heavily North Country , perhaps Cumberland . Burton said to her , " I heard about your little to-do with the late great hypocrite , the baronet . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young and beautiful again , and you do n't have to toil for your bread . Also , you can do for love what you had to do for money . " There was no use beating around the bush with a factory girl . Not that she had any . Wilfreda gave him a stare as cool as any he had received from Alice Hargreaves . She said , " Now , have n't you the ruddy nerve ? English , are n't you ? I ca n't place your accent , London , I 'd say , with a touch of something foreign . " " You 're close , " he said , laughing . " I 'm Richard Burton , by the way . How would you like to join our group ? We 've bandedp69together for protection , we 're going to build some houses this afternoon . We 've got a grailstone all to ourselves up in the hills . " Wilfreda looked at the Tau Cetan and the Neanderthal . " They 're part of your mob , now ? I heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stars , come along in 2000 A.D. , they do say . " " He wo n't hurt you , " Burton said . " Neither will the subhuman . What do you say ? " " I 'm only a woman , " she said . " What do I have to offer ? " " All a woman has to offer , " Burton said , grinning . Surprisingly , she burst out laughing . She touched his chestand said , " Now ai n't you the clever one ? What 's the matter , you ca n't get no girl of your own ? " " I had one and lost her , " Burton said . That was not entirely true . He was not sure what Alice intended to do . He could not understand why she continued to stay with his group if she was so horrified and disgusted . Perhaps it was because she preferred the evil she knew to the evil she did not know . At the moment , he himself felt only disgust at her stupidity , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had experienced last night may have been caused by the drug , but he still felt a residue of it . Then why was he asking this woman to join them ? Perhaps it was to make Alice jealous . Perhaps it was to have a woman to fall back upon if Alice refused him tonight . Perhaps . . . he did not know why . Alice stood upon the bank , her toes almost touching the water . The bank was , at this point , only an inch above the water . The short grass continued from the plain to form a solid mat that grew down on the river bed . Burton could feel the grass under his feet as far as he could wade . He threw his soap onto the bank and swam out for about forty feet and dived down . Here the current suddenly became stronger and the depth much greater . He swam down , his eyes open , until the light failed and his ears hurt . He continued on down and then his fingers touched bottom . There was grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water was up to his waist ,  |p70he  saw that Alice had shed her clothes . She was in closer to the shore , but squatting so that the water was up to her neck . She was soaping her head and face . He called to Frigate , " Why do n't you come in ? " " I 'm guarding the grails , " Frigate said . " Very good ! " Burton swore under his breath . He should have thought of that and appointed somebody as a guard . He was n't in actuality a good leader , he tended to let things go to pot , to permit them to disintegrate . Admit it . On Earth he had been the head of many expeditions , none of which had been distinguished by efficiency or strong management . Yet , during the Crimean War , when he was head of Beatson 's Irregulars , training the wild Turkish cavalry , the Bashi-Bazouks , he had done quite well , far better than most . So he should not be reprimanding himself . . . Lev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his skinny body to take off the drops . Burton got out , too , and sat down beside him . Alice turned her back on him , whether on purpose or not he had no way of knowing , of course . " It 's not just being young again that delights me , " Lev said in his heavily accented English . " It 's having this leg back . " He tapped his right knee . " I lost it in a traffic accident on the New Jersey Turnpike when I was fifty years old . " He laughed and said , " There was an irony to the situation that some might call fate . I had been captured by Arabs two years before when I was looking for minerals in the desert , in the state of Israel , you understand . . . " " You mean Palestine ? " Burton said . " The Jews founded an independent state in 1948 , " Lev said . " You would n't know about that , of course . I 'll tell you all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured by Arab guerrillas . I wo n't go into the details ; it makes me sick to recall it . But I escaped that night , though not before bashing in the heads of two with a rock and shooting two more with a rifle . The others fled , and I got away . I was lucky . An army patrolpicked me up . However , two years later , when I was in thep71States , driving down the Turnpike , a truck , a big semi , I 'll describe that later , too , cut in front of me and jackknifed and I crashed into it . I was badly hurt , and my right leg was amputatedbelow the knee . But the point of this story is that the truck driver had been born in Syria . So , you see , the Arabs were out to get me , and they did , though they did not kill me . That job was done by our friend from Tau Ceti . Though I ca n't say he did anything to humanity except hurry up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Burton said . " There were millions dying from famine , even the States were on a strictly rationed diet , and pollution of our water , land , and air was killing other millions . The scientists said that half of Earth 's oxygen supply would be cut off in ten years because the phytoplankton of the oceans  --  they furnished half the world 's oxygen , you know  --  were dying . The oceans were pol-luted . " " The oceans ? " " You do n't believe it ? Well , you died in 1890 , so you find it hard to credit . But some people were predicting in 1968 exactly what did happen in 2008 . I believed them , I was a biochemist . But most of the population , especially those who counted , the masses and the politicians , refused to believe until it was too late . Measures were taken as the situation got worse , but they were always too weak and too late and fought against by groups that stood to lose money , if effective measures were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 're to build houses , we 'd best start immediately after lunch . " Alice came out of the river and ran her hands over her body . The sun and the breeze dried her off quickly . She picked up her grass clothes but did not put them back on . Wilfreda asked her about them . Alice replied that they made her itch too much , but she would keep them to wear at night if it got too cold . Alice was polite to Wilfreda but obviously aloof . She had overheardmuch of the conversation and so knew that Wilfreda had been a factory girl who had become a whore and then had died of syphilis . Or at least Wilfreda thought that the disease hadIp72killed her . She did not remember dying . Undoubtedly , as she said cheerily , she had lost her mind first . Alice , hearing this , moved even further away . Burton grinned , wondering what she would do if she knew that he had suffered from the same disease , caught from a slave girl in Cairo when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mecca in 1853 . He had been " cured " and his mind had not been physically affected , though his mental suffering had been intense . But the point was that resurrection had given everybodya fresh , young , and undiseased body , and what a person had been on Earth should not influence another 's attitude toward them . Should not was not , however , would not . He could not really blame Alice Hargreaves . She was the product of her society  --  like all women , she was what men had made her  --  and she had strength of character and flexibility of mind to lift herself above some of the prejudices of her time and her class . She had adapted to the nudity well enough , and she was not openly hostile or contemptuous of the girl . She had performed an act with Burton that went against a lifetime of overt and covert indoctrination . And that was on the night of the first day of her life after death , when she should have been on her knees singing hosannas because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sin " again as long as she was not put in hellfire . As they walked across the plain , he thought about her , turning his head now and then to look back at her . That hairless head made her face look so much older but the hairlessness made her look so childlike below the navel . They all bore this contradiction , old man or woman above the neck , young child below the bellybutton . He dropped back until he was by her side . This put him behind Frigate and Loghu . The view of Loghu would yield some profit even if his attempt to talk to Alice resulted in nothing . Loghu had a beautifully rounded posterior ; her buttocks were like two eggs . And she swayed as enchantingly as Alice.  |p73He  spoke in a low voice , " If last night distressed you so much , why do you stay with me ? " Her beautiful face became twisted and ugly . " I am not staying with you ! I am staying with the group ! Moreover , I 've been thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . I must be fair . It was the narcotic in that hideous gum that made both of us behave the . . . way we did . At least , I know it was responsible for my behavior . And I 'm giving you the benefit of the doubt . " " Then there 's no hope of repetition ? " " How can you ask that ! Certainly not ! How dare you ? " " I did not force you , " he said . " As I have pointed out , you did what you would do if you were not restrained by your inhibitions . Those inhibitions are good things  --  under certain circumstances , such as being the lawful wedded wife of a man you love in the England of Earth . But Earth no longer exists , not as we knew it . Neither does England . Neither does English society . And if all of mankind has been resurrected and is scattered along this river , you still may never see your husband again . You are no longer married . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died , and , therefore , parted . Moreover , there is no giving into marriage in heaven . " " You are a blasphemer , Mr. Burton . I read about you in the newspapers , and I read some of your books about Africa and India and that one about the Mormons in the States . I also heard stories , most of which I found hard to believe , they made you out to be so wicked . Reginald was very indignant when he read your Kasidah . He said he 'd have no such foul atheistic literaturein his house , and he threw all your books into the fur-nace . " " If I 'm so wicked , and you feel you 're a fallen woman , why do n't you leave ? " " Must I repeat everything ? The next group might have even worse men in it . And , as you have been so kind to point out , you did not force me . Anyway , I 'm sure that you have some kind of heart beneath that cynical and mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was crying . " " You have found me out , " he said , grinning . " Very well . So be it . I will be chivalrous , I will not attempt to seduce you or to molest you in any way . But the next time you see me chewing the gum , you would do well to hide . Meanwhile , I give my word of honor ; you have nothing to fear from me as long as I am not under the influence of the gum . " Her eyes widened , and she stopped . " You plan to use it again ? " " Why not ? It apparently turned some people into violent beasts , but it had no such effect on me . I feel no craving for it , so I doubt it 's habit-forming . I used to smoke a pipe of opium now and then , you know , and I did not become addicted to it , so I do n't suppose I have a psychological weakness for drugs . " " I understood that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You and that nauseating creature , Mr. Swinburne .. . " She stopped talking . A man had called out to her , and , though she did not understand Italian , she understood his obscenegesture . She blushed all over but walked briskly on . Burtonglared at the man . He was a well-built brown-skinned youth with a big nose , a weak chin , and close-set eyes . His speech was that of the criminal class of the city of Bologna , where Burton had spent much time while investigating Etruscan relics and graves . Behind him were ten men , most of them as unprepossessingand as wicked-looking as their leader , and five women . It was evident that the men wanted to add more women to the group . It was also evident that they would like to get their hands on the stone weapons of Burton 's group . They were armed only with their grails or with bamboo sticks.  |p75Burton  spoke sharply , and his people closed up . Kazz did not understand his words , but he sensed at once what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His brutish appearance and the handaxe in his huge fist checked the Bolognese somewhat . They followed the group , making loud comments and threats , but they did not get much closer . When they reached the hills , however , the leader of the gang shouted a command , and it attacked . The youth with the close-set eyes , yelling , swinging his grail at the end of the strap , ran at Burton . Burton gauged the swing of the cylinder and then launched his bamboo spear just as the grail was arcing outward . The stone tip went into the man 's solar plexus , and he fell on his side with the spear sticking in him . The subhuman struck a swinging grail with a stick , which was knocked out of his hand . He leaped inward and brought the edge of the handaxe against the top of the head of his attacker , and that man went down with a bloody skull . Little Lev Ruach threw his grail into the chest of a man and ran up and jumped on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was getting up again . The man went backward ; Ruach bounded up and gashed the man 's shoulder with his chert knife . The man , screaming , got to his feet and raced away . Frigate did better than Burton had expected him to , since he had turned pale and begun shaking when the gang had first challenged them . His grail was strapped to his left wrist whilehis right held a handaxe . He charged into the group , was hit on the shoulder with a grail , the impact of which was lessenedp76when he partially blocked it with his grail , and he fell on his side . A man lifted a bamboo stick with both hands to bring it down on Frigate , but he rolled away , bringing his grail up and blocking the stick as it came down . Then he was up , his head butting into the man and carrying him back . Both went down , Frigate on top , and his stone axe struck the man twice on the temple . Alice had thrown her grail into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fire-sharpened end of her bamboo spear . Loghu ran around to the side of the man and hit him across the head with her stick so hard that he dropped to his knees . The fight was over in sixty seconds . The other men fled with their women behind them . Burton turned the screaming leader onto his back and pulled his spear out of the pit of his stomach . The tip had not gone in more than half an inch . The man got to his feet and , clutching the streaming wound , staggered off across the plains . Two of the gang were unconsciousbut would probably survive . The man Frigate had attackedwas dead . The American had turned from pale to red and then back to pale . But he did not look contrite or sickened . If his expression held anything , it was elation . And relief . He said , " That was the first man I 've ever killed ! The first ! " " I doubt that it 'll be the last , " Burton said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corpse , said , " A dead man looks just as dead here as on Earth . I wonder where those who are killed in the afterlife go ? " " If we live long enough , we might find out . You two women gave a very fine account of yourselves . " Alice said , " I did what had to be done , " and walked away . She was pale and shaking . Loghu , on the other hand , seemed exhilarated . They got to the grailstone about a half-hour before noon . Things had changed . Their quiet little hollow contained aboutp77sixty people , many of whom were working on pieces of chert . One man was holding a bloody eye into which a chip of stone had flown . Several more were bleeding from the face or holding smashed forgers . Burton was upset but he could do nothing about it . The only hope for regaining the quiet retreat was that the lack of water would drive the intruders away . That hope went quickly . A woman told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half to the west . It fell from the top of the mountain down the tip of an arrowhead-shaped canyon and into a large hole which it had only half-filled . Eventually , it should spill out and take a course through the hills and spread out on the plain . Unless , of course , stone from the mountain base was brought down to make a channel for the stream . " Or we make waterpipes out of the big bamboo , " Frigate said . They put their grails on the rock , each carefully noting the exact location of his , and they waited . He intended to move on after the grails were filled . A location halfway between the cataractand the grailstone would be advantageous , and they might not be so crowded . The blue flames roared out above the stone just as the sun reached its zenith . This time , the grails yielded an antipasto salad , Italian black bread with melted garlic butter , spaghetti and meatballs , a cupful of dry red wine , grapes , more coffee crystals , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet paper and a cake of soap , and four chocolate creams . Some people complained that they did not like Italian food , but no one refused to eat . The group , smoking their cigarettes , walked along the base of the mountain to the cataract . This was at the end of the triangularcanyon , where a number of men and women had set up camp around the hole . The water was icy cold . After washing out their containers , drying them , and refilling the buckets , they went back in the direction of the grailstone . After a half mile , they chose a hill covered by pines except for the apex , on which a great irontree grew . There was plenty of bamboo of all sizesp78growing around them . Under the direction of Kazz. and of Frigate , who had spent a few years in Malaysia , they cut down bamboo and built their huts . These were round buildings with a single door and a window in the rear and a conical thatched roof . They worked swiftly and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roofs was finished . Frigate and Monat were picked to stay behind as guards while the others took the grails to the stone . Here they found about 300 people constructing lean-tos and huts . Burton had expected this . Most people would not want to walk a half mile every day three times a day for their meals . They would prefer to cluster around the grailstones . The huts here were arranged haphazardlyand closer than necessary . There was still the problem of getting fresh water , which was why he was surprised that there were so many here . But he was informed by a pretty Slovene that a source of water had been found closeby only this afternoon . A spring ran from a cave almost in a straight line up from the rock . Burton investigated . Water had broken out from a cave and was trickling down the face of the cliff into a basin about fifty feet wide and eight deep . He wondered if this was an afterthought on the part of Whoeverhad created this place . He returned just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not bother to turn away ; Loghu giggled ; Tanya turned red ; the Italian women were used to seeing men leaning against buildings whereverthe fancy took them ; Wilfreda was used to anything ; Alice , surprisingly , ignored him as if he were a dog . And that might explain her attitude . To her , Kazz was not human and so could not be expected to act as humans were expected to act . There was no reason to reprimand Kazz for this just now , especiallywhen Kazz did not understand his language . But he would have to use sign language the next time Kazz proceeded to relieve himself while they were sitting around and eating . Everybody had to learn certain limits , and anything that upset others while they were eating should be forbidden . And that , he thought , included quarreling during mealtimes . To be fair , hep79would have to admit that he had participated in more than his share of dinner disputes in his lifetime . He patted Kazz on top of the breadloaf-shaped skull as he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , figuring that Kazz would find out why when he learned to speak English . But he forgot his intention , and he stopped and rubbed the top of his own head . Yes , there was a very fine fuzz there . He felt his face , which was as smooth as ever . But his armpitswere fuzzy . The pubic area was , however , smooth . That might be a slower growth than scalp hair , though . He told the others , and they inspected themselves and each other . It was true . Their hair was returning , at least , on their heads and their armpits . Kazz was the exception . His hair was growing out all over him except on his face . The discovery made them jubilant . Laughing , joking , they walked along the base of the mountain in the shadow . They turned east then and waded through the grass of four hills before coming up the slope of the hill they were beginning to think of as home . Halfway up it , they stopped , silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them to spread out and to proceed slowly , Burtonled them up the hill . The huts were deserted , and several of the little huts had been kicked or trampled . He felt a chill , as if a cold wind had blown on him . The silence , the damaged huts , the complete absence of the two , was foreboding . A minute later , they heard a halloo and turned to look down the hill . The skin-heads of Monat and Frigate appeared in the grasses and then they were coming up the hill . Monat looked grave , but the American was grinning . His face was bruised over the cheek , and the knuckles of both hands were torn and bloody . " We just got back from chasing off four men and three women who wanted to take over our huts , " he said . " I told them they could build their own , and that you 'd be back right away and beat hell out of them if they did n't take off . ' They understoodme all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile north of ours along the river.  |p80Most  of the people there were Triestans of your time , but about ten , all together , were Chicagoans who 'd died about 1985 . The distribution of the dead sure is funny , is n't it ? There 's a random choice operating along here , I 'd say . " Anyway , I told them what Mark Twain said the devil said , You Chicagoans think you 're the best people here whereas the truth is you 're just the most numerous . That did n't go over very well , they seemed to think that I should be buddy-buddies with them because I was an American . One of the women offered herself to me if I 'd change sides and take their part in appropriating the huts . She was the one who was living with two of the men . I said no . They said they 'd take the huts anyway , and over my dead body if they had to . " But they talked more brave than they were . Monat scared them just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone weaponsand spears . Still , their leader was whipping them up into rushing us , when I took a good hard look at one of them . " His head was bald so he did n't have that thick straight black hair , and he was about thirty-five when I first knew him , and he wore thick shell-rimmed glasses then , and I had n't seen him for fifty-four years . But I stepped up closer , and I looked into his face , which was grinning just like I remembered it , like the proverbial skunk , and I said , Lem ? Lem Sharkko ! It is Lem Sharkko , is n't it ? ' " His eyes opened then , and he grinned even more , and he took my hand , my hand , after all he 'd done to me , and he cried out as if we were long-lost brothers , It is , it is ! It 's Pete Frigate ! My God , Pete Frigate ! ' " I was almost glad to see him and for the same reason he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told myself , This is the crooked publisher that cheated you out of $4,000 when you were just getting started as a writer and ruined your career for years . This is the slimy schlock dealer who cheated you and at least four other writers out of a lot of money and then declared bankruptcy and skipped . And then he inherited a lot of money from an uncle and lived very well indeed , thus proving that crime did pay . This is the man you have not forgotten , not onlyp81because of what he did to you and others but because of so many other crooked publishers you ran into later on . " Burton grinned and said , " I once said that priests , politicians , and publishers would never get past the gates of heaven . But I was wrong , that is , if this is heaven . " " Yeah , I know , " Frigate said . " I 've never forgotten that you said that . Anyway , I put down my natural joy at seeing a familiarface again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a name like that , he got you to trust him ? " Alice said . " He told me it was a Czech name that meant trustworthy . Like everything else he told me , it was a lie . Anyway , I had just about convinced myself that Monat and I should let them take over . We 'd retire and then we 'd run them out when you came back from the grailstone . That was the smart thing to do . But when I recognized Sharkko , I got so mad ! I said , grinning , Gee , it 's really great to see your face after all these years . Especiallyhere where there are no cops or courts ! ' " And I hit him right in the nose ! He went over flat on his back , with his nose spouting blood . Monat and I rushed the others , and I kicked one , and then another hit me on the cheek with his grail . I was knocked silly , but Monat knocked one out with the butt of his spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's awful fast , and what he does n't know about self-defense  --  or offense ! Sharkko got up then and I hit with my other fist but only a glancing blow along his jaw . It hurt my fist more than it hurt his jaw . He spun around and took off , and I went after him . The others took off , too , with Monat beating them on the tail with his spear . I chased Sharkko up the next hill and caught him on the downslope and punched him but good ! He crawled away , begging for mercy , which I gave him with a kick in the rear that rolled him howling all the way down the hill . " Frigate was still shaking with reaction , but he was pleased . " I was afraid I was going to turn chicken there for a while , " he said . " After all , all that had been so long ago and in another world , and maybe we 're here to forgive our enemies  --  and someof our friends  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe we 're here so we can give a little back of what we had to take on Earth . What about it , Lev ? Would n't you like a chance to turn Hitler over a fire ? Very slowly over a fire ? " " I do n't think you could compare a crooked publisher to Hitler , " Ruach said . " No , I would n't want to turn him over a fire . I might want to starve him to death , or feed him just enough to keep him alive . But I would n't do that . What good would it do ? Would it make him change his mind about anything , would he then believe that Jews were human beings ? No , I would do nothing to him if he were in my power except kill him so he could n't hurt others . But I 'm not so sure that killing him would mean he 'd stay dead . Not here . " " You 're a real Christian , " Frigate said , grinning . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the second time that Burton had heard the name Hitler . He intended to find out all about him , but at the momenteverybody would have to put off talking to finish the roofs on the huts . They all pitched in , cutting off more grass with the little scissors they had found in their grails , or climbing the irontrees and tearing off the huge triangular green and scarletlacedleaves . The roofs left much to be desired . Burton meant to search around for a professional thatcher and learn the proper techniques . The beds would have to be , for the time being , piles of grass on top of which were piles of the softer irontree leaves . The blankets would be another pile of the same leaves.  | " Thank God , or Whoever , that there is no insect life , " Burtonsaid . He lifted the gray metal cup which still held two ounces of the best scotch he had ever tasted . " Here 's to Whoever . If he had raised us just to live on an exact duplicate of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of biting , scratching , stinging , scraping , tickling , bloodsucking vermin . " They drank , and then they sat around the fire for a while and smoked and talked . The shadow darkened , the sky lost its blue , and the gigantic stars and great sheets , which had been dimly seen ghosts just before dusk , blossomed out . The sky was indeeda blaze of glory . " Like a Sime illustration , " Frigate said . Burton did not know what a Sime was . Half of the conversation with the non-nineteenth centarians consisted of them explainingtheir references and he explaining his . Burton rose and went over to the other side of the fire and squatted by Alice . She had just returned from putting the little girl , Gwenafra , to bed in a hut . Burton held out a stick of gum to Alice and said , " I just had half a piece . Would you care for the other half ? " She looked at him without expression and said , " No , thanks . " " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any doubt about who is sharing which hut with whom , except for Wilfreda , you , and me . " " I do n't think there 's any doubt about that , " she said . " Then you 're sleeping with Gwenafra ? " She kept her face turned away from him . He squatted for a few seconds and then got up and went back to the other side and sat down by Wilfreda . " You can move on , Sir Richard , " she said . Her lip was curled . " Lord grab me , I do n't like being second choice . You could of asked ' er where nobody could of seen you . I got some pride , too . " He was silent for a minute . His first impulse had been to lashp84out at her with a sharp-pointed insult . But she was right . He had been too contemptuous of her . Even if she had been a whore , she had a right to be treated as a human being . Especiallysince she maintained that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been skeptical about that . Too many prostitutes had to rationalize their profession ; too many had justifying fantasies about their entrance into the business . Yet , her rage at Smithson and her behavior toward him indicated that she was sincere . He stood up and said , " I did n't mean to hurt your feelings . " " Are you in love with her ? " Wilfreda said , looking up at him . " I 've only told one woman that I ever loved her , " he said . " Your wife ? " " No . The girl died before I could marry her . " " And how long was you married ? " " Twenty-nine years , though it 's none of your business . " " Lord grab me ! All that time , and you never once told her you loved her ! " " It was n't necessary , " he said , and walked away . The hut he chose was occupied by Monat and Kazz , Katz was snoring away ; Monat was leaning on his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it tasted more like his native tobacco . However , he got little effect from it . On the other hand , tobacco sometimes gave him fleeting but vividly colored visions . Burton decided to save the rest of his dreamgum , as he called it . He lit up a cigarette , knowing that marihuana would probably make his rage and frustration even darker . He asked Monat questions about his home , Ghuurrkh . He was intensely interested , but the marihuana betrayed him , and he drifted away while the Cetan 's voice became fainter and fainter. " . . . cover your eyes now , boys ! " Gilchrist said in his broad Scots speech . Richard looked at Edward ; Edward grinned and put his hands over his eyes , but he was surely peeking through the spaces between his fingers . Richard placed his own hands overp85his eyes and continued to stand on tiptoe . Although he and his brother were standing on boxes , they still had to stretch to see over the heads of the adults in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her long brown hair had fallen over her face . He wished he could see her expression as she stared down at the basket waiting for her , or for her head , rather . " Do n't peek now , boys ! " Gilchrist said again . There was a roll of drums , a single shout , and the blade raced downward , and then a concerted shout from the crowd mingled with some screams and moans , and the head f ell down . The neck spurted out blood and would never stop . It kept spurting and spurting while the sun gleamed on it , it spurted out and covered the crowd and , though he was at least fifty yards from her , the blood struck him in the hands and seeped down between his fingers and over his face , filling his eyes and blinding him and making his lips sticky and salty . He screamed . . . " Wake up , Dick ! " Monat was saying . He was shaking Burton by the shoulder . " Wake up ! You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering , sat up . He rubbed his hands and then felt his face . Both were wet . But with perspiration , not with blood . " I was dreaming , " he said . " I was just six years old and in the city of Tours . In France , where we were living then . My tutor , John Gilchrist , took me and my brother Edward to see the execution of a woman who had poisoned her family . It was a treat , Gilchrist said . " I was excited , and I peeked through my fingers when he told us not to watch the final seconds , when the blade of the guillotine came down . But I did ; I had to . I remember getting a little sick at my stomach but that was the only effect the gruesomescene had on me . I seemed to have dislocated myself while I was watching it ; it was as if I saw the whole thing through a thick glass , as if it were unreal . Or I was unreal . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marihuana . Its light was enough so that Burton could see him shaking his head . " How savage ! You mean that you not only killed your criminals , you cut their heads off ! In public ! And you allowed children to see it ! " " They were a little more humane in England , " Burton said . " They hung the criminals ! " " At least the French permitted the people to be fully aware that they were spilling the blood of their criminals , " Monat said . " The blood was on their hands . But apparently this aspect did not occur to anyone . Not consciously , anyway . So now , after how many years  --  sixty-three ?  --  you smoke some marihuanaand you relive an incident which you had always believed did not harm you . But , this time , you recoil with horror . You screamed like a frightened child . You reacted as you should have reacted when you were a child . I would say that the marihuana dug away some deep layers of repression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " " Perhaps , " Burton said . He stopped . There was thunder and lightning in the distance . A minute later , a rushing sound came , and then the patter of drops on the roof . It had rained about this time last night , about three in the morning , he would guess . And this second night , it was raining about the same time . The downpour becameheavy , but the roof had been packed tightly , and no water dripped down through it . Some water did , however , come under the back wall , which was uphill . It spread out over the floor but did not wet them , since the grass and leaves under them formed a mat about ten inches thick . Burton talked with Monat until the rain ceased approximatelyhalf an hour later . Monat fell asleep ; Kaz7 had never awakened . Burton tried to get back to sleep but could not . He had never felt so alone , and he was afraid that he might slip back into the nightmare . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which Wilfreda had chosen . He smelled the tobacco before he got to the doorway . The tip of her cigarettep87glowed in the dark . She was a dim figure sitting upright in the pile of grass and leaves . " Hello , " she said . " I was hoping you would come . " " It 's the instinct to own property , " Burton said . " I doubt that it 's an instinct in man , " Frigate said . " Some people in the ' 60 's  --  1960 's , that is  --  tried to demonstrate that man had an instinct which they called the territorial imperative . But . . . " " I like that phrase . It has a fine ring to it , " Burton said . " I knew you 'd like it , " Frigate said . " But Ardrey and others tried to prove that man not only had an instinct to claim a certainarea of land as his own , he also was descended from a killer ape . And the instinct to kill was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained national boundaries , patriotismboth national and local , capitalism , war , murder , crime , and so forth . But the other school of thought , or of the temperamentalinclination , maintained that all these are the results of culture , of the cultural continuity of societies dedicated from earliest times to tribal hostilities , to war , to murder , to crime , and so forth . Change the culture , and the killer ape is missing . Missing because he was never there , like the little man on the stairs . The killer was the society , and society bred the new killers out of every batch of babies . But there were some societies , composed of preliterates , it is true , but still societies , that did not breed killers . And they were proof that man was not descended from a killer ape . Or I should say , he was perhaps descended from the ape but he did not carry the killing genes any longer , any more than he carried the genes for a heavy supraorbital ridge or a hairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic centimeters capacity . " " That is all very interesting , " Burton said . " We 'll go into the theory more deeply at another time . Let me point out to you , however , that almost every member of resurrected humanity comes from a culture which encouraged war and murder and crime and rape and robbery and madness . It is these people among whom we are living and with whom we have to deal.  |p88There  may be a new generation some day . I do n't know . It 's too early to say , since we 've only been here for seven days . But , like it or not , we are in a world populated by beings who quite often act as if they were killer apes . " In the meantime , let 's get back to our model . " They were sitting on bamboo stools before Burton 's hut . On a little bamboo table in front of them was a model of a boat made from pine and bamboo . It had a double hull across the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . It had a single mast , very tall , with a fore-and-aft rig , a balloon jib sail , and a slightly raised bridge with a wheel . Burton and Frigate had used chert knives and the edge of the scissors to carve the model of the catamaran . Burton had decided to name the boat , when it was built , The Hadji . It would be going on a pilgrimage , though its goal was not Mecca . He intended to sail it up The River as far as it would go . ( By now , the river had become The River . ) The two had been talking about the territorial imperative because of some anticipated difficulties in getting the boat built . By now the people in this area were somewhat settled . They had staked out their property and constructed their dwellings or were still working on them . These ranged all the way from lean-tos to relatively grandiose buildings that would be made of bamboo logs and stone , have four rooms , and be two stories high . Most of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountain . Burton 's survey , completed two days before , resulted in an estimate of about 260 to 261 people per square mile . For every square mile of flat plain on each side of The River , there were approximately 2.4 square miles of hills . But the hills were so high and irregular that their actual inhabitable area was about nine square miles . In the three areas that he had studied , he found that about one-third had built their dwellings close to the Riverside grailstone and one-third around the inland grailstones . Two hundred and sixty-one persons per square mile seemed like a heavy population , but the hills were so heavily wooded and convoluted in topographythat a small group living there could feel isolated.  |p89And  the plain was seldom crowded except at mealtimes , because the plains people were in the woods or fishing along the edge of The River . Many were working on dugouts or bamboo boats with the idea of fishing in the middle of The River . Or , like Burton , of going exploring . The stands of bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly replaced . The bamboo had a phenomenal growth . Burton estimated that a fifty-foot-high plant could grow from start to finish in ten days . His gang had worked hard and cut down all they thought they would need for the boat . But they wanted to keep thieves away , so they used more wood to erect a high fence . This was being finished the same day that the model was completed . The trouble was that they would have to build the boat on the plain . It could never be gotten through the woods and down the varioushills if it were built on this site . " Yeah , but if we move out and set up a new base , we 'll run into opposition , " Frigate had said . " There is n't a square inch of the high-grass border that is n't claimed . As it is , you have to trespass to get to the plain . So far , nobody has tried to be hardnosedabout their property rights , but this can change any day . And if you build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get it out of the woods okay and between the huts . But you 'd have to set up a guard night and day , otherwise your stuff will be stolen . Or destroyed . You know these barbarians . " He was referring to the huts wrecked while their owners were away and to the fouling of the pools below the cataract and the spring . He was also referring to the highly unsanitary habits of many of the locals . These would not use the little outhouses put up by various people for the public . " We 'll erect new houses and a boatyard as close to the borderas we can get , " Burton said . " Then we 'll chop down any tree that gets in our way and we 'll ram our way past anybody who refuses us right-of-way . " It was Alice who went down to some people who had huts on the border between the plain and the hills and talked them into making a trade . She did not tell anybody what she in/tended . She had known of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of privacy . These made an agreement and moved into the huts of Burton 's gang on the twelfth day after Resurrection , on a Thursday . By a generally agreed upon convention , Sunday , the first , was Resurrection Day . Ruach said he would prefer that the first day be called Saturday , or even better , just First Day . But he was in an area predominately Gentile  --  or ex-Gentile ( but once a Gentile always a Gentile )  --  so he would go along with the others . Ruach had a bamboo stick on which he kept count of the days by notching it each morning . The stick was driven into the ground before his hut . Transferring the lumber for the boat took four days of heavy work . By then , the Italian couples decided that they had had enough of working their fingers to the bone . After all , why get on a boat and go someplace else when every place was probablyjust like this ? They had obviously been raised from the dead so they could enjoy themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marihuana , the dreamgum , and the nu-dity ? They left without ill feelings on the part of anybody ; in fact , they were given a going-away party . The next day , the twentiethof Year 1 , A.R. , two events occurred , one of which solved one puzzle and the other of which added one , though it was not very important . The group went across the plain to the grailstone at dawn . They found two new people near the grailstone , both of them sleeping . They were easily aroused , but they seemed alarmed and confused . One was a tall brown-skinned man who spoke an unknown language . The other was a tall , handsome , wellmuscledman with gray eyes and black hair . His speech was unintelligible until Burton suddenly understood that he was speaking English . It was the Cumberland dialect of the English spoken during the reign of King Edward I , sometimes called Longshanks . Once Burton and Frigate had mastered the sounds and made certain transpositions , they were able to carry on a halting conversation with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had never encounteredmany of the words or certain grammatical usages . John de Greystock was born in the manor of Greystock in the Cumberland country . He had accompanied Edward I into France when the king invaded Gascony . There he had distinguishedhimself in arms , if he was to be believed . Later , he was summoned to Parliament as Baron Greystock and then again went to the wars in Gascony . He was in the retinue of Bishop Anthony Bee , Patriarch of Jerusalem . In the 28th and 29th years of Edward 's reign , he fought against the Scots . He died in 1305 , without children , but he settled his manor and barony on his cousin , Ralph , son of Lord Grimthorpe in Yorkshire . He had been resurrected somewhere along The River among a people about ninety percent early fourteenth-century English and Scottish and ten percent ancient Sybarites . The peoples across The River were a mixture of Mongols of the time of Kubla Khan and some dark people the identity of which Greystockdid not know . His description fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savages across The River had attacked . Apparently they did so for no other reason than they wanted a good fight , which they got . The weapons were mostly sticks and grails , because there was little stone in the area . John de Greystock put ten Mongols out of commission with his grail and then was hit on the head with a rock and stabbed with the fire-hardened tip of a bamboo spear . He awoke , naked , with only his grail  --  or a grail  --  by this grailstone . The other man told his story with signs and pantomime . He had been fishing when his hook was taken by something so powerful that it pulled him into the water . Coming back up , he had struck his head on the bottom of the boat and drowned . The question of what happened to those who were killed in the afterlife was answered . Why they were not raised in the same area as in which they died was another question . The second event was the failure of the grails to deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixp92cloths . These were of various sizes and of many different colors , hues , and patterns . Four were obviously designed to be worn as kilts . They could be fastened around the body with magnetic tabs inside the cloth . Two were of thinner almost transparent material and obviously made as brassieres , though they could be used for other purposes . Though the cloth was soft and absorbent , it stood up under the roughest treatment and could not be cut by the sharpest chert or bamboo knife . Mankind gave a collective whoop of delight on finding these " towels . " Though men and women had by then become accustomed , or at least resigned , to nudity , the more aesthetic and the less adaptable had found the universal spectacle of human genitalia unbeautiful or even repulsive . Now , they had kilts and bras and turbans . The latter were used to cover up their heads while their hair was growing back in . Later , turbans became a customary headgear . Hair was returning everywhere except on the face . Burton was bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long moustachios and forked beard ; he claimed that their absence made him feel more naked than the lack of trousers . Wilfreda had laughed and said , " I 'm glad they 're gone . I 've always hated hair on men 's faces . Kissing a man with a beard was like sticking my face in a bunch of broken bedsprings . " Sixty days has passed . The boat had been pushed across the plain on big bamboo rollers . The day of the launching had arrived . The Hadji was about forty feet long and essentially consisted of two sharp-prowed bamboo hulls fastened together with a platform , a bowsprit with a balloon sail and a singlep93mast , fore-and-aft rigged , with sails of woven bamboo fibers . It was steered by a great oar of pine , since a rudder and steering wheel were not practicable . Their only material for ropes at this time was the grass , though it would not be long before leather ropes would be made from the tanned skin and entrails of some of the larger riverfish . A dugout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foredeck . Before they could get it into the water , Kazz made some difficulties . By now , he could speak a very broken and limited English and some oaths in Arabic , Baluchi , Swahili , and Italian , all learned from Burton . " Must need . . . whacha call it ? . . . wallah ! . . . what it word ? . . . kill somebody before place boat on river . . . you know . . . merda . . . need word , Burton-naq . . . you give , Burton-naq . . . word . . . word . . . kill man so god , Kabburqanaqruebemss. . . water god . . . no sink boat . . . get angry . . . drown us . . . eat us . " " Sacrifice ? " Burton said . " Many bloody thanks , Burton-naq . Sacrifice ! Cut throat . . . put on boat . . . rub it on wood . . . then water god not mad at us . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Kazz argued but finally agreed to get on the boat . His face was long , and he looked very nervous . Burton , to ease him , told him that this was not Earth . It was a different world , as he could see at a quick glance around him and especially at the stars . The gods did not live in this valley . Kazz listened and smiled , but he still looked as if he expected to see the hideousgreen-bearded face and bulging fishy eyes of **25;13183;TOOLONG from the depths . The plain was crowded around the boat that morning . Everybodywas there for many miles around , since anything out of the usual was entertainment . They shouted and laughed and joked . Though some of the comments were derisive , all were in good humor . Before the boat was rolled off the bank into The River , Burton stood up on its " bridge , " a slightly raised plat/form , and held up his hand for silence . The crowd 's chatter died away , and he spoke in Italian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Promised Land ! We leave you in a few minutes . . . " " If the boat does n't capsize ! " Frigate muttered " ... to go up The River , against the wind and the current . We take the difficult route because the difficult always yields the greatest reward , if you believe what the moralists on Earth told us , and you know now how much to believe them ! " Laughter . With scowls here and there from die-hard religionists . " On Earth , as some of you may know , I once led an expeditioninto deepest and darkest Africa to find the headwaters of the Nile . I did not find them , though I came close , and I was cheated out of the rewards by a man who owed everything to me , a Mister John Hanning Speke . If I should encounter him on my journey upriver , I will know how to deal with him . . . " " Good God ! " Frigate said . " Would you have him kill himself again with remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is that this River may be one far far greater than any Nile , which as you may or may not know , was the longest river on Earth , despite the erroneous claims of Americans for their Amazon and Missouri-Mississippi complexes . Some of you have asked why we should set out for a goal that lies we know not how far away or that might not even exist . I will tell you that we are setting sail because the Unknownexists and we would make it the Known . That 's all ! And here , contrary to our sad and frustrating experience on Earth , money is not required to outfit us or to keep us going . King Cash is dead , and good riddance to him ! Nor do we have to fill out hundreds of petitions and forms and beg audiences of influential people and minor bureaucrats to get permission to pass up The River . There are no national borders . . . " .. as yet , " Frigate said. " .. . nor passports required nor officials to bribe . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we sail off without a by-your-leave from any muckamuck , high , middle orp95low . We are free for the first time in man 's history . Free ! And so we bid you adieu , for I will not say goodbye . . . " " . . . you never would , " Frigate muttered " . . . because we may be back a thousand years or so from now ! So I say adieu , the crew says adieu , we thank you for your help in building the boat and for your help in launching us . I hereby hand over my position as Her British Majesty 's Consul at Trieste to whomever wishes to accept it and declare myself to be a free citizen of the world of The River ! I will pay tribute to none ; owe fealty to none ; to myself only will I be true ! " " Do what thy manhood bids thee do , from none but self expect applause ; " He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not stop his speech . Frigate was quoting lines from Burton 's poem , The Kasidah of Haji Abdu Al-Yazdi . It was not the first time that he had quoted from Burton 's prose or poetry . And though Burton sometimes found the American to be irritating , he could not become too angry at a man who had admired him enough to memorize his words . A few minutes later , when the boat was pushed into The River by some men and women and the crowd was cheering , Frigate quoted him again . He looked at the thousands of handsomeyouths by the waters , their skins bronzed by the sun , their kilts and bras and turbans wind-moved and colorful , and he said , " Ah ! gay the day with shine of sun , and bright the breeze , and blithe the throng " Met on the River-bank to play , when I was young , when I was young . " The boat slid out , and its prow was turned by the wind andp96the current downstream , but Burton shouted orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great handle of the paddleso that the nose swung around and then they were beating to windward . The Hadji rose and fell in the waves , the water hissing as it was cut by the twin prows . The sun was bright and warm , the breeze cooled them off , they felt happy but also a littleanxious as the familiar banks and faces faded away . They had no maps nor travelers ' tales to guide them ; the world would be created with every mile forward . That evening , as they made their first beaching , an incident occurred that puzzled Burton . Kazz had just stepped ashore among a group of curious people , when he became very excited . He began to jabber in his native tongue and tried to seize a man standing near . The man fled and was quickly lost in the crowd . When asked by Burton what he was doing , Kazz said , " He not got . . . uh . . . whacha call it ? ... it . . . it . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several unfamiliar symbols in the air . Burton meant to pursue the matter , but Alice , suddenly wailing , ran up to a man . Evidently , she had thought he was a son who had been killed in World War I. There was some confusion . Alice admitted that she had made a mistake . By then , other business came up . Kazz did not mention the matter again , and Burton forgot about it . But he was to remember . Exactly 415 days later , they had passed 24,900 grailrocks on the right bank of The River . Tacking , running against wind and current , averaging sixty miles a day , stopping during the day to charge their grails and at night to sleep , sometimes stopping all day so they could stretch their legs and talk to others besides the crew , they had journeyed 24,900 miles . On Earth , that distancewould have been about once around the equator . If the Mississippi-Missouri , Nile , Congo , Amazon , Yangtze , Volga , Amur , Hwang , Lena , and Zambezi had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still would not have been as long as that stretch of The River they had passed . Yet The River went on and on , making great bends , winding back and forth . Every/where were the plains along the stream , the tree-covered hills behind , and , towering , impassable , unbroken , the mountain range . Occasionally , the plains narrowed , and the hills advanced to The River-edge . Sometimes , The River widened and became a lake , three miles , five miles , six miles across . Now and then , the line of the mountains curved in toward each other , and the boat shot through canyons where the narrow passage forced the currentto boil through and the sky was a blue thread far far above and the black walls pressed in on them . And , always , there was humankind . Day and night , men , women , and children thronged the banks of The River and in the hills were more . By then , the sailors recognized a pattern . Humanity had been resurrected along The River in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the area that held Slovenes , Italians , and Austrians who had died in the last decade of the nineteenth century , had passed by Hungarians , Norwegians , Finns , Greeks , Albanians , and Irish . Occasionally , they put in at areas which held peoples from other times and places . One was a twenty-mile stretch containing Australian aborigineswho had never seen a European while on Earth . Anotherhundred-mile length was populated by Tocharians ( Loghu 's people ) . These had lived around the time of Christ in what later became Chinese Turkestan . They represented the easternmost extension of Indo-European speakers in ancient times ; their culture had flourished for a while , then died before the encroachment of the desert and invasions of barbarians . Through admittedly hasty and uncertain surveys , Burton had determined that each area was , in general , comprised of about 60 percent of a particular nationality and century , 30 percent of some other people , usually from a different time , and 10 percentfrom any time and place . All men had awakened from death circumcised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , Burton commented , this state had not lasted beyond the first night on this planet.  |p98So  far , they had neither seen nor heard of a pregnant woman . Whoever had placed them here must have sterilized them , and with good reason . If mankind could reproduce , the Rivervalley would be jammed solid with bodies within a century . At first , there had seemed to be no animal life but man . Now it was known that several species of worms emerged from the soil at night . And The River contained at least a hundred speciesof fish , ranging from creatures six inches long to the sperm whale-sized fish , the " riverdragon , " which lived on the bottom of The River a thousand feet down . Frigate said that the animalswere there for a good purpose . The fish scavenged to keep The River waters clean . Some types of worm ate waste matter and corpses . Other types served the normal function of earthworms . Gwenafra was a little taller . All the children were growing up . Within twelve years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if conditions everywhere conformed to what the voyagers had so far seen . Burton , thinking of this , said to Alice , " This Reverend Dodgson friend of yours , the fellow who loved only little girls . He 'll be in a frustrating situation then , wo n't he ? " " Dodgson was no pervert , " Frigate said . " But what about those whose only sexual objects are children ? What will they do when there are no more children ? And what will those who got their kicks by mistreating or torturing animals do ? You know , I 've regretted the absence of animals . I love cats and dogs , bears , elephants , most animals . Not monkeys , they 're too much like humans . But I 'm glad they 're not here . They ca n't be abused now . All the poor helpless animals who were in pain or going hungry or thirsty because of some thoughtless or vicious human being . Not now . " He patted Gwenafra 's blonde hair which was almost six inches long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless and abused little ones , too . " " What kind of a world is it that does n't have children ? "  |p99Alice  said . " For that matter , what kind without animals ? If they ca n't be mistreated or abused any more , they ca n't be petted and loved . " " One thing balances out another in this world , " Burton said . " You ca n't have love without hate , kindness without malice , peace without war . In any event , we do n't have a choice in the matter . The invisible Lords of this world have decreed that we do not have animals and that women no longer bear children . So be it . " The morning of the 416th day of their journey was like every morning . The sun had risen above the top of the range on their left . The wind from upRiver was an estimated fifteen miles per hour , as always . The warmth rose steadily with the sun and would reach the estimated 85 degrees Fahrenheit at approximately2 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth . Burton stood on the " bridge " with both hands on the long thick pine tiller on his right , while the wind and the sun beat on his darkly tanned skin . He wore a scarlet and black checked kilt reaching almost to his knees and a necklace made of the convoluted shiny-black vertebrae of the hornfish . This was a six-foot-long fish with a six-inch-long horn that projected unicornlike from its forehead . The hornfish lived about a hundred feet below the surface and was brought in on a line with difficulty . But its vertebrae made beautiful necklaces , its skin , properly tanned , made sandals and armor and shields or could be worked into tough pliable ropes and belts . Its flesh was delicious . But the horn was the most valuable item . It tipped spears or arrows or went into a wood handle to make a stiletto . On a stand near him , encased in the transparent bladder of a fish , was a bow . It was made of the curved bones protruding from the sides of the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut so that one fitted into the other , a double recurved bow was the result . Fitted with a string from the gut of the dragonfish , this made a bow that only a very powerful man could fully draw . Burton had run across one forty days ago and offered its owner forty cigarettes , ten cigars , and thirty ounces of whiskey for it . The offer was turnedp100down . So Burton and Kazz came back late that night and stole the bow . Or , rather , made a trade , since Burton felt compelled to leave his yew bow in exchange . Since then , he had rationalized that he had every right to steal the bow . The owner had boasted that he had murdered a man to get the bow . So taking it from him was taking it from a thief and a killer . Nevertheless , Burton suffered from thrusts of conscience when he thought about it , which was not often . Burton took The Hadji back and forth across the narrowing channel . For about five miles , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile broad lake , and now it was forming into a narrow channel less than half a mile across . The channel curved and disappeared between the walls of a canyon . There the boat would creep along because it would be buckingan accelerated current and the space allowed for tacking was so limited . But he had been through similar straits many times and so was not apprehensive about this . Still , every time it happened , he could not help thinking of the boat as being reborn . It passed from a lake , a womb , through a tight opening and out into another lake . It was a bursting of waters in many ways , and there was always the chance of a fabulous adventure , of a revelation , on the other side . The catamaran turned away from a grailstone , only twenty yards off . There were many people on the right-side plain , which was only half a mile across here . They shouted at the boat or waved or shook their fists or shouted obscenities , unheard but understood by Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem hostile ; it was just that strangers were always greeted by the locals in a varied manner . The locals here were a short , dark-skinned , dark-haired , thin-bodied people . They spoke a language that Ruach said was probably proto-HamiteSemitic . They had lived on Earth somewhere in North Africa or Mesopotamia when those countries had been much more fertile . They wore the towels as kilts but the women went barebreastedand used the " bras " as neckscarfs or turbans . They occupiedthe right bank for sixty grailstones , that is , sixty miles . The people before them had been strung out for eighty grail/stones and had been tenth-century A.D. Ceylonese with a minorityof pre-Columbian Mayans . " The mixing bowl of Time , " Frigate called the distribution of humanity . " The greatest anthropological and social experimentever . " His statements were not too far-fetched . It did look as if the various peoples had been mixed up so that they might learn something from each other . In some cases , the alien groups had managed to create various social lubricants and lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slaughter of one side by the other , or a mutual near-extermination , or slavery , of the defeated . For some time , after the resurrection , anarchy had been the usual rule . People had " milled around " and formed little groups for defense in very small areas . Then the natural leaders and power seekers had come to the front , and the natural followershad lined up behind the leaders of their choice  --  or of the leaders ' choice , in many cases . One of the several political systems that had resulted was that of " grail slavery . " A dominant group in an area held the weaker prisoners . They gave the slave enough to eat because the grail of a dead slave became useless . But they took the cigarettes , the cigars , the marihuana , the dreamgum , the liquor , and the tastier food . At least thirty times , The Hadii had started to put into a grailstoneand had come close to being seized by grail slavers . But Burton and the others were on the alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Twenty times , boats had put out to intercept them instead of trying to lure them ashore , and The Hadii had narrowly escaped being run down or boarded . Five times , Burton had been forced to turn back and sail downstream . His catamaran had always outrun the pursuers , who were reluctant to chase him outside their borders . Then The Hadii had sneaked back at night and sailed past the slavers . A number of times , The Hadii had been unable to put into shore because the slave states occupied both banks for veryp102long stretches . Then the crew went on half-rations , or , if they were lucky , caught enough fish to fill their bellies . The proto-Hamite-Semites of this area had been friendly enough after they were assured that the crew of The Hadji had no evil intentions . An eighteenth-century Muscovite had warned them that there were slave states on the other side of the channel . He did not know too much about them because of the precipitous mountains . A few boats had sailed through the channel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evil men on the other side . So The Hadji was loaded with bamboo shoots , dried fish , and supplies saved over a period of two weeks from the grails . There was still about half an hour before the strait would be entered . Burton kept half his mind on his sailing and half on the crew . They were sprawled on the foredeck , taking in the sun or else sitting with their backs against the roofed coaming which they called the " fo'c'sle . " John de Greystock was affixing the thin carved bones of a hornfish to the butt of an arrow . The bones served quite well as feathers in a world where birds did not exist . Greystock , or Lord Greystock , as Frigate insisted on calling him for some privateself-amusing reason , was a good man in a fight or when hard work was needed . He was an interesting , if almost unbelievablyvulgar , talker , full of anecdotes of the campaigns inl Gascony and on the border , of his conquests of women , of gossipabout Edward Longshanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was also very hard-headed and narrowmindedin many things  --  from the viewpoint of a later age  --  and not overly clean . He claimed to have been very devout in Earthlife , and he probably told the truth , otherwise , he would not have been honored by being attached to the retinue of the Patriarch of Jerusalem . But , now that his faith had been discredited , he hated priests . And he was apt to drive any he met into a fury with his scorn , hoping that they would attack him . Some did , and he came close to killing them . Burton had cautiously reprimanded him for this ( you did not speak harshly to de Greystock unless you wished to fight to the death with him ) ,  |p103|pointing  out that when they were guests in a strange land , and immensely outnumbered by their hosts , they should act as guests . De Greystock admitted that Burton was right , but he could not keep from baiting every priest he met . Fortunately , they were not often in areas where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of these who admitted that they had been such . Beside him , talking earnestly , was his current woman , born Mary Rutherfurd in 1637 , died Lady Warwickshire in 1674 . She was English but of an age 300 years later than his , so there were many differences in their attitudes and actions . Burton did not give them much longer to stay together . Kazz was sprawled out on the deck with his head in the lap of Fatima , a Turkish woman whom the Neanderthal had met forty days ago during a lunch stop . Fatima , as Frigate had said , seemed to be " hung up on hair . " That was his explanation for the obsession of the seventeenth-century wife of a baker of Ankara for Kazz . She found everything about him stimulating but it was the hairiness that sent her into ecstasies . Everybody was pleased about this , most of all Kazz . He had not seen a singlefemale of his own species during their long trip , though he had heard about some . Most women shied away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had no permanentfemale companionship until he met Fatima . Little Lev Ruach was leaning against the forward bulkhead of the fo'c'sle , where he was making a slingshot from the leather of a hornfish . A bag by his side contained about thirty stones picked up during the last twenty days . By his side , talkingswiftly , incessantly exposing her long white teeth , was Esther Rodriguez . She had replaced Tanya , who had been henpeckingLev before The Hadji set off . Tanya was a very attractiveand petite woman but she seemed unable to keep from " remodeling " her men ; Lev found out that she had " remodeled " her father and uncle and two brothers and two husbands . She tried to do the same for , or to , Lev , usually in a loud voice so that other males in the neighborhood could benefit by her advice . One day , just as The Hadji was about to sail , Lev hadp104jumped aboard , turned , and said , " Goodbye , Tanya . I ca n't stand any more reforming from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's perfect . " Tanya had gasped , turned white , and then started screaming at Lev . She still was screaming , judging by her mouth , long after The Hadji had sailed out of earshot . The others laughed and congratulated Lev , but he only smiled sadly . Two weeks later , in an area predominately ancient Libyan , he met Esther , a fifteenth-century Sephardic Jewess . " Why do n't you try your luck with a Gentile ? " Frigate had said . Lev had shrugged his narrow shoulders . " I have . But sooner or later you get into a big fight , and they lose their temper and call you a goddam kike . The same thing also happens with my Jewish women , but from them I can take it . " " Listen , friend , " the American said . " There are billions of Gentiles along this river who 've never heard of a Jew . They ca n't be prejudiced . Try one of them . " " I 'll stick to the evil I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frigate said . Burton sometimes wondered why Ruach stayed with the boat . He had never made any more references to The Jew , The Gypsy , and El Islam , though he often questioned Burton about other aspects of his past . He was friendly enough but had a certainindefinable reserve . Though small , he was a good man in a fight and he had been invaluable in teaching Burton judo , karate , and jukado . His sadness , which hung about him like a thin mist even when he was laughing , or making love , according to Tanya , came from mental scars . These resulted from his terribleexperiences in concentration camps in Germany and Russia , or so he claimed . Tanya had said that Lev was born sad ; he inherited all the genes of sorrow from the time when his ancestorssat down by the willows of Babylon . Monat was another case of sadness , though he could come out of it fully at times . The Tau Cetan kept looking for one of his own kind , for one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lynch mob . He did not give himselfp105much chance . Thirty in an estimated thirty-five to thirty-six billionstrung out along a river that could be ten million miles long made it improbable that he would ever see even one . But there was hope . Alice Hargreaves was sitting forward of the fo'c'sle , only the top of her head in his view , and looking at the people on the banks whenever the boat got close enough for her to make out individual faces . She was searching for her husband , Reginald , and also for her three sons and for her mother and father and her sisters and brothers . For any dear familiar face . The implicationswere that she would leave the boat as soon as this happened . Burton had not commented on this . But he felt a pain in his chest when he thought of it . He wished that she would leave and yet he did not wish it . To get her out of sight would eventuallybe to get her out of his mind . It was inevitable . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had for his Persian love , and to lose her , too , would be to suffer the same longlivedtorture . Yet he had never said a word about how he felt to her . He talked to her , jested with her , showed her a concern that he found galling because she did not return it , and , in the end , got her to relax when with him . That is , she would relax if there were others around . When they were alone , she tightened up . She had never used the dreamgum since that first night . He had used it for a third time and then hoarded his share and traded it for other items . The last time he had chewed it , with the hope of an unusually ecstatic lovemaking with Wilfreda , he had been plunged back into the horrible sickness of the " little irons , " the sickness that had almost killed him during his expeditionto Lake Tanganyika . Speke had been in the nightmare , and he had killed Speke . Speke had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a suicide even if they had not said so . Speke , tormented by remorse because he had betrayed Burton , had shot himself . But in the nightmare , he had strangled Speke when Speke bent over to ask him how he was . Then , just as the vision faded , he had kissed Speke 's dead lips.  |p106Well  , he had known that he had loved Speke at the same time that he hated him , justifiably hated him . But the knowledge of his love had been very fleeting and infrequent and it had not affected him . During the dreamgum nightmare , he had felt so horrified at the realization that love lay far beneath his hate that he had screamed . He awakened to find Wilfreda shaking him , demanding to know what had happened . Wilfreda had smoked opium or drunk it in her beer when on Earth , but here , after one session with dreamgum , she had been afraid to chew any more . Her horror came from seeing again the death of a younger sister from tuberculosis and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore . " It 's a strange psychedelic , " Ruach had told Burton . He had explained what the word meant . The discussion about that had gone on for a long time . " It seems to bring up traumatic incidentsin a mixture of reality and symbolism . Not always . Sometimesit 's an aphrodisiac . Sometimes , as they said , it takes you on a beautiful trip . But I would guess that dreamgum has been provided us for therapeutic , if not cathartic , reasons . It 's up to us to find out just how to use it . " " Why do n't you chew it more often ? " Frigate had said . " For the same reason that some people refused to go into psychotherapy or quit before they were through ; I 'm afraid . " " Yeah , me , too , " Frigate said . " But some day , when we stop off someplace for a long time , I 'm going to chew a stick every night , so help me . Even if it scares hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say now . " Peter Jairus Frigate had been born only twenty-eight yearsp107after Burton had died , yet the world between them was wide . They saw so many things so differently ; they would have arguedviolently if Frigate was able to argue violently . Not on matters of discipline in the group or in running the boat . But on so many matters of looking at the world . Yet , in many ways , Frigate was much like Burton , and it may have been this that had caused him to be so fascinated by Burton on Earth . Frigatehad picked up in 1938 a soft-cover book by Fairfax Downeytitled Burton : Arabian Nights ' Adventurer . The front page illustration was of Burton at the age of fifty . The savage face , the high brow and prominent supraorbital ridges , the heavy black brows , the straight but harsh nose , the great scar on his cheek , the thick " sensual " lips , the heavy downdrooping moustache , the heavy forked beard , the essential broodingness and aggressiveness of the face , had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of you before , Dick , " Frigate said . " But I read the book at once and was fascinated . There was something about you , aside from the obvious daring-do of your life , your swordsmanship , mastery of many languages , disguises as a nativedoctor , native merchantman , as a pilgrim to Mecca , the first European to get out of the sacred city of Harar alive , discovererof Lake Tanganyika and near-discoverer of the source of the Nile , co-founder of the Royal Anthropological Society , inventor of the term ESP , translator of the Arabian Nights , student of the sexual practices of the East , and so forth . . . " Aside from all this , fascinating enough in itself , you had a special affinity for me . I went to the public library  --  Peoria was a small city but had many books on you and about you , donatedby some admirer of yours who 'd passed on  --  and I read these . Then I started to collect first editions by you and about you . I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge definitive biography of you , travel everywhere you had been , take photographs and notes of these places , found a societyto collect funds for the preservation of your tomb . . . " This was the first time Frigate had mentioned his tomb . Burton , startled , said , " Where ? " Then , " Oh , of course ! Mortlake !  |p108I  'd forgotten ! Was the tomb really in the form of an Arab tent , as Isabel and I had planned ? " " Sure . But the cemetery was swallowed up in a slum , the tomb was defaced by vandals , there were weeds up to your tocus and talk of moving the bodies to a more remote section of England , though by then it was hard to find a really remote sec-tion . " " And did you found your society and preserve my tomb ? " Burton said . He had gotten used to the idea by then of having been dead , but to talk with someone who had seen his tomb made his skin chill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " No . By the time I was in a position to do that , I would have felt guilty spending time and money on the dead . The world was in too much of a mess . The living needed all the attention they could get . Pollution , poverty , oppression , and so forth . These were the important things . " " And that giant definitive biography ? " Again , Frigate spoke apologetically . " When I first read about you , I thought I was the only one deeply interested in you or even aware of you . But there was an upsurge of interest in you in the ' 60 's . Quite a few books were written about you and even one about your wife . " " Isabel ? Someone wrote a book about her ? Why ? " Frigate had grinned . " She was a pretty interesting woman . Very aggravating , I 'll admit , pitifully superstitious and schizophrenicand self-fooling . Very few would ever forgive her for burning your manuscripts and your journals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bum . . . ? " Frigate nodded and said , " What your doctor , Grenfell Baker , described as the ruthless holocaust that followed his lamented death . ' She burned your translation of The Perfumed Garden , claiming you would not have wanted to publish it unless you needed the money for it , and you did n't need it , of course , because you were now dead . " Burton was speechless for one of the few times in his life.  |p109Frigate  looked out of the corner of his eyes at Burton and grinned . He seemed to be enjoying Burton 's distress . " Burning The Perfumed Garden was n't so bad , though bad enough . But to burn both sets of your journals , the private ones in which , supposedly , you let loose all your deepest thoughts and most burning hates , and even the public ones , the diary of daily events , well , I never forgave her ! Neither did a lot of people . That was a great loss ; only one of your notebooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the bombing of Londonin World War II . " He paused and said , " Is it true that you converted to the Catholic Church on your deathbed , as your wife claimed ? " " I may have , " Burton said . " Isabel had been after me for years to convert , though she never dared urge me directly . When I was so sick there , at the last , I may have told her I would do so in order to make her happy . She was so griefstricken , so distressed , so afraid my soul would burn in Hell . " " Then you did love her ? " Frigate had said . " I would have done the same for a dog , " Burton replied . " For somebody who can be so upsettingly frank and direct , you can be very ambiguous at times . " This conversation had taken place about two months after First Day , A.R . 1 . The result had been something like that which Doctor Johnson would have felt on encountering another Boswell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frigate became closer but , at the same time , more of an annoyance . The American had always been restrained in his commentson Burton 's attitudes , undoubtedly because he did not want to anger him . Frigate made a very conscious effort not to anger anybody . But he also made unconscious efforts to antagonizethem . His hostilities came out in many subtle , and some not so subtle , actions and words . Burton did not like this . He was direct , not at all afraid of anger . Perhaps , as Frigate pointed out , he was too eager for hostile confrontations . One evening , as they were sitting around a fire under a grailstone , Frigate had spoken about Karachi . This village ,  |p110which  later became the capital of Pakistan , the nation created in 1947 , had only 2,000 population in Burton 's time . By 1970 , its population was approximately 2,000,000 . That led to Frigate'sasking , rather indirectly , about the report Burton had made to his general , Sir Robert Napier , on houses of male prostitutionin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret files of the East India Army , but it was found by one of the many enemies of Burton . Though the report was never mentioned publicly , it had been used against him throughout his life . Burton had disguised himself as a native in order to get into the house and make observations that no European would have been allowed to make . He had been proud that he had escapeddetection , and he had taken the unsavory job because he was the only one who could do it and because his beloved leader , Napier , had asked him to . Burton had replied to Frigate 's questions somewhat surlily . Alice had angered him earlier that day  --  she seemed to be able to do so very easily lately  --  and he was thinking of a way to anger her . Now he seized upon the opportunity given him by Frigate . He launched into an uninhibited account of what went on in the Karachi houses . Ruach finally got up and walked away . Frigate looked as if he were sick , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kazz and Monat kept stolid expressions . Gwenafra was sleeping on the boat , so Burtondid not have to take her into account . Loghu seemed to be fascinated but also slightly repulsed . Alice , his main target , turned pale and then , later , red . Finally , she rose and said , " Really , Mr. Burton , I had thought you were low before . But to brag of this . . . this . . . you are utterly contemptible , degenerate , and repulsive . Not that I believea word of what you 've been telling me . I ca n't believe that anybody would behave as you claim you did and then boast about it . You are living up to your reputation as a man who likes to shock others no matter what damage it does to his own reputation . " She had walked off into the darkness . Frigate had said , " Sometime , maybe , you will tell me howp111much of that is true . I used to think as she did . But when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one biographermade a psychoanalysis of you based on your own writing and various documentary sources . " " And the conclusions ? " Burton said mockingly . " Later , Dick , " Frigate said . " Ruffian Dick , " he added , and he , too , left . Now , standing at the tiller , watching the sun beat down on the group , listening to the hissing of water cut by the two sharp prows , and the creaking of rigging , he wondered what lay ahead on the other side of the canyonlike channel . Not the end of The River , surely . That would probably go on forever . But the end of the group might be near . They had been cooped up too long together . Too many days had been spent on the narrow deck with too little to do except talk or help sail the ship . They were rubbing each other raw and had been doing it for a long time . Even Wilfreda had been quiet and unresponsive lately . Not that he had been too stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hate her or wish her any ill . He was just tired of her , and the fact that he could have her and not have Alice Hargreavesmade him even more tired of her . Lev Ruach was staying away from him or speaking as little as possible , and Lev was arguing even more with Esther about his dietary habits and his daydreaming and why did n't he ever talk to her ? Frigate was mad at him about something . But Frigate would never come out and say anything , the coward , until he was driven into a corner and tormented into a mindless rage . Loghu was angry and scornful of Frigate because he was as sullen with her as with the others . Loghu was also angry with him , Burton , because he had turned her down when they had been alone gathering bamboo in the hills several weeks ago . He had told her no , adding that he had no moral scruples against making love to her , but that he would not betray Frigate or any other member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not love Frigate ; it was just that she needed a change now and then . Just as Frigate did.  |p112Alice  had said that she was about to give up hope of ever seeing anybody she knew again . They must have passed an estimated44,370,000 people , at least , and not once had she seen anybody she had known on Earth . She had seen some that she had mistaken for old acquaintances . And she admitted that she had only seen a small percentage of the 44,370,000 at close range or even at far range . But that did not matter . She was getting abysmally depressed and weary of sitting on this cramped foredeck all day with her only exercise handling the tiller or the rigging or opening and closing her lips with conversation , most of it inane . Burton did not want to admit it , but he was afraid that she might leave . She might just get off at the next stop , walk off onto the shore with her grail and a few belongings , and say goodbye . See you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing keeping her on the boat so far had been Gwenafra . She was raising the little ancient Briton as a **47;13210;TOOLONG . This was a most curious mixture , but not any more curious than anything else along The River . Burton himself was weary of the eternal voyaging on the little vessel . He wanted to find some hospitable area and settle down there to rest , then to study , to engage in local activities , to get his land legs back , and allow the drive to get out and away to build up again . But he wanted to do it with Alice as his hutmate . " The fortune of the man who sits also sits , " he muttered . He would have to take action with Alice ; he had been a gentleman long enough . He would woo her ; he would take her by storm . He had been an aggressive lover when a young man , then he had gotten used to being the loved , not the lover , after he got married . And his old habit patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was an old person in a new body . The Hadji entered the dark and turbulent channel . The blueblackrock walls rose on both sides and the boat went down a curve and the broad lake behind was lost . Everybody was busy then , jumping to handle the sails as Burton took The Hadjip113back and forth in the quarter-mile wide stream and against a current that raised high waves . The boat rose and clipped sharply and heeled far over when they changed course abruptly . It often came within a few feet of the canyon walls , where the waves slapped massively against the rock . But he had been sailing the boat so long that he had become a part of it , and his crew had worked with him so long that they could anticipate his orders , though they never acted ahead of them . The passage took about thirty minutes . It caused anxiety in some  --  no doubt of Frigate and Ruach being worried  --  but it also exhilarated all of them . The boredom and the sullenness were , temporarily , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine of another lake . This was about four miles wide and stretched northward as far as they could see . The mountains abruptly fell away ; the plains on both sides resumed the usual mile width . There were fifty or so craft in view , ranging from pine dugoutsto two-masted bamboo boats . Most of them seemed to be engaged in fishing . To the left , a mile away , was the ubiquitous grailstone , and along the shore were dark figures . Behind them , on the plains and hills , were bamboo huts in the usual style of what Frigate called Neo-Polynesian or , sometimes , Post-MortemRiparian Architecture . On the right , about half a mile from the exit of the canyon , was a large log fort . Before it were ten massive log docks with a variety of large and small boats . A few minutes after The Hadji appeared , drums began beating . These could be hollow logs or drums made with tanned fishskin or human skin . There was already a crowd in front of the fort , but a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts behind it . They piled into the boats , and these cast off . On the left bank , the dark figures were launching dugouts , canoes , and single-masted boats . It looked as if both shores were sending boats out in a competitionto seize The Hadji first . Burton took the boat back and forth as required , cutting in between the other boats several times . The men on the rightp114were closer ; they were white and well armed , but they made no effort to use their bows . A man standing in the prow of a warcanoewith thirty paddlers shouted at them , in German , to surrender . " You will not be harmed ! " " We come in peace ! " Frigate bawled at him . " He knows that ! " Burton said . " It 's evident that we few are n't going to attack them ! " Drums were beating on both sides of The River now . It sounded as if the lake shores were alive with drums . And the shores were certainly alive with men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercept them . Behind them , the boats that had first gone out were pursuing but losing distance . Burton hesitated . Should he bring The Hadji on around and go back through the channel and then return at night ? It would be a dangerous maneuver , because the 20,000-foot-high walls would block out the light from the blazing stars and gas sheets . They would be almost blind . And this craft did seem to be faster than anything the enemy had . So far , that is . Far in the distance , tall sails were coming swiftly toward him . Still , they had the wind and current behind them , and if he avoided them , could they outstrip him when they , too , had to tack ? All the vessels he had seen so far had been loaded with men , thus slowing them down . Even a boat that had the same potentialitiesas The Hadji would not keep up with her if she were loaded with warriors . He decided to keep on running upRiver . Ten minutes later , as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This held sixteen paddlers on each side and supported a small deck in the bow and the stern . Two men stood on each deck beside a catapult mounted on a wooden pedestal . The two in the bow placed a round objectwhich sputtered smoke in the pocket of the catapult . One pulled the catch , and the arm of the machine banged against the crossbeam . The canoe shuddered , and there was a slight halt in the deep rhythmic grunting of the paddlers . The smok/ing object flew in a high are until it was about twenty feet in front of The Hadji and ten feet above the water . It exploded with a loud noise and much black smoke , quickly cleared away by the breeze . Some of the women screamed , and a man shouted . He thought , there is sulfur in this area . Otherwise , they would not have been able to make gunpowder . He called to Loghu and Esther Rodriguez to take over at the tiller . Both women were pale , but they seemed calm enough , althoughneither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put inside the fo'c'sle . Alice had a yew bow in her hand and a quiver of arrows strapped to her back . Her pale skin contrasted shockingly with the red lipstick and the green eyelid-makeup . But she had been through at least ten running battles on the water , and her nerves were as steady as the chalk cliffs of Dover . Moreover , she was the best archer of the lot . Burton was a superb marksman with a firearm but he lacked practice with the bow . Kazz could draw the riverdragonhornbow even deeper than Burton , but his marksmanship was abominable . Frigate claimed it would never be very good ; like most preliterates , he lacked a development of the sense of perspective . The catapult men did not fit another bomb to the machine . Evidently , the bomb had been a warning to stop . Burton intended to stop for nothing . Their pursuers could have shot them full of arrows several times . That they had refrained meant that they wanted The Hadji crew alive . The canoe , water boiling from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unison , passed closely to the stern of The Hadji . The two men on the foredeck leaped outward , and the canoe rocked . One man splashed into the water , his fingertips striking the edge of the deck . The other landed on his knees on the edge . He gripped a bamboo knife between his teeth ; his belt held two sheaths , one with a small stone axe and the other with a hornfish stiletto . For a second , as he tried to grab onto the wet planking and pull himself up , he stared upwardinto Burton 's eyes . His hair was a rich yellow , his eyesp116were a pale blue , and his face was classically handsome . His intentionwas probably to wound one or two of the crew and then to dive off , maybe with a woman in his arms . While he kept The Hadji crew busy , his fellows would sail up and engage The Hadji and pour aboard , and that would be that . He did not have much chance of carrying out his plan , probablyknew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared death because the fear was in the cells of their bodies , and they reacted instinctively . A few had overcome their fear , and others had never really felt it . Burton stepped up and banged the man on the side of the head with his axe . The man 's mouth opened ; the bamboo knife fell out ; he collapsed face down on the deck . Burton picked up the knife , untied the man 's belt , and shoved him off into the water with his foot . At that , a roar came from the men in the warcanoe , which was turning around . Burton saw that the shore was coming up fast , and he gave orders to tack . The vessel swung around , and the boom swung by . Then they were beating across The River , with a dozen boats speeding toward them . Three were four-man dugouts , four were big warcanoes , and five were two-masted schooners . The latter held a number of catapults and many men on the decks . Halfway across The River , Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailships to get much closer , but he had calculated for that . Now , sailing close-hauled again , The Hadji cut water between the two schooners . They were so close that he could clearly see the features of all aboard both craft . They were mostly Caucasian , though they ranged from very dark to Nordic pale . The captain of the boat on the portside shouted in German at Burton , demanding that he surrender . " We will not harm you if you give up , but we will torture you if you continue to fight ! " He spoke German with an accent that sounded Hungarian . For reply , Burton and Alice shot arrows . Alice 's shaft missedthe captain but hit the helmsman , and he staggered back andfell over the railing . The craft immediately veered . The captainp117sprang to the wheel , and Burton 's second shaft went through the back of his knee . Both schooners struck slantingly with a great crash and shot off with much tearing up of timbers , men screaming and falling onto the decks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would be out of action . But just before they hit , their archers had put a dozen flaming arrows into the bamboo sails of The Hadji . The shafts carried dry grass which had been soaked with turpentine made from pine resin , and these , fanned by the wind , spread the flames quickly . Burton took the tiller back from the women and shouted orders . The crew dipped fired-clay vessels and their open grails into The River and then threw the water on the flames . Loghu , who could climb like a monkey , went up the mast with a rope around her shoulder . She let the rope down and pulled up the containers of water . This permitted the other schooners and several canoes to draw close . One was on a course which would put it directly in the path of The Hadji . Burton swung the boat around again , but it was sluggish because of Loghu 's weight on the mast . It wheeled around , the boom swung wildly as the men failed to keep control of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fire . Several arrows thunked into the deck . For a moment , Burton thought that the enemy had changed his mind and was trying to down them . But the arrows were just misdirected . Again , The Hadji sliced between two schooners . The captainsand the crews of both were grinning . Perhaps they had been bored for a long time and were enjoying the pursuit . Even so , the crews ducked behind the railings , leaving the officers , helmsmen , and the archers to receive the fire from The Hadji . There was a strumming , and dark streaks with red heads and blue tails went halfway through the sails in two dozen places , a number drove into the mast or the boom , a dozen hissed into the water , one shot by Burton a few inches from his head . Alice , Ruach , Kazz , de Greystock , Wilfreda , and he had shotp118while Esther handled the tiller . Loghu was frozen halfway up the mast , waiting until the arrow fire quit . The five arrows found three targets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor who stuck his head up at the wrong time for him . Esther screamed , and Burton spun . The warcanoe had come out from behind the schooner and was a few feet in front of The Hadji 's bow . There was no way to avoid a collision . The two men on the platform were diving off the side , and the paddlers were standing up or trying to stand up so they could get overboard . Then The Hadji smashed into its port near the bow , cracking it open , turning it over , and spilling its crew into The River . Those on The Hadji were thrown forward , and de Greystock went into the water . Burton slid on his face and chest and knees , burning off the skin . Esther had been torn from the tiller and rolled across the deck until she thumped against the edge of the fo'c'sle coaming . She lay there without moving . Burton looked upward . The sail was blazing away beyond hope of being saved . Loghu was gone , so she must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting up , he saw her and de Greystock swimming back to The Hadji . The water around them was boiling with the splashing of the dispossessed canoemen , many of whom , judging by their cries , could not swim . Burton called to the men to help the two aboard while he inspected the damage . Both prows of the very thin twin hulls had been smashed open by the crash . Water was pouring inside . And the smoke from the burning sail and mast was curling around them , causing Alice and Gwenafra to cough . Another warcanoe was approaching swiftly from the north ; the two schooners were sailing close-hauled toward them . They could fight and draw some blood from their enemies , who would be holding themselves back to keep from killing them . Or they could swim for it . Either way , they would be captured . Loghu and de Greystock were pulled aboard . Frigate reportedthat Esther could not be brought back to consciousness.  |p119Ruach  felt her pulse and opened her eyes and then walked back to Burton . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton said , " You women know what will happen to you . It 's up to you , of course , but I suggest you swim down as deeply as you can and draw in a good breath of water . You 'll wake up tomorrow , good as new . " Gwenafra had come out from the fo'c'sle . She wrapped her arms around his waist and looked up , dry-eyed but scared . He hugged her with one arm and then said , " Alice ! Take her with you ! " " Where ? " Alice said . She looked at the canoe and back at him . She coughed again as more smoke wrapped around her and then she moved forward , upwind . " When you go down . " He gestured at The River . " I ca n't do that , " she said . " You would n't want those men to get her , too . She 's only a little girl but they 'll not stop for that . " Alice looked as if her face was going to crumple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep . She said , " Very well . It 's no sin now , killing yourself . I just hope .. . " He said , " Yes . " He did not drawl the word ; there was no time to drawl anything out . The canoe was within forty feet of them . " The next place might be just as bad or worse than this one , " Alice said . " And Gwenafra will wake up all alone . You know that the chances of us being resurrected at the same place are slight . " " That ca n't be helped , " he said . She clamped her lips , then opened them and said , " I 'll fight until the last moment . Then . . . " " It may be too late , " he said . He picked up his bow and drew an arrow from his quiver . De Greystock had lost his bow , so he took Kazz 's . The Neanderthal placed a stone in a sling and began whirling it . Lev picked up his sling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bow , since he had lost his , also . The captain of the canoe shouted in German , " Lay down your arms ! You wo n't be harmed ! " He fell off the platform onto a paddler a second later as Alice 's arrow went through his chest . Another arrow , probably de Greystock 's , spun the second man off the platform and into the water . A stone hit a paddler in the shoulder , and he collapsedwith a cry . Another stone struck glancingly off another paddler 's head , and he lost his paddle . The canoe kept on coming . The two men on the aft platform urged the crew to continue driving toward The Hadji . Then they fell with arrows in them . Burton looked behind him . The two schooners were letting their sails drop now . Evidently they would slide on up to The Hadji where the sailors would throw their grappling hooks into it . But if they got too close , the flames might spread to them . The canoe rammed into The Hadji with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just before the canoe 's prow hit , the survivors dropped their paddles and raised small round leather shields . Even so , two arrows went through two shields and into the arms of the men holding them . That still left twenty men against six men , five women , and a child . But one was a five-foot-high hairy man with tremendous strength and a big stone axe . Kazz jumped into the air just before the canoe rammed the starboard hull and came down in it a second after it had halted . His axe crushed two skulls and then drove through the bottom of the canoe . Water poured in , and de Greystock , shouting something in his Cumberland MiddleEnglish , leaped down beside Ka7z . He held a stiletto in one hand and a big oak club with flint spikes in the other . The others on The Hadji continued to shoot their arrows . Suddenly , Ka77 and de Greystock were scrambling back onto the catamaran and the canoe was sinking with its dead , dying , and its scared survivors . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard The Hadji . These fell back with their forgers chopped off or stamped fiat . Something struck on the deck near him and then something else coiled around him . Burton spun and slashed at the leather rope which had settled around his neck . He leaped to one side to avoid another and yanked savagely at a third rope and pulled the man on the other end over the railing . The man , screaming , pitched out and struck the deck of The Hadji with his shoulder . Burton smashed in his face with his axe . But now men were dropping from the decks of both schooners and ropes were falling everywhere . The smoke and the flames added to the confusion , though they may have helped The Hadji 's crew more than the boarders . Burton shouted at Alice to get Gwenafra and jump into The River . He could not find her and then had to parry the thrust of a big black with a spear . The man seemed to have forgotten any orders to capture Burton ; he looked as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whirled , lashing out as he went by with the axe and smashed its edge against the black 's neck . Burton continued to whirl , felt a sharp pain in his ribs , another in his shoulder , but knocked two men down and then was in the water . He fell between the schooner and The Hadji , went down , released the axe and pulled the stiletto from its sheath . When he came up , he was looking up at a tall , rawboned , redheaded man who was lifting the screaming Gwenafra above him with both hands . The man pitched her far out into the water . Burton dived again and coming up saw Gwenafra 's face only a few feet before him . It was gray , and her eyes were dull . Then he saw the blood darkening the water around her . She disappearedbefore he could get to her . He dived down after her , caught her and pulled her back up . A hornfish tip was stuck into her back . He let her body go . He dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have easily taken her prisoner . Perhaps Alice had stabbed her and the man had figured that she was as good as dead and so had tossed her over the side to the fishes.  |p122A  body shot out of the smoke , followed by another . One man was dead with a broken neck ; the other was alive . Burton wrapped his arm around the man 's neck and stabbed him at the juncture of jaw and ear . The man quit struggling and slipped down into the depths . Frigate leaped out from the smoke , his face and shoulders bloody . He hit the water at a slant and dived deep . Burton swam toward him to help him . There was no use even trying to get back on the craft . It was solid with struggling bodies , and other canoes and dugouts were closing in . Frigate 's head rose out of the water . His skin was white where the blood was not pumping out over it . Burton swam to him and said , " Did the women get away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! " Burton upended to dive down . Something hit his legs ; he kept on going down , but he could not carry out his intention of breathing in the water . He would fight until they had to kill him . On coming up , he saw that the water was alive with men who had jumped in after him and Frigate . The American , half-conscious , was being towed to a canoe . Three men closed in on Burton , and he stabbed two and then a man in a dugout reached down with a club and banged him on the head . They were led ashore near a large building behind a wall of pine logs . Burton 's head throbbed with pain at every step . The gashes in his shoulder and ribs hurt , but they had quit bleeding . The fortress was built of pine logs , had an overhanging second story , and many sentinels . The captives were marched throughp123an entrance that could be closed with a huge log gate . They marched across sixty feet of grass-covered yard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty wide . Except for Frigate , who was too weak , they stood before a large round table of oak . They blinked in the dark and cool interior before they could clearly see the two men at the table . Guards with spears , clubs , and stone axes were everywhere . A wooden staircase at one end of the hall led up to a runway with high railings . Women looked over the railings at them . One of the men at the table was short and muscular . He had a hairy body , black curly hair , a nose like a falcon 's , and brown eyes as fierce as a falcon 's . The second man was taller , had blond hair , eyes the exact color of which was difficult to tell in the dusky light but were probably blue , and a broad Teutonic face . A paunch and the beginnings of jowls told of the food and liquor he had taken from the grails of slaves . Frigate had sat down on the grass , but he was pulled up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the blond and said , " You look like Hermann Goring when he was young . " Then he dropped to his knees , screaming with pain from the impact of a spear butt over his kidneys . The blond spoke in an English with a heavy German accent . " No more of that unless I order it . Let them talk . " He scrutinized them for several minutes , then said , " Yes , I am Hermann Goring . " " Who is Goring ? " Burton said . " Your friend can tell you later , " the German said . " If there is a later for you . I am not angry about the splendid fight you put up . I admire men who can fight well . I can always use more spears , especially since you killed so many . I offer you a choice . You men , that is . Join me and live well with all the food , liquor , tobacco , and women you can possibly want . Or work for me as my slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English . " You forget , Hermann , dat I have yust as muck to say about dis as you . " 124Goring smiled , chuckled , and said , " Of course ! I was only using the royal I , you might say . Very well , we . If you swear to serve us , and it will be far better for you if you do , you will swear loyalty to me , Hermann Goring , and to the one-time king of ancient Rome , Tullius Hostilius . " Burton looked closely at the man . Could he actually be the legendary king of ancient Rome ? Of Rome when it was a small village threatened by the other Italic tribes , the Sabines , Aequi , and Volsci ? Who , in turn , were being pressed by the Umbrians , themselves pushed by the powerful Etruscans ? Was this really Tullius Hostilius , warlike successor to the peaceful Numa Pompilius ? There was nothing to distinguish him from a thousand men whom Burton had seen on the streets of Siena . Yet , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a treasure trove , historicallyand linguistically speaking . He would , since he was probablyEtruscan himself , know that language , in addition to preClassicalLatin , and Sabine , and perhaps Campanian Greek . He might even have been acquainted with Romulus , supposed founder of Roma . What stories that man could tell ! " Well ? " Goring said . " What do we have to do if we join you ? " Burton said . " First , I . . . we . . . have to make sure that you are the caliber of man we want . In other words , a man who will unhesitatinglyand immediately do anything that we order . We will give you a little test . " He gave an order and a minute later , a group of men was brought forward . All were gaunt , and all were crippled . " They were injured while quarrying stone or building our walls , " Goring said . " Except for two caught while trying to escape . They will have to pay the penalty . All will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not hesitate about killing them to show your determination to serve us . " He added , " Besides , they are all Jews . Why worry about them ? " Campbell , the redhead who had thrown Gwenafra into The River , held out to Burton a large club studded with chert blades . Two guards seized a slave and forced him to his knees. 125 ' He was a large blond with blue eyes and a Grecian profile ; he glared at Goring and then spat at him . Goring laughed . " He has all the arrogance of his race . I could reduce him to a quivering screaming mass begging for death if I wanted to . But I do not really care for torture . My compatriot would like to give him a taste of the fire , but I am essentially a humanitarian . " " I will kill in defense of my life or in defense of those who need protection , " Burton said . " But I am not a murderer . " " Killing this Jew would be an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do not , you will die anyway . Only it will take you a long time . " " I will not , " Burton said . Goring sighed . " You English ! Well , I would rather have you on my side . But if you do n't want to do the rational thing , so be it . What about you ? " he said to Frigate . Frigate , who was still in agony , said , " Your ashes ended in a trash heap in Dachau because of what you did and what you were . Are you going to repeat the same criminal acts on this world ? " Goring laughed and said , " I know what happened to me . Enough of my Jewish slaves have told me . " He pointed at Monat . " What kind of a freak is that ? " Burton explained . Goring looked grave , then said , " I could n't trust him . He goes into the slave camp . You , there , apeman . What do you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I kill for you . I do n't want to be slave . " He took the club while the guards held their spears poised to run him through if he had other ideas for using it . He glared at them from under his shelving brows , then raised the club . There was a crack , and the slave pitched forward on the dirt . Kazz returned the club to Campbell and stepped aside . He did not look at Burton . Goring said , " All the slaves will be assembled tonight , and they will be shown what will happen to them if they try to get away . The escapees will be roasted for a while , then put out ofp126their misery . My distinguished colleague will personally handle the club . He likes that sort of thing . " He pointed at Alice . " That one . I 'll take her . " Tullius stood up . " No , no . I like her . You take de oders , Hermann . I giw you bot ' off dem . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , wat you say , aristocrat . A . . . queen ? " Burton roared , snatched a club from Campbell 's hand , and leaped upon the table . Goring fell backward , the tip of the club narrowly missing his nose . At the same time , the Roman thrust a spear at Burton and wounded him in the shoulder . Burton kept hold of the club , whirled , and knocked the weapon out of Tullius ' hand . The slaves , shouting , threw themselves upon the guards . Frigate jerked a spear loose and brought the butt of it against Kazz 's head . Kazz crumpled . Monat kicked a guard in the groin and picked up his spear . Burton did not remember anything after that . He awoke severalhours before dusk . His head hurt worse than before . His ribs and both shoulders were stiff with pain . He was lying on grass in a pine log enclosure with a diameter of about fifty yards . Fifteen feet above the grass , circling the interior of the wall , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he sat up . Frigate , squatting near him , said , " I was afraid you 'd never come out of it . " " Where are the women ? " Burton said . Frigate began to weep . Burton shook his head and said , " Quit blubbering . Where are they ? " " Where the hell do you think they are ? " Frigate said . " Oh , my God ! " " Do n't think about the women . There 's nothing you can do for them . Not now , anyway . Why was n't I killed after I attackedGoring ? " Frigate wiped away the tears and said , " Beats me . Maybe they 're saving you , and me , for the fire . As an example . I wish they had killed us . " " What , so recently gained paradise and wish so soon to losep127it ? " Burton said . He began to laugh but quit because pains speared his head . Burton talked to Robert Spruce , an Englishman born in 1945 in Kensington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goring and Tullius had seized power . For the time being , they were leaving their neighbors in peace . Eventually , of course , they would try to conquer the adjacent territories , including the Onondaga Indians across The River . So far , no slave had escaped to spread word about G  --  ring 's intentions . " But the people on the borders can see for themselves that the walls are being built by slaves , " Burton said . Spruce grinned wryly and said , " Goring has spread the word that these are all Jews , that he is only interested in enslaving Jews . So , what do they care ? As you can see for yourself , that is not true . Half of the slaves are Gentile . " At dusk , Burton , Frigate , Ruach , de Greystock , and Monat were taken from the stockade and marched down to a grailrock . There were about two hundred slaves there , guarded by about seventy Goringites . Their grails were placed on the rock , and they waited . After the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave opened his , and guards removed the tobacco , liquor , and half of the food . Frigate had gashes in his head and in his shoulder which needed sewing up , though the bleeding had stopped . His color had much improved , though his back and kidneys pained him . " So now we 're slaves , " Frigate said . " Dick , you thought quite a lot of the institution of slavery . What do you think of it now ? " " That was Oriental slavery , " Burton said . " In this type of slavery , there 's no chance for a slave to gain his freedom . Nor is there any personal feeling , except hatred , between slave and owner . In the Orient , the situation was different . Of course , like any human institution , it had its abuses . " " You 're a stubborn man , " Frigate said . " Have you noticed that at least half the slaves are Jews ? Late twentieth-century Israeli , most of them . That girl over there told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Semitism inp128this area . Of course , it had to exist before it could be aroused . Then , after he had gotten into power with Tullius ' aid , he enslavedmany of his former supporters . " He continued , " The hell of it is , Goring is not , relatively speaking , a genuine anti-Semite . He personally intervened with Himmler and others to save Jews . But he is something even worse than a genuine Jew-hater . He is an opportunist . AntiSemitismwas a tidal wave in Germany ; to get anyplace , you had to ride the wave . So , Goring rode there , just as he rode here . An anti-Semite such as Goebbels or Frank believed in the principles they professed . Perverted and hateful principles , true , but still principles . Whereas big fat happy-go-lucky Goring did not really care one way or the other about the Jews . He just wanted to use them . " " All very well , " Burton said , " but what has that got to do with me ? Oh , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Dick , I admire you as I have admired few men . I love you as one man loves another . I am as happy and delighted to have had the singular good luck to fall in with you as , say , Plutarch would be if he had met Alcibiades or Theseus . But I am not blind . I know your faults , which are many , and I regret them . " " Just which one is it this time ? " " That book . The Jew , The Gypsy , and El Islam . How could you have written it ? A hate document full of bloody-minded nonsense , folk tales , superstitions ! Ritual murders , indeed ! " " I was still angry because of the injustices I had suffered at Damascus . To be expelled from the consulate because of the lies of my enemies , among whom . . . " " That does n't excuse your writing lies about a whole group , " Frigate said . " Lies ! I wrote the truth ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from an age which definitely knows that they were not . In fact , no one in his right mind in your time would have believed that crap ! " " The facts are , " Burton said , " that the Jewish moneylendersp129in Damascus were charging the poor a thousand percent intereston their loans . The facts are that they were inflicting this monstrous usury not only on the Moslem and Christian populacebut on their own people . The facts are , that when my enemiesin England accused me of anti-Semitism , many Jews in Damascus came to my defense . It is a fact that I protested to the Turks when they sold the synagogue of the Damascan Jews to the Greek Orthodox bishop so he could turn it into a church . It is a fact that I went out and drummed up eighteen Moslems to testify in behalf of the Jews . It is a fact that I protected the Christian missionaries from the Druzes . It is a fact that I warned the Druzes that that fat and oily Turkish swine , Rashid Pasha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacre them . It is a fact that when I was recalled from my consular post , because of the lies of the Christian missionaries and priests , of Rashid Pasha , and of the Jewish usurers , thousands of Christians , Moslems , and Jews rallied to my aid , though it was too late then . " It is also a fact that I do n't have to answer to you or to any man for my actions ! " How like Frigate to bring up such an irrelevant subject at such an inappropriate time . Perhaps he was trying to keep from blaming himself by turning his fear and anger on Burton . Or perhaps he really felt that his hero had failed him . Lev Ruach had been sitting with his head between his hands . He raised his head and said , hollowly , " Welcome to the concentration camp , Burton ! This is your first taste of it . It 's an old tale to me , one I was tired of hearing from the beginning . I was in a Nazi camp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I escaped . In Israel , I was captured by Arabs , and I escaped . " So , now , perhaps I can escape again . But to what ? To anothercamp ? There seems to be no end to them . Man is forever building them and putting the perennial prisoner , the Jew , or what have you , in them . Even here , where we have a fresh start , where all religions , all prejudices , should have been shatteredon the anvil of resurrection , little is changed . " " Shut your mouth , " a man near Ruach said . He had red hairp130so curly it was almost kinky , blue eyes , and a face that might have been handsome if it had not been for his broken nose . He was six feet tall and had a wrestler 's body . " Dov Targoff here , " he said in a crisp Oxford accent . " Late commander in the Israeli Navy . Pay no attention to this man . He 's one of the old-time Jews , a pessimist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall than stand up and fight like a man . " Ruach choked , then said , " You arrogant Sabra ! I fought ; I killed ! And I am not a whiner ! What are you doing now , you brave warrior ? Are n't you a slave as much as the rest of us ? " " It 's the old story , " a woman said . She was tall and darkhairedand probably would have been a beauty if she had not been so gaunt . " The old story . We fight among ourselves while our enemies conquer . Just as we fought when Titus besieged Jerusalem and we killed more of our own people than we did the Romans . Just as . . . " The two men turned against her , and all three argued loudly until a guard began beating them with a stick . Later , through swollen lips , Targoff said , " I ca n't take much of this , much longer . Soon . . . well , that guard is mine to kill . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Targoff would not answer . Shortly before dawn , the slaves were awakened and marched to the grailrock . Again , they were given a modicum of food . After eating , they were split up into groups and marched off to their differing assignments . Burton and Frigate were taken to the northern border . They were put to work with a thousand other slaves , and they toiled naked all day in the sun . Their only rest was when they took their grails to the rock at noon and were fed . Goring meant to build a wall between the mountain and The River ; he also intended to erect a second wall which would run for the full ten-mile length of the lakeshore and a third wall at the southern end . Burton and the others had to dig a deep trench and then pile the dirt taken from the hole into a wall . This was hard work ,  |p131for  they had only stone hoes with which to hack at the ground . Since the roots of the grass formed a thickly tangled complex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated blows . The dirt and roots were scraped up on wooden shovels and tossed onto large bamboo sleds . These were dragged by teams onto the top of the wall , where the dirt was shoveled off to make the wall even higher and thicker . At night , the slaves were herded back into the stockade . Here , most of them fell asleep almost at once . But Targoff , the red-headed Israeli , squatted by Burton . " The grapevine gives a little juice now and then , " he said . " I heard about the fight you and your crew made . I also heard about your refusal to join Goring and his swine . " " What do you hear about my infamous book ? " Burton said . Targoff smiled and said , " I never heard of it until Ruach brought it to my attention . Your actions speak for themselves . Besides , Ruach is very sensitive about such things . Not that you can really blame him after what he went through . But I do not think that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you are . I think you 're a good man , the type we need . So . .. " Days and nights of hard work and short rations followed . Burton learned through the grapevine about the women . Wilfredaand Fatima were in Campbell 's apartment . Loghu was with Tullius . Alice had been kept by Goring for a week , then had been turned over to a lieutenant , a Manfred von Kreyscharft . Rumor was that Goring had complained of her coldness and had wanted to give her to his bodyguards to do with as they pleased . But von Kreyscharft had asked for her . Burton was in agony . He could not endure the mental images of her with Goring and von Kreyscharft . He had to stop these beasts or at least die trying . Late that night , he crawled from the big hut he occupied with twenty-five men into Targoff 's hut and woke him up . " You said you knew that I must be on your side , " he whispered . " When are you going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now that , if you do n't do so at once , Ip132intend to foment a break among my own group and anybody else who will join us . " " Ruach has told me more about you , " Targoff said . " I did n't understand , really , what he was talking about . Could a Jew trust anyone who wrote such a book ? Or could such a man be trusted not to turn on them after the common enemy has been defeated ? " Burton opened his mouth to speak angrily , then closed it . For a moment , he was silent . When he spoke , he did so calmly . " In the first place , my actions on Earth speak louder than any of my printed words . I was the friend and protector of many Jews ; I had many Jewish friends . " " That last statement is always a preface to an attack on the Jews , " Targoff said . " Perhaps . However , even if what Ruach claims were true , the Richard Burton you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived on Earth . I think every man has been changed somewhat by his experience here . If he has n't , he is incapable of change . He would be better off dead . " During the four hundred and seventy-six days that I have lived on this River , I have learned much . I am not incapable of changing my mind . I listened to Ruach and Frigate . I argued frequently and passionately with them . And though I did not want to admit it at the time , I thought much about what they said . " " Jew-hate is something bred into the child , " Targoff said . " It becomes part of the nerve . No act of will can get rid of it , unless it is not very deeply embedded or the will is extraordinarily strong . The bell rings , and Pavlov 's dog salivates . Mention the word Jew , and the nervous system storms the citadel of the mind of the Gentile . Just as the word Arab storms mine . But I have a realistic basis for hating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Burton said . " You will either accept me or reject me . In either case , you know what I will do . " " I accept , " Targoff said . " If you can change your mind , I can change mine . I 've worked with you , eaten bread with you . I likep133to think I 'm a good judge of character . Tell me , if you were planning this , what would you do ? " Targoff listened carefully . At the end of Burton 's explanation , Targoff nodded . " Much like my plan . Now . . . " The next day , shortly after breakfast , several guards came for Burton and Frigate . Targoff looked hard at Burton , who knew what Targoff was thinking . Nothing could be done except to march off to Goring 's " palace . " He was seated in a big wooden chair and smoking a pipe . He asked them to sit down and offered them cigars and wine . " Every once in a while , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my colleagues , who are not overly bright . I like especially to talk with somebody who lived after I died . And to men who were famous in their time . I 've few of eithertype , so far . " " Many of your Israeli prisoners lived after you , " Frigate said . " Ah , the Jews ! " Goring airily waved his pipe . " That is the trouble . They know me too well . They are sullen when I try to talk to them , and too many have tried to kill me for me to feel comfortable around them . Not that I have anything against them . I do n't particularly like Jews , but I had many Jewish friends . .. " Burton reddened . Goring , after sucking on his pipe , continued , " Der Fuehrer was a great man , but he had some idiocies . One of them was his attitude toward Jews . Myself , I cared less . But the Germany of my time was anti-Jewish , and a man must go with the Zeitgeistp134if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Even here , a man can not get away from them . " He chattered on for a while , then asked Frigate many questionsconcerning the fate of his contemporaries and the history of post-war Germany . " If you Americans had had any political sense , you would have declared war on Russia as soon as we surrendered . We would have fought with you against the Bolshevik , and we would have crushed them . " Frigate did not reply . Goring then told several " funny , " very obscene stories . He asked Burton to tell him about the strange experience he had had before being resurrected in the valley . Burton was surprised . Had Goring learned about this from Kazz or was there an informer among the slaves ? He told in full detail everything that had happened between the time he opened his eyes to find himself in the place of floatingbodies to the instant when the man in the aerial canoe pointed the metal tube at him . " The extra-Terrestrial , Monat , has a theory that some beings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he ceased to be an ape . For at least two million years . These superbeings have , in some manner , recorded every cell of every human being that ever lived from the moment of conception , probably , to the moment of death . This seems a staggering concept , but it is no more staggering than the resurrection of all humanity and the reshaping of this planet into one Rivervalley . The recordings may have been made when the recordees were living . Or it may be that these superbeings detected vibrations from the past , just as we on Earth saw the light of stars as they had been a thousand years before . " Monat , however , inclines to the former theory . He does not believe in time travel even in a limited sense . " Monat believes that the X 's stored these recordings . How , he does not know . But this planet was then reshaped for us . It is obviously one great Riverworld . During our journey upRiver , we 've talked to dozens whose descriptions leave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over . One wasp135from far up in the northern hemisphere ; another , far down in the southern . All the descriptions fall together to make a picture of a world that has been reworked into one zigzagging Rivervalley . " The people we talked to were killed or died by accident here and were resurrected again in the areas we happened to be traveling through . Monat says that we resurrectees are still being recorded . And when one of us dies again , the **25;13259;TOOLONG are being placed somewhere  --  maybe under the surface of this planet  --  and played into energy-matter converters . The bodies were reproduced as they were at the moment of death and then the rejuvenating devices restored the sleeping bodies . Probably in that same chamber in which I awoke . After this , the bodies , young and whole again , were recorded and then destroyed . And the recordings were played out again , this time through devices under the ground . Once more , energy-matter converters , probably using the heat of this planet 's molten core as energy , reproduced us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know why they are not resurrected a second time in the same spot where they died . But then I do n't know why all our hairs were shaven off or why men 's facial hairs do n't grow or why men were circumcised and women made virgins again . Or why we were resurrected . For what purpose ? Whoever put us here has not shown up to tell us why . " " The thing is , " Frigate said , " the thing is , we are not the same people we were on Earth . I died . Burton died . You died , Hermann Goring . Everybody died . And we can not be brought back to life ! " Goring sucked on his pipe noisily , stared at Frigate , and then said , " Why not ? I am living again . Do you deny that ? " " Yes ! I do deny that  --  in a sense . You are living . But you are not the Hermann Goring who was born in Marienbad Sanatoriumat Rosenheim in Bavaria on January 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godfather was Dr. Hermann Eppenstein , a Jew converted to Christianity . You are not the Goring who succeeded von Richthofen after his death and con/tinued to lead his fliers against the Allies even after the war ended . You are not the Reichsmarschal of Hitler 's Germany nor the refugee arrested by Lieutenant Jerome N. Shapiro . Eppensteinand Shapiro , hah ! And you are not the Hermann Goring who took his life by swallowing potassium cyanide during his trial for his crimes against humanity ! " Goring tamped his pipe with tobacco and said , mildly , " You certainly know much about me . I should be flattered , I suppose . At least , I was not forgotten . " " Generally , you were , " Frigate said . " You did have a longlivedreputation as a sinister clown , a failure , and a toady . " Burton was surprised . He had not known that the fellow would stand up to someone who had power of life and death over him or who had treated him so painfully . But then perhaps Frigate hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Goring 's curiosity . Goring said , " Explain your statement . Not about my reputation . Every man of importance expects to be reviled and misunderstoodby the brainless masses . Explain why I am not the same man . " Frigate smiled slightly and said , " You are the product , the hybrid , of a recording and an energy-matter converter . You were made with all the memories of the dead man Hermann Goring and with every cell of his body a duplicate . You have everything he had . So you think you are Goring . But you are not ! You are a duplication , and that is all ! The original HermannGoring is nothing but molecules that have been absorbed into the soil and the air and so into plants and back into the flesh of beasts and men and out again as excrement , and so welter ! " But you , here before me , are not the original , any more than the recording on a disc or a tape is the original voice , the vibrations issuing from the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device and then replayed . " Burton understood the reference , since he had seen an Edison phonograph in Paris in 1888 . He felt outraged , actually violated , at Frigate 's assertions.  |p137Goring  's wide-open eyes and reddening face indicated that he , too , felt threatened down to the core of his being . After stuttering , Goring said , " And why would these beings go to all this trouble just to make duplicates ? " Frigate shrugged and said , " I do n't know . " Goring heaved up from his chair and pointed the stem of his pipe at Frigate . " You lie ! " he screamed in German . " You lie , scheisshundl " Frigate quivered as if he expected to be struck over the kidneysagain , but he said , " I must be right . Of course , you do n't have to believe what I say . I ca n't prove anything . And I understandexactly how you feel . I know that I am Peter Jairus Frigate , born 1918 , died 2008 A.D. But I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am only , really , a being who has the memories of that Frigate who will never rise from the dead . In a sense , I am the son of that Frigate who can never exist again . Not flesh of his flesh , blood of his blood , but mind of his mind . I am not the man who was born of a woman on that lost world of Earth . I am the byblow of science and a machine . Unless ... " Goring said , " Yes ? Unless what ? " " Unless there is some entity attached to the human body , an entity which is the human being . I mean , it contains all that makes the individual what he is , and when the body is destroyed , this entity still exists . So that , if the body were to be made again , this entity , storing the essence of the individual , could be attached again to the body . And it would record everythingthat the body recorded . And so the original individual would live again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " For God 's sake , Pete ! Are you proposing the soul ? " Frigate nodded and said , " Something analagous to the soul . Something that the primitives dimly apprehended and called a soul . " Goring laughed uproariously . Burton would have laughed , but he did not care to give Goring any support , moral or intellectual.  |p138When  Goring had quit laughing , he said , " Even here , in a world which is clearly the result of science , the supernaturalists wo n't quit trying . Well , enough of that . To more practical and immediate matters . Tell me , have you changed your mind ? Are you ready to join me ? " Burton glared and said , " I would not be under the orders of a man who rapes women ; moreover , I respect the Israelis . I would rather be a slave with them than free with you . " Goring scowled and said , harshly , " Very well . I thought as much . But I had hoped . . . well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets his way , you will see how merciful I have been to you slaves . You do not know him . Only my interventionhas saved one of you being tortured to death every night for his amusement . " At noon , the two returned to their work in the hills . Neither got a chance to speak to Targoff or any of the slaves , since their duties happened not to bring them into contact . They did not dare make an open attempt to talk to him , because that would have meant a severe beating . After they returned to the stockade in the evening , Burton told the others what had happened . " More than likely Targoff will not believe my story . He 'll think we 're spies . Even if he 's not certain , he ca n't afford to take chances . So there 'll be trouble . It 's too bad that this had to happen . The escape plan will have to be cancelled for tonight . " Nothing untoward took place  --  at first . The Israelis walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . The stars came out , and the stockade was flooded with a light almost as bright as a full moon on Earth . The prisoners stayed inside their barracks , but they talked in low voices with their heads together . Despite their deep tiredness , they could not sleep . The guards must have sensed the tension , even though they could not see or hear the men in the huts . They walked back and forth on the walks , stood togethertalking , and peered down into the enclosure by the light of the night sky and the flames of the resin torches . " Targoff will do nothing until it rains , " Burton said . He gavep139orders . Frigate was to stand first watch ; Robert Spruce , the second ; Burton , third . Burton lay down on his pile of leaves and , ignoring the murmuring of voices and the moving around of bodies , fell asleep . It seemed that he had just closed his eyes when Spruce touched him . He rose quickly to his feet , yawned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes , the first of the clouds formed . In ten minutes , the stars were blotted out . Thunder grumbled way up in the mountains , and the first lightning flash forked the sky . Lightning struck near . Burton saw by its flash that the guards were huddled under the roofs sticking out from the base of the watch houses at each corner of the stockade . They were covered with towels against the chill and the rain . Burton crawled from his barracks to the next . Targoff was standing inside the entrance . Burton stood up and said , " Does the plan still hold ? " " You know better than that , " Targoff said . A bolt of lightningshowed his angry face . " You Judas ! " He stepped forward , and a dozen men followed him . Burton did not wait ; he attacked . But , as he rushed forward , he heard a strange sound . He paused to look out through the door . Anotherflash revealed a guard sprawled face down in the grass beneath a walk . Targoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . He said , " What 's going on , Burton ? " " Wait , " the Englishman replied . He had no more idea than the Israeli about what was happening , but anything unexpected could be to his advantage . Lightning illuminated the squat figure of Kazz on the wooden walk . He was swinging a huge stone axe against a group of guards who were in the angle formed by the meeting of the two walls . Another flash . The guards were sprawled out on the walk . Darkness . At the next blaze of light , another was down ; the remaining two were running away down the walk in different directions . Another bolt very near the wall showed that , finally , thep140other guards were aware of what was happening . They ran down the walk , shouting and waving their spears . Kazz , ignoring them , slid a long bamboo ladder down into the enclosure and then he threw a bundle of spears after it . By the next flash , he could be seen advancing toward the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder . The others , including the Israeli , were behind him . The fight was bloody and brief . With the guards on the walk either stabbed or hurled to their deaths , only those in the watch houses remained . The ladder was carried to the other end of the stockade and placed against the gate . In two minutes , men had climbed to the outside , dropped down , and opened the gate . For the first time , Burton found the chance to talk to Kazz . " I thought you had sold us out . " " No . Not me , Kazz , " Kazz said reproachfully . " You know I love you , Burton-naq . You 're my friend , my chief . I pretend to join your enemies because that 's playing it smart . I surprise you do n't do the same . You 're no dummy . " " Certainly , you are n't , " Burton said . " But I could n't bring myself to kill those slaves . " Lightning revealed Kazz shrugging . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know them . Besides , you hear Goring . He say they die anyway . " " It 's a good thing you chose tonight to rescue us , " Burton said . He did not tell Kazz why since he did not want to confuse him . Moreover , there were more important things to do . " Tonight 's a good night for this , " Kazz said . " Big battle going on . Tullius and Goring get very drunk and quarrel . They fight ; their men fight . While they kill each other , invaders come . Those brown men across The River . . . what you call them ? ... Onondagas , that 's them . Their boats come just before rain come . They make raid to steal slaves , too . Or maybe just for the hell of it . So , I think , now 's good time to start my plan , get Burton-naq free . " As suddenly as it had come , the rain ceased . Burton could hear shouts and screams from far off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riverbanks . He said to Targoff , " We can either try to escape , and probably do so easily , or we can attack . " " I intend to wipe out the beasts who enslaved us , " Targoff said . " There are other stockades nearby . I 've sent men to open their gates . The rest are too far away to reach quickly ; they 're strung out at half-mile intervals . " By then , the blockhouse in which the off-duty guards lived had been stormed . The slaves armed themselves and then started toward the noise of the conflict . Burton 's group was on the right flank . They had not gone half a mile before they came upon corpses and wounded , a mixture of Onondagas and whites . Despite the heavy rain , a fire had broken out . By its increasinglight , they saw that the flames came from the longhouse . Outlined in the glare were struggling figures . The escapees advancedacross the plain . Suddenly , one side broke and ran toward them with the victors , whooping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frigate said . " His fat is n't going to help him get away , that 's for sure . " He pointed , and Burton could see the German desperately pumping his legs but falling behind the others . " I do n't want the Indians to have the honor of killing him , " Burton said . " We owe it to Alice to get him . " Campbell 's long-legged figure was ahead of them all , and it was toward him that Burton threw his spear . To the Scot , the missile must have seemed to come out of the darkness from nowhere . Too late , he tried to dodge . The flint head buried itself in the flesh between his left shoulder and chest , and he fell on his side . He tried to get up a moment afterward , but he was kicked back down by Burton . Campbell 's eyes rolled ; blood trickled from his mouth . He pointed at another wound , a deep gash in his side just below the ribs . " You . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , " he gasped . " But I killed her , the bitch . . . " Burton wanted to ask him where Alice was , but Kazz ,
