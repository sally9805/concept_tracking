txt President Carter will use every publicity and political device at his command to gain American acceptance of the second strategic arms limitation agreement ( SALT ) with the Soviet Union , now close to being signed . Mr. Carter believes world peace hinges on a continuing dialogue with Moscow and , to avoid a treaty veto by 34 senators , he would even consider bypassing the Senate by the route of an executive agreement which requires only a Senate majority , plus a majority vote of the House . However , this course would likely only be pursued as a last resort . In the Soviet Union , Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko has detailed his meeting at the White House Sept. 30 , where the President told him he was " confident that in the end Congress would approve " the agreement . Some progress was made at the latest meeting , Mr. Gromyko said , but not final settlement . President Carter already is talking about SALT III ; he sees a Middle East accord and a possiblenormalization of relations with China as two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Panama Canal treaties . Conservative resistance to SALT II , however , already has surfaced . It has begun before the final details are drafted , and there is the potential , some think , for a major , emotional , " soft-on-communism " revival in American politics aimed at Mr. Carter . Many observers here believe Mr. Carter could not make a political end-run around the Senate 's treaty veto power without the kind of ratification battle that met , and killed , the Versailles Treaty after World War I and set the tone of politics for a generation . When the final effort to muster two-thirds for the Versailles Treaty failed in March 19 , 1920 , it meant the end of U.S. efforts to join the League of Nations . Some felt it helped bring on World War II . Ironically , at all times the Senate had a majority for some sort of a Versailles treaty but not two-thirds for any particular formula . To promote the treaty , Woodrow Wilson made an unsuccessful whistle-stop tour across America and suffered a physical collapse from which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push for SALT ratification One scenario for Mr. Carter 's drive for ratification of SALT II goes like this . Final agreement on the treaty would come shortly , followed by a visit by Soviet leader Leonid A. Brezhnev . With maximum fanfare Messrs . Carter and Brez/mev would sign the treaty . This might come as soon as Dec. 1 . Mr. Carter would explain the treaty to . the nation by fireside talks and by all presidential publicity means . The new Congress would take up the treaty . Under the Constitution , one-third of the Senate , 34 member out of a Congress of 535 , can reject it . Mr. Carter bases his expectations for ratification next year on hope of nonpartisan support from middle-of-the-road Republicans . Former President Gerald R. Ford and ex-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger backed ratification of the Panama Canal treaties . Mr. Carter called the Panama fight the hardest in his career , including that for his election . A violent attack seems brewing against the treaty from hard-liners like former California Gov . Ronald Reagan ; Paul H. Nitze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ) of Washington ; and anti-treaty organizations like the Committee on the Present Danger . Unlike Woodrow Wilson , Mr. Carter can reach America overnight . Treaty details are too complex for the average man to understand , it is felt , and the battle will turn on the faith of the man in the street in the judgment of the President . Senate rejection of the SALT treaty , State Department officials say , could be " calamitous . " In 1898 , when the Senate rejected treaty acquisition of Hawaii , Congress passed a joint resolution by majority in both Houses , and Hawaii was annexed . Franklin D. Roosevelt 's agreement with Britain in 1940 to swap destroyers for bases was made by executive order , not treaty . The number of executive agreements in international affairs has grown steadily , to gel around the two-thirds vote of the Senate provision put in the Constitution by its framers , who expected the U.S. Senate to be an upper-class elite . There were 9 in 1930 , 266 in 1968 , and 4,359 in 1972 . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
