Two years ago , the athletic director at Julia Barash 's high school in Monroe , N.Y. , refused to let her try out for the school 's varsity tennis team-an all-male squad . His shaky ground : state regulations say that girls just do n't compete with boys . Julia appealed to the state education department . Advised by counsel that Julia would win a court case in straight sets , the department defaulted . She promptly became Monroe 's top player and pulled the team out of the cellar into a tie for first place . <P> To convince diehard objectors , state officials launched a re-examination of the traditional notion that " it is not yet socially acceptable for a girl to defeat a boy . " Now the results are in and varsity sexism is on the way out . More than 100 New York high schools accepted the department 's delicate invitation to test girls as competitors in " noncontact " sports like tennis , golf , bowling , riflery , swimming and track . Neither boys , coaches , parents nor girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the sexes seemed to play extra hard to outdo each other . As a result , the state 's board of regents is being asked to allow such integration all over the state , though not in football and other mauling sports . As for Julia , she is now a tennis star at Cornell-on the women 's team .
