CONVERSATION IN THE CATHEDRAL by MARIO VARGAS LLOSA Translated by GREGORY RABASSA 601 pages . Harper &; Row . $12.50 . <P> <P> While the American novel is still growing warts worrying about which direction to take , The Other American Novel confidently barrels on oblivious to paper shortages and critical advisories that less is more . Throughout Central and South America , writers still seem willing to tackle the long , complex novel of politics , society and class . Open to most literary influences and rarely shy about blending them , Latin American authors frequently give the impression that they are catering a novel rather than composing one . There are exceptions . Argentina 's Jorges Luis Borges , for example , builds exquisite doll houses from bits of literary history , fantasy and skeptical philosophy . He has become , not surprisingly , one of the major influences on contemporary U.S. fiction . But the Latin appetite for the big bite has in recent years produced one unquestionable masterpiece : in One Hundred Years of Solitude , Colombia 's Gabriel Garcia Marquez completely and gloriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Brutal Naturalism . If Garcia Marquez is Latin America 's Faulkner , Peru 's Mario Vargas Llosa is aesthetically , if not stylistically , its Dreiser . His first novel , The City of the Dogs , was a brutal slab of naturalism about life and violent death at a Peruvian military school for problem youth-a place not unlike the institution Vargas Llosa attended in the early 1950s . Officials at the school ensured the author a wide readership and international attention by publicly burning 1,000 copies of his book . <P> Vargas Llosa 's second novel , The Green House , was respectfully roasted by some critics for its chaotic form , thematic dead ends and lock-step fatalism . There remained , however , the author 's undeniable ability to generate powerful atmospheres within his remorseless , self-imposed boundaries . <P> The same judgments apply to Conversation in the Cathedral , a long , layered tale about indolence , greed , violence , corruption , sexual perversion and general animal cunning in modern Peru . The novel is a vortex of determinism driven by one central question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , " had Peru-itself up ? " <P> The answer is not forthcoming , but the question pervades everything and everyone as surely as Lima 's chilly mists . <P> The book is a chronicle of botched hopes and personal failures . The government sinks in corruption and ineptitude . Idealistic university students stumble over their ignorance and lack of discipline . A servant girl 's brief moment of romance leads to jungle rot and death in childbirth . Cynical political hacks are failed Communists and newspapermen are often failed poets who have difficulty with the fundamentals of news writing . " You have to start with the dead people , young man , " advises one helpful editor . The novel 's title does not refer to the church , which the author oddly does not deal with , but to a Lima bar and brothel called the Cathedral .
