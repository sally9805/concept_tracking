precious penny of my own and hide it for someone else to find . It was a curious compulsion ; sadly , I 've never been seized by it since . For some reason I always " hid " the penny along the same stretch of sidewalk up the street . I 'd cradle it at the roots of a maple , say , or in a hole left by a chipped-off piece of sidewalk . Then I 'd take a piece of chalk and , starting at either end of the block , draw huge arrows leading up to the penny from both directions . After I learned to write labeled the arrows " SURPRISE AHEAD " or " MONEY THIS WAY . " I was greatly excited , during all this arrow-drawing , at the thought of the first lucky passerby who would receive in this way , regardless of merit , a free gift from the universe . But I never lurked about . I 'd go straight home and not give the matter another thought , until , some months later , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are lots of things to see , unwrapped gifts and free surprises . The world is fairly tudded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand . But ? and this is the point ? who gets excited by a mere penny ? If you follow one arrow , if you crouch motionless 3n a bank to watch a tremulous ripple thrill on : he water . and are rewarded by the sight of a muskrat kit paddling from its den , will you - ount that sight a chip of copper only , and go your rueful way ? It is very dire poverty indeed or a man to be so malnourished and fatigued hat he wo n't stoop to pick up a penny . But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity . , o that finding a penny will make your day . hen , since the world is in fact planted in pen-lies , you have with your poverty bought a lifeime of days . What you see is what you get . Unfortunately , nature is very much a now'ou-see-it , now-you-do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water before my eyes like so much salt . Deer apparently ascend bodily into heaven ; the brightest oriole fades into leaves . These disappearances stun me into stillness and concentration ; they say of nature that it conceals with a grand nonchalance , and they say of vision that it is a deliberate gift , the revelation of a dancer who for my eyes only flings away her seven veils . For nature does reveal as well as conceal : now-you-don't-see-it , now-you-do . For a week this September migrating red-winged blackbirds were feeding heavily down by Tinker Creek at the back of the house . One day I went out to investigate the racket ; I walked up to a tree , an Osage orange , and a hundred birds flew away . They simply materialized out of the tree . I saw a tree , then a whisk of color , then a tree again . I walked closer and another hundred blackbirds took flight . Not a branch , not a twig budged : the birds were apparently weightless as well as invisible . Or , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been freed from a spell in the form of red-winged blackbirds ; they flew from the tree , caught my eye in the sky , and vanished . When I looked again at the tree , the leaves had reassembled as if nothing had happened . Finally I walked directly to the trunk of the tree and a final hundred , the real diehards , appeared , spread , and vanished . How could so many hide in the tree without my seeing them ? The Osage orange , unruffled , looked just as it had looked from the house , when three hundred red-winged blackbirds cried from its crown . I looked upstream where they flew , and they were gone . Searching , I could n't spot one . I wandered upstream to force them to play their hand . but they 'd crossed the creek and scattered . One show to a customer . These appearances catch at my throat ; they are the free gifts , the bright coppers at the roots of trees . 39 I T 'S ALL A MATTER OF keeping my eyes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are puzzles for children : Can you find hidden in the tree a duck , a house , a boy , a bucket , a giraffe , and a boot ? Specialists can find the most incredibly hidden things . A book I read when I was young recommended an easy way to find caterpillars : you simply find some fresh caterpillar droppings , look up , and there 's your caterpillar . More recently an author advised me to set my mind at ease about those piles of cut stems on the ground in grassy fields . Field mice make them ; they cut the grass down by degrees to reach the seeds at the head . It seems that when the grass is tightly packed , as in a field of ripe grain , the blade wo n't topple at a single cut through the stem ; instead , the cut stem simply drops vertically , held in the crush of grain . The mouse severs the bottom again and again , the stem keeps dropping an inch at a time , and finally the head is low enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse is positively littering the field with its little piles of cut stems into which , presumably , the author is constantly stumbling . If I ca n't see these minutiae , I still try to keep my eyes open . I 'm always on the lookout for ant lion traps in sandy soil , monarch pupae near milkweed , skipper larvae in locust leaves . These things are utterly common , and I 've not seen one . I bang on hollow trees near water , but so far no flying squirrels have appeared . In flat country I watch every sunset in hopes of seeing the green ray . The green ray is a seldom-seen streak of light that rises from the sun like a spurting fountain at the moment of sunset ; it throbs into the sky for two seconds and disappears . One more reason to keep my eyes open . A photography professor at the University of Florida just happened to see a bird die in mid-flight ; it jerked , died , dropped , and smashed on the ground . I squint at the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always maintained that if you looked closely enough you could see the wind ? the dim , hardly-made-out , fine debris fleeing high in the air . " White was an excellent observer , and devoted an entire chapter of The Mountains to the subject of seeing deer : " As soon as you can forget the naturally obvious and construct an artificial obvious , then you too will see deer . " But the artificial obvious is hard to see . My eyes account for less than 1 percent of the weight of my head ; I 'm bony and dense ; I see what I expect . I just do n't know what the lover knows ; I ca n't see the artificial obvious that those in the know construct . The herpetologist asks the native , " Are there snakes in that ravine ? " " No , sir . " And the herpetologist comes home with , yessir , three bags full . Are there butterflies on that mountain ? Are the bluets in bloom ? Are there arrowheads here , or fossil ferns in the shale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only about 30 percent of the light that comes from the sun ; the rest is infrared and some little ultraviolet , perfectly apparent to many animals , but invisible to me . A nightmare network of ganglia , charged and firing without my knowledge , cuts and splices what I do see , editing it for my brain . Donald E. Carr points out that the sense impressions of one-celled animals are not edited for the brain : " This is philosophically interesting in a rather mournful way , since it means that only the simplest animals perceive the universe as it is . " A fog that wo n't burn away drifts and flows across my field of vision . When you see fog move against a backdrop of deep pines , you do n't see the fog itself , but streaks of clearness floating across the air in dark shreds . So I see only tatters of clearness through a pervading obscurity . I ca n't distinguish the fog from the overcast sky ; I ca n't be sure if the light is direct or reflected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We estimate now that only one atom dances alone in every cubic meter of intergalactic space . I blink and squint . What planet or power yanks Halley 's Comet out of orbit ? We have n't seen it yet ; it 's a question of distance , density , and the pallor of reflected light . We rock , cradled in the swaddling band of darkness . Even the simple darkness of night whispers suggestions to the mind . This summer , in August , I stayed at the creek too late . Strangers to darkness WV HERE TINKER CREEK FLOWS under the sycamore log bridge to the tear-shaped island , it is slow and shallow , fringed thinly in cattail marsh . At this spot an astonishing bloom of life supports vast breeding populations of insects , fish , reptiles , birds , and mammals . On windless summer evenings I stalk along the creek bank or straddle the sycamore log in absolute stillness , watching for muskrats . The night I stayed too late I was hunched on the log staring spellbound at spreading , reflected stains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly lighted as if turned on by a switch ; its reflection just as suddenly materialized on the water upstream , flat and floating , so that I could n't see the creek bottom , or life in the water under the cloud . Downstream , away from the cloud on the water , water turtles smooth as beans were gliding down with the current in a series of easy , weightless push-offs , as men bound on the moon . I did n't know whether to trace the progress of one turtle I was sure of , risking sticking my face in one of the bridge 's spider webs made invisible by the gathering dark , or take a chance on seeing the carp , or scan the mudbank in hope of seeing a muskrat , or follow the last of the swallows who caught at my heart and trailed it after them like streamers as they appeared from directly below , under the log , flying upstream with their tails forked , so fast . But shadows spread and deepened and stayed . After thousands of years we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp with our arms crossed over our chests . I stirred . A land turtle on the bank , startled , hissed the air from its lungs and withdrew to its shell . An uneasy pink here , an unfathomable blue there , gave great suggestion of lurking beings . Things were going on . I could n't see whether that rustle I heard was a distant rattlesnake , slit-eyed , or a nearby sparrow kicking in the dry flood debris slung at the foot of a willow . Tremendous action roiled the water everywhere I looked , big action , inexplicable . A tremor welled up beside a gaping muskrat burrow in the bank and I caught my breath , but no muskrat appeared . The ripples continued to fan upstream with a steady , powerful thrust . Night was knitting an eyeless mask over my face , and I still sat transfixed . A distant airplane , a delta wing out of nightmare , made a gliding shadow on the creek 's bottom that looked like a stingray cruising upstream . At once a black fin slit the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two halves merged together and seemed to dissolve before my eyes . Darkness pooled in the cleft of the creek and rose , as water collects in a well . Untamed , dreaming lights flickered over the sky . I saw hints of hulking underwater shadows , two pale splashes out of the water , and round ripples rolling close together from a blackened center . At last I stared upstream where only the deepest violet remained of the cloud , a cloud so high its underbelly still glowed , its feeble color reflected from a hidden sky lighted in turn by a sun halfway to China . And out of that violet , a sudden enormous black body arced over the water . Head and tail , if there was a head and tail , were both submerged in cloud . I saw only one ebony fling , a headlong dive to darkness ; then the waters closed , and the lights went out . I walked home in a shivering daze , up hill and down . Later I lay openmouthed in bed , my arms flung wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latitude I 'm spinning 836 miles an hour round the earth 's axis ; I feel my sweeping fall as a breakneck arc like the dive of dolphins , and the hollow rushing of wind raises the hairs on my neck and the side of my face . In orbit around the sun I 'm moving 64,800 miles an hour . The solar system as a whole , like a merry-go-round unhinged , spins , bobs , and blinks at the speed of 43,200 miles an hour along a course set east of Hercules . Someone has piped , and we are dancing a tarantella untilthe sweat pours . I open my eyes and I see dark , muscled forms curl out of water , with flapping gills and flattened eyes . I close my eyes and I see stars , deep stars giving way to deeper stars , deeper stars bowing to deepest stars at the crown of an infinite cone . " TILL , " WROTE VAN GOGH in a letter , " a L great deal of light falls on everything . " If we are blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes here in Virginia at sunset low clouds on the southern or northern horizon are completely invisible in the lighted sky . I only know one is there because I can see its reflection in still water . The first time I discovered this mystery I looked from cloud to no-cloud in bewilderment , checking my bearings over and over , thinking maybe the ark of the covenant was just passing by south of Dead Man Mountain . Only much later did I learn the explanation : polarized light from the sky is very much weakened by reflection , but the light in clouds is n't polarized . So invisible clouds pass among visible clouds , till all slide over the mountains ; so a greater light extinguishes a lesser as though it did n't exist . In the great meteor shower of August , the Perseid , I wail all day for the shooting stars I miss . They 're out there showering down , committing hara-kiri in a flame of fatal attraction , and hissing perhaps at last into the ocean . But at dawn what looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot . The stars and planets could smash and I 'd never know . Only a piece of ashen moon occasionally climbs up or down the inside of the dome , and our local star without surcease explodes on our heads . We have really only that one light , one source for all power , and yet we must turn away from it by universal decree . Nobody here on the planet seems aware of this strange , powerful taboo , that we all walk about carefully averting our faces , this way and that , lest our eyes be blasted forever . Darkness appalls and light dazzles ; the scrap of visible light that does n't hurt my eyes hurts my brain . What I see sets me swaying . Size and distance and the sudden swelling of meanings confuse me , bowl me over . I straddle the sycamore log bridge over Tinker Creek in the summer . I look at the lighted creek bottom : snail tracks tunnel the mud in quavering curves . A crayfish jerks , but by the time I absorb what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silt . I look at the water : minnows and shiners . If I 'm thinking minnows , a carp will fill my brain till I scream . I look at the water'E surface : skaters , bubbles , and leaves sliding down . Suddenly , my own face , reflected , startles me witless . Those snails have been tracking m3 face ! Finally , with a shuddering wrench of du will , I see clouds , cirrus clouds . I 'm dizzy , I fall in . This looking business is risky . Once I stood on a humped rock on nearby Purgatory Mountain , watching through binoculars the great autumn hawk migration below , until I discovered that I was in danger of joining the hawks on a vertical migration of my own . I was used to binoculars , but not , apparently , to balancing on humped rocks while looking through them . I reeled . Everything advanced and receded by turns ; the world was full of unexplained fore-shortenings and depths . A distant huge object , a hawk the size of an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby loblolly pine . I followed a sharp-shinned hawk against a featureless sky , rotating my head unawares as it flew , and when I lowered the glass a glimpse of my own looming shoulder sent me staggering . What prevents the men on Palomar from falling , voiceless and blinded , from their tiny , vaulted chairs ? I reel in confusion ; I do n't understand what I see . With the naked eye 1 can see two million light-years to the Andromeda galaxy . Often I slop some creek water in a jar , and when I get home I dump it in a white china bowl . After the silt settles I return and see tracings of minute snails on the bottom , a planarian or two winding round the rim of water , roundworms shimmying frantically , and finally , when my eyes have adjusted to these dimensions , amoebae . At first the amoebae look like muscae volitantes , those curled moving spots you seem to see in your eyes when you stare at a distant wall . Then I see the amoebae as drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sky in the bowl . At length I choose one individual and give myself over to its idea of an evening . I see it dribble a grainy foot before it on its wet , unfathomable way . Do its unedited sense impressions include the fierce focus of my eyes ? Shall I take it outside and show it Andromeda , and blow its little endoplasm ? I stir the water with a finger , in case it 's running out of oxygen . Maybe I should get a tropical aquarium with motorized bubblers and lights , and keep this one for a pet . Yes , it would tell its fissioned descendants , the universe is two feet by five , and if you listen closely you can hear the buzzing music of the spheres . Oh , it 's mysterious , lamplit evenings here in the galaxy , one after the other . It 's one of those nights when I wander from window to window , looking for a sign . But I ca n't see . Terror and a beauty insoluble are a riband of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small . No culture explains , no bivouac offers real haven or rest . But it could be that we are not seeing something . Galileo thought comets were an optical illusion . This is fertile ground : since we are certain that they 're not , we can look at what our scientistshave been saying with fresh hope . What if there are really gleaming , castellated cities hung upside-down over the desert sand ? What limpid lakes and cool date palms have our caravans always passed untried ? Until , one by one , by the blindest of leaps , we light on the road to these places , we must stumble in darkness and hunger . I turn from the window . I 'm blind as a bat , sensing only from every direction the echo of my own thin cries . Learning to see CHANCED ON A WONDERFUL BOOK called I Space and Sight , by Marius Von Senden . When Western surgeons discovered how to perform safe cataract operations , they ranged across Europe and America operating on dozens of men and women of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von Senden collected accounts of such cases ; the histories are fascinating . Many doctors had tested their patients ' sense perceptions and ideas of space both before and after the operations . The vast majority of patients , of both sexes and all ages , had , in Von Senden 's opinion , no idea of space whatsoever . Form , distance , and size were so many meaningless syllables . A patient " had no idea of depth , confusing it with roundness . " Before the operation a doctor would give a blind patient a cube and a sphere ; the patient would tongue it or feel it with his hands , and name it correctly . After the operation the doctor would show the same objects to the patient without letting him touch them ; now he had no clue whatsoever to what he was seeing . One patient called lemonade " square " because it pricked on his tongue as a square shape pricked on the touch of his hands . Of another postoperative patient the doctor writes , " I have found in her no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow limits which she might have encompassed with the aid of touch . Thus when I asked her to show me how big her mother was , she did not stretch out her hands , but set her two index fingers a few inches apart . " For the newly sighted , vision is pure sensation unencumbered by meaning . When a newly sighted girl saw photographs and paintings , she asked , " ' Why do they put those dark marks all over them ? ' Those are n't dark marks , ' her mother explained , ' those are shadows . That is one of the ways the eye knows that things have shape . If it were not for shadows , many things would look flat . ' Well , that 's how things do look , ' Joan answered . ' Everything looks flat with dark patches . ' " In general the newly sighted see the world as a dazzle of " color-patches . " They are pleased by the sensation of color , and learn quickly to name the colors , but the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his operation a patient " generally bumps into one of these colour-patches and observes them to be substantial , since they resist him as tactual objects do . In walking about it also strikes him ? or can if he pays attention ? that he is continually passing in between the colours he sees , that he can go past a visual object , that a part of it then steadily disappears from view ; and that in spite of this , however he twists and turns ? whether entering the room from the door , for example , or returning back to it ? he always has a visual space in front of him . Thus he gradually comes to realize that there is also a space behind him , which he does not see . " The mental effort involved in these reasonings proves overwhelming for many patients . It oppresses them to realize , if they ever do at all , the tremendous size of the world , which they had previously conceived of as something touchingly manageable . It oppresses them to realize that they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without their knowledge or consent . A disheartening number of them refuse to use their new vision , continuing to go over objects with their tongues , and lapsing into apathy and despair . On the other hand , many newly sighted people speak well of the world , and teach us how dull our own vision is . To one patient , a human hand , unrecognized , is " something bright and then holes . " Shown a bunch of grapes , a boy calls out , " It is dark , blue and shiny .... It is n't smooth , it has bumps and hollows . " A little girl visits a garden . " She is greatly astonished , and : an scarcely be persuaded to answer , stands - ipeechIess in front of the tree , which she only lames on taking hold of it , and then as ' the tree , vith the lights in it ' " Another patient , a tweny-two-year-old girl , was dazzled by the world 's n-ightness and kept her eyes shut for two weeks . When at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not recognize any objects , ' ut " the more she now directed her gaze upon verything about her , the more it could be seen low an expression of gratification and astonishaent overspread her features ; she repeatedly xclaimed : ' Oh God ! How beautiful ! ' " r SAW COLOR-PATCHES FOR WEEKS after I read this wonderful book . It was summer ; the caches were ripe in the valley orchards . When woke in the morning , color-patches wrapped mnd my eyes , intricately , leaving not one untied spot . All day long I walked among shifttg color-patches that parted before me like the ed Sea and closed again in silence , transfigred , wherever I looked back . Some patches yelled and loomed , while others vanished utrly , and dark marks flitted at random over the hole dazzling sweep . But I could n't sustain the illusion of flatness . I 've been around for too long . Form is condemned to an eternal danse macabre with meaning : I could n't unpeach the peaches . Nor can I remember ever having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My brain then must have been smooth as any balloon . Um told I reached for the moon ; many babies do . But the color-patches of infancy swelled as meaning filled them ; they arrayed themselves in solemn ranks down distance which unrolled and stretched before me like a plain . The moon rocketed away . I live now in a world of shadows that shape and distance color , a world where space makes a kind of terrible sense . What Gnosticism is this , and what physics ? The fluttering patch I saw in my nursery window ? silver and green and shape-shifting blue ? is gone ; a row of Lombardy poplars takes its place , mute , across the distant lawn . That humming oblong creature pale as light that stole along the walls of my room at night , stretch . ing exhilaratingly around the corners , is gone , too , gone the night I ate of the bittersweet fruit , put two and two together and puckered forever my brain . Martin Buber tells this tale : " Rabbi Mendel once boasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel who rolls away the light before the darkness , and mornings the angel who rolls away the darkness before the light . ' Yes , ' said Rabbi Elimelekh , ' in my youth I saw that too . Later on you do n't see these things anymore . ' " Why did n't someone hand those newly sighted people paints and brushes from the start , when they still did n't know what anything was ? Then maybe we all could see color-patches too , the world unraveled from reason , Eden before Adam gave names . The scales would drop from my eyes ; I 'd see trees like men walking ; I 'd run down the road against all orders , hallooing and leaping . Silver flashes S EEING IS OF COURSE VERY MUCH a matter of verbalization . Unless I call my attention to what passes before my eyes , I simply wo n't see it . If Tinker Mountain erupted , I 'd be likely to notice . But if I want to notice the lesser cataclysms of valley life , I have to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not that I 'm observant ; it 's just that I talk too much . Otherwise , especially in a strange place , I 'll never know what 's happening . Like a blind man at the ball game , I need a radio . When I see this way I analyze and pry . I hurl over logs and roll away stones ; I study the bank a square foot at a time , probing and tilting my head . Some days when a mist covers the mountains , when the muskrats wo n't show and the microscope 's mirror shatters , I want to climb " 45 up the blank blue dome as a man would storm the inside of a circus tent , wildly , dangling , and with a steel knife claw a rent in the top , peep , and , if I must , fall . But there is another kind of seeing that involves a letting go . When I see this way I sway transfixed and emptied . The difference between the two ways of seeing is the difference between walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera I walk from shot to shot , reading the light on a calibrated meter . When I walk without a camera , my own shutter opens , and the moment 's light prints on my own silver gut . When I see this second way I am above all an unscrupulous observer . It was sunny one evening last summer at Tinker Creek ; the sun was low in the sky , upstream . I was sitting on the sycamore log bridge with the sunset at my back , watching the shiners the size of minnows who were feeding over the muddy sand in skittery schools . Again and again , one fish , then another , turned for a split second across the current and flash ! the sun shot out from its silver side . I could n't watch for it . It was always just happening somewhere else , and it drew my vision just as it disappeared : flash ! like a sudden dazzle of the thinnest blade , a sparking over a dun and olive ground at chance intervals from every direction . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small , floating from under my feet on the creek 's surface , very slow and steady . So I blurred my eyes and gazed toward the brim of my bat and saw a new world . I saw the pale white circles roll up , roll up , like the world 's turning , mute and perfect , and I saw the linear flashes , gleaming silver , like stars being born at random down a rolling scroll of time . Something broke and something opened . I filled up like a new wineskin . I breathed an air like light ; I saw a light like water . I was the lip of a fountain the creek filled forever ; I was ether , the leaf in the zephyr ; I was flesh-flake , feather , bone . When I see this way I see truly . As Thoreau says , I return to my senses . I am the man who watches the baseball game in silence in an empty stadium . I see the game purely ; I 'm abstracted and dazed . When it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field to their shadowed dugouts , I leap to my feet , I cheer and cheer . UT I CA N'T GO OUT AND TRY to see this way . B I 'll fail , I 'll go mad . All I can do is try to gag the commentator , to hush the noise of useless interior babble that keeps me from seeing just as surely as a newspaper dangled before my eyes . The effort is really a discipline requiring a lifetime of dedicated struggle ; it marks the literature of saints and monks of every order east and west , under every rule and no rule , discalced and shod . The world 's spiritual geniuses seem to discover universally that the mind 's muddy river , this ceaseless flow of trivia and trash , can not be dammed , and that trying to dam it is a waste of effort that might lead to madness . Instead you must allow the muddy river to flow unheeded in the dim channels of consciousness ; you raise your sights ; you look along it , mildly , acknowledging its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the real where subjects and objects act and rest purely , without utterance . " Launch into the deep , " says Jacques Ellul , " and you shall see . " The secret of seeing , then , is the pearl of great price . If I thought he could teach me to find it and keep it forever I would stagger barefoot across a hundred deserts after any lunatic at all . But although the pearl may be found , it may not be sought . The literature of illumination reveals this above all : although it comes to those who wait for it , it is always , even to the most practiced and adept , a gift and a total surprise . I return from one walk knowing where the killdeer nests in the field by the creek and the hour the laurel blooms . I return from the same walk a day later scarcely knowing my own name . Litanies hum in my ears ; my tongue flaps in my mouth , Alimonon , alleluia ! I can not cause light ; the most I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its beam .

When her doctor took her bandages off and led her into the garden , the girl who was no longer blind saw " the tree with the lights in it . " It was for this tree 1 searched through the peach orchards of summer , in the forests of fall and down winter and spring for years . Then one day I was walking along Tinker Creek thinking of nothing at all and I saw the tree with the lights in it .
