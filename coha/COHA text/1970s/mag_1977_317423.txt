The White House staff had already set up an office in the laundry room , and the telephone company had installed special phones . Over the barn door a red , white and blue banner announced MARYWOOD FARMS WELCOMES PRESIDENT CARTER . <P> At 10 p.m. last Friday , Jimmy Carter arrived at the 1,600-acre farm in Indianola , Iowa , 16 miles outside Des Moines , to spend the night as a guest of Farmer Woodrow Wilson Diehl and his wife Mary , It was the President 's second overnight visit with an American family-and the Diehls ' second visit from a President . In 1966 Lyndon Johnson stopped by for a few hours to look over Marywood , one of Iowa 's showcase farms , on his way to a Democratic fund raiser in Des Moines . <P> Fatigued by his trip , Carter chatted with the Diehls , their son Ted , 41 , and his family . After a nightcap-a glass of buttermilk-in the kitchen , the President retired to the Diehls ' bright turquoise master bedroom . His hosts bunked in a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his guest 's door . Said he : " Mr. President , there 's something I forgot to tell you last night . The knobs on the shower are reversed . Hot 's cold and cold 's hot . " <P> Last summer Woody Diehl spent a lot of time in front of the picture window in the spacious living room of his wood and brick ranch house staring out at acres of corn stunted by drought . When the Diehls and eight other local farm families met with Carter next morning over coffee and rolls baked by a neighbor , the costly effects of central Iowa 's drought were on all their minds . The group also discussed federal disaster assistance for farmers-Diehl himself will be eligible for payments this year-and the Administration 's proposed feed-grains set-aside program . <P> During the hour-long kaffeeklatsch , the President sat on the arm of the living room couch , and at one point invited Diehl , who was chairman of Iowa Farmers for Carter in the 1976 campaign , to stop by the White House to talk some more . Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrowheads , and accepted a big hug from her granddaughter Wendy , 11 . For Woody Diehl , the occasion was " beautiful . " Said he after Carter 's departure : " He 's a farmer . He understood exactly what we meant . "
