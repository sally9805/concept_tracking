Thousands of cholera cases alarm the Middle East <P> The first cases were reported in Syria and were followed quickly by others in Lebanon , Jordan , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Iran . By last week , almost the entire Middle East was in the grip or under the threat of an ancient and dreaded scourge : cholera . Thousands of cases and scores of deaths were registered , but the official figures in several countries were deliberately understated-for reasons of national pride , trade and tourism . Says Dr. Reinhard Lindner , a World Health Organization ( WHO ) communicable disease expert : " Cholera is the hush-hush disease of our time . It bears the stigma of dirt and ignorance . " <P> The epidemic seemed most severe in Syria , where 3,000 cases , with 68 deaths , were recorded by last week . The government requested and received help in the form of drugs and advisers from WHO , and the U.S. donated $25,000 worth of emergency supplies to Damascus . Syria denied responsibility for being the original source of the outbreak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on peace-keeping duty in devastated Beirut were said to have picked up the disease and carried it back to Damascus and their native villages . That may be true , but the rapid spread of the disease did not speak well for Syrian medicine and sanitation . Indeed , President Assad rebuked his health authorities for their poor performance . They responded by closing swimming pools , public beaches , fruit juice and ice cream parlors , and many restaurants . Proprietors of the restaurants that remained open were warned that any violation of food laws could mean immediate imprisonment . To add to the troubles , Syria 's agriculture was threatened with disaster as its bumper crops of fruits and vegetables were blackballed by markets from one end of the Arab world to the other . <P> Lebanese officials meanwhile admitted to knowing of only 20 cases in their country ( unofficial estimate : 100 ) . Jordan announced 314 cases , Saudi Arabia 17 . Israel had three , all West Bank residents , one of whom had traveled to Jordan . While Turkey remained silent about the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nijmegen , The Netherlands , from the Turkish city of Erzurum was hospitalized with cholera . The four other cases in Europe also involved victims who had been traveling in either Turkey or Iraq . Opposition politicians in Turkey accused the Ankara government of hiding the news that 34 children had died of cholera . <P> Cairo insisted that Egypt was still cholera free , and took the precaution of checking travelers from affected countries . Hundreds who did not have up-to-date vaccination certificates were quarantined ; cholera can incubate in the body for as long as five days before symptoms appear . Incoming planes were fumigated as soon as they landed . The health ministry launched a massive campaign to inoculate 13 million Egyptians . Authorities burned every garbage heap they could find in Cairo and Alexandria .
