One year ago last week , President Nixon jolted the world by announcing a nearly total reversal in U.S. economic policy . He aimed to put three enormously complex problems on the road to solution before Election Day . Here is a capsule report card on his New Economic Policy in each area : <P> SLOWING INFLATION . The latest consumer price index was 2.9% higher than a year earlier , and the increase is decelerating to an annual rate that should be closer to 2.5% by year 's end . But food prices have gone up at a much faster 3.2% . Weekly earnings are up 6.1 % and , when adjusted for inflation , provide about 3.2% more real buying power than the paychecks of a year ago . Rating : good . <P> <P> BALANCING INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS . <P> <P> The U.S. deficit continued to balloon until devaluation of the dollar late last year , but is improving in 1972 . The shortfall totaled $4.1 billion in the first six months , v. $11.9 billion a year earlier . The red-ink figure is still high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistently exceeding exports . Rating : fair . <P> EXPANDING THE ECONOMY AND CUTTING UNEMPLOYMENT . The gross national product lately has been running at $96 billion ahead of a year ago , a very healthy 9.2% gain . But unemployment has dropped only from 6.1% last summer to 5.5% now . Rating : superior on expansion but unacceptable on jobs .
