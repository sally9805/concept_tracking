SLOWLY , deliberately , the white-clad figure emerged from the spindly spacecraft and stepped into the glaring sunlight . In every direction stretched the barren hills and " ridges of a forbidding landscape that has remained virtually unchanged since the moon was created . Alan Shepard could hardly describe what he saw . " It certainly is a stark place here at Fra Mauro , " he said . Then , as his image flickered onto millions of TV screens back on earth , the 47-year-old Navy captain took the last two steps down the ladder of Antares , the lunar lander . Finally his heavy boots scuffed the soft , grayish-brown dust of the moon 's ancient highlands . " It 's been a long way , " said Shepard , the first and oldest American ever to journey into space . " But we 're here . " <P> Four Americans had already trod on lunar soil , and the TV picture-the ghostly figure on the ladder , the sharp contrast between the black sky and the sun-drenched land-was strikingly familiar . Yet , for millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on the distant moon was still a wondrous experience . It was a dramatic reminder of what man , at his technological best , can achieve . <P> Moments later , Shepard 's crewmate , Edgar Mitchell , followed him down the ladder . Twice the 40-year-old Navy commander hopped off the bottom steps . The relaxed grip of lunar gravity left him as exhilarated as a child in a playground . " Mobility is very great under this ' crushing ' one-sixth-G load , " Mitchell told Mission Control back home in Houston . Then , with slow , effortless strides , Shepard and Mitchell teamed up for the most ambitious program of lunar exploration ever undertaken . For nearly ten hours , the fifth and sixth human visitors to the moon crisscrossed their Fra Mauro landing site , set up a $25 million package of scientific instruments , collected 108 lbs . of rocks and soil , and ventured more than half a mile from their ship up the 400-ft. - high walls of a crater . <P> Recalcitrant Probe . From the very start of the nine-day voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitches that repeatedly tested the patience , skill and ingenuity of both the astronauts and the technicians on the ground . Barely three hours after the rain-delayed launch , the mission was in serious trouble . After cutting Kitty Hawk loose , turning it about in space , and trying to extract the lunar module Antares from the nose of the third-stage S-4B rocket , Command Ship Pilot Stu Roosa encountered a mysterious docking problem . Five times he edged his spacecraft toward the lunar module , but Kitty Hawk 's docking probe stubbornly refused to catch inside the funnelshaped receptacle atop Antares . Inexplicably , the probe 's three spring-loaded latches , which worked flawlessly on previous missions , refused to grab .
