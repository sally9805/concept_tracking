When President Nixon nominated General Creighton Abrams to take over as Army Chief of Staff , military experts praised Nixon 's choice and predicted that Abrams would win quick Senate approval and get on with the job . At 57 , after a long and distinguished Army career , Abrams might normally have had the post almost by acclamation . But now , his appointment may have run afoul of election-year politics . <P> The snag came after Air Force General John Lavelle admitted to the House Armed Services Committee that he ordered the falsification of records of unauthorized bombing missions while under Abrams ' command in Viet Nam . Lavelle was demoted to lieutenant general and forced to retire for his cavalier transgressions . In testimony given before the committee , he told Congressmen that he thought Abrams might have known about at least some of the illegal air strikes ( TIME , June 26 ) . But he added that he was " positive " Abrams knew nothing of the false reports that Lavelle ordered filed by airmen who took part in the missions . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the false reports and of only one or two of the illegal North Viet Nam strikes , which he considered unfortunate mistakes . <P> Iowa 's Democratic Senator Harold Hughes , however , has been pressing for a fuller investigation . " The primary issue is not General Lavelle , " Hughes told the Senate , " but the command and control system which permitted-and then allowed to be concealed-the unauthorized attacks against North Viet Nam . Nor should General Lavelle be made the lone scapegoat if it turns out that others in the chain of command are also responsible . " <P> Abrams arrived in Washington on July 16 and began Pentagon briefings meant to prepare him for the normally amiable question-and-answer ritual that usually precedes confirmation of presidential military appointees . But furor over the Lavelle affair has made the issue politically sticky , and a final date for Abrams ' hearing has been repeatedly pushed back . Democrats would like to have the Lavelle-Abrams issue argued before the Senate and the public later in the campaign , preferably in October ; Republicans want to get the case out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to avoid conflict with their convention last week . Meantime , General William Westmoreland has retired from the top job , and Army Vice Chief of Staff General Bruce C. Palmer Jr . has been serving as chief , waiting for the announcement . " It 's an unprecedented case , " says one angry Army general . " It 's hard on Abe and it 's goddam hard on the Army that 's been waiting for him and needs him . "
