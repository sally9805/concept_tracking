When Philadelphia police broke up a demonstration by black high school students in November 1967 , School Superintendent Mark Shedd protested angrily to Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo . In Shedd 's view , the cops were unnecessarily rough with the students and had undercut his efforts to negotiate with them about a black studies program . The commissioner strongly disagreed , and as Shedd recaHs their meeting , Rizzo told him : " If it 's the last thing I do , I 'm gon na get your ass . " <P> Rizzo did . He made Shedd 's " permissiveness " a major issue in his successful campaign for mayor this fall . Immediately after the election , Mayor James Tate at Rizzo 's behest appointed two known opponents of Shedd 's to the school board , thereby reducing the supporters of the superintendent to a minority . Last week , just before the board met to fire him , Shedd , 45 , accepted the inevitable and resigned . <P> Fast Redo . Shedd has been widely regarded as one of the nation 's most progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one suburban colleague puts it , was that he " tried to redo fast a school system that had just been through 30 years of inactivity . " Shedd graduated from the University of Maine and has a doctorate in education from Harvard . He first came to the attention of politicians and educators in the early 1960s , when , as superintendent in Englewood , N.J. , he successfully cooled the racial tensions that flared over school integration . In 1967 he took command of the school system of the nation 's fourth largest city . <P> Soon after his appointment , Shedd began to decentralize the large ( 285,000 students ) and cumbersome system by giving principals greater autonomy . At the same time , he streamlined administrative procedures . In the wake of the 1967 protests , Shedd installed one of the nation 's first large-scale black studies programs , including courses in Swahili . Shedd 's best-known project was developing the Parkway " school without walls " ( TIME , March 23 , 1970 ) , which tried to combat student restlessness by holding classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rizzo 's police academy . Morale in the system rose ; in a number of schools , so did elementary reading scores , spurred by an intensive remedial reading program . <P> Alienating Whites . Philadelphia , meanwhile , was inexorably generating the kind of pressures that have cut the average tenure of big city school superintendents to three years during the past half decade . The foundation grants and federal aid that Shedd had obtained to launch his lively ideas were cut back by the recession . In addition , his reforms provoked opposition from the entrenched school bureaucracy , which did not take to Shedd 's often aloof and highhanded manner . Although his new programs were not designed exclusively for the long-neglected problems of black students , few of the innovations percolated into the classrooms of low and middle-income white children , whose parents are Philadelphia 's voting majority .
