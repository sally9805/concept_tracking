txt " From now on , this is going to be , a way of life . " The speaker : John Carver , former Commissioner of the Federal Power Commission , talking from an air-conditioned ' committee . office on Capitol Hill . His subject : . New York City in the age of the power crisis . Any doubts that New York had come of age were dispelled last week . Temperatures in the 90 's  --  and ' a smoggy inversion  --  sent residents running for air-conditioned apartments and offices , placing a record-breaking load on Consolidated Edison 's power . capacity . Equipment failures added to the utility 's woes . The upshot : Airconditioners , electric clocks and light bulbs tripped off at one time or , another in every borough except Staten Island , for periods of . time ranging from 15 minutes to 15- hours . And hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers ; feeling the effects of powerlessness , found it better to light a candle  --  and curse Con Ed 's darkness . South Brooklyn went out at 9:45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Brooklyn Veterans Administration Hospital to begin hand operation of an electric respirator and rocking bed that was keeping a patient alive . Tony Portello dragged huge sides of beef to the base . ment when the refrigeration in his meat market failed . Felicia Salmonese had to throw out all of the hand-made potato salad and rice pudding in her delicatessen on Bay Ridge Avenue . ? But the problems in Brooklyn were only the beginning . Outages , as the blackout is euphemistically known , began springing up elsewhere . Riverdale in the Bronx , areas of Queens , scattered portions of Manhattan found their voltages diminished or in some cases slashed completely as blue and white Con Edison trucks rushed from block to block seeking to hold together a system that ap ' peered to be disintegrating in the 90-degree heat . ( The company called it a " heat storm , " a new addition to the lexicon of suffering . ) " Their reserve is so marginal they simply ca n't afford the loss of a single one of their major units , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning division of the New York Public Service Commission in Albany . The crisis seemed to divide itself into two distincts facets  --  the immediate problem of collapsing " networks " and the longer-range question of supply , or just where the power will continue to come from . The loss of power to 200,000 customers in Brooklyn Monday night was caused by a failure of six of the 10 " feeder lines , " the 27,000-volt hightension power lines that in the countryside sit atop row upon row of steelgirdered towers but in New York City are crowded together beneath the pavements . Under normal loads ? at . 3 o'clock in the morning or on a mid-winter afternoon  --  the remaining four lines leading into Bay Ridge , Sunset Park and Gowanus could have taken up the slack . But they too were running . at full tilt , carrying every volt they could handle . To prevent a burnout and collapse of the whole network , Con Edison executives ordered a shutdown . The postmortem on the six offending cables has still not been completed . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water seepage and , of course , the tremendous heat building up under the pavements were ? all blamed for the failures there and ' in scores of other scattered locations throughout the city . With regard to the ? demands on capacity , " they ' were lucky , " one P.S.C. ? official said of Con ' Ed . " So far they have n't had to go for more than a 5 per cent reduction throughout their network , and the consumer ca n't really feel , that appreciably . But . when you get to the next increment , 8 . per . cent , then things begin to happen . " At that point , home air-condi- ? toners cut out , television sets dim , lights glow feebly . And the statistics did not look encouraging . Last month , Con Edison estimated the highest possible peak demand at 8,400,000 kilowatts . And , it figured , it could supply 10,598,000 kilowatts ? an apparently hefty cushion . But that cushion includes 600,000 kilowatts from the Bowline plant in upstate New York . And Bowline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam and has still to produce a single kilowatt of power . Moreover , Con Edison estimates that on an average day about 2.3-million kilowatts of power generators are out of service so ? called " unavailable New York capacity . " Last week , however , there was one day with ? more than threemillion kilowatts worth of generators out . And , despite hundreds of thousands of kilowatts purchased from contributing power companies as far away as Ontario Hydroelectric Company in Canada and in New England , there were still problems . High-tension ? long-distance ? trans. mission lines . quickly reached their capacity and , in one crucial case in Dutchess County , failed completely . The Long Island Lighting Company lost its 300,000-kilowatt third generator at Northport , L. I. , and dropped out of the grid . And gas turbines at Ravenswood in . Queens and a conventional unit at Astoria failed at crucial periods , the P.S.C. said . " Why us ? " was a question millions of New Yorkers were asking last week . " Why does n't it happen in other large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . Power ' companies serving Detroit and ( ) tidying areas of Michigan cut voltages by .5 per cent last Thursday for five hours . Electrical storms and other " acts of God " cost the New England Power Exchange some 500,000 kilowatts of power last week . One result was that Rhode Island was almost completely blacked out for a period . But , in general , Con Edison 's problems are unique . No other utility carries so high a power load . While Con Edison was forecasting last month a peak demand of 8,400,000 kilowatts this summer , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was predicting only a 3,445,000 kilowatt high . Moreover , environmentalists hereabouts have had particular success in blocking construction of new power plants . One of their concerns : The air pollution such plants would produce . It 's all something of a vicious circle . Smog descends ... use of air-conditioners soars ... power supply falls short , in part for lack of new capacity ... which had been short-circuited by fears of ? smog.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
