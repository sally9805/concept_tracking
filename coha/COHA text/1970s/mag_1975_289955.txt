The call for law-and-order has literally become a battle cry in America . In 1972 citizens took heart that some headway was being made in the battle against criminals ; the figures for serious crime showed a drop of 4% that year . By 1973 , however , the percentages were climbing again , and they are still going up . Last week the Federal Bureau of Investigation released its statistics for 1974 : crime in seven major categories-jumped 17% above the 1973 figures-the highest annual rise since 1960 . <P> The biggest increase was not in urban areas . In towns with populations of 100,000 or more , the increase in the number of reported crimes was 13% , four points below the national average ; in the nation 's six largest cities , the increase was 10% . The big jump came beyond city limits . The suburbs ( reported crime up 20% ) and rural areas ( 21% ) seemed to be catching up to big cities . Actually , they are still behind , since they started from a much lower base . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up 20% , burglary 17% . <P> The statistics tell only part of the story . The Justice Department calculates that about one-third of all violent crimes go unreported , an estimate that some legal experts think is far too low . Attorney General Edward H. Levi pessimistically terms the increase " predictable " and calls for greater attention to the deterrence of criminal acts . As a first step , Levi called for a new federal gun-control law that would ban possession of hand guns on the streets of high crime cities . <P> <P> * Murder , rape , robbery , aggravated assault , burglary , larceny-theft and auto theft .
