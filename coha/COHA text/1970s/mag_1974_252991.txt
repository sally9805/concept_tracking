FOR PETE 'S SAKE Directed by PETER YATES Screenplay by STANLEY SHAPIRO and MAURICE RICHLIN <P> The screwball comedy stubbornly refuses to be reborn . It flourished in the ' 30s and into the ' 40s , urged on by the talents of such as Howard Hawks ( Bringing Up Baby , His Girl Friday ) and Preston Sturges ( Sullivan 's Travels , The Lady Eve ) and considerably abetted by the general delirium of the times . The format flourished under Sturges all during World War II but died out soon after the war ended . <P> Now that film makers are paying scrupulous attention to the old genres , and such formulas as the police thriller , the horror flick and the private-eye caper have been dusted off with success , screwball comedy was hardly likely to escape . All in the name of homage , Peter Bogdanovich ripped off Bringing Up Baby , called it What 's Up Doc ? and made himself a hit . Doc also represented Barbra Streisand 's initiation into the realm of frenetic comedy . <P> If eye-popping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a comedienne , then Streisand would be the new Carole Lombard . But she has none of Lombard 's ease of spirit , her giddy eccentricity or quick , akimbo intelligence . Streisand is only aggressive . She scrounges for laughs like a bargain-basement shopper . <P> Here she plays a Brooklyn housewife named Henrietta , whose cab-driver husband Pete ( Michael Sarrazin ) is 32 years old and still trying to pull himself through college . One early summer 's day , Pete 's dispatcher down at the garage passes along a hot commodities-market tip : a trade deal with the Russians will make the price of pork bellies go through the roof come July . All Pete needs is $3,000 capital . He is without much enterprise ( let it not be forgotten that Michael Sarrazin is not the star of this movie ) , so Henrietta goes out to get the grubstake . This initially involves doing business with a loan shark . The pork-belly deal is delayed , so the shark sells her contract to a madam , who sells it to a couple of Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As each new situation becomes increasingly preposterous , laughter is supposed to rise in proportion . <P> The movie , however , is like a case of aggravated assault , so eager , so desperate is it to be funny . Director Peter Yates ( Bullitt ) manages action briskly enough , but the script remains intractable . It was written by the authors of Pillow Talk and offers the same sort of antique situation comedy : a virtuous woman flirts with immorality and emerges unsullied and , indeed , victorious . Achieving this happy result requires some odd fancy-stepping . Pete , knowing that his wife had tried to be a whore ( but not knowing , as the audience does , that she had been unsuccessful at it ) , forgives her by giving her a ring and proclaiming his pride that she loved him enough to " sell herself . " <P> That the writers obviously mean Pete to believe this , and intend for audiences to accept it as well , is one of the few genuinely amusing things in the movie . Written right and played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of denouement that was a Preston Sturges specialty , an inadvertent confession of blindness and stupidity . It could have had a well-honed double edge of irony , but such style should not really be expected from film makers who prefer a bludgeon to a blade . "
