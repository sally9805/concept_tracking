THE LAST TYCOON <P> Directed by ELIA KAZAN <P> Screenplay by HAROLD PINTER <P> In the thick , solitary splendor of the movie studio , Monroe Stahr weaves dreams . He watches images flicker by in the screening room , demands improvement . Amendments , modifications , excisions-all flow in the sharp , regular rhythm of a master musician keeping time by snapping his fingers . " The last scene was too gory-cut out one roll of the table , " or , " Reshoot the whole scene . " His taste is peerless , but it would have to be . The production chief of a major studio like MGM in the early ' 30s , Stahr holds absolute authority . <P> Stahr can not credit , either , the fact that there are some people who might decline to share his dreams of patchwork celluloid . Kathleen Moore , a girl Stahr sees as his own perfect romantic vision , a shade of his dead wife , does not even go to the movies . " Why not ? " Stahr asks her , seriously puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they need . " Kathleen contradicts him . " What you need . " <P> The Last Tycoon is a reasonably scrupulous adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's unfinished tragedy about the strange refractions of Monroe Stahr 's life . It makes for a flawed , divided movie , sometimes full of cool , funny insight , sometimes crippled by the flyaway myths of movietown . <P> Unwearied Egos . The film shares roughly the strengths and weaknesses of the novel . Perceptions about the giddy excesses and malformed ironies of the movie business come through strongest : the unweaned egos of the people who make movies , the pushcart buccaneering of the studio heads who subsidize them . Monroe Stahr ( Robert De Niro ) belongs to both worlds . If movies are dreams for him , they are yard goods for his studio colleagues . Stahr insists on making a big-budget quality movie that may never turn a profit . He does it over the protests of the corporate lawyer , Fleishacker ( Ray Milland ) , and Studio Chief Pat Brady ( Robert Mitchum ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Jesus . " As much as his uncertain health and assaults of melancholy , it is good taste that ultimately undoes Stahr and permits Brady and the board of directors to ace him out of his job . <P> Always a shrewd , careful scenarist ( Accident , The Go-Between ) , Harold Pinter pays particular attention to the functional unreality of moviemaking . In one scene-not from Fitzgerald-a film editor expires noiselessly during the running of a new film . He is slumped in the front-row leather armchair , head rolled to one side in what must have been a last act of deference to the assembled executives . No last words , not even a cry for help . " He probably did n't want to disturb the screening , " muses one of the nabobs.
