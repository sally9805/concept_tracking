 | Black coaxial cables lie coiled through the murky aisles of the theater like dozing pythons ; cameramen hunch over their red-eyed machines . Liza Minnelli , the knock-out nightclub performer and star of the recent film Cabaret , is doing retakes for her TV special , Liza with a Z , videotaped several days earlier . In the front row of the tawdry theater , for the benefit of the TV audience , sit 45 people in tuxedos and evening gowns ? all actors from central casting , literally hired hands . Liza is running through a new song in her repertoire , It Was a Good Time , done in a medley style with snatches of nursery rhymes woven into the regular lyrics . It is an aching song as Liza does it , with tense , brassy orchestration as she sings , " Bye baby bunting , daddy 's gone ahunting .... Daddy 's gone ! " The music blares angrily as she sings , " Mama will stay near you , Mama will be near you ... . Not your dad ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , Liza is beating clenched fists against her thighs , like a child caught in a shuddering , white-hot tantrum . Back in her dressing room , out of costume , Liza slumps in a rickety chair , panty hose bagging , a maroon towel thrown casually across her breasts , her spiky coif dripping . She fumbles with tremi ) ling , false-nailed fingers trying in vain to pry open a can of Coke ( the machine was out of diet drinks ) . " Careful , " says her dresser . " For God 's sake , do n't break a nail . " Liza smiles sheepishly and hands over the can for someone else to pop open . Rescued from that ordeal , she drinks with stillshaking hands . When she goes back on stage to reshoot a number , the 45 hired hands give her a round of spontaneous , hearty applause . Liza looks surprised , and pleased . Her hands have stopped  | shaking . A little smile lights up her face . She whips into her next song with a foxy wink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape .... Once , she was just Judy Garland 's little girl , a cute kid with big , brown , Elsie Borden eyes and a treasured Hopalong Cassidy outfit . She hoofed along in Mama 's limelight , with a lot of other precocious Hollywood tots trying to figure out where their next daddy or mommy was coming from . Then , via musical comedy ( Flora , the Red Menace ) and movies ( The Sterile Cuckoo ) , she became , in her teens , a show-biz luminary in her own right . Now , with more movies , TV specials and a popular nightclub act she takes around the world , Liza Minnelli is a seasoned singer , dancer and actress who earns around a million dollars a year . She has arrived : a bona fide superstar . The Hopalong togs are far behind . She has an entire wardrobe designed especially for her by couturier Halston , and she is on the list of America 's Ten Best Dressed Women . She has gone to Paris and enthralled the demanding Olympia music-hall audience three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playboy Baron Alexis de Rede and the Rothschild crowd . France 's great balladeers , Jacques Brel and Charles Aznavour , are her friends and admirers . And she may well win an Oscar for her role in Cabaret as Sally Bowles , the wacky but lovable tart-with-a-heart who hankered madly after stardom in 1930s Berlin . The drizzly Sunday night last February when Cabaret premiered in New York , a radiant Liza , decked out in a clingy white gown and white chinchilla cape , was grinning and mugging happily on the arm of chestnut-haired actor Desi Arnaz , Jr. , her current amour , a star of the movie Red Sky at Morning and a close family friend who also has a famous mama , Lucille Ball . He is 19 ; Liza is 26 . At that point , she denied rumors that she and young Desi were engaged , though they had exchanged gold rings and she recently had joined him in Japan , where he was filming a movie about Marco Polo . " Somebody kept pestering him about us , " she explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that his intentions were honorable . They took it from there and started saying we were engaged . But how can I be engaged ? I 'm not even divorced yet . " For legal reasons that involve the alien status of her husband , Australian singercomedian Peter Allen , Liza 's divorce has been long in coming . Judy Garland introduced Peter and Liza after she had hired the handsome young Aussie for her own nightclub  | act . The matchmaking blossomed into marriage in 1967 , a union that began in a **33;1172;TOOLONG atmosphere . Stories then cast Liza as an aproned homemaker , whipping up cannellonis or Russian meatballs and musing like any other happy housewife over the two children she and Peter contemplated having . But the smell of greasepaint turned out to be stronger than that of simmering tomato sauce . The marriage was strained when Liza 's career ( she had already had a movie part with Albert Finney in Charley Bubbles ) took off like a skyrocket . " Everything was good for about a year and a half because we talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then every time my work went up and he was having trouble , the guilt I felt made me terribly unhappy . And the strain he felt trying to make me not be unhappy ... well , it just got so complicated that we suddenly stopped talking . We were doing A Star Is Born together . That was the saddest part , losing communication with your best friend . We finally got to the point where holding on became so painful we finally had to break . " Normally effervescent , Liza admits it was not easy to push down the pain of the break . But when she was filming Cabaret in West Germany last year , a smooth-talking , blond young musician , named Rex Kramer , was in close attendance . Back in the States after the movie was finished , Kramer took Liza home to his grandparents ' farm in Arkansas , where the city-bred star reveled in the simple , down-home life of Mason jars and front-porch rockers ? until Mrs. Rex Kramer slapped her with an alienationof-affections suit . The case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after Rex and Liza had split with considerable bitterness ( he is one of the very few people who has anything bad to say about Liza ) . Now it 's Desi , Jr. , a soft-spoken , gently sarcastic music buff and surfing enthusiast who , despite his youth , has already supplied Hollywood with some of its juiciest gossip . Sporting a diamond as big as the Ritz , Liza admitted last fall that they were engaged , " but we 're not talking about it , " she cautioned with what seemed to be a trace of anxious superstition . Liza 's love-life has manifestly not been easy . Some of her followers see dark , maternal patterns in her relationships , a possible  | repeat of her mother 's five attempts to grab the marital brass ring . ( Liza 's father , screen director Vincente Minnelli , was married three times . ) " Actually , my romantic life is very small , " insists Liza . " I 've had fewer flings than most 16-year-old girls today have had . I was with Rex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom because I suddenly realized that I 'd never had any . I was used to being so old , so responsible . Somehow , I felt I 'd missed something : I 'd blown it somehow . I 'd never really been a teenager , so I decided to backtrack a little . " And , sighing wryly , she says : " When I was 11 , I was hiring Mama 's household staff . God , it must have been hilarious . Out comes this 11-year-old kid and says , May I see your references , please ? ' " The kid had a lot on her mind ? and on her shouldes . She 'd been five when he pa.entc had separated and she 'd gone to live with her mother , although continuing to see a lot of her father . By 1969 , when her mother died and Liza alone had arranged and paid for the funeral , a Paris friend commented : " In a sense , she became the mother of her mother . " Now , she is responsible mainly to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17 , about whom she is frankly maternal . Lorna , now 20 , is a willowy young singer who , a la Cher Bono , loves the cool , manicured , vampy look of the ' 30s and ' 40s ; her carefully cultivated fingernails are as long and lustrous as Liza 's are bitten to the quick ; her manner as ironic and restrained as Liza 's is bubbly and daring . But both sisters share a deeply bonded loyalty . Liza bristles at any criticism ? personal or professional ? of Lorna , and usually invites her up on stage to sing at any show of Liza 's she is attending . ( At Lama 's own supperclub appearance in New York in October , Liza returned the favor . ) Joey , a high-school student , spent the summer exploring Califom.nia in a jeep . " He 's normal , " says his sister , Lorna . " He does n't want to go into show business . " Liza , of course , is Show Biz , but in important ways very unlike her legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being a girl who keeps her promises . She rarely plays prima donna . Nor , one gathers as the result of her past experiences with mama , does she drink much or take drugs ; her usual alcoholic beverage is Scotch and Coke ( " a real high school drink , huh ? " she says with a selfmocking wince ) or a French cordial . She admits to having tried marijuana , but says " it did nothing for me . " She is adamantly opposed to pills , even aspirin : " Rather than a fear of what drugs can do to you , " says long-time friend Gayle Martin ( Dean Martin 's daughter ) , " Liza has a knowledge . " She dislikes talking about the sad times in her life connected with her mother . But , like bruises , the dark spots of childhood crop up vividly in her conversation . She remembers the wailing suicide threats and Judy 's many attempts ( most of them theatrical or halfhearted ) to make them good ; the night Judy first left home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembers moving in the night , secretly , to avoid bill collectors when Judy was broke . There were poker-playing detectives in Judy 's house in London after her mother had split with her third husband , Sid Luft ( Judy was afraid he would try to kidnap Lorna and Joey ) . And she recalls one of the many nights her mama was deep in the blues , and lamented : " I 've worked all my life and I have no money ; I have nothing to leave you . " And Liza adds : " When Mama was down in the dumps , I 'd say , ' Come on , Mom , let 's go to the park and ride the roller coaster . ' " Though life with an often distraught Judy was itself an emotional roller  | coaster , Liza prefers remembering the happy times . She values highly her mother 's sense of humor ? which could express itself in oddly ironic ways . Once , a journalist was arriving to interview Judy , one whom the great star suspected of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill-taking so often gossiped about . In an I'll-show-him lark she splashed vodka everywhere and put on smeary lipstick and an old , ripped dress . When the writer arrived , Judy flung open the door and , reeling like a ridiculous parody of herself , slurred : " You think I drink and take pills all the time , do n't you ? Well , here 's your story ! " But there were lighter moments . Judy once begged Liza to attend one of her weddings , but Liza was booked to do a show . " I ca n't , I just ca n't come , Mama , " Liza pleaded . " But I promise I 'll come to the next one ! " One summer , Judy decided Liza was working too hard and ordered her to quit a stock show . Responsibly , Liza refused . Judy then announced to the newspapers that her daughter was quitting , but Liza rushed to deny it the next day . Finally , Judy threatened to drag her off the stage opening night . " I was literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but what I found waiting for me was a case of champagne . The note with it was so like Mama : You are an admirable young woman , but you exasperate me ! ' " Her loyalty to Mom is almost surpassed by her fierce devotion to her father , who directed such movies as An American in Paris and Meet Me in St. Louis . " My Dad 's influenced me so much , " says Liza . " He spoiled me rotten , but with love . I can remember him taking me to the Ice Capades when I was four . I had on a white frilly dress . I looked around at the other kids and said , Daddy , I 'm not dressed right , I do n't want to go , I do n't feel good ! " And Minnelli , a busy movie mogul , drove her all the way back home , let her change clothes and brought her back . A former camp counselor recalls that when eight-year-old Liza was sent to camp in the mountains 90 miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep with homesickness . Minnelli drove up every weekend to see her ; Judy came twice . " He really understood me , " says Liza now . " He treated me like such a lady . Even then , he dealt with me on a feminine level . To do that to a little girl is probably the most valuable thing that can happen . " Whenever she was with her father , life was strangely idyllic . Like a little princess , Liza used to ride on the boom that raised and lowered the camera when Minnelli was directing a movie . He even had pint-sized replicas of costumes used in his movies made up for Liza , who with friends like Gayle Martin and Portland Mason ( James Mason 's daughter ) wore them in evening " musicales " the kids worked up for their parents . One night , Minnelli came out onto the lawn in his tuxedo on his way to a party , only to sit for hours in the dewy grass watching Liza and company strut and sing . ( When Judy watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sing out ! " or " Kick higher ! " she 'd cry . ) It 's a long way from those zany , Good Ship Lollipop routines to the revealing , complicated movie roles Liza has played : in 1968 , Pookie Adams , the kooky , love-hungry , toughly fatalistic college waif in The Sterile Cuckoo ; in 1969 , the hideously scarred Junie Moon in the movie of that name ; and in 1971 , Cabaret 's effervescently amoral Sally Bowles , the would-be femme fatale who does n't quite have enough fatale . Liza excelled in these roles ( she was nominated for an Oscar for the Pookie role , but lost to Maggie Smith ) because they are fused with the facts of her own life . And she knew this early . ( Gayle Martin reveals that Liza tried for 14 auditions to get the stage part of Sally Bowles in the Broadway musical version of Cabaret , and was crushed when the role went to English actress Jill Haworth . ) " It took me three years to get the Pookie Adams part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know wanted it ? like Patty Duke and Elizabeth Hartman . Gals would come ' to the casting office in kooky clothes and trip over the doorstep and bite their nails trying to be Pookie . " But Liza knew who Pookie was . And this is perhaps her greatest strength as an actress ; she has arrived at that unique creative summit seldom achieved by young actresses : She finds her roles in herself and herself in her roles . Like Pookie , Liza is a girl who is constantly reaching out to life and just as constantly withdrawing from it . She worries about her development as a mature young woman at the same time as she craves the thrill of new experiences . The move from lonely , nail-biting Pookie to devil-may-care Sally Bowles vamping it up with a dashing German baron seems a natural one for the new , jet-set Liza who wings around Europe with the titled rich . But the Pookie in her has not been cast aside ; the Sally has more likely been grafted onto it . Of course , the question everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitfalls that gobbled up her mother . Can she , like someone facing some sort of Pharaoh 's curse , escape Judy 's tragic des-tiny ? In her nightclub act you can hear audiences whispering of Judy as they watch her daughter . They nod knowingly when Liza reaches for a quavering high note , or arches her body and flings out her arms to finish a song , the way Judy did . They see Liza 's big , brown eyes , they hear her deep throaty sadness ; they feel her swallowing tears . What many of them have come looking for is not really Liza Minnelli , but some traces of Mama 's emotive genius and gesture ? that old rainbow magic . Liza is n't about to accept the role of echo . " I fight to be Liza Minnelli on stage and I fight to be Liza Minnelli off stage , " she says doggedly . " They 're trying to prove that history repeats itself , but Mama proved to me that it does n't have to . Watch my mistakes , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " These days Liza works at a killing pace , whether rehearsing or performing before nightclub audiences . Watching her , one begins to see how she satisfies her inner drives ? and her emotional needs . She comes off stage and drops into a chair in the wings , sweating like a prizefighter while her dresser mops her with a towel . Her costume is shucked off her like a single corn husk and she is thrust instantly into the next costume ; the drum rolls , she sucks a last drag from a cigarette and is propelled , bodily , back into the smoky glare . In seconds , as she sways and gyrates to a fast rock tune , the spotlighted beads of sweat are jumping from her head like chips of glass . Apparently , her hard work pays off handsomely . Liza is one of the highest paid and most respected young women in show business ? and one of the few remaining who follow a vaudevilletinged , song-and-dance routine . The Singer Company , which underwrote her September special , reportedly wants her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her regular round of nationwide appearances , a stint with Cabaret star Joel Grey at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas last month ? and it 's very possible that Grey will in some way join her supper-club act . A longtime dream has been to make a film with her father . and she has been toying with a nostalgic drama taken from a novel called The Last Flapper as a vehicle to focus on the merry , moody Roaring Twenties . Originally , Liza wanted to do the film  | with her father ( who is making a feature on the life of the great black blues singer , Bessie Smith ) based on the early life of Zelda Fitzgerald , author F. Scott 's gifted but troubled wife who died in a sanatorium . But she could not come to an agreement with the Fitzgeralds ' daughter , Scottie . Like another role she went after ? that of a young psychotic girl in a screen version of Hannah Green 's novel I Never Promised You a Rose Garden ( the movie was never made ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . I do n't want to talk about Zelda being crazy , " she says , " because that 's not what was so fascinating about her . She was chasing .. Life ! She wanted to do everything . She had incredible drive . She did n't give up . " Neither has Liza . Though she has been hunting for another story that would allow her to create a Zelda-like role , she still holding out for the real thing . It 's fairly obvious that Liza is lucky enough to be able to choose ? or even create ? parts that work almost like therapy in relation to her own life . Though she is quick to deny it , many of the songs she sings take on a highly personal quality of sounding like her own . One , by Sonny Bono , called You Better Sit Down , Kids , is about a parent telling the children about a divorce in the family . When Liza sings My Mammy , the old Al Jolson tune , people can not help thinking of Judy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her roster , It Was a Good Time , despite her denials , can be heard almost as a heartbreaking autobiography , with a special ache and reminder of a painful childhood that seems all her own . But whatever persona , whatever image Liza chooses to assume , she never faiIs to give it a high-voltage emotional joIt . " To see a character who has knowledge of pain and great capacity for joy is one of the great audience experiences , " says director Alan Pakulla of her work in The Sterile Cuckoo . " There are many things an actress can learn about control or technique , but the ability to create life in a character is something you have or you do n't . " Liza has it , in abundance . And for the moment , she has turned potential tragedy ? the legacy of Judy 's public adulation and its effect on her striferidden life ? into something positive . As of now she has escaped the curse ? by @# taking Judy 's watch-my-mistakes advice . Like any star who lives in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to weather some knocks . " I do n't enjoy getting hurt , " she says . " I do n't want to say that I 've lived a rough life , but I 've come through . I want to be able to say I 've made it easier along the way . " She adds , " You ca n't be self-destructive . You 're just not allowed . I 've been given a talent and it would be wrong of me to misuse it . " Her friend from childhood , Mia Farrow ( Liza is godmother to Mia 's twins by Andre Previn ) , stresses Liza 's strength : " There 's always someone who wants to explain Liza by pulling her out of Judy 's dead arms , but she 's nothing like Judy . She seems terribly vulnerable and she is ? you have to be when every moment is new . But Liza is strong . " Several years ago , after one of her nightclub performances , Liza came off stage and grabbed her friend , Gayle , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sound like her ? " she wanted to know . Now those days are gone . As Gayle puts it , " When Judy was alive , Liza was just the little girl . " Now she 's come into her own . More than most young women , Liza knows firsthand that life ca n't all be rainbows . " What works is being able to bounce back , " she says . " Resilience . That 's what does it . If you stop and think , nothing is as bad as it seems . In the worst moments , I 've always found that something funny is happening ? I mean , really fun ay funny . And for that I give my mother all the credit . . . . Then with lowered eyes she adds . " I guess what 's saddest are broken dreams . But they do leave room for new ones to come and take their place . " In that little aside , you can feel the presence of the embattled star who cried out to her daughter so many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
