txt The Carter Administration and the Chrysler Corporation said in a joint announcement today that the company would run out of cash by mid-January , even if Congress approved a Federal assistance package before the Christmas recess . Vice President Mondale said it was " essential that Congress act immediately " and pass the Chrysler aid bill " before the end of this session . " He called upon parties with a stake in Chrysler 's future to " get to work immediately to make the contributions necessary to tide the company over " while a complex Government-support rescue package was negotiated . Mr. Mondale told reporters at the White House , " On behalf of the President , I urge the Congress to act quickly and pass the Chrysler aid bill so that we can provide security for thousands and thousands of jobs and insure Chrysler 's long-term success as a major United States automotive producer . " Aid Faces Uphill Fight The announcement was made after reporters ' inquiries about a new internal assessment prepared by the company estimating that Chrysler will lose more than $400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , and $500 million next year , about $27 million more than projected . Senior Administration officials , who learned of the company 's revised loss projections only a few days ago , were known to be deeply concerned about the impact of the new estimates on the willingness of Congress to approve $1.5 billion in Federal loan guarantees for the company . These officials theorize that Congressmen would be unlikely to pass loan guarantees for a company they fear can not be saved . The legislation faces an uphill fight in both houses of Congress . In Detroit , Lee A. Iacocca , Chrysler 's chairman , attributed the need for immediate interim financing to " current softness in the economy and in the car // market . " He did not disclose the company 's new internal estimates in his statement . In a telephone interview , however , Mr. Iacocca confirmed that the company 's losses for 1979 and 1980 would be larger than expected , but said that the company would not go bankrupt if Congress approved a loan guarantee package before the Christmas recess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Iacocca said . " Everyone always knew , that we would have some difficult weeks in January , " said Mr. Iacocca , who had previously projected that the company would run out of cash without loan guarantees by Valentine 's Day . He conceded that the increased loss projections meant that the company would have to raise additional cash " a few weeks " sooner than anticipated , but said that the company had already planned for that contingency . Mr. Iacocca said that several options were being explored , among them asking suppliers for 15 days ' credit ; discussions with the United Automobile Workers about an emergency loan from the union ' , and a quick sale of assets . Specifically , Mr. Iacocca said that the company had already lined up prospective purchasers for two of Chrysler 's prized assets , and that the company could sell them immediately if it were necessary . " But Congress 's intent so far has been to make sure that the company does not have to sell off revenue-generating assets , " Mr. Iacocca said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flexible enough . ' Aid from Interested Parties The House and Senate bills both require that all parties with a stake in Chrysler 's future ? banks , suppliers , dealers , city and state governments , and the auto workers ' union ? make cash contributions to the company that equal or exceed the amount of the Federal guarantees before Chrysler is eligible for any Federal assistance . The company and Administration have acknowledged that the assembly of these commitments would probably require several months of difficult negotiations among the parties . Some officials are known to fear that if the legislation is not sufficiently flexible , the Administration might not be able to assemble the financing package at all . Chrysler 's bankers , for example , have told the Administration and legislators that unless the Government waives its first claim . on Chrysler assets in the event of a bankruptcy , banks would probably be unwilling to extend new credit to the company , even if Congress approved the guarantees . A provision that bars the Government from waiving its senior credit status is contained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for comment on the Vice President 's lateafternoon announcement . However , Howard G. Paster , legislative director of the U.A.W. , discouraged the company from seeking emergency shortterm financing from the union . " I do n't know how we could give any short-term financing , " said Mr. Paster , who said that the only large reservoir of funds was the company strike fund , and that the union 's constitution would not permit its use for this purpose
