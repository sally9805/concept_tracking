THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment The Federal Government must come to the financial rescue of New York City and New York State without further delay unless the nation is to be plunged into the most catastrophic economic debacle in history . I have been personally involved in every American panic since 1893 , when  - -  From a recent letter to the Times by Cyrus S. Eaton . " I ' M perhaps the only living man who was personally and profoundly affected by the Depression of 1893 , not to mention those of 1907 and 1929 , and I do n't want to spend my last years being affected by another big one , brought on by the default of New York City , " Mr. Eaton , who will observe his ninety-second birthday next month , told us when we called on him the other morning on his farm outside Cleveland , where the man who practically invented d  --  tente has on modest display , along with other mementos of an extraordinary life , a Lenin Peace Prize . " In 1893 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace , and my father , who was doing quite well in farming and lumbering and general merchandise , was about to move down to the States and join his brother Cyrus , for whom I was named , in the tin-plate business . Then the panic hit . Suddenly the American dollar was worth only fifty cents in Nova Scotia . My prudent father decided not to take a chance on a country in that kind of shape . We had a special interest in that depression up there because , as you doubtless recall , one of Grover Cleveland 's ancestors had some Nova Scotia in Es background . Poor Cleveland ! That depression lasted all through his second Administration , and it was one of those economic catastrophes that are due less to any basic weakness in the nation than to the stupidity of statesmen . I was only ten years old at the time , but I had been interested in my father 's business for quite a while . I had begun taking on responsibilities when I was four , and used to get on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn to the brook . At five , I milked my first cow , though I must confess she was so good-natured my father said any idiot could manage her . At six , I got a job fetching water from a spring for some men who were laying railroad tracks nearby . I was paid fifty cents for a ten-hour day . My father was also the local postmaster , so next I began sorting the mail . Even before that , I had been looking at the Boston and Providence papers that came in to our Pugwash subscribers . As soon as I learned how to read , I began reading American newspapers  --  a very had habit , which I still have . I have recently found myself more attracted , however , to Leibnitz , and Plutarch 's ' Life of Lycurgus . ' " Mr. Eaton turned back to the plight of New York . " You 're suffering because of the whole national economy , " he said . " Here 's the greatest city we have , on the verge of collapse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system of life on remote countries like Cambodia . Mrs. Eaton and I have been to Cambodia . It used to he one of the most beautiful countries on earth . If New York goes , people all over the world will panic . I 've been working quietly on your problem with some senators and congressmen , and I 've exchanged some ideas with Nelson Rockefeller , whom I 've known since he was two . An able young man , Nelson , with no temptation to do anything dishonest financially . His paternal grandfather took care of that . I knew both his grandfathers well . When I first came to the United States , at the turn of the century , it was the summer I 'd finished prep school . I was visiting my father 's younger brother , who was pastor of Mr. John Rockefeller 's church in Cleveland . That 's John I ) . , Senior , of course . When I checked in at my hotel , I saw a big sign saying that a night clerk was wanted , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Rockefellers ' for dinner , and when Mrs. Rockefeller asked what I was doing and I said I had just landed a fine summer job as a night clerk , she said , ' Oh , that 's no job for someone like you ! John , ca n't you do something for this young man ? ' He more or less had to offer me a job . I did n't know if the hotel could survive without me , so I demurred until I could ask the manager , and when I did , he said , ' You take it . If it were offered to me , I 'd take it . ' Mr. Eaton , a trim nonagenarian with snow-white hair and a ruddy complexion , was rather formally dressed in a dark-blue double-breasted suit , white shirt , gray tie , and highly polished black shoes . He said he had to fly to Baltimore that afternoon for a railroad meeting ( he is chairman emeritus of the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway ) , but expected to be back home for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm hound to say its bankruptcy was the greatest economic disaster in recent years , " he told us . " The Penn Central was a marvellous property , and it could have survived if the cost of borrowing money had n't been driven up so high because the government was spending it all over the world , on armaments , like a drunken sailor , If New York suffers the same fate as the Penn Central , you may never recover from it . Until lately , I went to my office , downtown , every day from eight to five , but now I generally come home at two , so I can walk around the farm . I 'm mainly a farmer and a philosopher at present . You might say that I 'm not technically qualified to use that ' philosopher , ' but I do spend a great deal of time thinking about big problems . In any event , I 'm in good health  --  though when you get to he my age your hearing 's apt to he not so keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked in with them , ' We ca n't see any end to you under a hundred . ' The reason may be that for nearly fifty years I 've been strictly adhering to a set of rules that the doctor who prescribed them said he would n't dream of observing himself : no tobacco , no alcohol , no tea , no coffee , and none of those indigestibles , like corned-beef hash . No corned-heel hash ! ft used to he my favorite . I played tennis up to a few years ago , but I quit it about the same time I quit skiing , having been persuaded to do so when the doctors said , ' At your age , if you break a leg we ca n't repair it for you . ' " Mr. Eaton paused for a sip of orange juice . " By the way , I have family ties to New York City , " he went on . " My Eaton ancestors were all New Englanders who went to Canada before the Revolution . My mother , though , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who remained loyal to England and , after the surrender at Yorktown , were treated very roughly . Everything they owned was confiscated , and they were expelled to Nova Scotia . It was a little scar on American history . They were given a thousand acres at Pugwash in forced exchange for a substantial piece of property at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street . You know , this is a vast country , with enormous resources . But these panic spells , which are to so large an extent emotional , can be terribly destructive . If the greatest city in the world collapsed , it would he an awful blow to the capitalistic system . There 's no perfect system anywhere , but generally I 'm in favor of capitalism . As a philosopher , moreover , I try to look at the pros and cons of questions , and I 've come to believe in compromise and moderation , which ould n't he a very good philosophy , of course , on which to run for political office . NVell , I 'm not a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and anybody who feels that way ought to be concerned about the financial soundness of a city as big as New York . With so many cultures and nationalities represented among your eight million people , New York is a tremendous experiment in modern so ciety , and the rest of the country has got to take it seriously . " ? ? Opening WE have a note from a young student of nightlife who went to Peggy Lee 's opening at the Empire Room : Just now I am feeling very severe , because the big old night clubs in the big hotels are so foolish about the people who want to go to the big old night clubs in the big hotels . There are a number of us who have seen Novella Nelson at Reno Sweeney just about as many times as anyone could possibly do a thing like that , and we 're ready to move hack uptown , but when you get back uptown to a place like the Empire Room what you find is that the Empire Room has decided to take a tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. William Rhinelander Stewart ( for instance ) sitting at generous round tables looking at a floor show in a night club , so I know it is not necessary to have horrible long thin tables stretching from the stage toward the hack of the room angled in such a way that you get a crick in the neck looking at what you 're paying to look at . Also , I know perfectly well that the Empire Room used to he the Sert Room , and that the real Empire Room was across the way . Opening night for Peggy Lee , there was no black tie , no nothing . Well , that 's not right  --  there was Peggy Lee . The Empire Room was dressed up in an unsuccessful pastel . Peggy Lee was dressed up in a completely successful pastel . I liked her right away . She was in control , as they say . At Reno Sweeney , everything gets too chummy , in a way . Peggy Lee was n't chummy at all . She was , as I have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lighting man  --  she made a soft , subtle gesture with her hands and the lighting changed its gait . I liked Peggy Lee 's forehead . It was just high enough . She was in complete control of her forehead . Also of her hair and her pearls and her shade of peach . I wish she were in control of the tables at the Empire Room ; I bet they would he big and generous and I bet they would he set up so that you would n't get a crick in your neck . TO 01 . ) R. READERS With this issue , the newsstand price of The New Yorker is raised to seventy-five cents . Peggy Lee sang a lot of songs by Jerry Leiher and Mike Stoller , in a mode that I think they call bittersweet . Bittersweet with Germanic overtones . Jerry Leiher and Mike Stoller wrote some of the songs I liked before I began going to Reno Sweeney . My favorite song by them used to be " Little Egypt , " which had these lines : She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phoenix , Arizona , Nineteen Forty-nine . " Which is pretty good . Leiber and Stoller are writing ironic monologues to this day  --  only now , as I say , they have Germanic overtones . Hope Hampton was sitting at the next table , which was nice , since I think she must have been at the night clubs with the big round tables . She wore enormous jewels and a white turban . Jule Styne , the composer , was there . After the show , he congratulated Jerry Leiber . " I loved those Kurt Weill things , " he said . " What did you do ? - Spend a year in Germany ? " " No , " Jerry Leiber said . " I spent twenty years with my mother . " It Must Be Something ASTORL9 PARK rests snugly along the Queens bank of the East River on a stretch of land below the Hell Gate railroad bridge and an arm of the Triborough Bridge . The park seems to have been inserted between the big bridges sort of parenthetically , and , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far-better-thanaverage place to spend an autumn morning  --  or , for that matter , an entire autumn day . It will he even better when the city gets around to fixing up the dozen or so concrete-and-woodenslat park benches which are now in fine shape except that they have no wooden slats . The seating-space shortage became mildly aggravated a few days ago when the eminent American sculptor Mark di Suvero arrived with a thirty-five-ton hydraulic crane and a four-man crew to lend " Victor 's Lament " to Astoria Park for a few months . " Victor 's Lament " ? one of fourteen di Suvero creations going up around the city as part of a show opening soon at the Whitney Museum  --  consists of eight tons of delicately balanced steel girders and cables , and it tends to attract crowds . At a height of twenty-eight feet , it is somewhat overshadowed by " For Lady Day , " a mammoth di Suvero that went up in Battery Park last month , but it should play well in Astoria . A hit before ten o'clock on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park were Tony Trezza , an ace crane handler , who has been operating the big machines or twenty years , and the Salamanca brothers , Aurelio and Mariano , who have no particular interest in " Victor 's Lament " except that they have lived next to Astoria Park for fifty-two years and take walks there every morning and afternoon . A few days earlier , working with the artist and his assistants , Mr. Trezza had helped to erect the base of the sculpture  - -  a tripod of girders with a long , vertically extended arm , atop which an L-shaped piece of welded girders had been attached . On this , the day of the final assembly , a huge V-shaped section of steel lay on the ground next to the crane , waiting to be shackled with cables to hang freely from the L. Mr. Trezza was n't sure what he was constructing , but he liked it , nevertheless . " If you can run this machine properly , you can do anything , " he told us . " I pour concrete , build buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is more delicate than most of the stuff I do . I 'm enjoying it . " Around ten o'clock , Doris C. Freedman , an advocate of public art and a consultant to the Whitney for the di Suvero exhibition , arrived on the scene with Charles Short , one of her assistants . As they began to walk toward the unfinished sculpture , Mr. Short said , " Boy , it just got here , and already it 's covered with graffiti ) " " No , that 's graffiti from Paris , " said Mrs. Freedman , apparently thinking that " Victor 's Lament " had been part of a di Suvero show that was held in the gardens of the Tuileries last spring . She soon recalled , however , that the sculpture had never seen Paris - it spent the past four years in a parking lot in Pasadena  --  and a close inspection revealed that the graffiti were pure Astoria originals . One said , " THIS WAS BUILT IN ASTORIA OCT. 6 , 1975 BY STEVE K. " Mrs. Freedman told Mr. Short that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh coats of paint during the exhibition run . As they discussed this and other details , a rented panel truck drove into the park and Mark di Suvero emerged with three young assistants : Matteo Martignoni , the artist 's nephew , who builds custom-made bicycle frames when he is n't occupied as a semi-pro steelworker ; Lowell McKegney , carpenter ; and Ted Sitting Crow , a " sculptor of sorts , " who , when he is n't working with Mr. di Suvero , lives in Chicago and assists another sculptor , John Henry . Milt- the crew unloaded boxes of large socket wrenches and buckets of bolts and shackles , Mr. di Suvero , a blond , bearded man dressed in an orange hard hat , a blue jump suit , and a loose-fittingleather jacket , inspected the sculpture and discovered that it had shifted slightly off its metal base . The men went to work quickly  --  first lifting the entire sculpture , and then attaching cables around the base to steady it  --  and , as the people who were now coming to the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaflets that identified the strange metal construction and explained what it was doing in Astoria . A gray-haired man who carried a tennis racquet and two green tennis balls that had long since lost their fuzz asked us what it was . " It 's a piece of abstract sculpture put here by the Whitney Museum , " we told him . " That man in the leather jacket , with the heard and the Icing blond hair , is the artist . " " Oh , " he said . " But what is it ? " " An old man in the park yesterday said that the base is a Chinese letter meaning ' My brains are loose . ' That 's because the L on top is lying down , " interjected a man standing nearby , who identified himself as Vlassis Rack-ages . " I 'm no artist , but if they put it here it must be something . If they would fix the benches , the people in the neighborhood would come to look at it . " " Well , it looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis racquet , and he walked away . Mr. Rackages did n't feel like arguing . He told us that he is a Greek immigrant who came to America in 1928 and has lived in Astoria since 1950 , which makes him , by some standards , a relative newcomer to the area . He used to own a Greek cafeteria in Manhattan , but he retired ten years ago and now spends much of his time in the park . He carried a Greek newspaper in the pocket of a gray topcoat , and although the weather was mild , he wore a brown tweed slouch hat and , underneath the topcoat , a shirt buttoned at the collar , two sweaters , and a light sports jacket . As we talked to him , a blond woman who had been standing and staring at the sculpture walked by with a Dalmatian . She smiled and nodded to Mr. Rackages . " Excuse me , " Mr. Rackages said . " Are you the bicycle lady ? " " Yes , I guess I am , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road . I gather I 'm something of a celebrity in Astoria Park , because I 'm Digby 's mistress and he runs alongside my bicycle when I ride it here . Some of the children have even started calling me Mrs. Digby . " " I see you here every morning , " said Mr. Rackages . " That 's because of Digby , " she said , and then , after a pause , " What do you think of our new piece of sculpture ? " " I 'm not quite sure , " Mr. Rack-ages said , in an apologetic tone . " To tell the truth , I am a Greek and I like the old art . They say that , you know , Picasso , he created art when he changed the way people looked and moved their eyes and mouths to different places . I like to see the eyes and the face the way they should be . " " In other words , you go for the classics . Praxiteles - that 's your idea of art ? " gei. , es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drummond then told Mr. Rackagcs that she had enjoyed talking with him , and asked him his name . " Rackages . Like ' packages , ' " he said . " Vlassis Rackages . But you may call me Bill . " As the day wore on , Mr. di Suvero alternately supervised the construction and worked on it . Several long steel cables had to he shackled at the top of the L and attached at the base . Complications developed now and then  --  such as when the steel threads on the cable turnbuckles , some of which had been spot-welded during a previous exhibition , had to he filed down . This wasted time that Mr. di Suvero had hoped to spend erecting another piece , " Lover , " in Flushing Meadow Park . At one point , Ted Sitting Crow and Lowell McKegney strained to fit a reluctant cable into the base . " Is this where it goes ? " Ted asked . " Check it ! Check it ! " said Mr. di Suvero . " Down here ? " Ted asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to me . Does n't it to you ? " " I do n't know , man . I never worked on this piece before . " " Well , you 're working on it now . " A few minutes before three o'clock , a crowd of about fifty people  --  some of them schoolchildren , some of them old folks  --  began to gather next to the crane , maintaining a respectful distance from the sculpture . When the machine lifted the final piece into the air , conversations ran to whether the cables would be able to hold the piece , how many neighborhood children would climb to the top and fall off , how much the crane operator pulls down a week , whether the young men working atop the sculpture  --  they were wearing new hard hats , and one of them had his hair in a ponytail  --  really knew what they were doing . Finally , the V was secured in place , leaving the skeptics a bit let down , and Mr. di Suvcro , who had watched the concluding steps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly toward " Victor 's Lament . " " When you first build one of these things , " Mr. di Suvcro told us , " vou never know quite how it will turn out until the piece is completed . But , of course , I know how this one works now . It requires knowing a lot of art and a lot of physics . I wish I knew more physics . " The people in the park said that the sculpture looked like many things : a bird ; a giant jack ; an insect ; very weird ; unfinished ; a woman with her legs crossed ; I do n't know ; a large toy ; and something that probably belonged in Manhattan . Out of the West ONALI ) REAGAN was in town One evening last week  --  he was the featured speaker at the thirteenth-an-niversary dinner of the Conservative Party of New York State , at the Amer-icana  --  and we went over to have a look at him . As he entered the Grand Ballroom , the Conservative Party faithful gave Mr. Reagan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered the room , and there were other standing ovations before and after his speech . If he decides to run for President , it is certain that the Conservative Pa rty will support him . This presents a poser for James Buckley , our junior United States senator . Mr. Buckley was elected to the Senate on the Conservative ticket five years ago  --  partly on the strength of his own excellent character but p:irtly because he had the tacit support of the Nixon Administration and because the electorate had trouble telling his opponents , Charles Goodell and Richard Ottinger , apart . If Mr. Buckle ) is to he reelected next year , though , he will need unstinting Republican support . If he kicks Mr. Reagan , a costly primary fight may be arranged for him by his old nemesis , Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller . ( The Conservative Party was founded to oppose Mr. Rockefeller 's supposed liberalism . ) On the other hand , if Mr. Buckley supports President Ford against Mr. Reagan , many Conservatives will he sorely disappointed in him . At the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective candidacy by ignoring it . Several speakers referred to Mr. Reagan as the next President of the United States , but Mr. Buckley was not among them . Fie contented himself with saying , in his plummy , intelligent voice , that Ron Reagan is the Rembrandt of politics . ( Mr. Buckley kept calling the guest of honor " Ron Reagan . " ) " I say that , " Mr. Buckley explained , " because Ron Reagan is as much an artist in his own chosen field of politics as Rembrandt was in his . " Apart from the standing ovations and the cheers when one or another speaker demanded that the government get off our hacks , the Conservatives were quieter than people usually are at political dinners . During the part of the dinner devoted to eating the food , the loudest sound was not the hum of conversation but the clink of hundreds of knives and forks on hundreds of plates . Many Conservatives found time to glance around at the decor of the Grand Ballroom , which features one of the largest expanses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative style of the Grand Ballroom and the rest of the Americana will be given a name , and examples of it will he traded by antique dealers . One of those who paid tribute to Mr. Reagan at the dinner was Perry Duryea , the leader of the Republican minority in the State Assembly . Referring to J. Daniel Mahoney , the chairman of the Conservative Party , who was seated at Mr : Reagan 's left , Mr. Duryea said , " I gather from your remarks that you hope that new swimming pool in the I.Vhite House is going to he used by someone other than the person it was planned for . Well , my question is : Can that man on your right swim ? And when is he going to get his feet wet ? " This reference to Mr. Reagan 's coyness about announcing his candidacy delighted the Conservatives , and it obscured the probability that when and if Mr. Reagan 's announcement comes , Mr. Duryea will be supporting President Ford . When it was Mr. Reagan 's turn to speak , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he called " Dan Duryea " ? an understandable mistake . The burden of Mr. Reagan 's remarks was that the government should get of our backs . He said that Washington bureaucrats favor cutting red tape  --  lengthwise . He said that many " Americans of stature , " including John Kenneth Galbraith , are " openly advocating Socialism as the solution to our problems . " Mr. Reagan said that his answer to Dr. Galbraith was the failure of the Soviet Union ? " where they have had almost sixty years to build a total Socialist-Communist society "  - -  to secure for its people the material blessings that have been achieved in the United States . He said that the United States would have to destroy fifty-nine million television sets if it wanted to be like the Soviet Union . ( The news that Socialism and Communism arc the same thing , as Mr. Reagan asserted , will startle many people in Moscow , Stockholm , and Lisbon , among other places . I " If we can bring the facts to the American people , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save us from chaos , " Mr. Reagan said . " They will choose freedom . They will keep their rendezvous with destiny . " Mr. Reagan , of course , started political life as a supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt . After his speech , Mr. Reagan was given a Bicentennial flag by Thomas Kaiser , the Americanism chairman of the Submarine Veterans of World War H. Mr. Kaiser seemed to speak for all his Conservative brothers and s:sters when he said to Mr. Reagan , " Governor , on behalf of me and my . family , I present this flag to an American that everyone here tonight is equally as proud as I am of . "
