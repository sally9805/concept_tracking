When Burroughs Corp . President Ray Macdonald recently spied a Dali lithograph of a bullfight hanging on an office wall , he jokingly ordered a secretary to paste the letters IBM over the head of the vanquished bull . For the normally straitlaced Macdonald , this was an unusual act . He may not be entitled to the matador 's highest accolade , the ears , but he is fighting an impressive battle . Macdonald took charge of the Detroit computer maker half a dozen years ago , when it ranked a distant eighth to IBM . Today Burroughs is up to the No. 4 position in terms of the number of computers installed , and in some respects it is higher than that . <P> Its salesmen last year wrote more orders for new computers than two of its larger rivals , Honeywell and Univac . It has the industry 's second highest profit margin , behind IBM , and on one front Burroughs is even advancing faster than IBM . In a strong market for computer stocks , Burroughs shares last week reached a new high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with a 17% increase in IBM 's shares . <P> Not bad for a company that has scarcely 5% of the domestic market . In an analysis of the industry , Arthur D. Little , management consultants , forecast last January that Burroughs " very likely " can raise its market share to between 7% and 9% in the next four years . One reason is its new machines . Burroughs has brought out a series of small computers that fill a link in its product line . These machines rent for about $1,500 a month , can be run by an office clerk , and are designed for small companies , branch banks and hospitals . Burroughs already has orders for 100 new computers . <P> The company has long made technically advanced and easy-to-use larger computers for an impressive list of customers , including General Motors , U.S. Steel and Barclays Bank . But its growth was limited because a large part of Burroughs ' marketing force was oriented to selling adding machines , the product that Accountant William Seward Burroughs started the company with in 1886 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul S. Mirabito says : " Twenty years ago , this was the most stodgy company in the world . It was run by a guy who had worked his way up from the toolroom . " <P> Macdonald , 59 , is different , having climbed through marketing . He joined the company in 1935 as a salesman and later ran its international sales division . To build a savvy computer marketing force , he recruited technicians from one of the company 's largest customers , the U.S. military . Today , Burroughs has 21,900 sales representatives drumming up business in 120 countries .
