How the Glad Tidings Were Transmitted By our Elders and Betters by Henry Fairlie and Timothy Dickinson May Need Time Birth of God Taken Seriously in Helena , Mont . HEW , HUD , Foresee Growth In Downtown Stables Presence of Shepherds Welcomed But Why Wise Men ? From the wire LONDON ( Reuters ) ? Her Majesty the Queen has sent the following message to Joseph : " My husband and I wish to extend through you our warmest congratulations to your wife on the birth of a new king in what must have been difficult circumstances for you both . We wish him a long and prosperous reign . " THE HOUSTON POST , December 29 JERUSALEM , Dec. 27 ( UPI ) ? Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , accompanied by pianist Peter Duchin , visited the Bethlehem Stable this morning at 10:35 , and stayed for 20 minutes . When she left , Mrs. Onassis , who was wearing a chlamys and blue jeans , said : " I thought the child looked divine .

She leaves tomorrow for Capri , where she will be joined by her sister , Lee Radziwill , and will open an exhibition of Dorian graffiti . Mrs. Onassis will return to Rome early in February where , at the invitation of the Emperor and God Augustus , she will open an exhibition of Lydian graffiti . Mr. Duchin said he had no comment on what he had seen . Joseph Kraft COMPETENCE OF TWELVE IN DOUBT ? PAPEETE , SAMOA ? In the opinion of most of those who are attending the crucial meetings of the Trilateral Commission here , too much attention is being given to the marginal aspects of the new developments in the Middle East . The carols that have so far been examined here concentrate for the most part on the fact that the messiah is a child , and that its mother is claimed by his supporters to be a woman . But it is not they who will formulate the economic policy for the region . For starters , the alleged father appears to be only a village carpenter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a Japanese economist here pointed out , and from which few wood products are exported . A regency therefore offers little hope . The only hope for a competent administration lies in the quality of the advisers whom the new king will eventually appoint . One of his advance men , John the Baptist , has said that he will bring in " new faces and fresh ideas , " but what we need is old faces and stale ideas . The rumors that the child king will choose , among his 12 top appointments , a local tax collector , two fishermen and perhaps more , a publican and even a sinner , are not regarded as encouraging here . Of all the new names that have so far been scouted , only one inspires any confidence : that of the financially experienced Judas Iscariot . As a Swedish member of the Trilateral Commission , who has made a good impression at this week 's meetings , put it to me : " I would trust Iscariot with my last 30 dollars . " From the wire ROME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that His Holiness would be unlikely to have any comment until after it was known what would happen at Easter . But meanwhile the Pope reminded Catholics throughout the world that the doctrines of the Church can not be modified to meet any event , however singular it may at first seem . Rowland Evans and Robert Novak TEAMSTERS GIVE CROSS FOR CHILD The attention that is being paid to the gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh , said to have been presented to the unauthorized Jewish messiah who has recently been born in what is undisputed Arab territory by three kings who hope thereby to confer some legitimacy on his claims , has obscured the greater significance for the future of another contribution that has been secretly offered . At a meeting behind closed doors at the Holiday Inn at Ctesipon , which had been arranged by John Connally , the praetor of the " Pharisees for Herod " committee , a representative of Local 587 of the Teamsters at Golgotha said that his union was willing to offer a cross for the child if it was thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be publicly regarded as a suitable educational gift for a carpenter 's son . There is growing suspicion in some quarters in Rome that this agreement may be partly explained by the earlier gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh . An aedile who asked not to be quoted said that there is some evidence that the transmission of the kings ' gifts through Joseph , whose role in the whole affair has not yet been explained , might be a way of laundering the contributions , so that they might then be secretly passed to John the Baptist . John is known to be a fanatical desert enemy of both the Pharisees and their allies , the Sadducees , who believe that any attempt on his part , in alliance with the Oriental kings , to proclaim the child the King of the Jews would lead in the end to a popular demand for his crucifixion . The offer of the Teamsters has given the assurance that , when the demand is made , a cross will be available to carry it out . THE WASHINGTON POST , December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Child 's Father Joseph Under Investigation for Tax Fraud Sally Quinn THE ODD COUPLE Joseph had asked me to meet him at the Stable in the middle of the morning . Some cattle were lowing in a corner , and I asked if they were Herefords . " Do n't ask me , " he said , " they came with the room . " And the sheep in the other corner ? " Do n't ask me that either , they came with the shepherds . " He nodded to the door , and out in the sunlight , I looked into his deep blue eyes , the eyes of a carpenter , and put the question he knew I had come to ask . " And the child ? " " Do n't ask me , " he answered as he gazed into the well by which we were sitting . " They say that it came from God . " He looked up at me , his eyes now as piercing as the gimlets that are the tools of his trade , and said as hesearched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answered that I understood that such things happened in even the best-regulated marriages , not that marriage is up my street , and he sighed : " But not like this , Sally , not like this .

Jack Anderson and Les Whitten BETHLEHEM BIRTH ALARMS US STEEL The birth that took place last week in the shed of a steel mill in Bethlehem , Pa. , is being linked by the FBI to the almost simultaneous birth of a Southern Baptist with whom the parents of the new king are closely associated . The FBI is particularly interested in the activities of a man whom one of its officers calls " the arch-agent Gabriel , " who predicted both births , and seems to have had the technical capacity then to make them occur ? in one case , without the assistance of a father . " Gabe comes from nowhere , and then disappears as he came , " said the officer , " and he always leaves behind him a child . The difficulty we have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man using the code-name Luke to a friend called Theophilus has been discovered by the FBI . From this it appears that the mother of the new king is known as Marian , and that her husband is called Jose . This narrows the search . From the wire PLAINS , Ga . ( AP ) ? When informed of the news from Palestine this morning , President-elect Carter asked : " Jesus Who ? " But at his Sunday School later , he said that , after the decision which it took a month ago , his church would exclude no one . Before getting into his car after the service he told the waiting crowd : " You can imagine how pleased I am that my message of peace and goodwill has already been adopted so far away . " James Reston REHABILITATING ANCIENT VIRTUES Unfortunately there do not seem to be many people left today who can recall the words of Marcus Tullius Cicero , the most far-seeing statesman of the past century , in his Catiline oration : 0 tempora ! 0 Mores ! What times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter who heard them when they were first uttered in that packed courtroom not so many years ago , and who was walking recently on the wintry slopes of Tuscany , contemplating the news from Palestine , they seemed more urgent than ever , a reminder of the days when Rome was made by then who consulted the gods , but did not bow to them . Only a month ago we were giving thanks as a nation for our own achievements . Our forefathers called it Thanksgiving because , literally understood , the phrase means giving thanks . But today we seem no longer able to be satisfied . A child has been born to a virgin in one of the provinces , where there have always been many unsavory cults , and we are enthralled , forgetting that our own founders , Romulus and Remus , were nourished by a she-wolf . Which miracle is greater ? ? We no longer seem to know .

FOR TIME BEING DESERT CAMP , NEAR BETHLEHEM ? Whatever the criticisms of Sen. Frank Church and other liberals at home , no one here doubts that the Defeat of the Innocents was a success as a military operation , and that it saved more lives than it cost . This reporter dined with some of the officers before they left on their mission . They were bronzed and relaxed , their tunics open , their swords by their sides , and were strengthened by that comradeship in arms which is known only to men who are about to go out together on a dangerous assignment . Except for some peacock 's tongues sent by the Procurator , the food was only that of the desert , but to this reporter the Falernian wine seemed to have travelled unexpectedly well . The night was already dark as the men made a quick offering to the di penates , buckled their tunics , felt the edges of their swords , and left their tents . One of them looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and 10,000 babies down here , " he said . " How are we meant to know which is the right star , and which is the right baby ? " He spoke as a professional soldier of the unpleasantness of his task , which had nevertheless to be done ; and done cleanly . They returned at dawn , weary from drawing their swords . But the Pax Romana had been saved in this area from the threat of an unknown child . They spoke little of their mission as they unbuckled their tunics . From the wire WASHINGTON , D.C. ( AP ) ? President Gerald Ford announced this morning that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will leave Tripolitania today by camel to go to Judaea , where he was not expected until next February . The President said that Kissinger would assure the new king that the United States shared his hopes for peace on earth and goodwill among men , and would also meet Herod to reaffirm the continuing support of the United States for his policies .

Walter Lippmann DIVINE INTERVENTION IMPRUDENT AGAIN It has not escaped the notice of men that the problems which God has undertaken to solve , by his sudden appearances in the world , have in fact been of his own creation . He laid out his plan in Genesis , and he is always trying to remake it . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can not be surprised if his wisdom is now seriously called in question by his decision to intervene arbitrarily in one of the most disturbed regions of the world . Even if the method of his intervention had been conventional , it is hard to see how it could have contributed to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East . But to choose a woman and a child as his instruments must seem in the present condition to be the height of imprudence . We did not criticize God at the time for creating the world , although it could have been argued even then that it would have been better if he had not chosen to act alone . But it was assumed that , when he saw that his creation was good , as he himself put it with the exaggeration which has always marked most of his pronouncements , he would withdraw from it . Instead he rested for only one day , and since then his interference in the affairs of men has been frequent and unpredictable . He has usually delivered his ultimatums from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere is thin , and is known to encourage delusions in most people .

Achaemenid bimettalism was really a more workable policy , but Alexander of course used his brief time to change it . It is now too late to be seriously exercised about the problem , although one should not underestimate the ability of some people still to get aroused . We are now told that there is a choice between Christ and Mithras . Perhaps there is , but who today can discern it ? Mithras would be overrated , if anyone thought about him at all . But who does ? To go down into a cave with some of the boys , sacrifice a bull ; and do things too secret to tell in the dark , is hardly a claim to anyone 's attention for long .

The system seems to require a prophet every century or so , no matter where he comes from , with plenty of publicity each time , and some new notion that has been worked up for the times . No doubt Christ will be crucified , the thing has been tried before , and then there will be another 50 years of bleeding hearts . They may even set up crosses all over the place this time , and manufacture them for people to wear . When one returns to the Aeneid , as I did only the other week , the underworld is just the same as now , and will always be .

" John Kenneth Galbraith , from Procurator 's Journal . December 26 .. Awake again most of the night , with the pains that seem to pester me more as each year passes . My digestion needs a mollifying regimen , which Octavian knew well enough when he chose to send me to this godforsaken spot . When I cabled my mild complaint to him again yesterday , he sent back the reply : " Are you sure that it is still godforsaken after today 's news ? " He signed himself " Augustus Caesar , " which he always does when I ask some consideration . . . . Does this mean that State is getting excited by the rumors from Galilee , in spite of my persistent requests that they ought to be disregarded . If only those to whom Octavian listens in Washington spent as much time as I in receiving the natives here , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was begat by Jesse , who was begat by Obed , who was begat by Booz , who was begat by Salmon . I know the genealogy by rote now , and what can be expected from such a line ? But such are the uncelebrated labors of a procurator in these times , and the officials with whom I am meant to cooperate are no better . As soon as the reports from Bethlehem began to circulate in the bazaars , Herod was in my chamber , requesting an audience , and holding forth as usual , even though he knows that my headaches have been particularly severe recently . The man is trying : whether by nature or not , I leave to Dr. Jensen ; although it has always occurred to me that there can not be a mechanical explanation of one 's own pre-eminence and that of a few of one 's colleagues . When I complained to Octavian some time ago about the inferior quality of the officials here , he replied in his next letter , which I had this morning : " Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked , what is the difference in your position now ? " He should spend a morning with Herod , whose subsidy from Rome is already larger than my own allowance , but who came here to ask for still more , and for men and arms as well . At least I go to Tyre next weekend , if I am able to travel .
