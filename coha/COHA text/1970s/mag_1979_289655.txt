LADYHOUSE BLUES by Kevin O'Morrison <P> Family plays rank among the finest and most durable achievements of the U.S. theater . Season after season , Long Day 's Journey into Night , Death of a Salesman and The Glass Menagerie are revived all over the globe . <P> Even a demonstrably lesser drama , such as Ladyhouse Blues at Manhattan 's Theater of St. Peter 's Church , shows the deep affinity linking the family with the emotions and experiences that fire up a stage . Within the family-sometimes at scalding intensity-we get our first inklings of the nature of love , hate , time , memory , remorse and reconciliation . <P> Kevin O'Morrison displays an intuitive grasp of all this , and his Ladyhouse Blues is suffused with a contagious humanity . Mood , rather than action , dominates the evening , and the play is anchored with palpable authority in a St. <P> Louis neighborhood in 1919 . An Irish-American mother , on the lower rungs of the middle class , and her four daughters are sweating out an August vigil for the sole son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service in World War I. <P> <P> Spunk , verve , laughs , tears , death and God . <P> Only a telegram arrives . It informs the five women that the boy has died of cholera . His body has been cremated . <P> A sparse plot , downright anemic ; yet O'Morrison fleshes it out with the wondrous detail of bygone commonplaces . In this household , light comes from kerosene , refrigeration from an iceman , fruits and vegetables are preserved and the tele phone and vacuum cleaner are wild rumors . It is a simpler world but not a qui eter one . The women fuss and explode over trifles , then sing together in tranquilizing harmony . <P> O'Morrison 's limber dialogue reveals character by indirection . One daughter ( Laurie Kennedy ) , ill with tuberculosis , has been barred from seeing her husband and child . Another ( Jobeth Williams ) is held in waning esteem by her New York socialite husband and is downing one glass too many . The youngest ( Christine Estabrook ) , a girl of vim and verve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of this Irish brood regard as scarcely preferable to acquiring head lice . <P> The mother , Liz , played by Jo Henderson with skill , zest and daring , is rather like the father in " Da , " a character who follows you right out of the theater . <P> She is spunky , bluntly xenophobic , untutored in books but knowing in the ways of the world , and possessed of a hot line to God , in whom she puts the unwavering trust of an early Christian . <P> There are a trifle too many Chekhovian tableaux artily arranged by Director Tony Giordano - these are distinctly not those " sisters " - but Ladyhouse Blues is the sort of play Chekhov might have liked .
