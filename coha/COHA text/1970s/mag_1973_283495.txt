Four years ago , in the affluent suburbs west of Boston , the freshmen at Lincoln-Sudbury High School had passionate causes . They marched against the Viet Nam War and rallied on Lincoln green to denounce President Nixon . <P> Now , as seniors , they are chiefly concerned with getting their homework out of the way and whiling away the days until graduation . On sunny afternoons , they lounge on the school 's smoking patio , and when they talk about their hopes for the future , they use words like " comfortable " and " secure . " For entertainment , they drive their shiny new cars to Michael 's in nearby Concord for pizza and beer . Their worries , says History Teacher Don Gould , are as old as adolescence : " Whether people like them , what they look like , and who 's going out with whom . " <P> The class of ' 73 at Lincoln-Sudbury is typical . From city ghettos to prosperous suburbs and small towns , a new mood has settled on this year 's graduating class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers of the 1960s , few of them think that their generation will right America 's wrongs . <P> Instead , they have turned inward , worrying primarily about what kind of people they will become . They are more conventional than their predecessors , according to a series of interviews conducted by TIME correspondents across the country . They are also , at the same time , more materialistic and more religious . Some glimpses of this year 's graduating class : <P> &gt; " My goal is to be happy , " says Mike Tulumello , 18 , who edited the student newspaper at McClintock High School in Tempe , Ariz . He worked part time as a waiter in a local restaurant and graduated with B plus grades . " To be happy you need to be a success . I want to reach the top , to have a job that pays well , to own a car and to live in a nice apartment . " Next fall he plans to enroll in Arizona State to prepare for a career in broadcasting . <P> &gt; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , " declares Al Harris , 18 , a black member of the graduating class at Evanston ( Ill . ) Township High School . For him , that means studying electronics at a vocational school . He explains : " A few years ago , the majority of people really did n't know what they wanted when they got out of school . So they 'd go to college and major in anything-say , physical education-just to get a degree . That 's not for me . " <P> &gt; " I 'll tell you what we talk about when we get together , " says Andrea Heizberg , 16 , a senior at Midwood High School in a middle-class section of Brooklyn . " We talk about college , because that is where we are going . We talk about money , because you ca n't do anything unless you have it , and we talk about the opposite sex-always . Sometimes we talk about books . "
