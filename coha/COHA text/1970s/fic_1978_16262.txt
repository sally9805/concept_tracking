CREDITS 1 EXT . ASSEMBLY PLANT - DAY The low-lying buildings of an auto plant squat in a drab Midwestern suburb . The painted sign , stretching across the buildings , reads : " Home on Wheels Assembly Plant , Dearborn , Michigan . " Behind the sign , a digital sign proclaims : " 1977 Production Total : 265,542 .

ASSEMBLY PLANT - DAY We track down the assembly line : The goddamn line . Fifty-five cars an hour , 4,400 cars a week , 220,000 cars a year . Two shifts a day , 8 hours a shift , plus 90 minutes for lunch , 46 minutes to drink a coke or take a piss . All along the line , men work silently and monotonously . Hard young black faces . Sweating old white faces . Men with Afros and crewcuts , plain-faced women with out-dated hairdos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take-home pay $150.00 a week , with overtime , $9,000 a year . Moving , moving . Overhead " mules " lower car frames onto the line . The staccato sound of power wrenches and power-drills attached to long electric cords . Metal parts pushed into place  --  panels , fenders , roofs , hoods , floor pans . Machinery moving , forklifts unloading , welding irons sparkling . And the brilliant colors : sunflower yellow , glacial blue , cranberry red , sandlewood , pewter , lime , gold . A middle-aged man pounds at a soft drink machine , curses and runs back to the line . And the noise . Always the relentless pounding of heavy machinery . Bo Diddley 's twanging notes are backed by the beat of metal presses . His raspy voice belts out :  --  3  --  Now when I went to school , I stop and went in , Now I 'm a man , baby , Standin amongst men . Man ... 500% more man , Man ... CUT TO : 3 EXT .
