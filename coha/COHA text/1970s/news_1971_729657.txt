txt Peacemaking for Ulster may at last be picking up some slight momentum Even as British parliamentarians , heard Thursday that they would have an opportunity to air their views on the troubled province at a special debate in the House of Commons Sept. 22-23 , several new gestures of conciliation were made . Most significantly , Irish Republic Prime Minister Jack Lynch has apparently backpedaled on his initial refusal of tripartite tzlks on Northern Ireland among London , Dublin , and Belfast At the same time . the Ulster opposition has softened its initial outright rejection of British Government plans for community peace talks And British Labour Party leader Harold Wilson has put forward new ideas on implementing reforms within Ulster But terrorist bombing and sniping continues unabated in Ulster . And it remains an open question whether these new signs of political movement can lead toward some cooperative undercutting of the current violence . // *Soft gestures of conciliation on Northern Ireland build // After a slight tiff with the British over precisely what was said at this week 's talks with British Prime Minister Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference was proposed and that he will " consider the offer seriously . " Only hours before , Mr. Lynch had said he would participate only in quadrapartite talks , involving Dublin and London together with Unionist majority and Opposition minority representatives from Ulster . Faulkner holds key Ulster Prime Minister Brian Faulkner 's role is key to this delicate haggling over who joins in to talk about Northern Ireland 's troubles . Mr. Lynch , before Sept. 8 , said he would join Mr. Heath and Mr. Faulkner only if the latter participated as Unionist Party Leader , not Ulster Prime Minister . Mr. Lynch has carefully maintained the Dublin hard line that Northern Ireland is not tied to the United Kingdom but is an orphaned part of an all-island Irish Republic If Mr. Lynch , now , is prepared to join the other two men , all wearing prime ministerial hats , a breakthrough-softening of the Irish Republican stance may be indicated . At least , the Lynch consideration of a tripartite meeting is the first positive result of the Heath-Lynch talks . It modifies the air of intransigence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Wilson 's 21-point plan Meanwhile , British Opposition leader Harold Wilson , Sept. 8 , put forward a 12-point Ulster plan to shift a share of authority for reform in Northern Ireland from Stormont to Westminster . Mr. Wilson demanded the recall of Parliament ( not due to resume until Oct. 18 ) to consider the plan . The Conservative Cabinet 's decision to accede to his request seems to be yet another conciliatory gesture . Mr Heath previously had refused earlier calls from Mr. Wilson for such a debate , although the Prime Minister had added that he would keep the suggestion under consideration . The Wilson plan is to set up a parliamentary commission composed of equal numbers of MPs from Stormant and Westminster They would study all proposed Stormont legislation , would be empowered to propose new laws to both Stormont and Westminster , and would report annually on the province 's taxes , finances , and spending . Adequate safeguards " What is needed in order to redress the balance in Northern Ireland in terms of human rights and human lives , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , to provide not Westminster rule , but adequate safeguards for all the people of Northern Ireland , safeguards guaranteed and made effective by the Parliament at Westminster . " Meanwhile , several groups in the province agreed to the round-table community peace talks proposed this week by Home Secretary Reginald Maudling . The Northern Ireland Labour Party , the Trades Union Congress of Northern Ireland , and the Alliance Party said they would be willing to come to London to confer . Rejection softened And , significantly , the initial rejection of such consultations by the Social Democratic and Labour Party , softened Sept. 8 Party leader Gerry Fitt , a Stormont MP , said : " We will give very serious consideration to any proposals that will end the violence . " Even actor Peter Sellers has grabbed a part on the Ulster scene . He turned up Sept. 8 in cross-legged meditation on the steps of the Ulster Parliament at Stormont . With his yoga teacher Swami Vishnu , he sang peace chants , flung peace leaflets over Belfast from a private plane , and even visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an appeal for law and order .
