txt Rhodesia now faces the prospect of a serious and tragic intensification of the racial conflict following Prime Minister Ian Smith 's rejection of British proposals for an interim government . The rejection means the collapse of British efforts to get the stalled Geneva conference on Rhodesia going again . ? British negotiator Ivor Richard announced the breakdown of the settlement talks after a 40-minute meeting with Mr. Smith here Jan. 24 . Terming this " a tragic and fateful decision , " Mr. Richard said the Rhodesian Prime Min- ister " bears the heavy responsibility for what may now happen . " What seems bound to happen is this : Intensification of the guerrilla war bringing with it the danger that neighboring white-ruled South Africa and the black states of Botswana , Zambia , and Mozambique will become increasingly involved // From page 1 - *Rhodesia scene darkens Already there is a state of open hostility along the 600-mile border with Marxist-ruled Mozambique , which last year closed its frontier with Rhodesia . On the Western border there is increasing tension . The Rhodesian authorities have accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodesia military forces have on several occasions crossed into the country and has taken the issue to the UN Security Council . There also is evidence of tension on the northern border with Zambia , and inside the country guerrilla activity has taken place within 40 miles of Salisbury , the Rhodesian capital . Mr. Richard warned that , in addition to the guerrilla war , economic sanctions imposed by the UN after Rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence 11 years ago also will continue . And " the people of this country , both black and white , will suffer further , " he said . Two key issues now face Mr. Smith : 1 . He has to contain the war ? and most observers believe that barring substantial external involvement on the side of the guerrillas , Rhodesia 's whites can hold out for some time yet . 2 . He has to maintain white morale , now at its lowest level since 1965 , and convince his followers that there is a way out of the political stalemate . In a nationwide broadcast , Mr. Smith said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have imposed " a Marxist-indoctrinated government " on his country . But , Mr. Smith added , he was still ready to continue negotiating on the basis of the peace package put to him by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger last September . It was believed that he intended to repeal most of the country 's racial legislation and present this as evidence of his government 's willingness ? in spite of the failure of the Geneva conference ? to reach an agreement . At a later stage he is expected to open new settlement negotiations with tribal chiefs , whom the Rhodesian Government has long claimed are the true representatives of blacks . However , this week Mr. Richard made it clear that Britain would not accept any agreement reached in this way . He pointed out that it would be " very difficult to have a free election when at least two of the . possible candidates ( Robert Mugabe , joint leader of the militant Patriotic Front , and the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole , who claims to lead the Zimbabwe African . National Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landslide victory by one nationalist group would under such circumstances be no more than " a glorified Gallup poll . " Even the most moderate of the black groups , the African National Council led by Bishop Muzorewa , has turned down further negotiations with Mr. Smith unless he is prepared to " surrender power to the majority totally and unconditionally . " It is clear that Mr. Smith will do no such thing . The British proposals that Mr. Smith rejected were that a British commissioner would act as chairman both of a national security council comprising representatives of black and white groups and of a council of ministers with a black majority . Mr. Richard stressed that the " fine print " of the proposals would have been open to negotiation had the Rhodesian leader accepted them as a basis for a resumed Geneva conference . " The fact of the matter is that the African nationalist delegations accepted our proposals as the basis for discussion . They were prepared to sit around a table and negotiate . Mr. Smith apparently is not , " Mr. Richard said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
