Did San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto owe the state of Washington and various local authorities a refund of $2.3 million ? In court for 95 days since last October , lawyers and witnesses in Vancouver , Wash. , produced a total of 9,675 exhibits and an estimated 3,500,000 words of testimony and arguments on that question . Last week the jury somehow came to a decision after only 10 hours of deliberation . Their verdict : Alioto could keep the money . <P> It was by any measure a curious case . A highly successful antitrust lawyer in San Francisco before he became mayor , Alioto was asked in 1961 by the then Washington State attorney general , John O'Connell , to handle suits for triple damages against 24 electrical manufacturers that had conspired to fix prices at an improperly high level . Alioto was to be paid 15% of whatever he could recover , up to a maximum fee of $1,000,000 . He eventually got the manufacturers to pay $16.2 million to his clients-the state of Washington , three cities , one port authority and eight public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to lift the $1,000,000 ceiling on Alioto 's fee ; Alioto got $2.3 million . <P> Alioto had turned over $802,814 of his fee to O'Connell and O'Connell 's deputy , George Faler . Accused of conflict of interest , the attorney general responded that state officials have a right to practice law in their spare time . O'Connell said that he had worked on the case not only for the state but on behalf of his spare-time clients , the public utility districts . The fee from Alioto had been for that nonofficial work . Claiming that they had been unaware of all the Laocoon lawyering , the clients went to court to get the fees back . <P> " We felt the plaintiffs all knew that the fees were being shared and that the ceiling had come off , " said Jury Foreman Gilbert Scott . Moreover , " We thought that the plaintiffs got their money 's worth . " But the three are not yet home free . They now face a second trial on criminal counts . The Federal Government has charged them with conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee-splitting amounted to bribery of public officials .
