Alone , alone , all , all alone , <P> Alone on a wide , wide sea ! <P> - The Rime of the Ancient Mariner <P> Of the 55 sailors who started in the singlehanded transatlantic sailboat race a month ago , most were still alone , all alone last week , somewhere on the wide , wide sea between Plymouth , England , and Newport , R.I. They were still battling cold and cramp , waves and weariness ; still leary of sleep lest their untended craft be run down by a freighter or collide with an iceberg . They were still in danger of drifting aimlessly with broken equipment , or of being swept overboard with no help near . <P> Not Alain Colas . A handsome 28-year-old Frenchman with a Tahitian beauty as his fiancee and the sea as his mistress , Colas was ashore in Newport , sipping a heady mixture of champagne and acclaim . Colas ( pronounced Kola ) had crossed the finish line 20 days , 1 3 hours and 15 minutes after the start , for the fastest - by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrennial races held to date . In his ugly duckling of a boat , the 70-ft. by 35-ft. aluminum trimaran Pen Duick IV , Colas had averaged about 150 nautical miles a day for the 3,000-mile voyage , covering 260 miles in one 24-hour period . <P> Though Pen Duick had been one of the pre-race favorites , its progress during the crossing was largely unnoticed . For one thing , Colas 's radio was not always working ; for another , most fans followed rapturous reports on Vendredi 13 , a massive , three-masted schooner built specially for the event by American Designer Dick Carter , bankrolled by French Film Director Claude ( A Man and a Woman ) Lelouch , and sailed by Parisian Swinger Jean-Yves Terlain . By all accounts , Vendredi was well ahead and less than a day from Newport when Lelouch chartered a plane to add some footage to his proposed documentary on his boat 's victory , to be called A Man and a Boat . What he got instead was a stunning view of Pen Duick gliding across the finish off Brenton Reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by surprise . Many were relaxing at a cocktail party in a Newport mansion when Lelouch radioed back his discovery . Gin-and-tonics were hurriedly abandoned and the officials scurried to the Port O ' Call Marina for an unscheduled welcoming ceremony . After Colas docked , Newport Mayor Humphrey ( " Harp " ) Donnelly III popped a bottle of New York champagne and proposed a toast . Colas politely drank the offering , then ducked into Pen Duick 's cabin to produce a magnum of Taittinger . Obviously , nearly three weeks at sea had not affected the Frenchman 's palate . <P> In fact , Colas 's provisions for the trip included a variety of French delicacies ; farmers from his native Normandy provided Camembert , Pont l'Evque and Livarot cheeses , pt , tripe la mode de Caen and a supply of Calvados . Even so , the voyage was no pleasure cruise . Pen Duick 's living quarters are so cramped that even 5-ft. 6-in . Colas had to cook almost doubled up over a low stove . But that was a small , familiar drawback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape of Good Hope to Brittany-a nonstop journey of 10,000 miles . Other jaunts included Australia to Tahiti ( after Colas quit his job as a French lecturer at the University of Sydney ) and Tahiti to Mauritius ( with his fiance , Teura Krause ) .
