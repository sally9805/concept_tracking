txt Soviet Georgians , a fiery people who ca n't resist an automobile any more than a beautiful woman , are ogling a sleek Lincoln Continental these days , and it 's likely to be love at first sight . The American " beauty " is one of three cars featured in the exhibit " Research and Development ? U.S.A. " which opened in the southern Georgian capital of Tbilisi Monday . Among other products apt to bedazzle the local Soviet citizenry are a snowmobile , a Univac 9300 computer system , laser devices , latest-model telephones , a toaster , and a vacuum cleaner . For space enthusiasts , there is also the Apollo 10 spacecraft and a prototype of the Apollo lunar rover . All in all , the American fair is one of the most sophisticated ever put on in the Soviet Union . To be shown in six Soviet cities over the next 11 months , the " R and D " exhibit signals a warming up of Soviet-American cultural relations . It and the Soviet art exhibi- tion now under way in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were postponed as a result of Soviet irritation over the anti-Soviet activities of Jewish extremists in the United States . With a Nixon visit to Moscow on the horizon , however , both sides have been repairing the ruptures in certain aspects of their cultural-exchange program . And despite the recent expulsion of a U.S. congressman from the Soviet Union , the mood in Georgia is reported as cordial . In an unusual step , Mr. Nixon sent a message of greetings to the Soviet people which was read at an opening ceremony in Tbilisi by presidential consultant Leonard Garment . " At this time , " said the President , " when the peoples of both our countries look forward with hope to improvement in our relations , it is more important than ever that we increase our knowledge and understanding of each other . " Exhibits such as this one and the excellent arts and crafts exhibit now touring the United States are among the best ways of approaching this goal , and I consider them a very important part of our cultural relations , " This sentiment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Agency , who was on hand in the Georgian capital to open the exhibit . Missing cars One sour note marred a completely auspicious opening , however . Three of the 17 railroad cars which transported the exhibit were lost or delayed somewhere between the Soviet border town of Chop and Tbilisi and did not arrive in time for the shipments to be mounted . As a result , in Georgia ' the U.S. exhibit is being shown in only one pavilion instead of two as originally planned . Staffed with Russian-speaking American guides , U.S. exhibits always have attracted enthusiastic crowds here . And since the subject of research and development has particular relevance in the Soviet Union ? which is vigorously trying to pull up its technologically lagging economy ? the current fair probably will prove extremely popular . In its entirety , the exhibit will display some 170 products of 24 American companies , including Bell Telephone , Eastman Kodak , and General Electric . It encompasses such fields as space research , information processing and retrieval , transportation , communication , and consumer goods .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
