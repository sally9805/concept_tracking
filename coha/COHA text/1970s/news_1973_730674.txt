Kerner and Isaacs took the verdict without flinching , but Kerner soon whispered to his attorney , Paul R. Connolly , " I want the jury polled . " But the judge already had started asking each juror if it was his verdict , and each said it was ; then all ? held up their hands to show there was no mistake . THE BULLETLIKE verdicts and the whole delivery was over in three minutes . Attorneys for Kerner and Isaacs asked for 30 days to file motions tor a new mai . - ine judge grantee weir request . Out of court , United States Atty . James IL Thompson said lie , will recommend prison sentences for both men . " I do n't think the evidence here warrants probation , not with the crimes committed here , ' he said . Kerner , the first U. S. Court of Appeals judge to be indicted , tried , and convicted in the 189-year history of the nation 's second highest court , avoided interviews after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three attorneys out thru the judge 's door of the courtroom , where he took a special elevator to his own chambers on the 27th floor of the building . OM LEAVE FROM HIS $12,500 a year post , Kerner is expected to appeal to a special panel of federal judges set up to hear reviews of his case and to the United States Supreme Court . He issued a statement from his chambers which read : " Despite the verdict of the jurors , at no time that I have held public office have I taken any advantage and I have always tried and I always made my judgments in consideration of the people I have served . " I have been in many battles in my life where life itself was at stake . This battle is even more important than life itself because it involves my reputation and honor which are dearer than life itself , and I intend to continue this battle . " Isaacs and his attorney , Warren Wolfson , stayed in the courtroom briefly before leaving thru the main door . Isaacs first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'd have to sit down and write my whole philosophy before I could answer that . " KERNER AND ISAACS were convicted of secretly purchasing racetrack stock In 1966 which had been offered to them in 1962 by Mrs. Marje Everett , former head of the Arlington Park and Washington Park racetracks , to gain favors Kerner could offer thru official actions such as signing racing bills . They bought the stock at bargain 1962 prices , in one instance paying $50,000 for stock valued at $300,000 at the time of purchase . A phony promissory note and phony Interest payments were used to make it appear they actually paid something on the stock before they acquired it in 1966 . They were convicted of conspiring with William S. Miller , former Illinois Racing Board chairman , Miss Faith , ' Miller 's private secretary , and Joseph E. Knight , former stare director of financial institutions , to purchase the stock thru a complicated scheme in which the identities of Kerner and Isaacs swteorcek.shielded by the use of other names in transferring the ' Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to trial in return for Miller 's testimony and Miss 's help in locating documents the government was seeking to use as evidence . Knight was declared too old and too ill to stand trial . Checks used by Kerner to purchase the stock were funneled thru Isaacs ' bank account and Knight 's bank account , and in so doing the checks passed across state lines and moved thru the mail , making them guilty of interstate transportation in the furtherance of the conspiracy . THE INCOME TAX EVASION convictions resulted from the jury 's belief in the government 's contention that the racetrack stock profits were bribes and subject to tax as ordinary income . Kerner and Isaacs had claimed the right to take capital gains deductions , making the income taxable at a lower rate . Kerner was convicted of evading $87,000 in taxes and Isaacs $83,000 on their 1967 income tax returns . The actual amount of their tax liability will be much higher , said Samuel K. Skinner , assistant United States attorney , because the figure represents only the amount due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . Penalties and fraud percentages also have to be added ; Skinner said . Kerner and Isaacs were convicted of filing false tax returns in hiding racetrack stock under other names in their returns . Both men had . Chicago Harness Racing , Inc. , stock under the name " Chgo . Co . " Their Chicago Thoroughbred Enterprises , Inc. , stock was listed as " C. T. Co. " and Isaacs hid his as " Bajo . " KERNER WAS CONVICTED of perjury when he said he never discussed the allocation of racing dates with anyone while he was governor from 1961 thru mid-1968 , when he resigned to become a federal judge . Clyde Lee , general manager of the Egyptian Trotting Association , testified he discussed allocation of the association 's racing dates . Thomas Bradley , former Illinois Harness Racing Commission chairman , testified Kerner once gave him a direct order to change the Maywood Park Trotting Association dates and he refused . Kerner was convicted of making false statements when he told Oliver T. Stufflebeam and Robert Campbell of the IRS when they first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Co. " listed on his return was a financial company in which a good friend of his , Isadore Brown , was a director . Kerner denied several times he had Chicago Harness Racing stock , the agents testified . Kerner flatly denied their allegations on the witness stand and contended they lied when they testified they took notes in his presence . But the jury believed the agents , not Kerner , just as the jury believed Mrs. Everett , who first blew the whistle on Kerner . MILLER , THE MASTERMIND of the stock transactions , said Mrs. Everett wanted to " ingratiate herself on a continuing basis " with Kerner and Isaacs . Miller said be put direct bowledge of the scheme into the laps of the two men when he said he told them all about it Nov. 12 , 1962 , in Springfield after he received Mrs. Everett 's promise of stock in writing . ? - Thompson , at a press conference after the trial ended , said he was proud of the jury and proud of the " people who had the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness and tragedy about this case that scandal could reach a man the community sought for advice , " Thompson said . " Many people believe all politicians are crooked and all public officials are corrupt . " Kerner had the reputation of being different from all of that . I voted for him once . He had an outstanding reputation . It is ironic that corruption should reach such a man . " THOMPSON SAID he felt Judge Kerner should resign the bench but that It is a matter for Kerner to decide . Kerner bas a lifetime appointment , and can be forcibly removed only by impeachment brought in the U. S. House of Representatives and decided in the Senate . Kerner is unlikely to make any decision until his appeals are exhausted , which might not occur for six months . Kerner was the first judge in the 189-year history of the nation 's second highest court to be indicted , tried , and convicted .
