The Bicentennial may or may not be recalled as a year of great achievement for U.S. museums , but it has certainly nurtured some of their endemic ills . One of these is a manic itch to overdress exhibitions . It is highly contagious , and now sweeps through the Whitney Museum , whose big Bicentennial show , " 200 Years of American Sculpture , " opened this month . This is a historically complex and potentially important survey , involving seven curators , 345 works of art and a catalogue as thick as a phone book . But in order to secure impact , the Philadelphia pop architects Venturi &; Rauch were engaged to package it , while all seven curators-who chose the show 's contents-were locked out of the galleries during installation . <P> As a result , the presentation is ignorant , cluttered and coarse , and it trashes the sculpture . Works that need to be walked around and experienced in three dimensions are stranded on ledges and behind glass , so that they can only be seen frontally . When this is inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubist sculptures of John Storrs , an artist who should have been rehabilitated by the show , it borders on vandalism . Harsh blasts of light transmute rows of neoclassical and Victorian marbles into white soap . A group of David Smiths is gussied up with a 50-ft. photomural of what purports to be , but is not , the landscape around his studio at Bolton Landing . Such arbitrary window dressing annuls the difference between museums and show biz . <P> Does it matter ? Very much , because the enterprise is serious and several of the curators have done an exemplary job . Nobody attentive to American culture can leave the Whitney without having his or her ideas about sculpture in this country-its history , quality and social role-changed and stimulated . The first thing that strikes one is the prompt , and precipitous , decline of American sculpture after the arrival of the white man : until the late 19th century , the white tribes of America could produce nothing that came close to Indian art in vitality , beauty or density of meaning . The point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Anthropologist Norman Feder . <P> Thrones and Colossi . To move from the grand volumes and rhythmical , steely incision of these Tlingit house posts and Eskimo masks into the world of American neoclassical sculpture is to shift to provincialism . It is also to descend from necessity into sentiment , and , in a sense , from confidence into anxiety . Compared with the pressure of ritual meaning in the best Indian art , the search for a language of classical form and Roman gravitas conducted by the professionals who rose to commemorate the American ideal after the Revolution-Horatio Greenough , Hiram Powers and Thomas Crawford-looks curiously wistful . Hiram Powers ' The Greek Slave was the first internationally famous work of art produced by an American ; when it toured the U.S. in 1847 it created a sensation and people queued to see it . Yet today , as one gazes on this chaste pastiche of the Medici Venus , it seems more an anthropological document and less a work of art than most Alaskan carvings . The problem , of course , is not that neoclassicism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unimpressive .
