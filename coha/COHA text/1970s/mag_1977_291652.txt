" The lobbyists have come out of the woodwork , " said Jimmy Carter with obvious anger last week . " Selfish special-interest groups , " he complained , were spreading " misinformation " about one of his pet projects : a new federal agency to guard consumer interests . The target of Carter 's angry words was none other than the U.S. business community , whose support he has been ardently seeking since he took office . Led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers , businessmen have mounted a lobbying campaign that may kill the agency 's chances . <P> Ralph Nader and other consumer advocates have fought since the late 1960s for an agency that would operate autonomously within the Government , representing the public interest by monitoring other departments , testifying at their hearings , petitioning them to change injurious regulations and challenging their adverse decisions in the courts ( TIME , April 18 ) .

The bill 's chances of passing the House are very much in doubt . Coming to the bill 's defense last week , Carter argued that it would cost only $15 million a year , v. $10.4 million for the 13 existing consumer offices . Said he : " It is a tiny amount , but very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposal as New York Democrat Benjamin Rosenthal has challenged the President 's arithmetic . The first year 's costs could be $25 million , and could rise in succeeding years . The consumer protection agency looks very much like an idea whose time has passed .
