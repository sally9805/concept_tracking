Never before in memory had so many notables with White House connections assembled under the same roof . Among the guests at the Women 's National Press Club 's 50th anniversary dinner at Washington 's Shoreham Hotel : Mamie Doud Eisenhower , 73 ; Mrs. Charles S. Robb , 26 , elder daughter of Lyndon Johnson ; Teddy and Joan Kennedy ; Mrs. James A. Hoisted , 64 , only daughter of Franklin D. Roosevelt ; Mrs. Richard T. Brigham ( Peggy-Ann Hoover ) , 44 , Herbert 's granddaughter . Also Alice Roosevelt Longworth , 86 , Theodore 's daughter-and Pat Nixon , who showed up with husband and family . <P> Off for a month 's vacation from the attentions of Rome 's paparazzi went Sophia Loren , 35 , with her husband , Italian Film Producer Carlo Ponti , and their 18-month-old son Cheepy ( C.P. Jr . ) . On the well-guarded Adriatic island of Yugoslavia 's President Tito , a longtime Loren friend , photographers will be no problem-though Cheepy 's language may cause some international complications . Since his father speaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nursemaid in German , the youngest Ponti communicates in a linguistic potpourri ( " Morgen acqua okay " - 'This morning the water is fine " ) . <P> <P> Who was the lady hiding her face behind a large black carpetbag ?

" <P> <P> The scene required the leading man to enter a boudoir where Actress Karen Black , 27 , reclined in a costume consisting of nothing but makeup . Absolutely not , said Johnny Cash , 38 , Nashville 's country-and-western singer , in Hollywood for his first starring film role in A Gunfight . " How could I do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . To spare Johnny that moral crisis , Karen 's topography was concealed . <P> #8729 ; " It 's hard to stay married 50 years , especially in Hollywood , " said the bride , 75 . Indeed , a golden anniversary is such a rare event that a sizable if elderly contingent of the film colony-among them John Wayne , 63 , and Pat O'Brien , 70 - were there to hear Film Director John Ford , 75 , and his Mary repeat the solemn vows that they first uttered half a century ago . What 's the secret ? Said John : " Keeping your mouth shut . " Said Mary : " Do n't believe anything you hear and do n't believe anything you see . " #8729 ;
