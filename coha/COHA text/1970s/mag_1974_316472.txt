MCI Communications Corp . seems like the last company likely to worry American Telephone and Telegraph Co . <P> AT &T,; which has $67 billion in assets , is the biggest of all corporate elephants ; by comparison , MCI , whose principal asset is a $64 million line of bank credit , is scarcely even a gnat . Yet MCI last week bested Ma Bell in a court test that , in the eyes of A T &; T officials , makes it a serious competitor . AT &T; Chairman John D. deButts is , in his own words , " marching up and down the land " complaining to business audiences about the unfairness of it all . <P> Both companies lease private long-distance phone lines to corporate , institutional and government clients . These " tie lines , " carrying voice and data , are the most profitable of Bell 's services , especially on the high-traffic routes between major cities . Until January 1972 , Bell had a monopoly on tie lines ; then MCI inaugurated a microwave relay network , offering the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines between Chicago and St. Louis cost around $2,500 a month ; five MCI lines cost between $95 and $255 a month less . <P> The Threat . <P> Bell officials protest that price competition is not only unjust , but also a threat to the entire monopoly system that has put telephones in 94% of American homes . Only by charging tieline customers somewhat more than the service actually costs to provide , they contend , can AT &T; hold down rates to users of its standard services . Federal regulators , they argue , should not permit its rates to be undercut by MCI , which has no obligation to maintain unprofitable service in rural communities , as Bell does . MCI executives reply simply that prices should reflect the cost of providing service : costly services should be expensive , and inexpensive services should be cheap . <P> What really exasperates Bell executives is that MCI plans to plug its long-distance customers into Bell 's local systems . An MCI client in New York will be able to list and use a Chicago telephone number without having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Chicagoans could call him in New York with Bell collecting only for the local service . AT &T; refused to provide that service , so MCI petitioned the federal district court in Philadelphia , and won . Had MCI lost , AT &T; could have nipped the growing competition in the bud : fewer clients would pay for MCI lines if they could phone only their own offices in other cities . AT &T; then attempted to delay further court orders that it grant MCI its services . Last week the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected A T &; T 's request . Bell plans to carry on the legal fight , but meanwhile , MCI-and at least two dozen similar tieline specialists-seem likely to grow into something more than gnats.
