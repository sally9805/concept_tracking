txt THE MAGNIFICENT Mile Is about to Oe hit by a Big Mac attack . The new 's at the northwest corner of Superior and Michigan will open ' ' within a month , " according to a spokesman for the chain . And though this probably does n't rank with the opening of Water Tower Place or the new Marriott or the old Water Tower surviving another bout with city planner , the new 's is significant for the North Michigan Avenue area . It is the first of the proliferating franchise food places to open right on the street . The others are off Michigan or part of a development . 'S HAS promised to do it all for its customers and for its neighbors , some of whom regarded the announcement that the Big Mac was coming with as much enthusiasm as they would have accorded the arrival of a gravel pit . Its cuisine may not be haute , but the outside and inside will be properly haughty . Even now , a curious passerby can see enough marble on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL BE rounded canopies Close-up with Dorothy Collin " like Saks " over the windows , said the spokesman , and the canopies will be brown to blend in with the beige marble and darker granite facings . There will be window planters complete with geraniums . Inside there will be sectional seating for 160 people and wood tables in four shades of brown , wood chairs , carpeting , in shades of light brown , dark brown , and black , and  --  get this , will you  --  fabric wall covering in natural shades . Also , naturally , there will be green plants . You ca n't have a restaurant these days without a rain forest . And there will be a skylight . " It will be elegant , " said the spokesman . " WE 'RE ALL HOPING It wo n't affect the prestige of the Avenue , " said a spokesman for the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association . " There has been a mixed reaction , " she said . " Soule of the prestigious retailers think it 's not a place that belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fast-food places . They can get something to eat that does n't cost $4 . " Though the new 's is the first of the fast-fooders to have its door actually open onto Michigan  --  which also has such chain stores as Gucci , Elizabeth Arden , and Tiffany  --  there are many other fast-food outlets just off or up from the Avenue . A WALKING TOUR of " Food Land " Tuesday showed that customers and employes are gobbling up Whoppers and Whalers , Moby Jacks and Big Macs , Arby 's Ham ' n Cheeses , and enough fries to sustain the potato futures market into the 21st Century . At the southern end of the Magnificent Mile is Burger King , technically not really on the Mile since it is south of the Chicago River . In the old London House , where you could once " make a date with a steak , " // Move over , Tiffany Big Mac 's coming soon // office workers were having tete a tetes with Whoppers . ' THERE were many young men , some of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy corner of Wacker and Michigan . There also were many women , young and older . But there were very few exeCutive-type men . One supposes they lean more toward the atmosphere of the Tavern Club across the street . ' Not that the Burger King atmosphere is all that bad if you have a high tolerance for plastic and brown . There are brown tables and walls and a rust rug ? plus green plants , of course . ONE MAN even brought his own brown bag , which contained yogurt . Across the river in River Plaza , which is west of Michigan , is a 's . White stalactite-like things hang from the ceiling and act as columns . There are red and white counters , red tables , and red and white booths . There is also a lot of silver  --  silver chairs , silver track lights , silver 's ashtrays . There is art , maybe . On one wall is a planetscape , heavy on the red . On another , more space art . There ' are also windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the customers were in their twenties and thirties , the generations who were brought up on fast food . But Franchise Food Central is in the area around Chicago and Michigan where customers incude not only shoppers and area employes , but students from Loyola . There is a Jack-in-the-Box , which was a - fast- food pioneer in the area ; Arby 's , and , some time in the future , there will be a Golden Bear . THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX is also heavily ' into brown and plants , but offers tacos and burritos in addition to the usual burgers . ; The Arby 's has several versions of its roast beef special and several sauces to go with them , including Horsey Sauce . Arby 's also has a different sort of decor . It was done by Stanley Tigerman , who recently won an award for designing a library on the Near South Side . The thing about the decor is it looks like the Pompidou art museum in Paris . Pipes and vents are not only exposed , but celebrated . Reds , yellows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Thank You " like every other franchise food 's garbage recepticles . They say " Trash . " THERE ARE . HOWEVER , a lot of plants And that Horsey Sauce . The Golden Bear is a hole in the ground at the moment , and the papa bears do n't want to reveal what it will look like quite yet . On Rush Street , around the corner , there used to be yet another franchise food place , Arthur Treacher 's . It sank , however . A Treacher 's executive said , " Obviously , it did n't make it . " Then there is the 's in Water Tower Place . 's spokesmen point to the Water Tower restaurant as evidence the fast-food places can draw more than the young , the not-so-rich , and those in a hurry . They tell of the ladies who come in , sit down , and wait for a waitress , but learn the ways of franchise food and come back for more . THE WATER TOWER Mellonald 's decor is strictly 1970s kitsch  --  wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an Amazon Indian feel right at home . Though the greater North Michigan Avenue folks hope the newest 's at Superior will satisfy the area 's appetite , other franchise food chains are looking for places to locate . Wendy 's toyed with the idea of taking the old London House location and then the store on the southeast corner of Ohio and Michigan , but decided the " rents were out of reach , " said a spokesman . " We are still very much interested . " Burger King has no current plans " to build on Michigan , but we are in a period of expansion and the area is not ruled out , " said a spokesman . If they do build , forget holding the lettuce . Hold the plants .
