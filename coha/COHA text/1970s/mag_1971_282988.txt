THE BETSY by Harold Robbins . 502 pages . Trident Press . $7.95 . <P> Yes , junk fans , it 's a mano a mano for novelists who are all thumbs . Two of the greatest schlockmeisters in the history of solid waste have just published novels about the auto industry . Arthur Hailey 's Wheels appeared at the beginning of the fall season ( TIME , Oct. 11 ) . Now comes Harold Robbins to gun down Hailey with-The Carburetors ! No , with The Betsy . <P> It is called that because a 91-year-old automotive pioneer named Loren Hardeman sees his great-granddaughter Betsy swimming naked one day , and this makes him think about cars , and he decides to come out of retirement , wrench control of his company from his stodgy grandson Loren 111 , and build a splendid new automobile to be called the Betsy . Cynics may mutter at this point that Robbins is the only North American still extant who confuses girls with sedans . But no ! Hailey 's novel also jubilates over the introduction of a new auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in the Bahamas , Robbins spends half of his time in Cannes , and neither man drives to work . <P> Anyway , old Hardeman hires a burnt-out race-car driver named Angelo Pe-rino to get the Betsy into production . It does not seem more than usually absurd that in due course Loren III becomes furious and hires crooks to sabotage his own firm . There is a lot of sex , much of it involving a lady test driver who combusts spontaneously whenever she hears the roar of an engine . <P> Despite the literary failings of Hailey 's and Robbins ' competing car novels , the awards committee will announce its selections : <P> Worst title : basically a standoff with a slight edge for Robbins . <P> Number of pages : Robbins , 502 to Hailey 's 374 . <P> Most sensitive writing : Robbins ' " giant shaft of white-hot steel " and " searing sheet of flame " far outclass Hailey 's modest " her heart beat faster . " <P> Most obsequious cuddling up to the auto industry : Hailey , who in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with a list of Detroit 's " lasting love stories which had weathered well , " and then adds , " There had been many outstanding second marriages , too-the Henry Fords , Ed Coles , Roy Chapins . . . " <P> Neatest reach for historical verisimilitude : Robbins , who in a flashback has Hardeman telephone Walter Reuther in 1937 to warn him that the Battle of the Overpass ( in which auto company goons beat up unsuspecting union organizers ) is about to occur .
