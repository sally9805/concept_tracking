The tools used by man to control his environment often contain unknown dangers . DDT , for example , was once heralded as the ultimate pesticide , then was deemed an insidious killer . Now the U.S. Government finds itself in court defending a newer pesticide called Mirex , which conservationists claim has toxic side effects . <P> The trouble was caused by the fire ant , an agricultural pest that entered the U.S. from South America about 50 years ago and is now considered a problem in most Southeastern states . The fire ant erects mounds on cleared land ; like natural tank traps , the mounds foul farm machinery . Worse , the ant has a stinging bite that plagues farmers and city dwellers and can even kill small animals . <P> Sledgehammer v. Gnat . The Department of Agriculture is trying to banish the fire ant . But its latest plan for doing it is under sharp attack by three conservationist groups-the Environmental Defense Fund , the National Wildlife Federation and CLEAN ( Committee for Leaving the Environment of America Natural ) . The Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait containing 1,350,000 lbs . of Mirex-a powerful chlorinated hydrocarbon-on 150 million acres of land in nine Southern states . In a suit filed in U.S. district court in Washington , D.C. , " on behalf of all citizens of the United States concerned with protecting the environment , " the conservationists seek to enjoin the ambitious twelve-year project on the grounds that it is unnecessary and dangerous . In effect , they say , it resembles the use of a sledgehammer to kill a gnat . <P> The plaintiffs ' greatest concern is that far too little is known about the impact of Mirex when applied on a massive scale over a period of years . They are unimpressed by Government reports that no adverse effects have appeared so far in Georgia , Florida and Mississippi , where Mirex has already been applied to 3,000,000 acres . <P> To back up their suit , the conservationists point out that the Department of Health , Education and Welfare lists the chemical as a cause of cancer in mice . The National Marine Fisheries Service has demonstrated that in laboratory sea water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conservationists also contend that the chemical will be discharged from aircraft on all surfaces that might be inhabited by fire ants , including streams , parks and playgrounds . As an alternative to airborne treatment , they suggest that the fire ant be curbed by spreading Mirex directly on the insects ' mounds . <P> The Justice Department has now issued a reply attacking the conservationists ' suit on strictly legal grounds . According to Justice , the plaintiffs have no legal right to bring suit against the Department of Agriculture , because it enjoys " sovereign immunity . " They also claim that the suit is premature , since the program has not yet been finally approved or funded . Furthermore , for a variety of technical reasons , it is impossible for the plaintiffs to claim that they represent " all citizens . . . " Therefore , Justice argues , the entire suit should be dismissed . <P>
