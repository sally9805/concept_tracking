New Orleans is perhaps the most raffish and rococo of American cities . Founded in 1718 , it learned its lusty , brawling ways under the flags of France and Spain before Thomas Jefferson made it part of the U.S. forever . Woven into the gaudy fabric of its history are the Gulf Coast pirate brothers Jean and Pierre Lafitte , Mississippi River bandits , brocade-vested card sharps , oleaginous carpetbaggers and the rich , rum-and-flesh pleasures of the French Quarter . The Italian migration brought the Mafia ; after the La Stella raid of 1966 in Queens County , N.Y. , police revealed that of the 13 Cosa Nostra figures present , four were from New Orleans . <P> That is the climate that nurtured Jim Garrison , the district attorney whose life and times have outstripped Mardi Gras and Basin Street as the most exotic feature of present-day New Orleans . Last week , after six weeks of perhaps the most bizarre trial since that of Alger Hiss , Garrison was acquitted of obstructing law enforcement by taking bribes to protect illegal gambling . The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perverse Populism . To understand Garrison 's acquittal , recent history must be reviewed . In 1967 Garrison tried to convict Clay Shaw , the onetime managing director of the city 's international trade mart , of conspiracy to murder John Kennedy . Using the shadiest of New Orleans street characters , he tried to link Shaw with Lee Harvey Oswald and another alleged conspirator , David Ferrie , a homosexual pilot . The trial nearly ruined Shaw , but he was found innocent in March 1969 . It was the only trial Garrison had conducted in his seven years in office . He looked ridiculous , and needed a scapegoat . <P> So Garrison , in a peculiar act of perverse populism , blamed Washington . He proclaimed that he was being persecuted for telling the truth about an enormous plot by the Federal Government , the Eastern press and the military-industrial complex that resulted in the assassinations not only of John Kennedy but Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. , as well as the shooting of George Wallace . <P> Just what these men had in common that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Garrison never made clear . But his yelpings set the stage for his own defense in an entirely different legal encounter . <P> Garrison had been involved in a running battle with the metropolitan crime commission of New Orleans over his refusal to crack down on organized gambling , specifically pinball-machine owners . Finally the Government intervened . Under the authority of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 , a Department of Justice strike force moved into New Orleans . <P> The Internal Revenue Service gave the force a ready weapon : Pershing Oliver Gervais , 53 , who was to be the Joseph Valachi of the Garrison prosecution . <P> The Government based its case on four of 55 tape recordings that Gervais , a onetime Garrison aide , had made during actual bribery payoffs to the district attorney . Gervais-corpulent , compulsively scatological , not educated but highly intelligent-had good reason to cooperate . He had left the Garrison office in 1965 to become a bail bondsman.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
