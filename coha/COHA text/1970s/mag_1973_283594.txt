Though born a Jew in Vienna 62 years ago , throughout most of his life urbane Bruno Kreisky has sought to sunder all links to Judaism . At an early age he declared himself an agnostic . His wife is a Protestant , and he had his two children baptized as Protestants . He bristles when he is referred to as a Jew , preferring to be called " of Jewish origin . " <P> Yet as a politician in **27;3795;TOOLONG Central Europe , Kreisky could hardly avoid being regarded as a Jew . During his successful campaign for Chancellor three years ago , the rightist People 's Party printed anti-Kreisky posters urging the electorate to vote for a " genuine Austrian . " Experts like University of Wisconsin Historian George L. Mosse , who contend that Austria remains " unreconstructedly anti-Semitic , " wonder if Kreisky acceded to the terrorists ' demands partly to prove how genuinely Austrian he is . <P> Whatever his motivation , Kreisky 's action was the most controversial of a long political career that had previously been marked by such studied caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most astute politician . Despite his background as the son of a wealthy industrialist , Kreisky joined the socialist movement at age 15 . After the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 , he fled to Sweden . Thirteen years passed before he returned home . First as a diplomat and then as Foreign Minister ( 1959-66 ) , Kreisky deftly helped steer Austria on the course of political neutrality . <P> Although his office is filled with ceremonial symbols of Austria 's imperial past , Kreisky has been a most unregal Chancellor . He freely mingles with the public without a bodyguard , writes innumerable thank-you notes , and waits his turn in line for the ski lift when on vacation . He also hobnobs with Vienna 's most brilliant intellectuals and artists . The ease with which he mixes with all strata of Austrians has made him his country 's most popular postwar Chancellor , so much so that a Kreisky-souvenir industry has blossomed-complete with Kreisky piggy banks , T shirts and clothes hangers . A bestseller is a wall poster depicting the Chancellor in a superman costume leaping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists , however , is one hurdle he has not cleared . The unexpected criticism he has drawn from Austrian intellectuals and from abroad has made him unusually defensive . " No one can criticize my decision , " he told TIME Correspondent Christopher Byron . " No one but I was in the situation and no one else had to live with the consequences . To permit the hostages to leave the country would have meant certain death , and I was willing to do everything to get them released . " <P> He insists that " I would do it again if the identical situation arose . " But his friends wonder . Under the week 's pressures , Kreisky has lost his cool and become noticeably irritable . He is usually a deft performer at press conferences , but last week he blew up when a Dutch journalist asked him , " Are you a Jew ? " The testy Chancellor flared back : " It 's none of your business ! "               @ @ @ @ @ @
