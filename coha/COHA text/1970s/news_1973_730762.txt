txt President Nixon handed his Watergate problem over to his new Attorney General , Elliot L. Richardsen , this last week , saying he himself must turn his attention " back to our goal of a lasting structure of peace in the world , ? work that can not wait , work that I must do . " He promptly went into two days of talking with and entertaining one of the most powerful of world statesmen , Germah Chancellor Willy Brandt . And his White House an- nounced that at the end of the month he would be meeting another important and much more difficult , statesman , French President Pompidou , in Iceland . But whether anything 12131.21 come of these meetings with allied statesmen , or with a visit by Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev , who is expected to be coming this way later in the spring , depends now on a problem right here in Washington that no one can solve for Mr. Nixon but he himself : Can he , repair his damaged relations with the Congress ? Congress holds reins His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can proceed further only if Congress al- lows them to proceed further , ' Until now Mr. Nixon was in the first phase of his . foreign-policylYrogram --  where he could act by himself without needing any legislation from the Congress . He could travel to China all on his own initiative and ' responsibility . He could send his foreign-policy expert , . Henry A. Kissinger , to Moscow , , ' Hanoi , Peking , or Paris without any permission from the Senate . He " himself can travel to Moscow any day he likes , all on his own without any " by your leave " from anyone else . The atmospherics part of foreign policy requires no act of Congress . But that phase in Mr. Nixon 's ' progress toward his foreign policy goals is finished . A Chinese diplomatic mission is in Washington and an American diplomatic mission is set up in Peking . Excellent channels for quick communication exist between Washington and MoscOw . " There is an official cease-fire in Vietnam . And the Brandt visit is part of plans for " the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new foreign policy there is only one where further advances can perhaps be made without an act of Congress . Mr. Nixon has not yet had to ask Congress for any legislation concerning the new relations with China . They are easy , friendly , and improving . ( Even with China , however , Mr. Nixon may need a little congressional help  --  if , for instance , Peking pushes hard for most favored nation status in trade . ) Elsewhere it is entirely different . A final settlement in Vietnam requires an appropriation by Congress of a reconstruction program for North Vietnam . It has been promised in the Paris agreements . But right now it would be a waste of time for Mr. Nixon to ask Congress for money for that purpose . He would n't get a penny . *Congress 's hold on Nixon foreign policy // Further progress on the detente with Soviet Russia depends on giving Russia " most favored nation treatment . " Mr. Nixon has promised that treatment to Russia . It is an essential part of the trade agreement Mr. Nixon has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress before he can deliver on his promise . Most vital policies Perhaps the most vital ? of all the pending , foreign policies ' is the repair of American relations with Western Europe and Japan . But that calls for moving " from confrontation to negotiation in the field of trade . " To that end Mr. Nixon has sent to Congress the " Trade Reform Act of 1978 . " It would permit him to negotiate for reduction of " nontariff trade barriers . " But Congress is now sitting on that bill . Some think of equal importance to the future is the American military relationship with its NATO allies in Western Europe . But Congress is **39;1117;TOOLONG Europe . Only the greatest tact can prevent Congress from doing arbitrarily here what Mr. Nixon prefers to do with gradual and phased withclrawal ? of American forces in return for a pullback of Russian forces .

In no mood Congress is simply in no mood right now to do those things it must do to ? permit completion of the Nixon foreign policy . High level visits can go on . Dr. Kissinger can travel ' and talk . - But nothing of-an important-forward , nature can be done until and unless Congress gives its consent . Mr. Nixon must settle with Congress before he can settle with foreign countries . , - Can he settle With Congress ? Not unless he changes the style of his attitude toward the Congress and the machinery  --  or cooperation . The biggist single foreign-policy question in the world today is whether , and if so when , President Nixon can reopen easy and constructive relations with the Congress . No further impOrtant world business can be done ' until that can be done . All important business must mark time until that question is resolved .                @ @ @ @ @
