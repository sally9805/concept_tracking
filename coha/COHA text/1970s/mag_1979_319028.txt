Red is sexy , yellow ... ? <P> When the New Bedford Gas &; Edison Light Co. asked for permission to install energy-efficient amber streetlights on Cape Cod , Artist Eloise Barnhurst strenuously objected . At a public hearing in Falmouth , Mass. , Barnhurst , who serves as a consultant on color to cosmetic companies and advertisers , warned that amber is a potentially explosive mixture of red and yellow . Said she : " Red is the color of sex , but yellow is a nerve energizer that keeps us awake . " <P> Thus , in her view , an amber glow could make pedestrians and motorists both sexy and cautious . Said Barnhurst : " Our bodies and minds will not know which way to go . Everyone knows you ca n't think and make love at the same time . " The resulting frustration , she said , might lead to " increased vandalism and other types of misbehavior . " In fact , she said , once while driving past a Hyannis motel with amber lights , she " wanted to scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she restrained herself because she is " 61 and self-contained . " <P> Said Falmouth Selectman Eric Turkington : " There 's some validity to what she says . " To shed more light on the subject , another hearing will be held next week .
