For the first time in his presidency , Richard Nixon was moved to use the Taft-Hartley Act . Despite his longstanding reluctance to interfere in labor disputes , he sent Justice Department attorneys into federal court last week to stop the 98-day strike by the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union that had shut down every port on the West Coast . The economic impact gave him no choice . Citing the " irreparable injury " of the strike , Government lawyers were granted a temporary restraining order . This week the court will consider a permanent injunction that would impose an 80-day cooling-off period . <P> Longshoremen also struck East and Gulf Coast ports two weeks ago , but the walkout in the West had already gone on much longer with more serious consequences . The 15,000 striking I.L.W.U. members had idled 249 ships at a cost of about $2 billion . Feed grains , furniture , machinery and even Christmas trees destined for Viet Nam had piled up near the docks ; ships carrying bicycles and Scotch were anchored in the ports . Major importers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sales by 15% , and West Coast politicians had bombarded Nixon with demands that he intervene . <P> From Anathema to Statesman . He might have responded sooner but for the fact that shippers had cautioned him to keep hands off . They were worried that I.L.W.U. President Harry Bridges might lose control of his union if the Federal Government got involved . Once anathema to management because of his fiery radicalism and flirtation with Communism , Bridges is now respected as a labor statesman . In recent years he has agreed to eliminate featherbedding in return for more job security and fringe benefits . Because of his new stance . Bridges is now under attack from militants within the union . Alarmed over the decline in jobs on the docks , they have insisted that the I.L.W.U. be given jurisdiction over loading the huge containers now used to carry ship-borne cargo . Since the Teamsters already have jurisdiction over many of these jobs , the I.L.W.U. forced a strike to decide the issue . But the shippers ' Pacific Maritime Association refuses to choose between the two unions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike goes on . Tempers are not expected to cool very fast during the cooling-off period . <P> On the East Coast , shippers are no more anxious for Nixon to intervene than they were in the West . The 45,000 striking members of the International Longshoremen 's Association , on the other hand , insist that the shippers have locked them out ; they would welcome an order to return to work . It was the shippers who forced the strike when the three-year contract expired two weeks ago . New York shippers served notice on the I.L.A. local that they would no longer accept the contract definition of a guaranteed annual wage . They insisted that they were being driven into bankruptcy . By guaranteeing every union member 2,080 hours of work a year at $4.60 an hour , they had expected to lay out an extra $13 million annually . Instead , they found themselves paying $30 million . They charged that an overly generous decision by labor mediators had enabled union members to draw wages without working . Last year , in fact , they paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 28 million .
