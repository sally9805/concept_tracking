A growing sense of crisis surrounds Britain 's latest attempt to gain entry into the thriving six-nation European Economic Community . Twice in the past ten years Britain 's application has been rejected . This time there is a widespread conviction throughout Europe that a third failure would be the last . No one believes this more firmly than British Prime Minister Edward Heath , who led Britain 's first unsuccessful attempt in the 1961-63 Brussels negotiations . " If we miss this opportunity , it will not be there for us to pick up in a year or two , " Heath tells audiences . <P> Heath 's worry is partly one of timing . After several preliminary sessions , the crucial negotiations for British entry are now scheduled for mid-May in Brussels . If the six Market members ( Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , The Netherlands and West Germany ) do not agree in principle to British admission by July , Heath , who must face his party conference in October , is certain to run into a severe backlash in Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking EEC membership , but the British public is less enthusiastic . Food prices would rise 26% after entry , pushing up the cost of living an estimated 4% to 5% . Many Britons also resent the EEC 's implied surrender of sovereignty . Public-opinion samplings indicate that 66% of those questioned oppose British entry , and 82% believe that the issue should be submitted to the voters as a referendum . <P> Common Currency . The consequences of failure would be severe . If Britain does not join the Common Market , the old dreams of a politically and economically united Western Europe , which were so long blocked by Charles de Gaulle , would once again be stymied . Europe would show that it lacks the will and ability to work to achieve the degree of political cohesion that it needs to counterbalance the Soviet Union , the U.S. and China . By contrast , British entry would open the way to the Common Market 's growth and development . Since Britain is the major force in the eight-nation European Free Trade Association , - it could lead EFTA members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's largest free-trading area , whose gross national product would be second only to the U.S. 's . The expanded EEC could then proceed toward the goal of establishing a common currency for all Western Europe by 1980 . That development would nudge the bigger community toward substantial political unity , since monetary policy would be decided largely by Common Market headquarters at Brussels and not by individual governments . <P> European leaders are aware of the enormous size of the stakes-and of the danger that the negotiations will founder on petty details . West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has assured Heath that he will press for a speedy decision . French President Georges Pompidou recently intimated that he will confer directly with Heath if the negotiators are unable to cut their way through the maze of issues . Pompidou has said that he favors British admission , but there is some suspicion that the French once more are seeking to find an issue on which to block British admission , as they have done twice before .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
