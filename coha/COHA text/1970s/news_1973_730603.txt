txt A gradual upsurge in Communist-initiated military activity in the ground war in South Vietnam now is taking place . In one 24-hour period ending on Jan. 4 , South Vietnamese military officials reported 116 enemy incidents , the highest total since last Nov. 2 . This compared with 81 and 49 incidents on the two previous days in January This increased activity could have many explanations , informants here concede . The ending of the New Year truce , the halting of the B-52 bombing campaign against the Hanoi-Haiphong industrial complex , the impending resumption of cease-fire talks in Paris all may play a part . Whatever the cause , American and South Vietnamese experts are keeping a wary eye on the rising curve of Communist activity ? especially since up to now the military situation has been so quiet Assessment must wait It still is regarded as too early to rate the current upsurge as being of major significance , however . For some time past , the South Vietnamese Army has been marking time as far as initiating any major attacks against the North Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , have seemed to be following a " wait and see " tactic ? waiting to see what happens in Paris and what are Hanoi 's post-bombing instructions . It was conceded , however , that ground conflict here nevertheless could escalate at any time , if either side felt the moment was propitious to make a worthwhile gain . Sporadic clashes already have occurred within a 50-mile radius of Saigon , but thus far none of these has been of sufficient duration to rank as dangerous . // AP photo . . Saigon 's soldiers sweat it out oncontinuing battlefield *Hanoi steps up action in South // President Thieu , meanwhile , shows no inclination to send his forces on even limited offensives during the current lull , despite reports that some American officials have put pressure on him to do so . One reason , according to expert analysts , is that the South Vietnamese leader feels his armed forces have not yet fully recovered from the battering received during the North Vietnamese offensive last spring and summer . Losses still are being replaced , units recycled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reputed preoccupation with the cease-fire negotiations . Keeping up with every aspect of truce developments in Paris and Washington doubtless seems more important to Mr. Thieu for the immediate future of his country than concentrating on yet another costly military campaign . The Americans are said to have urged an attack in the Bolovens Plateau area in southern Laos , one of the staging areas for North Vietnamese attacks . But Mr. Thieu still has unrecaptured areas in South Vietnam to consider . Movement imperceptible ' The forward movement of his forces in Quang Tri Province in the far north and the An Loc area north of Saigon has been almost imperceptible over a period of weeks This reflects both respect for North Vietnamese strength and a desire to keep South Vietnamese casualties modest . North Vietnamese Regular Army units in the South , plus local Communist Viet Cong elements , likewise have tended to be relatively quiet ? for different reasons .

They need to know if new supplies will be delayed in reaching them .
