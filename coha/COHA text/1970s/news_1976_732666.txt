txt Republicans ! A local band may be playing a GOP song , and the faces behind the counter telling you " Glad to have you here , " and a farm family in a pickup truck may pull over to snap a Brownie flash and wave . You may be walking through a slice of conservative Middle America , but you 're walking on hallowed ground . This is " Harry 's town . " And Republican it 's not . There has n't been a Republican mayor since 1928 . And while the Republican delegates are talking " Ford " and " Reagan " on corners and in hotel lobbies , locals are still talking about " Harry . " TWELFTH AND Baltimore Streets is where Harry Truman had his haberdashery . And in the Muehiebach Hotel is where the former President had his bourbon ? " Harry did n't go in no saloons . " Along Main and Wyandotte and up 13th and 14th Streets , now strung up with paper elephants and political bunting , is where Harry would walk when he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Harry was what this town is , " says one hotel bellman . . " Plain speaking , plain drinking , and down-to-earth . " " NOBODY 'S PAID attention to Kansas City until now , said Graf Krouse , a motel clerk . " Kansas City is like Sleeping Beauty . It 's been sleeping for 100 years , and the Republican Convention is the handsome prince that 's come along . What we want to see is if he 'll kiss her and finally wake her up . " Not that Kansas City really has been sleeping . It 's just that noboby paid much attention to her until a few years ago , when the city leaders decided it was time for the world to sit up and take a look at " these parks , these plazas , these skyscrapers on the plains . " The town was not only growing out , it was growing up , so a slick New York public-relations firm was hired to promote the city . The new campaign was dubbed " Prime Time . " " Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because the town was waking up . It had come out of its coccoon and was ready to flap its wings . Like prime time , it was ready to be seen by everyone . " DR . CHARLES KENDALL , a leading . research scientist and father of the Kansas City Prime Time effort , says , " Those who thought they knew Kansas City were under misconceptions . And the others did n't know anything about it , at all . " I was in New York once and I asked a New Yorker , ' What do you think of Kansas City ? ' " " He replied , ' I never think of Kansas City . ' That , " says Kimball , " was our problem . " Getting the Republican Convention here , civic leaders believed , would be the real eye-opener  --  a chance to show off this " capital of the plains " to the thousands who would fly in from around the country , clutching their suitcases , golf clubs , and Republican pins . " WE KNEW bringing the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkley . " It would be a brand-new ball game for us . But we think that Kansas City will catch on now . The convention will put us on the map . " Kansas City . was once very much on the map . The Sante Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail began here . Trains came blustering through once at the rate of 200 a day . Riverboats lazed down the Missouri River to dock along the city 's banks , and longhorn steers from Texas and the West were shipped here for slaughter . The locals call it a " town where a man can still make it . " Old Man Tom Pendergast built his political machine here back in the 1920s without ever running for office . The city made millionaires of the Katz brothers and their drug stores . H &R; Block and their income-tax service . Joyce Hall and his Hallmark greeting cards . THE METROPOLITAN area is larger than London 's but nobody is crowded here . It has more fountains than Rome , without its traffic problems . Fifty per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no corn stalks between cement cracks . And although there are stockyards and cattle auctions just about every morning , anyone will tell you , " This is no cow town . " Some locals do wonder if Kansas City is a convention town  --  yet . " I do n't think we 're ready for this convention , " says one Kansas City policeman . " All we 've got is 1,200 policemen on the entire force . That 's the number of policemen in New York assigned just to the Democratic Convention . I 'm not sure we can handle it if something happens . I heard that we were trying for the 1980 convention and got this one , instead . I do n't know the reasons why . " ONE OF THE reasons , says councilman Berkley , " was that President Ford feels comfortable here . " It is indeed a town where most anyone would feel comfortable , unless the 582 cabs in town ca n't handle the 22,000 visitors who are going to descend on it . Or delegates getting out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink anywhere after 1 a.m. in Missouri and ca n't find a bar at all in Kansas . Or they do n't like staying in hotels spread from Kansas City , Mo. , to Lawrence , Kan. , because there 's not enough space in town . way . They 'll be 12 inches long and six inches wide and $88 of it is tax-deductible , " he says . There has been only one flap in this easy-going city since the convention started coming to town . That came when Richard Frame , the Pennsylvania state Republican chairman , complained to the press in Washington that his hotel " was in the middle of a cornfield where you ca n't get a drink or your suit pressed . " When Maury Bluhm , president of the Airport Plaza Inn heard that , he said Frame and the rest of the Pennsylvania delegation could consider themselves out of the 235 rooms they 'd reserved at his hotel . if they were going to talk that way , Bluhm did n't want them . " WE 'VE GOT four bars , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens , " said- Bluhm . " It 's not in the middle of a cornfield . There 's not a cornfield around for at least a mile . I said Frame better bring a pup tent to stay in if he 's coming to Kansas City , unless he makes a public apology . " This really bugged me . I do n't think he 'd ever seen the place . But I tell you , these Easterners are so provincial that when they get west of Philadelphia , they think they are charter members of the Lewis and Clark expedition . " Frame made the apology before the press , and when he arrived in Kansas City , Bluhm was there to greet him . He led Frame down a red carpet to a pup tent on a putting green . Inside was a sleeping bag , an ironing board , and a jug of corn whisky . But Frame also came prepared . He 'd brought his own tent  --  just in case , and a five-pound bag of Pennsylvania Hershey candy kisses . The two exchanged kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GOP and the people of Kansas City are getting on well . Tile few grumbles heard so far are from the bar owners who want to stay open past 1 a.m. and on Sunday to get their share of the convention profits . " THIS AI N'T no convention town , " complained one young cab driver . " There 's nobody on the streets at night . There 's nothing to do . This place is ' for families . It 's quiet . Here people go home at night and watch TV . They do n't spend their money on nightlife . They buy a pickup truck or a CB radio . This place is dead . You know it 's got to be dead if it takes a Republican convention to wake it up . " " We do n't want to be New York or Chicago or the West Coast , " said one longtime Kansas City Democrat . We 're not going to chinge our laws or change our ways just ' cause we 're , getting big . We want to be the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're going to show these conventioneers how to live . Do n't matter if they 're Republicans , we 'll give them a good time . As long as it 's only for a week or so , Harry 's town and the GOP will get along just fine . " That seems to be the mood all around town . ' A sign over a bar along the river lays it best . It reads : " Even Republicans need love . "
