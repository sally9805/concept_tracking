Twelve musicians filed into the orchestra pit of the Chicago Civic Opera House , carrying strange  --  ly shaped instruments and dressed in baggy gray pant-suits reminiscent of overalls . They sat down and began to scrape , tweet , pluck and thump like any small orchestra anywhere in the world . They were the first emissaries from the Peo  --  ple 's Republic of China ever to be seen by the American public since the revolution of 1949 closed the gates between China and the United States . The house was full . Some of us in the front rows could not resist going to the rail to look down on the musicians and compare their fiddles and flutes with our own kind . They smiled back and showed us how the instruments were played . The lights dimmed . A majestic Chinese lady in Western dress stepped from the wings , accompa  --  nied by an American girl , holding her hand as if for reassurance . In piercing clarion tones and in strong cadences , like a herald 's , the Chinese lady spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what turned out to be the singing names of the performers we were about to watch , and the title of their act  --  Lion Dance . It was the first act of a two-and-a-half-hour performance by the Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe , and this was their first look at the American public . Weeks later they were to leave the United States with a trunkful of enthusiastic press clip  --  pings , but on that opening night no one knew what this overture to peaceful relations between two great powers would be like . The curtain rose on an empty stage and a backdrop of heavenly blue summer sky with wisps of white clouds . We made a soft sound of surprised delight . The next instant two enor  --  mous , shaggy and golden lions leaped on stage with blood-red jaws , shaking their heads and tails . And two little boys ran after them . The lions did fearful things but the little boys were brave against fangs and claws . With tambourines , clever ploys and agility , they gradually wore out the lions , tamed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball and rolling it up and down a seesaw . The orchestra cued us firmly into the proper moods of laughter , fear , courage , tri  --  umph . Finally , each lion split in the middle and re  --  vealed the two pairs of young men who had ac  --  complished a truly fantastic coordination of leaps and bounds and running around . We clapped happily to reward them and they , like actors anywhere , loved the clapping . But we were also clapping , I felt , with a sense of relief . We had been afraid that the dancers might embarrass us somehow . Perhaps they would step out of their roles and address us di  --  rectly on other matters . Our own avant-garde actors have done just that , and sometimes they have even climbed all over us in the audience . So we clapped in astonishment at the artistry and also in relief , and the actors bowed and smiled , perhaps , with the same sort of relief . Audiences throughout history have pelted the stage with vegetables and eggs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Why two lions ? Where did they come from ? Why the little boys ? How did they really tame the lions ? The program ex  --  plained that it was a very ancient folk dance from the Shenyang Province . Ah , yes , we nod  --  ded , we know all about that . Ethnic . Ethnicity // adds a little accent to our American way of life , too  --  like pizza , giros , sauerkraut and paella . And , chop suey . The few backdrops were , like the heavenly sky , strikingly suggestive of the peaceful and enduring aspect of the world beyond the stage . The effect was discreet but strong , and it fitted into everything else . Not only the backdrops but the smallest detail had its purpose on stage . After all , the different acts were one or two thousand years old . Older than Europe . One would expect a polished , coherent production . And the Shen  --  yang Troupe had been selected out of many others , so that it was a composite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was superb in Chinese terms . Their judges were no fools  --  it was also superb by our standards , despite the enormous differences between the two . Our western acrobats design their acts like set pieces and they enter them as through an invisi  --  ble portal . They come on stage with movements and expressions just like yours and mine . The drums roll and a metamorphosis begins . The per  --  former is suddenly standing very still in a posi  --  tion that we could not imitate , and he seems to be growing larger . At what appears to be an inner // 55 movement , the more shattering the noise the warrior makes  --  not just to intimidate but to accelerate and magnify his own effectiveness . Yet in the whole of the Shenyang show , there were no handclaps , hups , banzais , oles or Chinese GO . There seemed to be no invisible door through which the acrobats came and went . They started their feats and finished them without transformations or even pauses . They moved about at all times like ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise as though they had no special knowledge of the laws of physics , skeletons , muscles and nerves . Two men balanced tables and chairs , one on top of another , until it looked as though a fly could topple them . One man climbed the pile and did a handstand . A girl casually slid upwards after him , climbed on his upside-down back and did a handstand on his neck so that both pairs of feet were pointing at the ceiling . Having some  --  how acquired a vase , in a calm backbend she used her feet to put the vase on her head . They then went into other hair-raising postures using their knowledge of inertia and gravity without a single cautious movement . No alley-oops . The whole impossible scene then dissolved with the same serene ease . A girl rode a bicycle in loops around the stage . Another girl casually got on without slowing the bike . A third girl climbed on , a fourth , a fifth . A sixth , seventh , eighth  --  finally nine girls festooned themselves sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and on top of the original girl , who never stopped pedaling . With fantastic fluidity the forty acrobats , half of them girls , wove everything together . It was , in a basic sense , a ballet we watched  --  a series of body positions flowing one into the next without a break , producing lovely patterns of torsos , legs , arms and faces , upside-down , horizontal , angled in all directions . The faces were most important . At first the girls looked alike because each wore two short pigtails and all were dark haired . The boys also had hairdos that made them look alike .

He has learned things about gravity , inertia , mo  --  tion , the conservation of energy , centripetal force , and so on , that we know nothing about . Mother Nature would kill us instantly if we at  --  tempted what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it begins , and he comes flying out , as from a space-time machine . As his feet touch the familiar stage on our side of the machine , he is transformed back into a familiar human being with his kneecaps , thighs and shoul  --  derblades all in the right places . He moves about again just like ordinary folk , strutting a bit . Part of his secret knowledge of Mother Nature is the magic command with which , after he has wound himself up , he triggers himself into action . He shouts , or claps his hands , or the big drum booms . That percussion in our ears and his , the holm and hups and o/es and go 's , are absolutely necessary . In the fighting techniques we have learned from the East , like karate , and even in the exer  --  cises that have been developed from these tech  --  niques , like tai chi , such triggering shouts are also necessary .

If you play golf on , say , Tuesdays and Sunday afternoons , you should real  --  ly get a little exercise on Monday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , too . It will keep you in better physical condition and make your round of golf less of a physical strain . Some women do use their mus  --  cles in their daily activities , as when carrying a child , a load of laundry , or a large bag of groceries . Ironing clothes , playing with the children , or strange to us , however , was the fact that they were always dressed alike . The costumes changed for different numbers but , in each , they were the same . There were no spangles to identify the stars . But there were smiles . After a short time I began to distinguish faces by their smiles and I looked for and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be capa  --  ble of taking on any of the tasks in the teamwork , but the smiles , after all , remained personal . They were inviting , shy , arch , happy , broad , polite . By the end of the show , I knew a dozen faces . Not only do Chinese acrobatics go back to prehis  --  toric times , so do Western . Some  --  times they included an element of danger other than gravity  --  the Mino  --  an bull cult , for example . All peoples delight in watching what appear to be tricks being played on the laws of nature . But for the performers , it is adancing can also be good exercise . Unfortunately for our good health , many of a woman 's activities are so automated that she does n't get to lift , carry , iron , or sweep . A woman who works in an office at a type  --  writer hardly uses her muscles at all . In order to make up for the lack of needed activity , women ( and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first these con  --  sisted of the knee-bending , toe-touching , and push-up sort of thing . When that grew dull , people turned to more interesting forms of exercise like yoga and jogging . Neither of these two can be beaten to promote general conditioning .

Like mu . icians , dancers and athletes anywhere in the world , the Chinese acrobats practice three or four hours a day and perform in public several times a week .

They consider them  --  selves truly artists , therefore , in that they teach the community about itself . To make certain that they do not fall into lazy habits , they must work two months of every year as peasants or as factory laborers . This integration is present in their work as acrobats , too . There are no stagehands . The acrobats themselves prepare the stage , move the props about , assemble and take them apart . A star performer in one num  --  ber may carry tables and chairs in another . This sort of group identifi  --  cation is not accomplished merely , by edict from the manager . It is part of the upbringing in China today . The Shenyang Troupe 's perfor  --  mance was exotic because the whole , overall effect , rather than individual acts , was the primary consideration throughout the show . It touched most reviewers and made us all a lit  --  tle thoughtful . IT     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
