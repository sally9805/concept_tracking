Both the virtues and defects of congressional investigating committees have lately been on display , thanks to Watergate , and last week there was some fresh evidence on the debit side - at least in form . The substance was still obscure . During hearings by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , headed by Senator Henry M. Jackson , Elliott Roosevelt , 63 , the second son of President Franklin Roosevelt , was accused of plotting the assassination of Lynden O. Pindling , Prime Minister of the Bahamas . <P> The charges came from Louis P. Mastriana , a convicted stock swindler and onetime Roosevelt employee , who was testifying during an investigation of organized crime in stock and security frauds . Under questioning by Senator Charles Percy , Mastriana told the subcommittee members that in 1968 he had been offered $100,000 by Roosevelt and Michael McLaney , a reputed associate of Gambling Czar Meyer Lansky , to kill Pindling after the Prime Minister refused to grant McLaney a gambling license in exchange for campaign contributions . <P> Mastriana produced a $2,500 check , part of an alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mastriana . In addition , Mastriana charged , Roosevelt had been involved in the attempted sale of $150,000 in stolen securities . He insisted that he had recordings to prove his accusations , but committee investigators said that the tapes were indecipherable . <P> Cheap Sensation . From his ranch outside Lisbon , Roosevelt denied the charges , described Mastriana 's story as " absolutely fantastic " and accused the subcommittee of using his name " to get a cheap sensational headline . " Roosevelt demanded a public apology from Senator Jackson and offered to testify publicly in his own behalf . <P> The charges against Roosevelt , a former mayor of Miami Beach who writes , breeds horses and promotes Portuguese tourism , first came to light during a private session between Mastriana and subcommittee investigators . At least two more witnesses met with subcommittee investigators and were prepared to testify about Roosevelt 's alleged security misdealings . According to Subcommittee Chairman Jackson , attempts to interview Roosevelt about this during a visit to Florida in August were unsuccessful , and a public airing of the **26;2149;TOOLONG portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Obviously displeased that Mastriana 's allegations were brought out prematurely by Percy , Jackson suspended further testimony until next week , when Roosevelt is scheduled to return to Washington and confront his accuser . It could be quite an encounter . Mastriana 's police record includes arrests for gambling , grand larceny , forgery , aggravated assault and possession of the contents of stolen mail . Three years ago , he was declared mentally incompetent by a New Jersey court . " He 's the greatest bull artist in the world , " a Florida police official said of Mastriana last week .
