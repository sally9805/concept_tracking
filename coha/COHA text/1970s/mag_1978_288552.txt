Inflation is a cruel thing . Gucci is now charging $110 for a pair of loafers , and you ca n't get a hamburger at " 21 " for less than $10 . A Rolls-Royce ? Do n't ask . So what 's a fella gon na do at Christmas time but ask Santa for a raise ? Which brings us to Johnny Carson , who has been put-putting along on only $1.5 million a year . Last week jolly old NBC raised its No. 1 star a cool $1 million , to $2.5 million per . <P> To sweeten the deal even further , NBC also reduced Carson 's work load . Johnny , a pioneer of the four-day week , now does his late-night talk show 38 weeks a year . In the future , said NBC , he will have to work only three days a week for 25 weeks and four days for 13 weeks . If you want to divide that with the calculator you got for Christmas , you will come up with Johnny 's hourly salary-$13,123 . There 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
