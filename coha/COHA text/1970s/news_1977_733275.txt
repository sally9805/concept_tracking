Some 75 demonstrators assembled at Dawes Elementary School , 3810 IV . 81st Pl. , before moving to Stevenson where the first hint of trouble developed . THE PROTESTERS , singing patriotic songs and chanting racial taunts , were sitting near the flagpole on the Stevenson grounds when William Woods , 8th district police commander , ordered them off under threat of arrest . A police lieutenant , John Collins , told the crowd , nearly all women , " Get moving , we do n't want to arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complained to protesters that their noise was " disturbing the kids " at Stevenson . " Let the school alone , " he said . " Picket peacefully . " The demonstrators left the school grounds . But Connie Schaefer , chairman of the Began Community Council and a key antibusing leader , said , " We are on our property . We paid for it with our taxes . " SOME OF THE protesters had written the word " Resist " on their foreheads and arms . They marched one block north to Hancock school where the second incident took place . The 19 women and 3 men b locked the eastbound lane of 79th Street at Kostner Avenue by sitting in the street . Police had to reroute traffic , causing a traffic backup . Other women distributed leaflets in the name of the Bogen Community Council , announcing a torchlight parade at 7:30 p.m . Sunday at Began High School , 3939 W. 79th St. Meanwhile Woods asked protesters If they planned to continue their sit-in on the street . When they answered " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides continued to appeal to the protesters to stop blocking 79th Street . Finally the protesters got up and walked to the curb . THEN SOME of them said they would board the next westbound 79th Street bus and refuse to pay their fares . When the bus arrived , the driver unsuccessfully tried to go around as 50 demonstrators blocked its passage . Some shouted , " See , no'free transport a t ion for us , " " Where 's our transportation ? " and " They wo n't let us have a bus . " Woods kept trying to disperse the crowd as a police squadrol pulled up in front of the 79th Street bus . Through a bullhorn he said , " You are in violation of law  --  obstructing traffic . You either move or you will be locked up . " SEVERAL PROTESTERS blacking the bus ' path moved to the curb . Others discussed the situation with Woods , then joined the other protesters and the bus continued westbound . The closest thing to an arrest happened when policemen grabbed one woman and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll go to the curb , "
