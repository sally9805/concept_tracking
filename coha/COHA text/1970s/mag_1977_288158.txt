Going back to the basics in Austin <P> Let 's go to Luckenbach , Texas <P> Waylon and Willie and the boys <P> <P> Jerry Jeff Walker , one of the hard-drinking boys , takes the stage and barrels into a country rocker titled Gettin ' By . Almost immediately a fistfight breaks out in one corner of the auditorium ; dancing bursts out in another . Midway through Walker 's set the pedal steel-guitar player takes over with a whining rendition of Dixie , The Battle Hymn of the Republic and America the Beautiful The crowd of 1,500 cheers , hoisting half-empty Lone Star beers toward the stage . Walker finishes his two-hour performance , then returns for an encore number , Pissin ' in the Wind . By now the audience is standing on chairs , whooping , waving Stetsons and screaming for more . The scene is good-time Texas honky-tonk anarchy . It is Saturday night at the Austin Opry House . <P> With one stage for every ten musicians in town , Austin has blossomed into a performer 's paradise . Hangar-size halls like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Split Rail give steady work to such country-rock artists as Marsha Ball , Joe Ely and 400 of their fellow singers , songwriters and pickers . Because of Austin 's relatively low cost of living , musicians can work cheaply . " And if they 're down on their luck , " says a local writer , " they can score a dope deal to hold them over . " <P> If the heart of Texas music beats in the capital city , its soul is in Luckenbach , a sleepy hamlet 65 miles away . After 128 years of near total obscurity , the three-family town was put on the map abruptly by Waylon Jennings ' hit recording . Luckenbach , Texas sped to the top of the country-music charts , and the album it came from , Ol ' Waylon , became Jennings ' fourth gold LP within a year . <P> With one house , a crumbling blacksmith shop , a dance hall and a combination post office-saloon , Luckenbach belongs on an MGM back lot . Its rise began in 1970 when a slow-talking rancher and raconteur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his unhappiness with the saloon 's irregular hours . Soon the place was a laid-back , beer-stocked afternoon retreat for country musicians . Among them : Jerry Jeff Walker , who brought old pals like Willie Nelson by for a visit and in 1973 recorded his Viva Terlingua album there . <P> Then came the song , an appeal to country living and simpler ways : <P> We been so busy keepin ' up with the Jones ' <P> Four-car garage and we 're still buildin ' on <P> Maybe it 's time we got back to the basics of love . <P> No matter that ol ' Waylon and the song 's two writers had never been to Luckenbach . The tune captured the essence of Texas ' country music-a return to the basics . " It 's a symbol , really , of something that people are retreatin ' to , " says Nelson , easily the most visible member of Austin 's musical colony .
