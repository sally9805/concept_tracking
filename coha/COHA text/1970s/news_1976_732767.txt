txt President Ford 's strategists now say the race is a virtual deadlock and that their candidate will be the beneficiary of a tie situation . ? They believe the " undecideds , " now estimated at about 10 percent of the electorate by the pollsters , will move more toward Mr. Ford than to Mr. Carter on Election Day . Says one Ford campaign operative : " When these undecided voters get in the voting booth , they will find it very difficult to vote against the President . " Many of them will be saying to themselves : It 's a tossup between these two candidates ? so I 'll vote for the President simply because I think he should have a chance to have a few years and prove himself . ' " Further , many of these undecideds will be in that position because they really do n't know Carter , where he stands , what he might do . So they will go to Ford because he is a known quantity , even if they are not wild about everything he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undecideds ' ? The Ford people also are counting on independent candidate Eugene McCarthy to cut even more deeply into the potential Carter vote . Some polls show Mr. McCarthy picking up 6 percent of the vote . Democratic national chairman Robert Strauss admits that most of this vote for Mr. McCarthy will be taken away from Mr. Carter , not Mr. Ford . Of the McCarthy influence on the outcome , a Ford strategist says : " McCarthy will be making a speech on national TV very soon . His campaign is heating up . He 's becoming more and more visible ? and he 's hitting Carter much harder than he is Ford . McCarthy is bound to help us a lot in the last few days . " ? Finally , the Ford outlook ( perhaps overly rosy ) sees the prospect of some 50 million potential voters failing to vote on Nov. 2 as a plus for Ford ? " enough to win us the election , " a Ford campaign aide says . The Ford campaign people believe that far more of the nonvoters will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might have voted for Mr. Ford . " They talk about all these millions of newly registered voters that will help Carter this time , " this aide says . " But that does n't mean that they will actually-vote . " He acknowledged , however , that a highly effective get-out-the-vote effort by labor might make his prediction a bad one . " Sure , " he said , " this gives them a big potential . But I do n't think it 's going to come about . " The confidence expressed in high-up Ford circles is probably largely political ? coming from a realization that there are no political gains to be made out of expressions that are less than fully optimistic . But at least one Ford aide admits that the President must somehow recapture the momentum ? lost during the second debate ? if he is to catch Mr. Carter . To regain a pro-Ford movement in the campaign , the Ford people are counting on a strong presidential performance in the last debate to be held Friday night in Williamsburg , Virginia .
