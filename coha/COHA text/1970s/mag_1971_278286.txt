It is an odd company . Hairy-nosed wombats in southern Australia . Giant turtles on the Galapagos Islands . Polar bears in the Arctic . What each species shares with the others is an improving prospect for survival due to the efforts of a unique conservation organization . That group is the World Wildlife Fund , whose members gathered last week in Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria hotel to celebrate with deserved pride their tenth anniversary . From an obscure club of wealthy do-gooders , W.W.F. has grown into a United Nations of conservation , whose efforts on behalf of hundreds of endangered species are felt from Scotland to Sumatra . <P> Under the guidance of softspoken , spectacled Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands , the fund 's international president , W.W.F. has launched 550 rescue projects for threatened species in 60 countries . In addition to exotic animals like the wombat , the organization has also helped more common species . Last year , America 's largest furriers union reached an agreement with W.W.F. to stop accepting pelts taken from spotted cats , thus ensuring that the big felines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The members have even prevailed upon some of the world 's major airlines to stop promoting safari tours on which endangered species would be killed . <P> Plug for a Park . On occasion , W.W.F. members have used their prestige to help stem the destruction of endangered species . Charles Lindbergh singlehanded stopped the slaughter of the blue whale off Peru in 1966 by going directly to its President and persuading him to order a stay on the hunting of the species by all whalers . Prince Bernhard has pressured the heads of state of several countries to become more active conservationists . When he visited Ethiopia a few years ago , he sent advance notice that he wanted to visit a national park-knowing full well that none existed in Ethiopia . By the time he arrived , however , a national park had been set aside and prepared for his inspection . <P> W.W.F. is not without its critics , many of them environmental activists who feel that fund members take a dilettante view of conservation . " What they do is fine , " says Joan McIntyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth . " The problem lies more in what they have n't got around to doing . " W.W.F. , she says , does not feel that all wildlife is threatened . Instead , it spends " vast amounts of money saving a few pitiful animals as curiosities and putting them in game preserves . " <P> That criticism was answered indirectly last week when the fund announced a campaign to protect biotopes , or animal habitats . Under the W.W.F. plan , governments will be encouraged to purchase biotopes and protect them against the incursions of man , thus enabling many species to survive and multiply in their natural environments .
