Economist W.S. Jevons astounded the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1878 by postulating that ups and downs in the economy were caused by sunspot cycles , which he said governed agricultural cycles . Economic science has advanced notably since then , and forecasters now focus on more down-to-earth indicators-like housing starts , manufacturers ' new orders and retail sales ( which according to the most recent weekly report ran 11% ahead of a year ago ) . Yet countless Americans have their personal systems for handicapping the economy . Their idiosyncratic indicators are sometimes as reliable as the official measures . <P> Take Mickey Feldstein 's Foolproof Pawnshop Index . Feldstein keeps a close watch on the percentage of pawned items that are eventually redeemed at his Lincoln Loan Bank &; Jewelers in Chicago . In 1966 , when the economy was throbbing , Feldstein 's redemption rate was 90% . In December of 1970 , the Commerce Department 's average of twelve leading indicators was pointing up unmistakably , signaling a big rebound in business . Feldstein knew better ; his redemption rate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebound never came . Today Feldstein sees good times ahead . His redemption rate is a brisk 75% and still rising . <P> Help Wanted . A top San Francisco psychologist notes that when prosperity is right around the corner , patients come flocking to sign up for intensive-and expensive-analysis . Claude Rosenberg , a San Francisco capital-management adviser , has another economic gauge : whether or not brokerage houses are remodeling their offices . " Brokerage expansion is notoriously ill-timed , " he explains . " So when I see them start expensive remodeling projects , I always know that a sharp downturn is on the way . " Few brokerage houses are remodeling these days . <P> The Conference Board , a top business research group , keeps an eagle eye on employment ads in newspapers . The board 's help-wanted index has risen from 75 in January 1971 to 85 last January , but is still far below 1967 's base of 100 . Claims for workmen 's compensation are sensitive to swings in the economy , says Donald Seagraves , vice president of American Mutual Insurance Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient plants-which tend to have high accident rates-are shut down , and employers are under less pressure to throw poorly trained workers on an assembly line just to keep it going . Another bellwether is auto-insurance claims for bodily injury . " During the recession , " says Seagraves , " there is a reduction of travel , and accidents decline . Times must be getting better now , because auto claims are on the rise again . " <P> Dresses Up . The retail business is sprinkled with sensitive economic barometers . Bernard Galitzki , owner of a Portland , Ore. , fabric-store chain , watches women 's dresses . " In a recession , women buy sportswear or no clothes at all , " he says . " A healthy dress business means that women expect their husbands to take them out more . " Women 's secondhand dress shops provide another indicator . Last autumn the clothes on the racks of some shops were three years old ; women were hanging on to their old fashions instead of buying more recent ones-a clear sign of hard times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell old outfits and buy new ones .
