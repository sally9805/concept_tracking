A Soviet playboy embarrasses the CIA <P> Vacation in the Caribbean . A high-priced girlfriend . A luxury Washington apartment . Onetime senior Soviet Diplomat and U.N . Under Secretary-General Arkadi Shevchenko , 48 , has hardly maintained a classless society 's life-style since he defected to the U.S. last spring . After being debriefed by the CIA , he has not only enjoyed freedom of movement , but also savored the fruits of capitalism . Using at least four aliases and always trailed in public by a CIA or FBI bodyguard , the Ukrainian has been frequenting Washington 's bars and discos and relaxing at resorts in the Caribbean and Pennsylvania 's Pocono Mountains . For companionship ( his wife Lengina died in Moscow of an overdose of pills after his defection ) , Shevchenko has been leasing the close attentions of an expensive woman who was located through an escort service listed in the Washington Yellow Pages . <P> Last week the cover was suddenly blown off Shevchenko 's pot-of-gold existence . Judy Chavez , 22 , told NBC-TV that the Ukrainian was paying her $5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Corvette sports car and taken her on a whirlwind vacation in the Virgin Islands . In all , claimed the kiss-and-tell brunette , she had received between $35,000 and $40,000 , which Shevchenko had been given by " a high official in the CIA . " Later , at a Manhattan press conference , she added that Shevchenko had paid her in sequentially numbered $100 bills . She plans to write a paperback book , to be published this spring , detailing her experiences with the defector and the kind of security arrangements the U.S. provided him . <P> At the U.N. , diplomats began telling jokes about Chavez 's tale , saying it was a CIA propaganda ploy to induce more Russians to defect . Another diplomat quipped that perhaps there should be a new bumper sticker proclaiming : DEFECTORS HAVE MORE FUN . In Washington , the CIA saw less to be amused about . Director Stansfield Turner explained that while Shevchenko " is receiving compensation from the CIA commensurate with his services and value to the U.S. , " he is getting nothing for a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by observing at his press conference that sums such as those reported by Chavez " would be highly inflationary - contrary to my anti-inflation policy . " Indeed , Shevchenko may have been able to finance his affairs himself : he received $78,000 in severance when he quit his U.N . post and could have saved a substantial amount from his $87,000 annual U.N . salary .
