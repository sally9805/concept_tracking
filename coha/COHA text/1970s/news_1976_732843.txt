txt " COME ON OUT of your shell , baby , " Jim Moran cooed seductively to the lady on his arm . The lady  --  Fat Mimi by name  --  flashed her claws . But soon she began crawling all over Moran , working herself into such a state that she fell onto a , table . What a gal . Eyes like stalks of grain . Not one but two long , slender noses attractively testing the air . And six of the tastiest-looking legs you ever saw . I should say here that , although Moran is certainly different , folks , and he 's done some different strokes , the affair ? d'Mimi was not what you might think . This was only a charming bit of Americana , one that Norman Rockwell would paint under the simple tiU* " A body and his crab . " FAT MIMI Is just one of 49 hermit crabs Moran brought to Chicago this week , stabling them on the 18th floor of the Continental Plaza . He has 200,000 more at home . Moran , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks you should be , too . So he is marketing them as " Crazy Crabs . " They come In little carrying cases , with complete instructions for their care , and Moran predicts they 'll be far bigger and more enduring , not as individual crabs but as a movement than pet rocks . AU right . You 're probably asking , " Who is Jim Moran and why Is he trying to sell me a crab ? " A fair question . Moran , as It happens , Close-up With Jeff Lyon s the uncrowned king of madman public relations in this country. , HE ONCE SPENT three months in Alaska to accomplish his goal of selling a refrigerator to an Eskimo . Ile promoted Father 's Day by sitting on an ostrich egg for 21 days until it hatched . He has tried catching a whale by salting its tail , taken a bull into a china shop , and publicized the movie " The Mouse That Roared " by establishing a Duchy of Grand Fenwick embassy in Washington and inviting hundreds of unwitting socialites to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steve Allen and Jack Paar shows . I first met him three years ago when he was promoting " That 's Entertainment " with two tap dancers hoofing up Michigan Avenue at noon . BUT NOW lie has outdone himself . At the age of 69 he has invested $100,000 and is trekking across the country in a scheme to sell pets that ca n't even throw 14 on the rug . ? " They are amazing little creatures and should interest anyone who loves the oddities of nature , " said Moran of his crabs . " They have been tested by the government and found free of salmonella or other things turtles have . They are very gentle , shy creatures  --  nothing vicious about them . And I find them affection . ate . I have one called Frederick the Great at home . I rub his head , and he seems to love that . " Moran was showing his private collection of hermit crabs for me-14 of them , housed in a plastic tray . Most of them had crawled up two wire  --  screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew gently on its shell opening . That 's how you get them to come out . Buster peeked out , his antennae waving , then scooted across the table . The heavy shell on his back gave him the appearance of a tiny sultan under a huge turban . " I did n't go into this without researching it carefully and , I would say , conservatively , " Moran said . " I test-sold in two cities . I got myself a barker 's outfit and went out on the street . I sold more than 100 a day at 53.09 apiece . If they 're displayed right , we can sell a million . " Moran said both the Ben Franklin and Woolworth chains , which have nearly 10,000 stores , have ordered Crazy Crabs . Ile plans to offer them in 50 major markets eventually . THIS WEEK he delivered his first 100,000 Crazy Crabs  --  right here in Chicago , proving once again that our town takes a back seat to no one . Hermit crabs , Moran tells me , are land creatures that form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shells from deceased snails and other crustaceans instead . They breathe air , drink fresh water , and eat fruits and vegetables but no meat . Moran feeds his crabs corn flakes and coconut  --  and he soon will market a feed formula called " Crazy Crab Crunch . " They come from the Caribbean , where Moran has two men gathering them for shipment north to his " greenhouse " in New Jersey . They live , he said , to be at least 50 years old and are very hardy . " In my butler 's pantry 1 have a 10-foot-long double sink . In one half I had six inches of a heavy concentrate made Close-up of amnonia and glycerine . One morning I found a crab named Captain Nemo walking around in the bottom of this green geop . I thought it would be the end of him , but he 's fine . " THE GREEN GOOP , Incidentally , was for Moran 's hobby  --  a study of soap bubbles . " They fascinate me . I 'm interested in the mathematics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on them . " Moran explained that he first got interested in hermit crabs 10 years ago when he watched some British Hondurans play a bizarre version of the old shell game . A circle was drwan , cups were placed over hermit crabs , and bets were made on which crab would push his cup out of the circle first . " Want to try a game ? Fascinating game , " said Moran , whose hermit crab quickly vanquished mine . " Look , " he said , consoling rne . " I 'm an old crab man . I have to win . Ca n't let a boy step right into a man 's game . " MORAN LED me to the door of his room , past the bathroom , where 26 hermit crabs were clanking noisily in the tub . I was thinking that somewhere in the Continental Plaza is one very bewildered maid .
