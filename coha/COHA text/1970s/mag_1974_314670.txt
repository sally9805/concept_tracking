As if to emphasize the gravity of the economic troubles awaiting the attention of the new Ford Administration , the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the very day of Richard Nixon 's resignation released a set of statistics that showed inflation to be accelerating at an even more explosive pace than had been supposed . The wholesale price index rose a seasonally adjusted 3.7% in July alone , amounting to a compound annual rate of 54.6% . The jump was the biggest for one month since August 1973 , when prices leaped 6.2% after the lifting of the Nixon Administration 's second price freeze . <P> The most ominous trend was a turn-around in farm prices . They had declined steadily from March through June , but July wholesale food and feed prices soared 6.4% , or 110.9% at an annual compound rate . The rise will surely push up supermarket prices in another month or two , particularly for red meat and poultry . Future prospects depend largely on the weather ; the July jump reflected the early effects of the searing Midwestern drought ( TIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But bad news was not confined to the farm . Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose 2.7% last month , the ninth straight month in which they have increased at a double-digit pace . The index for fuels climbed 5.3% in July alone . Almost all types of machinery became more expensive . Factory prices of automobiles went up 2%-and are continuing to climb : one day after the index was released , General Motors raised the factory prices of 1975 model cars and trucks by an average of $480 or 9.5% , nearly duplicating in a single stroke the $500 in price hikes that automakers posted in five stages on their 1974 models . Indeed of 15 major commodity groups included in the wholesale price index , only one , lumber and wood products , declined , and that dip was not reassuring ; it reflected the sharp drop in housing construction . All told , the wholesale price index in July was 20.4% higher than in the same month last year . <P> The magnitude of the rise came as a shock to Government officials . John Stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that it " has dire implications for the consumer price index . " He fears that it will " accentuate future wage demands " by workers who can see the buying power of their paychecks going down .
