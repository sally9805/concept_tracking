Speaking to a meeting of AFL-CIO price monitors in Washington last week , Price Commission Chairman C. Jackson Grayson made a startling admission : it is impossible for ordinary consumers to know whether increases on the products they buy are legal or not . Indeed , added a top official of the Internal Revenue Service , the widely displayed invitations for customers to inspect " base price lists " are " largely psychological . " Customers who take the trouble to pore through a store 's all-but-unintelligible price lists still have no way of knowing whether any single price increase conforms to Phase II guidelines . <P> The reason is that the Government reviews price increases-as well as wage hikes-by large groups of products ( or workers ) rather than by individual units . Thus , just as some employees may receive pay increases that exceed the 5.5% wage guideline , the prices of some items in a store may go up more than the 2.5% price guideline-so long as " aggregate " or total increases among groups of products ( or employees ) do not violate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , Grayson cited the ultimate aggregate : the Price Commission has already held some 200 firms that account for a quarter of the entire U.S. gross national product to increases averaging only 1.5% over the next year . Another indicator was the index of industrial commodities , many of which are controlled . They rose .3% in December , the first full month after the freeze , compared with an average .5% in the six months before the freeze . As expected , though , there was a much bigger bulge in overall wholesale prices . They went up .7% , largely because of uncontrolled farm prices , which Grayson promised to " look at " as candidates for price ceilings if they continue to rise sharply . He also asserted , with more than a touch of indignation , that hints by some Nixon Administration officials that controls might soon be lifted could be " damaging " to economic stabilization . <P> Customer Ahead . The auto industry drove out last week with a price increase above the guideline . In their second round of rises since Phase II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass along to car buyers the cost of new anti-pollution and safety equipment required under federal law . The ticket price of an average General Motors car will go up about $40 ; other automakers will probably post similar increases . For GM , the industry price leader , the combined hike of 3.4% is about $20 below that planned shortly before the freeze . Thus customers came out ahead under the controls-but not by much . <P> On the wage front , there was a move toward retroactive payments . Some 2,000,000 workers who were unable to get raises scheduled to take effect during the freeze were authorized by the Pay Board to collect them retroactively , with some limits . Workers whose employers had already raised prices or taxes in anticipation of the wage increases , including many schoolteachers , may receive all back wages due them . For most others , retroactive pay will be permitted up to 7% . The decision unfreezes some $1 billion in back pay . The Pay Board had originally voted to ban retroactive payments , but had to change that position after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for those " unreasonably inconsistent " with the guidelines .
