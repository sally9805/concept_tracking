txt FOR THE PAST SEVEN months , West Point cadet Steven Robert Verr has been fighting a lonely war . He is battling the most sacred tradition of the 174-year-old military acad. emy  --  its honor system . Verr , of suburban Brookfield , was convicted Sept. 27 of violating the hon. or code by lying to an upperclassman , and his dismissal was recommended . The code states that " a cadet will not lie , cheat , or steal , nor tolerate any , cadet who does . " He was then taken to a solitary room , isolated from the rest of the school . He says he was harassed , kept under guard much of the day , forced to eat alone , and perhaps worst of all , subjected to West Point 's infamous " Silence " ? only insults and orders were spoken to him . The 19-year-old says his " crime " stemmed from a situation brought about-by older classmates keeping food from him . And Verr ? terribly diSoriented from hunger  --  broke down and cried . He had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his parents had been in an automobile accident . It is for that lie that Verr 's classmates meted out four months of punishment . ON MARCH I , Verr finally won Ms fight against dismissal and was restored to honorable status by order of the superintendent of the military academy . But his peers , the 4,000 cadets , in the corps , have not yet accepted his return . The harassment continues . Verr , bitter and disillusioned , now has decided to break his silence about his ordeal . " They 've made it clear to me what this whole place is about , " he says . " It teaches us to cover things up . The honor system is not realistic . If they really practiced it , they would n't have anybody left here . " Fifty cadets have been charged under that honor system with cheating on an examination in a scandal . Another 21 cadets have resigned . Verr says the academy gives excessive power to the 88 upperclassmen who constitute the honor committee that can recommend the dismissal of a cadet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often abused and cites his case as an example . " These men some honor committee members are dangerous when they think they can go above the law , above the Constitution they swore to defend . What kind of officers will they make ? " VERR SAYS HE FOUGHT his dismissal because " I could n't see leaving meekly . It was n't right . It 's not all bad here , but there 's something wrong with the system . " Verr has seen the system operate at painfully close quarters . For 155 days  --  from-Sept. 27 , 1075 , to March 1 ; 1979  --  the freshman cadet lived in , a barracks separate from ' his classmates , denied all but official visitors . Everywhere he went , except to classes , he was accompanied by a cadet guard . He ate his meals in a side area from the main mess hall , the area where the kitchen help eat . Ills solitary room in the " transient " or separate barracks was ransacked despite the cadet guard at the end of the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a can of shaving cream was hurled into his room , splattering foam on his uniforms . It was customary for upperclassmen to roust him from sleep during the night , lie said . WHEN VERR GOT OUT of the transient barracks on orders from Lt. Gen. Sidney B. Berry , superintendent of the academy , who set aside the findings of the cadet honor committee and a review board of five officers , his troubles did not end , he says . There have been minor hassles . Cadets deliberately bumping against him , knocking the books out of his hands , scuffing his shoes . - Other than necessary conversation in the line of duty , or a hurled epithet from an upperclassman , few in the corps speak to him , he says . Scratched on the walls of the cadets ' latrines were threatening words : " Kill Steven Verr : " It teaches ? us --  -- -to cover things up . " Verr . " " Get Verr . " " The Silence will be returned whether the Supe ( superintendent likes it or not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment of " silencing " a cadet for an honor code violation has been officially abandoned ? by a vote of the corps itself in 1973 . Pelosi spent the last 19 months before his graduation shunned by his peers , who refused to speak to him and who moved away from him whenever he entered a room . Verr says he is being silenced by about 80 per cent of the corps . GEN . BERRY acknowledges that his decision on Verr was unpopular among the corps of cadets , especially its 88 honor committee members . So much so , in fact , that at the request of the cadet captain equivalent to student body president the general went be , fore the full committee on March 8 and 9 to explain his action . On March 12 , cadet William Andersen , chairman of the honor committee , is ' sued a letter to the cadet corps reminding them that cadets have the right " to choose whom we associate with and whom we speak to . " Verr , a small , trim marathon runner , stoically shrugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Aug. 14 , the day of the lying incident , until new , " There is n't too much more those crazy idiots can do to me , " he says . " After a while it does n't matter any more . " He speaks almost in a monotone , keeping his voice under careful control . It is as if he must get the words out after holding them in so long . A FORMER TEACHER at Riverside-Brookfield High School describes Steven Verr as a Jack Armstrong paragon : President of both his junior and senior class , editor of the school newspaper , " A student , captain of the track team , member of a track team that competed aaginst the Soviets in Moscow in 1974 . Verr does not mention these things . He speaks more of his love for long-distance running . The incident of Aug. 14 was partly due to this love . Steven Verr entered West Point on July 7 , 1975 , to undergo " beast barracks , " or , in the recently incorporated euphemism , " new-cadet training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to give them an idea of the discipline that will be required during their four years at the academy . IT IS DURING this time that they learn the honor code . The summer training is run almost entirely by first classmen seniors . Excessive hazing is common , though unauthorized . Pat Schreiber , 19 , who was in Verr 's platoon during those weeks , resigned after new-cadet training to go back to teaching deaf children . " I 've got better things to do with my life than that nonsense , " Schreiber says of his West Point experience . He recalls being forced to sit in the dining room during meal time unable to touch his food because his squad leader liked motorcycles and insisted that the plebes at his table , instead of eating , intone , " Vroom , vroom , vroom ! " until he decided who had " won " the race . " I LOST 15 POUNDS , " Schreiber says . " Another guy in my squad lost 30 . We 'd have official ' weigh-ins ' every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upperclassmen would stuff us . They made me eat a whole jar of peanut butter and a blueberry pie . It never.failed . The rest of the time we got practically nothing and they 'd take food to their rooms so the officers would n't find out . " Schreiber recalls that Verr had a particularly tough time . " Certain guys really got on him . I think they resented it because he was an athlete . Sometimes he horsed around and gave them some lip , but he 's really okay . " Because of his long-distance running , ' Verr had accustomed himself in high school to heavy doses of dextrose and fructose sugar pills for energy . His caloric consumption was well above average . When he came to West Point , he says , his extra-energy sugar supply was taken away . He was still trying to run , as he had at home , 20 miles a day-10 in the morning and 10 at night . " EVERY TIME I 'd try to eat , the upperclassman at my table would say , ' Cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork down . " Getting food , he says , became his total interest . Other plebes gave him some of theirs when they could get away with it , " although they were always hungry themselves . " " My legs were starting to cramp up . I was having trouble focusing my eyes . I could n't read , I had such headaches . I felt my whole body was deteriorating : " Wednesday , Aug. 13 , the plebes were taken on a marching field trip . Verr says he had eaten only milk and cereal for three days . He went up to the field mess line , and was dished out some food . The man next to him accidentally knocked over his tray . He was not allowed a refill . Thursday , back at West Point , he get so breakfast or lunch . He consumed only a salt tablet and half a piece of bread that day . " I was , like , hurting pretty much and sort of staggering when I left the mess ball . I started crying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes down in an effort at control . " I never cried about anything before , " he bursts out , " but this food situation " The first-classmen came up to me end said , ' Mr. Verr , what are you crying about ? ' I could n't tell him I was crying because I was hungry . I was n't bitting on all cylinders , I was n't realizing much at the time , but I knew I Just ' wanted to get to my room . I told him my parents had been In an accident . " The first-clansman took him to the chaplain 's office . Excerpts from a statement given by Catholic Chaplain Thomas J. Curley in the matter of the honor code violation by Cadet Stephen R. ? Verr : " NEW CADET Steven Verr was practically catatonic . I could n't get him to talk . His mouth was dry . . .. The little fellow was in bad shape . ... Recognizing from his statements and appearance a man reacting poorly and strangely to stress , I brought him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Within the hour , Verr says , he Cadet William Andersen : " Verr Knew what he was saying . " straightened out enough to tell the chaplain the truth . At the hospital , according to a written statement by Capt . Joe H. Giles of the Medical Service Corps , " Cadet Verr was under considerable stress and experiencing a marked degree of anxiety . .. Mr. Verr 's perception that he was not being allowed enough time to eat was a reality for him and it should be recognized that denial of food represents a threat to an Individual 's survival . In our culture there are very few times that it Is considered appropriate for a male to cry . Mr. Verr felt that the lack of food would not be an acceptable reason for crying , that he would be viewed by his peers as a child or ' baby . ' " THE LIE therefore , Capt . Giles eon ? eluded , was not premeditated or " conceived to take advantage of his fellow classmates nor escape from responsibility . " Verr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to get enough to eat . Word of the Verr Ile reached the honor committee almost immediately and on Sept. 22 he received official notice that he was to be brought before the committee four days later for violation of the honor code . One of the investigating cadets had been the honor committee chairman himself , cadet William Andersen . The night of Sept. 28 there was a " kangaroo court , " according to Capt . challenged Andersen and another investigating officer of the committee as being prejudiced , both remained for the nine-hour proceedings in an advisory capacity . Witnesses were coached by Andersen , according to affidavits submitted by people there . In the end , the honor committee voted Verr guilty . HE WAS TAKEN to his room , his belongings were thrown together , , and at 4 o'clock in the morning of Sept. 27 , he was marched to the transient barracks and put under guard . He stayed there for 155 days , until the General ordered his release . During that time , he was forbidden to practice his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board each board is comprised of 12 of the 88 honor committee members on charges that Capt . Lincoln termed " so trivial I could n't believe it " ? charges stemming from a fourth-hand " as-toldto " statement submitted by Andersen . The officers ' review board , which reviews findings of the honor committee when requested by a cadet , considered both cases and voted against Verr . The recommendation to dismiss Verr from the academy went to Gen. Berry on Dec. 4 . It is that recommendation that Berry set aside on March 1 . " NO QUESTION that Andersen decided it was Verr or them the honor committee , " says Lincoln , a West Pointer , Class of ' 66. " you begin asking yourself , ' What is this concept of honor ? ' " Cadet William Andersen Is 21 , a strap ? ping , handsome youth from Kingsport , Tenn. , who will be assigned to the crack " Screaming Eagle " 101st Airborne Division when he graduates on June 2 . " Honor is just a necessity , " he says with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the individuals who make it up have personal integrity . " So far this year , under Andersen 's command , 17 cadets have been dismissed from the academy for honor-code violations . ASKED ABOUT the mitigating circumstances of stress and intent , Andersen says both are considered before the committee makes its judgments . Andersen refuses to specifically discuss Verr 's case except to say , " Verr knew what he was saying . " The honor committee chairman admits that he is , less than pleased at the superintendent 's reversal on Verr , " I 'm never happy about having a decision of my own overturned  --  but the supe calls it the way hb sees it . " The " supe , " Gen. Berry , 50 , has set aside the findings in honor code violations only three times in his two years at West Point . " IF THERE IS an honest question as to whether the evidence is substantial , I would decide in favor of the individual , because the individual is more likely to have lasting damage from an error in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The institution is strong . " In the Verr case , Berry said he based his decision on the fact that " there was unconvincing existence of Intent to deceive . Other factors include certain irresponsible conduct on the  --  part of one or two misguided cadets who apparently acted immaturely in response to a less than full understanding of the case . " Is It ? wise , then , to leave the fate of cadets in the hands of immature 21. year-olds ? " I believe this is not too much responsibility being on the honor committee for young fellows who in a year are going to be officers , " the general says . " I admire them . They have good judgment , generally , and compassion . " " WE PUT our Ideals in stark black and white , " the general says in his soft Mississippi accent , " because human vulnerability waters down those stark terms . . . . We simply say , tell the truth . Period . ' " Vert* ? disagrees . " The black-and-whitething teaches you to equivocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you do n't want to tell the truth . Nowhere else do they go to these extremes . " Verr says he will be leaving West Point permanently once the last bugle has blown for the year , on June 2 . He will have secured his academic credits  --  which can be transferred to another college  --  and he will have proved to himself his ability to withstand crisis .
