txt The Appellate Division reversed a State Supreme Court ruling yesterday and reinstated the proposed decentralized school district-lines for Manhattan . In a 3-to-I decision , the Appellate Division overruled State Supreme Court Justice Irving H. Saypol , who had voided the boundaries on Jan. 30 because he said they failed " to create integration and maximum heterogeneity . " The reversal also removed a ban on school board elections imposed by Justice Saypol . Parents are again scheduled to vote March 19 for nine members each in Manhattan 's five districts . However , Michael B. Rosen , ' the lawyer for the parents who filed . the suit , said an appeal would be made to the Court of Appeals in Albany , the state 's highest tribunal . Joseph Monserrat , president of the Board of Education , said yesterday that he would make no comment on the Appellate Division 's decision until he had had an opportunity to study the text . There was a probability that unless the Court of Appeals affirmed yesterday 's decision by March 19 , the elections in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the majority in yesterday 's opinion , said that Justice Saypol " speaks of a requirement of ' maximum ( a word not used in the statute ) heterogeneity ' as though that transcends all other criteria . " To accomplish heterogeneity at the expense of every other consideration might conr ceivably result in that very gerrymandering of which Justice Saypol has accused the Board of Education and which a mere glance at the map shows not to exist . " The challenge to the make-up of the five new school districts that are to replace the present six districts on July 1 was made by four Harlem mothers who are presidents of local parent associations . They were helped by lawyers for Mobilization for Youth , a federally financed antipoverty agency . The parents said that by condensing the current six districts into five to conform with the state 's decentralization law ? the law said each district had to have a daily average attendance of at least 20,000 ? the Board of Education " took a racial imbalance and made it worse . " Justice Markewich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve heterogeneity is a far cry from the inaction of the Los Angeles Board of Education , so found by the California Superior . " Earlier this month , a California judge ordered the Los Angeles school system , the second largest in the country , second only to New York , to present a comprehensive plan for racial integration by June 1 . In addition to dealing with the racial issue , the Appellate Division here overrode Justice Saypol 's contention that a public hearing that was held by the board before approval of the districting plan was " a subterfuge bordering on deception . " The dispute over the validity of the hearing held last Dec. 4 stems in part from what the majority court ruling called the " wishful thinking " of the board . Exception Wanted The original intention of the board was to retain the present six districts because of what ' was stated to be the best racial integration . Even though the state 's decentralization law stipulated that each district must have at least 20,000 pupils  --  which Manhattan 's present districts do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected the . Legislature to grant an exception for the Manhattan districts . However , the legislators refused , and the board subsequently scaled down the districts to five to conform with the law . The argument that the hearing was a fraud because it " was based either on misrepresentation or hopeless expectation of new legislative action " was rejected by the Appellate Division , which said : " While it is said  --  and this is true  --  that no legally permissible plan was submitted prior to the hearing , the entire subject was submitted for discussion at the hearing . " Justice Owen and Aron Steur concurred in the majority opinion . Justice Harold A. Stevens , 1 the Presiding Justice of the court and the highest ranking ' Negro judge in the state , was the lone dissenter . In a brief opinion , he said that " knowingly presenting a tentative plan which is violative of the law is tantamount to the presentation of no plan at all . "                @ @ @ @ @
