I am so ashamed of feeling it , I so despise myself for it , that after the first pangs , which surprise me into recognizing it for what it is , my impulse is to deny it . I would neither control nor purge it , but hide it . But an evil that I hide in myself from myself does not go away ; it rots and spreads , it shapes habits . Habitual envy confirms me in litigiousness and complaint . It spoils my pleasure ; my suspicion that someone is enjoying himself more than I ensures that he is . It impairs my either accepting or exercising authority , and it pollutes both my admiring excellence and my accomplishing something excellent . If authority and excellence are yours , I hate you for having them ; if they are mine , I anticipate your hating me , and this dread disturbs my peace . My safest course is to muddy authority unless I can avoid it and to ignore excellence unless I can spoil it .

Now the causes of our envying and being 14 envied have multiplied and magnified : we Americans are rich and mighty , we talk louder than ever about freedom and equality , we can no longer effectively hide from ourselves our crimes of squandering and exploitation . Envy has become a pervasive affliction , yet it remains obscure . It ca n't be quantified ; it ca n't be legislated against ; it ca n't be denounced by public figures because the denunciation would be dismissible as a symptom of the ill it was meant to cure . Nevertheless , we must try to understand how our ideals and institutions have inflamed envy and to modify these ideals and institutions in such a way as to reduce it ? not get rid of it , for it is here to stay , but try to make it manageable as now it is not .

When envy was taught as deadly fact of life , people knew wits to look for and so could penetrate it disguises and defend themselve against it to some degree . But in thi age of behavioral sciences , merger envy is scarcely even named , esp ( cially not in America . Helms Schoeck , an Austrian sociologist , i his compendious Envy : A Theory c Social Behavior , cites a 700-page boo entitled Human Behavior : An Inver tory of Scientific Findings , publishe in 1964 by two American behaviorm scientists . He quotes them : " Ou ambition in this book is to presen as fully and as accurately as possiblo what the behavioral sciences no know about the behavior of human beings : what we really know , win we nearly know , what we think IN know , what we claim to know .

In the eighteenth century , when economic enterprise was freed from the old pre-Enlightenment restraints and powered with technology , first in England and then throughout the West , the dangers latent in liberal capitalism seemed far outweighed by the enormous riches it generated ; we are now appalled by the consequences of the greed and waste which were also re-leased , and in such movements as environmentalism and consumer protection we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all the free-enterprise world , have been practicing . As more and more egalitarian pressures for change arise , we must be careful each time to ask , How may this change affect the workings of envy ? For any change in social attitudes or customs that is likely to increase envy is as suspect as any change that increases greed , and to identify envy is to loathe it . About that at least there is agreement among all mankind : envy is loathsome , and the envious man is everywhere recognized as a menace to the common good. * EAR THE HEART of the matter is N equality /authority . Why should I look up to you ? Why should I do as you say ? Why should I serve you ? Before the Enlightenment , the answers to these questions were traditional : because I am poorer than you , because I am of lower class , because I am inferior . But , whatever the answer , somewhere in the offing , seldom mentioned yet always present , stood the hard threat : you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't obey . Revulsion against this ugliness of hierarchy was a strong engine of the Enlightenment , which taught people the democratic challenge : I will look up to you , obey you , serve you only if I am persuaded that you are superior to me ; prove it . It taught people to demand that social authority be vested , as it often is in science , only in those who are worthy of it and that those in office should retain their power only as they exercise it well . And who would * The first serious portrayal of Enlightenment envy was made by that apostle of the period who was wiser than he taught ? Diderot , in his short novel &mead's; Nephew . argue against this as the ideal of authority in action ? The obvious trouble with this ideal is the false expectations it creates . In the social , moral world , the meritocratic ideal can seldom be fulfilled , and never for very long . A ruler may be strong , he may be wise , he may be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted by it ; even so , he must constantly make decisions on insufficient evidence , he must err , he must antagonize some of those he rules , and he must disappoint idealists . Now , if I do not like how I am ruled or those who rule me , one good course of action is for me to work to improve the ways in which I am ruled and to select better rulers . But , just as few of those with great power are in fact ideally worthy of their office , likewise few citizens in a huge democracy are , judged by the same ideal , good citizens . By trying to practice democracy 's ideal of earned authority , we see to it that we are chronically disappointed both in our rulers and in ourselves as citizens . - He 's no good ; we elected him ; to hell with the whole thing .

Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire or to obey gladly ? A better way is to give those in authority the benefit of the doubt , to undermine trust in them only as a last resort , and when you move against them to do it fast and hard ? to make a clean distinction between granting them authority and leaving them undisturbed in the exercise of it . ( On the scaffold , with the headsman holding the ax of the people 's will over his head , Charles I of England said , " A subject and a sovereign are clean different things , " and the ax fell . ) We American citizens have done as badly by President Nixon as he has done by us .

This remedy , however , leads to the ultimate disorder of equality . " I 'm as good as the next fellow . Every man a king . No one can have authority over me . I acknowledge no superior .
