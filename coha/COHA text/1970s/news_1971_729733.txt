txt The Nixon Administration was sharply rebuked today by a House , committee and by its own leading authority on hunger for seeking to eliminate federally subsidized school lunches for possibly 1.5 million needy children . These were among developments today that strengthened the likelihood that Congress would order the Administration to reverse itself next week . By a vote of 31 to 0 , the House Education and Labor Committee reported out a measure to . require such a reversal . The size of the vote was regarded as a strong sign that the House would pass the measure easily when it comes up Monday . Economy Reasons Cited And at a Senate hearing an hour earlier , Dr. Jean Mayer characterized the proposed cuts as " mean-spirited . " Dr , Mayer is a Harvard nutritionist who has served as President Nixon 's special consultant on hunger and as chairman of the White House 's 1969 Conference on Nutrition and Hunger . The cuts were called for , he said later in an interview , by the White House 's Office of Management and Budget for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save our money than to take it out of the mouths of hungry children , " he said . The budget office , he said , is pursuing " a narrow , legalistic approach at the meanesli possible level . " In a ' further development , it was learned that at least 50 Senators , including leaders of both parties , had signed a letter protesting the cuts , to be sent to the President tomorrow . Such breadth of sentiment Is taken as a strong indication that the Senate will endorse a House-passed bill in conference , ; also likely next week . The Senate has already passed an earlier , different Administration plan to restrict lunch subsidies for needy children . This plan would have restricted the amount of Federal subsidy . for each lunch but left unchanged the number of children served . After the Senate vote , this plan was changed . The per-meal subsidy was increased , but the number of children was reduced . . This prompted angry assertions that the Administration was giving with one hand and taking away with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . Representative Roman C. Pucinski , Democrat of Illinois , said , " It is amazing the extent to which the Administration rewrites the intent of , , congress . When Congress ' , passes legislation we mean that at should be enforced . " The measure reported out by , ? he committee expressly barred the Administration from reducing the number of children served by the subsidized school ; lunch program . - According to estimates by the Department of Agriculture , i about 600,000 children would , , be eliminated from the program rby the new Federal policy . The ; , Senate Nutrition Committee , I however , estimates the total at 4.5 million . The latter figure is accord with a survey last ; week by the House committee ; ihowing 1.2 million in 39 states . ' Of these , , an estimated total of 400,000 children would be tut in New York alone . That fact I prompted 19 ? members - of the state 's House delegation to send a joint letter of protest today to Secretary of Agriculture Clifford M. Hardin , The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Scheuer , Democrat of the Bronx , requiring reversal of recent restrictions in the school breakfast program . This is a much smaller but rapidly growing program designed for needy children . Dr. Mayer testified at a hearing of the Senate Nutrition Committee on the desirability of free school lunches for all children . This has been proposed by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey , Democrat of Minnesota . Dr. Mayer said he thought such a program would cost as much as $7-billion . " I would hope , " he said , " that we are smart enough not to have to spend $7-billion to buy lunch for all children in order to reach all needy children . " But if the office of man ' agement and budget pressures ? . continue to exercise themselves tin the school lunch program with as much mean spirit as they recently have been exerzised , they will leave us no recourse but to fight for a uni ' versal school lunch program . " The present Federal policy . would permit subsidies only to ' Children of families below the federally defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . " But ' - no one who has followed the issue would have expected the Administration to interpret ' needy ' to exclude people who are poor but not quite that destitute , " Dr. Mayer said later .
