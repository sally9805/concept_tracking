A mutual dependency , tended by financial hajjis to the Gulf <P> Following the path that pious Muslims have trod for centuries , more than a million hajjis ( pilgrims ) have flooded through Saudi Arabia in the past few weeks for annual rites celebrated in the last month of the Islamic year . Observing ancient ritual , they circled the sacred Black Stone in Mecca 's Kaaba , a cube-shaped shrine , and , on Nov. 11 , slaughtered sheep in the valley of Mina to commemorate Abraham 's willingness to sacrifice his son . Now the last of them are departing-and on their heels has come a financial hajji , W. Michael Blumenthal . As U.S. Treasury Secretaries have done since 1973 , Blumenthal over the weekend made his annual visit to the desert kingdom , where he paid his respects to the moneymen who hold more of his nation 's currency than any other government officials in the world . <P> The Saudi hoard has by now expanded to the point where it is almost beyond counting . European and American bankers estimate the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and various investments at the disposal of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency ( SAMA ) , the country 's central bank , and other government bodies-at $70 billion to $75 billion . The sum grows by several hundred million dollars each month , as the Saudis take in more money from sales of their oil than they can spend . <P> Lately , the Saudis have been trying harder to spend . After some false starts , they have settled on a coherent development program . Unlike the Iranis , who plunged into hurried development of a broad range of industries and severely strained their country 's social fabric in the process , the Saudis plan to focus on just two fields , metals and petrochemicals , although on a colossal scale . For instance , at Jubail , a Persian Gulf fishing town 230 miles from Riyadh , the capital , $20 billion is being lavished on construction of a port that will be the hub of a large industrial complex that will absorb another $50 billion by the time it is completed . <P> While such projects will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , the management of the country 's cash will always have vital implications for the health of the dollar and the U.S. economy . At present , about 85% of the Saudi holdings is put into dollar investments-bonds issued by the U.S. Government and American corporations , shares of stock in U.S. companies , interest-bearing dollar deposits in U.S. , European and Japanese banks . And that is perhaps the main reason why the dollar retains what value it has on international money exchanges . Should the Saudis ever decide to switch any substantial part of their investments out of dollars into , say , deutsche marks or Japanese yen , the value of the dollar would plunge disastrously . The pile of dollars that the Saudis in theory could sell is more than twice as large as the $30 billion war chest of foreign money that the U.S. is amassing in order to buy up unwanted dollars and thus prop the price .
