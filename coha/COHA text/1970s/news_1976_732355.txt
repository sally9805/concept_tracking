txt Letters to the Editor pg . 31 Letters to the Editor America and the Concorde To the Editor : As a graduate student in aeronautics , I have more than a passive interest in the Concorde debate , yet I believe the nature of the debate shows that much more is at stake than the future of a few costly SST 's which are already technologically one generation behind the state of the art . The Concorde is surrounded by a maze of economic , ecological , scientific and political issues  --  a microcosm of the complex world that faces every American  --  and too many people are too sure of the solutions to the controversial issues while having never made the effort to understand them . No one can today state Concorde causes cancer with even as much certainty as a meteorologist who predicts the weather one year in advance . The interactions that create and destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere are extremely complex and not yet understood . To say the noise will be devastating to millions is just as unproven . Perceived noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angular position of the observer relative to the aircraft and the observer himself . It is not just tied to the total amount of acoustic energy that is emitted . The only proper way to find the answers to these issues is to test them experimentally in circumstances that truly represent those at issue . Secretary Coleman 's trial period does this for Concorde . Yet the emotional negative reaction suggests that too many people fear the answers and would prefer never to know them . On any of the complex issues in society today the facts must be learned and the truth faced before reacting irrevocably . If , however , the massive emotional reaction to a reasoned decision about Concorde is representative of the American state of mind , I fear the truth will be lost in the many other difficult decisions that face our country now and in the future . PHILIP HATTIS Cambridge , Mass. , Feb. 5 , 1976 Sabbaticals and the U.F.T. To the Editor : The United Federation of Teachers agrees that the grievance-arbitration procedure for resolving employer-employee disputes is rational and necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts of the sabbatical case . The U.F.T. went to court only when the Board of Education refused to go to expedited arbitration on the sabbatical issue . Because time was a real factor and because the board refused to arbitrate in a timely manner , we sought a stay of any board action on sabbaticals . It is not the U.F.T. but the board which refused this traditional and useful method of resolution . As his main reason for denying a temporary injunction ( sought Dec. 19 and denied Jan. 30 ) , the State Supreme Court justice said that teachers would not be irreparably harmed by being recalled . He wrote : " In the event plaintiff is eventually successful , money damages can compensate any teacher recalled to duty . " The ruling was preliminary ; the judge did not rule on the merits of the case . SUSAN GLASS Director of Public Relations , U.F.T. New York , Feb. 6 , 1976 ? ' Unscrupulous Progress ' To the Editor : I applaud the three General Electric researchers who resigned on Feb. 3 to focus attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These men do not blindly resist technology ; they logically oppose unscrupulous progress  --  buying luxuries on credit when not sure of the price . The case has once again been set before us . It is time we shouted " I accuse ! " to those who grossly ignore this issue , who put their selfish interests above the interest of mankind . ROBERT GLUCK Ithaca , N. Y. , Feb. 4 , 1976 ? Imperiled Recyclers To the Editor : Deirdre Carmody 's recent news article " Dispute Flowers Over Garden in ' Village ' " was a timely and succinct analysis of art interesting political situation . The piece neglected to mention , however , that the triangle under dispute at Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Avenue is the site not only of a superb community garden but also of the Village Green Recycling Team . Possibly the largest such volunteer operation in the country , the V.G.R.T. processes sixteen tons of newsprint , To the Editor : It would seem time to blow away two items of pure chaff which have served to confuse the Concorde issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after extended deliberation , decided we would not build an SST . We did this because we thought it not in our own , and this planet 's , more enlightened interest . Any idea that we should not now apply the same standards of life quality to the SST 's of other countries as we applied to our own is like saying we ought to allow import of Turkish opium ( those poppies ) because it would offend the Turks if we did not . We do not like or grow poppies here . and we do not like or build SST 's here . If we are about to change our minds , let 's have a fair catch-up period for our own aircraft industry , or opium industry , if that is the choice . ( 2 ) Are the ears and other sensibilities around the airports of London and Paris so different , and so unreliable , that we must guinea-pig 350,000 people in the Kennedy area , and a sizable number in the Dulles area , to get " the U.S. answer " ? I suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guinea pigs to finance a Gallup-like test group , who could live for a period in London or Paris , and provide all the answers that are now to be obtained from the unwilling , unpaid , unhappy subjects whom our Government has decided to guinea-pig at Kennedy and Dulles . This kind of " testing " ? using others involuntarily to prove or disprove something which we know we would not impose on all  --  goes back to the condemned practices of hideous history and recent revelations . Also , it is curious that as we become enlightened enough to curtail , nationally , our motor vehicle speed to 55 m.p.h. , we flirt with vastly increased air speed , though it involves potentially far greater issues of pollution , of environmental deterioration and of waste . Really , this makes no sense . ETHAN A. HITCHCOCK New York , Feb. 6 , 1976 eleven tons of glass , more than one ton of " tin " and 300 pounds of aluminum each month . In its four years of operation , V.G.R.T. has recycled more than 600 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Village community loses not only a beautiful garden but also one of the most successful recycling operations in the United States . JAMES MONACO New York , Feb. 4 , 1976 ? The Costly General To the Editor : Poor country people here in Mississippi can not expect to understand how the Government spends money . Yes , $6 million for political parties in Italy seems reasonable ; parties cost a lot down here too . But $800,000 to one Italian general , that is expensive ( news story Jan. 30 ) . Comprehensive child health care costs $128 per year per child . We could have provided care to 6,250 children here for one year with that money . Our infant mortality is high . With that money , a few babies might have been saved . We can not afford a statewide P.K.U. testing program for newborns . A few cases of mental retardation might have been prevented with money like that . But one Italian general certainly must be important . I suggest , however , that , even if they understood , not all parents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.D. Jackson , Miss. , Feb. 4 , 1976 To the Editor : I am baffled by both the willingness of courts to attempt prior restraint against the press and the unwillingness of appellate judges to vacate , as clearly unconstitutional , such " gag " orders . In a television interview some years ago , the late Justice Hugo Black addressed the question cl " interpreting " the Constitution with unforgettable clarity . His stated belief was that the Constitution says what it means and means what it says . When , as in the First Amendment , it says " Congress shall make no law ... " it means precisely that , without qualification or equivocation . There being no " unless " or " except " or " until " in the Constitution , no court has the right to interpolate conditions . As for a defendant 's rights under the Sixth Amendment , Justice Hopkins ' references in the Carson opinion to a " fair trial " hardly pertain . The Constitution guarantees , strictly and The Old of Youngtown To the Editor : Shame on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defenseless widow and her children so that they had to flee the town and even the state news story Jan. 29 . For what ? Basically for not being attractive or , failing that , rich . The mournful eyes of the two pretty orphans shown huddled together beside the ravaged Christmas tree reproach me and all other lower-middle-class old people . The young mother of two has one thing in common with the old construction workers and mechanics .. and traveling salesmen and their wives : They are all victims of an implacably competitive society . The American Civil Liberties Union , in supportjng the widow 's inalienable right to . live wherever she can pay the rent , : is also vindicating the old people's. freedom to be crowded out into some trailer camp or urban slum . Justice for all might better be served byrturthering the widow 's ability to earn enough to support her children ' , in more desirable places than the rpokeries where " the elderly flock together to live out their days . " When Gulliver visited the Kingdom of Luggnagg , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . peevish , covetous and dead ? to natural affection . . . held incapable of any employment of trust or profit . . . living like foreigners in their own country . " The Luggnaggians called them Struldbruggs .. Here they are called senior citizens . ' Aux trines , senior citoyens ! K. D. SHAFER New York , Feb. 2 , .1976 ? Why Rents Rise To the Editor : Regarding the news article on the front page of the Jan. 19 Times about a 57 percent rent increase over the last five years as against a 17 percent income increase over the same period : Was any study made of the rent and income increases for the twenty . or thirty years prior to 1970 ? Is it , surprising that rents , once a less , rigid rent control law was passed , should rise more than income to compensate for the previous long-term disproportionate rise in income ( and expenses ) with rents fixed ? Is it not true that tenants occupied apartments they could not previously have afforded because the rent was held down while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected that sooner or later their rent had to rise to keep pace with costs ( related to tenants ' incomes , since both were a free market ) , even if it meant some tenants had to move back to apartments they could have afforded before this artificial subsidy ? THOMAS D. STOWE New York , Jan. 19 , l$76 precisely , " the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury ... " and nowhere employs the nebulous and subjective term " fair . " Traditionally , an impartial juror is a citizen with no vested interest in the judicial proceedings and no associations with . any persons involved . Ignorant and impartial are not synonyms . It is , I think , elitism of the worst sort to presume a kind of universal inability to distinguish between sworn testimony and published interviews and opinions , between courtroom evidence and public rumor . It is also well within the authority of the coiirt to enjoin public statements by attorneys , witnesses and prospective jurors pertaining to the issues at trial ; appellate tribunals have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether prejudice and " passion were so inflamed within a , conmunity that no jury could have been impartial in judging the evidence. , " : ' Every juror weighs evidence in a balance tilted by a lifelong accumulation of attitudes and beliefs . Neither free publication nor censorship is likely to alter his thinking at the eleventh hour . Whether the qucatIbrt at issue be " gag " orders relative , to trials or certain ambiguously worded sections of the pending CriMirial Justice Codification and Reform , Act ( S. 1 ) , the Constitution remains ? as crystal-clear as ever Mr. Justice Black saw it . " Congress shall make tio.law ... abridging the freedom of speech , e.or of the press ... " still contains no-ifs , huts , or saves . Treason , libel , slander , Incitement to riot and denial of due process of law remain charges to he determined on their individual merits . " No law " means no law , and a pnWer assigned or denied by the Constitution can not be assumed or presumedly anyone .
