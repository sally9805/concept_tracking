To his followers , Charles de Gaulle was nothing less than " twice the savior of his country , " and even today the Gaullists are reluctant to entrust the telling of the precious legend to anyone who might tamper with it . Nobody knows this better than French Film Makers Alain de Sdouy and Andr Harris , who ( along with Director Marcel Ophuls ) collaborated in 1969 on the superb documentary The Sorrow and the Pity , an exhaustive and exhausting ( 4-hour-long ) study of a French city under the Nazi Occupation ( TIME , March 27 , 1972 ) . <P> Two years ago , they set out to make another mammoth chronicle , this time of the entire De Gaulle era . " We were exasperated by the veil of veneration thrown over him , " says De Sdouy . The two soon ran into a Gaullist resistance as stubborn and iron-willed as that of the General himself . De Gaulle 's son Philippe refused to see them , telling friends that everything must be done to stop a project that could " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ORTF , which holds a monopoly on World War II newsreels as well as postwar TV newsclips , refused to loan or sell the moviemakers any footage at all until after De Sdouy and Harris had threatened a lawsuit . <P> Despite the Gaullist opposition , Franais , Si Vous Saviez ( Frenchmen , If You Knew ) was finished within 18 months . But even then , the government-appointed censorship board waited for seven weeks before granting it a commercial license . In fact , the license came through only ten days before the beginning of the French elections-too late for the film to have much influence on the voting , but in time to enable the government to refute charges of film censorship . <P> After that , De Sdouy and Harris were all set to release their picture-except that the country 's two principal film distributors , Gaumont and Path , reversed an earlier decision and refused to book it . They were afraid , explained one distributor , that the film " would provoke public disorder . " <P> When Franais , Si Vous Saviez finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proved to be a prodigious ( eight hours ) , three-part history of modern France from the First World War to the death of Charles de Gaulle . Its characters range from French-Algerian " Secret Army " Colonel Antoine Argoud to Communist Leader Jacques Duclos , from a patriotic old Lorraine grocer to a Gandhi-quoting Algerian nationalist . The two film makers , who describe themselves as non-Communist leftists , use all these characters to document their thesis : that libert , egalit , fraternit are more rhetoric than fact . <P> Naturally , Franais , Si Vous Saviez became a center of controversy overnight . The pro-government France-Soir praised it as " exciting " and " excellent , " while Historian Franois Furet attacked it as a " monument of crafty demagogy " that sought to turn De Gaulle " from a savior into a scapegoat . " <P> Such a judgment is hardly fair . The film shows many of the General 's strengths ; the final scene in the cemetery at **25;1237;TOOLONG affectingly portrays the special relationship that existed between De Gaulle and the French people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
