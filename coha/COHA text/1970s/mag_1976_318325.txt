&gt; Since it was created in 1970 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has been busily trying to protect everyone 's health-except , apparently , that of its own employees . The oversight is documented in a draft report prepared by another federal watchdog agency , the General Accounting Office , after visits by inspectors to eleven of EPA 's 60 laboratories . The report says that more than half the 1,329 scientists , technicians and other employees in these labs had been exposed to toxic and other hazardous substances without the safeguard of satisfactory health-monitoring services , which are required by law . One example cited : six employees of the labs at Research Triangle Park , N.C. , experienced nausea , headaches and sore throats after exposure to acid fumes last year , but none were given follow-up medical tests . In a Denver facility , workers were found to be regularly breathing dangerous dust particles and noxious gases . The revelations of environmental hazards in its own labs plainly embarrassed the EPA . But a spokesman insisted : " We recognize the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean up problems . " <P> &gt; Abe Lincoln had many skills , but the New England Journal of Medicine recalls one that contemporary doctors ( and their lawyers ) may especially appreciate . In 1856 , while he was practicing law in the Springfield , Ill. , area , the future President was asked by two physician friends to defend them in a malpractice suit brought by an elderly man whom they had treated for a leg fracture . Though the break eventually knitted , the limb was slightly shorter than before . Briefed by the doctors on the difference age makes in the brittleness and healing of bone , Lincoln dramatically demonstrated the point in court with broken chicken bones . Then Lincoln turned to the plaintiff and said , " Mr. Fleming , instead of bringing suit against these surgeons , you should go on your knees and thank God and them that you have your leg . Most other practitioners would have insisted upon amputation . " The impressed jury decided the case for the doctors and assessed the plaintiff court costs .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
