When Spyros Markezinis was almost finished writing his bestselling history of modern Greece , he decided to end it in the mid-1960s and leave the last chapter unwritten . After all , he was prone to observe , " this revolution will be judged by the way it ends . " Even though a politician , Markezinis was in no position to predict what course would be taken by the military regime of Dictator George Papadopoulos , which overthrew Greece 's constitutional government in 1967 . <P> Now it appears that Markezinis will play a leading role in that unfinished chapter . The Athens-born lawyer and founder of the Progressive Party , a small right-wing splinter group , was named last week by Papadopoulos to be Greece 's first civilian Premier since the junta seized power . At the same time , Papadopoulos requested the resignation of the 13 military men in his Cabinet and asked Markezinis to form a new civilian Cabinet to be sworn in this week . <P> While the move stirred hopes that Papadopoulos would eventually make good on his promise to restore parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relinquishing authority now . " Until the election of a Parliament , " he declared in a statement that was boorishly insulting to his new Premier , " the President is , under the constitution , the only source of power . The Premier-designate is accountable and responsible only to the President who makes the final decisions . " <P> That , of course , will come as no surprise to Greeks . Since pushing through a new constitution last summer , giving himself an eight-year term as President , Papadopoulos has skillfully maneuvered to consolidate his dictatorial powers and ease out his military collaborators . At the same time he has boldly moved to disarm critics who complained about the lack of democracy . Two months ago , he ended martial law , declared an amnesty for political prisoners and announced that parliamentary elections would be held in 1974 . Even the lilting , long-banned music of Greece 's much-loved composer , Mikis Theodorakis ( currently on a U.S. concert tour ) , is being brought out of police-state storage . <P> The move toward liberalization is designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility to Greece 's bid for full membership in the Common Market . With inflation running at 30% , Papadopoulos can not hope to keep the lid on serious discontent unless there is a turnabout in the economy some time soon . Markezinis could help bring that change about . He is a palatable politician who was judicious enough not to attack the junta . He is also a brilliant lawyer , credited with having engineered Greece 's postwar economic recovery in the 1950s when he served as Minister of Coordination in the government of Field Marshal Papagos.
