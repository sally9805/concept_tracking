Ordinarily , a candidate takes the week off during the opposition 's political convention . No point trying to compete for headlines when it 's the other fellow 's show . Last week George McGovern broke this taboo , as he has so many others . Too far behind to give up any opportunities , he spent the week trying to appease some of the political household gods he has offended . <P> Lyndon Johnson came first . The former President had endorsed him perfunctorily the week before , so McGovern flew down to the Pedernales to see if he could stretch the Johnson support a bit farther . He brought Sargent Shriver along , hoping that Shriver 's warmer relations with L.B.J. might help ease the chill of the meeting . At Johnson 's insistence , neither staff nor reporters were invited . Johnson greeted the candidates in ranch clothes and a flowing , whitish Buffalo Bill mane . Sitting in lawn chairs beneath a towering oak as they sipped iced tea , then going inside the ranch house for a steak lunch , the trio chatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : talk to people on the phone for at least two hours every day ; make sure you get a solid nap every day in your pajamas . <P> Courtship . It was more important to court Richard Daley , whose support is crucial for winning the pivotal state of Illinois . As with Johnson , McGovern agreed to meet the Chicago mayor on his own turf , and the candidate was forced to eat a certain amount of crow . He stated publicly that he would work with the Daley organization and not against it-a stance that may hurt him with the independents who are trying to topple the machine . <P> He gave his blessing to the entire Daley ticket , including State 's Attorney Edward Hanrahan , who is under indictment for obstructing justice in the investigation of the killing of two Black Panthers . McGovern can only hope that his courtship of Daley will be considered a pragmatic necessity by his demanding followers . For all that , Daley has yet to make a move to work for McGovern in Chicago . <P> While trying to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . Speaking before 3,500 American Legionnaires at their annual convention in Chicago , he reminded them that he too is a Legionnaire in good standing . " I intend to remain a member of this outfit for as long as I live . You can disagree with me , but you ca n't disown me . " He even waved the flag a bit , reciting a few saccharine lines of Earl Robinson 's song The House I Live In . ( " What is America to me ? / A name , a map , the flag I see. / A certain word , democracy. / That is America to me . " ) But he also defended his policies , getting stony silence when he declared : " General Thieu is not worth one more drop of American blood . " <P> McGovern 's reception at the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Minneapolis was equally frosty . He tried to stir some populist embers by attacking Renegade Democrat John Connally . Noting that the Texan had been searching for a villa in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money goes . " He even assailed Connally 's $300 suits-an ambiguous campaign issue . While it is true that McGovern pays less than $200 for his suits , his running mate wears Pierre Cardin suits and has been on the best-dressed list .
