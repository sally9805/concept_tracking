Michael Chellel , who played the flasher in the NBC comedy special Just for Laughs , has a new act in Hollywood . He has published a map showing the graves of 140 celebrities , including Theda Bara , Humphrey Bogart , Walt Disney , Errol Flynn , Clark Gable and Jean Harlow , who are all buried in Forest Lawn - the cemetery satirized by Evelyn Waugh in The Loved One . Chellel sells about 40 maps a day on weekends ( price : $5 each ) . For $25 more he will arrange to have flowers delivered to cemeteries for fans of deceased stars . Business is so good that Chellel is now giving grave thought to another venture : running organized tomb tours .
