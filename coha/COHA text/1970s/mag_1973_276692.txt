In its day it graced a Grecian banquet table and held perhaps seven gallons of wine . So proud were its makers , the painter Euphronios and the potter Euxitheos , that each signed his name boldly on the front . Even now , 2,500 years later , the calyx krater is not merely the best Greek vase in existence . It is the costliest , having been bought last summer by New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art for $1,000,000 . As of last week , it was also by far the most controversial . <P> The furor began when the New York Times , advancing further in its holy war against the Met , charged that the vase was booty dug up by grave robbers at an Etruscan site north of Rome in 1971 and illegally sold to an expatriate American named Robert E. Hecht Jr . He in turn , so the story went , smuggled the vase out of Italy and sold it to the Met . In 1970 UNESCO adopted a draft prohibiting illicit traffic in art objects . The calyx krater would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy have signed the pact . <P> The Met had originally said the vase came from a reputable dealer who got it from a European collection where it had rested since " before World War I. " With the atmosphere already full of acrimony over Met policies ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) , the museum 's officials were aloof and cautious . The curator of Greek and Roman Art , Dietrich von Bothmer , did admit that Hecht was the dealer . But at first he refused to identify Hecht 's source , adding with either remarkable disingenuousness or extraordinary lack of judgment that the name was difficult to spell and he could n't remember it . Eventually , under pressure , Bothmer produced that hard-to-spell name and some letters by the bowl 's former owner , an Armenian coin collector in Beirut named Dikran A. Sarrafian . <P> Sarrafian , the letters said , had inherited the bowl , then in fragments , from his father , who acquired it " by exchange with an amateur against a collection of Greek and Roman coins in 1920 in London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have settled things . But by now charges and countercharges were shooting back and forth across the Atlantic . Reporters were pursuing Hecht , Sarrafian , Met Director Thomas Moving and a restorer in Zurich named Fritz Buerki , who had expertly repaired the calyx krater for Hecht . <P> Reporters who reached Sarrafian , 68 , found him a little vague . " My interest is in coins , " he said in Beirut . " I care little for vases . " He had really paid little attention to the calyx krater . The pieces had been in a hatbox from 1926 , when his father died , until 1970 , when he consigned the box to Hecht . There were some odd discrepancies in his story . The Met had said that Hecht only got an agent 's 10% of the price . Sarrafian suggested otherwise . The Met said the vase had no missing parts . Sarrafian said there were pieces missing , some as large as a silver dollar .                 @ @ @ @
