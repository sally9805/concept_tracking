The drug has already flooded South Vietnam , and substantial quantities are now turning up elsewhere .

It grows at least 700 tons of raw opium a year and now supplies some 50 percent of the world 's heroin ? a figure expected to zoom to 7o percent in a few years . The bulk of the opium is grown by hill tribes in the Shan State of Burma . They long ago developed their own high-profit cash crop : the poppy , planted in late summer and harvested in winter , from which raw opium is collected . The pungent opium gum has been their trading currency for generations . One pound buys a pig , three pounds a horse ; or it can be bartered for salt , cloth , utensils . Last summer I visited this triborder region with an American narcotics agent . We flew upstream along the course of the muddy Mekong River . On our right I could see Laos , which forms the hub of the heroin traffic flowing south to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand , where opium production was banned in 1958 but whose dissident northern hill tribes grow some 200 tons a year . Then Thailand gave way to Burma , which turns out as much as 350 tons of illicit opium annually . From the plane I could look into the Shan State , almost entirely ruled by insurgent groups , where some 6o,000 farmers cultivate opium . Chinese " Mafia . " Who are the real overlords of this gigantic trade ? Periodically , China and North Viet- A NEW ? AND GROWING ? DRUG THREAT 87  | nam are accused of being the culprits . But the guilt actually lies with two other groups . One is the 6000-man remnant of the Chinese Nationalist forces driven from China in 1949 . These men have entrenched themselves in northern Burma and Thailand as freebooters living largely off the massive opium trade . Well-equipped , heavily-armed , they operate as middlemen and transporters , buying the opium from the hill tribes and reselling it , escorting big shipments , levying tolls on all opium that passes through their territories . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese " Mafia " that now dominates the production side : the refinement of opium into heroin , its packaging and distribution . This syndicate is composed mainly of a clan from China 's Fukien Province , opposite Formosa . Over the years , they left their harsh , impoverished homeland and settled in family groups throughout the neighboring countries , where they soon acquired a reputation as tough , sharp businessmen . Today these groups form a looseknit network . The centuries-old opium trade was mainly confined to supplying Asian opium addicts . But as heroin addiction increased in the States during the 1960s , the dealers began to look enviously at the huge profits raked in by Western crime syndicates . When the U.S. military buildup brought hundreds of thousands of Americans to Vietnam , the Chinese Mafia knew they had a ready-made market at their doorstep . Because of its bulk , its distinctive odor and the complicated ritual involved in smoking it , opium has never been widely used by Westerners . So , starting around 1965 , the Chinese began to seek ways of turning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " khai , " a mixture of the residue of smoked opium , morphine base and aspirin that is probably the most vicious drug in the world . Highly addictive and relatively cheap , it kills a regular user within 12 to i8 months . I saw its terrifying ravages in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , where shacks housing khai dens line a whole street . Inside the dim , filthy rooms , the scene was like a Nazi death camp : men who were little more than skeletons ? mostly Asians , but also a number of Europeans ? sat staring blankly into space . Every half hour they roused themselves to buy another dose of the powdered drug , heat it over a candle in little tinfoil cups , then inhale the fumes through a rolled paper tube . Factory-Made . Khai 's deadliness made it hard to sell to Westerners . For maximum profit , the obvious solution was to move into independent heroin production , bypassing the European middlemen . But while boiling down opium into morphine base is fairly simple , refining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lengthy process that requires experienced chemists .  | ' The Chinese started in the fall of 967 by importing a few carefully selected , highly paid chemists from Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and Singapore to set up clandestine laboratories in the golden triangle . The chemists stayed six to eight weeks , long enough to turn the previous winter 's opium crop into heroin under the intensely curious eyes of their employers . Some of the local Chinese sent their sons to college to study chemistry . Within a few years , the Chinese Mafia knew enough about heroin refining to go into production . for themselves . The results : an estimated 15 to 20 refineries that now nestle under the heavy jungle foliage of the tri-border region . Occasionally , if a laboratory has obviously been pinpointed by investigators , its owner may pull up stakes and move to a safer spot . But most stay put , protected by private guards , remoteness and payoffs to local authorities . Major McBee , a burly narcotics agent stationed in Vientiane , took me to the abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from the Mekong River town of Ban Houei Sai . Its Chinese owner had recently shifted it to neighboring Thailand . Accompanied by the local police chief , we trudged along a narrow jungle path . A few months earlier the police chief had been stopped here by a Laotian army detachment and bluntly ordered to stop snooping around . Now , at a bend in the trail , we came on a blockhouse where Chinese sentinels once guarded the approaches . A short distance beyond , we arrived at the charred ruins of a village . All that remained of the lab were two 5000-square-foot cement floors , some twisted metal pipes , a well and a waterworks . From the size of the installations , this had been a veritable heroin factory , capable of turning out several tons a year . At first , these refineries produced mainly the low-grade purple smoking heroin ( No. 3 ) used by Asian addicts . With a flair for salesmanship , dealers began to peddle the drug in brightly labeled packets bearing their individual brand names : Two Dragons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But as demand among U.S. troops in South Vietnam grew , so did the market for high-grade white heroin . Willing to oblige , refinery owners switched to producing top-quality No. 4 heroin ? 96-percent pure . For the last two years , South Vietnam has been saturated with the stuff , in sophisticated packaging : small plastic vials , some transparent , others in colors . Stamped into the vial top is the grimly humorous label , " Healthy No. 4 " ? evidence that the heroin operators now have their own plastics factory . Carriers and Couriers . The Chinese dealers spread the deadly powder throughout Southeast Asia and overseas via three main networks . The first goes to Bangkok , Singapore and Hong Kong , and thence to Taiwan or directly to America . A second one moves overland to Sai- gon and eventually to ocean drops in the Gulf of Siam . Picked up , it continues to the U.S. east coast ( via the Middle East and France ) , or west coast ( through Hong Kong and Singapore ) . A third route runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Most of the heroin is transported by air ? some of it in the military aircraft of local armed forces , some by small charter lines or private planes that can deliver to out-of-theway airstrips . For ocean drops , 65-pound heroin packages are wrapped in five layers of plastic sheet , sealed inside a metal drum and parachuted into the sea . Marked by a signal buoy , they are easily spotted and picked up by boat . As the heroin moves southward from the golden triangle to the coastal cities , the Chinese networks link up with a new group of dealers : European and American drifters , and veterans and deserters from the U.S. military . These Western operators are channeling increasing amounts of heroin abroad . A major entry point into South Vietnam for the heroin is Tansonnhut airport . In March 1971 , a prominent National Assembly deputy was caught there with almost ten pounds of it ; a week before , an Air Vietnam stewardess coming from Laos had been found to be carrying 20 pounds . Though the heroin entering the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushers recently tried to sell it to members of a visiting Congressional mission ! ) Even outside the cities , narcotics can easily be bought from stalls lining the main roads . One reason for the explosive spread of addiction is the high quality of the heroin . In the United States the drug retailed to addicts rarely contains more than six percent heroin ; it must be injected to produce any substantial effect . The 96-percent pure heroin coming from the golden triangle can simply be smoked or sniffed , and those who use it under the illusion that it is non-addictive often learn the truth only when they are hopelessly hooked . Why has n't this monstrous traffic been smashed ? The answer is complicated ? an amalgam of historically permissive Oriental attitudes toward drugs , the economic necessities of the region , an entrenched corruption that pervades many Asian societies , the political and military realities of the war-torn Indochina peninsula . Although the situation is different in each country , Laos offers a good cross section of the problems involved . One July evening I stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now chief of the Laotian Narcotics Brigade . Across the Mekong , in the gathering darkness , we could see the ferry coming toward us from the Thai bank of the river . The Thai customs station closes at 6 p.m. , but the ferry runs until ? p.m. ? and during that last hour more vehicles cross the border than during the whole rest of the day . The ferry  | docked , trucks rolled off onto Laotian soil , and the air was heavy with the unmistakable smell of opium . But since there was at that time no anti-drug law in Laos , Colonel Sundara could only watch helplessly as the amused Chinese truck drivers rattled past . Last September , as a result of strong American prodding , Laos finally passed a narcotics law that would in theory enable police to halt the opium traffic . How well it will be enforced is another matter . " It is unfair to impose criminal penalties on the opium growers , " an Interior Ministry inspector complained to me . " That 's all they can grow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government opium monopoly , like the French had from 1899 to 1954 , and buy the whole opium crop from us . " American officials disagree that " that 's all they can grow . " In fact , the United States stands ready to help convert the opium growers to other types of agriculture , and to consider buying up their crop during a transition period , as it did in Turkey . But unless a way can be found to bypass Laos officialdom , most of the money would simply end up in the pockets of unscrupulous bureaucrats . Says McBee : " We might be willing to pay . But how much ? And to whom ? " Recently , in northern Thailand and Laos , BNDD agents have begun working with special local enforcement units to interdict the opium and heroin traffic from the golden triangle . Unless these programs are successful , the small but steady stream of Asian heroin now flowing to the United States and Europe will swell within the next few years into a river of misery that will engulf hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of a recent Congressional report , " one of the most formidable challenges to U.S. foreign policy in the coming decade .
