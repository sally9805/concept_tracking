His tie is askew . His third-day shirt has ring-around-the-collar . His thick , wavy clump of dark hair overhangs eyes screwed tight in a lopsided squint , a brow that is permanently furrowed and a leathery puss smudged with unshavable stubble . With stocky shoulders hunched forward at a 45 angle , he looks like an ambulatory cypress stump in baggy brown pants . And the raincoat . The raincoat is an oversized , unhung affair in the last stages of decomposition , scarred and seasoned with the grease of a thousand fingers , its hems frayed and stringy , its pockets attached more by habit than by thread . <P> This one-man disaster area hardly resembles a detective lieutenant of police , much less the hero of a successful television series . But he is both . He is Peter Falk as Columbo , on the NBC series of the same name . Every fourth week , some 37 million viewers tune in avidly to watch him shamble , sniffle , fidget , mutter and gesticulate his way through a case . The fans may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But usually they anticipate their favorite Columbo routines-deceptively plodding , cunningly naive-and see them coming a mile off , which is half the fun . <P> Columbo treats his invariably rich and stylish suspects with politeness , even deference . He apologizes for taking up their valuable time . He prattles incessantly in a New York accent that seems to be coming down with a sore throat . He gee-whizzes over their luxury houses , stopping in mid-sentence to ask ingenuously what the property taxes might be on such a splendid estate , pausing to work them out in terms of his $11,000-a-year salary . His darting , jabbing gestures carve lexicons in the air . He interrupts interrogations to rummage in pockets crammed with scrappaper reminders of marketing chores as well as murder clues . <P> He always just happens to be in the neighborhood , hounding his prey relentlessly , unnerving them , distracting them . Then he walks away . But wait . He turns and takes a few steps back into the room . Here it comes . The zinger . " Oh , excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkin ' , and you know it strikes me kinda funny that ... " <P> Such antics have made Columbo conceivably the most influential , probably the best and certainly the most endearing cop on TV . Which is saying something , since prime-time TV this year is a parlor game of dial-a-cop , a badlands preserve patrolled by a superfluity of sleuths . <P> A crowded police-court docket , said Mark Twain , is the surest sign that trade is brisk and money plenty . The current season would seem to bear him out , with a slight twist . There is brisk betting and plentiful money riding on a schedule that is up to its antenna in crooks and crime , cops and private eyes , crusading attorneys and special investigators . <P> In all , there are 29 crime shows on the network schedules , plus a few in syndication , accounting for roughly 21 of the 63 prime-time hours each week ( last fall 's average total : 16 hours ) .
