EDITH WHARTON : A BIOGRAPHY <P> by R.W.B. LEWIS <P> 592 pages . Harper &; Row . $15 . <P> <P> Edith Wharton has always been seen through a lorgnette darkly . The highest born of all major American writers , she usually emerges from the memoirs looking like a bejeweled dowager in a Peter Arno cartoon-stiff-necked , straight-backed and with all her stays grimly fastened . There is some truth to the image , but only part of the truth , and no such caricature of a woman could ever have written such brilliant novels as The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frame . The lady was indeed a snob , but , as R.W.B. Lewis ' fascinating biography demonstrates , she also had a keen , if delayed taste for the erotic and a fine , hitherto undisclosed talent for dabbling in very unladylike pornography . <P> Born in 1862 to a prominent New York family , Edith grew up in a world of high , narrow town houses and high , narrow minds . As a woman , she was supposed to know enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated was tantamount to being pushy , a sin just below adultery in the eyes of old New York . Judged by those almost Oriental rules , Edith Jones was a misfit , and she was more at home in the library than in the drawing room . <P> Marriage Bed . She spent perhaps too much time in the library , and even by Victorian standards she was unusually repressed and naive . On the eve of her marriage to Edward Wharton , Edith , then 23 , went to her mother to ask about what goes on in the marriage bed . Her mother looked at her with icy disapproval . " You 've seen enough pictures and statues in your life , " she replied . " Have n't you noticed that men are . . . made differently from women ? You ca n't be as stupid as you pretend . " On that subject she was , however , and the marriage was not consummated for three weeks , after which the sexual life of husband and wife virtually ceased . What Teddy Wharton-a handsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloodless arrangement is not recorded , but for years he seemed warily devoted to his unusual literary wife . <P> With a growing private income , Edith concentrated all of her energies redoing her homes on Park Avenue and in Newport . She eventually built The Mount , a mansion constructed to her own perfectionist taste in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts . There was nevertheless plenty of time to write . Edith , who had begun an unfinished novel as a child , sent poems and then short stories to the literary magazines . Her first novel , The Valley of Decision , was published in 1902 , just after her 40th birthday . <P> Modeled partly after Stendhal 's The Charterhouse of Parma , the novel was set in 18th century Italy . But Mrs. Wharton soon turned to her true subject , the world of the American rich and the clash between new and old money . On her native ground she has never been matched , and no other American has ever portrayed so well the sometimes savage drama of life behind the damask draperies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of The House of Mirth in 1905 , she was recognized as a major novelist and , as an aging Henry James grew silent , she took his place as the preeminent American writer , a position she held for nearly 25 years , until the eve of the Depression .
