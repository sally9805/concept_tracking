DIRKSEN : PORTRAIT OF A PUBLIC MAN by Neil MacNeil. 402 pages . World . $12.50 . <P> <P> He was essentially a legislative man , not so much an ideologue as a hierophant of parliamentary procedure . He embodied much that is best and some that is worst-or perhaps silliest-in the American congressional tradition . His talent for the political about-face was acrobatic . Everett McKinley Dirksen , said his Illinois colleague Paul Douglas , " is a man of no principles . " Dirksen preferred to call it " flexibility , " and that kindlier word , which suggests growth rather than knavery , often proved accurate enough to describe his shifts in policy . During his 35 years in the House and Senate , Dirksen was isolationist , internationalist , champion of Joe McCarthy , internationalist again , antiwar critic ( Korea ) , apologist for war ( Viet Nam ) , Goldwaterite , and finally , an improbable shepherd of nearly all the major civil rights legislation of the ' 60s . Toward the end of his life-he died in 1969-it began to seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumpled travesty of Throttlebottom , Pekin , Ill. , Polonius wreathed in consciously self-mocking fustian , a man at once shamelessly sentimental and uncommonly shrewd . <P> Neil MacNeil observed Dirksen 's career for 19 years-the last twelve as chief congressional correspondent for TIME . He is best when narrating the intricate workings of Congress , fondly chronicling the stratagems of cloture and bombast . His portrait is judicious and frequently admiring . Only occasionally , though , does he step back and render judgment : " Using a rhetorical ready-mix of melancholy and country humor , Dirksen mouthed the platitudes of an earlier America as though they were beatitudes , and he sensed himself as the appointed guardian of those values .
