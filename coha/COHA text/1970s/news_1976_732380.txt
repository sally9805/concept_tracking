txt In a highly unusual departure from judicial tradition , 44 Federal judges plan to sue the United States tomorrow for a pay increase . The judges are also seeking thousands of dollars each in damages to make up for what they say was constitutionally inadequate pay for their work over the last seven years . Those suing include district court and appeals court judges The chief judges of two appeals courts are among them . They are represented by former Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg and Intend to sue in the United States Court of Claims here , the court for suits against the Government Chief Judge George L. Hart Jr . of the Federal District Court here announced the move . Apparently , other judges from the 44 were announcing it in their home cities . Essentially , the judges contend that the President and Congress have violated the judges ' constitutional right to " compensation " by failing to offset adequately the Impact of inflation on their salaries . The Constitution provides that Federal judges shall receive " a compensation , which shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges contend in their ** our York a imrs petition that this piovis cn means that the legislative and executive branches are prohibited from reducing " directly or indirectly " the dollar amount of salaries . The provision also means , they say , that those branches of the Government have an affirmative " duty " to ' take action from time to time to " prevent diminishment of judicial compensation resulting from substantial reductions in Lilt value of money " The judges contend that Congress and the President failed to carry out that duty in the // face of the effect of inflation on the judicial salaries that were set in 1969-140,000 for district judges and $42,500 for appeals court judges . By Oct. 1 , 1975 , the judges inflation had reduced the dollar 's value by 34 5 percent . The salaries , they said , were thus worth only $26,200 and 527,837 , respectisely , when computed according to the Consumer Price Index with 1969 as a base year . However , when the judges ' salaries were finally raised , effectivp Oct. 1 , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $42,000 for district court and $44,625 for appeals court . According to the petition , the new salaries . in 1969 terms , are worth only $27,510 and $29,230 in 1969 dollars . Thus , even with the salary increases , the " compensation , " in real terms , was said to be still love rthan it was in 1969 . Each judge asked for damages " measured as the climuniLion ' of his earnings for the entire period since March 15 , 1969 " They also asked for interest , and tor " such further or other relief as this court should deem . just and appropriate . " The petition does not specifically ask for an order setting forth higher pay scales for the future . However , if the court adopts the judges ' theory that their compensation should in- ' chide increments to reflect the ' impact of inflation , it would presumably issue an order requiring such increments in the future ? hence , , , the request for " further appropriate relief . " It is unclear whether such an order would require added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawsuit is not a class action ? Class . actions not being permitted in the Court of  --  Claims . However . as a practical matter , ' it is ; unlikely that Congress would give a raise to some judges and not to the rest of their colleagues . The relatively low pay of Federal judges  --  especially compared with that of some state judges  --  has been a source of complaint for years . Lately , judges have been warning that the low scales threatened both the quality and the independence of the judiciary , by keeping well-trained potential judges away . The judges repeated that point today in a press statement handed out with copies of the petition . However , the judges ' protects , until today , mostly took the form of talk  --  repeated speeches by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger of the Supreme Court , for instance , as well as statements by some Federal judges that they were resigning because they had to make mole money .

Judge Williams said " there was no recruiting " ? judges were simply advised of the suit , informally , or heard about it from fellow judges , and those who wanted to , joined . There were some who heard about it and chose not to join . No one vigorously opposed it , Judge Williams said , but " some judges expressed concern " about using litigation to make their point , and " some felt it would not look appropriate . " The Court of Claims judges who are being asked to rule on the suit are in the same position financially as the appeals court judges who are plaintiffs , receiving the same salary , However , according to Judge Williams , they will be able to hear the case despite the seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of necesisty " devised by the courts earlier . Basically , the rule provides that if all judges would be disqualified under traditional standards , then no judge is disqualified , because otherwise there would be no way to decide the issue . Barrett , information officer at the Supreme Court , said that Chief Justice Burger " has not seen what the judges have drawn up , and so he ca n't comment . "
