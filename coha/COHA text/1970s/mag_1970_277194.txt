There are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just do n't like to see people with helmets and guns . All I can say is go and bleed . . . It is more important to keep law and order in society than to be worried about weak-kneed people . . . Society must take every means at its disposal to defend itself against the emergence of a parallel power which defies the elected power . <P> - Pierre Trudeau <P> THROUGH the week Canada 's Prime Minister , Pierre Elliott Trudeau , pondered the most difficult decision of his career . On the surface , the threat that confronted Canada , hardly seemed to merit the label " parallel power . " Still , the terrorists of the minuscule Quebec Liberation Front ( F.L.Q. ) , with about 100 hard-core members , had openly defied the government by kidnaping two high-ranking officials and threatening to execute them . First , Trudeau called out thousands of armed troops to stand guard in major cities . Then , because he feared that the Quebec separatist movement ( see box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened , he decided to move even more forcefully . At week 's end , he declared all-out war on the terrorists . <P> To combat those who " are seeking the destruction of the social order through clandestine and violent means , " he invoked Canada 's drastic 1914 War Measures Act . Only twice before , during the two world wars , had the act been put in force ; it had never been applied in peacetime . Backing up Trudeau 's dramatic action was a proclamation by his Cabinet that " insurrection , real or apprehended , exists . " <P> The F.L.Q. evidently saw Trudeau 's move as a challenge that could not be ignored . In responding to the challenge , the terrorists amply justified the Prime Minister 's description of them as " a new and terrifying type of person . " Less than two days after the War Measures Act was proclaimed , the terrorists murdered at least one of their hostages and offered little reason to hope for the survival of the other . <P> Tipped off by an anonymous caller , police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the face of the arrogance of the federal government , we have decided to move into action . " With the message was a map that led authorities to a parked taxicab in the Montreal suburb of St. Hubert . In the cab 's trunk was the blood-covered body of Pierre Laporte , 49 , Quebec 's Labor Minister . He had been shot in the head . Still missing was James Cross , 49 , British Trade Commissioner in Montreal . It was Cross who was first kidnaped two weeks ago when his maid unwittingly let two terrorists into his home , mistaking them for deliverymen . For his release , the terrorists demanded $500,000 in gold bullion , the freeing of 23 F.L.Q. members from prison , and safe passage for them to Cuba or Algeria . When the government firmly refused to meet the terrorists ' terms , the F.L.Q. responded by grabbing Laporte from the lawn of his home .
