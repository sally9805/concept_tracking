The silence was deafening in Washington 's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts-as it always is during a performance by French Mime Marcel Marceau . A studious Amy Carter , sitting on her father 's knee , diligently read over the program notes , somewhat unnecessary labor considering the French mimic 's talent for making himself wordlessly understood . After the performance , the presidential party paid a visit backstage . Jimmy Carter pronounced the mime 's work " absolutely unbelievable , " and said he was most impressed with a sketch entitled " Never War Again . " Said Marceau : " This is the greatest honor that could be paid to a Frenchman . " <P> <P> Some might consider Rock Star Alice Cooper to be oral rot personified . Little do they know . Having dabbled with pythons and hanging by the neck , the hairy exponent of amplified Grand Guignol is rooting for pearly whiteness v. yucky blackness on his latest road tour , beginning this week . To that end , Cooper ( a.k.a . Vincent Damon Furnier ) has added four dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a masticating mastodon . Says he : " You can never be too big for oral hygiene . " Fangs a lot . <P> <P> Her birthday happens to be June 16 , the eve of the anniversary of the Watergate breakin , a significant date in the annals of Publisher Katharine Graham 's newspaper , the Washington Post . So many friends wanted to throw a 60th birthday party for her that to avoid confusion or hurt feelings , she threw one herself at her home in Georgetown .

" <P> Newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield has just arrived in Tokyo , but already he may have opened up a new market for publishers of American slang dictionaries . Montana-born Mansfield started off his first official press conference with the declaration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the block . Shoot ! " Blankness crept across the face of Mansfield 's interpreter ; then he recovered . In translation , " new boy " became kozokko , meaning junior apprentice . " Shoot " was simply ignored . That seemed to work , but afterward , some of the more curious Japanese reporters were still politely buttonholing U.S. embassy officials to find out what on earth the honorable gentleman had said . <P> <P> " Do you know what it 's like to be mobbed by 500 people coming at you from different directions ? " moans Rubye Beattie , who does . " I understand why they have Secret Service agents . " Rubye 's knowledge of hungry throngs derives from one striking fact : she is a dead ringer for First Lady Rosalynn Carter . The fortyish Beverly Hills housewife did not really take note of the resemblance until Rosalynn appeared on the cover of PEOPLE magazine last November and friends around the country deluged Rubye with wittily inscribed copies . Now she hopes to get on a TV show or two and has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look-alike ) . There is , however , one little difference between Rubye and Rosalynn , Rubye is a Republican .
