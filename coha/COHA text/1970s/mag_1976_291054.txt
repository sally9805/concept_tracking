In the Democratic cloakroom just off the Senate floor , Hubert Humphrey cracked , " Segretti did it . It had to be one of the dirty-trick guys . ' ' Los Angeles Times Cartoonist Paul Conrad lost not a second in sketching a lascivious Jimmy Carter fantasizing over the Statue of Liberty-undraped . A Californian just back from a trip winked at his wife and announced : " I 've got that Jimmy Carter feeling . " <P> The implausible linkage of Jimmy Carter to lechery stemmed from some afterthought views on sexual mores that the candidate expressed in a wide-ranging interview that will appear in the November Playboy . The result of five hours of interviews given over a three-month period to Writer Robert Scheer , the Playboy article quotes Carter on such substantive topics as U.S. intervention in foreign countries , multinational corporations and the Mayaguez incident . But none of these created a stir. * <P> What riveted the public , in the wink of an eye , was Carter 's use of the words " screw " and " shack up " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he harbors lustful thoughts . With that , the Democratic nominee opened himself to titillating ridicule , bluenose outrage and serious questions about his judgment : should a presidential candidate choose a public forum where he will share attention with busty " Miss November " and a blurb heralding " Much More Sex in Cinema " ? The cover promotion for the Carter story : " Now , the Real Jimmy Carter on Politics , Religion , the Press and Sex in an Incredible Playboy Interview . " <P> Incredible indeed . In discussing sex at all . Carter was attempting to assure Playboy 's presumably hedonistic readers that his own preference for marital fidelity has not given him a holier-than-they attitude . " We are taught not to judge other people , " Carter said of his Southern Baptist upbringing . Then , in a rambling response to a suggestion that he might be a " rigid , unbending President , " Carter declared : " What Christ taught about most was pride , that one person should never think he was better than anybody else . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try not to commit a deliberate sin . I recognize that I 'm going to do it anyhow , because I 'm human and I 'm tempted . And Christ set almost impossible standards for us . Christ said , ' I tell you that anyone who looks on a woman with lust in his heart has already committed adultery. * <P> " I 've looked on a lot of women with lust . I 've committed adultery in my heart many times . This is something that God recognizes I will do-and I have done it - and God forgives me for it . But that does n't mean that I condemn someone who not only looks on a woman with lust but who leaves his wife and shacks up with somebody out of wedlock . " <P> Carter followed this curious intermingling of pulpit and locker-room language with , " Christ says do n't consider yourself better than someone else because one guy screws a whole bunch of women while the other guy is loyal to his wife . " The comments came after the interview apparently had ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemingly unable to shut either the door or his mouth .
