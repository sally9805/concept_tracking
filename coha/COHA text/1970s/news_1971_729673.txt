txt Mayor Lindsay , flanked by police officials , assailed the Federal Government today , for " gross permissiveness " and " gross negligence " in failing to adopt restrictive controls on the sale and possession of handguns . The Mayor , occasionally slapping the witness table for emphasis , told a Senate hearing that New York City and New York State , which have strong gun-control laws , were being " undercut " because the Federal Government and neighboring states did not regulate the sale of handguns . With Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy at his side , the Mayor described how he and the Commissioner had attended the funerals this year of 10 city policemen who had been killed in the line of duty ? eight by guns that Mr. Lindsay said were " illegal . " " My mind went back to all this talk we have heard about ' permissiveness ' in this coun ? try , " Mr. Lindsay told the crowded but quiet hearing room . " What greater permissiveness is there in this country , " Mr. Lindsay went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gunned down eight police officers in my city ? " " No civilized country permits this except the United States of America , " he said . ' Scandal ' Seen At another point the Mayor declared : " It is not only gross permissiveness , it is gross negligence on the part of the United States " to allow the growth of handguns to reach " this scandalous extent . " The appearance was Mr. Lindsay 's first at a congressional hearing here since he switched to the Democratic party . He testified before a Senate judiciary subcommittee headed by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana , a potential Democratic Presidential contender . The subcommittee is considering Mr. Bayh 's proposal to ban the manufacture of cheap pistols , known as " Saturday night specials . " The 1968 Federal Gun Control Act was intended to stop imports of such cheap pistols , but parts , instead , have been imported , to be assembled into poorly made weapons selling at $9.95 to $20 in this country . Mr. Lindsay went well beyond Senator Bayh 's proposal . He proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit the possession of handguns in civilian life to law enforcement personnel " and a few other carefully screened individuals showing special need and authorized to use guns under the strictest kind of controls . " Chief of Detectives Albert A. Seedman estimated that there were about 500,000 guns in New York City , although only about 20,000 pistols were registered with the Police Depart ' ment . Chief Seedman told the hearing that two detectives from his office , Sam Parala and Joseph Gibney , flew to Newport , Ky. , last Saturday and easily bought three pistols and took them back to New York . The two detectives sat silently at the hearing with the pistols in front of them on the long witness table . Nuts Scored ' Commissioner Murphy , who also has advocated a program to disarm the American public , said at one point : " The American people have listened too long to the gun nuts . " Mr. Lindsay said he agreed that " there has to be a national disarmament on guns . " Mr. Lindsay 's comments led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican of Nebraska , who asked the Mayor at one point : " If the majestic State of New York  --  the Empire State with all its wealth and all its resources ? can not enforce its gun laws , what state can ?
