Since the oil-price spiral began 14 months ago , crude prices in the main producing countries have seemed a convoluted mess to Western eyes . At least three different figures could be cited as the price for a barrel of crude . Last week members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , meeting in Vienna , voted ( despite two bomb scares that emptied the hall ) to do away with this arcane setup and start on Jan. 1 a new one-price system . For most of OPEC 'S members , the move means yet another increase in their sky rocketing oil revenues , but this time with a sweetener for customers in the U.S. , Europe and Japan ; the price will supposedly not be raised again for nine months . <P> The foundation of the new plan is a Saudi Arabian government take of $10.12 on the average barrel of Arabi an light crude shipped out of the port of Ras Tanura ; market prices and government revenues on other grades from other countries will be keyed to that figure . Buyers of oil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay no more than now ; those countries , in effect , went up to the new prices in November . But buyers of crude from the other ten OPEC nations , including Iran , Kuwait and Venezuela , will pay to the governments of those nations about 38 per bbl. more , an increase of roughly 4% . The new price will remain in effect until next Sept. 30 - meaning , the producers say , that as inflation continues in consuming countries , the price of oil relative to other prices will actually come down . <P> Old System . The new system replaces one that has seriously misled Western consumers about oil prices . Since producing countries now usually own part of the Western oil companies that operate within their borders and thus part of the oil produced , there have theoretically been three prices for crude . They are 1 ) a " posted " price , which has grabbed headlines but is a hypothetical figure that nobody actually pays , 2 ) an " equity " price , computed on the basis of the posted price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to ship out their share of oil , and 3 ) a " buy-back " price , representing a higher percentage of the posted price , which oil companies pay in order to buy from the government the share of production that the government owns . <P> Oil-owning governments rightly claim that this system has disguised the profits that Western companies make on their operations . It is also certain that the system has disguised just how great have been the price increases forced by the OPEC governments . During 1973 , they quadrupled the posted price of oil , and they have not changed it since the start of 1974 . But this year they have sharply raised equity and buy-back prices . The Saudi government 's take of $10.12 on Arabian light shipped out of Ras Tanura , for instance , has risen about 27% this year , though posted prices have been unchanged ( see chart ) ; since October 1973 , the take has multiplied not four , but five times .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
