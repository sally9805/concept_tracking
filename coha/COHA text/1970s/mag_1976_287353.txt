Fred Silverman knew there was something wrong with the whale in his office . " His voice is too high , " he finally said to an assistant last week . " Get me a whale with a deeper voice . " Then Silverman began auditioning worms . <P> Not many network programming chiefs pass time listening to tapes of worms and whales to find voices for a Saturday-morning cartoon show . But then , Fred Silverman , 40 , is not just any network programming chief . He is , just now , the kingdom and the power , the man who put ABC in Nielsen heaven and gave Charlie 's Angels their wings . <P> In his drive to keep ABC on top , Silverman leaves no worm unturned . He sifts through as many as 1,500 series proposals a season , reads every script and every rewrite of every script , approves every ten-second promotional spot and quarter-page newspaper ad for ABC programs . <P> What makes Freddie run ? For one thing , he seems to have TV tubes implanted in his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former CBS Executive Ethel Winant . Silverman 's father was in television ( he repaired them ) , and Fred was reared in Forest Hills , N.Y. , on Howdy Doody and Clark Kent . He studied communications at Syracuse University and earned a master 's degree at Ohio State . His thesis : a 400-page analysis of ABC programs from 1953 to 1959 . After two years of scheduling movies for Chicago 's WGN-TV , he showered network executives in New York with unsolicited letters , some of them assessing program lineups . CBS eventually took him on . His first triumph was to make Saturday morning profitable for the network by replacing sitcom reruns with new cartoon series . Later , as programming chief , he gave the network such treasures as Cannon , Maude , Rhoda , Phyllis , Sonny and Cher , Tony Orlando and Dawn . <P> Quick-tempered and innocent of the finer social graces , Silverman never moved easily among the Ivy Leaguers and suburban types who run CBS . " Fred 's idea of small talk is the present schedule , and his idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one old associate . " You would n't want to sit next to him at a dinner party . " Silverman was also relatively underpaid at CBS , at about $150,000 a year with no contract . So when ABC offered him $250,000 per annum in a three-year contract to turn it into the hot network , he sprinted across 53rd Street to ABC . The day his defection was announced , ABC 's stock rose nearly 2 points . <P> The bionic programmer now works in a 38th-floor office overlooking the domain of his old CBS colleague Network President Robert Wussler ( they occasionally wave to each other from their windows ) . Silverman arrives at 9:30 each morning and begins rousing his West Coast producers from bed to discuss the overnight ratings . The rest of his day is a marathon of meetings-with soap-opera writers , sitcom producers , cartoon animators , promotion experts , demographics wizards . He returns to his Central Park West apartment for dinner with his wife Cathy and their daughter Melissa , 4 , then holes up in his den with a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassette players , which he watches simultaneously .
