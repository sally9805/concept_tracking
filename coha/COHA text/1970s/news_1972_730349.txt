txt President Anwar ** of Egypt and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya agreed today to set up a " unified political leadership " to work out the unification of the two countries in such fields as finance , education and political and constitutional organization . A joint declaration , read simultaneously with great solemnity by the Cairo and Tripoli radios , made it clear that , the agreement , reached after three days of negotiations in Tobruk and , Benghazi , in Libya , had fallen far short of Colonel Qaddafi 's demand for a merger of the two nations . The preamble of the ' declaration said , " The leaderships of the two revolutions have agreed to establish a complete unity between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Arab Republic of Libya as soon as possible and on the strongest possible basis . " Subject to Veto Under the terms of the ' declaration , the process of unification will take more than a year and is subject to a veto by the national authorities of either country .

It appeared from the declaration that this provision would take effect immediately .

By contrast , there has been no visible enthusiasm for unity here in Cairo , At the time of the announcement , shortly after 8 P.M. , local time , the streets of the business district and the banks of the Nile were crowded with shoppers and strollers who seemed unaware of what the announcer had termed a historic event . Before the joint declaration was read , an announcer of the Cairo radio said that the Egyptian and Libyan chiefs of state had telephoned President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to inform him of their decisions . Partner in Federation Syria is the third partner with Egypt and Libya in the Federation of Arab Republics , which was formed last year and already provides for a federal government , a single flag and a single capital ?

Diplomatic observers pointed out that the declaration assured President Sadat of comH plete freedom of action for more than a year in the wake of his expulsion of Soviet . military personnel . This is thought to be of prime importance to the Egyptians . Colonel Qaddafi , an opponent of Communism and advocate of Arab unity , is thought to welcome the departure of the Russians . But as a passionate advocate of war against Israel , he could become an embarrassing partner during the diplomatic and political maneuvering expected this fall and winter . Egyptian And Libyan officials early last month had reached agreement on a merger of the two countries ' political parties , each named Arab Socialist Union . If the unification announced today is accomplished , it would create a vast nation , the largest in Africa , rich in oil , because of Libya 's contribution .

Syria was linked to Egypt between 1958 and 1961 in the United Arab Republic , a complete union dominated by the President , Gamal Abdel Nasser . Almost all power emanated from Cairo , and Damascus was virtually reduced to the status of provincial capital . That union ended after a military coup in Syria . Subsequent Syrian regimes , including the present one under President Assad , have insisted on complete national independence . This position is known to have been a major factor in Mr. Sadat 's resistance to Colonel Qaddafi 's demands . There had been fears here that the threecountry federation might not survive a complete EgyptianLibyan merger . The consensus among foreign observers tonight was that the Egyptian-Libyan declaration was a compromise between Colonel Qaddafi 's call for a spectacular move and Mr. Sadat 's caution . The declaration accepts the principle of unity , which the Libyan leader wanted , but it sets up a cumbersome procedure lasting more than a year .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
