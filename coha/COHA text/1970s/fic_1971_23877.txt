he twitted Declan about it , but Declan , a tall , thin man , only grinned sadly and said slyly , " I suppose i keeps me out of harm 's way , Paddy . " Which , a Paddy damn well knew , was only casuistry . Some times he grew curious about the guest master o the monastery , of whom Declan talked a good deal and wondered if he had n't an undue influence , bu to answer that question he would have had to ac company Declan on one of his retreats , and he knel he would n't be able to stand all that chanting . I made him melancholy even to think of it . When h , had a day off he preferred to dig himself into hi workshop at the end of the garden and make some thing . In the monastery Declan made another friend who made Paddy think even more of his brother in-law 's strangeness . This fellow Mick Ring hal the religion too , apparently , but of a quite differ ADDY VERCHOYLE WAS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of which brought him in a satisfactory return and would get better with time . Paddy was that sort of man . A bit of a craftsman himself , he did n't like to have anything to do with inferior goods , and would kick up hell with the manufacturer if there was anything wrong with what he sold . He could have been richer , but he might very well have been poorer , and it was n't poorer he was getting . He had married a nice gentle girl whose brother was an accountant , and after his mother-in-law 's death he had suggested himself that Declan should come and live with them . Like most of Paddy 's deals , this one had turned out well . Dec-Ian seemed to have no inclination to get married . Though Kate raked Dublin for suitable wives for him , each prettier than the last , Declan seemed to prefer the company of his nephew and niece .. Though Paddy approved of Declan he thought him a queer fish , and no wonder . At home he seemed sociable enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drink , but every few months he would take a couple of days ' leave and go off to a Cistercian monastery in the mountains , and most mornings he was up first and slipped round the corner to hear Mass . Now , Paddy was a good-living man , and he made no secret of it , but this sometimes struck him as going to the fair . Sometimes ent kind . He was a small man with an eager , over boisterous manner  --  a senior civil servant , who wa : connected with a number of charities , though hi did n't speak too well of the charities . Ring wa very popular with the children , though Padd ' noticed that he never really played with them . In stead , he put on a performance , but this wa intended as much for their mother as themselves Even the performance lie put on for Kale per sonally , though consistent and flattering , didn ' seem right to Paddy . He had a feeling that if h were dealing with Ring in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only when h was talking religion or politics that he seemed t Paddy to he altogether sincere , and then it wt with the sincerity of a fanatic . On either of then subjects he might prove an ugly character to g , into an argument with , and Paddy did n't like a guments that turned out that way . As he had often said to Kate , what was an argument for excel to enjoy yourself ? Kate did n't care much for arguments , one way I another , but she had begun to give up hope Declan 's marrying . Her great friend , Nora Hyne who was a raving beauty , had fallen in love wi him and told Kate that she 'd marry him at tl drop of a hat , but when Kate hinted at this to De Ian , he only gave his sad smile and said , " Nora Declan only smiled faintly . They had a drink in Glendalough and then drove on to another favorite haunt of his , Kilkenny , where first he showed them the old churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who bottled his own whiskey , and kept a collection of antiques . " I suppose you 'd say this was a better place than Glendalough , Mick ? " he asked . " A man could have a damn good life in a town like this , " said Ring . " Better than Kerry ? " Declan asked , almost with malice . " No . " Ring said , his eyes beginning to sparkle . " Because here you 'd have gentry and shopkeepers and working-class people . In Kerry you have a chance of discovering that there 's only people . " " I do n't see what you have against Dublin so , " said Declan . " I never said I had anything against Dublin , " said Ring , " but if you want to know , in Dublin it 's nearly impossible to see anything . You never saw anything . " " / did n't ? " " No , you were too damn concerned with your old books and your old job . You should have come to the hostel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell by three pounds he borrowed from an old woman in Mabbot Street at seventy-five per cent per annum . And mind you , when you borrow money at that rate it 's no use going to a lawyer . I did n't go to a lawyer . " " What did you do ? " " I went down to the old woman herself . She said , I 'll put my son on you , ' and I said , ' I 'll put my big brother on your son . and he 'll know what it means to meet a man that 's not scared of a knuckle-duster . ' She was a nice old lady as a matter of fact , " Ring continued philosophically . " Before I left she gave me tea and told me she wished she had a son like me . " " But tell me , Mick , " said Paddy , who lured a good argument and did n't see at all where this one was tending , " if Kerry is all that fine , why are the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ? " " Because they 're too simple , Paddy . " replied Ring . " They do n't know the value of what they have . " " I do n't agree , Mick , " Paddy said sadly . Paddy regarded himself as a good Catholic . but a Catholic with a business head On him , and this was a matter he had thought a great deal about . " They leave it because the priests wo n't let them enjoy themselves . A boy and girl  --  damn it , what else is life for ? " " And that 's only more of the romancing , " Ring said violently . " That 's like saying they have to have television . A countryman has no use for a woman only to make his breakfast and keep his bed warm . " Declan suddenly began to get irritated . It was n't often he got irritated , and Paddy had never seen him angry , but he felt that at this moment Deelan was as cross as he 'd ever been . " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " He wants neighbors , " cried Ring . " Mick , a man wants more than neighbors , " sai , Declan . " What does he want , according to you ? " " He wants someone to devote his life to , " sai Declan . " Television ! " snapped Ring . " Now , Mick , it 's not television , " Declan said wit his sad smile . " Och , what the hell else is it ? " Ring asked e ) plosively . " What woman is worth devoting your to ? Did you ever meet one ? " Then Declan really surprised his brother-in-lay " I did . I met several . " " Never mind the several . Did you meet one ? " " Yes . Nora Hynes . " There was shocked silence for a moment . Eac of them knew that it was one of those occasior when intimacy goes a little too far , and nothin can ever retrieve the situation . Paddy felt that thi was a case for Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blazes did n't you marry her ? " " I 'm not too sure she 'd have had me . " " Oh , begod , she would , " said Paddy stoutly . " Then she 'd be making a great mistake , " Decla said . " And that 's only more of the damn television . Ring said with sudden violence . " Give me anotht drink . I need it when I hear people talking lit that . " " Ah , why do you go on saying things like tha Mick ? " Declan asked reproachfully . " Every ms is entitled to his views . " " He is not , " said Ring with his eyes poppin " That 's what 's wrong with the whole world toda people thinking they 're entitled to give their vies on anything , whether they understand it or xi ( That 's not a sensible view , man . That 's something you saw on the movies somewhere . To a countr man all that sort of thing is no more than hung or thirst or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut . " " That might be what keeps him a countryma Mick , " Declan said with as close an approach indignation as Paddy had ever seen . He intervene not because he wanted to get into an argument wi Ring , but because he feared what might happen himself and Deelan got really serious . A nice situ tion he would be in , bringing two novices to a C tertian monastery , and having them arrested on t way for drunkenness and disorderly conduct . " Now , Mick , I think you 're taking it to the fait he said . " I know what you mean , and there 's a lot truth in it , but you 're taking it to the fair . " " It 's all fairy tales . The trouble with townies li you and Declan is that you have so much time your hands for thinking up nonsense . " " Nor it 's not nonsense either , Mick , " said Path " Not altogether . It depends on what you want In life . What a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a man wants is neighborliness , " snapp Ring . " Someone to give him the cup of tea wh he 's dying .
