txt Letters Letters Defense For Yale Students To THE HOME SECTION : I do n't believe I 've ever been as annoyed by an essay encountered in The Times as I am by William Zinsser 's " Letter From Home " April 28 . Granted that the author 's heart is in the right place , as a recent Yale graduate myself I resent that " they " which cloaks me , in his article , and I question the observations upon which this " they " is based . " All are driven . . . by one message : ' Do Not Fail , ' " the author writes . " Where is the human being who is indifferent to failure ? " Are Yale students more " driven " in this respect than any average businessman , housewife , lawyer , fisherman in the country ? Not that I can tell . " Home is where the words Do Not Fail are first instilled and constantly repeated . " In my case and in those of my closest friends this statement is offensive and false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1 , we learned otherwise . " Next month 's graduates have been obsessively bent for four years on measurable achievements ( grades ) . . . " Again , false , false of me , false of my friends . We were not " obsessed . " That Yale students arc overworked I readily grant , but I ca n't see that Mr. Zinsser has addressed this problem at all . Is the answer simply " Do n't work so hard ? " Which term paper should we not bother to write ? Which course drop ? Or how many C 's will qualify us in Mr. Zinsser 's eyes as psychologically healthy individuals ? If Yale students are to take it easier , Yale 's curriculum and requirements will have to change . The proposition of this article  --  if students are overworked , fault their " obsessions " and their " drives , " not the faculty , not the curriculum , not the admission standards of the graduate schools  --  has always seemed to me a half-truth at best , and more probably the self-delusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face . I do n't think anybody profits by the formulas and generalizations collected in the , , tide . What it says is true for tun , - not even for most and certairt :  - -   - -   .... ciat would he obvious to a realer never even seen Yale ? not for all . I welcome reflections by my former teachers and administrators , but let them he better thought out than this one in the future , please . Mr. Zinsser 's article gets a D. I guess that should make him feel emotionally healthy , anyway . DAVID GELERNTER Setauket , N.Y . ? A Simpler Way To THE HOME SECTION : The article , " Do-It-Yourself Solar Fence Heats Swimming Pool . " April 2S is interesting for all of the unnecessary work Mr. Fellows did in arriving at his ideal solution . He could have saved an awful lot of work and about $250 if he had simply bought a couple of gallons of black , waterproof palm for the pool interior . This , with a clear plastic sheet over the pool , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional energy on circulating water to keep pipes from bursting , etc . In science , I suppose , as in art , simplicity is invariably the better way . Mims W. B. DOBROSI.AVIC Manhattan ? Divorced Fathers To THE . HOME SECTION : As a psychotherapist , I have some additional comments on Howard Crook 's article about divorced " parttime fathers " May 5 . Part-time fathers can not ever again expect to play the same role with their children as they did before divorce or separation . In fact , too much time with children , even if it is " just " two weekends per month , may turn out to he harmful to them and to the children as well . I have one patient , for example , age 31 , recently divorced , with an eight-year-old daughter ( call her Susan ) whom he has been seeing every other weekend , from Friday afternoon to Sunday night . His daughter can not , so far . emotionally accept the separation from her father , now away from home over IS months . His love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devote full time to Susan whenever she is with him . But how can he relate to her for a full weekend ? Out to dinner : a show or movie for her level of understanding ; walks in the park ; playing games ; reading ; talking ; watching TV : breakfasts , sometimes lunches : staying over in his apartment ; his adult friends coming over , " interrupting " their relationship . And she still feels lonely and deprived and she wants to sleep in his bed at night a la Freud  --  the ' Electra complex " ) . My counseling to part-time fathers in similar predicaments : Cool it ! You will always he the child 's father , but you can not he his full-time parent anymore , ever again . He is bound to meet surrogate father models when his mother relates to and/or marries another man . The best you can work for is to maintain contact with the child ? call him and he is free to call you . See the child one or two days a month ? parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more infrequently . Devote less time to the child , but when with him , devote full time to him qualitatively . Sense and share his feelings . HERBERT E. ROBB , Ph.D . Pleasantville , N.Y . ? Showmanship Versus Pleasure To THE HOME SECTION : Permit me , please , to challenge the nonentertainers of Lois Gould 's " Hers " April 28 . They are confusing showmanship with sharing the pleasure of their company and breaking bread with their friends . We are a working couple and live in a small apartment with a small kitchenette and a 25-year-old refrigerator . We do all our own housework , and for years we have entertained happily , on the average of once a weak ( and , I might add , been entertained in return ) . We cat roast beef or a curry or baked custard or some dessert of my own invention . Often , one or both of us will have been working at our jobs until within an hour of our guests ' arriva I. How do we do it ? We figure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's neat and clean enough for anyone . We use our silver every day , so it does n't need sudden-death polishing . We invite our friends in small numbers  --  two , four , five , six  --  so we can all sit at the table and really visit with one another . As my husband told me early on , our friends come to see us . We 're not going to spend our time in the kitchen splattering the gravy and " homhe-ing " the torte . We 'll serve a simpler dinner and stay in the living room , Do n't tell us it ca n't be done . We know better . You just have to want to do it , and he less vain about " things " and more sure of yourself and your friends . PRUDENCE HELLER Manhattan ..
