 | carried out in this magnificent city , a landmark in the world . " He turned back to Hollister . " In my capacity as minister of defense , it is my duty to carry out our President 's philosophy along military lines . We are interested in acquiring a big stick . ' " " May I be so bold as to suggest , " said Hollister , " that perhaps you are overlooking the needs of your people ? The money you save on my ordnance could be put to use in other ways . " Aboud stiffened . " May I suggest that an armaments dealer is ill qualified to advise us on the needs of our people  --  especially an arms dealer whose wares could be of interest only to a collector of antiques ? " Aboud pointed a finger like a stiletto at a spot directly between Hollister 's eyes . " I will tell you something , Mr. Hollister , since you are so concerned . The welfare of our people will ultimately be served not by how many peanuts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can work on the world in concert with our neighbors . We intend to be a nucleus , Mr. Hollister , around which other nations on this continent can unite . This is the dream of President Masaba . But first we need resources . El Racor , to the south of us , and Imbawa , to the west , have rich deposits of minerals and gold . We need their natural assets . They need our leadership . " He crossed back to his desk , picked up Hollister 's catalogue , and balanced it on the upturned palm of his hand as if weighing it . He let the catalogue drop , with a smack , back onto the surface of the desk . Then he sat down . " No , Mr. Hollister , we require weaponry of a most sophisticated nature . Not what you offer . That would only lead to prolonged bloodshed . Our neighbors are our brothers . We wish to impress them with our capabilities , not destroy them . " Hollister had heard that line before . Freely translated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trouble was that few people were inclined to allow themselves to be annexed without a fight . Well , if Masaba , Aboud and company were in the mood for war , they would find a way , with or without Hollister 's  | help . And a man 's first duty was to survive . He had a family back in the States to think about . " I 'm not without connections , Colonel , " Hollister volunteered . " I had hoped that my equipment would satisfy your needs . But since it does n't , I think I can reach the people who can provide you with what you want . " What he hoped was that he could make contact with Amalgamated and work out a percentage deal as their intermediary . " It is precisely because we are aware of certain of your connections that we have called you , Mr. Hollister . " " Then will you tell me , Colonel , just how big a stick ' you want to carry ? " Aboud fixed Hollister with his yellow eyes and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hollister sighed . Aboud 's request was too far out of line to be taken seriously . " I 'm afraid you wo n't find nuclear weaponry of any kind on the market through any dealer . " " We are aware of that , Mr. Hollister . " Then let 's quit daydreaming , thought Hollister , and come back down to earth , and maybe I can still manage to unload a few old-fashioned machine guns . But Aboud neither looked nor talked like a daydreamer . " We are a new nation , Mr. Hollister . But we are not backward , nor are we children . We are well aware that there are no nuclear warheads for sale . We did not bring you here to tell us that . " " Then why did you bring me here , Colonel ? " " Because we hoped you might be of assistance to us . You see , we do not intend to buy nuclear bombs . We intend to manufacture them . " " Then you should have sent for a physicist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had come a long way , at some expense , for nothing . He packed his catalogue back into his attache case and snapped it shut . " I 'm afraid I 'm just a peddler . . . of antiques . " Aboud was not to be put off . " We have a physicist , Mr. Hollister.  | We require a middleman . Someone totally divorced from our government , who is capable of making contact with other parties totally divorced from our government . " " For what purpose ? " Hollister asked wearily . " First , I must know whether or not you are interested in our proposition . " Hollister sighed . " I have no idea what your proposition is . " " That is a problem , " said Aboud thoughtfully . " For you see , were I to acquaint you with your role , it would automatically necessitate your acceptance . " Hollister eyed Aboud warily . Somewhere deep inside him an alarm was sounding . Aboud had been building a trap around him . Whether or not it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark had been not so much a fair warning as an ultimatum . He already knew too much . He wondered if he was the first " middleman " to whom the pending proposition had been made . And if there had been others , what had become of them ? Hollister stood up and crossed to the window , stalling for thinking time . He had seen the silhouette of the big uniformed man standing , like a hangman at attentive ease , on the other side of the pebbled glass door to Aboud 's office . He could feel Aboud 's eyes boring into the back of his head . He could sense Aboud 's finger poised over the intercom button that could summon his executioner . " It would appear , " sighed Aboud , " that you are not interested . " He said it almost wearily , as if he had given up hope of finding a man for the job . Hollister knew now that there had been others . " But I am interested , " Hollister said quickly , and turned in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel took a cigarette out of an ivory box and offered one to Hollister . Hollister accepted the cigarette and a light , and silently prayed that the next thing he was about to say would be the right thing to say . He dragged deeply on the cigarette and watched the plume of smoke spiral ceilingward.  | " It all comes down to a question of money . " Aboud smiled . He had at last found a man who was properly motivated . " We can , I think , offer something unique in the way of payment . " Good Lord , Hollister silently prayed , let it not be Cinobar francs . Aboud ground his cigarette out in the big square chromium ashtray on his desk , but he did n't stop reading Hollister 's face for a moment . " We are offering gold , " he said coolly . " Sixteen thousand ounces . " Hollister had barely begun converting ounces into dollars in his mind when Aboud stopped him . " That would be approximately five hundred and sixty thousand dollars on the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what the black market might bring . Of course , your expenses for the operation will be expected to come out of that sum . But even so , the remainder should be sufficient for you to settle all accounts with your creditors  --  unless , of course , you have liabilities which we have been unable to uncover ... " Hollister 's stomach tightened . These people had gone to great pains to learn everything they could about him . " ... and there should still be enough remaining to fall back upon should you wish to enter some other form of enterprise . " Then , thought Hollister , they must also be pretty damned sure that I 'm in a position to get them whatever it is they 're after . " And how will the payment be made ? " Hollister asked . " Ten percent now , " said Aboud . " That should cover your initial expenses . We 'll make the payment in the form of an order for a number of your quaint machine guns . The remainder will be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That sounds O.K. , " said Hollister . He could feel sweat beginning to form in the palms of his hands . " Then you are certain you will wish to proceed ? " He was certain only that he wished to leave Masaba alive . If  | he could leave with a half million dollars into the bargain , then so much the better . " You are offering a very persuasive sum of money . " Aboud nodded . " Yes , of course . It would be the money . That is why we set the price so high . I imagine that sympathy for our cause plays no part in your decision . " " A man who lets himself be guided by principles does n't enter into my kind of business , Colonel . " Or should n't , Hollister thought bitterly . And then he wished he had n't said it at all . Aboud studied Hollister thoughtfully , drumming a tattoo with his manicured fingers on his polished desk top . Then he came to a decision . He made three quick stabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair , waiting for the blow to fall . He sensed a movement of air behind him as the door to the office opened . He watched Aboud rise from his chair , smiling enigmatically . He sensed the presence of another man in the room approaching from behind . He shifted in his chair just enough so that he could catch the doorway to the office out of the corner of his eye . A tall , lean man in a cream-colored suit was closing the distance between the doorway and Hollister . Hollister felt Aboud 's spidery hand on his shoulder . Aboud was looking down at him benevolently . " As far as we are concerned , Mr. Hollister , you are excellently motivated . We have found that men of principle are too often amateurs . " Aboud tilted his head in the direction of the man in the cream-colored suit , who had come to a stop a few paces off to Hollister 's left . Hollister wished he could stand . He felt vulnerable in the chair . But Aboud 's hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place you in the hands of Captain Moai , let me just state that we do not wish to be cognizant of your methods or of your contacts . One of our agents will shortly make himself known to you . Delivery will be made to him at any place of your choosing outside the borders of this country . I wish you good luck . " Aboud let go of Hollister 's shoulder and stepped back ,  | holding out his hand . Hollister rose quickly , relieved to be out of the chair , and accepted Aboud 's handclasp . " And now , " said Aboud , walking with Hollister toward the door , " you have had a strenuous journey and will , no doubt , welcome a good night 's rest . Tomorrow Captain Moai will take you for a drive into the country which , I think , you will find most enlightening . " He fixed Hollister with his yellow eyes . " There is much at stake , Mr. Hollister . We know you will not fail us . " TWO THE SLEEK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently the only paved road in the country . Captain Moai had turned off it and headed north shortly after leaving Masabara , subjecting Hollister to a kidney-jolting twenty-minute ride before he brought his Land-Rover to a stop in the middle of a featureless red-dust wilderness . A single protuberance spoiled the almost perfect monotony of the plain : a huge , circular concrete platform , set almost flush with the ground , a few yards off from where the Land-Rover was parked . A periscope mast with an image orthicon tube for an eye rotated a full three hundred and sixty degrees every twenty seconds , keeping all approaches to the platform under constant **25;0;TOOLONG surveillance . Four sentries armed with automatic weapons patrolled the perimeter of the platform . The platform itself looked as if it might have been the foundation for a fortress . Actually , it was no foundation at all , but the roof of the first nuclear power station in the equatorial region of the continent . In his office in the subterranean labyrinth of the power plant , Dr. Otto Zimmermann took time out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glowing end of an old one . Then he dropped the smoldering butt into an ashtray , without bothering to stub it out . He was a man of unimposing physique  --  runty , in fact . His teeth and fingertips were nicotine-stained . His cheeks were sunken . Years of underground living had given him the pallor of a corpse . But his eyes burned with a zealot 's fire . A comet 's tail of cigarette ash trailed out from between his fingers and settled on his sleeve as he passed a blue-veined hand across the blueprints on the wall and humbly took credit for " this reactor that will one day provide electrical energy , pump irrigation water , and nourish the countryside all around . " He did not bother to note , thought Hollister , that there was nothing in the countryside for miles around to be electrified , irrigated , or nourished . Captain Moai , sitting in a visitor 's chair , looked toward Hollister to see if the foreigner appeared properly impressed . " Of course , " Zimmermann continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will allow me a moment of levity , I will have to say that it was largely on credit that this enterprise was undertaken . " He drew his lips back over large protruding incisors and waited until Hollister had smiled in return . Then he slid his lips back down over his teeth and continued . " This credit came in the form of funds borrowed from the World Bank . And also in the form of plutonium , borrowed from the U. S. A. The borrowed money built the plant . The borrowed plutonium brought our reactor to life . " Zimmermann sucked thoughtfully on an incisor for a moment . Then he pointed his cigarette at Hollister and snapped , like a schoolmaster quizzing a napping pupil , " Tell me , please , Mr. Hollister , what you know about the qualities of plutonium . " " It 's a nuclear material . Refined uranium , is n't it ? " Zimmermann treated Hollister to a look of amused indulgence . " Extremely refined , Mr. Hollister . So extremely refined , and by such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations in the world produce it . " Zimmermann took a long drag on his  | cigarette and tossed the butt into the tray among the others . The pungent odor of the smoldering butts was beginning to unsettle Hollister 's stomach . " It is truly a miracle substance , Mr. Hollister , " Zimmermann continued . " A quantity so small that a man could carry it can provide enough power for this project . . . or for an impressive number of thermonuclear bombs . " Zimmermann allowed himself another cigarette and watched entranced as the smoke mingled with the smoke rising from the ash-tray and drifted toward the ceiling , where it flattened out and spread over the room in a miniature cloud . " Well , Mr. Hollister ? What do you think ? " " I think , " said Hollister , " that you kind of regret having used your allotment of plutonium on the power plant rather than the bombs . " " Not at all , " said Zimmermann reproachfully . " You are interpreting my statement from your standpoint , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armaments . My life has been spent in science . I therefore take a broader view than yours , which is that to a new nation seeking a place in the world , a power plant is just as important as a bomb . But there is no reason why that new nation should not have its bomb as well as its power plant . " " You are a philosopher as well as a physicist , " said Hollister . Captain Moai nodded his unqualified agreement . " I am not unaware of your sarcasm , Mr. Hollister , " said Zimmermann . " But I am a patriot , anxious to be of service to the country that offered me its hospitality and a chance to pursue my work . " Hollister nodded . " Perhaps , then , you 'll tell me what I 've been brought here to do . " " Let me first tell you a little bit more about plutonium ? " Zimmermann was seized by a choking coughing fit . His eyes began to tear . He poured some water from his drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he dumped the contents of the tray into a wastebasket and coughed  | some more until he had cleared his lungs . Then he lit another cigarette . " Plutonium is regenerative in nature . A breeding material . When employed in controlled conditions , it will serve to start a nuclear reactor such as this one , but it will not consume itself in the process , as ordinary fuels will do . " The U.S. Government lent us x number of ounces of plutonium with which to start our generator . Our generator is now operative and has left us , in surplus , almost exactly the same x number of ounces of plutonium with which we began . This is what I mean when I speak of the miracle of plutonium . " " Then , " said Hollister , " it looks like you have it made . You have your power plant . And you have plutonium left over for your bombs . " " Wrong ! " said Zimmermann , chalking up a demerit . " We do not have plutonium for bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your government will lend plutonium to other governments whose goodwill it wishes to court , but only for such benign purposes as we have already used it for . They demand that upon completion of the project , exactly the amount of plutonium that was lent be returned . In this way they control nuclear activity . There is no surplus floating loose . They know how much they lend . They know how much is returned . They know how and for what purposes the plutonium has been used . And they know it has been used only in conformance with their principles and policies . Within the next few weeks we must return what we have borrowed . " " Then , " asked Hollister , " how do you plan to manufacture your warheads ? " " A truly Socratic question , " said Zimmermann , tossing his most recent cigarette butt into the damp ashtray . " And here is the answer : We honor our agreement . Not to do so would be political suicide . We ship our borrowed plutonium back to the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to us. "  | " You mean steal it back ? " asked Hollister incredulously . " Exactly , " Zimmermann replied . " Simple as that , " said Hollister , dismayed . " Relatively simple , " said Zimmermann coolly . " Relative to what ? " asked Hollister . " Stealing the gold out of the Federal Reserve ? " He stood up and began to pace the room nervously . Zimmermann removed a fresh cigarette , as yet unlit , from between his lips and dropped it into the ashtray . " I must warn you , " he snapped , " that you have already committed yourself to this enterprise . It is too late now to turn back . So you will sit quietly and listen carefully to what I have to say . You will sit quietly and you will listen  --  or I shall be forced to ask Captain Moai to remove you . " The idea of being " removed " by Captain Moai carried with it unpleasant overtones of permanence . Hollister sat . " Very well then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he out of the question to attempt to take the plutonium once it has been firmly placed in the hands of the A.E.C. But there is a brief period of time , after the material has left our jurisdiction and before it enters the vaults of the Atomic Energy Commission , when it is vulnerable . We will be able to pinpoint that brief period of vulnerability for you . We will be in a position to do this for you because we will know the day and the time that the shipment will leave this country . We will know the flight number and its time of arrival in New York . All that is required of you or your confederates is that you act on this information at precisely the right moment , and that you make provision for a clean escape . You will succeed . " Hollister nodded . But his thoughts were grim . He took little comfort in their assurances of success . Because succeed or fail , he had committed himself to the performance of an act that was against his country , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had never entered into the realm of treason .  | THREE THE DAY was hot and hazily humid , and there was a buzz of summer insects in the air . The road that followed the outline of the lake was narrow and winding under a dense arcade of trees . Sudden , irregular patches of sunlight , filtering through the branches , camouflaged the contours and curves and made the driving slow . The developers who had laid out the road might have designed it that way on purpose to discourage incursions by strangers . It had been cut through the forest to provide access to the splendid isolated homes set down in acres of woodland along the lakefront . While it could not be posted as a private road , it had been hoped that it would be little used by anyone but the property owners and their guests . The two men in the slow-moving gray Chevrolet were not residents . They were from neighboring Illinois . Or , at least , their license plates were . They had shed the jackets of their business suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Their short-sleeved white shirts were stained with sweat . The man who was driving was especially uncomfortable . He leaned forward over the wheel trying to keep the wet shirt from sticking to his back . He was a big man , with buffalo shoulders and hands so large that they made the steering wheel look like a toy . His companion  --  bespectacled , scholarly-looking , with a large nose and Adam 's apple and a receding chin  --  sat wedged against the door in the little space that remained in the front seat . " This is it , " said the big man as he stopped the car in front of a wall of native stone . His voice had the timbre of a belch . Through the birchwood they could see the house , set almost on the lake . The house was Tudor in style , white stucco and dark beams . There was a wooden dock running out into the lake , and a small figure in a bathing suit at the end of the dock  --  a woman or a girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the labored breathing of the heavy man .  | " A nice piece of real estate , " said the chinless man in honest admiration . " Lot of good it does him . " " What a business , " sighed the chinless one . " You got to look at it this way , " said the heavy man : " She shared the good times with him . She 'll have to share the bad . " With a grunt he reached down and released the hand brake and started backing and turning the car around in the road . " There 's still the daughter , " said the chinless man , looking through the back window at the figure on the clock . " What about her ? " the heavy man grunted . It was no easy job making a U-turn in the narrow road . " It 's a shame she should have to suffer . " " Who says anybody 's going to suffer ? Maybe the whole thing is a false alarm . " He got the car turned around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start worrying about people 's feelings at this stage of the game , you 're going to wind up with a very bad stomach . " " I guess you 're right , " said the chinless one , resigned . " You know I 'm right . " The heavy man shifted into low and started the car back the way they had come . Eva Hollister watched the car turn around in the road and drive away , and she breathed a sigh of relief . They must have been stray tourists . She had been in her bedroom , on the second floor of the Tudor house , when she had seen the car stop just beyond the stone wall . She had experienced a moment of anxiety . She had thought they might be government men . She had n't been bothered by government men for almost two years now  --  not since her last trip abroad with Kathleen , to visit Nick . But the memory of those months of surveillance , of courteous but disturbing question-and-answer sessions , still troubled her . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not now . Not when Nick was trying so hard to liquidate his holdings , clear up his debts , and come home . She went to the dresser and picked up the Polaroid camera she had come for . Then she hurried down the stairs to the dock , where Kathleen was waiting to have her picture taken so that they could put it in a letter to Nick . Kathleen had just passed her fifteenth birthday and was blossoming into beautiful young womanhood . And Nick had n't seen his daughter in so long . FOUR HOLLISTER TOOK his quick little Alfa Romeo Spider around the hairpin bends up the road to his house above Rapallo . He had left the car at the airport in Genoa , as he did at the start of every sales trip . He liked to see it there waiting for him , polished and apple-red , when he returned . Driving it home brought a sense of liberation after hours in an airplane , following a course determined by other men . He handled the car well . One day soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might really do something with his passion for sports-car driving . All the way in on the flight from Masabara to Genoa , with the requisite stops and changes of planes at Addis Ababa , Athens , and Rome , he had reflected on his good fortune . Zimmermann was right . With the information they had provided him  --  Military Airlift Command flight number , place of arrival , time of arrival  --  it would be possible to effect the theft . Getting the contraband out of the country and making delivery would be more difficult , but also possible . The real problem lay not so much in the theft , or even in the delivery , as in the fact that once the material was stolen , American intelligence agents would be relentless in their search for the perpetrator . They would n't give up until they had run him to ground . The plotters in Masabara  | were surely aware of this , which was why their prime concern was that their government be in no way connected with the theft . Hollister knew that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the wall . But they did n't realize that they had unwittingly provided him with an avenue of escape , a way to get home free . And their ultimate payment of a half million dollars in gold had nothing to do with it . With the C.I.A . boys out gunning for him , he would n't be around long enough to enjoy it anyway . What the people in Masabara had done was provide him with a way to erase the black mark against his name at the Pentagon and the lien against him at Internal Revenue . He braked the engine and took the car through the gears around the seven looping curves that led up the mountainside to his house . For the first time in five years he felt unfettered . The first thing he would do when he entered his house  --  before taking off his tie , before pouring a drink , before lighting a cigarette , before sitting down  --  would be to place a call to the United States Embassy in Rome and ask for Walker Jeffrey , the Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence . Jeffrey would arrange for channels to Washington through which Hollister could route his information about the Masabara conspiracy in return for enough ink eradicator to wipe his record clean . He would have to have assurances that the American government would sink the conspiracy in such a way as to avoid implicating him in the betrayal . But there were experts at nonimplication at C.I.A . headquarters , and he would leave that part of it to them . Spraying dust and gravel , he made an exuberant skidding turn into his driveway , and barely missed hitting the little white Fiat parked in front of his veranda . He wondered if Esmerelda , his housekeeper , was entertaining a suitor . He had n't thought to warn her that he was returning . He scrambled out of the car and strode quickly toward the Etruscan-red stucco house . He did n't even stop to take his hand luggage out of the trunk . That could wait . Right now he had a call to make .  | The afternoon was brilliant , with a perfect , transparently blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : the arbored hillside , the crunch of limestone under heel , the sapphire sea below , dotted with its gaily colored boats . If one had to live in exile , there could be no more hospitable site . But it was n't home . Esmerelda was not entertaining in her quarters in the back . She had the front door open for Hollister before he got there . She was big and round , with the soft shapelessness of a pile of cushions vaguely stacked together in a woman 's form . And she had her plump arms thrown out , fingers extended , to welcome him . She held him at arm 's length , head cocked to one side , black eyes surveying him with maternal concern . " You look tired , " she said in Italian . " A warm bath is all I need , " he said . " But first I must make a telephone call . " He nodded toward the Fiat . " I hope I 'm not interrupting something . " She shook a finger at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for me . He 's for you . " " For me ? " Hollister was puzzled . He knew no one who owned a small Fiat . And nobody knew he was coming home on this day . " A Signor Emboa . He said you would be expecting him . " Asidi Emboa stood in front of the window that overlooked the sea . He was a stocky man of considerable physical power , packed neatly into a conservatively cut black silk suit . He stood with his hands clasped behind his back , feet set wide apart , looking out at the sea , but looking at nothing . Coming into the room behind him , Hollister wondered whether Signor Emboa had been standing that way since his arrival several hours before , or if he had assumed the pose of studied nonchalance when he had heard Hollister drive up . " Mr. Emboa ? " Hollister asked . Emboa turned . The face was flat and big-boned , like a boxer's.  | A good middleweight , Hollister thought . The eyes were set deep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hard , opaque pupils . " Mr. Hollister . " Emboa moved toward Hollister , small , muscled hand extended in greeting . Even when smiling Emboa 's face seemed somehow devoid of expression . " I do n't believe we 've met before , " said Hollister warily . " We have a mutual friend . Colonel Aboud . May we talk in privacy ? " Hollister turned . Esmerelda was standing , watchfully , in the hallway just outside the room . Hollister nodded to her . She closed the door . " You came all the way from Masabara ? " Hollister asked cautiously . " Not at all , " said Emboa . " From the Embassy in Rome . " " Your car does n't carry diplomatic plates . " " I am , you might say , attached to the Embassy . But I travel without portfolio . " " Can I make you a drink ? " Hollister asked , crossing to the bar . " Not at the moment , thank you . " Hollister filled a glass with brandy and soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liaison between Colonel Aboud and me ? " " A little more than liaison . I am to be , so to speak , in charge of you for the duration of this endeavor . " Hollister 's hand tightened around his glass . " I understood your people wanted no involvement in this affair . Only a delivery date . " Emboa smiled his dead-eyed smile and said softly , " Let us just say that Colonel Aboud felt the need for some assurance of your continued enthusiasm after leaving Cinobar . " Hollister shook his head . No . He wanted to get Emboa out of the house and make his call to Jeffrey . And he did n't much care if his visitor 's feelings were hurt . " I 'm sorry , but I do n't work well with someone watching over my shoulder . Either you trust  | me to do the job my way or I do n't do it at all . I do n't have room in this house , or patience , at the moment , to entertain longterm guests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need not be concerned . I was not planning to take up residence , " he said softly . " I have been instructed merely to make myself known to you , and our concern for this project , and then return to Rome . When you are ready to make delivery , you will notify me . " Hollister nodded , relieved , crossed to his desk , and took a pencil out of the antique shaving mug on the blotter . He flipped through his Rolodex file and found an empty card . " That 's Emboa ' with an E , is n't it ? " Emboa laid a restraining hand on Hollister 's arm . " We would rather there was no written record of this transaction . At any rate , Emboa ' is a name of convenience just for this meeting . I am not known at the Embassy that way . " Hollister put the pencil down , leaned back in his chair , and eyed Emboa warily . Emboa continued : " You will call the Embassy in Rome , identify yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Documents . When I come to the phone , I will ask if the contracts are in order . You will answer that they require only the signatures . And you will inform me where and when we shall meet for that purpose  --  which will , in fact , be to effect delivery of the materials . You will remember this ? " " I 'll remember . " Hollister repeated the prescribed dialogue as he rose , crossed around the desk and , taking Emboa by the arm in what he hoped would pass for a cordial gesture , guided him toward the door . " If that is all , then , " said Hollister politely , " I wish you a pleasant journey back to Rome . " " Oh ! " said Emboa . " There is one thing more . " He stopped and turned and made a furrow in his smooth brow as he tried to recall what that one thing was . " I was asked to give you a message , for you to call your family . "  | " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to each other by transatlantic phone every few weeks . But since his whereabouts was unpredictable , it was usually he who placed the call . Unless there was some new trouble . . . an illness . . . new surveillance by the government ... ? If Esmerelda had taken the message , she would have told him about it immediately upon his arrival . That meant that Emboa , the intruder , had answered his phone . " Did you take this call ? " Hollister asked with ill-concealed hostility . Emboa remained impassive . " I think it would be most important for you to call them now . " " Good day , Mr. Emboa , " Hollister said coldly . He turned his hack on Emboa , crossed quickly to his desk , spun the dial on the phone , and waited for the operator to answer . He glanced up and saw that Emboa was still in the room . He cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and said pointedly , " I believe our business is at an end for this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to the window and , with his back to Hollister , resumed his disinterested vigil of the harbor . " It is rather a long journey back to Rome . If you will be so kind , I would like that drink now , Mr. Hollister . " " Pronto ? " came the operator 's voice in Hollister 's ear . Hollister glared at Emboa 's back while he gave the girl instructions for his call to the States . Then he put down the phone . The operator would call him back . The chain of communication was being linked together : from Rapallo to Milan , then north across Europe , west across the Atlantic , and farther west still , to Middle America , to the Tudor house bordering on a lake and guarded by acres of privacy . Hollister wanted privacy now ; desperately he wanted it . But his visitor appeared determined not to leave . " I notice you have Campari on your bar , " Emboa said , without turning from the window . " A Campari and soda would be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so kind . " Hollister fixed the drink for Emboa . And another for himself .  | There was just the slightest tremor in his hand as he passed the Campari to Emboa . " You Americans are very strange , " said Emboa . " You are weaned on telephones , and yet an unexpected call will cause you to react in a most provincial way . One might expect some backward tribesman to impute magical powers to a telephone instrument . But an American ? " Emboa shook his head and took a sip of the Campari . " Ah ! Most refreshing . " He turned back to the window . " Tell me . Is your home in Michigan state so spectacularly situated as this one ? " " Maybe not quite so spectacular , " said Hollister , pacing , " but much more a home . " He was about to ask Emboa how he had known that his home was in Michigan when the phone rang . Emboa smiled in what passed for amusement as Hollister pounced on the instrument . A deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hollister residence . " " Who is this ? " Hollister asked anxiously . " May I ask who is calling ? " the voice answered . " This is Mr. Hollister . I 'd like to speak to my wife . " Hollister 's voice was edgy and impatient . " Is the Curator of Official Documents with you ? " the voice at the other end asked . " The who ? ? " And then Hollister felt his hands grow cold and wet around the receiver . Emboa had moved from the window and was standing beside Hollister , smiling solicitously and holding out his hand for the phone . At the other end of the line there was only the sound of labored breathing . Hollister handed the phone to Emboa numbly , as if it were happening to someone else . Through the pulsebeat pounding against his eardrums , he heard Emboa say something about the status of the contracts . And then Emboa handed the phone back to Hollister . Hollister put the receiver to his ear . For a moment there was  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy breathing . He looked at Emboa with murder in his eyes . He was beginning to guess what they had done . Then Kathleen 's young voice came on , full of bewilderment and fright . " Daddy ... ? " " Kathleen ! " Hollister found himself shouting into the phone . " Are you all right ? " " We 're all right , " Kathleen answered with a trembling voice . The sound of a frightened bird . " There are two men here . They have been very nice to us . They say they will leave when you have made good on your agreement with them . " And then her voice broke . " Daddy . . . what 's happening ? " Then there was silence . And then the deep voice of the heavy breather at the other end again . " It 's O.K. , Mr. Hollister . She 's just a little upset . But you got nothing to worry about . We 're pros . " " Where 's my wife ? " Hollister shouted . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's just across the room . " " Let me speak to her . " Hollister felt as if his head were about to explode . " I 'm afraid we ca n't talk any more now , " said the deep voice .. " We have very exact instructions . " There was a click and the line went dead . Emboa had moved away and was standing at a respectful distance near the living-room door . He knew there was a loaded Beretta in Hollister 's desk drawer . He was quite sure Hollister would n't use it . But men under stress do not always act in their best interests . And he preferred not to be standing at point-blank range , just in case . " Remember , " he said quietly , " the Curator of Official Documents . ' That is the key to everything . I shall await your call . " " You sons of bitches ! " Hollister rasped . Emboa shrugged and turned and left the room , closing the door quietly behind him .  | Moments later there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the crunch of tires on gravel . Hollister went to the window with tired shuffling steps , like a dazed old man , and watched the little white car drive off through a blur of tears . Hollister made two more calls that day , but neither of them was to the C.I.A . agent in Rome . The first one was to his family in the house by the lake . The heavy male voice answered the phone again . But he would say nothing to Hollister without first speaking to the Curator of Official Documents . When he learned that the " Curator " was not present , he hung up on Hollister without another word . Hollister 's only consolation lay in the knowledge that he could call every day and , though he would not be allowed to speak to his wife or daughter , he would know by the continued presence of the intruders in his house that his family had not come to harm . The second call Hollister made that day was to New York City , to an Otis Mahon , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be delighted to fly to Milan to discuss a deal worth fifty thousand dollars . FIVE A HAS-BEEN is like a junkie who has lost his connection and spends his days and nights in aching limbo , longing for one more high . Any time of year is hard on has-beens . But summer is a bitch . There is the heat to contend with on top of everything else . That summer , anyone who mattered had escaped to the Hamptons or the Cape . Roy Spencer did n't matter anymore . So he was at home when the call came in that held the promise of one more high , one last sniff of fame . He lay naked and spread-eagled on his belly between clammy  | sheets , trying to stay asleep at 10 o'clock on a Friday morning , with the television on . It had been on all through the night . He slept with it on , volume turned low , an antidote for loneliness . The flickering light from the tube , and the drone of sound , did n't bother him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer opened his eyes . A plump , thirtyish woman with a cotton-candy hairdo and a pneumatic bosom was staring wildeyed at him , mouth agape . Spencer swung his long , bony legs over the side of the bed and , groaning , reached for the phone . The face of the wild-eyed woman dissolved into a scene of neatly arranged furniture presided over by a trim mannequin who advised the woman of the prizes she would win if she could answer the next series of questions correctly . Spencer picked up the phone . " Roy ! This is Arnie , " came the snappy voice at the other end of the line . " What are you doing up so early , Arnie ? " Even thick with sleep and scratchy with years , Spencer 's voice still retained some of that vague , hayseed twang that had endeared him to millions back in the years when he had been everybody 's boy next door . A dozen nightclub comics had sent their kids through college doing impersonations of that voice . Some of them still did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen , Roy . I think I got a picture for you . You got a few weeks open on your calendar the last part of this month ? " " Tell you the truth , Arnie . I do n't have a calendar . " " Well , please check it , " Arnie snapped . " I got a guy hanging on the other line from Rome . " Arnie Grant was one of the top actor 's reps at Artists International , a Hydra-headed agency with a finger in every pie in the entertainment business . It was incomprehensible to him that he should have a client who not only did n't have to juggle his engagements , but did n't even own a calendar . The woman on the television began to scream : short , gasping yelps . It was hard to tell whether she was experiencing pain or ecstasy .  | " You got a broad in there with you ? " Arnie asked , annoyed . Spencer , carrying the phone on its long cord , shambled over to the television and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television . " " Christ ! " said Arnie . " It sounded like she was having an orgasm . " " I think she was , " said Spencer , flopping back on the bed . " She just won a roomful of furniture . " " Well , what do you say , kid ? " Kid , despite the fact that Arnie , at thirty-five , was at least twenty years younger than Spencer , " I got these people hanging on . " " You know I 'll do it , Arnie . What is it , another drunk ? " " Nothing like that , " snapped Arnie . " This could be a big one for you . A kind of role that makes for an emotional reunion with all the old fans . It 's one of those parts you can sometimes hang an Oscar nomination on . " Spencer pouted thoughtfully , pendulant lower lip stuck out in the way that used to make saddle-shoed high school girls sigh . " That would be great , would n't it , Arnie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , I do n't have enough loose change to buy an Oscar nomination . " " If everything works out right , maybe they 'll spring for the publicity money . It would be good for the picture . " " How much are they paying for the part ? " Spencer asked . " Ten bills , " said Arnie cheerfully . " Is that all ? " Spencer asked , disappointed . " Round-trip fare and expenses , of course . " " Sure . " " Well , you see , Roy . It 's really only one scene . No more than just a few days ' shooting . " " You mean , it 's just a bit ? " " Hell , no ! It 's just one scene . But it 's the key to the whole picture . It 's one of those gems people never forget . I think I can get you special billing . " " Why do they want me , Arnie ? "  | " Because , I told you . It 's a key scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An old name ? " " An old name is exactly what it requires . If for nothing else , then for pure promotional value . Wait till you read it . " " And there just are n't many old names around who 'll go for a bit like that . Is that it ? " " You 're not listening to me . There are a couple of people around who 'd give their left testicle for that part . I conned the producers into putting you at the top of the list . Believe me , Roy . I 've got your best interests at heart . " Spencer believed him . Seventeen years ago , Arnie had been a pudgy , aggressive high school senior working after classes in the agency 's mail room . That was when Spencer was still one of the ten top box-office draws in the country . The kid had heroworshiped Spencer so overtly it had been embarrassing . And Spencer had been kind to him , in spite of the fact that he often doubted young Arnie 's sincerity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the rest of the mail-room boys . And one day he was given a desk and a small list of the agency 's less noteworthy clients . Brash , hustling Arnie made a name for himself as a builder of stars . So it was strange when Spencer 's name was added to his list of clients . It was strange because Arnie was the specialist in bright young talent , and Spencer 's career had by this time begun its long downhill slide . What had happened was that Arnie had heard that the agency was going to cut Spencer loose as a losing proposition . Arnie had demanded that they allow him to take Spencer on . He knew there was n't much he could do for Spencer . But he wanted to save him from becoming that most pitiable of all outcasts , an artist without representation . The problem with Spencer was that he had outgrown his roles . As he aged , his face had retained that appealing boyishness which had once made so many girls want to cuddle and hold him .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his middle years . His wild shock of rust-colored hair , now peppered with gray , did not become his time of life . His face , his form , his bearing had not matured . Only the lines in his forehead and around his eyes and mouth had been etched deeper by time . Somehow the only roles he seemed to fit were those of drunks or weaklings . His " image " became a blur . Then the dissolute roles dried up . And he became a memory . " I 'll take the part , Arnie . " " Good boy , Roy . You wo n't regret it . But you 've got to get yourself some new clothes . Contract calls for you to wear your own . " Could you come with me to help me buy them , Arnie ? " " Let me check my calendar . " " I might want to use your charge plate . " " Sure , Roy . " Arnie knew what the problem was . Spencer did n't need Arnie 's charge plate . He needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many years spent in the pampered realm of stardom . There had been so many hands , so eager to do for him , for so long . And now that it was all over , he sometimes found it difficult , even painful , to do for himself . " I 'll check my calendar and call you back . First let me wrap things up with this guy in Rome . " " Thanks , Arnie . " Spencer hung up the phone , crossed to the television set , and turned off the hysterical woman who had just won a ski lodge in Vermont to put her roomful of furniture in . THE LONG , black Cadillac was parked on Fifty-second Street , just west of Fifth Avenue . Otis Mahon , in a gray chauffer 's uniform , sat dozing behind the wheel . He had every right to be drowsy .  | In the three days since he had received Hollister 's call he had flown to Italy and back , with one day of intensive planning sessions with Hollister in Milan sandwiched in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of any stray passersby ? although he did n't expect many people to be out at 1:30 in the morning in the middle of the week in this part of town . He bad his arms folded across his chest , and his downcast eyes were on the chronograph on his wrist , which told him the exact time of night as well as the elapsed time since his men had entered the arcade that cut through the street floor of the building across the way . A walkie-talkie radio , circuit open , crackled static on the seat beside him . Inside the arcade , a panel had been neatly cut out of the glass wall that looked in on the darkened offices of the American Express travel agency . Inside the office , Mahon 's men , in black evening dress with black hoods over their heads , were almost invisible . Lynch moved quickly from desk to desk , rifling the drawers . Webster was in the back , near the safe , bent over an open looseleaf binder , hastily snapping pictures with a Minox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came crackling out of the small speaker on the walkie-talkie slung over Lynch 's shoulder . " Three more minutes . And then , take off . " Lynch glanced at his watch , then pressed the TRANSMIT button on his radio . " Got you . " He crossed quickly to the back of the office and tapped Webster on the shoulder . " Wrap it up . Watchman 's on the way . " Then he knelt down in front of the safe . Webster took two more quick photos , dropped his camera into his hip pocket , shut the loose-leaf binder , and returned it to its place on the shelf . Then he moved over against the wall and waited for Lynch . The safe was built into the back wall of the office . Lynch  | carefully pressed a fuse into the plastic explosive he had already worked into a seam near the lock . " Ready ? " Lynch whispered . " Ready . " Lynch pressed the TRANSMIT button on his walkie-talkie . " All clear out there ? " Mahon 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we come . " Lynch activated the fuse on the explosive . " Let 's go . " Lynch and Webster moved quickly between the desks toward the open panel in the glass , taking off their hoods and turning down their coat collars as they went . They tucked the hoods into the inside pockets of the jackets and stepped out into the arcade : two gray-haired gentlemen in black tuxedos strolling casually through the arcade on the way to their car , returning home from some elegant late-night function . Mahon had the engine idling . As soon as Lynch and Webster had pulled the doors shut behind them he shifted into drive , and the Cadillac moved smoothly away from the curb . " You got about another minute , " Lynch said calmly , and began to pick away at the dried spirit gum around the edges of his gray wig . He was a ruddy-faced man with flinty blue eyes and a thin nose that ran an irregular course down the middle of his face . Mahon caught this movement in the rearview mirror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood . " " Damn thing itches , " Lynch complained , and lifted the front edge of the hairpiece and began scratching his scalp . " Leave it on , " growled Webster , who was moon-faced and button-nosed and tended to sweat around the upper lip . " I got my own hair , thanks . You had some real hair on your head , you 'd be itching too . " " Shit ! " Mahon spat . The stoplight on the corner had turned red . He pulled up to a stop at the crosswalk . There were no patrolmen in sight , but he was taking no chances .  | " Come on , " Lynch urged . " That thing is going to blow any second . " " What for ? To get tagged for running a red light ? " A young man and his girl materialized from around the corner a block down and began walking up the street , stopping to look into the darkened store windows . A taxi cruised past and the driver tooted his horn at the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case they wanted a cab . They glanced np and then turned back to the window . " Christ ! " hissed Webster . " These damn crosstown lights . " In the quiet of the night , Mahon could hear the timers clicking in the traffic-light box near his open window . In a moment the light would be green . That was when the safe blew , with a muffled , flat thump that could be felt as a pressure against the ear rather than a sharp , focused sound . It startled the young couple on the avenue . They cast puzzled looks up at the sky to see if there might be a thundershower on the way . The stoplight turned green . The Cadillac glided across the intersection . An alarm went off , clanging raucously , bouncing echoes in every direction down the silent streets . The young couple looked around , concerned , wondering where the new disturbance was coming from . Then they hurried off , guiltily , as if maybe it was something they had done or touched that had caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the Cadillac north and cruised uptown at a leisurely twenty-five miles an hour , keeping in synchronization with the timed stoplights . He pulled over to a curb in the Seventies , took off his chauffeur 's cap and jacket , made a neat little bundle of them , and tucked them back under the seat . " Get anything good ? " he asked Webster . " How do I know ? I do n't even know what you want the pictures for . I got maybe forty or fifty , though . "  | " I got nothing , " said Lynch sullenly . " You 'd think , a place like that , you could find a few loose traveler 's checks . " " Damned good thing there were n't , " said Mahon , squirming into a dinner jacket . " Your sticky fingers are going to land you back in stir one day . And when that happens I do n't want you working for me . I 'm not going to get myself hung because some clerk somewhere spots a couple of stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , shifted into drive , and continued up First Avenue . At Eighty-third Street he stopped the car again , and Webster got out . " I 'll have the prints for you tomorrow , " Webster said . Then he turned and started down a side street lined with brownstones . Mahon let Lynch out at the subway on Eighty-sixth Street . Then he turned the car east and headed toward the river . He slowed as he approached a terraced apartment building on East End Avenue , and eased the car into the driveway sloping down to the basement garage . " Little night on the town , huh , Mr. Mahon ? " the T-shirted night attendant crowed as he opened the Cadillac door . " You bet . " Mahon climbed out of the car and let the attendant take over . He winced as he watched the garageman gun the engine and race the big car , in reverse , into its narrow parking space . Then Mahon crossed to the elevator and went up to his apartment . The man from the police lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window in the American Express office on Fifty-second Street . He looked up at the detective standing over him and shook his head . There were no prints . The detective nodded and started back through the office , threading his way past the rifled desks . He passed the night watchman , who stood in the middle of the mess chewing nervously on his lower lip . " Nothing , huh ? " the watchman asked .  | " What do you expect ? This was n't done by kids . " Two more detectives were in the back . One was examining the the safe , which was intact except for where the steel had been tortured around the edges of the door . The other detective had just finished talking on the phone . " I do n't think it 's going to be too bad , " he said . " I was just talking to the manager . He 'll be down in about thirty minutes . But he says there 's never anything , of much value kept in the desks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuff like that . The money , the checks , everything worth anything goes , into the safe . " " I guess they realized that too , " said the detective who had been examining the safe . " I do n't understand it , " said the first detective . " A real smooth entry like that . And then their safe man screws up like this . Wrong charge in the wrong place . " " Maybe they heard me coming and got scared , " said the night watchman proudly . The detective looked at him skeptically . " Maybe they were n't looking for what we think they were looking for . " SEVEN ROY SPENCER stood in the plush , ballroom-sized Men 's Shop on the sixth floor Saks Fifth Avenue . His thumbs were hooked in his waistband holding up his trousers . An elderly fitter , who appeared to be genuflecting in a circle around Spencer 's ankles , was marking the cuffs with chalk . The salesman , a thoroughbred in his twenties out of the Ivy League , orbited Spencer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sported a fifteen-dollar haircut . " Perfect , " said the salesman . " You should have been a model . " " Thanks a heap , " drawled Spencer .  | " What I mean is , " the salesman equivocated , " you are a perfect thirty-eight long . " Arnie Grant stood a few feet off , distractedly feeling the fabric of the two suits Spencer had already bought , which were draped carelessly across the top of an antique Spanish oak table . He crooked a finger at the salesman . " Maybe you could make out the bill so we could get out of here as soon as he 's finished . " " Certainly , sir . I 'll just leave Mr. Spencer in Mr. D'Angelo 's able hands . " He crossed to Arnie , folding back the pages of his order book . He propped his gleaming shoe up on a wooden stool and , using his knee as a desk , began to write . After a moment he stopped and leaned his head close to Arnie 's in conspiratorial fashion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I meant was that if it were n't for the cuffs he could have walked out of here right now with those suits . " " He usually has his suits made for him , " Arnie snapped , annoyed . He would n't want it to get around that one of his clients bought clothing off the rack . " We just do n't have time for that this trip . " " Of course , " the salesman said understandingly . " I was just observing that these suits fit as if they were tailored for him . Do n't you think so ? " " I think , " said Arnie " that at these prices , they could have been . " " Well , I hope it 's clear that I in no way meant to offend . It just seems that he is remarkably fit for a gentleman of his years . " Now Arnie was really annoyed . " Are you a fag ? " he asked . A wash of color spread over the salesman 's face . " I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Arnie , " that I in no way meant to offend . It 's just that you sound so much like a bitchy dumb blonde I know . " Suddenly it seemed that whatever he was writing in his order  | book required the saleman 's total concentration . He glued his eyes to the page and gripped his pencil , and finished writing out the bill without saying another word . Across the floor , the fitter got up off his knees , and Spencer departed for the dressing booth to change back into his old sports jacket and slacks . " Sign here , if you will , please , " said the salesman , holding his book out to Arnie but averting his eyes . Arnie scrawled his name and handed back the book . " Remember . We want those clothes ready before next weekend . Mr. Spencer is leaving for overseas . " " As we promised , " said the salesman frostily . He snapped his order book shut and made a little bow with his head . Jesus ! thought Arnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . I 'll bet he is a fag . The elderly fitter hurried across to intercept the salesman and led him aside , whispering animatedly . The salesman cast a puzzled look back at Arnie , then looked toward the dressing room . Arnie smiled to himself . The old fitter had given the green salesman the word . Fitter and salesman lined up , forming a twoman honor guard near the dressing booth , and , as Spencer came out , bade him a properly obsequious goodbye . Spencer looked vaguely troubled as he and Arnie walked off toward the elevator . Finally , he said what was bothering him . " You know , Arnie . I do n't think the kid even knew who I was . " " Sure he did , " said Arnie . Spencer looked relieved . " No kidding . How do you know ? " Arnie pressed the button for the elevator . " I saw the old tailor tell him . " Spencer smiled sheepishly . " You 're a son of a bitch sometimes . You know that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnie . " But I would n't want you to get yourself a swelled head in your old age . It would spoil your look of boyish innocence . "  | Spencer tried to repress a smile . And , in doing so , looked again like the irresistible kid he had been some thirty years before . Arnie laughed , and reached up and punched Spencer playfully on the shoulder . He practically had to stand on tiptoe to do it . The elevator doors were pulled open from the inside by a pretty , apple-cheeked woman with a face like a cherub 's and a plump , middle-aged body straining the buttons of her elevator operator 's uniform . Her blue eyes , which had looked sleepy and bored , turned saucer-round when she saw her new passengers . Then she closed her eyes , as if making a wish , as Spencer and Arnie stepped past her into the crowded elevator . She hung onto her composure until she had sealed the doors shut and had her prize neatly trapped inside her gilt-and-mirrored cage . Then she threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Mister Spencer ! " The sealed elevator did n't move . The crowd inside shrank back against the walls , fearing they were trapped in the hands of a madwoman . " Will you please get this elevator moving ? " someone pleaded in a voice edgy with alarm . " It 's Mister Roy Spencer ! " the operator trumpeted again as she thrust her controls forward , plunging the elevator into an unscheduled six-story express descent . A woman screamed as the car shot past the main-floor landing on its way to the basement . The operator came out of her ecstatic trance in time to bring the elevator to a jolting stop just short of the bottom of the shaft . Then she turned her adoring eyes on Spencer . " Do n't you see ? It 's him ! " It was as if she were announcing the coming of the Messiah . A few older members of the group cast guarded looks and nodded in uncertain recognition . The younger ones looked puzzled , if not downright scared . Arnie sighed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with humility .  | " Will you please let us out of here ? " importuned a red-faced white-haired gentleman . The bemused operator raised the car haltingly to the main floor and opened the doors . Spencer waited in the middle of the car and allowed the other passengers to flow around him on their way out . Arnie , who had been among the first to leave , stood just outside the door , fidgeting . The elevator operator stood in her corner , hand to breast , caressing Spencer with worshipful eyes . The car started to fill with a new group of passengers , who cast curious sidelong glances at the gangly man who had not gotten out and who now placed a forefinger under the chin of the elevator operator and raised her face to his . The starter began clacking his castanets , impatiently signaling the car to depart . " Thank you , my dear , " said Spencer with real gratitude . " Oh ! Mr. Spencer ! " the woman gasped . " I used to be in love with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come drag me out of the movie house . " " Do you live here in the city , Miss ? " Spencer glanced up at the card above the operator 's control panel " ? Martin ? " Miss Martin 's face glowed beatifically . " Yes . " The starter poked his head into the car and growled , " Is there something wrong , Miss Martin ? " The operator snapped out of her trance , blinking . Arnie stepped into the car , took a firm hold on Spencer 's arm , and rasped through gritted teeth , " We have to leave now , Mr. Spencer . " Spencer shrugged . The elevator operator sighed . Arnie led his client away . The elevator door began to slide shut . Spencer halfturned in time to see the operator wiggle her plump fingers at him in a girlish gesture of goodbye . He aimed a wink at her that sent her hand flying to her breast again . Arnie was walking close to Spencer , one hand under Spencer 's elbow , threading him through the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you start flipping out every time some broad remembers your name ? " " A few years now , Arnie , " Spencer answered flatly . " Christ ! You know what happens to guys who go that route ? They wind up needing a keeper . " " I 'm all right , Arnie . It was just nice to be recognized like that . " He let Arnie hustle him through the store . Being piloted through the crowd that way , he could almost imagine it was like old times , with everyone calling out his name as the elevator operator had done , and plucking at his clothes for souvenirs . There had been a time when he had grown to resent the crowds , when he had hired bodyguards to fend them off and had delighted in stratagems that would help him to avoid them entirely . He had once considered it something of a triumph when he had managed to leave a crowd behind , screaming his name at the entrance of a hotel , while he escaped unnoticed through a back alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody noticed him , except a few , like the elevator operator . He felt a pang of remorse as it occurred to him that maybe that sweet elevator operator had been left standing outside some hotel entrance one day , long ago , without even so much as a look at his face . The blast of hot air as they went through the door into the street brought him back to the present . " She 's a middle-aged woman , Roy , " Arnie was saying . " She could have a husband at home . She could be a grandmother even . Spencer pulled his arm free . " What are you talking about , Arnie ? " " I mean , " said Arnie , " I 've seen it before with you guys . Just because some broad recognizes your face and says a kind word , you begin to think it 's like some kind of invitation . And you wind up in court . " " Aw , come on Arnie ! " There was a plaintive whine in Spencer 's voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid ? "  | " Well , she remembered me . And it made me feel good . What 's wrong with that ? " " You asked her where she lived . I heard you . " " I just thought I might send her some flowers and a note . A kind of thank you ' for remembering . " " You sure ? " " How long have you known me , Arnie ? " " O.K. , Roy , " Arnie said , feeling a little ashamed . " Forget it , " said Roy , knowing that Arnie had been just a little bit right . They walked over toward Park Avenue together and shook hands down in front of Arnie 's office building . Spencer did n't like to go up into the offices anymore . They regarded him as something of a leper up there and he knew it . EIGHT WEBSTER STOPPED for a frankfurter and an orange drink at a narrow stand wedged between a laundromat and a candy store on First Avenue near Eighty-fourth street . It was late in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shave ago , his room rank with the smell of developing fluid and fixative , the residue of his labors of the night before . He carried the results , eight-by-ten prints , in a manila envelope under his arm . A transistor radio hung by its carrying strap from a hook on the wall , filling the enclosure with the explosive jubilance of Shea Stadium as the Mets racked up a tie-breaking run in the bottom of the ninth . Webster gulped down the orange , hoping it would wash the taste of the night out of his mouth . " How about those Mets ? " the counterman intoned as he picked up Webster 's glass . " How about another drink ? " Webster cut him off . He did n't  | have time to stand around talking baseball with countermen . He was carrying forty enlargements in his manila envelope . Photos of travel itineraries . And Mahon was waiting for them . He still did n't know why Mahon had wanted him to photograph all those travel itineraries . But he must have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahon . Mahon had class , had grown rich working outside the law , and had never spent any time behind bars . Webster had n't done any time either , not since he had signed on with Mahon . Mahon was a good man to be with . He finished his frankfurter and the second glass of orange drink , paid for his breakfast , and stepped out into the rancid summer air . He walked the four sooty blocks to Mahon 's luxury building , took the elevator up , handed Mahon the envelope , and went to the refrigerator and poured himself a glass of freshsqueezed orange juice . He sipped the juice and watched the tugs and barges working the river while Mahon looked over the pictures . " Sharp work , Don , " Mahon muttered . " Real nice . " He sat at a teak table in the dining alcove and studied each photo with painstaking care . He separated the prints into piles  --  one for discard , one for further consideration . " My old man always told me , Learn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years in Sing Sing learning it . " " They taught you real good , Don . " " They call it rehabilitation . You find what you 're looking for ? " " Not yet . A couple of possibilities . But not really the one I want . " " Can I have some more orange juice ? " " You keep drinking that stuff , you 're going to wind up with a bad case of the runs . " Webster went to the refrigerator and poured himself another tall glass of juice . " You ever been to Europe , Don ? " Mahon asked as he continued inspecting the photos .  | " I only been to Canada . " " I just wonder what these people think they 're going to see . Half a day here . Half a day there . " Mahon dropped a photo onto the discard pile and picked up another one . " Hey ! " " You find something ? " Webster asked hopefully . " I think so , " Mahon said , reexamining the travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Spencer ? " Webster scratched around in his memory . " You mean the old movie star ? " " That 's right . " " Used to play in all them war movies ? Sure ! Roy Spencer . " Webster 's voice was warm with memories of bygone years . " Great actor . Flying them B-29s . Parachuting in behind the enemy lines . What ever happened to him ? " " He got old , I guess . " " He on one of them cards I photographed ? " Webster moved around the table so that he could look over Mahon 's shoulder . " Do you figure it 's the same Roy Spencer ? " " I do n't know , " said Mahon . " But he 's flying from New York to Paris on the morning of July seventeenth . First leg of a trip to Rome . He 's going to lay over in Paris for three days . That 's all that interests me . Get Lynch on the phone . I want to drive over to this Spencer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spencer 's travel itinerary . " He lives on Central Park South . He must have some bread . " " I suppose so , " said Mahon , folding the photo and slipping it into his pocket . " Then why would he want to do a job for you ? " Mahon stood up and stretched . " He 'll never know he 's doing a job for me . At least , I hope not . "  | NINE THE BUILDING was the only blemish in the flawless opulence of Central Park South . A low brownstone , with dusty windows and cornices soiled by pigeons , it huddled like a beggar midst whiteshouldered luxury towers . It occupied a parcel of land so small that it had somehow come unscathed through five decades of destruction as , wave after wave , the real estate developers had reconstructed the street . It was the last of a row of gracious and comfortable houses that had been erected just before the turn of the century . It had been designed to accommodate one family on each of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park from the parlor window . In recent years the large apartments had been cut in half , so that the building now comprised ten small dwelling units made up of bedroom , living room , bath and kitchenette . But only the units facing front still had a view of the park . The rear apartments looked out on the trash-can-filled courtyard between The Regency and Century House . Roy Spencer lived on the second floor , in the back . He came out of the elevator feeling good . He had three fine new suits from Saks in the boxes under his arm . And he had an airline ticket to Rome , with a three-day stopover in Paris , in his pocket . And in less than two weeks ' time he 'd be making movies again . He put the boxes down beside his door and reached into his trouser pocket for the key . And stopped cold . The lock on his door was gone . There was just a neat , round hole in the wood panel where it had been . Spencer 's stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up his packages . He was halfway down the stairs before he stopped and regained control of himself . How would it look  --  Roy Spencer running out into the street , hollering for a cop like some scared old woman ? Heart pounding , he moved cautiously back up the stairs to the  | door and listened . There was n't a sound from inside the apartment . Whoever had been there had probably left long ago . He turned the knob and flung the door open hard , so that it banged against the wall . Then he waited . If there was someone inside , he 'd be as frightened as Spencer and come tearing out . Spencer did n't want to surprise anybody . There was still no sound from inside . How different this was from all the scripts that had called for him to kick a door open and burst in on the enemy , gun blazing . He made much of clearing his throat and then called out nervously , " Anybody home ? " There was still no sound from inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and looked into the living room . It was just as he had left it . The hall-closet door was open a crack . He stood behind it and pulled it all the way open . No one rushed out . Nothing was disturbed inside . Then what the hell had happened to his lock ? Certainly the janitor would n't have removed it for some sort of routine maintenance without first telling him . He crossed through the kitchenette to the bedroom , and froze . The bedroom looked as if it had been hit by a bomb . The dressers had been disemboweled , their drawers torn out and scattered about the room . Socks , shirts , underclothes , everything dumped in heaps on the bed , on the floor , everywhere . And covering everything , like a blanket of polychromatic snow , thousands of ticket stubs , from movie theaters , playhouses , circuses , antique fairs , any place he had ever been that had required a ticket for entry . He had kept them , through the years , since he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept them . He had just started doing it one day . And forever after , whenever he had come home from a movie or a play , he had dropped the stub into a box . He had three large jewelry boxes full of them . He watched the stubs shift and flutter in the draft from the open window . And then he began to laugh . He sat down on the  | bed , midst the piles of socks and underwear covered over with ticket stubs , and laughed until his eyes began to fill with tears . Because whoever had broken into his apartment had picked the wrong man . He could just see the startled look on the burglar 's face as he emptied jewel box after jewel box and found himself wading in ticket stubs . He almost felt sorry for the poor son of a bitch who had somehow discovered an ex  --  movie star  --  no  --  a movie star lived here , and had come looking for treasure . Only Roy Spencer had no treasure . He just had three fancy boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He checked the bedroom closet . His two old suits were there , and his bathrobe . He guessed the market for old suits was pretty nil . His expensive piece of luggage , a big three-suiter purchased in better times , had been taken down off the closet shelf and was lying open on the floor . But , of course there had been nothing inside . He checked it over and found it to be undamaged . Fortunately , it had n't been locked . Wearily he reached across the bed to the telephone on the gutted dresser and dialed the operator . The phone rang interminably . Finally a woman 's voice answered . " Operator . May I help you ? " " Would you connect me with the police , please ? " " There is a special number for that purpose , sir ? " He could n't decide whether it was a woman or a recording . " ? please dial 911 . " " For Christ 's sake ! " Spencer slammed down the receiver . Then he dialed 911 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would send a man right over . Nobody appeared to know who he was , other than a citizen in distress . Must be young cops , he thought a little sadly . He dialed Arnie Grant 's number . Another professional operator 's voice came on . " Artists International . " She 'd learned how to say the name of the agency and a few other useful phrases in  | what passed for a British accent . But Spencer knew that her British was limited to the few words she had learned by rote , and that everything else came out South Bronx . " Mr. Grant 's office , please , " said Spencer . " Thank you , " said cheery Miss Mary Poppins . A few buzzes and clicks later Miss Wendt came on . She was Arnie 's secretary . " Mildred , this is Roy . Is Arnie there ? " " Will you hold , Mr. Spencer ? He 's on long distance . " " Sure , " said Spencer . Having to " hold " was an act of humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star . Finally Arnie came on . " Jesus , Roy ! I hope this is important . I 've just been on the pipe to the coast . Those people at Magno are trying to get away with murder on Jeannie Gordon 's billing . It 's like they 're pretending they never read the contract . You remember how tricky those bastards can be about billing . " " Yeah , " said Spencer . " I remember . " " Well , let 's go , babe . What is it ? " Spencer could see Arnie behind his desk , fidgeting , phone tucked up between his shoulder and his ear , breaking pencils , as he always did when he was impatient . He had every right to be impatient . He had clients waiting who brought him fifteen hundred dollars a week in commissions , not fifteen hundred a year , the way Spencer did these days . " I was robbed , " Spencer said flatly . " Oh , Christ ! " Arnie groaned . " They did n't mess you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robbed . I 'm O.K. " " I mean , you 've got to start shooting in less than two weeks ' time . " " I did n't even see them , Arnie . They broke into my apartment while I was out . " " Oh , Christ ! They did n't get your new clothes , did they ? " " They did n't get anything , that I can see . "  | " Well , thank God for that . You scare them off ? " " I told you . I did n't even see them . " " You call the police ? " " They 're on their way . " " Listen , Roy , " Arnie advised . " I want you to tell the cops they took your jewelry . Fifty thousand dollars ' worth . " " You know I do n't have any jewelry . " " I know . But maybe we got something here we can plant your name in the columns with . If they did n't take anything , we got no story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , Arnie . Filing a false claim like that , " Spencer protested . " O.K. , O.K. Forget that anything was stolen . You tell the cops you found this guy going through your stuff and you fought him off . Sent him running with his tail between his legs . That 's more like your old image anyway . You do that , Roy , and I think I can get a couple of lines in the columns , and maybe even a spot on the Frankie Collins show . Will you do that for me , Roy ? " " All right , Arnie . I 'll tell them I fought him off . " " You make it sound good , and you 'll see . It 's really going to help you . Especially with the picture coming on . " Spencer 's doorbell rang . " I 'll try , Arnie . There 's someone at the door . It must be the police . " " O.K. , kid , " said Arnie . " You do your bit , I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light weaponry . Racks of rifles lined the walls . Side arms of every weight and caliber nested in glass display cases . There were guns for every taste and every occasion : Elizabethan muskets and Civil War Sharps rifles for  | the collector ; custom-built shotguns for the wildfowl enthusiast ; elephant guns for the lovers of bigger game . Magnificent pieces , all of them , and all exceedingly expensive . Abercrombie 's was indeed a sportsman 's paradise . Mahon walked in awe through the gun shop to the customleather-goods department in back . " Help you , sir ? " inquired the clerk , a robust advertisement for outdoor living . " Yes , " said Mahon , reaching into his breast pocket . " I want to surprise a friend with some matching luggage . " The clerk nodded approvingly . " How many pieces did you have in mind ? " " Well , " said Mahon , " It 's not exactly that simple . You see , my friend already has one piece . What I want to do is have an exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded thoughtfully . " Well , it 's a little difficult , but there 's no reason why we ca n't do it . Can you arrange for us to look at the original piece ? " " I do n't think I can do that . It would kind of spoil the surprise . " The clerk 's face darkened . " But I have the dimensions . And I have photographs , with the case open and closed , exterior and interior . " " Color ? " asked the clerk , a little brighter . " Color , " Mahon answered , handing over the pictures that Webster had taken in Spencer 's apartment the afternoon before . The clerk examined the pictures . " Very good . These are very , very good . If you have the dimensions , I think we can do it . " " I would have to have the pieces in no more than a week 's time . " " Birthday ? " " That 's right . " " Well , it can be managed . But you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . "  | Mahon nodded . " It 's a very important friend . " " I just want to check this pattern . " The clerk crossed around behind his counter and picked up a magnifying glass . " Oh , that ! " said Mahon . " They 're initials . He has them stamped all over the face of the suitcase . CMCMCMCMCM . ' He 's a very egotistical guy . " Mahon smiled uneasily . The initials were the complicating factor in this job . It would have been a lot easier had Spencer , like most people , simply owned a piece of brand-name luggage . He could n't for the life of him imagine why Spencer had somebody else 's initials stamped all over the bag , unless it had once belonged to one of his wives . The clerk , who had been examining the photos with the magnifying glass , looked up , puzzled . " You say these are your friend 's initials ? " " That 's right , " said Mahon uneasily . " C.M. ' His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How fortunate for him . But I 'm afraid we ca n't do this work after all . " " Why not ? " Mahon asked , alarmed . " Well , you see , your friend 's initials may be CM , ' which may be why he purchased this particular piece in the first place . It would appear to be almost custom-made for him . But the pattern on the luggage is actually not CMCMCM , ' but MCMCMC ' . It all depends how you read it . If we were to duplicate this we would be acting in violation of a copyright . " " I do n't understand . " " Well , you see , " the clerk explained . " This luggage patterned with the MC ' initials is a Mark Cross exclusive . It would be most unethical for us to duplicate it . And at any rate , you do n't have to have it custom-made . You can buy it out of stock at the Mark Cross shop on Fifth Avenue . " Mahon swallowed hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glad we could be of help , " said the clerk , and handed the photos back to Mahon.  | ELEVEN DAYS AND nights of anguish and remorse had ravaged Nick Hollister . His skin had taken on the gray patina of the dead . His eyes had the look of the haunted . Silent screams echoed inside his skull . For two weeks now , since Emboa 's visit and the first phone call to his family in the States , Hollister 's house near Rapallo and its hillside grounds had become the scene of a self-imposed solitary confinement . It was as if by remaining there close to the phone , which was his only link with his wife and daughter , and his line of communication with Mahon in New York , he might , by some mystical power of voice and will , ensure his family 's safety and the success of Mahon 's mission . Before the first week of vigil had ended he had found Esmerelda 's watchfulness and concern unbearable , and he had sent her away . He had ordered the handyman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been alone , pacing the confines of his study , wreathed in a smoky blue haze , inhaling the same cigarette exhaust he had exhaled hours before . He had passed the time flipping , unseeing , through old magazines , allowing himself no more than one ounce of whiskey or gin every sixty minutes , lest his head not be clear should the moment come when clarity was required . Some days he put his clothes on . Some days he spent in the underwear he had slept in . He sustained himself on chunks of cheese and slices of salami , occasionally opening a can of prepared food and spooning up its contents cold . He spent his nights pacing the corridors of the house , running alternatives through his mind , and finding he had none , until his eyes would remain open no longer and his spine would no longer support his weight . Then he would collapse onto a chair or a couch or a bed and fall into a shallow sleep alive with dream images of ringing telephones which would snap him awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure whether the phone was ringing in his dream or in his study . This morning the phone had rung . It was Mahon in New York , telling him that if everything went according to plan he was to expect delivery at Orly Airport , outside Paris , on Friday , July 17 . TWA flight number 507 , direct from New York to Rome via Paris ; care of Mr. Roy Spencer . " Thank you , Otis , " said Hollister , his voice husky with emotion . " You 'll never know how much . " " How much is exactly fifty thousand , " Mahon had answered lightly . " And , " he added , " may your gratitude remain undiminished when it comes time to pay the bill . " Hollister had hung up the phone , lit another cigarette with trembling fingers , and inhaled deeply . His head felt like a balloon floating somewhere above his shoulders at the end of a thread . He picked up the phone again and dialed the operator . " I want to call Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind . " Forget that , operator . I want to place an overseas call first . " And then , as he had done every day for the past two weeks , he gave the number of his home in Michigan . Before he spoke to Emboa and told him the delivery date , he wanted to check again on the welfare of his family . He poured himself a drink and sipped it , the alcohol burning his raw throat , and smoked more cigarettes while he waited for the connection to be made . At last the call came through . The gut-rumbling voice of the unknown man at the other end of the line answered . " May I speak to my wife or my daughter ? " Hollister asked , although he knew the reply would be as it had been every day except the first for the past two weeks . " You 'll have to put on the Curator of Official Documents first . " " He 's not here . You know that . " " Then you speak to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hollister pleaded .  | " The conditions of my employment say I 'm not supposed to give messages . " I know . But this is different . Just so they 'll know it will be just another few days . Then everything will be all right . Everything is all set . Tell them that . " " I could n't tell them that , " the man answered . " It would be unkind . What if something went wrong at your end , and we had to kill them after all ? " There was a click at the other end as the man hung up . Hollister 's stomach contracted . The liquor came burning back up into his throat again . He stood , hands braced on his desk for support , elbows locked , until he regained control of himself . Then he placed his call to Emboa in Rome . TWELVE GEORGE SNELLING was one of a dozen itinerant venders of goodwill in the employ of the A.E.C. It was his job to travel about the world delivering and retrieving atomic materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politically empathetic developing countries of Asia and Africa . In the course of his travels he had ruined his stomach with too many exotic foods and become the prisoner of a mind incapable of protracted concentration . At first , when he had been given the job , his friends and family had thought he was on the way to becoming a very important person . But it had soon become apparent to him that he was nothing more than a nuclear messenger boy and that , in the high-powered intellectual atmosphere of atomic physics , that was all he would ever be . His family and friends still thought of him as a very important person . And over the years , thanks to their naivete , he  | grew in stature in their minds . He nurtured that deception , since it was really all he had . This evening , with his stomach laden and his mind numb after hours of engorging food and verbiage in the State Dining Room in Masabara , he stood with Dr. Zimmermann and Colonel Aboud behind an insulating screen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remote-controlled steel claws lifted the lethal pellets one by one and placed them gently , as if they were newly hatched eggs , into narrow lead cylinders which were , in turn , neatly laid down in a lead-lined box no larger than a diplomat 's attache case . Snelling fought down a belch he wished to God he could let go of and thought bitterly that a degree in physics from M.I.T. , even one without honors of any kind , should have opened the door to becoming something better than this : a human sponge , collecting nuclear loans while absorbing Lucullan dinners and unctuous speeches of gratitude . The last of the lead tubes was placed in the insulated attache case . The steel claw snapped the lid shut , lifted the case by its handle , and placed it inside a wooden box carpentered to a precise fit . An hour later , Snelling stood under the wing of an Air Force jet transport while Dr. Zimmermann squeezed his hand in parting and Colonel Aboud expressed his eternal gratitude and the gratitude of the emerging people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cinobar , most of whom had never seen an electric light , could be all that grateful for the loan of a few tubes of plutonium . But he accepted the farewell speech with the graciousness that the occasion called for , complimented Dr. Zimmermann on his pile , picked up his case of plutonium by its handle , and climbed up into the aircraft . The flight sergeant sealed the door shut . The pilot revved up his engines . As the plane began to roll down the runway , Snelling asked plaintively , " Does anyone on board have an Alka-Seltzer ? "  | THIRTEEN IT WAS still early afternoon New York time when Mahon called Webster and Lynch to his apartment for a final briefing . " The Air Force plane is due to arrive at eight-forty-five tomorrow morning . Spencer 's TWA flight goes at nine-fifty . " " That 's cutting it pretty fine , is n't it ? " Webster asked . " That 's the way I want it to be . You try to score with the bootleg play , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " " What happens if the government plane is late ? " " No reason why it should be . It left on schedule . It travels at a prescribed speed . It does n't get stacked up over the airport , not with what it 's carrying . It 'll come in on time . You both have all your equipment ? " Lynch and Webster nodded . " Then get a good night 's sleep . See you in the morning . " Lynch cursed as the clanging alarm jarred him awake . He , did n't bother to turn the bell off but let it ring until it had wound itself down . With one half-open eye he read the luminous dial . The hour hand pointed at 5 . The last time he had looked at the clock , after hours of tossing , it had been a little after 2 A.M. , and he had been sure he would never get to sleep at all that night . Yet he had n't wanted to risk taking a Seconal . Now , head buzzing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the three hours he had managed . It was dark in the room and dark outside the window as he swung his legs over the side of the bed , found the floor with his toes , and made his way to the narrow kitchen without turning on the lights . At this hour , with his energy at low ebb , he could n't bring himself to face the assault of incandescent light . Now , with night vision , making out shapes in the darkness , . '  | he took a bowl down out of the cupboard and filled it with dry cereal and milk . He let the cornflakes soak while he started heating water for his coffee . Unlike the happy people in the commercials , he liked his cornflakes soggy . Then he padded off to the bathroom . When he carne back , he ate the mushy cereal , poured boiling water over a couple of tablespoonfuls of instant coffee , stirred in some sugar , and set the scalding brew on the table to cool while he went into the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air of the sleepwalker was gone . He snapped on the bedroom light , peeled off the underwear he had been sleeping in , and put on fresh . He took an old , stained mechanic 's jump suit down off a shelf in the closet and set it out on the bed . It was voluminous in size , big enough for a man somewhat taller and considerably bulkier than he . He took a rubber vest from a bureau drawer , shook it out , and slipped into it . He attached the nozzle of a CO2 capsule to a valve in the vest and twisted the release until he heard the sound of hissing gas . The vest inflated to the size of a life jacket . He slipped a set of cheap , boy's-size football shoulder pads over his head and down around his shoulders . Then he climbed into the oversized jump suit , which fitted him quite snugly now except for the length of the legs . He sat down on the bed and , laboriously , like the fat man he had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifts built into the heels inside . He stood up , crossed to the mirror , and surveyed himself : a man twice as heavy as and a good deal taller than the one who had crawled out of bed twenty minutes earlier . He took his gray wig out of the hatbox in which it was stored and fitted it uncombed over his own thinning hair . He mussed it up with his fingers just for good measure . He had n't shaved in three days , and a heavy stubble of beard left his features undefined . He checked himself in the mirror again and , satisfied , took a  | wicker hamper out of the closet and neatly packed it with a gray guard 's uniform and cap . Then he went to the dresser and picked up his wallet , sunglasses , and some change . He removed his driver 's license from the wallet and replaced it with another one that he kept taped to the underside of a drawer . He picked up the hamper and moved ponderously through the apartment to the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to the hall , where he had propped an expensive fishing rod the night before . In the kitchen , he gulped down the strong , sweet lukewarm coffee . Then he picked up his fishing gear and left the apartment . Dawn was beginning to lighten the eastern sky as he reached the corner of his street , a burly fisherman waiting for a ride . Mahon pulled up a few moments later in a rented Plymouth . Lynch opened the trunk of the car and put his fishing equipment in on top of a Mark Cross suitcase exactly like the one they had photographed in Roy Spencer 's apartment . In a plastic bag behind the suitcase were the cap and neatly folded jacket of another gray guard 's uniform like the one he had packed into his hamper . Still another plastic bag enclosed an airport baggage handler 's cap . Lynch shut the trunk , crossed around , and climbed into the back seat of the car beside Webster . They drove in silence under a brightening sky in the cool stillness of early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge , over the nearly empty traffic arteries of Queens , and into the feeder roads at Kennedy Airport , finally coming to a stop outside the batwinged concrete canopy of the TWA building . Mahon got out of the car and opened the trunk . He was already wearing a baggage handler 's trousers and shirt , and a plastic bow tie . He took the porter 's cap out of the trunk and put it on his head . Then he took out the Mark Cross suitcase and shut the trunk . Webster got out of the back seat and moved up front  | behind the wheel . He watched Mahon , in his baggage handler 's outfit , carry the suitcase into the building . Then he released the hand brake . The Plymouth cruised off . Webster drove slowly through the maze of airport roadways until he found his exit , a left turn under a cloverleaf leading to the Shore Parkway . He took the parkway , skirting Jamaica Bay , that big , foul-smelling body of water on the edge of which the airport had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes and then took the exit marked HOWARD BEACH . He stopped the car on a weed-grown street near a rotting fishing wharf about a quarter of a mile from the Howard Beach bungalow community . He got out of the car , opened the trunk , and picked up his gray guard 's jacket and cap . He was already wearing the gray trousers . Carrying the jacket and cap under his arm , he crossed the pocked and broken roadway to the fishing wharf . Lynch got into the front of the car , wedged his bulk in behind the steering wheel , and drove off slowly down the street . A two-minute drive brought Lynch to a narrow channel crossed by a wooden bridge posted with the warning LIMIT 5000 LBS . No TRUCKS . He drove the car over to the curb and parked . He got his equipment out of the trunk and waddled up the street and around the corner where , a half block down , he could see the sign STAN 'S FISHING STATION . BOAT RENTALS AND BAIT . He was pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's small , weedy parking lot . Lynch walked through the parking area toward a shanty with Saran Wrap windows . A hand-lettered sign above the doorway read STAN 'S SEASIDE BAR AND GRILL . HOT FRANKS  --  COLD BEVERAGEs . The doorway was not obstructed by a door . Lynch walked in . The place smelled of stale beer and hamburger grease . A seamy-faced boozehound in a soiled white yachting cap shuffled about behind the counter , frying eggs on a grill situated next to the cash register . The old boozehound surveyed Lynch with watery eyes .  | " You want a boat , I hope you got a reservation , " the old man snapped . " Are you Stan ? " " Well , I hope you do n't think I 'm the short-order cook . " " O.K. , Cap , " said Lynch . " I spoke to you yesterday . You reserved me an outboard . " The old man slipped a spatula under his eggs and plopped them onto a plate . " Good thing you called in advance . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out already . What you say your name was ? " " Chandler , " said Lynch . Holding the plate with the eggs on it in one hand , the old man turned and ran a grime-ringed fingernail down a list taped to the wall behind the cash register . He found " Chandler 's " name there , nodded , and turned back . " O.K. , friend . You got a boat . Want some breakfast before you start ? Special on eggs , toast , and coffee . Just six bits . " He held up his plate of eggs for Lynch 's approval . " No , thanks , " said Lynch , eyeing the greasy fried eggs . " I want to get an early start . " " Suit yourself , " said the old man . He put the plate down on the counter , picked up a fork out of a tray , wiped it on his sleeve , and began to eat the eggs . " Boat 's down there on the water . Just have to hook on the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the other , he reached under the counter and came up with a mimeographed piece of paper . " I really want to get started , " Lynch said , checking his watch . " You got to fill out these forms anyways . So there 's no sense letting my eggs get cold . " The old man shoved the mimeographed paper and a pencil over to Lynch . " It 'll be twenty dollars for the day , in advance . You got identification ? " " Driver 's license , " said Lynch , taking out his wallet . " That 'll do it . " Lynch began filling in the form with a name , address , phone  | number , and employer as fictitious as those on his driver 's license . Stan wiped up the last of his egg with a piece of bread . " Do n't mind if I have a cup of coffee , do you ? " " You bet I do , " said Lynch with iron in his voice . " I want to get going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't , " Stan grumbled . " You got it in your heads if you ai n't out there first , the other guy is going to run off with all the fish . " He took the mimeographed sheet of paper , Lynch 's driver 's license , and the two ten-dollar bills and dropped them all into a cigar box . " I keep the license till you get back . O.K. ? " " O.K. , " said Lynch . The old man came around from behind the counter , still complaining . " Sent my first boat out this morning before the sun even come up . Been up a hour and a half and ai n't even had my cup of coffee yet . " He led Lynch out of the shanty and down the short , weedy slope to the dock . " Know what I 'm going to do someday ? Going to retire to Florida . These early hours are killing me . " He stopped in front of a wooden shed at the foot of the dock , fished around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Got to keep a bicycle lock on this place or it 'll be picked clean in no time at all . Ca n't turn your back no more without having something lifted . " Groaning , Stan hoisted a five-horsepower Evinrude off a rack in the locker and , griping all the way , led Lynch out onto the dock . He climbed down into a fourteen-foot skiff , dragged the Evinrude down into the boat after him , and hooked it onto the transom . Then , breathing hard , he climbed back onto the dock . Lynch dropped his fishing gear down into the boat . " Do I have enough gas so I do n't get stranded out in the middle of the bay somewheres ? " " Mr. Chandler , " wheezed the old man , " right now you ai n't got  | enough gas to get away from the dock . " Cackling , he turned and made his way back to the shed . Lynch began to sweat , and it was n't because of his padding and bulky clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he was being stymied by a crazy old man who should be put away , not retired to Florida . He felt like following the old man back up the hill and breaking his neck . But that would n't get him away from the dock either . There were a couple of other boat stations in Howard Beach . He 'd get a boat somewhere . He jumped down into the skiff and picked up his gear . He threw the rod and wicker hamper up onto the dock and then , struggling in his inflated suit , tried to climb back up himself . He was still half in the boat , half on the dock when he saw Stan coming back , bent over under the weight of a five-gallon gas tank . " Seasick already ? " Stan called out with glee . Lynch dropped back into the boat . " Just coming up to see if you had an empty coffee can , " he said by way of explanation . " How could I ? " grunted Stan , setting down the gas tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me a hand with this . " Lynch helped him haul the gas tank down into the boat . " What you want with a coffee can anyway ? " " Bail out some of the water in the bottom , " Lynch offered lamely . Stan hooked the hose from the gas tank to the motor . " Hell , this ai n't no cabin cruiser . That little bitty water ai n't going to hurt nothing . There , now ! You got enough gas to last the day . Just do n't get no ideas about going out deep-sea fishing . You catch a marlin , it like to tow this boat all the way to Montauk . " He stood there a moment chuckling over the improbable picture he had conjured up : a big-game fish towing the little skiff out to sea . Then he shook his head and climbed out of the boat . He picked up a weathered oar from the dock and passed it down to Lynch . " That 's just in case . " He took a shabby life  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . Then he passed Lynch his fishing gear . " Good hunting . " Stan dismissed Lynch with a wave and started back up the dock . Lynch bent over and pulled hard on the starter cord . The engine caught and died . He jerked the starter cord again , with the same result . He glanced at his watch . It was 7:30 . " Stan ! " Lynch yelled . The old man stopped at the far end of the dock , shook his head in disgust , and ambled back to the boat . He peered down at Lynch as at a worm . " The motor wo n't start , " said Lynch plaintively . Sweat was beginning to bead on his upper lip . " Give her another yank , " Stan commanded . Lynch pulled the lanyard . The motor wheezed and then became still . Stan shook his head . " You did n't choke her . " " You did n't tell me to . " " Man rents a boat from me , I figure he knows how to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the choke . Now give her another yank . " Lynch did as he was told . The motor caught and roared . " Your throttle is on your tiller . It 's the handgrip , like on a motorcycle , " Stan shouted above the racket . Lynch twisted the throttle and the motor roared louder . He twisted it the other way and it quieted . Lynch smiled . " I got it now . " " Not yet you ai n't , " Stan crowed . " Know why you ai n't pulling away from the dock ? " Lynch looked up , puzzled . " The rope 's still tied on ? " Stan shook his head again . " You 're in neutral . See that handle down there ? When I cast off the line you push that handle down . Then your gear 's engaged and she moves forward . " " Do I push it up for reverse ? "  | " I told you this ai n't no cabin cruiser . Want to swamp her ? Boat that size you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lynch , chastened . " Let 's go . " " Sure you got it straight now ? " Stan teased . " I got it straight , " Lynch snapped . " I hope so , " said the old man . He bent down and threw off the rope . " Just stay clear of the shallow water , " he called as Lynch eased the boat away from the dock . Then he turned and started toward his shanty  --  where , to his dismay , two more men bearing fishing gear were waiting to rent another of his boats . FOURTEEN LYNCH GUIDED the boat at low throttle up the Howard Beach channel and under the wooden bridge he had driven across twenty minutes earlier . It did n't take him long to get the feel of the tiller and of movement over water . Out in the bay he gradually added power until , with a surging feeling of release , he was bouncing along , bow high , across the widening expanse of water . He circled wide around the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a quarter mile down the shoreline of the bay , where Webster would be waiting . Soon he could make out Webster 's figure , sitting lazily at the edge of the wharf , legs dangling . Looking around , he noted , to his satisfaction , that the bay , even this early in the morning , was already speckled with at least a dozen small boats similar to his . He checked his watch again . It was 7:50 . He was a little behind schedule , but not much , and he was moving across the water at a healthy clip . The wharf and the figure on it were growing perceptibly larger . Five minutes later he cut his motor and let the boat drift alongside the wharf where Webster was waiting . Lynch hung onto a  | piling while Webster dropped into the boat , still carrying his guard 's jacket and cap under his arm . " What took you so long ? We 're running behind . " " The guy who rents these things is a clown and a slob , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lanyard and the motor coughed and died . Then he remembered about the choke and got the boat started , heading away from the wharf and out toward the middle of the bay . Ten minutes later , Lynch swung the tiller and aimed the boat , at a right angle , under the railroad causeway that crossed Jamaica Bay connecting the mainland of Queens with Long Beach . The shoreline of Kennedy Airport lay in front of his bow about a ten-minute ride away . A four-engined Boeing behemoth came screaming in over their heads , so low it seemed about to sit down on top of them . The men winced in pain and held their ears as the jet streaked past , heading in for a landing . At last , their ears ringing from the high-decibel assault of at least half a dozen homing aircraft , Lynch and Webster grounded the skiff on the kerosene-smelling strip of sand that ran around the perimeter of the airport . Lynch , in his jump suit , waded out and pulled the boat well up onto the sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cap and Lynch 's wicker hamper . They carried their things to the shelter of a clump of waisthigh beach grass and readied themselves for the next step in Mahon 's plan . Webster , who had only to don a jacket and cap , fidgeted while Lynch shed his jump suit , shoulder pads , inflated vest and built-up boots . Then Lynch dressed himself in the gray guard 's uniform like Webster 's , packed what he could of his outsized clothes into the now-empty wicker hamper , and carried it , along with the shoes , vest , and shoulder pads , back to the boat , where he stowed the clothing and the hamper under a thwart . Then he and Webster set out together on the long trek to the airport arrivals area . It was 8:25 A.M.  | FIFTEEN AT 8:30 , Roy Spencer 's alarm went off . But Spencer did n't hear it . He was in the shower , letting jets of cool water clean and tone his lanky body , washing the sleep and summer night 's sweat away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , a kind of memento of the way things used to be done . " Rise and shine , baby , " Arnie had crowed through sleepthickened vocal cords . " Got ta catch a plane today , kid . " " Thanks , Arnie , " Spencer had answered groggily . And then he had asked hopefully , " You going to be able to take me out to the flight ? " In those long-gone golden days there had always been somebody to shepherd him and smooth the way . " Sorry , baby , " Arnie had answered . " You know I 'd love to front for you . But I got a million things to do this morning . You know how it is . " Spencer knew , and understood . There had been a time when his trip to the airport would have been first on that list of a million things to do . But there were limits even to Arnie 's devotion . And an 8-o'clock call was the limit . Personal managers and press agents were the legitimate shepherd dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either one . " Thanks for the call , Arnie , " Spencer said with real sincerity . " Go over there and kill ' em , baby . This could be just the start of a lot of great new things . " " Thanks again , Arnie . " " My pleasure , " said Arnie . And clicked off . Spencer let the cool water run through his hair . Then he turned off the faucets and stepped out of the tub . He rubbed himself dry with a towel , shaved , combed his hair , carried his razor out into the bedroom , and tossed it into his open suitcase , packed the night before with everything but last-minute items . He went back into the bathroom , picked up his toothbrush and toothpaste , rolled them up in toilet paper , returned to the bedroom ,  | and tossed them in with the razor . Then he shut the suitcase and got dressed . Five minutes later he was in a cab , seated behind a driver who had just grown sullen upon getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fare all the way out to the airport , thereby missing the lucrative early-morning rush-hour short hauls . SIXTEEN " THERE SHE is , " Lynch exclaimed , as he and Webster came around the side of the freight-reception building and strolled with official elan toward the aircraft-unloading area . The big military transport , glistening with dew , gave the impression of sweating from the labor of its protracted flight as it waddled up the taxiway in the early-morning light toward the freight-reception area . Three forklifts waited , backed up against the wall , engines idling , so that the moment the aircraft rolled to a stop they could start unloading the bulky contents of her hold . The driver of the A.E.C. armored truck parked across the reception area from the forklifts nudged his dozing partner and pointed in the direction of the transport , which was pivoting on its nose wheel into a parking position . The forklifts were already jockeying for a place under the hugh aircraft 's belly . The driver of the armored truck started his engine and swung his vehicle around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ramp that was being rolled into position under the transport 's side door thirty yards away . The parcel they were here to receive would be coming down the ramp , in the hands of the A.E.C. overseas representative , Snelling . The driver kept his motor idling and watched through the side mirror as his partner got out  | and walked to the aircraft , where he took up his position at the foot of the ramp . " Who you waiting for , buddy ? " It was Webster , in his uniform , looking in through the open window on the vacated side of the armored cab . The driver looked across at him and smiled with the easy camaraderie that one uniform feels for another . " Some little shipment from overseas . Do n't know what they need the truck for . The courier could carry it on the subway . " He felt the door click open under his left elbow and thought for an instant that his partner had come back . He started to turn , annoyed that his partner should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he felt Lynch 's revolver pressing in hard under his ribs . He looked down and saw it was silencer-equipped . " Just take your side arm out carefully and lay it on the seat , " Lynch said in a reassuring undertone . The driver threw an imploring look at Webster on the other side  --  a fleeting , futile hope for help from that quarter . Webster winked at the driver reassuringly , opened the door , and quickly moved into the vacant seat . Webster had a silencer-equipped revolver in his hand too . " Just do like he says . O.K. ? " The driver half-sighed , half-moaned , and laid his side arm down carefully on the seat between himself and Webster . Webster picked up the weapon , made sure the safety was on , and slipped it into his belt . " Now , just move a little bit towards me and give my friend some room . " The driver moved over and Lynch got into the cab , sandwiching the driver between Webster and himself . " You a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll try not to hurt you , " Webster said . The guard nodded again . Through the truck 's side mirror , Lynch could see the airplane  | behind them with the passenger door open , and the driver 's armed partner going up the ramp , hand on holstered pistol butt in the prescribed fashion . The A.E.C. courier started down the ladder and was met by the guard halfway . The courier handed a wooden box to the armed guard by its metal handle . The two men started down the ramp together . There was a ripping sound as Webster tore a length of twoinch-wide adhesive tape off a roll . The driver looked at him fearfully as Webster pressed the tape down across his lips . " Just to protect you against your better instincts , in case you get the urge to yell , " Webster explained comfortingly . Through the side mirror , Lynch could see the guard and the A.E.C. courier approaching the rear of the armored truck . They appeared to be chatting amiably . Lynch nodded to Webster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's temple . " Now be very still . We want everyone to come out of this in one piece . " There was a sound of heavy metal scraping as the steel door in back of the truck was unlocked and pulled open . Lynch pressed the clutch pedal down to the floor , and held it there while he carefully shifted the stick into low gear . He kept the clutch pedal depressed . Sweat broke out on the driver 's forehead as he anxiously flicked his eyes back and forth between Webster and Lynch . There was a sound of wood skidding across metal as the guard slid the box of plutonium into the back of the truck . Then there was silence . Lynch 's eyes were riveted to the rearview mirror . His ears strained for the next sound , which would be his signal to move . " Can you see what they 're doing back there ? " Webster rasped . He was sweating now as hard as the terrified driver . " Shut up ! " Lynch snapped . His calf muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the clutch . All he could see through his mirror was part of the open rear door . Then the  | A.E.C. courier stepped backward and into view . The guard 's hand could be seen reaching around and taking hold of the door handle . The hand shoved the door . It started to swing shut , out of Lynch 's field of view . Eyes shut , teeth clenched , ears straining , Lynch waited for the sound of the heavy steel door crashing shut . That sound would come just a bare instant before the sound he must not let come : the sound of a key turning in a lock as the guard sealed the back of the truck . " Go ! " Webster shouted , as the steel door slammed shut . Lynch came down hard on the gas pedal and let the clutch come up . His cramped leg betrayed him . The clutch came guard , standing bewildered behind the truck , shouted the driver 's name : " Charlie ! " Then he came running around the side of the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter . The engine came alive again . By now the guard was abreast of the cab , and he could see that there were three men inside . The guard had his revolver out as Lynch shifted back into first . " Down ! " Lynch yelled , and hunched low over the wheel as the truck started to roll and the guard 's first two shots angled in through the open window and smashed up and out through the roof of the cab . Lynch wheeled the truck around so that the heavily armored rear end was facing the guard ; then he gunned the motor and began racing across the freight-reception area . Through his side mirror he could see the guard lining up a shot at the tires . He veered left under the tail of the military transport and headed for the jutting corner of one of the airline buildings . If they could make it behind the building , they would be free and clear . Now Lynch was running with his vulnerable side to the guard , and he could see the guard readjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab . A man in civilian clothes , the A.E.C.  | courier , was loping ineffectually across the area , waving his arms at the runaway truck . Lynch crouched low over the wheel again as the guard 's pistol jumped . The A.E.C. man appeared to trip and somersault as the .38 magnum slug caught him in the side . The guard froze , let his gun hand drop , and then ran to the sprawling courier as Lynch skidded the truck around the corner of the building and headed toward a far row of structures that jutted like peninsulas into the vast open space of the airport . When he had passed the second of the series of arrivals buildings , he slowed the truck and yelled to Webster , " O.K. Let 's dump him . " Webster opened his door and reached for the gagged driver , who gratefully scrambled across his captor 's knees and flung himself out of the cab . Webster watched as the man rolled , stopped , picked himself up , and began running for the nearest building , three hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass into the back , " Lynch shouted as he gunned the engine again . " We 're almost there . " Webster opened the panel that let into the back of the truck and crawled through . As Lynch sped toward the jutting corner of the last of the arrivals buildings , Webster fought his way across the bouncing bed of the rear of the truck , dragging the wooden box by its iron handle . " Almost there , " Lynch yelled . He could see Mahon in his porter 's cap , wheeling a dolly cart near the far end of the last building . Webster opened the rear door just a crack and held on for dear life . " Everything looks clear back here , " he shouted . They had moved fast . With four long buildings and more than a mile of distance between them and their starting point , neither the guard nor the driver of the truck had had time yet to turn in an alarm .  | " On the count of three , " Lynch yelled from up front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , was pushing his dolly cart nonchalantly along , not even bothering to turn and take notice of the truck speeding toward him . " One ? " Lynch yelled . Webster pulled the box up a few inches more so that it was sitting just on the edge of the doorway . " Two ? " Webster tensed , one hand on the door handle , the other on the box . The truck was almost abreast of Mahon now . Mahon looked up with mild interest . " Go ! " Lynch shouted , as he downshifted and engine-braked the truck . Webster swung the door open wide and shoved the box out over the rear bumper . The wood casing cracked as it hit the concrete a few yards in front of Mahon . Webster almost followed the box out as the truck accelerated again , throwing him off balance . After he regained his footing , and before he shut the rear door , he saw Mahon , in the receding distance , casually approach the box , place it inside a suitcase on his dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of airport security was on the phone , sealing off , one by one , all entrances and exits to the huge terminus . When he finished issuing instructions to his own people , he picked up the line to the freight-receiving building , where the armored-truck guard who had turned in the first alarm was waiting . " We 're closing down every entrance and exit on the grounds . Then we 'll start a sweep in from the perimeter . There 's no way they can get out . We 've got an ambulance on the way for that A.L.C. guy . What did you say his name was ? " " Snelling. "  | " Tell him it 'll only be a matter of minutes . How 's he doing ? " " I think he 's dead , " the guard answered gloomily . " Tough break . I 'm going up in the tower now to see if I can spot anything from there . I want you to come up too . Might be helpful . " The security chief , followed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator impatiently jabbing at the UP button , as if that would bring the automated tower lift any faster . Lynch slowed the armored truck as they reached the strip of sand near where they had beached their boat . Webster was out of the cab and running for the boat before Lynch had pulled to a stop . Lynch shifted into reverse and hacked the truck around so that its rear end faced the water . Then he shifted into neutral , pulled up the hand brake , and tore a long strip of tape off the roll Webster had used to gag the driver . Working swiftly , he taped the accelerator to the floor . Then he shifted into reverse again , released the hand brake , and jumped . The truck roared backward across the narrow strip of sand . The drag of the water , when it hit , slowed the truck 's rearward movement , but the engine , still dry , kept the wheels rolling until the truck was more than half submerged , with only the top of the cab and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pistons hissed to a steaming stop . By the time the security chief , checking on the efficacy of his roadblocks , turned his binoculars from the airport 's exits to the field itself , Lynch and Webster had succeeded in maneuvering their little skiff under the railroad causeway and were on their way to the far side of the bay . Webster handled the tiller while Lynch struggled into his fat man 's padding and jump suit . They sank their guards ' uniforms and weapons in the deep water near the causeway and headed their boat toward the section of bay near Howard Beach , which  | was already cluttered with at least two dozen boats as small and as undistinguished in appearance as their own . SEVENTEEN RIVERS OF baggage flowed unattended through the cinder-blockenclosed gloom of the routing room at ground level in the departure building . What light there was slanted through the narrow openings high in the wall which had been designed not so much to illuminate as to vent off heat generated by the machinery . No light was really necessary because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Conveyer belts moved the baggage ; automated claws and dumping devices lifted and pushed the parcels down chutes that let out onto loading platforms outside the building near where the aircraft for which each piece of luggage was intended would receive its load . There , forklifts , or porters with dolly carts like the one Mahon had been wheeling when he entered the room by a service door , would pick up the bags and load them into the belly of the airplane . Here , in the heat and hum of machinery and the hiss and sigh of pneumatic dumping devices , Mahon waited , and watched the moving suitcases until he felt his eyes would cross . Sweat trickled down his back between his shoulder blades . He could feel a prickly-heat rash beginning to erupt on his neck along the collar line . He flicked his eyes from the conveyer belt to his wristwatch . There was just thirty minutes left to flight time . With each minute that passed he felt himself losing a battle with despair . He had come too late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must already have arrived and sent his luggage through . The flow of suitcases for TWA flight number 507 began to grow sporadic . Mahon knew he had to make a decision and make  | it fast . He could leave the box of stolen goods here , for he would never get out of the airport with it now , and blow the contract . Or he could grab the next suitcase that came along on the belt , jimmy it open , replace its contents with the contraband , and alert Hollister in Italy to the change . The decision he finally made might have been different had he known of the colossal traffic jam that had developed on the roads outside as a consequence of the robbery and of the security officer 's order to stop and inspect every vehicle leaving the airport . In a taxi at the opposite end of the half-mile oval that led to the departure building , Roy Spencer sat slouched behind his cursing cabby , chewing on a piece of spearmint gum that had grown as tough and tasteless as plastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cab had n't moved more than a yard a minute for the past quarter hour . Spencer looked at his watch and at the distance remaining to the departure building . He chucked his stale piece of gum out the window and reached into his pocket . The meter read seven dollars and sixty cents . He tapped the driver on the shoulder and handed him a ten-dollar bill . Then he opened the door and shoved his bag out onto the roadway . " Hey ! " the driver whined . " Where you think you 're going ? " It was as if Spencer had become the driver 's personal property . " Sorry , buddy . Got to catch a plane . " The driver slid across his seat , clutching the ten-dollar bill in his fist , and stuck his face , red with fury , out the window . " And leave me here ? " the driver bellowed . " Without a fare ? I could be stuck here all day ! " " That 's just why I 've got to hoof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . Sorry . " Spencer picked up his bag and started walking toward the departure building . The driver leaped out of the cab and stood in the roadway  | shaking his fist with the ten-dollar bill in it . " You gon na strand me here ? " the driver screamed . Spencer sighed and kept walking , trying to shut out the sound of the driver 's strident protest . The day was hot and he had a long way to go . He was constitutionally unequipped to deal with unpleasantness . Behind him , the driver waited until Spencer was far enough away so that it would be unlikely he would return and demand his change . Then he complained loudly to anyone in the waiting cars who would listen : " Did you see what that son of a bitch just did to me ? Did you see it ? Goddamned has-been movie actors think they can get away with anything . " Well , thought Spencer , as he trudged on around the oval , at least he recognized me . In the torrid confines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penknife on the ten-cent lock of a cheap piece of coral luggage . He fervently wished that Lynch were here now . Lynch could have sprung the lock with a nasty look . And here he , Mahon , was fighting a losing battle with a piece of hardware on a suitcase he could have torn wide open with his fingernails . How simple it all would have been if only he had n't missed Spencer . All he would have had to do was lift Spencer 's Mark Cross bag off the conveyer and replace it with the duplicate on the dolly cart , already packed with the hijacked goods . The toylike lock snapped open at last , and Mahon opened the suitcase . It was full of woman 's things : panties , brassieres , sandals , stockings , Tampax , light sweaters , a blouse . He dragged them all out , like entrails from an open carcass . Then he opened his Mark Cross suitcase and lifted out the cracked wooden box that enclosed the lead-lined attache case . The broken wooden slats interfered with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ripped off the offending slats  | and shoved them into the Mark Cross bag . Now the attache case fitted , taking up the entire width of the suitcase , but not the length or depth . He rolled up the pajamas and stuffed them in on one side . He stuffed a sweater in on the other side , and threw the blouse and a bra in on top . Then he closed the lid and snapped the lock shut . He checked the cardboard tag tied to the suitcase handle , took a ball-point out of his shirt pocket , and wrote the woman 's name , flight number , destination , and baggage number down on a card in his wallet : BERNADETTE FINLETTER  --  NEW YORK  --  ROMEFLIGHT #507 . He picked up Miss  --  or was it Mrs. ? ? Finletter 's bag and placed it back on the conveyor belt . He watched as the pneumatic tilting device upended it and sent it sliding down the chute to the field-level loading dock outside the building . He stuffed the remainder of the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag , and put it back on the dolly cart . Then he rolled the cart out of the room , carefully closing the door behind him . He would have to hurry now , back to Manhattan , and get the word to Hollister about the change in plans . Inside the hot , humming machine-manned baggage room the conveyor belts continued their endless journey , carrying a few late items tagged for flight number 507 , including a Mark Cross suitcase belonging to Roy Spencer . EIGHTEEN HIGH HP in the control tower , the security chief handed his heavy binoculars to the armored-truck guard and pointed off in the direction of the bay on the western perimeter of the airfield . " Look out there , " the security chief instructed , " in the water just off the beach behind that crop of tall grass . Tell me if that 's your truck . "  | The guard took the glasses and panned slowly across the distant strip of beach . Suddenly he stopped and , leaning forward as if a few extra inches would bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored truck into focus . " That 's it , " the guard shouted . " That 's it ! " The security chief nodded , hung up the phone over which he had already finished issuing orders , and started moving toward the door . He motioned for the guard to follow . " Maybe the bastards are still in there , " the guard exclaimed hopefully as they left the tower . " Maybe they drowned . " " It would sure make things a lot easier for us , " the chief replied . Before he left the terminal buildings , Mahon paid a dime and went out on to the observation platform . There he put a coin in the slot that permitted sixty seconds ' use of the high-powered glasses mounted on the railing . He swept the beach area with the glasses until he found the submerged armored truck . Then he panned right and left and picked up the speeding patrol cars converging on the area . He swung the glasses again and brought them to bear on the bay , panning back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats on this side of the railroad causeway , and Lynch and Webster were n't in any of them . The causeway itself blocked his view of the other side of the bay . Mahon smiled , satisfied , and moved the glasses back to the submerged truck . The first patrol car had just arrived on the beach , and a uniformed man leaped out . The shutter snapped closed across Mahon 's lenses . He could have another look for another dime . But he had a transatlantic call to make , and he already knew what would happen on the beach . At least , he hoped it would happen that way . After timeconsuming investigation , the security police would find the  | armored truck empty . They would also find the rutted sand where a boat had been hauled up . They would surmise , correctly , that the thieves had made their getaway in a small boat . They would assume , incorrectly , that the thieves had taken the stolen goods with them . Coast Guard or police helicopters would be called in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably of the marinas along the shore . Through all this they would be looking for two men of a certain description , and the contraband . But by this time there would be only one man in the getaway boat , a heavyset man who bore no physical resemblance to the descriptions of either of the thieves , and he would not appear to be a man in flight . Mahon 's whole plan had been based on deception and speed . For if the investigators could be led to a first false assumption that the thieves had left the airfield with the stolen property , there would be time for an innocent traveler , making an overseas flight of just a few hours ' duration , to enter the European continent without detection . Perhaps by the next day investigators might conclude that the contraband had left the airport by some other means . But by then it would n't matter . Hollister would have received his package , and Mahon would have earned his fiftythousand-dollar fee . Mahon checked the Mark Cross suitcase in a coin-operated locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the terminal building , and got into the first cab in the taxi line outside . He gave the driver his destination and then leaned back , lit a cigarette , and treated himself to a few moments of relaxed self-congratulatory rumination . It was several minutes before he looked up and realized that the cab had barely moved at all . " What seems to be the trouble ? " he asked anxiously . " Traffic jam . " The driver shrugged . " Some kind of robbery . I been stuck in the damn circle for God knows how long . Took a guy all the way out here from Manhattan , and he walks out back there and leaves me sitting without a fare . Takes the bread right  | out of my mouth . You know who the guy was ? That old movie actor . Roy Spencer . You remember him ? Some cheap bastard . " Mahon sat back and closed his eyes . He was suddenly very tired . Out in the bay , Lynch guided his rented skiff toward the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his motor and held onto a piling while Webster climbed out . " Do n't bother to come back for me in the car , " Webster called . " I 'll take the bus and subway home . I do n't want to hang around here all day . " Lynch nodded , pushed off from the wharf , and steered his little boat out into the bay . When he got into an area where three or four other small boats were fishing , he cut his motor . Then he tied bait and a sinker onto the end of his line and dropped it over the side . The sun-sequined waters darkened for a moment as a shadow passed over him . The other fishermen in the area looked up with pained expressions at the police helicopter that was beating up the surface of the water around them . The helicopter hovered a moment and then , chugging and whining , moved on across the bay to inspect a boat heading into the Howard Beach channel . Lynch wedged his fishing rod under a thwart and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stashed away in the bottom . NINETEEN EVERY TIME he got into one of these things , Spencer felt as if he were settling himself into a coffin : an overcrowded , overupholstered container for bodies from which , once they were sealed inside , there was no escape . The enclosed boarding pods they used  | these days did n't help matters , either . He would much rather walk across the open field like a man , through wind or foul weather or anything else the airlines were trying to shield their passengers against , than be funneled like a vegetable into the maw of the aircraft . He suspected that what the airlines were really shielding their customers from was the urge to run the other way and ' avoid getting into the plane at all . In this apprehensive mood , Spencer threaded his way down the aisle and found a seat vacant , thank God , near a window . The SEAT BELTS sign flashed on , the engines whined into wakefulness , and the big Boeing jet pivoted on its nose wheel and lumbered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the undulating wing as the pilot rolled his heavy craft across the field toward the takeoff line . Spencer watched the springy wing and fought to control his apprehension . He tried to persuade himself that the wing was supposed to spring that way . It would not fall off in midair . In fact , once the plane was airborne , it would settle down and behave . He knew all this . He had learned it through hours of agonized personal observation . He had become an expert on the characteristics and behavior of wings . Prior to beginning his own observations , he had been assured of the structural integrity of commercial aircraft not by an aeronautics engineer , or anyone else so lacking in objectivity , but by his own psychiatrist : the one he had gone to years before when they had begun making Hollywood movies overseas , and after he had ceased to be a star of such magnitude that a producer would be willing to wait for his arrival by ship or train . He had learned to fly , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flying he had ever really enjoyed was in the B-17 bombers and Mustang fighter planes he had piloted as the hero of a score of World War II movies : plywood mock-ups that had never left the floor of the MGM sound stages . The captain swung his airplane around ninety degrees and  | brought it up to the takeoff line . The big jet shuddered from nose to tail as the pilot stood on his brakes and revved his engines up to an ear-shattering yowl , waiting for the " go " signal from the tower . Spencer 's mind raced in panicked synchronization with the airplane 's engines . Now , while the jet stood tensed , like a sprinter toeing the mark , he could run for the exit and beg to be allowed to leave , and damn the embarrassment and the film job he would lose . The moment passed . They were rolling , sluggishly at first , then galloping , screaming like an insane bird , breakneck down the runway . What a lunatic way for a man to travel from one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back into the seat as the aircraft 's nose tilted up and the jet shot off the runway . The airport buildings appeared close enough to hook the slanting wing outside his window . A loss of power now and everything would end in a smashed heap in the shallow waters of the bay . With a surge , they rose like a soaring arrow up across the oceanfront beaches and higher and higher out across the sea , until they became a fleck of glinting metal against the blue backdrop of the sky . Inside the passenger compartment the NO SMOKING sign winked out . Spencer 's hand went automatically to his breast pocket , searching for a cigarette pack that was n't there . He had given up smoking . Now was one of the times he wished he had n't . Somewhere on the periphery of his consciousness , he could hear the stewardess delivering her " abandon ship " lecture in case it became necessary to ditch in midocean . The stewardess had delivered this same set speech at least a hundred times before . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind on other  | things , like an actress who had been in the same role too long . Spencer had heard the speech at least a dozen times , but it still unnerved him . His shirt felt cool and clammy . He held it away from his chest with his fingertips . Thank God there were no more alternatives . Alternatives created tension . There was nothing left for him to do except relax as best he could and wait out the remaining hours of the flight . When the movie job was over , he could cash in the remaining half of his airline ticket and return by boat . He rang for the stewardess and bought a pack of cigarettes . When he finished his cigarette , he got out of his seat and started up the aisle in search of the toilet . He sensed he was being watched . His actor 's antennae could feel the eyes caressing him even before he saw the girl . She was sitting in the last row of seats in the section , beside a young man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy appeared to be together , but they did n't match . He was selfconsciously conservative . She was determinedly mod , with straw-colored hair , long and straight ; small features in a round face ; and mini breasts pushing up molehills under her turtleneck jersey . In fact , everything seemed small in the top half of her except her eyes , which were big and gray and made to look even bigger with black liner , the only makeup she wore . She nudged the boy beside her with an elbow and indicated with her eyes for him to look where she was looking , at Spencer . The boy looked up , puzzled , and then looked back at the girl questioningly , as if to ask , " What 's so special about this tall , skinny gent shambling up the aisle ? " Sadly , Spencer could understand the boy 's reaction . The teasing question was how the girl had recognized him . As he passed their seats he nodded , just a little , and managed one of his best sheepish smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little straighter . The boy just looked more puzzled . Perhaps even annoyed . As he shut the door to the toilet behind him , Spencer wondered  | whether the girl had indeed recognized him . Maybe , in her eyes , he had just looked vaguely familiar and she was being polite just to be safe . Maybe she thought he was some acquaintance or associate of her father 's . Examining his face , full front and three-quarter profile in the mirror , he had to concede that maybe it was neither of the above suppositions . Maybe she just thought he was a damned goodlooking man . He wondered what two kids like that were doing traveling first class anyway . He took off his jacket and hung it on a hook . Then he peeled off his shirt and his sweat-soaked undershirt , moistened a paper towel , and sponged his torso until the clammy feeling was gone . He threw his wet undershirt into the waste-towel bin , put his shirt back on , and left the washroom . He returned down the aisle to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy again . But he thought he could feel her eyes on his back . They were almost three hours into the flight and halfway across the ocean when the girl came and sat down next to him . The stewardess had just picked up Spencer 's lunch tray , with the remnants of the meal he had only toyed with . And he had returned his attention to the wing , making his regular survey of the surface , to be certain that it had not become stained with leaking oil or any other such danger signal . So when he felt someone lean toward him across the seat , he assumed it was the stewardess with the coffee . It was the girl . She was taller than he would have imagined from the first look he had had of her , with a lithe torso and long legs . " Pardon me , " she inquired in a bright , innocent voice , " but are you Roy Spencer ? " She had recognized him . A warm glow lighted his face . He smiled up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms of both her hands to her cheeks . " I thought so , " she said . " But I had to make sure . " " Well , it was very nice of you to come by , " said Spencer .  | The girl nodded and did n't move , except to plant one pale knee on the empty seat next to his and lean a little closer , examining his face intently . " I just ca n't get over it , " she said ingenuously . " You look just exactly like in Lost Squadron . " " Oh , " Spencer drawled , " I 'm afraid I 've grown a few feet since then . " The girl 's eyes widened . " Crow's-feet , " he clarified , smiling at his little joke and showing his crow's-feet . " What 's a few crow's-feet ? " the girl bubbled . " The great thing is that you 're alive and well . We used to wonder ? " The girl stopped and looked chagrined . " I do n't blame you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time ago . Where did you ever see Lost Squad-ron ? " " Oh , " said the girl excitedly , " We saw more than that ! It got to be a kind of group activity . " She stopped again and looked at him questioningly . " Do you really want to know ? " Spencer nodded . It was more than just a matter of ego . He found this ebullient girl enchanting . He did n't want her to leave . " Well , it all happened pretty much for want of something else to do , if you do n't mind my saying so . You see , our pot dealer went home to visit his mother during Easter recess . " Spencer raised a quizzical eyebrow . " At school , " the girl explained . " Richie Gentry . He 's going for his M.A. in sociology . " " And he 's working his way through college selling hardware ? " " Not hardware , " the girl sighed , exasperated . " Pot . You do n't cook in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get your feathers ruffled , " said Spencer placatingly . " I read the newspapers . " " You must understand , " the girl said quickly , " he 's not what you would call a professional pusher or anything like that . It 's just that in his field of work he meets up with all kinds of people who have access to supply . He just passes the surplus on to us . You do n't approve ? " The girl looked stricken .  | Spencer shrugged . " I do n't approve or disapprove . I just do n't understand what the shouting 's all about . " The girl nodded , settled back into the seat with a slightly superior air , and wound one long limb sinuously around the other . " That 's because you never tried it . " " But I have , " said Spencer . The girl looked startled . " Oh , yes ! Way back long ago , before it became such a tribal thing to do . " " Then you know , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Spencer . " As I recall , it was an awful lot of work . All that frantic huffing and puffing . I never could decide whether the euphoria came from the smoke , or sheer exhaustion . " The girl giggled . Spencer went on reflectively . " I do n't know what Hollywood is like now . I would guess maybe the action has moved elsewhere . But back in those days we tried a little bit of everything , things I 'll bet you never even dreamed of . " The girl clapped her hands together excitedly . " Tell me about it ! Spencer considered her request for a tantalizing moment . Then he shook his head . " Nope . It was a long time ago . And if you really want to know the truth , I did n't find most of it of more than passing interest . " The girl looked disappointed . " Want to know what I 'm really interested in ? " asked Spencer . " What ? " the girl replied eagerly . " How you came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and then nodded her head in resignation . " O.K. Where was I ? " " Your pot supplier had gone home to visit his mother for Easter and left you high and dry . " " Actually just dry . " The girl smiled mischievously . " A high was out of the question . And we did n't have enough money to go anywhere off the campus . After a day or two we were going out of our skulls . So we decided a great thing to do would be to stay  | up all night long , watching every movie they ran between midnight and dawn . " So we took our Dexies and turned on the TV . And it turned out to be a real groove . They ran five of yours , one a night , five nights in a row . Lost Squadron , Undercover , Bombs Away , Agent of Mercy , Pursuit Pilot . And we all fell in love with you . Well , the girls did , anyway . " So then we decided it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we put our heads together and tore off a letter to MGM ? " The girl looked chagrined . " Go on . " The girl sighed . " Well , they said you were no longer under contract and they did n't know where any pictures could be obtained . Does that make you feel bad ? " Spencer smiled . " It 's just something old actors have to learn to live with . " The girl squinted up her eyes and examined his face carefully again . " You know , you really do n't look that old . " " Oh ? How old should I look ? " asked Spencer , amused . " What I mean is , for the length of time you 've been around ... you really do look great . " " Go on ! That 's just because you 're squinting . " The girl blinked her eyes and stopped squinting . " I was not squinting . " " Yes , you were . " " What has that got to do with it anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's shooting an aging star . " " He squints ? " " Well , he kind of squints with his lens . He puts the lens just the slightest bit out of focus . You ca n't do it very well on men , of course . It makes them look too soft . But for the ladies , it 's the fountain of youth . If the lighting is just right , and the lens is out of focus just enough , they look like wedding-cake angels . They kind of glow . "  | " Oh ! How great ! " the girl exclaimed , clapping her hands together and getting up on both knees in the seat . Spencer began to chuckle . The girl looked at him quizzically , wondering whether she 'd done something to provoke his amusement . " I was just thinking , " Spencer said . " Do you remember April Williams ? " The girl thought a moment . " She was in that picture with you . Undercover . She was the girl . " " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in on a secret . She was n't a girl anymore . Not even way back then . She 'd been around a lot longer than I had . She was forty-five if she was a day . " " She was forty-five in Undercover ? " " I 'm being generous . " " Too much ! " " Remember soft focus ? She had become a star playing fresh young things , and she was determined to go on playing them until hell froze over . " " Excuse me , Mr. Spencer . " It was the stewardess . " Would you like your coffee now ? " " Thank you , " said Spencer . He looked at the girl a little wistfully . " I guess you 'd better get back to your seat . " " And miss hearing about April Williams ? No such thing . " She turned to the stewardess . " I ' 11 have my coffee here , please . " The stewardess nodded and left them . " Now , " said the girl , curling up cozily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams . " " Well , " Spencer said , lighting a cigarette , " she was in the autumn of her career . Very late autumn . But she still had this great body . The only trouble was , her face was beginning to droop . Now , I 'm lucky . I 've just got wrinkles . But I still have my jawline  --  that 's the important thing . Hers just hung there . " " You 're not very wrinkled , " the girl protested . Spencer smiled , shooting crow's-feet all the way from the corners of his eyes to his sideburns.  | " Well , " the girl conceded , " maybe a little wrinkled . But hardly at all if I squint just right . " Spencer laughed . Not so much because what she had said was so funny , but just because she was there . The stewardess came with a pot of coffee , served them both , and departed . Spencer and the girl sipped their coffee . " Are n't you afraid that 'll keep you awake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the girl . " I plan to sleep as little as is humanly possible for the next two weeks . " She rummaged around in her purse , found a pill bottle , and flipped the cap off into her lap . " Want one ? " " Saccharine ? " Spencer asked . " Dexedrine , " the girl answered , popping one into her mouth and washing it down with a sip of coffee . " No , thanks , " said Spencer . " Coffee keeps me as awake as I want to be . " " Well , I 've been up since yesterday already . If it was n't for my Dexies I 'd really be strung out . They flew us out of L.A. last night on the red-eye special . Got us here with bare minutes to spare to catch this flight . " The girl began rummaging around in her purse again , could n't find what she was looking for , and finally asked Spencer for one of his cigarettes . " You know , " said Spencer , " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel agent who booked you . A night on the red-eye special and a day on the way to Europe is no way to start a honeymoon . " " Honeymoon ? " The girl let out a hoot and began coughing up smoke . Then she lowered her voice to an incredulous whisper . " With him ? " " I 'm sorry , " Spencer apologized . " I thought you were together . " " We are together , " said the girl , taking a thirsty drag on her cigarette . " And I 'm sorry too . " " Is he your brother ? " Spencer asked .  | The girl looked around conspiratorially , then leaned close to Spencer 's ear and whispered , " He 's my ? " She stopped , as smoke drifted out of her mouth with the words and enveloped Spencer 's head . " Excuse me , " she said , fanning the smoke away . " He 's my date . " " He 's your date ? " Spencer asked incredulously . " Shhhh , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief . " You 'll wake him up . " She giggled , ground out her cigarette in the ashtray , and tucked her feet up under her in the chair . " He 's not your date , is he ? " " Oh , " the girl sighed , " he 's my date , all right . I won him on a quiz show . " Spencer laughed . " You really are too much . " The girl held up a hand and rolled her big gray eyes heavenward . " God 's truth . I won him along with this trip to Europe . Young David Eisenhower . " " Now I know you 're pulling my leg . That is not young David Eisenhower . " " Of course it 's not . His real name is Paul Henderson . I just call him young David Eisenhower because he 's so damned earnest . And protective ? You would n't believe it . I know grandfathers who are n't that protective . Why , if he were awake now he 'd be down here all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young David Eisenhower is a total waste . That 's why I put him to sleep . " " What did you do , pop him on the head with a loaded purse ? " " Nothing so gross . I opened a Seconal and sprinkled it in his chowder along with a handful of oysterettes . " Spencer was appalled . But he could n't help laughing . " You are a regular walking pharmacy . A pill for every occasion . " The girl nodded her head impishly . " And , occasionally , a pill for a pill . " Up front , one of the stewardesses lowered a screen . " Our movie today , " a voice announced over the intercom , " will be Water Planet , starring Janice Franklin and Neil McDevitt. "  | " Nothing ! " said the girl disdainfully . Spencer looked pleased . " If you wish to watch the movie , " the voice continued , " you will find hearing sets , and instructions , in the pouch on the seat directly in front of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl said . " We ca n't help watching , " Spencer replied . " But we do n't have to listen . " " Let 's not listen , then . Why accept substitutes ? I 've got you . " The screen lit up . Emerald-green water . CO2 bubbles . A man in scuba gear swims slowly toward the camera . Closer . Closer . Until his masked face fills the screen . " You know something , " said Spencer : " I know both of your escort 's names . But I do n't know your name at all . " " Bernadette , " said the girl . " Bernadette Finletter . " TWENTY NICK HOLLISTER was on the way to his car , ready to start the drive to the airport and catch the flight to Paris , when he heard the phone ring . He hesitated a moment and then , overcome with a feeling of impending disaster , raced for the front door of the house . After even a few minutes outside , the smell of stale smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shin-bruising path through a maze of disarranged furniture in the darkening study and grabbed the phone . It was Mahon with word of the last-minute change in plans . Hollister 's bowels turned to water . Sanchon , a skilled and subtle thief , was waiting in Paris with a duplicate of Spencer 's bag , shipped from New York the week before . Sanchon was to have made the switch as the luggage came off the plane , picking up the plutonium-loaded suitcase and leaving , in its place , the ringer packed with odd items of ballast . Emboa 's representative was in Paris too , waiting at the  | airport to receive the contraband , transfer it to his diplomatic pouch , and depart for a rendezvous with the Curator of Official Documents . Everything had been carefully arranged for a reception in Paris . But the package was on its way to Rome . Hollister hung up the phone and leaned heavily on the desk , breathing laboriously and shaking his head dumbly , like a fighter who had taken too many punches and was hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter were at stake . And his mind was paralyzed , incapable of innovative thought . He pounded the top of the desk in futile rage until his fist grew numb . His agonized curses echoed hollowly around the house as his panicked brain riffled through a mental index of vaporously unsubstantial alternatives . He could call the kidnappers in the States and offer them more money than Emboa was paying them . He knew they would n't listen . He could fly over and free the hostages himself . He knew there was no way he could get there before tomorrow morning , and by then , even were he able to force his way into the lake house , it would be too late . The deadline was tonight . He could notify the local police . But he knew that if a rescue attempt was made , the first people to die would be his wife and daughter . He could fly to Rome and murder Emboa . But that would not alter the fate of his family . Emboa was the only one who could issue an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbler half full of cognac and drank it down like water . He could kill himself and rid himself of the problem . But his wife and daughter would still have to face their executioners . He had brought them into this hell . He owed it to them to stay alive , at least long enough to exhaust every effort to bring them out . Hollister looked at his watch . The airplane carrying the plutonium was still two hours out of Paris , five hours out of Rome . There was a way . But he would have to work quickly . Contact  | Sanchon in Paris  --  page him at the airport if he had already left his flat . Get Sanchon on a flight to Rome . There would be no neat switching of luggage . He or Sanchon , if Sanchon could make it to Rome in time , would have to follow the girl and her bags , all the way to her hotel if necessary . Somehow they would have to take the girl 's luggage before she had a chance to open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baggage was stolen every day . But the first thing he would have to do would be contact Emboa , plead with him if necessary , explain the change in delivery procedure , assure him of the efficacy of his alternative plan . The package would arrive in Rome rather than Paris . It would be just a matter of a few hours ' delay . Just a few hours more , and Emboa would have his prize . He would have to agree to a reprieve . He would have to agree to wait if he wanted the plutonium at all . Only Mahon and Hollister knew the identity of the person carrying the package . Hollister picked up the phone and placed a call to the Cinobar embassy in Rome . Thirty minutes later Hollister was back in his car , mind clear and clicking , his tired body responding to the invigorating chill of the evening breeze . Emboa had agreed to the reprieve . Sanchon would meet him in Rome , in time to follow the girl and her luggage . Emboa would personally take delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no later than noon tomorrow . Hollister took the last corner down the hillside road in an exuberant skidding turn and pointed his car toward the highway to Genoa and the airport . TWENTY-ONE IN THE passenger section of the airplane , the face of the man in scuba gear fills the screen . The scene dissolves . Reverse angle . A formation of swimmers , grotesque in rubber monster suits ,  | menacingly follow the lone man across the screen . Trails of bubbles animate into the movie 's opening title  --  WATER PLANET . " Bernadette , " Spencer repeated thoughtfully . " It 's an unusual name . After the saint ? " " Nope , " said the girl . " After the song . " Spencer looked at her , puzzled . The Song of Bernadette , the girl explained patiently . " You mean the movie ? " " Well , whatever it was . Dad was so moved by it that he proposed to Mom , or so the family legend goes . So when I finally came after years of waiting , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Bernadette . " " Very sentimental , " said Spencer approvingly . " Sure it was , " said the girl . " Except it was like after they had accomplished me there was nothing else to shoot for . So they got divorced . And guess who got custody of me ? " Spencer shrugged . " Since you put it that way , I 'd guess it was your father . " " Wrong , " said the girl , almost gleefully . " My grandmother . " " I 'm sorry , " said Spencer . " No need to be . She was a really great old lady . Give me another cigarette and finish about April Williams . " Spencer patted around his pockets in search of the cigarettes . " You know , it occurs to me it probably is n't really very nice to tell that story in public . " The girl got up on her knees in the seat and crossed her heart ceremoniously . " I wo n't tell a soul . I promise . " " Well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's probably told enough on me . " He lit the girl 's cigarette and then tapped one out for himself . " Well , it became apparent halfway through the shooting schedule that Miss April was in dire need of another face-lift . But the delay would have strained the production budget . And I was on a tight schedule , too . I had another picture to start . So the makeup man just taped up her jowls . "  | " Ugh ! " The girl made a face . " Oh , it does n't show . And it 's absolutely painless . You just stick the tape , flesh-colored , high up on the side of the face , sort of along the back of the jawline , right in front of the ear . And then you lift , and tie it down behind the ear . It really tightens things up . And a girl has got hair long enough to cover it . I guess even a man does nowadays . " " And you were shooting her out of focus anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , " said Spencer . " So there we were in this big romantic close-up , and zap ! The tape gives way on the right side of her face , and her right jowl drops . " The girl bit her lip to keep from laughing out loud . " I mean , " said Spencer , " it was really hanging out there , and quivering a little from the fall , like a hungry bloodhound 's . " The girl clapped her hand over her mouth , pulled her head down between her shoulders like a turtle , and began to giggle . Spencer , enchanted , watched her a moment , and then he went on . " But that 's not the end of it . You see , that sudden landslide on the right side must have put a strain on the other tape . And about two seconds later , the left side gave way . " Now Spencer collapsed , laughing . The girl pressed her palm over his mouth . " Shhh , " she whispered , inclining her head toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl sat huddled down in their chairs , eyes brimming with tears , trying to choke back the laughter . " What happened then ? " the girl asked , when they had finally settled down . " The director saved the piece of film to show to his friends when the party got dull . And they blew the budget and delayed production while April had a proper face-lift and I finished the next picture on my schedule . So it all turned out happily in the end . Undercover made a pot of money . " " It was a great picture , " said the girl . " It was fun , " said Spencer , thinking back on those days . " Most  | of them were fun . " Then he looked at the girl , looking at him with the same kind of adoration with which the girls had looked at him a generation ago , and he became melancholy at the thought that this girl had n't even been conceived when most of those pictures were made . " Do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I told you , " said the girl , annoyed , " he is not any friend of mine . " " You did n't win him on a quiz show . " She held up three fingers like a Girl Scout taking the oath . " I did . I came down to L.A. to find a summer job . But they had all these free TV shows . So I just spent my time going from show to show . It was a groove . And on this one I got picked to be a contestant . Match and Mate . You know . Four guys hide behind a screen and a girl asks them questions . She picks the one she 'd most like to have a date with . " " Why did you pick him if you did n't like him ? " " I told you . He was behind a screen . How did I know I would n't like him ? All I knew was he had the nicest-sounding voice of the four . Did I make a mistake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for young David Eisenhower , " the girl continued : " he knows his categories . When it came to answering the money questions , he took us through Las Vegas and Mexico City and wound up winning Rome . " She stopped a moment , struck with a thought . " Are you getting off in Rome ? " " Not right away , " said Spencer . " I 'm going to break the flight in Paris and go on to Rome in a few days . I 'm starting a new picture there next week . " The girl 's eyes lit up . " Oh ! How great . Tell me about it ? No . Wait . " She pulled open her purse and fished hurriedly around until she came up with her Dexedrine bottle . Spencer watched in dismay as she tapped out a pill . " What are you doing ? " " Just a little pep-up. "  | " You 'll go out through the roof . You had one just a little while ago . " " Did I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her finger . " You 're right , I did . Thanks . " She dropped the pill back into the bottle and the bottle back into her purse . Then she wriggled around in the seat until she had made a cozy nest for herself and listened while Spencer told her the story of the picture he 'd be working in . In the back of the compartment , Paul Henderson slept on . The big jet , five hours out of New York , howled across the sky into the onrushing dusk and the nighttime side of the world . TWENTY-TWO FLIGHT 507 flattened out at the bottom of a long , powered glide that had begun thirty minutes before over the English Channel , a glide so gentle in its slope that the passengers , in their pressurized cabin , would have been unaware of the descent except for the change in skyscape . The featherbed clouds that had lain thousands of feet below , silvered with moonlight and deceptively substantial in appearance , had become a vaporous mist that had engulfed them . Now the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , blotting out the stars and encapsuling the world . The world , their world , was almost within touching distance below them . Towns , like nests of fireflies , winked busily in the night . Automobile headlights probed the darkness , moving , disembodied , down unseen paths scored in the countryside . The opaque land tilted at angles away from the transparency of the sky , and then tilted back again as the pilot jockeyed his craft into position for the final leg of this first part of his flight . Paris , casting its halo into the sky like a false dawn , lay directly ahead . The NO SMOKING sign began to flash . Spencer stretched and  | looked around . The girl was in the back of the compartment , leaning over the sleeping Paul Henderson . She had left the seat beside Spencer five minutes before , when the pilot had announced that they were approaching Paris . Spencer mused wistfully that if they had only been on a ship instead of a plane , their hours together would have been days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she returned home and told her friends , as she had said she would , how she had sat most of the way to Europe with Roy Spencer , her friends would treat the experience with fitting awe and not ask , " Roy who ? " He snapped on his seat belt and leaned toward the window to see if he could spot the Eiffel Tower . " Here . Hold this while I get my belt on . " It was the girl , in the seat beside him again and , from her voice , in a state of high excitement . She handed him a paper cup of water . Then she snapped on her own seat belt , talking all the while , her eyes alight with mischief . " My prize ' is still in never-never land . I do n't know how they 're going to get him off the plane in Rome . But that 's their problem . The stewardess was a little ticked off when I told her , but . . . " " You told her you slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl looked at him in disbelief . " What kind of a nut do you think I am ? Of course I did n't tell her that . I just told her I wanted to get off in Paris . " " But . . . " Spencer swallowed hard , trying to sort out a confusion of feelings of apprehension and delight . " You 're ticketed to Rome . " " So are you . I 'm just going to break my ticket , just like you did . Do n't worry . It 's all arranged . " " But why ? " Spencer asked obtusely , already knowing the answer . " Why , to be with you . Oh , do n't look so scared . If you do n't want me tagging along , I 'll see Paris by myself . "  | Spencer sighed , and pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger . " You look like you 've got a headache , " the girl chirped . Spencer nodded . " Well , there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl exclaimed petulantly while she searched around in her purse . " I can go wherever I please . " She found her pill bottle , tapped out a tablet , and swallowed it down with a gulp of water from her paper cup . " Have n't you had enough of those ? " Spencer asked reprovingly . " Now , do n't tell me you 're going to pick up where young David left off ? If there 's one thing I do n't all of a sudden need at my age , it 's a father . I 'm over twenty-one . " " I surely do hope so , " sighed Spencer . The cabin loudspeaker crackled alive . " This is Captain Thomson . We are approaching Orly Airport and will be landing in five minutes . Please observe the smoking regulations and be sure your seat belts are fastened . We hope you have enjoyed your flight . And for those getting off in Paris , we wish you a pleasant stay . Thank you . " The loudspeaker clicked off and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure the passengers were all strapped in . Spencer and the girl stood together , a little off to the side from where most of the other travelers were clustered , awaiting their baggage in the customs area at Orly . The girl was nervous and excited . She kept glancing up at the clock on the wall , and then behind her at the door through which they had come . " What 's taking them so long with the bags ? " she whispered through clenched teeth . " Patience , " advised Spencer . " Patience . Paris wo n't turn into a pumpkin at midnight . "  | " I know that , " said the girl . " But any minute now I expect to see young Prince Charming come galloping through that door looking to rescue me . I mean , how long can a body sleep on one Seconal ? " She began to nibble anxiously on a fingernail . " When does that plane get off the ground again for Rome ? " " In about ten minutes . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I 'll fight him off , just like in the movies . " " Would you ? " " Well , I guess I could n't . I do n't have my stunt man along . " " You 're terrible . Look ! " The girl grabbed Spencer 's and started to pull him across the room . " Here they come now ! " Baggage of every kind had begun parading out of a slot in the wall onto a huge rotating turntable where it passed in review before the waiting travelers . Spencer and the girl claimed their pieces and rolled them on a cart across to the customs table . " Have you been through this before ? " the girl asked a little apprehensively . " Dozens of times , " said Spencer . " What do they do ? " " Just check to make sure you 're not bringing in anything illegal , like pep pills , barbiturates , stuff like that . " The girl stopped and looked at him in dismay . Then she saw the laughter in his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully . Spencer let her off the hook with a nod . They started pushing their cart again . " Since you are a pretty young American girl bringing in beautiful green American dollars , they really are n't too interested in anything else you might be bringing in . They will merely ask you if you have anything to declare . A formality . You will say , Nothing . ' And they will mark your baggage with a piece of chalk and pass you through . " " Is that all ? " " That 's all . Unless you persist in looking behind you like you were being followed . Otherwise you look too young and innocent  | to be a dope smuggler . You do n't have an Interpol warrant on your head , do you ? " The girl looked at him . " No . " A pause . " But I bet it would be a groove . " Spencer lifted their bags up onto the counter and started to slide them down toward the customs inspector . " But let me caution you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a different story . " " Are you putting me on again ? " " No , I 'm not . The U.S. customs people are not nearly as accommodating as the Europeans are . In fact , they are damn near paranoid . By the way , do you speak French ? " The girl shook her head No . " That 's even better for this end of it , then . They will ask you , in French first , if you have anything to declare . Since you wo n't understand them , they will consider you especially naive and certainly incapable of conspiring to deceive them . " " Do you speak French ? " the girl asked , wondering for the first time about getting along in a non  --  English-speaking country . " Enough to get by , " said Spencer . " But I will see to it that the customs men regard me also as a naive philistine . I am , you may recall , an actor . " " Rien a declarer ? " intoned the customs inspector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man marked her bags with chalk and turned to Spencer . Outside the airport building , in the cool suburban night , Spencer and the girl waited in line for a cab . The girl took a deep breath and closed her eyes . " Mmmm . Smell that delicious French air . " " Airport air , " said Spencer perversely . " Smells the same the world over . Like kerosene . " The girl looked stricken . " That 's the kind of thing I 'd expect to hear from young David . " And then , " Do you suppose the plane has left yet ? "  | Spencer looked at his watch and nodded . " Just about . " Their cab , a Citroen , pulled up , and the driver placed their luggage in the trunk . Then Spencer and the girl climbed into the back seat for the ride to Paris . " You 're right , " said the girl glumly , looking out the side window past the reflection of her own face superimposed over the darkened countryside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Spencer sighed . " Forget what I said about kerosene . Only jaded old men say things like that . " " No , " the girl insisted . " You were right . It did smell of .. . something . " " Uh-uh , " Spencer grunted . " I smelled jet fuel . You smelled French perfume . That 's the difference between an old nose and a young one . Maybe you can help me to smell like a youth again . " " Oh . . . " drawled the girl , pursing her lips , " you do n't smell so musty to me . " They rode on through the Parisian suburbs , enjoying each other , enjoying the songs of a French troubadour on the cab radio . At one point the girl turned to Spencer , an almost pugnacious look on her face . " You know what I thought ? " she asked . " What did you think ? " " I thought that when we landed there would be all kinds of newspaper reporters , and photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " For you . " " For me ? " Spencer shrugged . " I 'm not a world-famous quizshow prize-winner . " The girl stopped , tilted her head , and considered that for a moment , deriving secret pleasure from the thought . Then she sighed . " No . I do n't think anyone over here would ever have heard of Match and Mate . But I thought they would be here for you . You 're a movie star . "  | Spencer 's face darkened . " The last time I was mobbed , I was getting off the Twentieth Century Limited . Do you know how long ago that was ? " " Tell me what the Twentieth Century Limited was and I 'll tell you . " " A train . " The girl looked at him in disbelief . " A train ? " " In the olden days ? " Spencer made his voice quiver ? " that 's the way folks traveled . " The girl laughed and slapped at the air in front of his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spencer sighed . " They do n't arrange things like that for me anymore . " The girl bristled . " What do you mean , arrange ' ? " " The public relations people . " " Are you trying to tell me that those mob scenes for The Stones and The Beatles and all the rest are all set up ? " " Well , somebody has to let the people know they 're coming . " The girl scrunched down in her seat and pouted . " I 'll make a bet with you , " said Spencer cajolingly . " I 'll bet you Paul McCartney or anyone else you want to name could walk down just about any street in the world unmobbed . Oh ; a few heads would turn . And some people would nudge each other and say , Look who 's there . ' But unless there was a press agent around to whip up a demonstration , your hero could walk alone . " " How do you know so much about what would happen to Paul McCartney ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once McCartney , and The Beatles , and The Stones all rolled into one . " The girl looked up at him in awe . " I guess you were . " " Welcome to Paris . " They had reached the edge of the city proper , a dismal area of shuttered buildings and dimly lit narrow streets . The girl looked out the window in dismay . " It could be Hoboken. "  | " You 're beginning to sound like a jaded old lady , " Spencer teased . The girl folded her arms across her chest , groaned , and made herself very small . " Maybe I should have gone to Rome . " Spencer leaned forward and spoke a few words in French to the driver . The driver nodded , shifted gears , and sent the car careening around a corner at right angles to the direction in which they had been going . The girl sat bolt upright , alarmed . " hold on ! I did n't mean it . " " Mean what ? " Spencer asked innocently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relax . I did n't tell him to take us back to the airport . " " Then what did you tell him ? " " I told him that this is my daughter 's first trip to Paris and that she is sadly disappointed . And to show us the sights . " " I 'm your daughter ? " " How else could I explain you ? " The interior of the cab became flooded with lights as the taxi shot onto the Pont du Carrousel and across the Seine . The Place de la Concorde erupted around them like a starburst . " Wow ! " the girl exclaimed . " What 's this ? " " This is the place where Marie Antoinette lost her head . " " I do n't wonder , " said the girl , round-eyed , as she hugged Spencer 's arm . The taxi circled the colossal plaza , adding its own small incandescence to the spectacular Catherine wheel of light revolving around the obelisk . Then the driver veered right , moving slowly up the Champs Elysees toward the Etoile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speechless , with mouth agape , clutching Spencer 's arm . " Still look like Hoboken ? " The girl did n't answer  --  not for a while . Then she said softly , " You know what I 'm going to write in my diary tonight ? The  | most out-of-sight day in my life . I flew across the ocean . I met a movie star . I saw Paris . And ... ' " she looked up at him with the lights of the boulevard dancing in her eyes . . . " I slept with my " father . " ' " Spencer swallowed hard . " Just make sure you do n't mention any names in that diary of yours . " TWENTY-THREE " I 'M TELLING you I was drugged ! " Paul Henderson 's whine soared above the babble in the TWA manager 's office at Leonardo da Vinci Airport , outside Rome . " Well , is n't somebody going to do something ? " He sat on a hard chair in a corner of the room , clinging with both hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashbulbs of the paparazzi popped . Fifteen minutes earlier , with the aid of two strong security men and trailed by the flight stewardess , he had been helped through the airport building in a semicomatose condition . His delirious shouts of druggings and kidnappings had brought the lurking photographers running in pursuit of what they hoped would develop into a profitably lurid story . Paul took another gulp of coffee , blinked at the poised cameras , and cried , " Good Lord ! I 'm responsible for that girl . " The photographers triggered their shutters again and mentally composed their captions . The office manager came out of his huddle with the stewardess , pushed his way through the crowd , and climbed up onto his desk . The photographers tilted their cameras up at him and waited for their shot . The room became quiet . " She may be locked up in some seraglio , " Paul wailed , as if obliged to fill the sound vacuum . The room exploded again .  | It took an effort of patient but unrelenting pleas and gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semblance of order . Then he spoke , in Italian . " You might just as well save your film and your flashbulbs , and save us all a sleepless night . There is no story here . " The paparazzi cast uneasy glances from the manager , to the boy to one another . Their cameras , with no place to point , became awkward encumberances . The manager continued . " The young man here slept through part of a long flight . He woke up in a confused condition , and the girl with whom he had been traveling was gone . . . " The room burst into sound and excitement again . " But . . . " shouted the manager , " But . . . actually nothing out of the ordinary occurred . The girl did not vanish . She was not abducted . " Groans of disappointment . " Nor did anything in any way mysterious happen to her . " More unhappy sounds . " The girl spoke to our stewardess shortly before the plane landed in Paris . She wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . They will do it countless times again . " The girl got off the plane in Paris of her own volition . That is all there is to it . " " What about the boy ? " a photographer shouted . " Why did n't she tell him ? " called another , seeking some explanation that might make the pictures he had already taken marketable . " I 'm afraid . . . " The office manager paused , trying to come up with an explanation that would be true and satisfactory and not hurt the boy . Finally he shrugged and simply said , " Who can explain today 's young women ? " The photographers grumbled . But looking at Paul Henderson clutching his coffee cup  --  puffy-faced , red-eyed , hair wet and matted from having had his head put under the cold-water faucet  --  they could plainly see why the girl had simply ducked out on him . Mumbling complaints to one another , they shuffled out  | of the room to await another story with potential . Paul Henderson sat sullenly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at the office manager and the stewardess . Hollister and Sanchon , who had followed the hysterical boy and his entourage of airline personnel and photographers across the waiting room and into the office , drifted out with the last of the paparazzi . Outside the office , Hollister stopped and leaned with his palm against a pillar to steady himself . He felt faint . His tongue felt dry , and so large he had trouble swallowing . His face felt cold . Colored dots danced in front of his eyes . He had run out of time . His deadline for delivery was tomorrow at noon . And he knew he did n't have a chance in the world of finding that girl in Paris tonight . Yet he would have to meet Emboa at the appointed place tomorrow . He had no option left , except to bluff . But he had bluffed before and won . TWENTY-FOUR SPENCER AND the girl registered at the Hotel Meurice , on the Rue de Rivoli , and were given rooms directly across the hall from each other . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket on the bedpost , and was just about to flop , exhausted into an inviting armchair when there was a knock at the door . It was the girl . Spencer stood nonplussed while she arched up onto her toes , threw her arms around his neck , and bussed him lightly on the lips . Then she darted into the room , dropped her purse on the bed , and flitted from one tall French window to the other , parting the damask drapes and peering out at the view of the Tuileries Gardens and the Seine .  | " Do n't you want to unpack and get some sleep ? " Spencer asked , still standing in the open doorway . " Manana , " the girl answered , opening and closing all the drawers and closets in the room . She opened the bathroom door ; glanced inside ; closed it ; paused a moment , puzzled ; and opened it again . " What 's that thing in there ? " she asked . " What thing ? " " Well , come see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of extra toilet bowl , except it has faucets like a sink . " Spencer closed the hall door and collapsed against it , laughing . " That 's the bidet . " " The bee-what ? " " Bee-day , " Spencer enunciated . " The last word in hygiene . No respectable European home is without one . " Spencer flopped down into the armchair . " Well , what do you do with it ? " Spencer thought a moment . " If you are a barbaric American tourist , you rinse your socks in it . " " Is that what it 's really for ? " the girl asked , moving sinuously across the room toward him . " If you 're a barbaric American tourist . " " And if I 'm not ? " she asked , planting herself challengingly in front of him . Spencer found the look of her disconcerting . The girl moved closer , slid down onto the arm of his chair , and began fondling his earlobe . " Well ? " " Well , " said Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her fine , round buttock had found a nesting place in the palm of his hand . " Well ? " the girl persisted . Spencer became uncomfortably aware that it was in situations like this that dirty old men were born . " Well  --  if you are an elegant Continental lady , you  --  wash your private parts in it . "  | And he slapped her bottom , as if for emphasis  --  but more sharply than mere emphasis would have required , in a conscious effort to break the mood and free himself from the libidinous vortex into which he was being drawn . The girl let go of his ear and sat bolt upright , eyes wide and round . " You 're putting me on ! " " I can see , " said Spencer , feeling clean and righteous and in control of his wits again , " that you are obviously a barbaric American tourist . " " I 'll show you who 's a barbarian , " said the girl , springing out of his lap and flouncing across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , hoping he had n't pushed the teasing too far . " Why , to wash my bottom in the bee-day , " the girl answered . And with a toss of her head , she marched off into the bathroom . Spencer sighed and resigned himself . There was no use fighting fate . What would be , would be . And plainly , this would be the night he would become a dirty old man . And having arrived at that not unpleasant understanding with himself , he picked up the phone , dialed Room Service , and ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon . Then , bone-weary from the long overseas flight and lulled by the soothing sound of lapping water , he succumbed to the cozy embrace of the easy chair and let his eyelids grow heavy . Something like the sound of a child 's popgun went off at his side , jarring him awake . He could n't have been dozing long . The girl and a waiter stood grinning down at him . The waiter was holding a champagne cork in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . The girl was holding a large bath towel around her middle in lieu of a skirt . She was still wearing the turtleneck jersey she had been traveling in . " Compliments of the management , " the girl chirped . " I was on  | the bee-day when he knocked , and you were so freaked out you did n't even hear . " " Where did you get the idea this was compliments of the house ? " Spencer asked , tasting the champagne sample the waiter had poured for his approval . Spencer nodded . The waiter filled the girl 's glass and then Spencer 's . Then Spencer signed the waiter 's proffered bill . " Oh . " The girl looked disappointed . " I just thought , you being a name and all  --  I mean , when he arrived at the door like that with his dear little cart ? " The waiter bowed and left . The girl moved on bare feet over to where her purse lay on the bed . She held the towel in place with her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand she found her pill bottle , flipped off the top , and tipped out a capsule . Spencer followed her across the room . " You had one before the plane landed , " he remonstrated . " That was ages ago . " She swallowed the pill down with a sip of champagne . " Mmmm . " She ran her tongue over her lips and tilted her head thoughtfully . " I think I 'll write in my diary that I like champagne . It tastes like velvet . Would you believe that I 've never tasted champagne before ? " Spencer said nothing , just watched the girl as she sipped delightedly from her glass . " Well , I have n't , " she said . She saw the longing and the sadness in his eyes . " What are you thinking ? " " That I wish I was as young as young David Eisenhower . " " Why ? " " So I could kiss your lips and not feel lousy about it afterwards . " " I kissed you when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips with his . " How do you feel ? " the girl asked . For an answer Spencer touched her lips with his again .  | " And I 'll note in my diary , " said the girl , " that a movie star 's lips taste like champagne . " She drained her glass and surveyed him with dancing eyes . " Can I have some more ? " " Wine ? Or movie star 's lips ? " " Some of both . " Spencer handed her his glass , from which he had only taken a sip . And he thought how much like the champagne she was , all velvety bright and bubblingly alive . " Why are you looking at me like that ? " " Because you tickle my nose . I do n't think I 've ever known a girl as young as you . " " Sure you did , " said the girl . " When you were twenty . " " Not even then , " said Spencer . " When I was twenty , the girls were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were as old as I was . " " I 'm sorry , " the girl sighed . Spencer nodded . " Can we have some more champagne ? " " Why not ? " said Spencer . He picked up the glasses and crossed to the serving cart . The girl followed and watched as he poured . " It 's a beautiful color , is n't it ? " she said . " But it 's not really golden . I always thought champagne was golden . But it 's kind of ever so pale a tan . " " It 's a color all its own , " said Spencer , handing her a glass . A sudden , involuntary yawn overcame the girl . Spencer smiled . " Why are you smiling like that ? " the girl protested . " You just yawned . " " I did not , " said the girl defensively . And then , surprised , she covered her mouth as another yawn crept up on her . Spencer was amused . " You are a child , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's past your bedtime . And do n't look so mad . You just saved me from becoming a dirty old man . " The girl tried to look fearsome , with lower lip jutting . But her big eyelids had grown heavy . " I 'll show you what a child I am . " She put her wineglass down , stood up on her toes , and laced  | her arms around his neck , clamping her firm body tight against him , so that the towel was being held around her by the pressure of her pelvis against his . Her mouth opened languidly over his . He could feel her body encroaching greedily on his , and then go limp . A soft sigh escaped from her mouth into his . Then her head fell back on a neck grown rubbery . She was yawning again . " Oh , " she moaned plaintively , trying to swallow down the yawn . " Nothing 's happening . " " I do n't wonder , " said Spencer , holding her against him now to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Asleep ? Ca n't be asleep . " Her speech had become slurred , and she looked at him quizzically , to see if he had noticed it too . She blinked her eyes . " I just took a  --  Oh , dear God . " She pushed away from Spencer and moved , like an image in a slowed-down film , across the room toward the bed , where her purse lay . Halfway there , her hand forgot its hold on the towel and the towel slipped down , clung for a few steps around her ankles , and then lay , abandoned , on the floor . Spencer , nonplussed , watched her buttocks bouncing across the room like a pair of surreal balloons . When she reached her purse , she picked up the pill bottle and brought it close to her unfocusing eyes . " Oh ! " she groaned . " This is the worst thing that ever happened to me . I took the downer instead of the Dexi . " She yawned again , deeply , and started moving back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretched to him , like a sleepwalking child . Spencer moved quickly to her and caught her before she could topple . She was almost asleep on her feet . " And all the time , " she moaned , while he held her limp young body in his arms , " all the time I thought my head was buzzing  --  from  --  champagne . " She sighed , and her head fell forward onto his chest . With his arms locked behind her back he walked her , like a  | man dancing with a rag doll , over to the bed . He sat her near the head of the bed and held her there while he pulled the covers down . Then he swung her bare legs up onto the bed and covered them with the blanket . She was breathing deeply , sound asleep , snoring just a little . He kissed her lightly on the forehead . Then he went back to the big , soft armchair and finished the bottle of champagne by himself . And fell asleep , by himself , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a crack . The pearly glow of dawn and a sound of running water had buoyed him from the depths of sleep to the surface of consciousness . He was puzzled to find himself in a soft armchair , facing an empty , unmade bed , in a strange , somewhat palatial room that was certainly not his own . His heart began to race . He was n't at home . He did n't know where he was . But he had a plane to catch . But  --  that was another day . Or was it ? Yes ! That was yesterday . And he had caught his plane , and had gotten off in Paris with a girl . And he put her to bed , in the bed across from him that was empty and unmade . Now he had it all sorted out . He also had a headache from too much champagne . Harsh incandescent light spilled out through the half-open doorway to the bathroom . The sound of running water was coming from there . " Bernadette ? " he called . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really awake at last ? " the girl sang back . " Or are you just talking in your sleep ? " Spencer tried to get out of the chair . It was an effort . It seemed that every muscle in his shoulders and back had ossified during  | the night . " Who was the one who fell asleep on her feet last night ? " he asked . " There 'll be no more of that , " she chimed . " I flushed all the downers down the toilet this morning before I took my wake-up pill . " The tap water began running again . Spencer stretched . He felt as if he had been broken on the rack . He crossed to the mirror over the bureau and examined his face . It had not benefited from a night spent sleeping in a chair . A face as old as his needed a rest from the tug of gravity . He made a face at the mirror like that of a roaring lion . Then he massaged the flesh at his temples and along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his eyes , winked at himself , practiced a smile . A rinse with cold water , a shave and a hair comb and he 'd begin to look like the old Roy Spencer  --  or , rather , the young Roy Spencer . Well , he 'd begin to look like himself . He crossed back to the champagne serving cart beside the easy chair , poured some water from the ice bucket into a glass , rinsed it around in his mouth and , having no place to spit , swallowed the stale stuff down . Then he dipped his hands into the bucket and patted the cool water onto his cheeks and around his eyes . Using his handkerchief as a towel , he crossed to where his suitcase lay on a stand at the foot of the bed . He was bending down to unlock the suitcase and get his electric razor when the girl came out of the bathroom . " Roy . I do n't feel very good . " She was dressed as she had been when he had put her to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else . But her face was gray , her eyes unfocusing and frightened , her voice pleading . She seemed like a child who had been hurt and did n't know by whom or why . " Something  --  something  --  is happening to me . " She began to shudder and sway . " Goddamned pills , " Spencer swore as he rushed to her . The girl crumpled to the floor before he could get there .  | Fighting back panic , Spencer knelt beside her , lifted her head , and spoke her name . " Bernadette ? " First softly , then shouting . " Bernadette ! " The girl 's eyes rolled crazily in a young face grown slack and uncomprehending . He slapped her , tentatively , across the cheek . Her eyes almost caught and held , then lost their focus again . In confusion and anguish , he slapped her harder . A blush appeared on her cheek where his hand had struck . Her eyes found him again . A look of astonishment . He thought he had her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again . The heel of his hand caught the side of her nose . Blood began to trickle from her left nostril . Her eyes focused and fixed him with a look of utter terror . " What are you doing to me ? " she moaned . Before he could answer , her head fell back , limp . He struck her again . But there was no response . He shifted around , fitted his hands under her shoulders , and dragged her into the bathroom , into the shower stall . He turned the cold-water tap on full force and held her there . He held her under the chilling spray until he could support her dead weight no longer . Then , panting from exertion , beginning to panic , he sat her down , propped in a corner of the stall . He turned off the water and , kneeling on the wet tile , he felt for her pulse . He could feel nothing . He let her wrist drop and pressed his ear to her chest . He could hear no heartbeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breast . There was no sound . He remembered a scene he had once played : a prison-camp escape . A soldier unconscious from electrical shock . The script had called for him to pound the man 's chest in an effort to restore a heartbeat . He struck out at the girl 's chest with his fist . Once . Twice . Three times . He pressed his ear close again . A faint , thready beat had begun . He laid the girl down on her back in the shower stall , placed his mouth over hers , and began blowing air down her  | windpipe . He worked over her this way until he became lightheaded from the effort , but as far as he could tell , the girl was not returning the breath . He listened again for her heartbeat . It was gone . He balled his fist up and struck out in a frenzy at her chest again . And again he listened . If there was a heartbeat , he could n't hear it for the pounding of his own pulse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his soaking clothes , his wet hair falling about his eyes , the taste of salt on his lips . And he realized he was crying  --  had been crying , blubbering , for he did n't know how long . He looked down at the battered girl , with her torn jersey , bloodied nose , bruised breasts . She looked like the victim of some madman . " Oh , God ! " Spencer groaned . Reaching up , he tore the heavy silk shower curtain from its runner and let it fall across the girl , to hide her . And then he fled in blind panic , his mind , short-circuited by shock , blotting out the memory of the awful heap of flesh and fabric he had left behind . Coatless , tieless , his soggy clothes clinging , he fled down the stairs into the silent lobby , past the dumbfounded night clerk and the sleepy bellman . Before they could question him , or stop him , or offer him their assistance , he passed into the street . He ran until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbling , gasping for breath in the Paris dawn , down the Rue de Rivoli , across the forecourt of the Louvre , down along the quays that lined the bank of the Seine . He did n't know where he was going or what he was fleeing . He was functioning on instinct alone . And his instinct was carrying him away from a nightmare . TWENTY-SIX EMBOA 'S LITTLE white Fiat followed the flow of traffic with apparent aimlessness through the streets of Rome . Emboa and Hollister sat almost shoulder to shoulder in the narrow back seat  | behind the driver . Emboa was toying with a slender filter-tip cigarette . He had taken it from his gold case a few moments before , but had n't bothered to put it to his lips and light it . He was just rolling it lightly back and forth between his thumb and index finger , pensively , the way a cigar lover might roll and consider a fine Havana . And he was , by either accident or design , adding measurably to Hollister 's anguish . By prearrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon in front of Doney 's , on the Via Veneto . And now , ten minutes later , Hollister was sweating  --  sweating profusely and smelling up the inside of the tight little car . It was a bad thing for a salesman to be doing while making the biggest pitch of his life . " ? certainly no question of bad intent  --  just too many problems  --  no way to account for them  --  just all at once  --  all at the same time ? " His back was wet and his throat dry . " ? but  --  it 's no lost cause  --  just a little more time  --  my man in Paris . Sanchon  --  a very good man . I 'd be there myself  --  right now  --  except for our appointment . But we 'll find the girl  --  no sweat . Just a little time . The box  --  it can be in your hands . In your hands ? before the week is out . Before the week is out . No question about it . Maybe  --  maybe sooner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweat out of the corners of his eyes . He watched Emboa rolling that damned cigarette between his fingers . " You have nothing to lose by delaying just a few more days , do n't you see ? " He could hear his voice coming out strained and pleading . A loser 's voice . Emboa sighed . " Regrettably , we are not even certain that the box was taken . There has been no report of such a theft in the news dispatches from New York . " " A cover-up . Do n't you see ? It 's a cover-up . They 're suppressing the story . Do n't you see ? You have my word ? " " I 'm afraid , " Emboa cut in sharply , " that your word is all we have . We certainly do not have the plutonium . " Emboa looked  | aggrieved . He snapped an order to the driver in Cinobarese and then turned his face to the window . Hollister slipped his hand inside his jacket , feeling for the safety catch on the Beretta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to reconsider , there was only one thing left to do . He did not deceive himself that killing Emboa might save his family . It would not even make things balance out , for how could he weigh Emboa 's life against theirs ? It was just something he would have to do . It was the least thing that any man would do . Emboa saw the movement out of the corner of his eye . " Are you looking for a cigarette , Mr. Hollister ? " Hollister 's finger found the trigger guard . " I have my own somewhere here , thanks . " " How rude of me , toying with a cigarette for so long and not offering you one . I insist that you try one of these . I have them specially blended . " Hollister 's hand relaxed inside his coat . Emboa was making a move toward conciliation . The ball game was n't over yet . " A very rare blend , " Emboa intoned . " Even unlit , the aroma is delightful . " He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Hollister heard the faint crunching sound as Emboa 's fingers pinched the sides of the cigarette . A stinging mist penetrated his nostrils , causing him to gasp . His fingers tightened around the pistol and drew it , or so he intended . But he was sickeningly aware that his hand would not move ; that , in fact , he did n't know for certain anymore where his hand was . He rolled his eyes slowly down , searching for his hand , and found it , still inside his coat , hung up by the forearm on the middle button as if broken and in a sling . By no effort of will could he move it . Nor could he move any of his extremities . His other hand lay limply , palm up , in his lap . He sat , slack-jawed , like the victim of a stroke , able to see and hear , but unable to move any voluntary muscle in his body .  | Emboa smiled benignly . " Fluoromethylcyanogen . FX3 . Nerve gas . I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most effective , would you not say ? But of course , I 'm afraid you can say nothing , can you ? " He unbuttoned the middle button on Hollister 's jacket . The hand inside that had been reaching for the gun , unsupported now , fell into Hollister 's lap . Emboa reached under the jacket , removed the Beretta , and pocketed it . The little Fiat followed traffic around the busy Piazza Venezia , circling the colossal marble wedding cake that was Victor Emmanuel 's monument . The driver then veered south on a heading toward the Porta San Sebastiano and the Appian Way . Emboa took a cigarette from his case and lit it , inhaling deeply of the smoke . " In a few minutes , " he explained , " the drug will begin to affect the involuntary muscles , and then it will be farewell , Mr. Hollister . I will comfort you with this thought , concerning your efforts in behalf of your family . . . " He paused a moment to draw on his cigarette again . Hollister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emboa exhaled the smoke . " Had you succeeded in delivering the plutonium , their fate would , of necessity , have been the same . You must understand that it really is impractical to attempt to hold two human beings under house arrest , so to speak , for a protracted period of time . Your wife and your daughter were liquidated ten days ago . The girl had made several attempts to escape and to attract attention . I had no choice but to issue the instructions . " In Hollister 's mind , his hands were about Emboa 's throat , strangling , crushing , squeezing the last ounce of life from him . But only in his mind . His body remained immobile . A low , animal moan escaped his lips . The driver eased the Fiat to a stop on the far side of the Porta San Sebastiano . Emboa opened his door and stepped out . He dropped his cigarette onto the road and carefully ground it out with the flawlessly shined tip of his shoe . Then he leaned in through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | more . He should be ready for disposal by then . " He turned a bitter glance at the body slumped in the back seat . " I do n't think he even attempted to keep his part of the bargain . I think he believed he could deal double with us from the very start and profit from our loss . Well , he underestimated us . But we have lost all the same . " Emboa stepped away from the car and began walking back into the city . The driver shifted into gear and the Fiat cruised out over the old Appian Way , bearing the slack , dumb figure of Nick Hollister past the ruined tombs of ancient Roman noblemen and their ladies . Back in his office , Emboa leafed morosely through the morning papers from the capitals of Europe , trying to delay as long as he could the sending of the message back to Masabara . He had done everything within his power to ensure the success of the mission . But he knew that he would be held responsible for its failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had chosen the wrong man in Hollister . But they would never acknowledge that . Blame would have to be fixed . And he feared it would be fixed on him . And the price of failure in an enterprise of this magnitude could be high . It could cost him his post in Rome , return him to the dreary nothingness of Masabara . It could cost him his life . He was considering the alternatives open to him , flight among them , when a headline in the lower left-hand corner of the Paris paper caught his eye : AMERICAN GIRL ABDUCTED . The news story told how Bernadette Finletter had vanished during the Paris stopover of a Rome-bound flight from New York . " ? the girl had spent a considerable part of the flight in the company of former motion picture idol Roy Spencer . It was with Spencer that she was seen leaving the plane . It is believed that the girl is under age and that Mr. Spencer will face morals charges when the couple is found ? "  | So Hollister had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given a little more time , Hollister might have made delivery . Now Emboa would have to do it himself  --  use his own people , with all the risks that entailed . It was his only chance . There would be no time to arrange for intermediaries . If the plutonium was still at large , in the possession of the fugitive actor and the girl , it would not remain so for long . He tore the news item out of the paper , called his secretary , asked her to send Rosabi in immediately upon his return with the Fiat , and instructed her to book seats on the earliest flight to Paris . TWENTY-SEVEN ROY SPENCER found himself sitting on a bench in the dappled shade of a chestnut tree . He was in the Place St.-Sulpice . He knew the square . He knew the massive church facing on one side of it . He had come here many times before , on his first trips to Paris , when he was young . His legs ached , in the calves and in the thighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of papier-mache . He had no recollection of how he had arrived here , or for how long he had been sitting here . Most puzzling of all , he wondered what he was doing in Paris . He had a picture to make in Rome . He looked at his wrist watch . Three-twenty-five . So he knew the time . But he was n't at all sure what day it was . He became aware of his clothes . No jacket . No tie . Shirt and trousers wrinkled as if they had been washed and wrung dry without pressing . A tide of fear washed through him . A sudden effusion of sweat burst from his pores , under his arms , down his spine , across his forehead . He remembered the girl on the plane . She had won a prize , she had said . A trip to Rome . They had gotten off the plane together in Paris . They had gone to a hotel .  | They had drunk champagne together . But there was more to it than that  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugged . The girl had taken his money and turned him out to wander the streets , mind blown , until now , when he found himself in the Place St.-Sulpice . He felt his hip pocket and was surprised to find his wallet there . He took the wallet out and counted his money . Give or take a few francs , it was all there . His traveler 's checks ? But they would be in his jacket pocket , as would his passport . And he was without his jacket . What had happened to his jacket ? He felt weak , exhausted . The roof of his mouth was dry . He would have to call Arnie in New York . Arnie would know what to do . There was a small cafe across the square , an undistinguished establishment without a name , identified only by the words BARTABAC on the awning . He dragged himself to his feet and shuffled , stoop-shouldered , like an old , old man across the square to the cafe . He sat down at a table outside and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bit hungrily into the croissants . He devoured them quickly , greedily , like a man who had been starving . Then he mixed the bitter black coffee half and half with boiled milk . He had trouble pouring because of the way his hands were trembling . He dropped three cubes of sugar into the coffee , stirred it once , and without waiting for the sugar to fully dissolve , gulped down half a cupful . Then he ordered more croissants . His appearance and his behavior so concerned the waitress that she asked to be paid first . He broke open the croissants in the second order and spread them thickly with butter . He ate more slowly now , munching on the pastry and sipping the coffee , and staring blankly out across the square , trying to recall the events that had brought him here . A student , dressed like a cowboy in a buckskin jacket and blue jeans , came across the square carrying copies of the International Herald Tribune for sale . Spencer bought one . He unfolded his paper and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front page : a photo out of the  | newspaper morgue , one of the last of the studio publicity portraits taken of him ten years ago . The headlines read , POLICE SEEK MOVIE STAR AND GIRL . Stomach churning , he read the story . It was n't true . It had n't happened that way at all . He had not lured her off the plane . She had attached herself to him . They had gone to a hotel ? but . . . With growing horror the events , all the events , began to fall into place in his mind . He had left the girl  --  in the hotel room  --  dead ? He was in serious trouble . He needed help . Numbly he left the table , went into the cafe , bought a jeton for the phone , and dialed the American Embassy . They came for him twenty minutes later , in an unmarked Citroen . They had asked him not to try to go to the Embassy by his own means but to wait , inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be seen in the streets . When the car pulled up , a man who identified himself as Garrett , a security attache , came into the cafe and hustled Spencer out . They got into the back seat of the Citroen together , the driver neither turning his head nor acknowledging their presence . But as soon as the doors had closed , without instructions , he started the car moving through the tortuous streets of the Left Bank toward the Seine . Inside the car , Garrett returned Spencer 's passport and his traveler 's checks . But he declined to say how they had come into his possession . In fact , he would answer none of Spencer 's questions , assuring him only that everything would be clarified at the right time . " All I want to know , " Spencer finally pleaded , " is what kind of trouble I 'm in ! " " That all depends , " Garrett replied enigmatically " I did n't hurt the girl . I know how it looked , but I did n't hurt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody has yet claimed that you hurt anyone . The newspaper  | did n't say anything about a girl being hurt , did it ? Just try to keep cool . " " Oh , God ! " Spencer groaned . " You do n't know the half of it . The girl is dead . " " I suggest you save yourself a lot of grief . Just wait until we get there . " Spencer sat hunched forward , like a man with a bad stomachache , wringing his hands . He had faced and overcome a score of crises in stories fabricated by other men , but he was totally unequipped to deal with the pulverizing brutality of real life . It hurt too much . He had reached his maturity in a world where tears were made of glycerin . " Can I call my agent in New York when we get to the Em-bassy ? " " I do n't know , " Garrett answered . " We 're not going to the Embassy straight off . " Spencer looked at him with new alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Rivoli , turned left up a side street , and stopped in front of the service entrance of the Hotel Meurice . Spencer moved like a robot as Garrett took him by the arm and guided him through the service door and up to the room he had occupied the night before . The door to the room was opened by a gnomelike man with a pink , hairless head so large that it dwarfed the rest of his body . The big-headed man stepped aside . Spencer , prodded by Garrett , took one step in and froze . His suitcase was where he had left it , on the rack at the foot of the bed . But her suitcases were in the room too , on the floor . The bathroom door was open . " It 's all right , " said the man with the big head . " She is n't here anymore . " Spencer did n't really walk into the room . Garrett passed him in and then , having made his delivery , closed the door and remained outside in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer , " said the man with the big head . He extended a strong , stubby-fingered hand . " I grew up  | on your pictures . " He spoke with a lazy Southern drawl and had a kindly manner . " Thank you , " said Spencer . His voice came out thin and high . The two other people in the room , standing together near the window , troubled him . It was n't the man so much . He was rather nondescript  --  clerkish , fortyish , carefully combed thinning hair , conservative suit of European cut . But the girl was disturbing . She was almost the same age , height , and coloring as Bernadette . She was even wearing the same kind of clothes . The man with the big head did n't bother to introduce or identify them , but continued talking to Spencer . " I suppose if it were n't for you I would n't be here today . " Spencer looked at him warily . The man held up his hand placatingly . " I do n't mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I sat through so many of your cloak-and-dagger movies that when I came out of college I joined the Service . Found it something of a letdown , to tell you the honest truth . Not anything like the flicks . Mostly a lot of ass-wearying desk work . " Spencer smiled uneasily . The friendly approach bothered him . It sounded too much like a scene from Undercover Man . Chumminess to put him off his guard . A girl , who could be a double for the victim , standing by accusingly to break him down . " But then , of course , " the big head went on , " I never did get to be a real agent . I 'm not the type who can get lost in a crowd real easy . " He smiled and patted the top of his head . " By the way , the name 's Bishop . Arthur Bishop . " Spencer nodded . Bishop turned to the other people in the room . " And that 's Miss Sheri Walker , and Monsieur Georges LaRose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we better quit gabbing and get down to business . Would you have a seat , Mr. Spencer ? " Spencer 's heart was pounding so hard that he was afraid he would shake himself to pieces if constrained by a chair . " Look , Mr. Bishop ? " He could hear the nervous vibrato in his voice and he fought to control it . " I do n't know what that story in the newspaper was all about , or why the man from the  | Embassy brought me to this room . I called them for help ... He stood trembling in the center of the room . And then he did sit down . He felt he would fall down if he remained standing . " I did n't run off with that girl . And I certainly did n't kill her . " He pressed his hands together to keep them from shaking . " Georges , would you be so kind as to call Room Service and order us a bottle and some ice ? I thing we could all do with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I panicked . I ran . Maybe I should n't have . I did n't know what I was doing . My mind was blank for half the day . But I swear to you I did not harm that girl . I know how she must have looked . But it was all from trying to save her . " " And well you might have , Mr. Spencer . Well you might have . " Bishop 's voice and demeanor were friendly to the point of being unctuous . " It was all those damned pills . God ! " " We knew it must have been when we pumped her stomach out . " " I should n't have run like that . . . " Spencer began to sob . Bishop put a comforting hand on Spencer 's shoulder . " Well , perhaps she will have benefited from the experience . " The meaning of Bishop 's words began to penetrate Spencer 's consciousness . He looked up , bewildered . " Yes , Mr. Spencer . I am telling you that Miss Finletter is alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They felt it advisable to check the room after observing you running through the lobby . They too thought she was dead . But fortunately , the police emergency squad is very good with this kind of thing . The pulse was all but gone , and the breathing too . But there was enough to work with . " Spencer sagged in the chair , totally drained and boundlessly grateful . " She is a very lucky girl , Mr. Spencer . In a way , so are we all . " " Is it possible for me to see her ? " Spencer asked . His voice sounded small and weak and far away .  | " I 'm afraid she must remain in isolation for a while . But I assure you she is being well cared for . " " It 's just that . . . when I was trying to bring her around . I hit her . And she looked up at me once as if . . . well , I want her to know that I was not trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tremble again and could speak no more . Bishop turned to LaRose and asked him to call Room Service again and tell them to hurry with the liquor order . TWENTY-EIGHT BISHOP SAT on the arm of a chair across from Spencer and watched him finish his second glass of brandy . The color had returned to his cheeks , and his hand had lost its tremor . Bishop opened a package of cigarettes ; offered one to Spencer , who declined ; lit one for himself ; and crossed to a table to pick up an ashtray . He returned to the arm of the chair and rested the ashtray on his thigh . " You know , Mr. Spencer , " he said casually , " something puzzled me about this room when we first came in . And it still does . You can put it down merely to a congenital preoccupation with details . But we noticed , aside from the bed having been slept in , that it looked like nothing was unpacked out of your suitcase last night . Can that be true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep in the clothes she arrived in . At least , in part of them . I opened my bag this morning to find my razor , but I did n't have time to take it out . " " And the girl did n't unpack either ? " " Well  --  I do n't know  --  her stuff was in the other room ? " " We brought her bags in here this morning , " Bishop explained . " Well  --  I do n't see how she could have unpacked . She came in here just a couple of seconds after the bellboy left . What 's this all about unpacking ? "  | " Well , you see , Mr. Spencer , we went through her baggage this morning . Yours too , of course . Perfectly normal procedure . And we found , inside one of her bags , another bag : an attache case , to be exact . But a very special attache case . Made of special materials . " Bishop swung his feet thoughtfully . He was sitting on the arm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And this attache case , we know , is packed with tubes of plutonium . " " Plutonium ? " Spencer could n't quite categorize it in his mind . " That 's the stuff nuclear bombs are made of , Mr. Spencer . It was stolen from an A.E.C. shipment at Kennedy Airport . " " You think she stole it ? " Spencer asked incredulously . Bishop shook his head . " We do n't know who stole it , or why . And that 's what we have to find out . We live in a state of delicate balance in this world of ours . Very finely tuned . East  --  West ? everything is just about even . The organism functions . You start letting nuclear materials get out of hand , or into the wrong hands , it 's like your girl with her pills . Everything collapses . You wreck the organization . " That plutonium was stolen yesterday morning . We have got to know who in this world , which country , has got an appetite for that kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Russians have their own . They do n't need to steal it from us any more than we would need to steal it from them . " " Then who ? " " That 's what we 're here to find out . " " You would think , " said Spencer bitterly , " that the newspaper would have been full of the robbery instead of that made-up story about me and the girl . " " Maybe so . Except that we clamped down on the robbery story , in the interest of national security , and we planted the one about you . " Well , you people may have just about scuttled what was left of my career ! " Spencer shouted in anguish . He started to get up and felt the room tilting . Too much emotion on top of too  | much brandy . He sat back down . " She told me she was over twenty-one . " Bishop looked aggrieved . " I am sorry , Mr. Spencer . We say she is n't . You must understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know who wants these nuclear materials . " " I want a retraction , " Spencer replied stridently . " I want a retraction or I 'm going to call my people in New York and ask them to sue . You have my word , I 'm going to raise the biggest stink you ever heard of . " Spencer sat back in the chair and crossed one leg over the other , trying to back up his ultimatum with a stance of rocklike assurance . But his breathing was heavy and his leg was trembling . Bishop was unruffled , and his tone was as soothing as warmed honey . " I doubt that that kind of action would help your career any , Mr. Spencer . But I know something that will . Would you hear me out ? You would be performing a service not only in your own interest but , for what it 's worth , in the interest of your country . " Spencer asked if he might have another brandy and then thought better of it . Instead he took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . " You have no way of being aware of this , Mr. Spencer , but we have reason to believe that it was you and not the girl who was supposed to have carried the plutonium . " He caught Spencer 's look of alarm and held up a hand . " We are not implicating you in any way , or the girl . It 's apparent that you have both been used , quite without your knowledge , in this affair . Otherwise the plutonium would n't still be sitting there . " He nodded toward the girl 's suitcase on the floor . " But we have word from New York that a bag was found in an airport locker this morning containing fragments of the wooden box that enclosed the case of plutonium . The description of that bag would make it an exact duplicate of yours , even to the tag on the handle with your name and address on it . "  | Spencer swallowed down the fragment of sandwich he had been working over and over in his mouth . Bishop went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to believe that you were meant to have been the carrier . But there was a foul-up somewhere . The material went into the girl 's bag . And the girl did n't go to Rome as she was supposed to . And so we have the plutonium , thank God , and they do n't . But they do n't know we have it . So what we must do now is give them a chance to lay hands on it again . And for that , " Bishop added apologetically , " we need your help . " Spencer looked up , dismayed . " Why me ? " " Because your face is known . Your presence will serve as something of a beacon as to the exact whereabouts of the property . Miss Walker here can substitute for Miss Finletter . Her appearance is something of an unknown quantity . But no one can substitute for you . " " That , " said Spencer glumly , " is the nicest damned thing anyone has said to me in years . " " All we ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Finletter left off last night , at least according to the newspaper story . You simply check out of the hotel and pile your luggage into the back seat of the yellow Renault convertible outside . License number 359-777-650 . It 's yours . At least , it 's rented in your name . Then you and Miss Walker simply have a pleasant few days ' drive , on a prescribed route , towards Rome ? " " Hold on ! " Spencer interrupted . " Now , hold on just a minute . " Bishop 's voice and manner had been almost hypnotic . He had made it all sound so easy that it was only by a real effort of will that Spencer was able to keep himself from being swept along . " You 're assuming an awful lot of things . Like that I 'm going to be in that car on the way to Rome . " Bishop spread his hands . " You have to go to Rome anyway . " " Not that way . Not as a moving target . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just let me finish , you 'd see .... " Uh-uh ! You may be the smoothest spellbinder since Cecil  | B. DeMille . But I 'm not the man you used to see up there on the silver screen ; I never was . Pretending is my business . I 'm real good at it , too . But I do n't mind telling you , Mr. Bishop , I go to pieces under pressure . " " Miss Walker and Monsieur LaRose have been trained not to go to pieces . She 'll be with you . He 'll be following behind . We are n't looking for heroics , Mr. Spencer . Quite the contrary . All we want is for you to be robbed of your luggage  --  or rather , Miss Finletter 's luggage . " " Simple as that ! " Spencer snapped irritably . Bishop nodded . " You will be following a predetermined itinerary , mile by mile . Not only will we know your every move , but we will report it to the press . . . in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will discover just too late that you and your paramour had stayed the night here at the Hotel Meurice and that you were seen departing in a yellow Renault convertible , license number 359-777-650 . " Later in the day it will be reported that your car was seen on the road to Dijon . You will , in fact , spend the night in Dijon . In the morning , if your baggage is still intact , Geneva will be your destination . And it will be reported in the papers that you slipped through the police net in Dijon and were seen traveling in the direction of Geneva . " " What if neither our baggage nor we are intact in the morning ? " " The danger of anything like that is minimal , judging from the way these people have worked so far . They operate with the greatest economy . Their objective is to go about their business with as little fuss and bother as possible . Violence only attracts attention . They do n't want attention . To be noticed is the last thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be following you is not so much that we feel you will need protection , but so that he will be in a position to keep our thieves under surveillance  | until they reach their delivery point . We want to know in whose behalf they 've been acting . Then we 'll move in . " Spencer shook his head . " I have a movie to make . " Bishop sighed . " In that case I wish you luck . I only hope that when you get to Rome you find you still have a contract . " Bishop looked guileless enough to kill . " They still do have those morality clauses , do n't they ? " Spencer knew they had him by the short hairs . But he was n't yelling " foul . " He managed to glare at Bishop . But the anger in his eyes was manufactured , to give him time to think . The truth was , he felt drawn to the challenge they were offering him ; yet without their compelling bit of blackmail , it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For the first time in his adult life he was being asked , coerced really , to engage in something more than pretense . He was being prodded into a contest with reality . And it was important : not so much for any of Bishop 's missionary reasons , but for his own selfesteem . In recent years , especially since his star had set , he had begun to question the validity of his manhood . Now , if he could bring himself to accept a rather elementary mission  --  one that he could , without question , come through  --  he would prove something of immense value to himself . " Of course , " Bishop was saying , " should you finally decide to help us identify our bandits , there 'd be no reason why the true story of what happened could n't be told . We would be happy to release that story , which would include the part you played in it . Then , when you got to Rome , you would be able to start your picture , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on a new shine . " Spencer allowed himself just a drop of brandy at the bottom of his glass . He crossed to the tall windows and stood looking out over the exquisite gardens of the Tuileries , hazy with the heat of late afternoon . He stood there thoughtfully , making lazy horizontal circles with the hand holding the brandy glass . The  | risk really was small . Half the people in the world had been robbed at one time or another . They just had n't known beforehand that they would be . And there was something so important to be gained  --  more important than the good press he would receive when it was all over , and the new luster that would surround his existence : he would prove to himself that he was more than just a celluloid man . Bishop and LaRose watched from the hotel room window as Spencer and Sheri arranged their luggage in the back seat of the car . " There 's no point trying to follow them through the city , " Bishop said . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up on Number Five heading south . You might even let Spencer have a look at you once or twice . He 's not the strongest character in the world . I do n't want him to begin fretting about being abandoned . " " What if there should be a direct confrontation with the other side ? " " He 'll be a liability . But right now , we need him . So let 's do what we can to keep him thinking the trip is going to be a lark . Maybe it will be . If they go for the bait at all , I doubt they 'll be so clumsy as to try to take it by force . " Down below in the street , Spencer helped Sheri Walker into the car ; then he crossed around to the driver 's side and got in behind the wheel . " Time for you to be on your way , " Bishop said . LaRose nodded and started for the door . Halfway across the room , he stopped . " Satisfy my curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that story about the Finletter girl ? " Bishop shrugged . " I felt it was necessary . You saw how he looked when he walked into the room . I think he would have been too shaken up to function for us if he knew she had died . " LaRose considered that a moment . " I suppose you 're right , " he said . Then he turned and left the room .  | TWENTY-NINE THE ROAD out of Paris was flat and straight . Once they had passed through the narrow industrial belt that girdles the city , the smell of factory waste gave way to the aroma of earth and grass and freshly turned soil . Outward appearances aside , Sheri Walker was a very different girl from the real Bernadette . There was an air of easy competence about her , a cool efficiency and sureness in everything she did . She could n't have been more than a few years older than the real Bernadette , still young enough to be Spencer 's daughter , but she was very much in command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt about their exact position on the map in relationship to the countryside . There was no branch in the highway for which she was unprepared , no crossroads ahead went unexamined for signs of danger , no traffic behind escaped her scrutiny for indications that they had been tagged by the other side . Her training and her instincts allowed her to do no less , even though she was certain that it was far too early for anyone to have picked up their trail . Her eyes monitored Spencer too  --  partly because it was her job to do so , partly because she was a woman ; there radiated from him such an appealing aura of vulnerability and youth . He was at least as old as her father , and yet he seemed to be her junior . His insecurity and confusion in this frightening and unfamiliar milieu only served to enhance his appeal . She could understand why he had been an idol in her parents ' time . She could understand why the poor Finletter girl had attached herself to him . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with Bernadette , compulsively , as a child relates the incidents in a nightmare , hoping the terror of it will evaporate with the outflowing words . " Thank God she 's all right , " he had muttered at one point . And Sheri Walker , trained to detachment , had been so  | moved by his transparent display of emotion that she had placed a hand lightly over his hand for a moment on the steering wheel , hoping to assure him by her touch that she understood his distress and that there was no need to be concerned anymore . Bishop had been right , she thought , to tell Spencer that the girl had lived . They stopped once , for fuel and refreshment and that was the first time Spencer actually saw LaRose 's car . LaRose drove by them without a nod of acknowledgement . Then he stopped , farther down the road . They passed LaRose again when they resumed their journey . His car was pulled up on the shoulder with the hood up , and he was bent over as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car again all the rest of the way to Dijon . The Hotel de la Colombe in Dijon was a large , musty relic of the nineteenth century , with mottled walls , heavy worn carpeting , and floors that sagged with each footfall . They left their car parked conspicuously in front of the hotel . A simianlike bellboy , stoop-shouldered and long of arm from decades of carrying other people 's bags and wheezy as the institution he served , brought in their luggage . They followed him into the creaky birdcage of an elevator and up to a room on the second floor . The room had once been part of a suite , but was now separated from the adjoining room by a locked paneled door . The bellboy departed with his tip , and Miss Walker closeted herself in the bathroom . Spencer went to the window , pushed it open , and stepped out onto the narrow railed ledge that passed for a balcony . Their room , specifically reserved by Bishop in Paris , looked out onto an enclosed courtyard  --  presumably to afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter that way rather than by the front door . A sound , abrasive as a dentist 's drill boring into enamel , brought Spencer back into the room in time to see a tiny steel shaft erupt in a fine spray of wood dust through the paneling of the connecting door .  | Spencer watched , frozen , as the bit was withdrawn and a minute glass disk , smaller than a shirt button , filled the hole . " If you please , Mr. Spencer , " instructed a voice in heavily accented English , " walk to the front door of your room and then back to the window . " It was LaRose . Spencer did as he was told and then returned to face the connecting door . " Excellent , " said LaRose , opening the door . He stepped through into Spencer 's room and proceeded to paste a square of walnut-stained gauze over the button of glass . He surveyed his work with satisfaction . The hole and the glass , even in good light , had all but vanished . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A wide-angle lens . I put my eye to the tube on the other side of the door and I can observe every movement in your room . " He winked . " It would have been less than gallant of me not to warn you and the lady of this . " The lock on the bathroom clicked , and Miss Walker came back into the room , stopping short when she saw LaRose . " What 's wrong ? " she asked apprehensively . " Not a thing , " said Spencer . " Monsieur LaRose here just wanted to warn us that he had installed a peephole in the door . " " Good ! " said Miss Walker . " Let 's go out to dinner . I 'm starved . " She crossed to the bed , picked up her jacket , draped it capelike around her shoulders , and started for the door . " What about the bags ? " Spencer asked . " That 's Georges 's business . Ours is to make ourselves visible . " She came back and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy corrupting my morals , are n't you ? So let 's begin with the sin of gluttony . Uncle Sam is picking up the tab . " " Twenty-five kilometers on the road to Beaune , " LaRose advised . " The Fleur . Charming , and exquisite cuisine . I envy you. , , " Can we bring something back for you , Georges ? " Sheri asked . " There should be no more contact between us . I 'll have food  | sent up from downstairs , thank you . " LaRose withdrew to his room and made a little bow . " I will see you tomorrow evening in Geneva , unless our fish bite tonight . " He closed the connecting door . THIRTY SPENCER BOUGHT a newspaper in the hotel lobby and scanned the latest story about them on the way out to the car . The item described their flight from Paris in a yellow Renault , and quoted a police official who had received reports that they were in the vicinity of Dijon . Inside the parked car , Spencer handed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it idle until she had finished reading . " How does it feel to see your name in the paper ? " he asked . " How would I know ? " Sheri Walker replied . " It 's not my name that 's in the paper , remember ? " Spencer released the brake and shifted into gear . They drove in silence through the coppery summer twilight , past the legendary vineyards of the Cote d'Or . Forty-five minutes later , a little way beyond the Clos de Vougeot , with its winepresses dating back to the Middle Ages , they found the restaurant . The interior of the old stone house was high and cool , with tables set on two levels . Spencer and Sheri were seated on an oak-railed balcony , perhaps a former hayloft , overlooking the restaurant 's main floor . The whitewashed walls were lined with plaques bearing the coats of arms of the venerable families of the region . Kerosene lanterns suspended from the beams cast their warm glow . They ate snails in a mouth-watering garlic sauce and sipped cool Chablis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked  --  and Sheri told him  --  how she had become a spy : simply by visiting the appropriate agency in Washington one summer ,  | after her sophomore year in college , and offering her services . Spencer did n't believe her . But she stuck to her story . They were served a heady boeuf a la bourguignonne , the specialty of the house , accompanied by a full bodied Clos de Vougeot from the vineyard they had passed on the road . And Spencer told the girl how he had become an actor  --  not , at first , motivated by a feeling for the arts , but by a natural inclination toward lechery . In his postpubescent fantasies , inspired by the movie magazines , he had imagined that as an actor he would have easy entree into the bedrooms of the most exotic women in the world . Sheri refused to believe him . But he insisted it was true . By the time dessert came around  --  spiced honey bread and rich cheese pastry  --  Spencer was well launched into his stories about Hollywood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthralled , absently munching delicate cassis-flavored jelly candies from a little pewter dish . Spencer was in his element , and he was superb . She could not have known how often he had told these same stories before . But Spencer knew , and it troubled him . For these stories were the sum total of his experience , and they had all happened eons ago . Nothing he had done since then was worth talking about . On the midnight drive back to Dijon , full of food and wine , and lulled by the purring of the car 's engine , the girl began to doze , her head resting on Spencer 's shoulder . She woke with a start when he braked the car to a stop in front of the hotel . " I must have fallen asleep , " she said , blinking her eyes . " I seem to have that effect on the ladies these days , " Spencer sighed . " You know , " she said , " I do n't really believe you are a lecher at all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness . " " A typical lecher 's ploy . Put the victim off her guard . " Spencer winked . " Oh , bosh ! I 've been off guard most of the evening . You  | do n't have the reflexes of a lecher . A lecher is very quick with his hands . " Spencer laughed . He got out of the car , walked around , and opened the door for Sheri . She took his hand as he helped her out of the car , and held onto it as they walked together across the pavement to the hotel , their footsteps echoing in the silent street . The man sitting in the Simca across the way watched them enter the hotel . As they disappeared into the lobby , he hurried from his car and followed them . A folded copy of the International Herald Tribune stuck out of the side pocket of his rumpled jacket . Inside the lobby , he crossed quickly to the main stairs , once a grand stairway , that spiraled around the open elevator shaft . He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below where the elevator creaked to a halt . He heard the elevator gate open and then crash shut . He listened as the footsteps of Spencer and Sheri receded down the hall . Then he moved quickly up the rest of the stairs and watched from around the corner of the elevator cage to see which room the couple would enter . Sheri motioned for Spencer to give her the key . She slipped it carefully into the lock and took great care to make it turn silently : The door swung open . " Why the second-story routine ? " Spencer asked in a whisper . The girl put her finger to her lips . " Do n't want to disturb LaRose . " In the next room , LaRose smiled to himself , but did n't bother to open his eyes . He had been dozing on the bed , with a pair of earphones on . Spencer 's voice and Sheri 's came through , thin and metallic , like the sound track of an old movie on television . There were sensors taped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sensors to a small tape recorder on LaRose 's bedside table , and from there to the earphones . There was the sound of a light switch clicking on . The girl 's voice , a sibilant whisper : " Everything looks the same  | as when we left . Let me just check the bags . " There was a sound of luggage snapping open . A moment 's pause . " The case is still there . " The sound of luggage snapping shut . Then , no sound at all . LaRose began to drop off again  --  and woke himself , alarmed . The sudden silence in the other room bothered him . There should have been more movement , more words , more indications of bedtime activity . LaRose reached across to the night table and turned the volume of his listening device up to maximum amplification . He could now detect sounds of breathing : abnormal , irregular , stopping for brief intervals and then rushing in quick gasps . La Rose abandoned his bed and moved apprehensively to the spy hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorting eye of the wide-angle lens revealed Roy Spencer and Sheri Walker embracing in the center of the room . Nonplussed , LaRose padded back to his bed , settled himself in , and decorously lowered the volume on the listening device until the sounds of their breathing and the moist meetings of their lips were tuned out . LaRose was troubled . He had worked with Sheri Walker on other assignments and had always found her to be a model of discipline and restraint . Could it be that he , LaRose , lacked something that Spencer had ? Or was Sheri simply implementing , in her own way , Bishop 's instructions to keep Spencer 's mind off the hazards of the mission ? LaRose decided in favor of the latter explanation . It left his ego intact . Spencer 's voice crackled in the earphone : " Do you want to dress first ? " Sheri 's voice : " But are n't you the gallant one . " Spencer 's : " I am a paragon of bedroom etiquette . I have been broken in by three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sleep in my clothes , thank you . " Spencer : " You 'll ruin them that way . " Sheri : " Better them than me . " LaRose rejoiced . Sheri was running true to form . His doubts  | about her , and consequently about himself , evaporated . Gleefully he returned to the spy hole to witness Spencer 's vanquishmentand was himself crushed by what he saw . He padded back to his lonely bed to consider the awesome duplicity of the female . For himself , and his tape recorder , Sheri 's dialogue indicated that she was deporting herself in her customary fashion . But even as she had announced her intent to sleep in her street clothes , she had been miming an invitation to the bewildered Spencer to help her remove them . LaRose smiled , his personal feelings of envy reduced to insignificance beside his professional admiration for the girl 's resourcefulness . In the interest of good sportsmanship he reached out to turn off the listening device entirely , when his ears were jolted by a sharp , hammering sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened . The hammering sound came again : someone rapping sharply on a door . It was n't the connecting door , but the front door to the other room . And now Spencer 's voice in the earphones was no longer a whisper , but wary : " Who 's there ? " A voice from the hallway on the other side of the door , subdued but threatening : " You better open up , Mr. Spencer . I know you 're inside . " LaRose flung off the earphones and sprang to his feet . He picked up his revolver and moved quickly to the connecting door . He stood with one hand on the knob , alert , listening . Spencer 's voice , to Sheri : " I sure as hell hope LaRose is awake in there now . " The sound of the lock clicking open on the hall door . Spencer 's voice , puzzled : " Well , I 'll be damned ? " Sound of a smack  --  a punch being landed . A gasp from Sheri . A body crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break into the room and subdue the intruder . He was under orders not to reveal himself , not to interfere with the theft . He was to allow the theft to take place , and follow the thief to his delivery point . Thank  | God the unexpected violence appeared to be at an end . After that first punch , and the gasp , there was silence . Spencer and Sheri would offer no further resistance . The thief would do his work and be gone . Looking through the spy hole , LaRose confirmed that Spencer and Sheri had come to no great harm , though Spencer was on the floor , half propped against an overturned chair . Not much damage . Just a punch to the face . Of course , the face that had been punched belonged to an actor . LaRose could n't see the intruder 's face . He was standing with his back to the spy hole . But he was saying something totally startling . " That 's not Bernadette , " the intruder hissed . " What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's voice , rose and cracked . And now LaRose realized what had happened . The wrong animal had strayed into their trap and sprung it . Spencer raised himself groggily up on one knee . " Where is she ? " the young man bellowed , and threw himself onto the actor , sending him sprawling , pinning him to the floor , throttling him . Now the girl moved , ramming her heel into the small of the intruder 's back , and using that as leverage , locking both hands under his chin and hauling back until his hands sprang free of Spencer 's throat . He flailed the air wildly with his fists , trying to reach Spencer 's face . LaRose burst into the room as the girl removed her foot from the small of the young man 's back just long enough to bring her leg up and send her heel smashing down into his kidney . The young man let out a cry of pain and rolled over onto the floor , writhing . Spencer disentangled himself from the overturned chair and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping for breath . LaRose stuck his pistol into his belt , knelt down , and locked a handcuff onto one of the young man 's wrists . He snapped the other cuff to the leg of the bed . He crossed to the door to the  | hallway and shut it . Then he closed the connecting door to his room . " There was a time , " Spencer gasped as he got painfully to his feet , " when I would have had a double for that kind of work . " He crossed to the mirror on the dresser and examined his face . His left ear was beet-red , and throbbing , where the young man 's first punch had landed . Otherwise his face was unmarked . He ran his tongue cross his teeth and satisfied himself that his caps had n't been knocked loose . " Well , the son of a bitch sure is stronger that he looks . But he is n't very accurate , thank God . " He turned to Sheri , who was leaning against the wall , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaRose stood over the intruder , who had painfully risen to one knee but could rise no higher since he was manacled to the leg of the bed . Head bowed , he looked like a piece of ancient statuary , a portrait of abject defeat . " It is correct if I guess that this is the young man who was on the plane ? " LaRose asked . Spencer nodded . He and Sheri and LaRose stood in a semicircle looking down at the pathetic young man . " What did you do with her , you bastards ? " young Paul Henderson cried in anguish . LaRose ignored the question and addressed himself to Spencer and the girl . " We can not afford to have him at liberty . At least , not until this is all over . " " I 'll see to it you 're punished for this if it 's the last thing I do , " the young man whined . LaRose took his pistol out of his belt and handed it to Sheri . " Would you be so kind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed through the connecting door into his room , picked up his necktie off the back of a chair , and began threading it through his collar . Spencer followed LaRose into the adjoining room . " What are you going to do with the kid ? " Spencer asked , concerned .  | " Take him to the local prefecture . They will detain him for a few days . " " On what kind of charge ? " LaRose shrugged and made the final adjustment on the knot of his tie . " Assault , if necessary . But really , no specific charge is necessary . This is France . " He slipped into his jacket and , followed by Spencer , crossed back into the room where Sheri was watching over Paul Henderson . After locking the connecting door , he took the pistol back from her , produced another key from his pocket , knelt down , and opened the handcuff that was locked around the leg of the bed . The young man struggled to his feet ; stood a moment , looking like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . LaRose leveled his pistol . Paul Henderson stopped . " Young man , " said LaRose " you are too impetuous , and we are going to have to limit your mobility for just a few days . But first I want to you to know who I am ... " " You are filth , " spat the young man . LaRose shrugged . " Have it your way . But since you are bent on making loud noises , and since what we are about to do must be done most discreetly , I am going to have Mr. Spencer gag your mouth . It will only be for a little while . " He took out his silk pocket handkerchief and handed it to Spencer . " If you will , Mr. Spencer . " Paul Henderson turned and spat at Spencer as he approached with the gag . LaRose raised his pistol as a reminder , and the young man made no more fuss as Spencer placed the handkerchief across his mouth . " Open wide , " LaRose commanded . The young man opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . Then he tied the knot at the back . He had the look of a man who would rather be doing almost anything else in the world . Paul Henderson growled in muffled protest as LaRose turned  | him around and snapped on the handcuffs so that his wrists were locked behind his back . " It will only be for a little while , " LaRose assured him again , as much for Spencer 's peace of mind as for Paul Henderson 's . But the look in the young man 's eyes reflected disbelief . " I recommend that you and Miss Walker get what sleep you can . The schedule calls for an early start on the road to Geneva . " LaRose checked the connecting door to make certain it was locked . Then he gestured with his pistol for the young man to precede him to the hall door . " I 'll try not be noisy when I return to my room , " he said to Spencer and Sheri . Then , so that the young man would see , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it there aimed at his prisoner 's midsection . " If you will behave yourself , " he said quietly , " no one will be hurt . Just walk ahead of me to the fire stairs at the far end of the corridor . But remember : walk , do n't run . " LaRose threw a wink at Spencer and Sheri as he took a firm grip on the young man 's arm and guided him out of the room . Spencer closed the door and went back to the mirror , where he reexamined his red and pulsing ear . " It would be just my luck to arrive on the set with a cauliflower ear . " " Would you like a cold towel ? " Sheri asked . " No . But you would n't have an aspirin , would you ? " " Hardly ever touch the stuff , " Sheri apologized . " It would figure , " said Spencer . " Last night I 'm with a walking pharmacy . Tonight , when I could really use a pill . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ahead of him past the elevator and the public stairway and around the far corner of the corridor toward the opposite side of the building , toward the dead end where a ruby sign over an unnumbered doorway advertised the fire exit . Still with a firm grip on the young man 's upper arm , LaRose  | opened the door and flicked the wall switch that turned on a dusty low-watt light bulb over the small landing halfway down the stairway . The stairway was narrow , hardly wider than the width of a man , with steep wooden steps , uncarpeted and uncared for , and paint-peeling walls . LaRose felt the young man recoil , and tightened the grip on his arm . " Let 's go . The management here is miserly . That light is timed to turn off in just one minute . " He pushed the young man ahead of him . As they passed through the doorway LaRose , still holding tight to his prisoner 's arm , half-turned and pulled the door shut behind him . The boy moved with startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He threw himself into a crouch and hurled his weight back at the agent , hitting him hard with his shoulder squarely in the abdomen . LaRose grunted in pain as the force of the blow knocked the wind out of him , causing him to double over and pitch forward across his captive 's shoulder , down the stairway . Clawing wildly for a handhold , his fingers found a purchase on the boy 's collar . They tumbled , one body over the other , locked together in bewilderment and pain , down the fourteen steps to the narrow landing . Halfway down , the young man screamed into his gag as LaRose 's body landed across his leg and tore his hip joint from its socket . LaRose made no sound at all  --  not even when they slammed into the wall of the landing that broke their fall . The young man , on his belly , his chin jutting across the lower flight of steps , could see down to the steel door that would exit onto the street fourteen more steps below . LaRose saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his neck snapped and grotesquely twisted . The young man tried to move and moaned in agony as his liberated hip joint punished the nerve endings inside his pelvis.  | He tried to move his manacled hands , immobilized behind his back by the weight of LaRose 's body , and collapsed in pain . The stairwell light winked out . And , in the darkness , there was only the sound of the young man sobbing into his gag as into a pillow . The merciless ticking of the alarm clock grew louder with the passage of each minute . Spencer and Sheri Walker lay sleepless in their separate beds . Paul Henderson 's intrusion had shattered their moment . Spencer shifted and burrowed . He could n't settle himself . He was too unnerved to sleep . Sheri could n't sleep either . Spencer 's gyrations were keeping her awake . And she was worried about his state of mind . Spencer had agreed to go along because Bishop had minimized the possibility of danger . Now , after the confrontation with the boy , Spencer might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rustle of linen . Spencer sat up . Sheri could see his silhouetted form , hunched over on the edge of the bed , his back to her , his feet on the floor . His angular shoulders rose and fell in a sigh . He shuddered , as if chilled . She slipped out from under her blanket . Spencer sensed movement behind him . He turned and saw Sheri , standing in the narrow space between the beds , softly illuminated by the light from outside that filtered through the slatted shutters . She was wearing the short blue slip she had worn to bed  --  bare-legged , bare-bodied underneath , her breasts free , her hips unbound . There was a look of concern on her face . " I 'm sorry , " Spencer apologized . " I did n't mean to wake you . Go on back to sleep . I 'll keep still . " He turned away again and stared gloomily at the dark wall . He felt his mattress give as Sheri knelt on the bed behind him . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knead the tense muscle between the top of his shoulder and the back of his neck . Her voice was soft and reassuring . " You must n't let  | what happened tonight upset you , " she said . " It was just a fluke . Bishop could n't have foreseen it . " He accepted her ministrations gratefully , still staring straight ahead . " It 's just that I 've never been hit before . " He sounded hurt and profoundly disturbed . " A hundred fake fights for the camera , and I never knew what it meant to be hit . " Sheri 's thumbs and fingertips , palms , and heels of hands worked expertly on . " It 's the contact that 's so bad , the numbness even more than the pain . And even worse than that . It 's knowing that someone really means to break you up . All those fight scenes , and I never really knew what it was all about . " He shuddered again . Sheri was moved by Spencer 's naivete . She felt ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her part in it , though she knew there was no other way . She pressed close to him , comfortingly , protectively . " You claim that Bishop had no way of foreseeing what happened tonight , " Spencer said , with concern . " Maybe something else might happen that he could n't have foreseen . " Sheri threaded her hands between his arms and his torso and reached across his chest , her fingers undoing the buttons on his pajama shirt , finding their way inside . Spencer turned within the circle of her arms , his hands gliding under her slip . She lifted her arms , allowing him to raise the slip over her head . He drew in his breath at the sight of her body . He reached out a hand and traced the contours of her breasts . Sheri took his face in her hands . Spencer winced . " That 's where he hit me , " he complained . She leaned down , placed her lips over his good ear , and whispered , " Shhhh . Let 's be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm clock went off , their blankets were on the floor and their nightclothes were scattered . They lay in the hollow of  | the mattress back to belly , with the girl 's bottom snuggled comfortably into Spencer 's lap , and his arm encircling her . Sheri 's eyes fluttered as she half-turned onto her back and stretched languorously . The alarm rang itself out while Spencer 's palm moved in small circles over her silken abdomen . She rolled sensuously right and left , and his palm found her breast , taut with expectation . His forefinger found the ridge of her swollen nipple and began to trace lazy circles around its base . " We have n't time , " she whispered , as her fingers featherbrushed his temples . But her face was flushed , and her lids were heavy , and her hips had begun to writhe . A droplet of saliva had formed at the corner of her mouth , and he kissed it . Her hand followed the outline of his body to his groin , and found him full and throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They made love greedily , silently , and it was all the more exquisite for this self-enforced silence , even in the explosive moment of release . They made love mutely , allowing only their bodies to express what they were feeling , for they were determined that LaRose , with his earphones in the next room , should not become privy to their secret . As they drove away from the hotel a thought occurred to Sheri , and she covered her mouth with her hand in dismay . " What did you forget ? " Spencer asked . " We both forgot , " the girl replied . " He has that damned wideangle peephole . " LaRose grinned into the darkness in the narrow stairway . Beneath the dead weight of his body , Paul Henderson twisted and squirmed in mind-blown agony , rubbing his gagged mouth against the rough edge of the stairstep below his chin as he had been doing between lapses into unconsciousness throughout the night and early morning . Now , at last , its strands macerated from  | abrasion and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mouth . He began to howl like a madman . THIRTY-ONE " Mr. Bishop has overlooked none of the media , " said Spencer as he reached past the steering wheel and snapped off the car radio . " Mr. Bishop overlooks very little , " Sheri replied . " He would have made a hell of a press agent , " said Spencer . It was noon , and the hourly newscaster had just finished reporting that the fugitive actor and the girl had been seen passing through the vicinity of Perouges on the road from Dijon . " You could almost tell time by us , we 're so on schedule , " Sheri announced , pointing to the crumbling stone ramparts looming on the hillside above them . " That looks like it must be Perouges . Let 's stop and stretch our legs . " " I do n't know about you , but I need to go to the head , " said Spencer . " That 's what I meant by stretching our legs , ' " said Sheri . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had been driving without letup for nearly three hours to make up for the time they had spent in bed . Spencer stopped the car on the shoulder of the road behind another parked car and a motor scooter . Their owners could be seen walking the ancient battlements at the top of the hill . " Do you suppose it 's all right to leave the car with the top down like this ? " Spencer asked . Sheri shrugged . " Why not ? The sooner we 're robbed the better . " They got out of the car and climbed the stony hillside hand in hand . From the craggy summit they could see the way they had come , and the way they would be going as the road threaded its way through the foothills of the Jura Mountains to the Swiss  | border . But nowhere among the venerable ruins of the town could they find the accommodations they were seeking . Except for a few sight-seers , Perouges was uninhabited , a museum piece left over from medieval times . Sheri pointed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southeast . " There must be people there , " she said hopefully . " And food . Let 's not waste any more time here . " " Since when is a place like this a waste of time ? " Spencer protested . " Since I 'm hungry , and have to go to the ladies ' room and since we still have a schedule to keep . " " You are a philistine . " " What 's that ? " " I do n't know exactly . But it 's some kind of barbarian . No culture . Unable to enjoy the relics of the past . " " I 'm no such thing , " Sheri replied impishly . " I 've enjoyed you immensely . " Spencer shot her a look of mock annoyance . " No soul . Just a big bundle of appetites . " He took her hand and began helping her down the hillside toward the car . A flash of sunlight reflecting off glass caught his eye as they scrambled down the slope . " That must be LaRose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was moving quickly around the lazy curves of the mountain road . " But that 's a different car . " Sheri looked puzzled . " He 's probably changed cars . We 're the ones who are supposed to be readily spotted , not him . " They lost sight of the swiftly oncoming car as the road led it behind a hillock in the middle distance , and then it came into view again  --  a dark green Peugeot 404 . It slowed suddenly as it came out of a curve in the road a quarter of a mile away and moved as cautiously as a stalking cat across the blacktop toward the parked Renault . Two of the tourists , youth-hostelers , who had been on the hilltop before Spencer and Sheri , were down near the road now climbing  | the low wall that separated them from their motor scooter . With a sudden lurch and a whine , engine components straining in low gear , the Peugeot leaped forward and sped past the parked vehicles and out of sight around the next curve . Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wall , and made their way to their car through a blue haze of gasoline fumes left behind by the departing motor scooter . Sheri leaned against the side of the Renault and began shaking pebbles out of her shoe . " What makes you so sure that was LaRose in that car ? " Spencer shrugged . " Why else would he have hightailed it after he checked us on the hillside ? " " Maybe it was the kids climbing the wall that spooked him . " " Maybe . So what ? " Sheri looked worried . " It was n't LaRose . " " What makes you so sure of that ? " " There were two men in that Peugeot . " " You saw two men in that car ? " " Did n't you ? " " From where we were standing ? " Spencer shook his head No . " Maybe you should get a pair of glasses , a man your age . " Sheri winked at him , put her shoe back on , and got into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ignition , and paused , thoughtful . " If that was n't LaRose , then who was it ? " Sheri looked at him , amused . " The first thing you have to guard against in this line of work is creeping paranoia . They were probably a couple of tourists who thought they might like to see the ruins on the hill , and then decided it was n't worth the climb . And LaRose is undoubtedly parked on a shoulder a couple of miles ahead or behind , cursing us for the delay . " Spencer smiled , relieved ; started up the engine ; and eased the car out onto the road . Had he not been busy driving , had he been able to study Sheri 's face , he would have seen her expression darken with concern .  | THIRTY-TWO IT TOOK Spencer and Sheri less than fifteen minutes to drive to the populated town they had seen from the hilltop at Perouges . At a table in the shade on a cafe terrace , Spencer ordered sandwiches and drinks . Sheri sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth finger , right hand and , surveying the sparse street traffic with anxious eyes . The interest in food she had evidenced in Perouges seemed to have vanished . When the order came , she gnawed without enthusiasm at a corner of her sandwich , a clublike loaf of French bread slit lengthwise and stuffed with wedges of ham and cheese . Finally , she asked the waiter-proprietor if there was a telephone inside , and excused herself from the table . Spencer sipped from a stein of Alsatian beer and speculated with growing concern about their situation until , when Sheri finally returned , he could no longer contain his anxiety . " You called Bishop , did n't you ? " he asked , almost accusingly . Sheri replied with a distracted nod and made another attempt on her sandwich . " Well , what did he say ? " " There 's nothing to worry about . " " Is that what he said , or is that what you 're telling me ? " " That 's the consensus . " " Then why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think you 're both more worried than you 're willing to let on. , , " You can think whatever you want to . " " What if his car broke down ? " " He 'd steal one . He 's very resourceful . In fact , maybe he did have to change cars . Maybe that 's why we have n't been able to spot him . " " That 's what I said back in Perouges . " " Well , maybe you were right . "  | " But you 're still worried ? " " I told you , no . " " Then how come you ca n't eat ? " " How can I eat when you 've got me answering all these ques-tions ? " They chewed halfheartedly on their sandwiches for a silent while . " You know , " said Spencer , " I 'm not obliged to go on with this . To hell with Bishop and his newspaper stories . The days of moral turpitude are over with anyway . " The girl lowered her sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating food that would n't go down . " What are you talking about ? " " Moral turpitude ! Old men running off with underage girls , like Bishop 's news stories say I did . Used to be the studio lawyers ' favorite excuse for breaking contracts . Some of my best friends vanished forever in that murky old sea of moral turpitude . But that 's all over now , right ? " " I would n't know . " " Of course you would n't . But take my word for it : the bigger the turpitude , the better the box office . I 've been living in the past . I was an ass to let Bishop 's blackmail move me at all . If I walked out on this right now , the bad press would probably do nothing but increase my asking price per picture . " " Then go ahead . What 's keeping you ? " Sheri was plainly upset . Spencer could n't answer . A confusion of feelings rendered him mute . Sheri Walker , sitting across from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have given the time of day to in his youth . But she was the reason he could n't walk out . If he told her this , he felt he would only have been admitting an embarrassing truth : that he was just another old man who had lost his head over a girl young enough to be his daughter . Sheri let him off the hook . " I think you 're going to stay because you know how important this is . It 's a question of duty . "  | Spencer laughed , released . " That 's the world 's worst reason for doing anything . " " You do n't really believe that . " " You bet I do . I 've been to the stars and back again , and I know that only the self-centered survive . The only trouble is I learned it too late . That 's why I do n't own my own production company now like a lot of other guys my age . That 's why I 'm spending my declining years chasing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that this one is going to make a difference . " " It really means that much to you ? " " You ca n't know if you have n't been there . Once you 've had it , and lost it , it 's like spending the rest of your life in exile . " Sheri placed her hand over his . " Bishop will have everything straightened out by the time you get to Rome . " " I hope so , " said Spencer gloomily . " I thought it did n't really matter , " said Sheri with a twinkle in her eye ? " what with the end of turpitude and all . " " It should n't matter , " Spencer sighed . " But there 's my oldfashioned nature working against me again . Better box office or not , I 'd really rather not be remembered as a molester of children . " " Bishop promised . " " Shall we go , then ? " Spencer motioned for the waiter-proprietor to bring the bill . " If it will make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly another man in to meet us in Geneva , just to be safe . But I 'll bet you by then he 's heard from LaRose . " LaRose was resting on an autopsy table in the hospital of Our Lady of Mercy in Dijon . In the room outside , Inspector Rochard of the Dijon police finished a tasteless institutional lunch provided by the hospital kitchen while he waited for the pathologist 's report . The young man , babbling and incoherent in a room upstairs ,  | was incapable of throwing any light at all on what had happened in the stairwell , or why the two men had been there in the first place . Rochard , not wishing to appear incompetent , wanted to have something concrete to report to Interpol in Paris when he called them , which he would have to do very soon . According to the papers in LaRose 's wallet , he was one of their men . THIRTY-THREE A PATCHWORK quilt of farmlands revolved kaleidoscopically below them as Spencer and Sheri followed the tortuous , steeply graded road deep into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then to pop the pressure in their ears . At last , on a high plateau , they approached an automobile tunnel that cut through a rocky peak dividing France from Switzerland . The French border checkpoint was situated near the mouth of the tunnel . Its candy-cane-striped gate was down , and a uniformed guard stood before it motioning for them to halt . A customs man in civilian clothes came out of the sentry house near the gate . The uniformed guard remained standing , casually alert , in front of the gate , his hand resting on the butt of his holstered pistol . The customs man slowly circled the car , checking the license plates . Finally he approached Spencer 's window and looked in . He was small and swarthy , with a tight , tense face and penetrating black eyes . " You are leaving France , " he said . The nature of his accent was such that Spencer could n't decide whether the man had asked a question or made a statement along the lines of an official notification . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped would cover all possibilities , " we are leaving France . " " Would it please you to show me your passports ? " the man  | said , his eyes wandering with practiced nonchalance over the interior of the car . Spencer handed over Bernadette 's doctored passport and his own . " Have you anything to declare ? " the official asked , as he flipped through the pages of the passports . " No , " Spencer replied . " Would it please you to come with me ? " The man opened the door on Spencer 's side of the car . Spencer looked up , puzzled . " Is something wrong ? " " Please . " The official made a polite little bow and gestured toward the sentry house with his hand , but there was no questioning the note of authority in his voice . " I do n't understand . . . " Spencer began to protest . " The man wants us to go with him , Roy , " Sheri said between clenched teeth . " Let 's not argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed the official to the sentry house . " There have been certain irregularities in recent weeks , " the man said amiably as he ushered them into the house . " You will forgive us , but we have been instructed to carry out certain procedures . " The room was only about nine feet square , with a bare wooden floor and dun-colored walls decorated only with an official photograph of President Pompidou and a calendar with the dates of the month that had passed x-ed out . A darkly varnished government-issue desk , laden with racks of official stamps , papers , and a telephone , occupied the middle of the room . Behind the desk , a closed door led to what must have been the only other room in the small structure : a storeroom , or a toilet  --  or perhaps , a combination of both . The official crossed around behind the desk and motioned for Spencer and the girl to take seats on the wooden bench against the wall across from him . Then , with painstaking care , he again examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked .  | Spencer nodded , a chill running through him as he recalled that the newspapers had him listed as a kidnapper and despoiler of young ladies . " And you are Miss Finletter ? " Sheri nodded . The official laid the passports down and , without taking his eyes off Spencer and Sheri , reached into a drawer and came up with a manila folder . He opened the folder and methodically traced his finger down columns of lettering on the sheet of paper inside . He closed the folder and returned it to the drawer . Then he lifted the receiver from the phone and tapped the cradle with a yellow-nailed index finger to get the attention of the operator . He went about his business with such maddening deliberation that to Spencer , nerves already taut , it seemed that time had become elastic and was slowly being stretched to the point of rupture . At last the official spoke into the phone , asking to talk to the prefecture in Bourg . Another wait followed , succeeded by a monologue in rapid French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . Another wait , while the official listened to the voice at the other end , and then , smiling , he hung up the phone . " Everything is in order , " he reported , handing the passports back across the desk . " We regret to have delayed you . " He rose , crossed around the desk , and opened the door . Spencer and Sheri preceded him into the blinding glare of the sunshine outside . The customs official nodded to the guard , who was standing in position before the lowered gate . The guard nodded in return and moved across the road to raise the barrier . " May you fully enjoy the remainder of your journey , " the official intoned . He made a cavalier little bow and returned to the sentry house . Spencer and Sheri crossed the pebbled walkway to the car , her hand gripping his arm so tightly that he winced . As he opened the car door for Sheri and helped her in , the guard began to raise the gate . Sheri gritted her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind that wheel and let 's get out of here before someone changes his mind . " The gate was all the way up now , and the guard was standing at ease at the side of the road . Spencer got in on his side of the car and turned the key in the ignition . " Now , " said the girl " let 's see how fast you can move us without making it look like we 're running . " Spencer did as he was told , improvising a little flourish of his own  --  a waved salute to the guard as they drove through . " What in God 's name was that all about ? " Spencer asked as he accelerated the car over the hundred yards of open road between the sentry post and the tunnel entrance . He cast a quick sidelong glance at Sheri , who was sitting stiffly , staring straight ahead . " Christ ! You look like you 're waiting for someone to hit you on the back of the head . " " That sums it up quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights as they entered the cool dark of the tunnel . With the car engulfed in blackness , Sheri twisted around in her seat and peered intently out the rear window toward the hemisphere of light that marked the tunnel entrance . " I guess we 're O.K. , " she said . " No one 's following . " " What 's going on ? " Spencer 's voice came out high and anxious . " Slow down to about twenty miles an hour , but keep on moving . " Why would they want to follow us ? " Spencer demanded . " They cleared us through . " " Why do you think they stopped us ? " Sheri replied impatiently . She was up on her knees in the seat , leaning over into the back of the car . " I guess they saw the newspapers and figured they 'd made a big catch . Whoever they called in Bourg straightened them out . So they let us go . Goodbye medals , goodbye promotions ... " " I do n't think they were the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turn off your headlights and take your foot off the  | accelerator . Just roll along with the parking lights on until the car comes to a natural stop . I do n't want our friends , if they 're watching , to see the brake lights go on . " Sheri began opening the suitcases on the back seat . " You think they were the ones ? " Spencer asked , a slow fuse of fear starting to sputter and spark inside him . " That 's exactly what I think . The regular border guards would have been notified not to stop us . " Spencer crouched over the wheel , trying to guide the slowrolling car through the tunnel by the inadequate glow of the parking lights , trying to control the panic that was about to take possession of him . Sheri had finished going through the suitcases . She faced forward in the front seat again , breathing heavily . " They were the ones , all right . And they got what they were after . " The car rolled to a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turn the car around , if you can in this space . Otherwise we 'll have to back all the way out of here . They 're probably on their way already , and I do n't want to lose them . " Spencer could feel the blood draining out of his head . His voice was strident with alarm . " Where 's LaRose ? This is his job ! " " I do n't know ! " Sheri shouted , trembling and desperate . Heart pounding , running away with him , Spencer hauled down on the steering wheel , trying to get the Renault turned around in the narrow tunnel . The rear bumper banged into rough stone . Spencer brought the car forward with a lurch , shattering a headlight against the opposite wall . Straining , panting , cursing , he finally got the Renault facing around toward the French side of the tunnel . A pinpoint of light marked the opening , a half mile away . Spencer sat behind the wheel breathing heavily . He was n't sure whether it was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom . In this dark and narrow limbo he felt
