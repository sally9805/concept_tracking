GOODTIME CHARLEY <P> Book by SIDNEY MICHAELS Music by LARRY GROSSMAN Lyrics by HAL HACKADY <P> If this musical runs long enough to generate word of mouth , the word is likely to be " blah . " Not that Goodtime Charley is malignant ; it is merely inane . It is not clear how the notion entered the producers ' heads that the saga of Joan of Arc raising sword and soldiers to have the Dauphin crowned King of France ( while she ultimately dies at the stake ) had the makings of a musical comedy . At that crazed moment , they should have consulted an exorcist . <P> Charley is one of those torpid hybrids , cutesie Broadway vulgarity grafted onto the bones of history . Charley ( Joel Grey ) , later to become Charles VII , is presented as an adolescent playboy too hot for the flesh ( " I 'm something else/ Unlocking chastity belts " ) to pursue the crown . Actually , Grey with his wistful , tot-like air acts as if he would be happier in a sandbox than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on like a female Vince Lombardi who feels she can psych Charley into a zest for winning . She sings pep talks at him like To Make the Boy a Man and I Am Going to Love ( the Man You 're Going to Be ) . But somehow he never seems to become quite the man that she is . She dominates the action , partly because playgoers can not really forget Shaw 's Saint Joan , though nothing , unfortunately , has been borrowed from G.B.S. <P> Both Reinking and Grey perform feats of theatrical valor , but their talents are wasted . Grey is given only one dance , which he executes with goat-footed guile , while Reinking courses across the stage like a thoroughbred in the stretch . The music races toward oblivion rather than anyone 's ears . Rouben Ter-Arutunian 's majestic scenery features a columned , rotunda-like set with a cascade of steps . This forces Onna White to choreograph dances in which the chorus troops trippingly , and repeatedly , up and down . <P> Subliminally , it all reminds one of those ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey its impression of what a Broadway musical was like . Sadly , Goodtime Charley is not what a good Broadway musical is now like . T.E.K.
