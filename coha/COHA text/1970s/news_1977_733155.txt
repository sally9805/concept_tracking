txt WASHINGTON ? The Supreme Court Friday approved the state funding of textbooks , testing , and outside health services for students in parochial and nonpublic schools , In a ruling with widespread impact on the nation 's private schools , the court held that such state aid programs were constitutional as long as the student ? and not the religious organization ? is the chief beneficiary . But the court , after a detailed examination of an Ohio law , declared unconstitutional the lending of instructional materials ? such as projectors , tape recorders , maps , and science kits ? because they had " the primary effect of providing a direct and substantial advancement of the sectarian enterprise , " THE COURT ALSO Invalidated a provision in the law authorizing the funding of field trips because the schools , rather than the students , would control the timing and , therefore , be the chief recipients of the service . Justice Harry Blackmun , joined by five other justices , concluded that four major provisions of the Ohio law avoided any entanglement with religion as outlawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

The services are performed in public schools or centers located off nonpublic school premises . THREE OF THE justices  --  Chief Justice Warren Burger , Byron White , and William Rehnquist  --  would have gone farther and upheld provisions for field trips and Instructional materials . Justice Lewis Powell , in a separate opinion , stated his approval of field trips and defended the role of religious schools .

The state has , moreover , a legitimate interest in facilitating education of the highest quality for all children within its boundaries , whatever // Court OKs limited aid for parochial students // school their parents have chosen for them . " FRIDAY 'S DECISION marked the first time in several years that the high court has upheld the constitutionality of state aid programs for sectarian grade and high schools , Previous attempts by Ohio , Pennsylvania , and other states to provide such funding have failed in the courts . Justice William Brennan , who complained in a separate dissent that the Ohio law was unconstitutional , charged that " ingenuity in draftsmanship can not obscure the fact that this subsidy to sectarian schools amounts to $88,800,000 , " Brennan saki the subsidy has " a divisive political potential of unusual magnitude .

" There should be a viable alternative for the inner-city child , but right now there is none . " I am hopeful that some day the public schools will be able to do the bb , but until that day comes , this Supreme Court decision will be very helpful , " IN ILLINOIS , $10,000 was appropriated for a trial run of a textbook-loan program for public and private schools in the school year that Just ended , That will grow to an appropriation of $9.5 million  --  about $900,000 of It for private schools  --  for the fall term .

ONE BILL would expand the state-operated textbook-loan program to include the loan of supplies to public and private schools , which may be in violation of the court 's ruling . The other measures would reimburse parents for some of the tuition costs of sending children to private schools . The grants to the parents could not exceed $80 for kindergarten through 8th grade and $75 for high school . in order to allow a court test , only $1,000 would be appropriated for the first year of the program .
