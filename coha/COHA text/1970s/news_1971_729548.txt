txt More than $200-million in city construction for such things as schools , libraries and firehouses has been halted to bring pressure on building trade unions to admit more blacks and Puerto Ricans , City officials , disclosing the new dollar total in the fourmonth-old freeze , conceded yesterday that the tactic would cost the city millions of dollars and months of catch-up time on municipal construction . But they indicated that the freeze seemed about to force the last few unions into line with the so-called New York Plan , which would put 1,000 minority-group-people to work as construction trainees . Agreements with two of the last three holdout unions were " on the verge " of being signed , according to Gordon Davis , a mayoral aide , which would leave only the sheetmetal workers unsigned . " They 'll be so isolated I do n't see how they can hold out , " said another administration official , who declined to permit use of his name on the ground that to do so would diminish his effectiveness in talks with labor people . As yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan , according to Mr. Davis , who said that hiring would have to await agreement by almost all of the unions , and the end of the construction freeze . While the unions have been under pressure from their members to agree with the city , so that the jam can be broken , the city has been under pressure from the people who will use the buildings that have been delayed . Milton Musicus , Municipal Services Administrator and the city 's construction director , said the lists of projects that have been held up  --  plans ready to go out for construction bids ? passed $189-million on June 30 . By the end of July , according to his office , it would reach $226-million and that did not include work for quasipublic agencies . Mr. Musicus 's office listed the following major areas that have been affected by the freeze : C74.6-million for 38 school projects , including modernization of Franklin K. Lane High School in Queens , a new building for the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan , a new P.S. 60 in Staten Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 9$115.5-million for 55 Department of Public Works projects , including work at the Bronx County Courthouse , a public parking garage in Queensboro Plaza , work on the new Family Court in Manhattan , the Clason Point , Lefferts and South Hollis libraries , police stations and firehouses. 91$28-million for a variety , of work in the parks , including the Hall of Science at Flushing Meadow , Queens . 41$7.5-million for a variety of small projects for the City University . Mr. Musicus 's executive assistant , Richard Weston , Said that . $5-million to $6-million worth of traffic lights had also been held up , but that bids for this work were to be asked within the next few weeks . The freeze , disclosed early in March by Deputy Mayor Timothy W. Costello , affected all contracts that might involve work by four unions  --  Local 3 of the Electrical Workers , Local 2 of the Plumbers , Local 28 of the Sheetmetal Workers and Local 638 of the Steamfitters . Yesterday Mr. Davis , the mayoral assistant who has been handling this program , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Plan , " that the electrical workers were " on the verge " of agreement with the city and the plumbers with the Federal Gov-ernment The remaining union , the sheetmetal workers , he said , has jurisdiction oiler heating ducts and so forth . If the city continued its ban , he said , it would prevent completion of considerable construction . But officials point out that as the ' only union left it would be under pressure from other labor , organizations to fall in line and end the freeze . Efforts to reach union leaders for comment yesterday were unsuccessful . Mr. Musicus 's office was unable to suggest a firm figure for the financial impact of the delay , other than to note as a rule of thumb that building prices escalate 1 per cent a month . He suggested that it would take at least six months to work off the current backlog if the freeze ended now . Some city construction contracts  --  work not involving the holdout unions ? have been awarded since the freeze began , Mr. Musicus said , and $643-million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way .
