America 's only adult humor magazine is now a comedy empire <P> Eight years ago , three newly graduated Harvard Lampoon editors had a wild and crazy idea : Why not start the first modern national humor magazine for American adults ? They took the idea to a middle-aged entrepreneur-the publisher of Weight Watchers magazine , no less-and National Lampoon was born . The rest is history , or if not history , then at least hilarity . <P> Today National Lampoon , the brainchild of Douglas Kenney , Henry Beard and Robert Hoffman , is a show-biz empire of comedy . Not only has the magazine been a huge success ( circ. 600,000 ) , but it has also launched popular spinoffs : books , records ( three Grammy Award nominations ) , stage revues , a radio show . Better still , the Lampoon has nurtured a new generation of comic talent . Many of the creators of NBC 's Saturday Night Live , including Michael O'Donoghue , the Chief Writer , are Lampoon alumni .

Last month the magazine published its Sunday Newspaper Parody , an eight-section , $4.95 send-up of Middle American journalism that is starting to hit trade-paperback bestseller lists . This week the magazine 's first film venture , a college satire titled National Lampoon 's Animal House , opens in 600 theaters nationwide . Bolstered by good reviews and Star , John Belushi , the movie is already playing to smash business in New York City and should return a hefty profit on its modest $2.7 million production cost . <P> Though the Lampoon has become big and rich , it has never lowered its scathing comic voice . " What we do is oppressor comedy , " is the proud claim of Lampoon Editor in Chief PJ . O'Rourke , 30 . " Woody Allen says , I 'm just a regular shmuck like you . ' Our kind of comedy says , ' I 'm O.K. ; you 're an asshole . ' We are ruling class . We are the insiders who have chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic pose is superior . It says , ' I 'm better than you and I 'm going to destroy you . ' It 's an offensive , very aggressive form of humor . " <P> Every Lampoon fan has his own favorite outrageous moment . One occurred in January 1973 , when the magazine 's cover photo of a puppy with a gun to its head was accompanied by the headline , IF YOU DO N'T BUY THIS MAGAZINE , WE 'LL KILL THIS DOG . Off-Broadway audiences recall The National Lampoon Show of 1975 , in which Gilda Radner playing Patty Hearst machine-gunned Steven Weed . Lampoon writers routinely savage Kennedys , Nixons , Third World peasants and American capitalists . No one , alive or dead , is sacred . The Lampoon 's last issue included a fictional letter to the editor in which " Larry Flynt " referred to himself as " the George Wallace of porn . " With this kind of animus , it is no wonder that the Lampoon 's first movie has a richly deserved R rating .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
