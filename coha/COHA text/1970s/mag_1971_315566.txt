In The Omega Man , Charlton Heston , barely recovered from a couple of rough bouts on the planet of the apes , appears in Los Angeles as one of the last survivors of a biochemical disaster . Heston passes his days ferreting out evil humanoids transformed by the holocaust . He spends his nights fighting them off with an infra-red machine gun . The creatures-albinos decked out in cassocks and opaque shades-look like a weird rock group . Led by a crazed television newscaster named Mathias ( Anthony Zerbe ) , they assault Heston only after nightfall , when there is no light to pierce their tender pupils . <P> Despite all this frenetic activity , Heston finds time to fall in love , not with himself-although he takes his shirt off rather more than necessary-but with a sassy black fox ( Rosalind Cash ) who pulls him out of an especially nasty scrape with Mathias and the Cassocks . She also makes a point of taking Heston home and introducing him to some plain folks who survived the pestilence . Protected by an experimental vaccine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets out to save what is left of the world . If anyone can do it , he 's the man . After all , as Moses he parted the waters of the Red Sea , and as Judah Ben-Hur he beat the wicked Messala in a chariot race . But the power of pharaohs and Romans are as nothing compared to the wrath of a humanoid TV newsman . Heston should have thought better of meddling with the media . <P> J.C .
