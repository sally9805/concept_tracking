Imagine a vast investment trust , say $1.5 billion or so , that each year takes in hundreds of millions of dollars in small , but regular , tax-deductible cash contributions . Fantasize further that the trustees , with impunity , sink the money into anything they like-the pet projects of some dear friends , for example - while at the same time cutting out of the kitty many of the fund 's supposed beneficiaries . Now let imagination truly soar : the trust 's investment income is all taxfree . <P> Such a gravy train actually exists . It is called the Central States , Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Funds of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , and it is a main source of the bare-knuckled union 's awesome power . But last week the Internal Revenue Service challenged that power by canceling the fund 's tax-exempt status , retroactive to Jan. 31 , 1965 . The IRS will surely have to defend its decision in court , but so far it has not even announced officially that it has changed the fund 's status . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fund 's income theoretically will be taxable at the same rate that applies to single individuals : 70% on nonsalary income exceeding $100,000 a year . Actually , the fund probably will still be free of taxes , past or present . Any benefits payments it makes are deductible , and they tend to be greater than the fund 's investment income . Ironically , the real losers will be either employers who contribute to the fund or rank-and-file union members . Employers , who pay $22 per week into the fund for each of more than 420,000 Teamsters in 22 states , could no longer deduct those payments as a business expense . They might choose to add the $22 to wages instead-wages are a deductible expense-in which case the union members themselves would have to pay taxes on the extra income . Then the workers might have to start making their own , nondeductible , contributions to the fund . <P> The fund may be in for some real trouble , too . Since late last year , a joint task force of the Departments of Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents hundreds of feet thick to unravel the story of the fund 's operations . The Labor Department conceivably could order removal of some or all of the fund 's 16 trustees - eight union men , eight representatives of management-if it finds investments that were imprudent or entailed conflicts of the trustees ' interests . The Justice Department could start criminal prosecutions for fraud . <P> Shaky Ventures . The IRS got involved because it is empowered to cancel a pension fund 's tax exemption if trustees have misused the fund 's assets to the detriment of pensioners . Over the years , the Teamsters ' fund has been accused constantly of doing exactly that . Since its inception in 1955 , the fund has been notorious for making large loans to shaky business ventures , many of them controlled by Mafia chieftains who are cozy with Teamster bosses . Investigators from time to time have turned up instances of kickbacks to union officials or underworld figures for arranging loans .
