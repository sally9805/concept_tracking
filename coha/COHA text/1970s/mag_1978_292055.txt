A California taxpayer revolt threatens official bankruptcy " A gift-wrapped time bomb , " says Los Angeles District Attorney John Van De Kamp . <P> " A disaster , " says California State Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy . <P> " A chaotic disruption , " says Los Angeles School Superintendent William Johnston . <P> " No matter how you slice it , " says San Francisco Mayor George Moscone , " our police , our libraries , our fire department and schools would be crippled . " <P> The reason for all these cries of alarm is Proposition 13 , a measure that would limit California property taxes to 1% of the market value of all real estate , about one-third of current average rates . If approved by the voters on June 6-a strong possibility-the proposition would cost California officialdom about $7 billion in annual tax revenues at the present level . It would also make it harder to raise other revenues because it would require a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature to impose new taxes . <P> <P> Leader of the grass-roots campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jowly , pipe-smoking ex-businessman who has made tax cutting a personal crusade for the past 15 years ( he claims to have blocked 33 different local bond issues ) . " People just ca n't handle the burden any more , " says he . " This is a government of , by and for the people , not the Government . " A year ago , he and his Los Angeles-based United Organization of Taxpayers fell short by 1,200 names of the 500,000 signatures needed to put their property-tax amendment on the ballot . Last May he formed an alliance with the People 's Advocate , headed by retired Real Estate Salesman Paul Gann , and tried again . By the end of the 150-day signature-gathering period prescribed by law , the petition papers were covered with a phenomenal 1.2 million signatures . Another 300,000 signed later to bring the total to 1.5 million-24% of the number of all those who actually voted in California in 1974 . <P> <P> The upsurge reflected increasing voter outrage over constantly rising property taxes , which climbed 48% to 120% in 1976 alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from somewhere else , " says Hal Rolfe , a Los Angeles real estate agent whose own taxes rose from $900 to $2,017 on his Topanga Canyon home and from $540 to $1,913 on his nearby office . A divorced housewife in Van Nuys , Phyllis Waldman , now pays $ 1,568 rather than $750 ; the home she purchased nine years ago for $32,000 was revalued last July at $ 100,000 . A retired engineer in Sacramento , Don Hickman , pays $600 rather than $360 . The house he bought for $11,200 in 1952 is now valued at $42,000.
