A good bet for a young man in search of a future There is an exact moment of time when the vivid brightness of a new experience begins to tarnish , becoming dulled by normality . It is the moment when I prefer to leave , because then the doubts begin , and the excitement of having experienced something remarkable that I want to share with others begins to fade . For Australia this moment came after about two and a half months . It is a Big Country . But not so big that in two and a half months of concentrated travellings and meetings the mind did not begin to question the fabulous uniqueness of everything seen with new eyes . The beer cans winking by every roadside , ' desert daisies ' blossoming even where you think you could be the first whitefella ; the bloated bodies of dead kangaroos ; dead karri trees standing in paddocks like monstrous hat stands  --  ugly in a world of ' cockles ' that does not seem to comprehend ugliness ; the tracks of prospectors ' four  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron-ore executive who could look at an operation costing millions and ask himself Why ? ? why dig iron out of a mountain to kill and maim and pollute people in cities a world away , the end-product a load of scrap . The aborigines  --  above all the abos , the Stone Age blacks , the bloody problem to which there seems no bloody solution . And to the north  --  Asia , the vastness of the Pacific . But it is not of the problems I want to write ; I leave that to the others , all of them Australians . In this introduction I want to convey something of the vivid impact Australia made on me , the uniqueness of that extraordinary , fascinating country . For Australia is unique . It is extraordinary . Geologically it is a world away from any other area on earth . Most of it is a desert ; yet not a desert , for the aborigines have lived in the harsh centre of it in a way that even the Bedu could not claim to live in the dunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter arrives to tell me that the painter , Russell Drysdale , whose brush can capture Australia so much better in paint than one can in words , has just left for the Centre . In what other country in the world would you refer to the interior in those terms ? The Centre . The Red Centre . Like the Dry and the Wet , this is an explicit term , conjuring something real and visual . The uninhabitable four-fifths of Australia is old geologically , very old  --  and it is flat . This combination makes it a prospector 's dream . It is relatively . stable , heat and wind eroding its rocks in situ , so that analysis of a handful of surface dirt is likely to give a fair indication of the mineral content of the rock formation below ground .

In the end , my wife and I had seen more of Australia than most Australians and people were saying to us defensively , ' Yes , I hope to go there some day ' , when we were talking with enthusiasm of some area we had recently visited . // Though Australia is a continent , its distances are not enormous . It is an island with the centres of population clinging to the more accessible coastline , so that the Centre can be as little as 600 miles from the sea , at most only just over 1,200 miles . Alice Springs , for instance , is some 1,200 miles from Sydney , Perth and Darwin , only 800 miles from Adelaide , and the Mice is synonymous with the Centre . But the myth of Australia as a big country remains . It is not distance that makes it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going bush in the outback means a four-wheel drive , water , food and camping gear , and nobody but a fool ( or somebody very experienced ) would undertake a long cross-country journey without the company of one , preferably two other vehicles . As in all desert country , survival is the factor uppermost in the mind . Survival time for a man fool enough to abandon a broken-down vehicle and start trying to walk out with no water , in a shade temperature of 100 ? F , is less than twenty-four hours . This information is given in a survival booklet issued to pilots flying the interior of the country . In the Pilbara region of the North-west I was told of five men who had been found dead or who had disappeared in little more than a year ; in each case they had abandoned a vehicle with water in the radiator and shade under the body . Never leave your vehicle  --  lie still in the shade to conserve body moisture  --  signal for help by burning spinifex , the turpentine content of which emits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney , searches have to be mounted periodically for people who have left their cars and wandered into the bush . I was very conscious myself of this danger when driving alone , and I had not been long in Australia before beginning to understand how much the country dominates the people , always has . And this is true of the new Australians as well as those who have been born there . The city dwellers , too . The sea may call for recreation  --  it is on the doorstep of every city  --  but for adventure it is the interior , the Centre , the red , inhospitable desert that calls , the remote , fascinating , for most not-to-beattained world of salt lakes , spinifex , mulga and ghost gums . A world for which Ayers Rock has become a symbol  --  in the same way that the Barrier Reef epitomises all the strangeness of the sea . These are now the Great Adventures , and Australians , 14,000 miles from their origins and their kin , with all Asia and Russia in between , seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if for most of them it is only a dream , or at best a quick tourist flight to Alice , a glimpse of the Rock and the Olgas . The unique , overpowering nature of the land in which they live seems to have replaced an earlier symbol  --  the Invincible Soldier , the Digger without shining armour , just glorious in his fighting toughness . George Johnston in the first of that superb unfinished trilogy , My Brother Jack , puts it perfectly : The vast dry heart of the land is dead , and it is on this intractable central grimness that the teeth of adventure have long since been Hunted . Here journeys have ended , the pioneering flame has guttered and failed , hopes and ambitions lie buried beneath the blowing sand . It is the one challenge from which the adventurous Australian has always had to retreat , back to the narrow , safer skin of his coastal holdings , and he has been forced to turn his back , because he must , on the invincible wilderness that lies behind him . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the necessary challenges to the flesh and spirit . This is why his wars must befought for other causes than his own  --  and often for strange ones  --  and always in faraway places . He is , because the merciless quality of his own land dictates it to him , the soldier of far fortune . But not now . Not any more . The faraway wars are over . There is trouble enough looming nearer home to satisfy any Australian . And perhaps the breed has changed a little , too  --  so many of those that died so long ago at Gallipoli were from the stations and the outback . The war memorials show the difference in casualty numbers between the First and Second wars . Now , with the media to tell him what the uninhabitable four-fifths of his continent is like , pride in the uniqueness and cruel beauty of his own country has replaced pride in his military prowess . No need for schools to teach the children of immigrants the Constitution or learn great speeches ( if there are any ) in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for them , automatically ; that and the sense of remoteness . Fear , in its more general form , is a great welder of national unity . I must admit I had not envisaged quite such extremes . When we left Melbourne at 08.00 for the Centre in early April it was barely 40 ? F. At Leigh Creek it was 85 ? , at Oodnadatta it was 96 ? , at Mice Springs 105 ? . And it is not only a matter of temperature . Late in March we left Brisbane , a cloudless 90 ? and dry as the desert , to arrive at Cairns late that evening in an atmosphere that was as damply unbreathable as that of a sauna bath . All we had done was move from one end of Queensland to another . The following evening , whilst Brisbane and the country well to the north of it continued to enjoy its superb climate , we had eight inches of rain in five hours . Even the frogs were temporarily silenced and the street outside the Trade Winds Hotel was knee-deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in climate over such relatively short distances , and this poses sartorial problems for the traveller , only solved by a briefcase large enough to carry a change of clothing . Little more than twenty-four hours after we arrived in Sydney , I was on board a friend 's yacht taking part in a short ocean race , the turning mark a buoy a few miles south of Sydney Harbour entrance . Once through the Heads we hugged the cliffs , and immediately a line like an oil-slick showed ahead , the sea turning abruptly from the blue-green of depth and sky to an ugly putrid grey . This was the city 's effluent . Pollution unchecked . Not a problem yet . Not serious , at any rate , for this part of Australia , like New Zealand , lies in the march of the great Southern Ocean 's globe-girdling westerlies . But there , right outside Sydney Heads , the writing is on the wall . Later I was to see air pollution from mining installations . The same universal problem , and the country seemingly so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries have been destroyed are as yet expressing any real concern . The following day , Sunday , we cruised happily in Sydney Harbour , rafting with Ragamuffin in Manly Cove at lunchtime , talking with Gordon Ingate , whose elderly Caprice of Huon is as much admired in my own country as in Australia . Sydney is , of course , the main centre of ocean racing , but since every city has grown up on the coast around a natural harbour suitable for sailing ships , a boat of some sort is the recreational dream of those who are neither surfies nor sub-aqua divers . For sailing men , racing is preferred to cruising , which is hardly surprising , for where do you sail out of Sydney or Melbourne or Perth ? From my own English east-coast estuary I have a choice of eight different countries within four days ' sailing , all with different languages , different customs . For Australian sailors , the South Pacific islands may beckon , Papua-New Guinea , Indonesia , Malaysia  --  but how many of them can spare that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports few and repairs difficult . As a sailor , I think it was this , more than anything else , that brought home to me the country 's isolation . There is internal isolation as well . The world of the sheep and cattle stations is still utterly remote , physically , from the cities , where most of the population lives . Few city dwellers have ever seen kangaroos in the wild , and the aborigines are something only read about or seen in pictures . But air transport is now making a real difference . This , together with television and the mass of books devoted to Australiana , has undoubtedly done a great deal to foster in Australians the current deep feeling for their country . An instinct for survival , too , in a harsh world that may grow harsher as the umbrellas of her bigger racial brothers are progressively weakened or withdrawn . It is difficult now to realise that less than a hundred years ago travel into the interior was dependent on horses , or pre ferably camels . It was n't until 1873-74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the deserts west of Alice . At the turn of the century , the Gibson was still almost unknown . The Canning stock route , pioneered in 1906-7 , cautiously skirted it to the west . In fact , it is only within the last dozen years that the deserts proper  --  the Gibson , the Great Sandy . the Simpson  --  have been accurately mapped by aerial survey . But still no airline will fly the Gibson desert . Flying north from Adelaide , the first salt lake appeared almost as soon as we had cleared the top of Spencer Gulf  --  Lake Torrens , pale white like a vast area of silver sand . And all beyond , a flat plain of red sand  --  red , red , red to the horizon . As we flew out to Australia on a delayed Qantas flight , dinner had been served to us over the ribbed snow and ice of the Labrador plateau , and knowing from personal experience what it was like there on the ground , I felt , strangely , as though I were cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comfort . Now , looking down on the next salt lake and the flat red land running away to the underground opal town of Coober Pedy and beyond , I wondered what it would be like down there where it was all red dirt and the only scrub a darker line marking the dried-up river beds . But the 15,000 feet that separated me from the realities of the country was too big a gap to be bridged convincingly in imagination . And then we landed in Oodnadatta  --  a hut , a little black boy standing on one leg , two Land Rovers and a car that looked as though they had just come out of a red-brick kiln , a wind oven-hot like a North African gibli , and a million flies that seemed the only life around with any energy . Oodnadatta began my initiation into an awareness of what it had been like for men like Warburton and Giles , what it could still be like for anyone whose vehicle broke down  --  or if our aircraft had to make a forced landing . And north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view into the Simpson , mile upon mile of red sand , rippled with the lines of red dunes , regular as a giant sea swell running to the eastward toward a distant horizon . I have noticed that Australians seldom look ( Th out of the aircraft 's windows during flight , almost never have a map in front of them . Is it because they have seen it all before ? Fly anywhere in the outback and the view is pretty much the same , just minor variations of flatness . Or do they feel intimidated by the dreadful vastness of it ? Flying that first time into the interior , I was thinking of the Reverend John Flynn who had started the Flying Doctor Service back in 1928 with De Havilland biplanes . Radio and aeroplanes  --  it was these two inventions that had brought the outback in touch with civilisation . I was thinking , too , of the man 1 had met in Melbourne the previous ? ? ? ? , day  --  Reg Ansett . in retrospect , he seems to epitomise the hard thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wiry , energetic , he started his business career in 1931 , operating an old Studebaker between Hamilton and Ballarat in Victoria . A few years later , with a fleet of twelve cars , he applied for the right to run a service from Hamilton to Melbourne . He was refused , so he bought an old Fokker Univer and made it an air service . He has come a long way since then , battling against government , eating up his rivals  --  Australian National Airways in 1957 , MacRobertston Miller ( known throughout Western Australia affectionately , and sometimes less affectionately , as Mickey Mouse Airlines ) in 1961 ? until now , as Sir Reginald Ansett , he is recognised as the driving force that has opened up the interior of Australia and Papua-New Guinea . The battles have marked him , but the man himself , rugged and independent , has not really changed . And because he has to plan so far ahead and risk so much , he can probably look Further into Australia 's future than most other indigenous tycoons . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are little feeder services in every area . At Ayers Rock it was Saatas , and we were flown over the Olgas by that magnificent old-timer , Harry Purvis , who flew with Kings- ford-Smith . Earlier , out of Cairns in Northern Queensland , we had flown with Bush Pilots Airways , a little outfit formed in 1951 because a grazier had difficulty in getting his wife to hospital in a hurry . Following this unhappy experience , he and four neighbouring graziers got together , purchased a plane and hired a pilot . To keep both occupied they began chartering . Now they have a fleet of more than fifteen aircraft flying around two million miles a year . With this company we flew north in search of Cook and the Endeavour . We used a Cessna 205 and it cost us $A80 , and into that one day we packed pretty well everything that Cook had encountered in that fearful period between June 11 and August 24,1770 . We dived low over Endeavour Reef , where his ship had struck in moonlight late on the evening of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mangroves , the sea discoloured with their juice , and the thin brown glimmer of a creek . This was the great bay across which the damaged ship had struggled , the gaping hole Pothered , but the pumps still barely holding their own . From the air we could see at a glance that it offered no shelter . The same at Hope island . Cook 's highest vantage point was his mast , yet he still made the Endeavour River where Cooktown now stands . We circled this , and then flew north  --  across the jutting finger of Cape Flattery behind which dunes of silica , now exported to glassworks in Japan , show so glistening white they look like drifts of snow  --  to Lookout Point , which Cook climbed , searching for some way out of the treacherous maze of the Barrier Reef which had so nearly destroyed him . Finally we flew seaward to Lizard Island . Lizard Island is where a Cornish woman , Mary Beatrice Watson , wife of a beche-de-mer fisherman , escaped after being attacked by aborigines . She had set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her baby son and a wounded Chinese servant , she rowed away in a tank used for boiling b8che-de-mer , reached a portion of the reef , rowed to two small islands and finally died of thirst . This was in 1881 . Now , less than a century later , most of the Queensland blacks are dead and the directors of Bush Pilots Airways have bulldozed a landing strip so that they can weekend on the island for big-game fishing . Despite the rains , we were able to land , but when we wanted to take off , the engine would n't start . This is a common failing in the small Cessnas when the sun is so hot that fuel vaporises in the fuel line . But common or not , Lizard Island suddenly seemed very remote , very lost , and the dead , Quinkan-filled world of aboriginal superstition moved closer , almost touched us . After take-off I had the pilot circle the island 's summit , so that I had the same view that Cook had had  --  and there , to the north-east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could count four , possibly live , passages through it . We headed then for Cook Pass , swinging and wheeling over it , the sides of it coral-sharp , lace-edged with waves breaking , and the tide swirling through , the gap no wider than the length of a Whitby collier . South and north the their necks in search  --  of what ? A glimpse of their companions ? Or was it for confirmation that they were on course , directed towards the horizon and the reef edge by some instinctual urge ? Western Australia is a world away from the Reef and the tall dark tropical forests of Queensland where the rainfall reaches almost 200 inches a year . To interviewers who asked me why I was there , I sometimes replied that I had come in search of a new Poseidon . Few people in the outside world have heard of Mount Isa or Bougainville or Weipa or Tom Price . But Poseidon  --  yes . In every country of the Western world , probably in Russia , too , Poseidon 's one-time 37,000 per cent increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did for Australia what Eldorado did for the New World centuries ago  --  it put the mineral boom on the world map . Did I find my new Poseidon ? I like to think I did . At least I found something  --  just one mine that captured my imagination . Blue Spec . We came to it in the heat of the afternoon , jolting along a red dirt track from Nullagine in the North West . We were in a land of little hills like tumuli , quartz outcrops white as Parian marble , the sparse scrub shimmering . We topped a rise and there in a shallow valley were the tin buildings of old abandoned mineworkings . Two days before , we had been at Port Hedland , the fastest growing town in Western Australia ; it is the terminal for the Goldsworthy and Mount Newman iron ore and the dredged estuary ships out 12 million tons a year . Before that we had been at Dampier and Tom Price . The port at Dampier was constructed in nineteen months flat and a year later was shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom Price , a mountain half eaten away by 250,000-ton blasts and 120-ton haulpaks , stood under a cloud of cloying red iron dust . The contrast at Blue Spec was unbelievable  --  no great installations , no company town , no sign of life even . We had spent the previous night at the Ironclad Hotel in Marble Bar , which , as everyone knows , records the hottest temperatures in Australia and once recorded 167 consecutive days with the shade temperature over 100 ? F. An hour before , we had left our bags at the Conglomerate in Nullagine , a byword for discomfort , but now just beginning to blossom under new ownership and management . We were 200 miles from anything that could be remotely called civilisation , on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert , and we found the mine manager asleep in his caravan , woke him from his siesta . He was a Yorkshireman with twenty years ' experience of gold-mining in South Africa and he took us up the valley to a small hill where a man in a bucket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A charge had just been fired and he disappeared into a haze of dust . Blue Spec is a rich vein of gold and antimony in quartz , but to separate the gold from the antimony is expensive , which was why the mine had been abandoned . Incredibly , these men were living a rough bachelor existence in this desolate place because China was preparing for the possibility of a war with Russia . The story of Blue Spec is the story of Australian mining in miniscule . Abandoned because the price of gold had not risen with the rise in costs , it was put on the market . A geologist , acting for a prospective purchaser , took a sample from one of the old tailings . Analysis showed it rich in scheelite . Because scheelite is valuable for the hardening of steel , his employers purchased the mine . But nowhere , except in that onepile of tailings , was there any trace of scheelite ! The mine changed hands again . Then China , the world 's main source of antimony , began stockpiling for war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly worth the cost of separating the antimony from the gold again . But the mine itself was unsafe . Everything depended on proving that the vein continued along the valley . That was the position when we stood there in the heat with the flies crawling and examined some of the quartz brought up from that primitive hole in the ground . I still have a piece of it as a memento , for this mine , first opened in 1906 , was named after Blue Spec , winner of the Melbourne Cup the previous year . The winner in 1906 was a horse called Poseidon ' In mining , the reality is a far cry from the excitement of the Sydney and Melbourne exchanges with their ' chalkies ' dancing a strange ballet of euphoria on their catwalk before the long board and the gallery spectators with their noses pressed desperately to the glass . Shares are bought and sold , go rocketing up or crashing down  --  but on the ground there is very little in the early stages to indicate what all the fuss is about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poseidon 's Windarra Range . My wife had been included , I believe the first woman to be invited to visit the Poseidon property . But t hat day the weather clamped down , heavy rains and poor visibility . Nobody flies in the outback when visibility is in doubt . Next day conditions were still not good , but Don Nearn , a New Zea-lander and an ex-test pilot who man-ages the Trans-West circus of Ces-snas , took a chance on it and flew us north to two established nickel properties , Scotia and Carr Boyd . Beyond the fantastic tailing walls of the Golden Mile , the land was flat , and all of it marked by the cleared parallel lines of induced polarisation surveys . At Scotia there was a pop-pet head , for Scotia was already in production , but at Carr Boyd there was no sign of activity , only a tin but and a sign for snooping helicopters in whitewashed stone that read , briefly and to the point ? ' Bug Off ! ' ' You would n't even find that much at Poseidon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engine . As for the sort of country-it 's like this right the way to the Warburton and Petermann ranges . In fact , it does n't really change for a thousand miles . ' This central plateau is mostly well over 1,000 feet above sea level ( at Kalgoorlie it is around 1,700 feet ) and the so-called mountains and ranges are seldom more than a few hundred feet high . They are mountains , of course , in the strict sense of the word , and they look like mountains , too , when seen from the ground , a jagged break on the horizon of a flat , flat landscape . I was thinking of what the Principal of the School of Mines had said-No slopes , no heavy rains , no deep rivers , the rock eroded in situ . When I was in Western Australia , there was a claim-pegging ban in force . The bar at the Palace Hotel in Kalgoorlie was almost empty ; a few months before , during the great nickel rush , it had been filled to overflowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sellers , all intermingled with geological and prospecting outfits in from the bush . But now the only thing Kalgoorlie was interested in was whether the ' Third Madame ' would get her new brothel . It was during this time that I attended one of the most unusual gatherings ever held in Western Australia . Almost ISO prospectors from all over the State gathered in the Compton Dandies ' hall ( a cricket club ) in the town of Boulder at the eastern end of the Golden Mile . They had come there to form a new association to fight restrictive mining laws that had recently been introduced . And they succeeded in getting them altered . Why , I never discovered , for they were a very small lobby . But I remember something one of the mining registrars told me : ' There 's not a mine to my knowledge in the whole of Western Australia that has been found by company geologists , despite all their resources . In every case , the original discovery had been made by the lone prospector , the man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same words had been thrown at me by Stuart Stubbs , prospector and owner of the Comet mine up near Marble Bar . But it is a different matter when it comes to pegging . Pegging had , of course , been going on illegally during the ban and the Minister of Mines very wisely altered the pegging requirements when he lifted the ban on June 4 , 1970 , A friend of mine , who had spent the night of June 3 out in the bush with seven others in Land Rovers , waiting to peg a nickel claim near Nullagine , wrote to me : Unbeknown to us , another party with helicopters were waiting at a different location to peg exactly the same area . The whole battle to complete the task was reminiscent of the old Gold Rush days with modern equipment taking the place of horse and dray . At 12.05 the news came over the radio1 and immediately both parties swung into action , There we were , climbing over some of the most impossible terrain in Australia , racing against men coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hours to complete pegging , and now a mining court will have to decide which of the outfits won the race , i.e. , which company is the legal owner of the claim . There is a passage in a book called Yiwara that every man and woman who has looked with contempt at the disconsolate , idle , near-comatose blacks in their squalid settlements should read . kichard A. Gould is an anthropologist who , with his wife , lived for over a year with the Nyatun-yatjara people of the Gibson Desert . Comparing the dissatisfaction of industrial workers the world over . he writes : The nomadic Aborigines could derive personal satisfaction from their ability to cope with the practical problems of living in 11w desert and in their sacred lives , through kin ties linking them to the land and its natural species . A man could measure his own worth directly by his success as a provider for his kin and his progress through the stages of cult toternism . His detailed account of a day in the life of these people makes his point -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the right wood to make a new spear shaft ) , part emu hunt , and it ends with meal preparations and the making of simple but necessary things . Every moment is thus satisfying to the innate instincts of man that a short period of industrialisation can not overlay . Begging and thieving and laziness , all the dissatisfactions of the whitefella , only touched the aborigines when the daily excitement of achieving survival had been removed . The problem is the same for us as it is for this primitive , but marvellously adapted and desert-knowledgeable black race-how to get satisfaction out of the day-to-day fact of being alive . But at least for the Australian there is still the great challenge of the Centre , still something to fight - and later , as mines proliferate and industry grows , to fight for . Australia is only Big in relation to the smallness of its population , and the attack on the environment has already begun . For the animals , for all the unique marsupials and monotremes-as for the unique race of black men-it began over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danger gives the details . It also shows how the land has been raped by over-grazing , desert in place of pasture-a point punched home by Osmar White in Under the Iron Rainbow .

I hope that what I saw on Heron Island is significant  --  visitors , their children included , spending much of t heir holiday ensuring that the young of a species of turtle that has almost been obliterated by over-fishing reached the sea in safety , Awareness of the need for conservation is something new in Australia , newer even than the changes in custom and behaviour , particularly habits of drinking and eating , which have followed upon the influx of refugees and immigrants from central and southern Europe .

But though a new conception for the majority , conservation is now a subject very much in the public eye . The death of large areas of the Barrier Reef , caused by a population explosion of the ' Crown of Thorns ' starfish ( A canthas ter plane() which feeds on coral polyps , has brought home to everybody how quickly something regarded as permanent can be destroyed . A popular theory was that this proliferation of the ' Crown of Thorns ' had been caused by the enthusiasm of shell collectors for its predator , the giant ' triton ' clam . More probable , since many other coral reefs are being killed off , is that it is the result of man 's pollution of his environment . Whatever the cause . the destruction in such a short time of so much of the Barrier Reef has been given a great deal of publicity , and this has led to public examination of the effect of human actions upon other natural institutions ? the emu and the kangaroo , for instance , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the latter which is being slaughtered for meat factories . And looming even larger is the problem of a century 's destruction of the good land seized from the blacks . Let two of the characters Osmar White met speak for me here .

People in the cities believe that something ought to be done about populating the Never Never . They 're scared that the wogs from over the water will move in . Second , a station owner east of the Leopolds with half a century 's experience of living at peace with the outback ! This is n't country for a man that 's greedy . Stock it to half what you think it can carry at a pinch , and the grass will always come hack .

And then they 've got the bloody nerve to complain about the cost of living in the North . No . They 're not settlers . You do n't settle a country with machines . You settle it with people .
