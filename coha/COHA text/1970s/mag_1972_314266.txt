THE lot of a U.S. Governor today , like that of Gilbert and Sullivan 's policeman , is not a very happy one . Much of his former power has been usurped by the Federal Government . Prison riots or fiscal failures can tarnish his reputation . The Senate in recent elections has become the farm club of presidential succession , rather than the Governors ' mansions , as in times past . Still , the job has compensations , and everywhere in the 18 states where gubernatorial campaigns are under way this fall the battles are vigorous . Some of the more interesting : <P> &gt; DELAWARE . During the first two-thirds of his initial term as Governor of Delaware , everything was breaking right for Republican Russell W. Peterson , 56 , a research chemist and former Du Pont executive whose sideline interest in politics had led him into a full-time career . Peterson revamped the state administration , successfully sought an open-housing law , liberalized abortion laws , and capped it all with a coastal zoning law last year that barred polluting industries from establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day he signed the zoning act into law , Peterson had to admit that his fiscal planners had miscalculated state revenues ; tax increases were necessary to overcome a huge deficit . Disputes arose over welfare , prison riots embarrassed the Governor , and Democrats receiving late income tax refunds charged that the delay happened because the state treasury was nearly bare . Ultimately Peterson was denied routine party approval for a second term and had to beat off a Wallace supporter . <P> In the general election Peterson is opposed by Sherman W. Tribbitt , 49 , minority leader in the state house of representatives . The Governor 's plight would be worse if the lackluster and malapropping Tribbitt were a better campaigner . As it is , the Democratic candidate leads narrowly . <P> &gt; WEST VIRGINIA . They look a little Appalachian as they tramp the West Virginia hills : the gangling 6-ft. 6-in. man ( who gulps three burgers and three Cokes at a sitting ) , his uncomfortable six-months-pregnant wife , and occasionally his little sister . But the man is John D. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Standard Oilman , Democratic nephew of New York 's Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller . Wife Sharon , 27 , is the attractive daughter of Illinois Senator Charles Percy . Sister Alida Rockefeller recently graduated from Stanford . <P> To offset Jay Rockefeller 's name , fame and wealth-his $1.5 million campaign fund is largely family money-Incumbent Republican Arch A. Moore Jr. , 49 ( who has a substantial fund himself ) , is getting personal appearance plugs from six G.O.P. Governors ( excluding Nelson ) , Vice President Agnew and President Nixon . In addition , twelve Illinois Republican Congressmen recently visited West Virginia to diminish the Percy charisma .
