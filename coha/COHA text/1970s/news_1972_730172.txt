txt The Task Force is the most criticized and possibly the least understood element in the Chicago Police Department . It has been tile lightning rod in recent weeks for most of the charges made against the police for alleged harassment and brutality toward black citizens . Saturation Is Resented The 770-man Task Force now called the Special Operations Group has drawn most of the criticism over just one of its many functions : aggressive crime prevention tactics In high crime neighborhoods . Many blacks resent the " saturation patrol " tactic , whirls involves stopping and searching motorists and pedestrians because of minor traffic violations or suspicious look in g behavior . But Police Supt. James B. Conlisk credits aggressive patrol with bringing about the 2.6 per cent reduction in major crimes in Chicago over the last two years . Few people complain about other Task Force functions , such as patroling rapid transit Police Task Force : Main Black Target // stations , controling crowds at sports events and demonstrations , and patroling the lakefront . In fact , few people even know those jobs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive preventive patrols have been under fire ever since the Task F or ce was formed by Police Commissioner Timothy J. O'Connor in 195G . In 1968 , the Kerner Commission on the Causes and Pre vention of Violence criticized aggressive patrols across the " No matter how many people may complain about harassment , our records show that more and more people arc calling police for service . " ? James J. Riordan , Chief of Patrol . nation for their " intensive , often indiscriminate , street stops and searches . " The commission said such practices had " replaced harassment by indivieraal policemen with harassment by entire departments . " In 1969 , State Sen. Charles Chew D. , Chicago demanded removal of the Task Force from black neighborhoods . He charged that " they have been known to pull women out of their cars and search them on the street on the excuse that they had a taillight out on the car . " Complaints did not reach headline proportions , the , until last month when Rep. Ralph Metcalfe D. , Ill. joined other black leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to " Task Forcetype operations . " That was a significant distinction , since tactical units in each district also engage in the kind of aggressive patrols Metcalfe wants stopped . A good example of what the black leaders are complaining about is cited by Ald. Tyrone Kenner 3d , who succeeded Metcalfe in the City Council . Kenner said that early in 1071 , when he was deputy director of the Chicago Committee on Urban Opportunity , he was stopped one day by police at 6 p. m. outside the CCUO office at 46th Street and King Drive . " They were suspicious about my radio-equipped city car , " Kenner recalled . " And even tho I showed my identification , they searched me on the street and looked in the glove compartment . " They even wanted to search the trunk , but before they could I called in on the car radio and convinced them I was okay . " Police today respond to complaints the way Deputy Supt. Kyran Phelan did in 1958 : " We 're sorry if we inconvenienced innocent people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic violation or look suspicious . " Last week , the , top police officials conceded in interviews with The Tribune that aggressive patrol is affecting policecommunity relations . Views Not Changed " I think it accounts in some measure for the controversy in which we 're engaged , " said Supt. Conlisk . " The kinds of stops resulting from aggressive patrol do cause friction , and citizens have some legitimate complaints , " admitted Deputy Supt. Sam Nolan of the Bureau of Community Services . " Some innocent people do get unnecessarily harassed , " said Chief James J. Riordan of the Patrol Division , which includes the Task Force . But they have not changed their views on the need for the Task Force . " I see no reasonable reason to eliminate the Task Force , " said Conlisk . " There has to be a way to put added police in areas where crimes are predictable , and preventive patrols are the way to do it . They are essential to the prevention of crime , " Riordan said . " Aggressive patrols reduce crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our job if we eliminated them , " said Nolan . Complain About Tactics Asked about complaints that some policemen are too aggressive in their patrols , Conlisk said such tactics " are not in keeping with the principles and purposes of the Police Department . " A possible cause of excessive aggressiveness by Task Force policemen is the " point system " under which they work . Capt . Thomas Lyons , head of the Special Operations Group , defended the " informal " point system as a valid way of supervising the men and " evaluating their productivity . " He said arrests for major crimes such as murder and rape are worth 10 points ; arrests for lesser crimes such as petty theft and unlawful use of a weapon rate 5 points ; and misdemeanors such as disorderly conduct and moving traffic violations count for 1 point . Renault Robinson , president of the Afro-American Patrolmen 's League , charged that the point system makes Task Force policemen " like salesmen working on a commission . " He said pressure to make points " leads to 90 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But even the department 's severest critics do not call for the abolition of the whole Task Force . Metcalfe said it is " structured properly for its goal , but it does n't function properly since it spends most of its time stopping black motorists for the slightest infractions . " Robinson does n't want the elimination of the Task Force as such , since he sees the need for it as " a mobile force for emergencies . " An example of what Robinson meant came last Tuesday when the Task Force was called on to control protest demonstrations in the Loop and to restore order at the In- I t erna t ion al Amphitheater , where a veterans ' job fair was disrupted . A significant hint that Task Force aggressive patrol tactics may be in for some revisions came from Riordan . " Fear is what we 're fighting , and we ca n't fight fear without the confidence of the citizens , " he said . " If we 're losing that confidence , then we have to make changes .
