When the nation 's stuffed sports fans waddled their way from the Thanksgiving table to their television sets , they were settling in for the third of a ten-course weekend football feast . Pitt and Penn State squared off at Pittsburgh 's frigid Three Rivers Stadium* at the unlikely ( but prime ) hour of 9 p.m . The game time was arranged by ABC , which split almost $500,000 between the two schools to convince them that rescheduling the contest from a 1:30 p.m. start the previous Saturday made eminent sense . Penn State finally disposed of Pitt ( 31-10 ) by midnight , but the glut of games did not end till Sunday right after a staggering total of 30 commercial-crammed hours of gridiron TV . ( Some of the commercials were ordered up by network-paid stage managers , who signaled game officials when they wanted a break in the action . ) Burnishing the already well-polished dictum that more is better , the networks figured they were giving their viewers precisely what they wanted . Or were they ? Football on the tube has traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the saturation point may be just about at hand . CBS is already in pain over a three-year decline in the number of viewers tuned in to its Sunday National Football League ( National Conference ) telecasts , and NBC 's ratings for its N.F.L. ( American Conference ) games slipped the past two years after four years of growth . So far this year NBC 's ratings have inched up , but CBS 's have continued to fall . <P> The down trend is most pronounced at ABC . Its Monday Night Football telecasts , featuring the logorrheic Howard Cosell , are appearing in 11% fewer households this season than last . Part of the slippage is due to the popularity of two comedy shows , Maude and Rhoda , aired by CBS . For its part , NBC two weeks ago blitzed ABC 'S Denver-Kansas City game by a margin of better than two to one with the first telecast of The Godfather . <P> Swelled Schedule . Whatever their concern , the networks take pains not to show it . CBS and NBC are late in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together they are providing viewers with up to three games every Sunday . In addition , this year 's television schedule has been swelled by as many as four additional college and World Football League contests per week . To fight off the perils of glut and decline , the networks are redoubling their efforts to make the games glossier with replays , added camera coverage and visiting-coach commentaries . If ratings continue to sink , such remedies may not be the answer . Less football might . <P> <P> * The contest had to be switched from Pitt Stadium , which has insufficient lighting to televise a night game .
