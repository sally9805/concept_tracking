txt SPRINGFIELD  --  Legislation putting Illinois ' unemployment insurance law into conformity with federal guidelines was signed into law Wednesday , just one day before state government and businesses faced $700 million in fines . Penalties of $48 million to the state and more than $600 million to businesses were threatened by the federal government unless the necessary changes in state law were made by Thursday . The US . Department of Labor had ordered the state to adopt a law that includes local government employes in the unemployment insurance program and come up with a plan to repay the more than $751 million borrowed by the administration of former Gov . Daniel Walker for jobless pay . GOV . THOMPSON signed the bill a few hours after It was approved by the House by a 160-to-6 vote . The measure had the backing of the administration and Republican leaders and the unwilling support of Democrats . The Democrats , while voting for it to avoid the federal penalties , complained that it would hurt small businessmen and the local governments .

But , he added , " a Democratic Congress has put us into this position , not me . " As he signed it into law , the governor called the bill a compromise because it included the Democrats ' demand that the state help local governments pay their new tax in the first year . He previously stated that no state funds would be used . ILLINOIS WILL contribute $3.4 million and local governments $3.3 million of the $40 million unemployment insurance tax on local governments in 1978 . The remaining $33 million will come from the federal government . Thompson said local governments ought to adjust their budgets to pay higher premiums .

Democrats in the House and Senate attempted in vain to amend the bill so increases in the unemployment tax would be shared equally by big and small businesses . REP . THOMAS IIANAIIAN D .. , one of the most vocal critics of the bill , called it " a typical Republican answer to helping big business at the expense of the little guy . " He said the tax for some 74,900 small employers will be raised from $4.20 per employe to $60 , while the state 's larger employers will get increases of only $18 per employe . Hanahan called it unfair because the smaller employers generally make fewer unemployment claims . Under the new law , the taxable wage base would increase on Jan. 1 from $4,200 per employe to $6,000 , The tax increase on the smallest employer would rise from 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent per employe , with smaller increases for all other employers .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
