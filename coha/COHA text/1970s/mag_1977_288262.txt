CANAL ZONE . PBS , Oct. 7 <P> For the past decade , Frederick Wiseman has been examining American institutions in a series of documentaries ( High School , Welfare ) that are both provocative political statements and innovative works of film . In Canal Zone , one of his best efforts , the director travels to an American realm that is far removed from most of our lives . The results are unexpectedly harrowing . In the sunny landscape of a distant Army enclave in Panama , Wiseman finds a nightmare vision of America itself . <P> The film , shot in 1976 , is not specifically concerned with the treaty that Jimmy Carter is now selling to Congress . Wiseman wishes instead to show how the zone functions . In a progression of characteristically deadpan scenes , he records the mundane activities that define a typical day in the zone : freighters pass through its harbor ; Army wives shop at supermarkets ; the Governor meets with the press . Wiseman is especially fascinated by the community 's many patriotic ceremonies . Whether the Zonians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banquet , they are forever pledging and singing their allegiance to the flag with the fervor of high school students at a pep rally . <P> Canal Zone is three hours long and somewhat repetitive , but its temperature rises steadily as it proceeds . At first it seems that Wiseman has made this film only to poke obvious fun at colonialism : he includes some all too pointed shots of the downtrodden Panamanians who perform the Americans ' menial labor . By the time Canal Zone reaches its Memorial Day climax , however , it becomes as bitter as Sinclair Lewis ' Main Street . <P> Wiseman reveals that the Zonians , for all their manic patriotic ardor , are a rootless and unhappy lot ; their crime and child-abuse rates are well above the mainland rates . Canal Zone thus becomes a study in how Americanism when isolated and left to feed on itself can become a desperate form of mass escapism-and , as such , it is an ingenious cautionary tale . - Frank Rich              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
