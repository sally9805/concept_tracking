The fusillade of shotgun pellets and dumdum bullets went on for six minutes . When it was over , 29 inmates and ten guard hostages at the maximum-security prison outside Attica , N.Y. , lay dead or dying in the early morning drizzle . Last week , one year after the massacre , a nine-member special commission created by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller issued its report* on what happened before , during and after the bloodiest prison riot in U.S. history . Headed by N.Y.U. Law Dean Robert B. McKay , the commission interviewed 1,600 inmates , as well as 400 guards and hundreds of state troopers and National Guardsmen . Among its blunt , plain-spoken conclusions : <P> &gt; The uprising was not planned in advance . Sealed off in one block of the prison , a small group of rioters exploded in a " spontaneous burst of violent anger " at a guard . When a faulty bolt unexpectedly gave way as they shoved on a gate , they suddenly had access to the rest of the prison . " The rebels were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely black , who came to prison full of deep feelings of alienation and hostility , " the commission concluded , but they were not " revolutionary conspirators . " <P> &gt; The four-day negotiations were seriously undercut by numerous mistakes in judgment . The commission did not second-guess Corrections Commissioner Russell Oswald 's decision to talk to the prisoners , but it contended that he should not have negotiated with more than 1,200 rioters looking on . Nor should newsmen and TV cameras have been permitted into the yard , thereby giving rioters a national limelight that they were unwilling to relinquish . The 33 " citizen observers " - an unwieldy group including Radical Lawyer William Kunstler and New York Times Columnist Tom Wicker , were too " racked with ideological differences " to be much help . The commission agreed that granting total amnesty was impossible , but chided officials for not making sufficiently clear to the rioters that there would be an armed assault if the inmates did not give up their last , unacceptable demands . <P> &gt; Governor Rockefeller should have gone to Attica . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission said , but " where state neglect was a major contributing factor to the uprising , " the report said , " the Governor should not have committed the state 's armed forces without first appearing on the scene and satisfying himself that there was no other alternative . " <P> &gt; The assault was poorly planned . No command structure existed after it began , and excessive firepower led to the death and injury of hostages and inmates . Even though the attack was directed by state troopers , prison guards " inexcusably " were allowed to participate . The troopers were ordered to fire only at inmates engaged in " overt , hostile acts . " Nonetheless , unprovoked gunfire was reported by inmates and was apparent in filmed evidence . No adequate arrangements were made for medical care of casualties , a lapse for which " there was no excuse . "
