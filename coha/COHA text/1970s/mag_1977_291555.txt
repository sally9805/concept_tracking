Not everyone knew the author , but the phrase was familiar : " the moral equivalent of war . " It was quoted without attribution by President Jimmy Carter last week in an attempt to mobilize the nation against the squandering of energy . But the words were first uttered in 1910 by Philosopher William James , who had something else in mind . <P> The American pragmatist hated war but nonetheless nourished a great admiration for the military virtues : hardihood , collective fervor , discipline . If these could be diverted from the battlefield , he reasoned , the nation could harness the spirit and energy usually evoked only by local conflict or foreign adventure and be the richer for it . He called for , instead of military service , a " conscription of the whole youthful population to form for a certain number of years a part of the army enlisted against Nature .

Kennedy 's Peace Corps was an attempt to conscript the young without uniforms or weaponry ; during the debates of the space race , Aerospace Executive James McDonnell called the race to the planets " a creative substitute for war . " On the war-ravaged Continent , Jean Monnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he saw it , the interdependence of French and German technology and resources would substitute economic values for military rivalries , altering the context in which Europe 's traditional tribalism had functioned for so long with such frequently hideous results . With some help from the Soviet menace , that part of Monnet 's grand design has worked pretty well . But his further aim of creating a politically united Europe remains a vision .
