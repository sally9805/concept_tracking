For Associate Editor Jos M. Ferrer III , our Law writer for the past six years . May and June have always been busy months , because of the many Supreme Court decisions usually handed down before the summer recess . This year , in addition , Ferrer has had his hands full dealing with the crucial and complex legal problems surrounding Watergate . In our May 28 issue , for example , the Law section examined some of the issues and precedents concerning the impeachment of a U.S. President . Two weeks later , Law focused on the complexities of granting immunity to Watergate witnesses . In the issue of June 18 , the section examined two more Watergate questions : the effect of radio and TV coverage on future legal proceedings , and a matter that was brought up indirectly at last week 's hearings - whether the President could be required to testify before the Ervin committee . In this week 's TIME Essay , Ferrer directs his attention to the remarkably large number of lawyers involved in the scandal . <P> Ferrer once considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after working a few summers for U.P.I , and a stint during his senior year in college as chairman of the Daily Princetonian , he opted for journalism . He came to Time Inc . <P> after graduation in 1961 , put in 13 months with Time Inc. ' s house newspaper , f.y.i. , then joined TIME as our Milestones writer . For the next four years , Ferrer wrote for a variety of sections , including People , Show Business , Medicine , Science , Modern Living and , finally , Law . <P> " I 've always wanted to be a journalist and something else at the same time , " he says . That dual ambition was partially satisfied when Ferrer won a Stanford professional journalism fellowship in 1968 , entitling him to attend Stanford Law School for six months . Concentrating primarily on constitutional and criminal law , he resisted the urgings of a professor who wanted him to remain for a full degree and came back to TIME . <P> " I love the law , " he says , " but I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in this country are finally subjected to the logic of the law that in watching the process , I come in contact with almost every aspect of American life . " <P> For this week 's Essay , contact was somewhat difficult , for Ferrer did much of his writing in a hospital bed while undergoing further treatment for an injury received four years ago in a motorcycle accident . There was one advantage to being confined , he says . " The doctors got started very early in the morning , and after they were through there was nothing else to do but sit up and get to work . " Ferrer relied heavily on background material supplied by Reporter-Researcher Harriet Heck , and on the files of Correspondent Friedel Ungeheuer from New York , Joseph Boyce from Chicago and David Beckwith - himself a lawyer - from Washington .
