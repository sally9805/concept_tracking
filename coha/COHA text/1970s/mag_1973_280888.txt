Since President Nixon agreed to hand over the Watergate tapes , a consuming question in Washington has been whether tapes can be altered without detection . The answer is a qualified yes . The right man with enough time and with access to the original tape recorder could , in the opinion of audio experts , make substantial changes that would defy detection . <P> There is no reason to assume that the Watergate tapes have been tampered with ; that would be a major undertaking . Most experts believe that the necessary know-how could not be found in the U.S. Government , not even among the engineers of the Army Strategic Communications Command . Such skills are scarce even outside Government . Estimates of the number of people able to accomplish the task range from half a dozen to 1,000 . Moreover , not even a qualified man with the nerve and skill of the Jackal would be enough . He would also have to be willing to leave himself open to criminal charges of tampering with evidence . " Whoever would do that would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor at CBS Radio . In an Administration where apparently no skulduggery has been safe from exposure , it is more than likely that sooner or later the man 's name would be leaked . <P> All an expert would need in the way of equipment to alter tapes would be a recording studio , two to four quality tape recorders , a variety of auxiliary gadgets and perhaps an echo chamber . First he would listen to the tape over and over again until he felt at home with the speech patterns-voice modulation as well as breathing space . When he was satisfied that he knew the voices as well as his own , he would do the easy part first-simply cutting out certain words or sentences with a razor blade and splicing the tapes together . This would probably constitute the bulk of his work . From there he would move on to the more complicated tasks : rearranging passages , constructing new words out of word fragments . <P> Once the tape was recomposed , he would have to make sure that it flowed smoothly from beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inflections can now be modified with a device known as a variable-speed constant-pitch tape recorder . " When we increased the speed in the past , " says Goldberg , " we increased the pitch too . The voice sounded like Donald Duck 's . Now we can pick up or slow down without changing the pitch . " Background noise can be simulated by playing a second tape behind the voice tape . Thus , if in the original tapes , doors are slamming , buzzers buzzing , asthmatics wheezing or pipes clinking against ashtrays , all of these sounds can be perfectly duplicated . Such background noises can be used to blur over any foreign sounds caused during the editing of a tape . Says Goldberg : " This kind of masking covers a multitude of sins . "
