txt As you come down the main highway rocking along out of Ft . Bragg into Fayetteville , there it is by the side of the road : the Apex Lounge . Nondescript by day , ill lighted by night , where the fellows like to sit from 8:30 in the morning on and swap war stories , it is a hanger-on at the outer fringe of Army life . There are hundreds of them across the country ; they seem as necessary to military life as braid is to flag rank , as a chest out and a stomach in is to a drill instructor . Stickers on a mirror Two stickers are slapped on the mirror on the left wall . One reads , " God Bless Spiro Agnew . " The other says , " Do n't Let Them Be Forgotten : POWs and MIAs " ( prisoners of war , missing in action ) . Another sign , a baffler , reads , **26;816;TOOLONG what is that supposed to mean ? The waitress , bobbing in time to the music of Charlie Pride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means Your Curiosity Has Just Cost You A Half Dollar For The Juke Box . When it comes to making public noises about politics in an election year military men are like the sound system that suddenly went dead . And participating in politics actively is about as well received in the Army as toting a " down with the general " placard in a demonstration in front of the commander 's living quarters . " So what do you think of the 1972 election , sergeant ? " The sergeant looks at the notebook in the reportorial hand and says , " Oh , no , you 're not . You 're not writin ' down what I 'm say-in ' are ya ? " So into the pocket with the notebook . " OK , now it 's this way , " he says , looking both ways first . " I 've been in the Army 22 years , three times to ' Nam . Plenty for anybody . Too long . And I 'm voting for George Wallace . I think 70 percent of the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that war . Oh , I 've lost a lot of buddies in that place . " Do n't mistake me . I do n't think Wallace should be president . And he wo n't be . He 's too hotheaded . But I 'm going to vote for him . Did last time and I 'll do it again because he understands how I feel . " The sergeant was bracketed in the lounge that evening by two other generations . David Grimes is only 21 and only a year // *Election ' 72 : perspective of 3 soldiers // in the Army . But he had n't entirely made up his mind yet about 1972 except to say : " There are a lot of problems in the country that we may not be able to solve , except by a revolution of some kind . But the biggest thing we need is to understand each other . " My Dad is a policeman in Ohio . Was with the cops at Kent State when those four students were shot by the national guard . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a student myself and all my sympathies with them . But I listened to Dad and appreciated his point of view even if I did n't agree . At least we tried to understand each other and we can get along . " Veteran 's opinions Quincy McPhail runs the Apex Lounge . He 's an ex-Army warrant officer , retired since 1969 . " Would have retired in ' 66 , " he says . " Tried to , but I was a helicopter pilot and had n't been to Vietnam yet . And all helicopter pilots had to go . So I had to go before I could retire . " Now Mr. McPhail , is president of the Retired Military Association of North Carolina . Its 1,000 membership is a fraction of the 18,000 retired military men in the state . But it is organized , politically active , and busy screening candidates to endorse in the coming election . " Something happens to a military man when he gets out . For years he is used to being told what to do . But once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including how to vote . " It 's true many military men do n't like Nixon . But you got to remember military men usually never like a president after he 's been in office one term . Generally he 's done something or said something to make them mad . General Eisenhower was one of the most unpopular presidents with military men after he said what he did about them being overpaid and underworked . " Favorites unmentioned But if military men have a favorite candidate in this year of the unwinding of Vietnam , the men of Apex Lounge were n't letting it out . Mr. McPhail wo n't because " a lot of these retirees get pretty riled up when you try to talk politics with them . You would never have thought they were once nonpolitical , would you ? And I do n't want to start any fights . " David Grimes is still undecided himself and figures it is hard enough just worrying about getting out . And the sergeant ? he 's still too mad about ' Nam to want to talk anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For The Juke Box .
