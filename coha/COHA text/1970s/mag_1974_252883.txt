The Spanish christened it Isla de los Alcatraces , Isle of Pelicans . But to generations of moviegoers and newspaper readers , the island in San Francisco Bay has been better known as the Rock , the ultimate roost for a tougher kind of fowl - the jailbird . Alcatraz was decommissioned as a prison in 1970 and is now part of the Golden Gate Recreation Area . Since it was opened to the public by the National Park Service last October , the U.S. equivalent of Devil 's Island has become San Francisco 's biggest tourist attraction . <P> To date , more than 60,000 visitors have paid two dollars each for the round-trip boat ride and one-hour guided tour of the pen . Though there are 13 scheduled tours a day , come gale , fog or high water , tickets for weekends and holidays are sold out a month in advance . Tourists include some of the Indians who occupied Alcatraz in 1970 , penologists , historians , police officers , prison wardens , troops of schoolchildren and an occasional former inmate ( one ex-con insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what he had been through ) . <P> The ordeal that he and other inmates endured is not underplayed . A staff of 13 young , well-briefed Park Service rangers go deep into Rock lore : the men who came there , how they were treated and mistreated , how they lived , died and plotted escape . " Men were never sent directly to Alcatraz , " Ranger Jane Rowley points out . " They always came as transfers and were considered the hardcore troublemakers , the incorrigibles . <P> This was never a place of rehabilitation . " In the freezing rows of three-tiered cell blocks-one called Michigan Avenue , another Broadway-Ranger Sara Conklin says ( with some exaggeration ) , " Most prisoners died of pneumonia . " <P> Leading her charges into the isolation wing , Sara explains that prisoners relegated to the " strip " or " oriental " cells were left naked , without blankets or light . " Try it , " she tells a group of students . " Go into the cell , and I 'll close the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours a day . " After five minutes , the kids emerge , solemn-faced and committed to lives of virtue . Next , Sara points down ten stone steps to the " dungeon of Alcatraz . " That was where the prison authorities would try to break a man , she explains , " when he was still able to say , ' I am me . ' His hands were manacled to the walls , there was a lot of putrid water on the floor and lots of rats . " The tour includes thumbnail sketches of such famed alumni as Al Capone ( " He had syphilis and eventually died of it " ) and Robert Stroud , the so-called Birdman of Alcatraz ( " The movie was a bunch of hooey - Stroud was a nasty person who killed two men " ) . <P> According to present plans , Alcatraz will be operated as a tourist attraction only for the next five years . Ideas for its future use are solicited from the sightseers , who have suggested , variously , that it should eventually be turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , a U.N . memorial , a seminary , an Indian amusement park or a monument to the conquest of space . Some stern-vis-aged visitors think it should become a prison again , but others suggest simply giving it back to the pelicans .
