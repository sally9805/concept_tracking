txt President Carter is said to believe that Egypt and Israel must reach agreement on two difficult issues within only a few months  --  or the Middle East peacemaking process will break down . The President is reported to have stressed the urgency of the situation ? saying that the next few months are crucial ? in a recent meeting with the presidents of major American Jewish organizations . At one point , according to a participant in the meeting , which came just after Egyptian President Sadat 's visit here , Mr. Carter said progress must be made within two months . But the same participant said he had the impression that if negotiating progress were being made , the two months could be stretched to three or four . The important point , this source said , was that Mr. Carter is convinced that the time is getting short for an agreement on the two obvious sticking points : ( 1 ) Israeli settlements in the occupied Sinai , and ( 2 ) the principles of how to deal with the question of Palestinian self-determination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principles , the source said , with details to be negotiated later . The disclosures concerning President Carter 's feeling that quick negotiating progress is needed came as the administration announced its long-expected decision to sell F-5E fighter planes to Egypt . The sale would mark an important turning point , because previous U.S. military sales to Egypt , involving transport planes among other things , have not included " lethal weapons . " The State Department justified the decision on the grounds that the plane is a " defensive " // From page Carter on Mideast aircraft needed to bolster Egypt 's confidence in the ' negotiating process and to meet Egypt 's needs for self-defense in light of its loss of Soviet military aid . Under the arms package announced by the State Department Feb. 14 , Egypt would get 50 of the F-5Es . Saudi Arabia would get 60 F-15 fighters , and Israel would obtain 75 F-16s as well as 15 F-15s to be added to the 25 F-15s it already has . Israel was expected to object both to the fighter plane sale to Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress in the Egyptian-Israeli talks . Both the sale and the " timetable " were seen by pro-Israeli sources as a form of U.S. pressure on Israel to make negotiating concessions . Israel is also expected to be unhappy with the number of F-16s being offered by the U.S. The Israelis had requested 150 . " You ca n't negotiate under a deadline , " said one well-placed member of the organized Jewish community in reference to President Carter 's negotiating timetable . " This is not the way to operate the negotiating process . " This same source said that the sale of the F5Es to Egypt should not come in advance of progress in the Egypt-Israel peace negotiations but should be held out as a " carrot " to reward negotiating progress . " It 's too delicate a period in the negotiating process to be selling offensive military equipment to Egypt , " the source said . So far , the so-called pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. Congress has not focused on the question of the sale of the F-5E fighter plane . But lobbyists have mounted an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales package which would call for the sale of F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia . The F-15 , the most advanced of the U.S. fighters , is a much more sophisticated plane than the F-5E .

In his meeting with the presidents of major American Jewish organizations , President Carter did not specify what he meant by a possible " breakdown " in the peacemaking process , should no progress be made within the next few months . On the Palestinian issue , President Carter was reported to have reiterated his belief that a four-to-five-year period of an internationally guaranteed joint administration of the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip should be followed by a " limited choice " referendum in which the Palestinians would choose either to align themselves with Jordan or to continue the joint administration .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
