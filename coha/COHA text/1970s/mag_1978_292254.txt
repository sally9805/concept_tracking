The toll : 51 workers <P> To the Shawnee Indians , the jagged mountains of West Virginia were " a dark and bloody ground , " a realm of ferocious evil spirits best avoided . But there was no hint of danger on a sunny morning last week when 51 steelworkers , carpenters and laborers clambered 168 ft. up scaffolding inside a cooling tower at the Pleasants Power Station near St. Marys , W. Va. , a hamlet of 2,348 nestled between verdant hills and the Ohio River . When completed , the 450-ft. tower will cool water used by the generating plant before returning it to the river . <P> Suddenly , a rumbling , thunderous crash rolled across the construction site , accompanied by screams . " The first thing I heard was concrete falling , " said John Peppier , 38 , a laborer who was working at the base of the tower . " I looked over my left shoulder and I could see the scaffolding falling . Then I could see people falling . Then , everything falling . " <P> Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cement that had been laid the previous day , and hurtled to the ground . Said Katie Robinson , a worker 's wife : " When the scaffold began to fall from one end , 12 or 15 men were trying to find a way off , and they walked back one way and then they turned around , and I thought they were going to try to jump . But then it all came down and the safety net wrapped around the men . I could see them all bundled up inside , and they fell . " <P> Stretcher-bearers and emergency workers were confronted with tons of debris-steel , concrete and boards-piled 6 to 10 ft. high on the floor of the tower . " There was so much stuff on the ground you could n't see the bodies , " said Construction Worker Bill Hess . Rescuers worked frantically for six hours to pull apart the debris , but found no survivors . <P> Most of the dead workers had come from nearby West Virginia farms , and their families gathered that afternoon at a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a makeshift morgue . One worker at the tower , Robert Steele , 35 , lost ten members of his family-four brothers , three uncles and three cousins . Friends and relatives consoled each other as Red Cross workers called out the victims ' names . A young pregnant woman , waiting to identify her husband 's body , sobbed on her mother 's shoulder . At dusk , small groups of workers and relatives gathered solemnly outside the chain-link fence surrounding the piles of rubble at the tower 's base . Near the tangled mass of steel stood a faded sign : MAKE SAFETY A BELL-RINGER THIS YEAR . ?
