txt The world 's 10 leading nonCommunist industrial nations reached agreement tonight on a new pattern of currency exchange rates , including a devaluation of the United States dollar by 8.57 per cent . Speaking to reporters as the negotiations ended , President Nixon ' said , " It is my great Text of President 's remarks and communique , Page 56. privilege to announce , on behalf of the finance ministers and the other representatives of the 10 countries involved , the conclusion of the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world . " The new United States 10 per cent import surcharge will be removed next week , The surcharge was imposed , and the entire recent monetary turmoil began , with President Nixon 's dramatic domestic and international economic measures of August 15 . Yen to Go Up Several other currencies , led by the Japanese yen , will be revalued upward . Treasury Secretary John B. Connally said that the over-all effect would be an effective devaluation of the dollar by 12 per cent . This figure is arrived at by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Canadian dollar , which will continue to float in daily trading , was left out of the calculation . A communique issued by the Group of 10 , said that most foreign exchange markets would be closed on Monday , but Mr. Connally said the United States market would be open . The dollar devaluation figure of 8.57 per cent used by Mr. Connally results from a pro'posed increase in the official price of gold from $35 to $38 an ounce . Congress , however , will not be asked to approve the necessary legislation to increase the gold price until the United States wins concessions from Japan , the European Common Market and Canada on trade matters . However , foreign exchange trading  --  that is , the actual exchange rate of the dollar against the other currencies ? will be conducted at levels as if the new gold price were already in effect . As in all cases of changes in a currency 's exchange rate , the percentage of dollar devaluation can be calculated in two ways , The figure used by Mr. Connally of 8.57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a currency  --  such as the British pound , which did not change in value  --  to an American buyer . For a foreigner buying dollars , the devaluation will be 7.89 per cent . The latter figure is the technically more correct of the two . The Group of 10 communique left to each country to an- , nounce its new exchange rate . However , most of the rates quickly became known here . For example , the Japanese yen will rise in value against the dollar by just 15.88 per cent with a new yen rate reported at 308 to the dollar . The 17 per cent upward revaluation of the yen comes in part through the devaluation of the dollar and in part through a revaluation of the yen . The British pound and French franc will remain unchanged in terms of gold , meaning they will rise by 7.89 per cent against the dollar . The West German mark will be set at 3.22 marks to the dollar for an upward revaluation of about 12 per cent . Lira and Kronor Revalue The Italian Era and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent against gold . This will still leave them significantly higher in relation to the dollar than before . The Canadian dollar will continue to float . The Canadian Government pledged not to manipulate the rate through intervention by its central bank in foreign exchange trading . Mr. Connally said he expected the Canadian dollar to rise somewhat from its present value of almost exactly one United States dollar . Besides the currency realignment , the agreement included another significant change . For the indefinite future , currencies will be allowed to fluctuate above and below their par values by 2.25 per cent , compared with only I per cent under the former monetary rules . It is hoped that this change will both ease the transition to the new exchange rates and reduce heavy flows of speculative funds . Convertibility Unsettled Under the agreement , dollars held by foreign central banks will continue to be inconvertible into gold or any other United States monetary reserve asset . That is , President Nixon 's suspension of buying and selling of gold remains in effect . The delicate question of ultimate convertibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping reform of the world monetary system . But meanwhile , ordinary trading , travel , and investment can proceed at reasonably known and fixed ex ? change rates . The agreement  --  the first in history involving a multinational negotiation of exchange rates  --  was reached after two days of secret talks among finance ministers and central bank governors of the 10 nations in the 116-year-old red castle building of the Smithsonian Institution . Just before the final communique was issued , President Nixon appeared dramatically before nearly 400 representatives of the world press in the Art and Industries Building next door , accompanied by many of the ministers of the 10 nations . Besides the United States , the countries in the Group of 10 are Britain , Canada , Japan , Sweden , Belgium , France . West Germany , Italy and the Netherlands . Asking himself the hypothetical question of " who won and who lost , " the President said " the whole free world has won . " Simultaneously with the removal next week of the 10 per cent import surcharge , the President will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new business investment ; tax credit just enacted by Congress to help stimulate the domestic economy . As enacted , the bill provided that this special tax benefit would not apply to pur-1 chases of imported machinery and equipment as long as the import surcharge lasted . The communique recognized that scores of nations , including such important trading nations as Australia , were not represented here . It said : " The ministers and governors recognized that all members of the International Monetary Fund not attending the present discussions will need urgently to reach decisions with respect to their own exchange rates . It was the view of the ministers and governors that it is , particularly important at this time that no country seek im'proper competitive advantage through its exchange rate policies . Changes in parities can only be justified by an objective appraisal which establishes a position of disequalibrium . " Despite this admonition , many . countries including most of Latin America , arc expected to devalue along with the dollar . There would presumably be no international objection to such a move .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
