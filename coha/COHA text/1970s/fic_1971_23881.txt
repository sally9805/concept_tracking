anybody , in definitiveness ( sic ) , is not telling the truth . " Plaintiff lawyers were quick to point out that Robotti himself had said it . The defense attorneys , in their summation , did not spare each other 's clients . Smyth described Robotti 's long , unpaid service to the Knights in helping to induct 25,000 dues-paying members . He asked rhetorically what Robotti had received for it . " He received , " said Smyth , " an appearance in this court by the Supreme Knight who attempted to whitewash and divest himself and the national organization of any knowledge of what occurred . " Smyth called McDevitt " evasive " in denying he knew of " phony priests or the use of a man with a dog bite . " " This was the unity Mr. Robotti received for eighteen years , " Smyth said quietly . " This was the strong fibre of the national organization of the Knights of Columbus , leaving Mr. Robotti hanging by a thread . " Attorney O'Connell was equally explicit : " We say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robotti 's responsibility . He was off on conduct of his own for which the Knights of Columbus is not responsible . " As the jury deliberated , McManus sought out Robotti in the corridor . He shook his hand and said , " I think you 're an honest guy . And I want you to know that , whatever the jury decides , never take a dime from you . " The jurors , in a complex finding , decided that Mc ) / ! anus had been injured and that Robotti had assaulted him . But they ruled that the injuries resulted directly from unlawful imprisonment in the hot box caused by Robotti while acting as an agent of the Knights of Columbus . McManus should receive $60.000 and O'Neil $10,000 from the Knights . Robotti sighed with relief . McManus cried and thanked the jurors . Some of the jurors cried too .

I felt he was sincere . But as far as losing faith concerned  --  think of the people who suffer frog cancer or something , who watch a loved one Look at God sending His Son to be crucified a Christ on the cross . That 's a real test of faja McManus got off easy . " Does he still believe in the old third de " Slapping around was the traditional meth and I followed it .

The jury proved that , no matter what you are in life , you can stil win out with the truth . " He pauses , smiles , ' And with a good lawyer  --  I do n't kid myself about that part . " The verdict has apparently restored his once flagging faith in the system . But he believes the judges , jurors , and lawyers had a large assist . " You know , Bethel means House of Cori , " says .

" 80 SUBLIMATING HE MAPLES AGREED THAT , since sex was the I only sore point in their marriage , they should give it up : sex , not the marriage , which was eighteen years old . A week went by . On Saturday , Richard brought home in a little paper bag a large raw round cabbage . Joan asked , " What is that ? " " It 's just a cabbage . " " What am I supposed to do with it ? " Her irritability gratified him . " You do n't have to do anything with it .

You know what an impulse is . " Rubbing it in . " When I was a kid , " he went on , " we always used to have a head of cabbage around : you could cut a piece off to nibble instead of a candy . The hearts were best . They really burned your mouth . " " Okay , okay . " Joan turned her back and resumed washing dishes . " Well I do n't know where you 're going to put it since Judith turned vegetarian the refrigerator 's already so full of vegetables I could cry . " Her turning her back aroused him . It usually did . He went closer and thrust the cabbage between her face and the sink . " Look at it , darley . Is n't it beautiful ? It 's so perfect .

He chose , not the 1,31 ? three cents . And now , cutting a slice from f : pale cheek , he marveled across the at Years compacting miracle of the wound , at the tender co e un of the leaves , each tuned to its curve as , tight as a guitar string . The taste was blander than childhood memory of it , but the texture w , , ; . licious in his mouth . Bean , their baby , ten , came into the kitchen , " What is Daddy eating ? " she asked , looking into the empty bag for cookies . She knew Daddy asa snack-sneaker . " Daddy bought himself a cabbage , " Joan tuld her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pre-prepared ; th was a serious warmth that Mommy and animals , especially horses , gave off , and everything else had the coolness of comedy . " That was silly , " she said . " Nothing silly about it , " Richard said . " Hate ! a bite . " He offered her the cabbage as if it were an apple . Inside her round head he envisioned leaves and leaves of female psychology , packed so snugly the wrinkles dovetailed . Bean made a spitting face and harshly laughed . " That 's nasty , " she said . Bolder , brighter-eyed , flirting : " You 're nasty . " Trying it out . Hurt , Richard said to her , " I do n't like you either . I just like my cabbage . " And he kissed the cool pale dense vegetable once , twice , on the cheek ; Bean gurgled in astonishment . Her back still turned , Joan continued from tht sink , " If vou had to buy something , I wish you 'd ; rowed Calgonite . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - , , fieroerriber it yourself , " he said . " Where 's the wrap for my cabbage ? " But , as the week e on , the cabbage withered ; the crisp planear uria of each slice by the next day had browned loosened . Stubbornly loyal , Richard cut and bled his slow way to the heart , which burned hi , tongue so sharply that his taste buds even their adult dullness were not disappointed ; remembered how it had been , the oilclothvered table where his grandmother used to hoffz " cabbage into strings for sauerkraut give him the leftover raw hearts for a snack . he did not buy another cabbage , once the was eaten ; similarly , he never returned to a tress , once Joan had discovered and mocked Their eyes , that is , had married and merged three . and in the middle shared one her dry ronale-to-female clarity would always oust his . mlic mists .

Nevertheless , he asked , " What have you up to today ? " ' Same old grind . After school I drove Judith her dance lesson . Bean to the riding stable , fickle to the driving range . " " Where was John ? " " He stayed home with me and said it was borig . I told him to go build something so he 's idding a guillotine in the cellar ; he says the limh grade is studying revolution this term . " What 's he using for a blade ?

You put three quarters in and stay in the car and it just happens . It 's hilarious . " " What happens ? " " Oh , you know . Soap , huge brushes that come whirling around . It really does quite a good job . Afterwards , there 's a little hose you can put a dime in to vacuum the inside . " " I think this is very sinister . The people who are always washing their cars are the same people behind our boys in Vietnam . Furthermore , it 's bad for it . The dirt protects the paint . " " It needed it . We 're living in the mud now . " Last fall , they had moved to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow wild . This spring , they attacked the tangle of Nature around them with ominously different styles . Joan raked away dead twigs beneath bushes and pruned timidly , as if she were giving her boys a haircut . Richard scorned such pampering and attacked the problem at the root , or near the root . He wrestled vines from the barn roof , shingles popping and flying ; he clipped the barberries down to yellow stubble ; he began to prune some overweening yews by the front door and was unable to stop until each branch was a stump . The yews , a rare Japanese variety , had pink soft wood maddeningly like flesh . For days thereafter , the stumps bled amber . The entire family was shocked , especially the two boys , who had improvised a fort in the cavity under the yews . Richard defended himself : " It was them or me . I could n't get in my own front door . " " They 'll never grow again , Dad , " Dickie told him . " You did n't leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boy 's own eyes were green ; he kept brushing back his hair from them , with that nervous ladylike gesture of his generation . " Good , " Richard stated . He lifted his pruning clippers , which had an elbow hinge for extra strength , and asked , " How about a haircut ? " Dickie 's eyes rounded with fright and he backed closer to his brother who , though younger , had even longer hair . They looked like two clumsy girls , blocking the front door . " Or why do n't you both go down to the cellar and stick your heads in the guillotine ? " Richard suggested . They ran away . In a few powerful motions he mutilated a flowering trumpet vine . Richard had a vision , of right angles , clean clapboards , unclouded windows , level and transparent spaces from which the organic  --  the impudent , importunate , unceasingly swelling organic  --  had been finally scoured . " Daddy 's upset about something else , not about your hair , " Joan explained to Dickie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
