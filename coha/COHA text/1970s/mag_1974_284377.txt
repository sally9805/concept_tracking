It has not been the best of Richard J. Daley 's 19 years as mayor of Chicago . In May , Daley , 72 , suffered a stroke that required an operation and more than three months ' convalescence . Then three Pooh-Bahs of the Daley machine-including Hizzoner 's right-hand man . Alderman Thomas Keane-were convicted in federal court of charges ranging from mail fraud to income tax evasion , bringing to a total of ten the number of powerful machine men who have been convicted . In a recent series of articles , the Chicago Tribune , in conjunction with the Better Government Association , documented shocking waste in the city government . With mayoralty elections due next spring , all this caused some Daley foes , and even a few admirers , to nurture the thought that Daley at last might be prepared to step down . <P> But the mayor put an end to such speculation last week when he announced that he would seek an un precedented sixth four-year term . Though his well-known , raspy voice was subdued and his bulky frame some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Daley has regained a large measure of his old vigor , and relishes his job as much as ever . His peacemaking role at the Democrats ' Kansas City convention two weeks ago reinforced that image . <P> To win this time , Daley may have to overcome as many as four opponents in the Democratic primary in February-the first major opposition he has faced from within his own party since his first run for mayor in 1955 . The strongest challenge comes from Alderman William Singer , 33 , who led the delegation that was seated instead of Daley 's at the 1972 Democratic Convention . Singer , brash and scrappy , has charged Daley with wholesale neglect of the city 's deteriorating school system , and plans to visit all of the city 's 584 public schools personally before the primary . <P> But Richard Daley , virtues and flaws , is an institution : even Chicago voters who disagree with the man often take a perverse pride in their battle-scarred mayor . So it is widely assumed that Daley will triumph in the primary as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , no substantial Republican opposition has been found for him . Though no scandal has touched Daley personally , questions have been raised in the press about the propriety of his secret ownership with his wife of a real estate holding company that made purchases of vacant lots in a city auction . He has freely acknowledged influencing the placement of millions of dollars worth of city insurance with an agency that employed one of his sons . Neither issue is expected to have much impact on the voters . Daley 's prospects seem excellent for remaining the longest-running big-city mayor in the U.S.
