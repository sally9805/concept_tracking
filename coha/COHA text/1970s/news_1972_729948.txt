txt President Nixon entertains this not-so-secret yearning : Before his presidency is done , before his last race is run , before history has recorded his final electoral vote ? he longs to carry Texas . Oh , how he has tried . Twice . But it has always been defeat snatched from the Jaws of victory , the butterfly dodging the net , the gold that did n't pan out , the fumble on the one-yard ? Republicans rarely have carried Texas  --  only three times in the last 27 presidential elections . But Dwight D. Eisenhower , with Mr. Nixon as his running mate , made it look easy in the 1950 's . He carried Texas twice in a row . You would have thought Mr. Eisenhower was Sam Houston . But Mr. Nixon just has n't found the proper angle at which to hold his mouth or cross his fingers when running in Texas . For a glimmering 24 hours in 1960 , just after John F. Kennedy was nominated for president by the Democrats and before Lyndon a Johnson was nominated for vice-president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have voted for John F. Kennedy . But it could n't not vote for Lyndon Johnson , In 1968 Mr. Nixon looked good on paper , His Democratic foe was Hubert H. Humphrey , whom most Texans mistook for a distant cousin of Karl Marx . The most powerful Democrat in the state , former Gov . John Connally Jr. , was quietly helping raise funds for Mr Nixon . It coud n't have looked better , except for the worrisome third-party presence of Alabama 's George Wallace on the ballot . But at the last moment Mr. Connally was observed putting his arm around Hubert Humphrey in public // *It looks good ( on paper ) for Nixon in Texas // That , together with the Wallace vote and a few other factors and ? proof ? there went Texas again by 40,000 votes . It could n't have looked better , except for the worrisome third-party presence of Alabama 's George Wallace on the ballot . But at the last moment Mr. Connally was observed putting his arm around Hubert Humphrey in public . That , together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? there went Texas again by 40,000 votes . Ah , but now it 's 1972 and another chance  --  a last chance , and things again look good on paper . If they keep looking that way , Mr. Nixon may be able to write in this satisfying footnote into his political memorabilia : " Whew , " I finally won Texas . Hello , Ike ; hello , Warren Harding , you 're the only other GOPs who ever did it " Besides , Texas represents 27 electoral votes ? no small pickings ? and would be a major bleak in the redoubtable Southern wall of usually Democratic states . Registered voters tallied You are out on a limb with a saw every time you say a Democrat wo n't carry Texas . But there is a lot of limbmanship going on here now . If Mr. Nixon was running for governor he might never ever win Texas . Over half the registered voters in the state are Democrats . Only 17 percent are Republicans , and the rest are independents . Texans like to have Democrats running things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then does n't seem to hurt anything . When Lyndon Johnson quit to run as vice-president with John Kennedy in 1960 , a Republican , John G. Tower , finally wound up in his U.S. Senate seat , is still there , is running for reelection and , with Mr. Nixon , is favored to win again . Mr. Nixon is favored in Texas for several reasons . First , there is John Connally , who four years later is still the most powerful Democrat in Texas despite being Mr. Nixon 's Secretary of the Treasury . Republican leaders in Texas expect Mr. Connally to do all he can , while remaining a Democrat , to reelect Mr. Nixon . That is nothing unprecedented . When Dwight Eisenhower was running in 1952 , the then most powerful Democrat in Texas , Allan Shivers , was doing the same thing ? staying a Democrat , but working for the Republican presidential candidate . Texas in those days wanted its tidelands . Mr. Eisenhower was saying yes , they could have them . Adlai Stevenson was saying no they could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine Sen. Edmund S. Muskie , opposing the oil-depletion allowance , which in Texas is like sitting in the Longhorn cheering section and rooting for Arkansas to win the football game . Democratic Lt. Gov . Ben Barnes , the second most powerful Democrat in Texas next to John Connally , is running for governor this year . He reckons Senator Muskie has got to spend a lot of time in Texas before election day and have a lot of prominent Texans put their " brand of approval on him " if he hopes to beat Mr. Nixon . Another point : Mr. Nixon helps his chances of carrying Texas by keeping Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew as his running mate . Last time around the man who cost Mr. Nixon Texas was George Wallace , running as a third-party candidate and winning 19 percent of the votes . Those were Nixon votes . Nixon 's votes sidetracked This time some conservative Texans are saying that Mr. Agnew is just as acceptable as Mr. Wallace . And if he is going to be on the Nixon ticket , why not vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wallace ca n't . A third point : Texas Democrats are still cross-eyed from a stock scandal that has tainted the Governor , indicted several high-level Democratic officeholders , including House Speaker Gus Mutscher , and hangs around like a general pall , making for a throw-the-rascals-out undertow of still-indeterminate pull . However , one sour note for Mr. Nixon : There are 400,000 blacks in Texas who are expected to vote . Even now 95 percent of them can hardly wait to get to the polls to pull the lever for the Democrat , whoever he is . But even this considered , Mr. Nixon , after all those years of wishing vainly on a Lone Star , may finally see the wish come true .
