txt PENNY-ANTE gamblers in Illinois like their lottery game so much the state is thinking about giving them an additional one , with a higher-priced ticket and , presumably , higher returns . Lottery Supt. Ralph Batch said the new " overlay " game , as it 's known in the lottery business , might start next spring . Possible price for the new ticket would be $1 . The new game would be offered along with the present one , which would still command its 50-cent-a-ticket price with prizes ranging from $20 to $1 million . Players could buy the old 50-cent ticket , the new ticket , or both . Plans for the new game are still only in their infancy , tho , Batch said , and the amount of prizes to be awarded has not been determined .

Purchasers will get both the special ticket and the regular weekly ticket for the price of Ralph Batch one . The Trips to the Sun promotion , the Fall Windfall game that ended last week , and the possible $1 lottery are all aimed at hypoing ticket sales , Batch said . SALES HAVE averaged five million a week since the game began 19 weeks ago , Batch said Monday at a meeting of the state Lottery Control Board in the State of Illinois Building , 160 N. La Salle St. That rate is one million below Batch 's predictions in August .

A ticket that does n't win one week , might win the next , so players should hang onto all their Trips to the Sun tickets . ? Cash winners who qualify for the trip will add their names to a big plastic sphere in a special Jan. 30 drawing .
