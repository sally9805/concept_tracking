THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE other day , as we were reading that the figures on crime in the United States had gone up once again , we were reminded of a phrase that we had not heard for quite a while : law and order . We could clearly remember the time , not so very long ago , when we had heard about almost nothing else . Candidates for office , in particular , had been preoccupied with the subject . Each one had said that if he was not elected crime rates would rise . In Congress , one " tough " measure after another was passed , in many instances by overwhelming majorities . The measures included provisions for " no-knock " entry into private homes by the police , provisions for the " preventive detention " of certain criminal suspects , and other seemingly un-Constitutional measures . President Nixon promised to alter the complexion of the Supreme Court ; " soft-headed " justices were to he replaced by " strict constructionists . " The President also asserted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restoration of the death penalty for some offenses  --  a penalty that the Supreme Court had struck down only a few months earlier . The mood of the public grew panicky , too . We remember that in our city an atmosphere of fear --  almost of terror  --  developed . The streets emptied at night . People stopped going to the theatre , because they were afraid of being mugged on the way home . Our taxis came to he equipped with grimy transparent-plastic shields between the rider and the driver . But none of the measures taken by the politicians or anyone else worked All were false cures , as many of the men who proposed them and voted for them well knew even as they did so . Then , rather suddenly , in the months following Richard Nixon 's fall , the atmosphere changed . The scare words vanished from the lips of the politicians . The no-knock law was repealed . The theatres filled up again . But it was only the atmosphere that changed . As far as anyone has been able to tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime rate . In the last decade or so , a wave of fear swept over the nation and then subsided . Politicians , the press , and television took up the issue of crime for a few years and then dropped it . The spread of crime was a real and enduring affliction , but the campaign to cope with it turned out to he illusory and evanescent , and vanished like last year 's fad . What it left behind is what we see around us now : a collection of damaged institutions ; a deeper suspicion than ever among citi7ens that what they hear from public men has nothing at all to do with the conditions of their daily lives ; and a rising rate of crime . ? ? Rehearsal IN opera , the final dress rehearsal usually determines the success or failure of a new production . Music and staging have been " set , " and the only adjustments that remain are minor matters of timing and lighting . Since the dress rehearsal is the first time that all the people involved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their handiwork , the atmosphere crackles with tension , uncertainty , and , occasionally , distress . We attended the dress rehearsal of the Metropolitan 's sumptuous new " Boris Godunov " and can report that , despite a few technical hangups , it was clear when the final curtain rang down that this production would be a hit . We arrived in the auditorium a few minutes before II A.M. and took a seat next to Schuyler Chapin , the Met 's general manager , who provided a few historical details . " This is our first new ' Boris ' production since 1913 , " he said , " and the first to he sung completely in Russian . The original production was brought from Paris , conducted by Tnscanini , in the Rimski-Korsakov version , and sung in Indian . In the nineteen-fifties , we had a new orchestration of the Moussorgsky score , by Karol Rathaus ; the singers switched to English ; and the sets were repainted and filled out with bits from Moussorgsky 's Khovanshchina . ' Now we are going hack to the definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . The chorus , the extra chorus , and the principals have been working on Russian diction for six months . The only ex ? ception is Martti Talvela , our Boris , who speaks fluent Russian ; he comes from Karelia , on the Finnish-Russian border . " Mr. Chapin introduced us to George Cehanovsky , a cherubic eighty-twoyear-old baritone from what once was St. Petersburg , and explained that he functioned as the company 's Russian coach . " First , I make a transliteration a phonetic translation of the Russian text into the English alphabet , " said Mr. Cehanovsky . " That is printed beneath the English words in the score . Then I read each part with the soloists and the chorus , and have them repeat after me . When the diction is good , I make tapes , which everybody takes home and studies . In rehearsal , I sit out front and control the mistakes . " The lights dimmed , and the orchestra ( conducted by Thomas Schippers ) began to play Moussorgsky 's brooding introductory music as August Ever-ding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assistant director , and Rudolph Kuntner , the Met 's lighting expert , took their places at desks with lamps in the row behind us . Things went smoothly until the first set change , which moved the action from the massive white walls of the Novodievichy Monastery to the onion-domed churches and bell towers of a square in the Kremlin . As the first set slid off to the right behind a transparent curtain , the Kremlin set for the coronation scene moved halfway across the stage and stopped . Mr. Everding emitted a moan , Mr. Kuntner grabbed a phone to ask what was going on , and Miss Berkowitz looked up from her cue hook and said , " This is a disaster . " The orchestra continued to play ( we learned afterward that at the beginning of the scene Mr. Schippers had received a buzzer signal to proceed ) , the great Kremlin hells boomed through the house , and , after an anxious moment , the set moved on across the stage and settled into place . " Everybody 's late , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession  --  soldiers , boyars , and Boris himself , in a long white coat  --  dashed up the steps and through the arched gate of the Cathedral of the Assumption . Then Mr. Schippers , realizing that the singers could never catch up with the music , stopped the orchestra until Prince Shuisky emerged from the cathedral to deliver the opening line . " Bells ! " said Mr. Everding during the sudden silence . " 4t least , they could keep ringing the hells Phrbe , we try that change three times on Monday . If there is any more mechanical trouble , I go onstage and shoot myself . " During the second intermission , we wandered backstage and found Donald Gramm ( who plays Varlaam , an alcoholic monk ) , Robert Nagy ( Prince Shuiskv ) , and Lenus Carlson ( the boyar Shchelkalov ) eating sandwiches in a dressing room . We asked how the Russian diction was going , and discovered that two of the singers Mr. Gramm and Mr. Nagy  --  had sting roles in Russian before . Mr. Carlson , a newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cram course in Russian during the summer and had learned to conjugate verbs . " Remember , there are three kinds of Russian in this opera , " said Mr. Gramm , a handsome , silver-haired bass-baritone . " The monks sing Old Russian , or Church Russian , which means that we pronounce the all ' sounds as ' o . ' Bob and Lent 's , who are noblemen , sing the modern Russian of Pushkin . And I use soldiers ' slang when I sing the ballad about Ivan 's war with Kazan . " Next door , we found Martti Talvela , the six-foot-seven-inch Boris , wrapped in a blue bathrobe and stretched out on what looked like a very small couch . " There are many roles you can do with your intelligence , " he told us in a sonorous rumble . " But Boris has to he horn in you . You must have a special personality . I often think that maybe a good Boris is the beginning of a sickness . I try to show three aspects of his character : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czar who suddenly realizes what it means to possess absolute power ; and the haunted ruler who struggles to control his dreams and his people . " We congratulated Mr. Talvela on a splendid performance and moved on to the greenroom , where Mr. Everding , short , shaggy , and intense , was coaching Mignon Dunn ( the Polish Princess Marina ) and Harry Thcyard ( the pretender , Dimitri ) in some stage business , " Dare to move when Dimitri says he will conquer Russia for you , " said Mr. Everding , making a balletic half turn to the left with a calculating expression on his face . " It can be a very little movement , but you must react . Then you go down to his feet and come up with a big quiet over your face . You feel ' This is a man ! ' Think of me . " Miss Dunn , a statuesque mezzo-soprano , who looked magnificent in a red wig and a silver-and-blue brocade dress , gave a hoot of laughter and ran through the scene with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Everding . " I ) ownstage , upstage , " said Mr. Thcyard , kissing Miss Dunn on each cheek . Mr. Everding pulled the lovers apart , and told them to hold . hands and smile triumphantly at each other . " You have both won , " he said . " Thenarrrragh ! ? you take her like a wild beast ! " He grabbed Miss Dunn in a bear hug that bent her stiff dress slightly out of shape . When Mr. Everding had finished with the singers , we asked him to tell us something about his approach to " Boris . " " it must he realistic , but without realistic sets , " he said , " and the action must flow continuously , which is why we have those dangerous set changes . I chose Ming Cho Lee as the designer because he is very good at making skeletons that hint at places and situations . He knows how to abbreviate , and I know how to fill up a stage . We finish not with the death of Boris  --  the conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary army coming from Poland . This is because the Russian pee , * play a crucial role in this opera . In the first scene , they are hired supers forced by the police to beg Boris to become Czar . In the coronation scene , they are a blind mob following a Fiihrer who promises them bread and circuses --  something the real Boris did to stay in power . In the scene outside St. Basil 's Church , the people are starving and becoming desperate . Then , in the final , Kromy Forest scene , they turn into a revolutionary mob , totally out of control , and they march off to Moscow with Dimitri . " We returned to the auditorium with Mr. Everding and asked him where he planned to station himself on opening night . " Nowhere , " he said . " I come before and give everybody greetings , and I come again for the bows . If I am in the house and something terrible happens , I would sit and think , Are you crazy to work all these months for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and scream . St- ) on my opening nights I always stay home . " Forty Years On THE only people we knew at the recent fortieth-birthday champagne gala of the Wine and Food Society of New York , at the Rainbow Room which has also just turned forty  --  were the old curmudgeon and a beautiful young therapist named Elaine Candle ) . Weil , there was also a good-looking woman in Mack who told us we looked familiar , but it turned out we bore a close resemblance to her father as a younger man . She came over when we were eating our way through some hors d'oeuvres collected from the buffet by the curmnudge- PPE : - " Please , Edgar ! Everyone 's staring ! " ? ? Peking duck , chicken-liver pate , Indonesian pork sates , and ballotine of pheasant with persimmon sauce  --  and washing them down with one of thirteen champagnes on hand . " I 'm sorry that I 'm not familiar , " the curmudgeon told the woman in black . The hors d'oeuvres were the work of student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Community College , in Brooklyn , and the Culinary Institute of America , in Hyde Park . The curmudgeon talked with Fritz Snnnenschmidt , an instructional coOrdinator at the Culinary Institute , and was delighted to discover that the school has fourteen hundred students . He said he hoped they would soon be sent out to do missionary work in the provinces . Elaine Cariello arrived late , in a peach outfit trimmed with champagne lace . She explained that she had gone to Bloomingdale 's that afternoon and bought a new long black dress for the party , but when she got home and put it on she had decided she looked as if she were dressed for a funeral , so she had hopped in a cab and gone back to Bloomie 's and bought the peach outfit . The curmudgeon was wearing a dinner jacket , as were all the other gents in the room , except for one young fellow squeezed into his father 's old tailcoat , which first saw service during the first year of the Rainbow Room . The curmudgeon had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Food Society people turn up on time for parties and get right to work on the food . Forty birthday cakes , baked for the gala by forty New York honlangers , were on display on the Way in to dinner . There was a huge nut roll from The Ginger Man , a cake with what looked like a pigeon on it from the Top of the Park , a sort of royal barge From the Cafj Argenteuil , a pyramid of honbons from Barbetta , and chocolate arabesques from Greenberg 's . The kids from the New York City Community College had baked a green cake with a champagne bottle standing in the middle of it . When we sat down to dinner , the re were fifty-four wineglasses on the table  --  six glasses to a person , nine people at the table . One of the people was Joseph Baum , the man who had created the dinner . He is a former Restaurant Associate , and hr is going to run all the new restaurants at the World Trade Center . Also at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's franchises , We ate bisque Nantua with Breaux Bridge crayfish ( the first of the season , Joseph Baum said ) ; braised noisette of veal with timbale of watercress and avorio rice ; and truffled quail Andn ' : Simon , named after the founder of the Wine and Food Society , a man who once said , " I owe so much to wine  --  my bodily and mental fitness . " Elaine examined her napldn ring very carefully . We asked her whet slue was doing . " Just exploring my environment , " she said . " Like any three-year-old . " The curmudgeon was particularly impressed by the fact that the waiters all had white cotton gloves on , and explained that that was traditional in Europe , and also that the conductors and ticket takers on crack Japanese express trains always wear white gloves . There was a dance band playing songs from the twenties and thirties , which pleased Elaine , because she said she had just been listening to all her old Lester Lanin records . And there was entertainment by officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snoozed through . Our table got to eat the Barbetta tower of confectionery , and the table was soon surrounded by Dine and 26 JANUARY ( 4,1 9 7 5 Fooders from other tables , who said , " You really ought to give us the rest of your cake , you know . Everybody 's sharing . " After dinner , Joseph Baum offered the curmudge a glass of rare brandy . " No , thank you , " said the o.c , " After dinner , I list to port . " Daytime Dancing IT 'S too had that more people do n't go dancing during the day . It 's cheaper than squash , more fun than duckpin bowling , and less humiliating than crashing cocktail parties . A lot of the people who now take their exercise on escalators would be improved by vigorous daytime dancing . There are some kinds of daytime dancing that are always available . There are taxi-dancing places that open before breakfast , and there are patches of sidewalk ( outside record stores ) where the dancing never stops . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other day , however , we came by a vigorous tea dance . It was held in the Carlyle by Peter Sharp , who owns the Carlyle , and Ahmet Ertegain , chairman of Atlantic Records , in honor of Robert Short , the well-bred singer . Lester Lanin 's orchestra played . Lester Lanin himself conducted the orchestra . Mr. Lanin is one of those men for whom the word " sprightly " was invented . We conferred with Mr. Lanin about the status of daytime dancing . " Well , we 've recently played at a number of tea dances in Toledo and Akron , " he said . " They still call them this dansants out there . We used to play so many . Now it 's only in the Middle West . " We ran into a striking girl with frizzled hair , who said she was having a good time and would n't leave the dance floor , " I mean , " she said , " I went to all those schools . I was miserahte for all those years , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , I mean , how many times do you get to do it anymore ? " This young lady told us that she thought dancing during the day was wonderful and " very sexy " which was a good thing , because New York was getting " very unsexy . " " Where are all the men in New York ? " the girl with frizzled hair asked . " I mean , at least there are men here to dance with . It 's very exciting . " We talked with the wife of a well-known senator , who said that she had n't danced in the afternoon since she took the subway in from Brooklyn to dance at the Biltrnort . Then we asked Earl McGrath , who works for Atlantic Records , when the last time he had danced in the daytime was . " Yesterday afternoon , " said Mr. McGrath . " At the Tango Palace . Fortyeighth Street and Broadway . " We talked with a man who lived in Cambridge , and who told us that there had been ballroom dancing in Dunster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Atlantic Records , who told us that one reason Lester Lanin was sounding so good was that Ray Nance , who played violin and trumpet with Duke Ellington , and the trombonist Big Chief Russell Moore were in his hand . We told Nesubi Ertegun that they were still holding this ( towards in Toledo and Akron . " That is where the good traditions remain , " he said . After hours and hours of vigorous daytime dancing ( and a little tea ) , we left the Carlyle . On the way out , we noticed Sly Stone , the important black singer , who had n't danced once , and we noticed Alice Faye . We asked Miss Faye when she had last been to a tea dance . " I 've never been to a tea dance before , " Alice Faye said . " This is my first tea dance . " ? ALSO , we have a report from our young friend Jamaica Kincaid : Every Friday , from noon to three o'clock , the young , upward-mobile , fun-loving , always-on-the-go set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &jue; at 57 West Fifty-seventh Street . Now , there are a few cultural traits that black people may to deny ( why , I 'll never know ) , but there are that they just ca n't escape . For instance , they ca n't deny that they know how to make dancing music better than anyone else , that they give better parties than anyone else , that they are better at dancing spontaneously than anyone else . The spirit of these three things makes a successful discothque , and black discothil.ques are better than anyone else 's . I visited La Martinique a couple of Fridays ago , and here are some of the things I noticed about the place . La Iltartinique is a very welcoming discoth-eque . It has real-wood chairs at small fake-marble-topped tables , soft lighting , a large dance floor that always seems freshly sanded , a bar where you will get good Screwdrivers ( and it would be wise not to have anything but ) , and a cigarette machine that charges seventy-five cents for a pack TIlE NEW YOR KER of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Martinique becomes a regular discotheque , and the people who are responsible for the evening entertainment are not the same people who put on the lunchtime dancing affair . The people responsible for the lunchtime dancing are Pjay Jackson , a secretary with an advertising agency ; Roni Boyette ; and Marvin Gathers . Pjay and the two men have a corporation that they call The Open Nose Production . It 's funny name hut not unusual . It seems that whenever two or more black people go into the disco-party business in New York they give themselves names like A Nautilus Production or A Critical Path Production or The Winston Collection . Usually , at a disco party given by any one of the groups mentioned above , you are expressly forbidden to wear blacjeans , sneakers , or any other kind of clothing that will make you look poverty-stricken . Here are some of the things I noticed about the people at La Martinique : The people who go dancing there at lunch offer a special look at a new class of black people . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a polyester fabric , wear moderatel high-heeled shoes , have their hair styled in a small , neat Afro , smoke Konl or Pall Mall cigarettes , anti never say to a young lady , " Hey , sugah , what you doin ' ? " Clarence McDade , a sales representative for DHJ Industries , at 1345 Sixth Avenue , is a good example of this . He was wearing a maroon suit that was sedate in cut and fit . He said about dancing at lunchtime at La Martinique , " I come here on Fridays because it 's a way of letting off tensions . The setup is nice , the crowd is nice , most of the men are junior executives , like myself . When I go dancing in the evening , I usually patronize places like Leviticus , Gatsby 's , and Nemo 's , but every Friday I come here . " The women look something like this : pants suits or stylishly cut dresses made from another kind of polyester fabric , six-inch wedge platform shoes , plastic jewelry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dixie Peach Bergamot , a perfumed hairdressing pomade . This genre of black-female grooming has two things going for it : it is constantly pushed in the magazine Essence , and it is often marketed under the heading " Easy Elegance . " Dancing at lunchtime at La Martinique is reasonably priced . Not only will two-fifty allow you to dance but it will also entitle you to a lunch of cold cuts , salad , and fruit . The music . is n't the top of black pop that you hear in most white discotheques . All the time I was there , I did n't hear my favorite song , " Kung Fu Fighting . " The music that Ray , the resident d.j. , is most fond of is long album cuts by B. T. Express , MFSB , Brian Auger , Mann Dibango , Hot Chocolate , The Bar-Kars , and the Average White Band . There is one advantage to going dancing in the daytime , and Jimmy Jackson , who works at a post office somewhere in Brooklyn , pointed it out to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights , so it 's hard for me to get out , " he said . " This is just the right thing for me . " Actually , it 's just the right thing for everybodyr . This is not the first time I 've danced in the middle of the day on Friday When I was a little girl , in something like the equivalent of kindergarten , in the Caribbean , every Friday we got a longer recess period than on the other days of the week . Then some of us would gather at one end of the schoolyard , grab each other around the waist , and start dancing up and down while we chanted " Tee la la Ia , congo . " Fee la la la , congo . " We did n't know what it meant , hut we would chant it over and over again until the end of the recess . I liked Fridays just for that . It was the one time I was free to he sweaty and have fun . also liked it because , according to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we called Muddy Bottom ' fanner behind her hack  --  our he ha vior was becoming only tih savages . How I did want to he a little savage ! I bet they never had to take cod-liver oil every day , or eat porridge in the mornings , or wear cotton anklets when all the other girls were wearing nylon anklets . And , after not having to do any of that , they probably got to " Tee la la la " every day for as lung as they liked . Mrs. Tanner would not understand or approve of lunchtime dancing at La Martinique .
