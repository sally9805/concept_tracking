The Aquatic , a noisy , diesel-driven 40-ft. private sub tender chugs out of Warwick Cove into a gray Rhode Island day . Past rows of boats with names like Many-Ha-Ha 's , Daddy 's Girl , Lucy M and Gyp Sea . Past a dock where burlap sacks of clams are bought and sold - the seller getting 55 per lb. for littlenecks , as high as 80 for big quahogs . Past a sandbar where a tourist drowned yesterday clamming in 3 ft. of water . Past the big shingled mansions that trim the shoreline at fashionable Warwick Neck . And so into Narragansett Bay , a body of water variously ravished by long-handled rakes , progress and history . <P> Just up the bay at Gaspee Point , Rhode Islanders each year burn a vessel in effigy to celebrate the burning , in 1772 , of the revenue schooner Gaspee , an early warning about Yankee distaste for King and custom 's duties . Last year the rusty old fishing boat Dorchester turned up in the bay with six tons of marijuana hidden aboard , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide that narcotics agents have yet to unravel . Westward , the old naval air station at Quonset Point is now the sprawling headquarters for oil-drill teams working the Baltimore Canyon . <P> It is perfectly fitting , then , that Warwick Cove is the only place in the world where the man who has everything can get lessons in how to handle America 's latest aquatic tool ( or toy ) . Sitting on a special launching ramp at the back end of Aquatic , the machine in question suggests a curious cross between a wind-up bathtub toy and a James Bond movie . It is a lemon-hued , one-man submarine , the S 250 , a 12-ft. - long , 2,250-lb. vessel that can be run by just about anybody , dive safely to 250 ft. , stay submerged for an hour at a time and costs ( at $12,000 without extras ) less than a Cadillac Seville . The man to see about lessons in the S 250 is Harold Jacobson , a balding but still visibly ginger-haired professional diver based in Warwick . He got the sub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired Navy sub commander who produces the world 's only line of cheap simple-to-operate baby subs in Warren , Me . Last summer Kittredge did the teaching himself . But the success of his subs took so much of his time that this year he turned the schooling over to Jacobson . <P> Undersea exploration and oil searches go on apace . Oceanographers , environ mental experts and futurists freely predict that man will not only soon put vast tracts of seabed under cultivation but may eventually be commuting back and forth to shallow , Atlantis-like undersea apartment clusters . It is tempting to see the baby sub not just as a prototype toy for the rich in Florida and California but as a seagoing Model T Ford , a future flivver of the deep , or like the Curtiss Jenny biplane , some kind of ur-machine that may usher in a new age of travel . In that perspective Kittredge and Jacobson , like early aviation nuts who paid for their rickety planes by giving flying lessons or built them on a financial shoestring in barns and attics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that history will catch up with their private enthusiasm .
