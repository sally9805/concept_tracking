txt Will the economic slowdown , now worldwide in scope , deepen into another recession among industrial nations ? Most economists think not ? if the economic giants , the United States . Japan , and West Germany ? gun the engines of their economies to build new trade momentum around the world . The danger in such a course is that inflation , running close to 6 percent in the U.S. , 9.5 percent in Japan , and nearly 4 percent in West Germany , would heat up if too much stimulus were applied . Current economic growth rates , on the other hand , are too slow to bring down unemployment levels , still dangerously high in many countries of the world . A faster growth rate among the giants , the argument goes , would open up their markets to more goods from smaller nations , whose economies are struggling . Meanwhile , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , scrapping earlier growth estimates , is revising growth projections downward for its 24 industrial members . The collective growth rate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second half of 1976 , says the OECD , may be only 3.5 percent , down from last July 's estimate of 4.5 percent . Stoking the economy to heat up world trade , but risking inflation , joblessnes // From page 1 *Forestalling world slump poses dilemma The United States , if it continued at its current annual growth rate of only about 4 percent , could not whittle down its unemployment .

Japan has only a 1.8 percent unemployment rate and Austria is doing even better , with 1.2 percent of its labor force out of work . But most nations of the OECD are not so well off .

As recently as October , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , meeting at Manila , called inflation the " common thread " running through national and international economic problems and leading , among other things , to higher unemployment . " There is , " said IMF managing director H. Johannes Witteveen , " a clear and general view that the path to sustainable economic growth and to the reduction of unemployment lies in . . . the restoration of a reasonable degree of price stability . " This echoed the conclusion of an economic summit meeting of major powers in Puerto Rico last June , which called fora brake on economic growth rates , lest inflation be reignited . Spurring this cautionary view was the United States , the most influential member of the OECD and IMF . The chief sponsor of U.S. anti-inflationary policy is Treasury Secretary William E.
