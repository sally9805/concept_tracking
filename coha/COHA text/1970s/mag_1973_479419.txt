THE UNFORGIVABLE FLAW in Don- aid Barthelme 's work is that he is right . He has located the square on which we are cowering , and he has assembled the comedy of our activities on that square , our lives , into an instrument of discomfort . He is the most monstrous writer alive , meaner than llawkes , nastier than Pynchon , more unfair than Beckett , less forgiving than Ionesco , as cruel as life . He shrieks when he laughs . He hates dogs and children . Saints can not convince him . Neither thick beers nor rich whiskeys satisfy him . He knows too much . If we were not dismembered , unable to control or even to find our parts , we would be able to defend ourselves . We would bind him with cash , gag him with celebrity , and be safe . They say he merely writes his dreams . And of course , they are wrong ; it is his plan to embarrass , he would not have it any other way . The man is vicious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel joke . Let us call it distortion , dislocation , sickness ; how does lie dare to say this trash is of our own making ? Let 's get together and accuse him of . . . of what ? Well , any man who thinks Snow ' White is a bored and promiscuous woman must be hallucinating . Why should we be made to squirm ? Perhaps he loves us ? It will take a complex argument to answer in the affirmative , but there are intimations , particularly in Sadness , the new collection of his stories . Some of the people in those stories are so thoroughly invented that we perceive them as failing to endure ordinary lives , like us . Our location in these stories is different . We are no longer awash in lists of waste , foolishness , and evil ; the characters guide us into the world . Sadness is truly the motif , our own lives are foreshadowed , such little tragedies ; is there a lower limit to sig-nificance ? The answer is the achievement in Barthelme 's stories ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . He presents everything as human work ( ersatz buffalo humps , a lady trumpet player named for a typeface , a surrogate self . King Kong ) , and by inspecting these bizarre and absurd works he gives them a certain validity ? they exist , something has happened , which is better than nothing . " There are always openings , " he concludes , " if you can find them . There is always something to do . " But what ? If the world is a pastiche of junk , if dogs fall on our heads , children piss in our beds , and Paul Klee is a slyly incompetent baby-sitter for warplanes , if the repeated playing of the Star-Spangled Banner on a personal radio station is the only resolution we can know , what shall we do ? Fortunately , artists do not seek political office , neither do they sell pana ? ceas to the au courant ; the work of the artist is to make a world that deflates the world we know , to create surpassing experience . Barthclme , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into beautiful language ; he is often a poet , lie makes sculptures of words ; art is alchemy . At other times , he is Barthelme the pasticheur , which is not to say that the work fails , but to identify it as another form , a form originated by Donald Barthelme and not borrowed from either the surrealist poets or Kafka . His pastiches are environmental , related to that form in the plastic arts more than to previous writing . They are made of the sour notes of life , as is the music of Varese , Cage , and the new composers who find their voices in electric machines . To read his pastiche stories or his novel Snow White is to be suddenly defenseless in the world , disarmed of the deafness , blindness , and insensitivity that insulate and preserve us . The work is not fantastic , but unbearably real , drawn straight from life , fiction made in a form not unlike Eisenstein 's conception of montage , but in a world filled with dislocations and absurdities that Eisenstein could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the world we survive but to the world as it is . Donald Barthelme has accomplished the work that the New Journalists are not competent to do . In a single story he is able to include more of the taste of the times than there is in the collected works of Wolfe . Breslin , Talese Co . The difference lies in Barthelme 's ability to compress , almost to transistorize the world , and then to make his miniatures real again by virtue of his talent for language . He is truly the writer of this time , pressing the flower of technology in a book . He cuts , dissolves , Ries in jet planes , televises , telescopes , miniaturizes , codes , moves at the speed of electricity to the moon , the Pedernales , the movies , the operating room , the radio station , sometimes in his own voice and sometimes in the language of Joyce , Eliot , Beckett . Castro , or John Wayne . He presses a button and calls up words and ideas from his time machine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together into an iron maiden and closes that terrible door on us . The spikes pierce our skin at the height of our laughter . PTIHE EFFECT of the pastiche in Bar- thelme'ss stories is to remind us of dream material , and the effect is heightened in many cases by the tone of the narration ; tense , concise , straining to be accurate about the past , to avoid contaminating the past by responding to it in the prose . Here are two examples of that tone : Ire fear the arrival of enemy warships , for we are in a state of war . Herr P. intends to leave the castle ; he gives me instructions as to what must be done if what we fear should come to pass . His sick wife and his children are in the threatened castle . As soon as the bombardment begins , the large hall is to be cleared . He breathes heavily , and tries to get away : I detain him , and ask him how I am to send him news in case of need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor dead . I have probably taxed him unnecessarily with my questions . His driver 's license expires . But he does nothing about renewing it . He is vaguely troubled by the thought of the expired license ( although he does not stop driving ) . But he loathes the idea of taking the examination again , of going physically to the examining station , of waiting in line for an examiner . He decides that if he writes a letter to the License Bureau requesting a new license , the bureau will grant him one without an examination , because he is a genius . He is right . He writes the letter and the License Bureau sends him a new license , by return mail . The second example , from Barthelme 's story " The Genius , " is the more worldly . Its comedy derives from our perception of a social situation . that of the extraordinary man in America . It is a better paragraph in terms of fiction because it uses character to make the comedy . The first example , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man dying of questions in the middle of a naval bombardment ? assumes that we know both the narrator and Herr P. While the tone seems on first reading to be quite similar , closer inspeeLion reveals that the first example is far more abstract ; it is a blueprint for a fiction perhaps , but not yet fiction . Both paragraphs are concise , neither has a single metaphor ; it is a style in which the narrator does not seem to intrude upon the material . Yet the first example is incomplete and the second is a very skillfully worked fiction , one in which everything we need to know is provided by the narrator . Freud , who is relating one of his own dreams in the first example , had no need to make his narration complete ; he was able to explain the paragraph in the analysis of the dream that he wrote in succeeding paragraphs . There is a logic of dreams and a logic of art ; the difference is that the logic of art must he contained within the work of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . Freud 's dream is intensely personal , incomprehensible except for the absurdity at the end , which we understand as funny only in an abstract way ; it is surreal . Ilarthelme 's paragraph takes place in the world ; its success depends upon our general knowledge of the society in which the genius lives . It is an illumination of that society , social criticism if you like , and social surrealism is impossible . B ARTHELMF . ' S WORK is original even though the material is often taken very directly from life , for the forms are his . He shifts from place to place , but the vantage point is always one on which no one has stood before . One imagines him skulking in the streets , salons , subways , schoolrooms , surgeries , sepulchres , saloons , and sanctuaries of cities , snipping off little pieces here and there , then going to a room decorated with typefaces and steel engravings to assemble the universal miniatures that disquiet the dreams of his readers . He speaks of his method often hi his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Oh 1 wish there were some words in the world that were not the words 1 always hear . " " How long is it ? " we asked . " Four pages , " she said , " at present . " " Four pages ! " The thought of this immense work .. . " . it is no wonder we are all going round the bend with this language dinning forever into our eyes and ears .. . " We like books that have a lot of dreck in them , matter which presents itself as not wholly relevant ( or indeed , at all relevant ) but which , carefully attended to , can supply a kind of " sense " of what is going on . This " sense " is not to be obtained by reading between the lines ( for there is nothing there , in those white spaces ) but by reading the lines themselves --  -- -looking at them and so arriving at a feeling not of satisfaction exactly , that is too much to expect , but of having read them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set piece in Snow White about the manufacturing and marketing of plastic buffalo humps , the making of trash , which leads Barthelme to write , " . . . the question turns from a question of disposing of this ' trash ' to a question of appreciating its qualities ... " And then , " It 's that we want to he on the leading edge of this trash phenomenon , the everted sphere of the future , and that 's why we pay particular attention , too , to those aspects of language that may be seen as a model of the trash phenomenon . " Why lumps , one wonders , as a choice for trash ? Later in the book , which was published in 1967 , the meaning of the humps is extended and clarified : " . . . one does n't want to come home and hear a lot of hump from a cow-hearted leader whose leadership buttons have fallen off ... " The hump , of course , leads us now to think of Hubert Humphrey ; the buffalo were the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash is attached to war , greed , destruction , the deepest failings of Western civilization , and it is also given a place in the literature . Nothing is hidden , there are no tricks ; it is all there , as Barthelme says , " in the lines themselves . " He is examining the society by examining the language . Wittgenstein has told us the linkage is inevitable . With his snips of the world . Barthelme makes the 94 examination into fiction horn of the conscious linking of language and society . By reading the fiction , the lines , we participate in the examination , we experience the world differently , and we are changed , or at least embarrassed , by our reading . Q : What do you consider the most important tool of the genius of today ? A : Rubber cement . So Barthelme 's genius answers the abstract interviewer . Of course he is a pasticheur . More than that , his work is a kind of junk sculpture . It is mostly comedy rather than wit , if we accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comical is found ; it is found first of all in persons , and only later by transference may be seen also in objects , situations , and the like . " There is wit too in Barthelme 's stories , but always in combination with comedy . The one thing that is missing is humor , which Freud says results from " an economy of expenditure in feeling , " most often unpleasant feeling . In one of Freud 's examples , the man on the gallows who makes a hu morous gesture spares himself the feeling of terror or pain . Neither Barthelme 's characters nor his readers are ever spared any pain . He gives no quarter , he presents the worst of all possible words . He does not even allow us , as readers , to be the comfortable third-person observers in the comic situations , for his characters mirror so closely our own innards and edges that their failures become ours , their dreek is of our own making . T IS A TERRIBLE LITANY Donald BarI thehne has made , grinding out our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immorality , programmed to produce congeries of monstrosities , many of them even illustrated . Is he a miserable man , a misanthrope , setting out to hurt us , to poison everything , including our laughter ? Will he be content only when we are dead or mad ? One could ask the same questions of any Saturday Night Preacher spewing out hellfire and damnation in a steamy tent in Tennessee or Oklahoma . One could ask the same questions of Mark Twain . The forms and the language are new , this being the time of the new , but Barthelme is solidly in the American tradition ; the work is moral , the work is bitching , he has the artist 's faith that this world is neither the best nor the only world men can make . There is a sense of hopelessness in his work , of a world too distracted to be comprehended , of the center having come apart , but such literature is not new in this century . Cams has helped us to understand it : " Even if the novel describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of salvation . To talk of despair is to conquer it . Despairing literature is a contradiction in terms . " There are moments hi Barthelme 's stories when we come as close to despairing for him as for ourselves . He is apparently unable to resist had jokes . They spot the stories like a pox . And there are times , as in his story about a midget President of the United States , when he seems to have succumbed to the disease . His parodies are like all parodies , lacking in originality . His experiments do not always succeed : numbered sentences are not more but less interesting than sentences without numbers , typographical devices do not change words , and his illustrations are most often ordinary . If a reader were to choose from Barthelme 's stories at random and have luck go against him , he might very well come away thinking he had encountered a writer who had dissipated his talent and even his vision by his lack of discipline , for Barthelme 's forms are dangerous ? they hover at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With good luck , a reader might open to the first paragraph of " The Indian Uprising " : We defended the city as best we could . The arrows of the Comanches came in clouds . The war clubs of the Comanches clattered on the soft , yellow pavements . There were earthworks along the Boulevard Mark Clark and the hedges had been laced with sparkling wire . People were trying to understand . I spoke to Sylvia . " Do you think this is a good lifer The table held apples , books , long-playing records . She looked up . " No . " Can more be asked of a paragraph ? If we reflect on it , we can find the entire history of America , from the slaughter of the Indians to the present slaughter in Vietnam . The table holds the best production of the society of slaughterers , those who are , in Barthelme 's irony , defending themselves against the Comanches. but the apples , books , and long-playing records are not enough ; riches , art , and technology are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be negative . It is not news , of course , but it is art . The compression is brilliant . We experience anew our own history in a moment of such intensity that we are forced to find a new way to deal with it or to fail to deal with it . IN THE NEW COLLECTION , Sadness , 1 the stories are structured in most cases to give us a better defined point of entrance than Barthelnae had offered before . The writing is more affecting , the pose of the en/ant terrible that undermined some of the earlier stories is gone , Sadness is the work of a writer in the bloom of maturity ? the flower is dark and made of rutting angles , streaked with laughter , a strangely natural collage of unforgettable surfaces . " Critique de la Vie Quotidienne " is narrated by a man who is cursed with a fashionable wife and a witty child . " Our evenings lacked promise , " says the narrator . " The world in the evening seems fraught with the absence of promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do but go home and drink your nine drinks and forget about it . " " The Temptation of St. Anthony " places the saint in an American city and tells us that " St. Anthony 's major temptation , in terms of his living here , was perhaps this : ordinary life . " In " The Party " King Kong appears among the guests , and the narrator later asks his companion , " Dear Francesca , tell me , is this a successful party , in your view ? Is this the best we can do ? I know that you have always wanted to meet Kong ; now that you have met him and he has said whatever he has said to you ( I saw you smiling ) , can we go home ? " The woman in " Perpetua " ( one can hardly call her the heroine ) leaves her husband , has a series of uninspired failures , yet when her husband asks her if she is happy now that she has left him , she answers , " Sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhappiness , pettiness , foolishness . But not defeat . With rubber cement and an original intelligence , Donald Barthelme transcends this world and , by his art , gives us the strength to lodge one more complaint
