When they killed the first shark and cut it open to see whether it was the one eating bathers , they found a Louisiana license plate . " Lord , " I thought , " I do n't want to mess with something that would eat a Louisiana license plate . " // But that was nothing . By the time they located the right shark and killed it , thereby saving the tourist trade of the New England town off whose shore it had been chomping , it had eaten four extras , a boathook , an aqualung tank , two considerable lengths of thick rope and Robert Shaw . I never believed anything would eat Robert Shaw . // It happens in Jaws , the new movie directed by Steven Spielberg and starring two rows of teeth " as big as shot glasses . " I was going to take notes in the theater but all I recorded was a quote from the Shaw character : " ... dead eyes . When he comes at you , he do n't seem to be living . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I looked down , my ballpoint pen had been bitten in two . I do n't know whether I did it , or the lady sitting next to me . It could n't have been the shark , which would n't have left anything except my leg . There is a very realistic leg turning slowly , slowly in the water , with a sneaker on it , after one of the shark 's attacks . But the best thing is the face in the bottom of the boat which is all that is ... no , I wo n't spoil it for you . // I have long been wary of sharks . Once I was in a small boat with one that was maybe 30 inches long , and I was never so glad to see anything as that fish finish whipping three people and snarling their rigs into one big tangle and managing to leap out of the boat . The shark in Jaws is 24 feet long . And , yes , it is a better actor than the whale in Moby Dick . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong . // And I bought it . The novel Jaws was so ungripping between shark scenes that I never even read all the shark scenes , and the more advance press I saw about the movie makers ' trials with their midget and their plastic shark , the more I prepared to scoff . And indeed Shaw 's performance , as the crazy grizzled fisherman Quint , is the only human one that amounts to much , and even Quint is what you might call farfetched ( the other major roles are Richard Dreyfuss playing a marine biologist and Roy Scheider a chief of police ) . Still , Jaws provides a brisk dose of gasps and shudders . It may not fill you with as much stark raving horror as you hope it will after all the reviews , but I think it will keep you bolt upright . Good exercise . // As to whether you ought to stop going out in the surf after this , well , you did n't stop prospecting for gold after Treasure of Sierra Madre did you ? Let 's keep things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that one , because the shark is not as interesting a character as Fred C. Dobbs or as frightening as Alfonso Bedoya , the " we do n't need no stinking bodges " bandit chief . The shark makes your skin want to run off and leave you , not crawl , and those dead eyes do n't stay with you very long . // But I 'll say this . Spielberg has announced he is going to make " a comedy where people will laugh so much that they 'll begin to throw up all over each other . " If he essays this film and you go to it , wear old clothes .
