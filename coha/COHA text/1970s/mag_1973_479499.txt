In 1958 , Jeb Stuart Magruder had , at Williams College , taken a course in Religion and Ethics . His teacher was the chaplain of the college , William Sloane Coffin , Ir . For several years afterward , they carried on a correspondence . In 1973 , the student , while on the witness stand before the Ervin Committee , spoke of his teacher . It was a rare , impassioned moment , during what hitherto had been cool , though slightly nervous , testimony . His teacher , he said , had , during an anti-war demonstration , violated the law . In explaining his own fall , he equated his lawlessness with his teacher 's . Coffin replied in a New York Times Op Ed piece . " I wasshocked to hear Jeb lump all lawbreakers together . He should have known . that many in the anti-war movement were protesting what they considered to be illegal laws , whose constitutionality could be tested only by a refusal to obey them . There is an enormous difference between trying to keep the nation under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a loyal servant to the Constitution and being a loyal servant only to the man who hires you . " We are in a Manhattan apartment : Jab Stuart Magruder , William Sloane Coffin , Ir. , and myself . There are sandwiches and beer . The conversation goes on for about four hours . MAGRUDER : Occasionally , people stare at me on the street as though to say : Your face is familiar . I 've seen you somewhere . Were you on television ? I 'm getting better tables at restaurants now . I guess that 's a true test of American values ( laughs ) . They sometimes ask for your autograph , particularly after the Senate hearing . There 's a lot of name recognition when T sign in at hotels . I do n't watch the hearings myself . But I talk to people who seemfascinated , not with the content , but just with the drama of the hearings . Today , on the shuttle coming up from Washington , a professor from the University of Michigan came up and asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things we may have engaged in . I said that I had gone through this before with Bill Coffin and had understood the difference all along , but I did think it was useful to say what I said at the Senate hearing . l thought it was important for people to understand how I felt . I 've always thought civil disobedience was a perfectly acceptable part of our system , a good part . But the anti-war people , especially during Mayday , did violent things . They were oriented toward chaos . If we had n't moved in and made mass arrests , there would have been a shutdown of the city by the demonstrators . There was a tremendous amount of violence . COFFIN : What 's a tremendous amount ? MAGRUDER : A lot of trashing . That 's not serious violence . But there was harassment of citizens , throwing rocks , breaking car windows , turning cars over . TERKEL : Do you think there might have been a provocateur or two in the crowd ? MAGRUDER : I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered by the violation of constitutional rights in the breakup on Sunday and the massive arrests on Monday ? MAGRUDER : It brings to mind the security measures that are occurring in Israel now . There may be an abuse of civil liberties because of the fear of terrorist attacks . COFFIN : You really feel Washington was besciged as Israel might be by Arab terrorists ? MAGRUDER : I do n't think it was quite that serious . But there certainly was a feeling of fear . COFFIN : You said I urged students to burn their draft cards . I did n't . MAGRUDER : Did n't you ? Well , I did give you name recognition ( laughs ) . TERKEL : Why did you take that course in Ethics ? MAGRUDER : I had some problems at the time . That 's how I got to know Bill . Not as a teacher , as a counselor . That 's why I took his Ethics course . I related very well to Bill . He seemed to understand . 60 COFFIN ; We were good friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil disobedience . I was just beginning to teach and I had n't caught on yet to the depth of complacency that would later make civil disobedience a widespread necessity . But I remember my frustration . Students were agreeing their way through life . They went to college to get accredited . This was blasphemy to me . It was a nice place , but it was n't a challenging place ? in the beautiful Berkshires , far removed from urban problems . MAGRUDER : You used to get upset because we were n't too excited about the key issues of the day . You gave a couple of strong sermons on the black issue . Did n't a guy empty a shotgun into your living room ? COFFIN : It was on account of what I said about fraternities . MAGRUDER : Oh , yeah ( laughs ) . I was a fraternity man , but by that time I did n't feel they were beneficial to the educational process . I was n't upset by the sermon . COFFIN : I found my old grade sheet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good B student , despite Bill 's C. TERKEL : Do you think grades are that important ? MAGRUDER : I do n't think they ever were . But I was working to get through school . I was on a scholarship . I had to borrow money from a bank ? which I just finished paying off last year . I had to keep a good B average to keep my scholarship . I could n't go to graduate school . I was broke . I did n't have any specialty . I could n't become a chemist or anything like that . So business was the natural thing . I had a considerable amount of experience while I was at Williams . T ran a student laundry , sold Vick 's Vapo Rub and Prince Matchabelli perfume . I just had to . During my growing up , we were not particularly affluent . We were middle-income . My father had run a small printing shop , but was never as successful as he 'd hoped to be . We lived a typical middle-class existence . Our values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job . The professors in the school were interested in trying to get us on to other things . But the student body tended to be quite satisfied with life as it was . You did n't have a broad choice . You went to law school , became a teacher , or entered business . I never thought of being a businessman . But after finishing Williams , it was the natural thing . I had majored in political science . Fred Schuman was my Honors professor . He was great . We never agreed , but he and I got along very well . My thesis was on Communist ideology . He was an expert on the Soviet Union . Fascinating man . He had a great influence on me . COFFIN : But he was a good deal to the left of you . MAGRUDER : When you have a good professor , you do n't have to agree with his view . You 're impressed by his knowledge . Schuman , like a good teacher should , imparted a knowledge that was broader than his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specific as to the kind of government we should have . I remember reading Henry Kissinger 's book in my senior year . It was one of the foremost books on nuclear weaponry . TERKEL : You were equally affected by Coffin , Schuman , and Kissinger . What a parlay ! MAGRUDER : They were highlights , all important . I had other courses that did n't affect me at all . I did a lot of reading when 1 was younger . I was a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's . In my high-school and early college days , I read every one of his books . I enjoyed them tremendously . Gatsby was quite a guy . It 's a sad story . I liked Daisy better than I liked Gatsby . She had a charm about her that struck me . I read a lot of books on the Civil War . 1 could qualify as an amateur historian . Our family came to Baltimore in 1659 and was on the Southern side . An ancestor , John Bankhcad Magruder , was a Confederate general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a child . I was active as a swimmer and played tennis . I was n't the best athlete on the block , but I was a good one . I did most of the things that kids do growing up . Nothing spectacular . I was popular in high school , made good grades , was elected to class offices . TERKEL : Did you ever do anything , at any time , that offended people in authority ? MAGRUDER : I had some instincts to rebel . I remember at Williams College driving my car over the lawn in a forbidden area . The dean got very upset . TERKEL : Did you ever have what some might call dangerous thoughts ? MAGRUDER : I 'm not really sure what dangerous thoughts are . I found that in the corporate life and in the government , it 's best to do what your superiors want ? as long as it 's within ethical and legal limits . I was very strong on that . I used to tell people who worked for me at the Committee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , that 's why you 're here . In the corporate life , you must conform or it can he very difficult . There were a couple of occasions during my business career where I did n't follow the prescription . This hurt . I had a couple of setbacks that would n't hare occurred if I had conformed . 1 was at Jewel Tea in Chicago and doing very well . I had been advertising and then merchandising manager of one of their divisions . When a job offer came from California , I took it . It was a mistake and I decided to go back to Jewel . They agreed . I changed my mind again . Jewel was very upset with me , and correctly so . After that I made up my mind : I 'd better toe the line for people employing me . COFFIN : It must have been quite a shock to discover your team was n't the team you thought it was ? Haldeman or Ehrlichman , taping your conversations , MAGRUDER : I must admit internally I was bothered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations without my knowledge . I was surprised . It was n't an adversary relationship . There was no need to tape . Other ihan that , I have n't been bothered by any of the accusations , charges and countercharges . I understand the process by which individuals defend their position . I feel very comfortable . It does n't bother me anymore what someone says , whether it 's a columnist or a commentator or a ... person . COFFIN : Do you accept that as part of the game ? Each one survives his own way , even though the guy may have been your buddy ? MAGRUDER : I do n't like it , but I accept it . My philosophy is : if you ca n't do anything about it , do n't worry about it . Internally it bothers me . After I finished Williams , I gained certain perspectives . I made things happen . I was able to accomplish more than many of the people in my class . It 's keeping me going now through this time of my greatest stress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember at Williams . MAGRUDER : I was just floating through Williams . Just taking things as they came , not getting too concerned . But afterward , I did . A lot of people that worked with me at the White Ilouse had a similar kind of aggressiveness , ambition . They were more interested in power than money , more interested in getting things done . Not just talking about them . I became one of these people when I finished Williams . I wanted to accomplish things , get things done . Not just for the sake of getting them done ? but there was something in that , too . I decided not to follow the path of my peers , to stay in business , move up the ladder and become the president of a company . The typical college graduate of the Fifties may now be running a small business in a large city or be the vice ? resident of a large corporation . I found I. more energy than my business was using up . I got involved in politics and was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 . He was n't a great favorite of mine at the time , but he was the better choice . Kennedy was just too flamboyant . I thought I was above that . I wanted a more solid man . Most of my peers were upper-middle-class college graduates who felt as I did . They felt Kennedy was too young to be President . We were somewhat disturbed by his charm , by his good looks . That bothered us more than his politics did . COFFIN : Were there no substantive issues ? MAGRUDER : There were basic principles ; individual initiative , the work ethic , a strong foreign policy , decentralization of the federal government . Politics was much more exciting than business . You 're working for a man instead of a product . Money alone was n't the secret of success . During my work at the White House , you had many well-to-do people coming to you asking for your guidance . Even though they had far more wealth than any of us . People would be catering to you . They were attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This helps explain Watergate , too , does n't it ? You told me Watergate was inevitable . You were disturbed by widespread business practices , the way America operates . MAGRUDER : I would never say the country caused Watergate . Specific individuals are to blame . But there are certain values , certain characteristics 0 and habits in this country a desire to get ahead , impatience . Our overwhelming legal structure creates in the average businessman , the average worker , a feeling that he has to do his share of shaving , whether it he on his income tax or on his expense account . Sometimes you just go along . There were decisions the President made that I did n't agree with . But since he was President and I was an aide , it was n't something I should do anything about . If you 're very much against a policy , you should resign . Once it 's made , you should go along . I stuck my neck out on one occasion . Election eve of 1970 we were going to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I indicated to Mr. Haldeman the tape was unacceptable . It was a very strident speech and there was a z z-z-z going through the middle of the tape . I said it would be a disaster . And it was . Muskie followed , sitting by the fireside up in Maine . It had a tremendous effect ou our attitude toward the ' 72 election . We became very concerned . The President dropped in popularity and Muskie rose . The first six months of ' 71 , we were running five to seven points behind Muskie in every Harris and Gallup poll . We did n't know at the time that China and Russia would work out perfectly for us . COFFIN : Was there any question of the war being a factor ? MAGRUDER ; That issue was in the hands of Henry Kissinger . The rest of the staff stayed out of it . Magruder 's Legal Status In a familiar ritual of the U.S. criminal justice system , Magruder has " copped a plea " in the Watergate case . By volunteering to testify for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal liability . Thus , in Washington on August 16 , Magruder pleaded guilty ( and waived trial ) to a one-count federal indictment charging him with conspiracy to obstruct justice , defraud the United States , and eavesdrop on the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate . Possible sentence : five years in prison and a $10,000 fine . Magruder 's fate could have been much bleaker . During the August proceedings , he freely admitted his participation , with other unnamed co-conspirators , in the following alleged criminal acts : ? Plotting the break-in at the Democratic headquarters . ? Buying equipment and hiring agents for the break-in . ? Bugging the Democratic National Committee . ? Impeding the Justice Department investigation by concealing the scope of the unlawful activities , influencing witnesses to give false testimony , hiding evidence , and giving misleading testimony . ? Giving false testimony to the FBI . That was a closed issue . COFFIN : What was your reaction to the invasion of Cambodia ? MAGRUDER : There were disagreements within the staff . But we all felt since we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policies the President set . You could disagree privately , but not publicly . COFFIN : Did that trouble you at all ? MAGRUDER : I subverted my personal feelings to what I felt was the President 's desire . I think that 's the root cause of Watergate . I remember the case of Ernest Fitzgerald . He was the man at the Pentagon who had been cost conscious . Clark Moilenhoff and I were the only two on the White House staff who were advocates of Mr. Fitzgerald 's position . We were overruled . I did n't agree with the position but I accepted it . COFFIN : Why was loyalty to the buss so important ? MAGRUDER : Kennedy 's men had the same sort of loyalty . Johnson 's aides did . The Presidency more than a corporation or a university breeds a certain necessity for loyalty . Personal loyalty to the man as against the office . At the university , you can sit and discuss alternatives . But if you 're working at the White House , you enjoy your job , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , you can leave and go somewhere else . But is it that important ? So you subvert individual judgment over here to gain a more effective policy over there . It 's the same thing in business . COFFIN : When you subvert your opinion , you are in effect subverting yourself . Your identity is at the mercy of the person to whom you 're loyal . Right ? MAGRUDER : That 's true . You ca n't work in any structured situation without having this subversion going ort on a daily basis . Most of the cases I can think of ? with the exception of the war ? were not great moral issues . They were practical issues . There certainly would have been a revulsion on my part if I thought the President was going to escalate the war and was not serious about a settlement . He did what he felt he had to du , and I think he did it well . I must admit I 've been disturbed polemic is necessary to get them to confront themselves . MAGRUDER : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . Much better than most people I know . You like it . COFFIN : ( Sighs ) Maybe the truth is confrontational . It 's the one thing we do n't confront with breathtaking regularity . MAGRUDER I could n't agree with you more . There was a good deal of deception going on within the Administration ? if what we read is to be believed . COFFIN What concerns me pastorally is that I sense in you a great need to be honest . But your capacity for honesty has been eroded by this experience . In the same way , many people sense a need to love , but have lost their capacity to love . These things gradually erode human beings so that they 're really not that deeply human anymore . What disturbs me most about Watergate is that the failure lay in being caught . It 's not the truth that has set people free . They 're still prisoners of their falsehood . It 's only that they were caught . There still has n't been a confrontation with the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the truth . COFFIN : Even here , one has a slight feeling that honesty pays . MAGRUDER : You 're trying to make a black ? and-white issue , It would be dishonest of me to say my honesty was 100 percent for pure reasons , right ? There are legal reasons . There 's my family . There 's the emotional problem of living a charade . The experience has in a way been beneficial . What the long-range effect will be is difficult to tell . COFFIN : The thing I 'm missing is what the nineteenth-century theologian Bushnell talked about : the expulsive power of a new affection . It 's a power that drives out the old affection . It 's the power of a new loyalty that drives out the old loyalty . Like every human being in the world , you had a longing for your place in the universe . We all need that . You found it . Now you 've lost it . But the new one has n't been found yet . There 's not a new loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's taking some time . You ca n't switch from here to there immediately . You ca n't take four years of my life and say it was all wrong . China and Russia came through beautifully . It would be a mistake for me all of a sudden to flip-flop from one extreme to another . I 've got to find out what I did right and continue to do that and realize what I did wrong and change that part of me . COFFIN : What you say is interesting . What you do n't say is even more interesting . You have n't said anything about the Administration and its concern ? or lack of it forthe poor , for the blacks , for the dispossessed . You mention Russia and China coming through beautifully . Power sw-eethearting power . That can be a vicious thing . Increasingly , powerful nations are coming together to lord it over the powerless . If I were to impeach Nixon , it would be for Cambodia rather than Watergate . Power can destroy an individual 's capacity to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who are in desperate need . I think your experience eroded those qualities which you had while you were at Williams . You just had a bad experience , and it will take a long time to recover what it has cost you in terms of your humanity . MAGRUDER : I 'm going to try to change my lifestyle . I 'll probably try to teach . I 'd like to teach Government . I think it could be invaluable to the students because I was there and I knew what it was . Most people teaching Government are removed from it and are not aware what the government is really like . I think it 's impossible to change one 's view without taking the time to examine what it really is . I have n't done that yet . The last twenty years all l 've done is kept moving up the ladder , working very hard to make sure 1 was going up that ladder . Now I finally have some time to go inside me. to find out why 1 did certain things . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought just like that . I think much of what the Administration did is beneficial . Some of our policies had purely political bases . We did n't spend time on the disadvantaged for the simple reason that there were no votes there , That 's not a good reason . But . for the most part , our policiff , were based on deeply held beliefs . We tried to break down the bureaucracy as an overgrown instrument of totalitarianism . We do n't have a democracy of the peoplenow . We have a specialinterest democracy . We have the auto lobby , the oil lobby . The individual has no way of appealing to tile government . The true democracy is where the individual is able to affect his own situation . That is not true in this country anymore . The big lobbies can do it , but the individual ca n't . People feel they have no influence . So if you do n't feel you have any interest , you do n't worry about it . You just go along . TERKEL : When you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitaph might read : He was easy to get along with . MAGRUDER ( Laughs ) That 's true . That 's what Bill said about me . TERKEL : I did n't mean that as a perjorative phrase . There are possibilities .. . COFFIN : It can he turned to the good . " He 's easy to get along with " has been your way of just sliding around . Now it can be a good way of communication because more people can relate to your experience than they can , say , to Dan Berrigan 's . It may be easier for them to learn through you . To be Jeb is terribly valuable at this moment . His experience has been an all-American one . His change could be an All-American one . We 're not naturally profound . We usually have to he forced down , forced by failure . In my own life , I 've learned far more from my failures than I have from my successes . H Jeb can confront these failures with honesty , it will be healthy for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The slippage and sliding and shaving and loyalties that are too small and the need to be on the team if all this gets examined and put before the American public , it can be terribly useful . The greatest tragedy for Jeb would be to have the experience and miss the meaning . I 've relt for years it would be an extraordinary thing if some national leader went on television and said , " My fellow Americans , we 've made a great mistake . " It 's hard for most Americans to think it 's all right to have made a mistake . The possibilities of Americans seeing themselves in the life and times of Jeb Magruder could be very helpful . MAGRUDER : Well , I think it would be a greater tragedy than the Watergate affair itself if people did n't learn from our experience .
