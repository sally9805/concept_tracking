 | gardens . To fight them now , with no reason , would be infamous , and our warriors would go into battle knowing that the gods could not be with them . ' His logic was rejected not only by the council of chiefs but also by the common warriors , who felt that for a Susquehannock to pass more than a year in peace would be disgraceful . If their great river had proved an excellent place to live , it must be because their tribe had always fought to protect it , and an old warrior predicted , Pentaquod , when the day comes that we are afraid to fight , we lose the river . ' He persisted in talking against a meaningless war , and since any who spoke for peace in the lands along this river would always be charged with treason , his opponents started the rumor that he had been contaminated by the enemy and served as their spokesman . It was recalled that his wife had died young , which increased the likelihood that the gods rejected his arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was one of the tallest Susquehannocks in a generation , and they were a tribe of giants . Towering above young men his age , he looked with steady gaze from his great , broad face , darker in color than normal , sure sign of a warrior . This contradiction perplexed children who listened to the accusations against him , and they began to mimic his diffident walk as he moved alone about the edges of the village ; soon they would be taunting him openly . It was one of these children who drove him to his decision . The little boy had been aping him behind his back , causing much merriment among onlookers , when Pentaquod suddenly turned and seized him , demanding to know why he was behaving so , and the child blurted out , My father says the council is meeting to punish you . ' And when Pentaquod looked about the village he realized that the elders were missing , and he knew that the boy was speaking truth . It took him only a few moments to reach that decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There would have to be long speeches , condemning him , but if this child 's father had actually used the word punish , a much more serious penalty than outlawing might be in store . His enemies had grown so outspoken that some might even demand death ; if they convinced themselves that he was indeed a spy for the northern tribes , this would be logical . So without returning to his wigwam , where his mother and father would be sitting in the sun , and without any attempt to recover his weapons , for this would excite those designated to watch him , he moved quietly away from the long building in which the council was meeting and toward the bank of the river . He did not , however , approach the canoes , for he knew that this would evoke alarm . Instead he kept his back to them as if watching the village , but from time to time he turned his  | head to follow the flight of some bird and in this manner was able to estimate the situation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant departure , but it was built of oak and was far too cumbersome for one man to handle . The plan he had in mind could succeed only if he could utilize a canoe light enough for him to portage , and one such stood close at hand ; it looked trim and handsome , but he had helped build it and knew its limitations : it had never won a race . Others were tempting , but he rejected them as either too slow or too heavy . There was , however , one small , swift canoe which he had helped build for one of the hunting chiefs ; it had been made of rare white pine from the north , and once during construction , when the fires burning away the insides grew too strong , he had lifted the canoe by himself and plunged it into the river , where the fires were quenched . The chief to whom it belonged had painted it yellow ; its sides were stout and it had been fitted with oaken struts . It had been well pointed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it was always armed for hunting and fishing , and so perched beside the river that one man , with a sturdy shove , could launch it . The yellow , ' he muttered to himself , and left the river area and returned to the heart of the village , walking casually toward the council hall , where he observed with satisfaction that the spies assigned to guard him were withdrawing so as to watch him more stealthily . This was essential to his plan , for he could not outfight them ; they were four and valiant , but he could outrun them , for he was swift . So when he had teased them into moving as far from the river as practical , he turned suddenly and leaped with deerlike speed back toward the river . When he reached the bank he did not rush immediately to the canoe of his choice ; instead he dashed along to the war canoe , taking all the paddles . Next he jumped to any lesser canoe showing paddles , and collected them too . Only then did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed through the village , he tossed the armful of paddles into the yellow canoe , gave its stern a mighty shove , then chased it into the muddy waters of the river , climbed aboard and started paddling vigorously downriver . In spite of the fact that his life depended upon the alacrity of his escape , he could not refrain from looking back at his village . There were the wigwams built low to the ground ; there was the home in which his parents would just now be hearing the news of his wild action ; and there was the long wigwam from which the high chiefs were already running to man the war canoe in which they must overtake the criminal . He could not take his eyes off the old men as they came to the river and saw that they were powerless to pursue him . His last view of his community showed a village in uproar , with stately chiefs running back and forth II  | waving their arms and , he suspected , shouting at their underlings . He burst into laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive he must exercise every skill he had mastered in his twenty-five years . He would have to pass two Susquehannock villages to the south , and since they were subservient to his , he had to suppose that they would intercept him and hold him for questioning . Furthermore , the men from his tribe would shortly find other paddles with which to activate their canoes , and pursuit would be inevitable . Indeed , he suspected that already runners had been sent overland to alert the southern allies , so that his chances of final escape were not great . But he was not without tactics of his own , and as soon as his stout strokes brought him near the first village , he chose a daring gambit . The runners ca n't have reached here yet , he reasoned , so I have one chance . He paddled boldly up to the shore , bellowing in a loud and agitated voice , Friends ! Have you seen a man and a woman go by in a canoe ? ' They came to the foreshore of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' My wife ! ' Pentaquod shouted , and the people began to laugh , because around the world there is nothing funnier than a wronged husband trying to recapture his runaway wife . Which way did they go ? ' he bawled . Into the cornfield ! ' they taunted , and for as long as he remained in sight , paddling desperately downriver , they stood on the shore , laughing at the grotesque figure he made , a husband paddling to overtake his wife and her lover . It was dusk when he approached the second village , on the eastern bank this time , and he doubted that he could work the same stratagem again , for the runners would have offered rewards for his capture . This time he slipped among the trees on the western shore and waited till deep night had fallen . He knew that on this day the half-moon would not illuminate the river till near midnight , but he also knew that after the moon did rise well in the heavens , no passage of the river would be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchmen had been placed , he allowed his canoe to drift down the western bank , ever so slowly , ever so silently , moving within the deep protection of the trees that lined the shore . When the canoe reached a position directly opposite the sleeping village , the spot at which detection would be most likely , he scarcely breathed , and to his relief his passage made no sound , alerted no watchman . At dawn he was paddling furiously down the middle of the river , taking advantage of whatever current was then moving . When the summer sun rose and he began to feel its oppressive heat , he wisely pulled into the mouth of a stream debouching from the west ,  | and there , under the protection of overhanging trees , he slept most of the day . At dusk he was back on the river , hungry and with tired muscles , but he paddled incessantly with those deep , rhythmic strokes which kept the canoe moving purposefully forward . It was toward morning of the third night , when he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he came to those falls which his people called Conowingo , and here he faced the test which would determine the success of his escape . When he approached the white and leaping water he intended to drag his canoe ashore and portage it a long distance downhill , but as he paddled away from the middle of the river to the safety of the shore , he spotted a course of unbroken , swiftly moving water which twisted and curved over rocks , and in the flash of a paddle he elected to trust his fortunes in the river rather than on the shore . He did so for a good reason : If I portage my canoe , the others may catch up . But if I go down this water , none will dare follow , and I shall be days ahead of them . As if conducting a ritual , he threw overboard all but two of the paddles he had been carrying , dropping them into the swift waters one by one , to track their passage through the falls . They follow the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the struts all hunting gear and one of his remaining paddles , against the chance that the one he was using might be swept away , and with the reassuring knowledge that he risked no more in going forward than he would in turning back , he drove his canoe into the turbulence . Hi-ya ! Hi-ya ! ' he shouted as he felt the waters take command , pulling the canoe forward with frightening speed . It was a stormy ride , with rocks visible on either side and white water piling into the log . His paddle , even when he used it with unaccustomed strength , accomplished little except to keep him preoccupied . At several points he felt sure that he must lose his canoe , and perhaps his life , too , but in the end the sturdy log bounced and chafed its way through the perilous rocks and the roaring water . When the passage was concluded he was exhausted , and that day slept soundly under the trees . Cool water came down a rivulet , and when he rose he drank copiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he gorged , and with the gear he had saved he caught two more small fish . Reassured in mind and replenished in sinew , he resumed his night paddling down the great river , and next morning decided not to sleep through the day , for ahead lay the vast body of water which he had heard of as a child and which was now his target . It lies to the south , ' the old seer of his village had said , the river of rivers in which the fish of fish abound . To paddle down it would take even the god of rivers many days , and its shores are cut with a hundred places to hide . On this river of rivers a storm lasts for nine days , and fish  | are so big , one can feed a village . But it is beautiful . It is so beautiful that if you are good and make your arrows straight and tend the yams , you may one day see it . I have never seen it , but it 's down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there it was , the Chesapeake ! In Pentaquod 's language the name meant : the great river in which fish with hard shell coverings abound , and each village along the Susquehanna possessed precious lengths of roanoke made from these white shells gathered from the Chesapeake . With enough roanoke a man could purchase even a chieftain 's daughter . The Chesapeake ! The name was familiar to all children , for on this great water strange things occurred . This was the magical place where the waters became even wider than those of the Susquehanna , where storms of enormous magnitude churned up waves of frightening power . This was the river of rivers , where the fish wore precious shells . Pentaquod leaned forward with his paddle across his knees , content to allow his yellow canoe to drift quietly into the bay , and with each length that the log moved forward , he saw some new revelation : the immensity of this water , the way the fish jumped as if they were eager to be caught and tasted , the constant movement of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and over all , the arching sky more blue than any he had seen before . For the whole day he drifted south in wonder , now close to one shore , now venturing out into the terrifying yet consoling middle . It was even bigger than the old seer had been able to convey ; it was more beautiful than a lifetime along an inland river would have intimated . From the moment he saw this magnificent body of water he lost all regret at having left his village on the river , for he had exchanged that collection of wattled wigwams for a greater majesty . He spent two days on the bay , enchanted each hour with some new brilliance : he loved the movement of the fish and the feeding of the birds , the way the sun rose enormous and red from the waters , or went to sleep in flashes of gold . Oh , what a universe ! ' he cried when his joy was greatest . To express this thought he used a Susquehannock word meaning : all that is seen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that this word had been invented so that a man like him could describe this new world which he had been allowed to enter . It had been his intention from the first moment he fled his village to find this legendary bay and take shelter in some likely haven on its western shore , for in his youth the shells his people had treasured had been brought to them by a stalwart tribe of people called the Potomacs , and he remembered that they lived along some river to the west . They were a warlike tribe , and in the years when they did not come in peace to trade , they came in war canoes to ravage . He would seek to join these  | Potomacs , reasoning that since he was much taller than most men and broader of shoulder , he would be welcomed . But now as he drifted down this peaceful body of water , so different from the constricted river he had known , so infinitely grander , he realized that he had no desire to join those warlike Potomacs , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was surfeited with fighting and with the old men who encouraged it . He wanted refuge in some tribe more placid than the ones he had known along the Susquehanna , more peaceful than the shell-trading Potomacs . So he refrained from paddling to the western shore . As a child he had been told that along the eastern shore of the bay lived other tribes of lesser breed who accomplished nothing in arms ; they were not even brave enough to venture north in trade . Occasionally bands of Susquehannocks had penetrated south to fight them , finding them ridiculously easy to subdue . It 's hardly fair to call them enemies , ' a warrior from beyond the bend had reported to Pentaquod 's village . They have few arrows and small canoes . Not many surplus shells for making roanoke , and no desirable women . Believe me , they are n't Potomacs . Those Potomacs know how to fight . ' Each disparagement of the eastern tribes that Pentaquod could now remember made them more attractive . If they were unlike the Susquehannocks , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better . And now , as if to exemplify this judgment , there appeared on the eastern shore the opening of a broad and congenial river , guarded by a low island burdened with magnificent trees . The river was spacious , inviting , peaceful and glowing with birds . And so , in the middle of the Chesapeake , Pentaquod , the Susquehannock who was tired of war , turned his log canoe not to the turbulent western shore , as he had intended , but to the quieter eastern shore , and that simple choice made all the difference .  | WHEN PENTAQUOD STEERED TOWARD THE EASTern river he was confronted by the tree-covered island he had seen from a distance , for it dominated the entrance . Poised between two headlands , one reaching down from the north , the other up from the south , it served as a welcoming sentinel and seemed to proclaim : All who enter this river find joy . The island was low-lying , but its stately trees rose so high and so unevenly that they created an impression of elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , towering pines and iridescent holly grew so thickly that the earth itself could scarcely be seen , and it was these trees which protected Pentaquod after he dragged his canoe ashore and collapsed from lack of food and sleep . When he awoke he became aware of one of earth 's most pleasing sensations : he was lying on a bed of pine needles , soft and aromatic , and when he looked upward he could not see the sky , for the pines grew so straight and tall that their branches formed a canopy which sunlight could not penetrate . The covering gave him confidence , and before he resumed his sleep he muttered , This is a good place , this place of trees . ' He was awakened by a sound he could not immediately identify . It was warlike and terrifying , coming at him from a spot directly overhead . It echoed ominously : Kraannk , kraannk , kraannk ! ' In fear he leaped to his feet , but as he stood there under the tall trees , preparing to defend himself , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the cry again , he remembered where he had heard it . Kraannk , kraannk ! ' It was Fishing-long-legs , one of the most ingratiating birds of the rivers and marshlands . There it stood , knee-deep in water : tall , thin , awkward , many hands  | high , with extremely long legs and rumpled white head . Its most prominent feature was a long yellowish bill , which it kept pointed downward at the water . Infrequently , when Pentaquod was young , this voracious fisherman had visited the Susquehanna to feed , wading tiptoe among the reeds , and often Pentaquod , while playing , had tried to imitate its movements . Now Pentaquod stood silent , watching the bird with affection as it stalked slowly , clumsily along the muddy shore , and out into the water until its bony knees were submerged . Then , with a dart of its long neck so swift that Pentaquod could not follow , it speared its sharp beak into the water and caught a fish . Raising its head , it tossed the fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gulp , it swallowed the fish , and Pentaquod could see the progress of the meal as it slowly passed down the extended gullet . For some time he stayed in the shadows , watching as the bird caught fish after fish . He must have made some sound , for the bird turned suddenly toward him , ran a few ungainly steps along the shore , then rose in slow , extended , lovely flight . Kraannk , kraannk ! ' it cried as it passed overhead . Knowing that there would be ample food , if he could but catch it , Pentaquod pulled his canoe farther inland , hiding it among the oaks and maples which lined the shore , for he knew that he must explore this island quickly . And as he moved among the trees and came to a meadow , he heard the comforting cry so familiar in his days along the great river : Bob-white ! Bob-white ! ' Now the call came from his left , then from a clump of grass to his right and sometimes from a spot almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinct as if an uncle who could whistle had been standing at his side . Bob-white ! ' It was the call of the quail , that sly bird with the brown-and-white head . Of all the birds that flew , this was the best eating , and if this island held a multitude , Pentaquod could not only survive on his fish but eat like a chieftain with his quail . With extreme caution he started inland , noticing everything , aware that his life might depend upon the carefulness of his observation . With every step he found only reassurance and never a sign of danger : nut trees laden with midsummer shells not yet ripe ; droppings of rabbits , and the signs that foxes lived here , and the location of brambled berry bushes , and the woody nests of eagles , and the honeysuckle twisting among the lower branches of the cedar trees . It was an island rich in signs and promises . On such an island a man with intelligence could live well , if he worked many hours each day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit himself to it , for he could not tell whether it was populated by other people , or what its temperament might be in a storm . He kept probing , and satisfied himself that it was more extensive west  | to east than it was north to south . A deep bay cutting in from the east almost met a stream in the south , nearly severing the island ; the eastern portion of this division was markedly richer than the western . He walked beneath majestic oaks until he reached the eastern tip , and there he stood , dumbfounded , for wherever he looked he saw a grand expanse of water forming itself into bays and creeks and coves and even small rivers for as far as he could see . And along the shores of these varied waters rose land of the most inviting nature : at times broad fields , at other times gently rising land covered with trees even taller than those on the island , and everywhere the impression of opulence , and quietness , and gentle living . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a storm this sleeping body of water might have the capacity for considerable turbulence , and he was certain that before he could possess any part of this wonderland he would have to contend with its present owners , who might be just as cantankerous as the Susquehannocks , but of one thing he was certain : along this splendid river he wished to spend the rest of his life . He had no sooner come to this decision than a snorting kind of sound attracted his attention , and he turned to look behind him , among the trees , and there stood a huge-eyed doe with two brown-speckled fawns . The three deer halted in rigid attention , staring at this stranger . Then the inquisitive doe cocked her head , and this almost undetectable action released the fawns , and they began to move cautiously toward Pentaquod , little deer on unsteady legs exploring their new world . When they had moved quite close to Pentaquod their suspicious mother gave a cough , and the babies leaped sideways , ran in distracted circles , then stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward Pentaquod , lifting their spindly legs in delightful awkwardness , probing with their great eyes . Heh ! ' Pentaquod whispered . The fawns stared at him , and one moved closer . ' Heh ! ' The foremost fawn cocked its little head , waited , then resumed its approach . When it had come so close that Pentaquod could have reached out and touched it , the doe gave a warning snort , leaped aside , raised her white tail and darted back into the woods . The trailing fawn did likewise , but the one closest to Pentaquod became confused , or stubborn , and did not follow the others to safety . It simply stood there , staring at this stranger , and after a moment the mother returned in a series of fine leaps , swept past the inquisitive fawn and lured it into the trees . Fish and quail and deer ! Pentaquod thought . And if one finds seed , maize and probably pumpkins . Turkeys too , if I guess right . And not many people , judging so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his canoe , caught some fish for supper , made a small fire and with a large handful of blackberries to accent the smoking fish , fed well . He slept well , too , except that long before dawn he heard in the sky overhead the cry he would always associate with his first exploration of this river : Kraannk , kraannk ! ' It was Fishing-long-legs coming back to patrol the shore . In the days that followed , Pentaquod explored every corner of the island and concluded that whereas others might know of it , they certainly did not think enough of it to build their homes here , for he could find no sign of habitation . And so far as he could ascertain , not even the meadows that appeared at curious intervals among the trees had ever grown corn or squash , and on none of the headlands facing the island could he detect any indication of either homes or cultivated fields . This did not disturb him . If land as congenial as this existed upriver , there would be no reason for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer inland . Storms coming off the bay would be diminished and distances across water shortened . Perhaps the land would be richer , too , and there might be other advantages which he could not envisage . But on one point he was satisfied : life here would be good . For the time being he quit his speculations , accepting the boon he had been granted . He built himself a small , well-hidden wigwam inland from the northern shore , using bent saplings for the frame and abundant river grasses for the roof . He found it so easy to catch fish that he did not even have to go after them in his canoe : the large brown-speckled ones with the blunt snouts swam up to him determined to be caught , and whereas he had been unable yet to trap any of the numerous bob-whites , he had shot one deer , which would feed him for some time . A fox strolled by one afternoon , and one night a skunk made things odorous . He rather liked the smell of skunk , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods which he had trailed as a boy , of cold autumn nights , and the snugness of winter . It was the smell of nature , heavy and pervasive : it assured him that life in all its complexity was thriving . He had rarely seen a skunk , and he saw none now , but he was pleased that they shared the island with him . It was his friend Fishing-long-legs who introduced him to one of the strangest experiences of the eastern shore . The blue-feathered bird with the long beak had flown in one evening with its accustomed croaking cry and was now probing the shallow waters along the shore , ignoring the man to whom it had become accustomed . Suddenly it shot its fierce bill deep into the water and came up with a struggling something Pentaquod had not seen before . It was larger than a man 's hand , seemed to have numerous legs that squirmed in the fading sunlight and was brown-green in color . The bird was obviously pleased with its catch , for it threw it in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gulped down one half , allowing the other to fall into the water . The swallowed portion was so big and with so many protruding legs that it required time and effort to maneuver it down the long gullet , but once this was accomplished , the bird retrieved and ate the other half . Having enjoyed a feast of this kind , it did not bother with mere fish . With a short run it rose in the air , uttered its mournful croaking and soared away . Pentaquod went to where the fish had feasted , searching for clues . There were none . The bird had eaten everything . Next day he went there with his fishing line , but caught nothing . However , some days later he watched as Fishing-long-legs caught another of these morsels , enjoying it even more than before , and Pentaquod crept close to see if he could determine what it was that the bird was eating . He discovered nothing he had not seen before : bigger than a man 's hand , many legs , browngreen in color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was determined to solve this mystery , and the first clue came one day while he walked along the southern shore of his island : washed up on the beach and obviously dead lay a creature much like the one the bird had been catching . It was the right size ; it had many feet , or what passed for feet ; and it was brown-green , with touches of blue underneath . But there the similarity stopped , for this dead animal was encased in a shell so hard that no bird could eat it . Also , its two front legs had formidable jaws with serrated , heavy teeth which could , if the animal were alive , inflict substantial harm . How could the bird cut this shell in half ? Pentaquod asked himself , and then , an even more perplexing question : And how could he swallow it if he did ? He tapped the hard substance and knew there was no possible way for that bird to swallow that shell . For ten days he tried to catch one of these strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that period he saw Fishing-long-legs catch one , cut it in half and force the food down its long neck . In frustration , he realized that this was a mystery he was not destined to solve . He did , however , discover two facts about his home that disturbed him . The more he explored the two deep cuts which came close to bisecting the island , the more he realized that some day the two arms must meet , cutting the island in half , and if this could be done , why might there not evolve other cuts to fragment it further ? His second discovery came as the consequence of a sudden and devastating storm . The midpoint of summer had passed and life on the island had been a growing joy ; this was really an almost ideal place to live , and he supposed that later on , when he had traveled upriver to establish contact with whatever tribes occupied the area , he would become a member of their unit . But for the time being he was content with his solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heavy moist air , and in the late afternoon a bank of towering clouds gathered in the southwest , on the opposite side of the bay . With a swiftness that he had never witnessed in the north this congregation of blackness started rushing eastward , and even though the sun remained shining over Pentaquod 's head , it was obvious that a storm of some magnitude must soon break . Still the sun shone ; still the sky remained clear . Deer moved deeper into the forest and shore birds retreated to their nests , although the only sign of danger was that galloping cloud bank approaching the bay . Pentaquod watched its arrival . It struck the distant western shore with enormous fury , turning what had been placid water into turbulent , crested waves leaping and tossing white spume into the air . The clouds moved so swiftly that they required only moments to cross the bay , their progress marked by the wildly leaping waves . With the storm came an immense amount of rain , falling in sheets slanting eastward . For it to speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment of time , and then the storm was striking Pentaquod , descending on him in a fury he had not witnessed before . Great jagged flashes of lightning tore through the sky , followed almost instantly by shattering claps of thunder ; there was no echo , for the world was drowned in rain . Winds of extraordinary power ripped along the surface of the bay , lashing it into waves of pounding force . But Pentaquod was not afraid of the storm , and next morning , when it had passed and he surveyed his island , he did not find the damage excessive . He had seen storms before , rather violent ones which swept down the river valley of his home , and although this one had been swifter and more thunderous , it was merely an exaggeration of what he had long known . The trees knocked down were larger than any he had seen go down in the north , and that was about it . If storms on the island were no worse than this , he could abide them . What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder about his new home ? After his cursory inspection of the island , and after satisfying himself that his yellow canoe had survived , he behaved like any prudent husbandman and started checking the general situation , desiring to see if any animals had been killed or streams diverted , and as he came to a spot on the northwestern tip of the island , he noticed that the storm , and more particularly the pounding waves , had carried away a substantial portion of the shore . Tall pines and oaks which had marked this point had been undercut and now lay sprawled in the water side by side , like the bodies of dead warriors after battle . Wherever he went along the western shore he saw this same loss of land . The tragedy of the storm was not that it had knocked down a few trees , for more would grow , and not that it had killed a few fish , for  | others would breed , but that it had eaten away a substantial edge of the island , and this was a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would abandon this island , congenial though it was , and look farther inland . Accordingly , he crossed the now-calm river , paddling until he reached the base of a tall cliff which had attracted him from that first day on which he had surveyed the river . It lay due east of the island , and formed a headland with deep water west and north . It guarded the entrance to a fine small creek , but it was the sheer southern exposure which gave the cliff its dignity ; taller than five men and topped with oaks and locusts , its sandy composition was so light that it shone for great distances , forming a beacon at the edge of the river . Pentaquod , seeing the crumbling nature of its face , suspected that it , too , might be falling from the action of waves , but when he brought his canoe to its base he was gratified to see that it had not been touched by the recent storm ; he judged that it was never menaced because its placement kept it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land at the base of the cliff : where would one beach a canoe or hide it ? How would one climb to the plateau above ? At the eastern end of the cliff 's river face there was low land , and it was most inviting , but it was exposed , and Pentaquod avoided it . Paddling into the small creek , he inspected the forbidding slope of the northern face and rejected it , too , but some distance up the creek he found low land , safe and well-wooded , with a score of likely anchorages . Choosing one , he pulled his canoe far inland , hiding it beneath a cluster of maples , and began the stiff climb to the top of the headland . What a memorable place he discovered : a small plot of flat , open land near the edge of the cliff surrounded by tall and stately oaks and pines . In every direction save east he could see extensively , and his eyes leaped from one spectacular view to another : to the north a bewildering maze of headlands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south a new definition of vast loneliness , for there lay the marshes , refuges for innumerable birds and fish and small animals ; the noble view lay to the west where the island glowed in sunlight , with the blue waters of the bay beyond . From this headland Pentaquod could see across the bay to the mysterious lands where the Potomacs ruled , but if he looked downward instead of out , he saw on all sides his river , peaceful and reassuring . On this headland , speculating as to what prudent steps he must take next , Pentaquod spent some of the quietest weeks of his life . The loneliness of the first days of his flight had now vanished , and he was at ease with his decision to quit the Susquehannocks . The spaciousness of his surroundings infected him , and he began to think in slower , less frantic terms . The natural fear that he might be unable to survive in a strange  | world dissolved , and he discovered in himself a courage much more profound than that required to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of sustaining him in a confrontation with an entire world . Sometimes he would sit beneath the oak tree under whose protection he had built his small wigwam and simply survey his universe : the fascinating arms of water to the north , the vast marshes to the south , the western shore of the bay where the warlike tribes paraded , and he would think : This is the favored land . This is the richness . One morning as he worked on his canoe down by the creek he heard a sound which caused him to catch his breath with joy : Kraannk , kraannk ! ' It was one of the ugliest sounds in nature , as awkward and ungainly as the creature that uttered it , but to Pentaquod it meant the return of a friend , and he rushed to the water 's edge to welcome Fishinglong-legs as that inelegant bird landed in a crash and a clutter , throwing mud and water as it dug its feet in to stop . Bird ! Bird ! ' he called joyously as the fisher landed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional steps and took off again , flapping its huge blue wings and soaring slowly , spaciously into the sky . Come back ! ' Pentaquod pleaded , but it was gone . He stayed by the small stream all that day , irritated with himself for having frightened the bird , and toward dusk he was rewarded with another utterance of that sweet , raucous cry . Kraannk , kraannk ! ' the long-legged creature shouted as it wheeled in for a new try at the fishing grounds . This time Pentaquod did not speak ; in fact , he remained quite motionless so that the feeding bird would not be aware of him , and after a while it came probing close to where he stood . Suddenly the bird looked up , saw him and at the same time saw in the waters below the choicest morsel in the bay . With a swift dart of its beak the small head dived , caught its prey and raised its head exultantly , throwing the catch in the air , then snapping it in two . What is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched one of the many-footed halves disappear down its gullet . Ignoring the man , the bird reached into the waters to retrieve the second half , and this , too , it sent down its very long neck . Pentaquod could watch the progress of the mysterious meal , eaten with such relish , and determined to catch a fish for himself . Unfortunately , he had no concept of what he was trying to catch and so did not succeed . He did , however , find scores of trees with ripening nuts and new kinds of berries and different succulent fish in the river and haunts of deer that seemed so plentiful that no man need ever go hungry . But now , as autumn approached with an occasional cold day warning of winter , he began to ponder seriously the matter of establishing contact with whatever tribes inhabited this area . All he knew of them were the legends of his youth : Below us at the end of our river is a larger river ,  | much larger . On the west are the Potomacs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one of consequence . If they live on rivers like this , Pentaquod thought , they are of consequence . Then he reflected on what this meant ; they were certainly not of any importance to the Susquehannocks , for they had neither trade goods to be envied nor war canoes to fear . No doubt the Potomacs , who had both , had the same low opinion of the easterners . But what did the easterners think of themselves ? What did Pentaquod , living gently as an easterner , think of himself ? It is so much easier here . He was now convinced that somewhere along this bountiful river tribes were living , and it seemed obligatory that he find them before winter , so with some reluctance he decided to abandon this highly satisfactory home on the cliff and move closer to where his future partners must be hiding . Accordingly , he mended rough spots on his canoe , dragged it into the creek , climbed in and started paddling eastward until he came to a huge , sprawling marsh whose tall grasses rose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his paddle hundreds of birds arose , and he judged that fish must be plentiful , too . As he moved along the marsh he found it a warm , soggy , gently swaying place , stretching endlessly and writhing with new forms of life . When he had traversed a long segment he found to his satisfaction that a small , well-concealed creek led into the middle of the rushes : An excellent place for protection . And when he had penetrated the wandering cove , invisible from the main body of the river , he found its northern shore composed of fast land well-wooded and of good quality . A wigwam here would be protected by the marsh , he reasoned , and when it was constructed he felt a sense of security which he had not known before : Even if I find no others , I can live here . But on the third night , when he was congratulating himself as the fire burned low , he heard a buzzing , and knew , from his childhood days , that mosquitoes had moved in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came in phalanxes and attacked with the vigor of hunting dogs . One alone could do more damage than twenty along the Susquehanna , and they drove him nearly mad with their incessant onslaughts . In fact , they stung him so furiously that he had to plunge into the creek to drown them , but when he emerged their brothers were waiting . In the aching dawn , when he surveyed his lumpy arms and felt the sting-spots on his face , he wondered if he could remain in such a place , but on subsequent nights he discovered that if he kept a smudge-fire going , and closed down all the openings of his wigwam , and smeared his face with rancid fish grease , and hid every inch of his body beneath cloth or grass , he could survive . It was n't pleasant , and he sweated like an  | animal , but he did survive , and it occurred to him that when the Great Power , Manitou , finished laying down this river , perfect in all details , He had added the mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always mosquitoes . And bigger ones than these could not exist . During the day he fished and hunted , noting where the beaver were and the bear ; also , he tentatively probed inland , seeking any signs of human occupation , but he found none . Fishing-long-legs came to visit almost daily , and little green herons and brilliant cardinals and kingfishers from their muddy nests , and hundreds of quail making the autumn afternoons ring with their whistling cries . This was a much more compact world than either the island or the cliff ; its horizon was limited to the distance a stone could be tossed , but it was snug and secure , and one afternoon Pentaquod decided : If I must live alone , this wo n't be so bad . . . especially when cold drives away the mosquitoes . And then one morning , while he was still abed on his paillasse of pine needles , he heard a wild cacophony , a rumble which seemed to move the earth yet came from the sky , and he rushed out to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of them crying in loud voices , ' On k-or , onk-or ! ' And in that first moment of seeing the geese he comprehended them totally : jet-black head and neck , snow-white underchin , beautiful cream body with brown top , black tail , raucous , lovable , fat and constantly shouting to each other , ' On k-or ! ' He had hoped that these powerful birds would land on his waters , but they flew past , arguing loudly , and then more came , and more , and more ; they were so numerous he had no system of numbers to count them . But finally one especially noisy group of about seventy wheeled in the air , flew low over his head and landed with riotous splashing in his marsh or with grinding feet upon his land . Close at hand they seemed too big to be called birds ; they were more like flying bear cubs loaded with edible meat . The arrival of this bountiful food was so mysterious that he became afraid . As a boy he had watched when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days before flying on , and he assumed that these huge creatures would do the same . Each morning he expected them to leave , and each night they remained , foraging in the fields and marshes along the river , always crying , Onk-or ! ' Every eight or nine days he trapped one and gorged himself on the tasty meat , afraid that this might be his last feast , but always the great birds stayed . They were with him through the autumn ; on some days when they flew off at dawn to feed on new fields , their wings would darken the sky , their honking cries would deafen . Once at the edge of the marsh Pentaquod tried to estimate how thick the cloud was as the birds flew overhead , and he supposed that at each spot as many as three hundred were flying  --  one above the other until the sun could not be seen .  | And in the afternoon when the birds returned they would congregate on the north bank of the river , so that the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the muddy banks would be black with birds from the shoreline to where the trees started . Again Pentaquod tried to count how many rows of birds lined the shore at a given spot : starting at the water 's edge there would be more than fifty , one after the other , reaching back to the first trees . It was a richness he could not comprehend . These great noisy birds were infinite . At first he thought that he should kill several , smoke their meat and feed off them through the winter . But what if the birds stayed on , standing there on the shore in endless rows , waiting to be taken ? There would be no need to conserve . One would simply catch them , one after another , as need commanded . And the birds did stay , as rich a food resource as the great bay provided , for along with the larger birds came a bewildering variety of smaller ducks of the kind that Pentaquod had seen once or twice in sparing numbers along his native river . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when caught and cooked . Once , when many big and little birds settled along the edges of his marsh , Pentaquod sat with his hands over his face in prayer . The birds , preparing for sleep , were making a violent chatter , and he listened to the noise as if it had been sweet music : Great Power , thank You for sending them to feed us through the winter .. . And as soon as he had uttered the word us he realized how lonely he was , how bereft . And next morning he determined to quit this haven among the marshes and find the people who had to be living somewhere along this fortunate river . He had paddled only a short distance to the east when he spied a small bay opening into the northern shore . It looked as if it might hide a village , though how one could have existed so close at hand without his noticing was confusing ; when he probed into the bay he saw that it opened into several smaller arms , and at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnants of a village . Pilings had been driven into the shore and to them canoes had once been attached ; there were also platforms on which oval wigwams of some size had once stood . The foreshore had been cleared as well as two fields in back , and as he explored the area gingerly , without getting out of his canoe , he found that all along the edges of the bay were other signs of occupation . Returning to the larger site , he beached his canoe , tied it to one of the pilings and walked ashore . He stayed for many days , gratified to see that the large noisy geese came to the bay at night , and in this time he was able to explore enough of the countryside east of the abandoned town to know that he had come  | at last upon the occupied portion of the river . Where the people were now he could not say , but all signs indicated that they must have been there recently and moved away of their own volition . There was no indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been no cause for starvation . Indeed , as he stood on the remnants of the village , he could not know that even though he had already discovered the deer and the abundant fish and now the large birds , he had failed to find the two sources of food supply for which this region would be famous . The apparent abandonment was the more perplexing in that when Pentaquod inspected the site closely he became convinced of its suitability . It had fresh water , protection , a convenient relationship with the river , many tall trees and a hinterland suitable for either hunting or the cultivation of corn . There was , however , one ominous feature he could not explain , and in the end he reasoned that this might represent the sinister force which had caused the evacuation . But what was it ? A pile , large at the base and almost as high as a man 's head , of a kind of shell he had not seen before : somewhat smaller than a hand and much thinner , composed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside . It had no smell , a solidity that mystified him , and one sharp edge . This led him to believe that perhaps the pile had been assembled for use in war ; the individual shells might be thrown at the enemy , but when he tried hurling them at a tree , the edges were so sharp he cut his forefinger and concluded that the pile was merely one more mystery of the new river . And then one afternoon as he sat idly in the deserted village he heard a subdued but persistent noise coming from the east , and at first he thought it must be some animal , but it was so varied and purposeful that he knew it had to be associated with people : A war party victorious and inattentive . But then the noise grew much louder , with sounds that could be made only by children , and incredulously he muttered , It ca n't be a whole village . . . making such noise as it approaches a dangerous spot . ' A band of Susquehannocks moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most attentive enemy scouts would not hear . Noisy behavior like this was unbelievable . He was so bewildered that he moved out to intercept the strangers , darting carefully from one tree to the next as he had been taught . When he was safely located so that he could watch both the forest and the river , he waited while the approaching noises increased . And then he saw a sight which was even stranger than the sound . Down the trail , ignoring possible danger , came the happy , carefree population of the empty village . Women straggled along ; children shouted raucously ; and all were led by a white-haired old man wearing upon his chest a disk of polished copper signifying that he was the werowance.  | Never before had Pentaquod seen a tribe so poorly led , so pathetically disciplined . Nor had he ever seen people so small . They 're all children ! ' he whispered . They ca n't be grown people ! ' But they were , and this discovery determined what he would do , but even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : when the frolicking tribe was almost upon him he leaped boldly onto the path , holding up his right hand . The old werowance stopped as commanded ; those behind kept coming on ; some children screamed ; and the warriors knew not what to do . In the confusion Pentaquod cried in a loud voice , I am Pentaquod , the Susquehannock ! ' The werowance did not hear well , and the little that did come through he did not comprehend . Turning to those behind , he asked what the frightening stranger had said , but they had not understood either . Where 's Scar-chin ? ' the trembling werowance pleaded , and when that emaciated warrior was located , his chin cleft years before by the tomahawk of a Susquehannock , he was pushed forward to ask in the tongue Pentaquod had used , Are you a Susquehannock ? ' Pentaquod nodded , and the interpreter reported this intelligence to the werowance , who said , Ask if he means war . ' Do you come seeking war ? ' No . ' An audible sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the werowance frowned and said , Tell him we have nothing to trade , ' and when this was interpreted , Pentaquod said , I , too , have nothing . ' Again there came the sigh of relief , after which the werowance asked in some perplexity , Then why is he here ? ' and when this was spoken in Susquehannock , Pentaquod replied simply , I am a fugitive . I come seeking refuge . ' When this startling information was circulated , the little people uttered whispers of compassion and said that perhaps he might wish to stay with them , for they needed men , and he was greater than any they had known . They jabbered that once or twice in each generation gangs of Susquehannocks , tall like him , had strayed onto this river , always to plunder or take slaves . Scar-chin had been captured on such a raid and had lived among the warlike northerners for seven years , an adventure of which he never ceased talking , and now he was assigned to walk with the newcomer as the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's ours , ' he said . We call it Patamoke . I 'm sure the name has a meaning , but I forget what it is . Yes , we leave it every summer to live in the woods close to the great water . ' The great water is over there , ' Pentaquod corrected , pointing toward the bay . There is a greater over there , ' Scar-chin explained , pointing east . Such information Pentaquod did not believe , but he thought it best not to argue with this excitable little man . I ,  | Pentaquod led them to the rude wigwam he had constructed , and the children in the party ran to it , using it as part of a game , laughing at the inept way the sides fitted against the roof . Some of the women gathered about the sleeping place , too , ridiculing its unfamiliar patterns , unaware of rudeness in such behavior , and when Pentaquod moved to protect his few belongings from the children , the women sided with him and called to the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they smiled up at the tall man , their eyes sparkling . The returning villagers had lingered only briefly , for the werowance now spoke to them in soft tones , whereupon the character of the motley crowd changed abruptly and they scurried back to their home . The warriors went into the woods and began cutting trees , while the women and children attended to the smoothing out of the stone platforms on which the winter 's lodgings would be built . When these things were done , the entire tribe moved to the shore and began picking the grasses from which the sides of the wigwams would be woven . Pentaquod was impressed with the orderly way in which the tribe worked ; they appeared to be much better builders than the Susquehannocks . When the preliminary tasks were finished , and the materials laid in strategic spots so that building could progress on the morrow , they rested , and Pentaquod had a chance to talk in more detail with Scar-chin , who told him of his long captivity among the Susquehannocks , and of how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susquehannock women had made fun of him for being so small and skinny . What is your tribe called ? ' Pentaquod asked . We are one small part of the Nanticokes . The great werowances live to the south . We have only a lesser werowance , as you 've seen . ' Have you a name ? ' Scar-chin shrugged his shoulders , as if the mystery of names was reserved for shamans or those who cast medicine . He did , however , venture the information that frequently the powerful Nanticokes to the south invaded the village to steal whatever the local people had acquired . Are they so much braver ? ' No , more of them . ' Do you fight back ? In battle ? ' Scar-chin laughed . We 're not Susquehannocks . When the Nanticokes come , we run into the woods . We leave enough behind so they wo n't want to pursue us , and when they 've taken what they want , they leave , and then we come back . ' Such behavior was so extraordinary that Pentaquod could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers together , and as he did so he spied the pile of white shells . Do n't you use them against the Nan-ticokes ? ' Use what ? '  | Those . . . well , those shells ? ' Those ! ' Scar-chin stared at the shells , then broke into laughter . He summoned a group of tribesmen and shared the hilarious joke with them ? He thinks we throw them at the Nanticokes ! ' And all his listeners began to laugh , and some of the children started skimming the white shells into the river . Pentaquod , taking no offense asked , What are they ? ' You do n't know ? ' Scar-chin asked in amazement . From one of the teasing children he took a shell , held it at chest level and imitated a man eating from it , whereupon one of the women ran to the shore , dived into the cold water , and within a few moments reappeared , holding in her hand a dripping object constructed of two of the shells bound together . Running to Pentaquod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hands , presenting him with the river-born object . He took it , was impressed by its roughness and heaviness . What is it ? ' he asked Scar-chin . He does n't know what it is ! ' the interpreter shouted , pleased with his new-found importance as the only one in the town who could speak with this Susquehannock . He does n't know what it is ! ' the children echoed gleefully , and everyone watched as the tall man from the north wrestled with the connected shells . Finally the young woman who had brought him the present took it back , reached for a sharp-pointed stick and deftly split open the shell . One half she threw away . The other she handed gravely to Pentaquod , indicating that he should eat . Trained on venison and rabbit and fish , he looked at the strange object in his hand . In no way could he relate it to food such as he had known : it was watery , and slippery , and had no bones , and there was no sensible way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laden shell from his nervous hand , she lifted it to his lips , told him to open his mouth , and with a delicate twist of her fingers popped the food in . For an instant he was aware of a fine , salty taste and a pleasing sensation . Then the food , whatever it was , disappeared , leaving on his face a most bewildered look . With an easy throwing motion , the girl tossed the empty shell onto the mound . We call them kawshek , ' Scar-chin explained . More sleeping in the river than you could count . All winter we feed on kawshek . ' Pentaquod contemplated this : in addition to the abundance of food he had discovered by himself , there was this additional supply hidden in the river . It was inconceivable , and as he sat perplexed , trying to unravel the mystery of oysters , he thought of his friend Fishing-long-legs , and he queried Scar-chin . What is it he catches on the bottom , cuts in two and swallows with such difficulty ? '  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . Shaped like a hand , with many legs . ' As soon as Pentaquod uttered these words a benign smile spread over the scarred face of his interpreter , who said nothing . Obviously he was recalling moments of past happiness , after which he summoned the girl who had caught the oysters . He does n't know crabs , either , ' he whispered . The girl smiled and with her right hand gave an imitation of a crab wriggling its many feet . Then a look of compassion filled her eyes ; to be ignorant of the oyster was amusing , but to be unacquainted with the crab was pathetic . What is crab ? ' Pentaquod asked , and Scar-chin replied , When Manitou , the Great Power , finished populating the river with everything our village required  --  pine trees for canoes , deer to feed us in summer , geese and oysters for winter  --  He saw that we were grateful and well disposed . So in His grace He created one thing more , to stand as a token of His eternal concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salty waters . ' Women in the crowd asked what he had said so far , then prompted him to add details that interested them : A crab provides little food , so he is not easy to eat . But the little he does offer is the best food under the sky . To eat crab you must work , which makes you appreciate him more . He is the blessing , the remembrance . And no man or woman ever ate enough . ' Pentaquod listened with growing respect as Scar-chin reported on this delicacy , and when the oration ended he asked tentatively , Could I taste some ? ' They come only in summer . ' Did n't you dry any ? ' This question , when interpreted , brought laughter , which ended when the girl moved forward to indicate that the meat of the crab was so delicate it had to be eaten immediately ; her fine fingers danced as she portrayed this . Again Pentaquod fell to rumination , confused by this barrage of strange information . But if the crab has the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated as the girl nodded , then knocked her knuckles together to prove how hard the shell was . Aha ! ' Pentaquod demanded , grabbing her by the wrist . If the shell is so hard , how is it that Fishing-long-legs can cut it in half with his beak ? ' When Scar-chin explained that the Susquehannock used that name for the great blue heron , and that he was referring to the manner in which the heron caught crabs , tossed them in the air and cut them in half , the girl 's expression became even more compassionate . It 's the soft crab , ' she explained . The what ? '  | In the summer we catch crabs that have no shell .. This was totally incomprehensible , and Pentaquod shook his head , but the girl continued , They have no shell , and we roast them over the fire , and they are the best . ' Pentaquod could make absolutely nothing of this , and he was about to drop the whole discussion when a boy of about nine summers moved beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-to-mouth indicated that he himself could eat four or five of the no-shell crabs . This seemed preposterous and Pentaquod turned away , but the daring boy tugged on his arm and repeated the pantomime : he could indeed eat five no-shells . When the crowd dispersed to arrange ramshackle sleeping quarters for the night , Pentaquod retreated from the shore to his own wigwam , but before he fell asleep he found Scar-chin standing in the rude doorway . Stay with us , ' the little man said . Pentaquod made no reply . The werowance is old now , and sad . ' No comment . The girl who caught the oyster for you , she is his granddaughter , and whenever he sees her it causes pain . ' This was impenetrable , but the little man continued , Her father , the werowance 's son who should be in command now , died of the fever and the girl reminds him of this loss . ' Pentaquod saw no reason to respond to any of this , so in the darkness the little interpreter remained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall Susquehannock who had made this day so memorable . At last , when night surrounded the village , the former slave of the Susquehannocks slipped away . In the ensuing weeks the villagers rebuilt their wigwams and instructed Pentaquod in their language , a much simpler one than his . In all ways this tribe lived on a less complicated level than the Susquehannocks : their werowance had little power and their possessions were fewer . Their medicine man was not so formidable as the mysterious shamans of the north , and for him to try to enforce decisions of life and death would have been laughable ; he was a good-luck charm and nothing more . The little old werowance was named Orapak ; he was past sixty and must soon die , but was allowed to retain his office because there was none to challenge him . He was a wise old man , and gentle too , and for many years he had kept his tribe out of serious trouble . When the Nanticokes come north to fight us , we flee farther north , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we flee to the south . ' Does n't that take you into Nanticoke country ? ' No , because when we flee south , we go into the marshes , and the Nanticokes would n't dare follow us . ' He hesitated . Mosquitoes , you know . ' I know . Last summer I lived in the marsh . '  | Brave man , ' the werowance said . Then he asked , Why did you think we leave our village each summer ? ' What good do mosquitoes do ? ' Pentaquod asked , whereupon the old man raised his eyes to heaven and replied , On that first day Scar-chin here told you of how Manitou gave this river everything , and then one thing more , the crab . Well , when that was done He said , " Now I will keep men from becoming arrogant , " and He threw in the mosquito . ' ' Why ? ' To remind us that He can do anything He pleases , and we have to like it . ' Pentaquod decided that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tribe . The river is excellent . I enjoyed it when I lived here alone . ' The werowance studied this declaration , then blew out his cheeks , signifying that he appreciated the gravity of what had been said . The Susquehannock was pointing out that he had acquired possession of the place after the villagers had deserted it . He was intimating ownership , even though many warriors were available to contest it . Orapak realized how powerful this stranger was ; quite likely he could defeat any of the warriors who up to now had defeated nobody . Warily he said , It would be good if you stayed with us , ' adding hastily , in the wigwam that 's already yours . ' I would like that , ' Pentaquod replied , and no more was said about his citizenship . He continued to occupy his wigwam , which women showed him how to finish properly , and he began paying court to Navitan , the werowance 's granddaughter . At seventeen she had been eyeing some of the young warriors during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed herself receptive to the moves the tall Susquehannock was making . They were married before the first snow . The old women were delighted that their Navitan had caught herself such a daring man , and the shaman who performed the ceremony gave it as his opinion that Manitou Himself had sent Pentaquod to protect this village . In the division of labor common to tribes along the Chesapeake , Pentaquod specialized in cutting tall trees , shaping them and burning out their interior so that canoes could be built . He also became the expert in hunting geese , those remarkable fowl that he had known simply as big birds : from oak and pine he carved eighteen rude likenesses of the geese , coloring them with earthen paints discovered by the tribe , and these he placed at strategic spots related to wind and shore , luring the birds so close that he rarely missed with his strong bow . But the killing of a goose always bothered him ; for although he loved the taste of the roasted flesh , he did not like to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter when the sad night came . Navitan had been  | scraping the reef for oysters when she saw a flock of geese in a cornfield acting strangely . The males were running at one another , and the yearlings were restless , gathering twigs as if to build nests they knew they did not need . Uneasy chatter murmured through the flock , when suddenly an old gander , much heavier than the rest , ran awkwardly a few steps , flapped his great wings and soared into the air . In an instant that whole field of geese flew aloft , circled a few times , then set out resolutely for the north . From other fields which Navitan could not see , other flocks rose into the air , and soon the sky was dark with great black-and-gray geese flying north . Oh ! ' she cried , alerting the village . They 're leaving ! ' No one required to be told who was leaving . The geese , those notable birds on whom the tribe had feasted for generation after generation , were quitting the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible anywhere , and to see them flying north , to hear them honking as they repaired to the distant ice-bound fields on which they would raise their young , was a moment of such sadness that many of the older men and women wept , for the great geese had been their calendars and the counting of their years . Now the werowance appeared , white and stiff-legged , with his face to the sky , and after he had cast his blessing on the geese , the shaman uttered the timeless prayer : Great Power , You who watch over us and establish the seasons , guard the geese as they leave us . Watch over them as they fly to distant areas . Find them grain for their long flight and keep them from storms . They are our need , our protection from hunger , our sentinels at night , our companions through the winter , our source of food and warmth , our tenants on the land , our watchmen in the sky , the guardians of our streams , the chatterers at the coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from us , and in due season bring them back to this river , which is their home and ours . ' No child made a sound , for this was the most sacred moment of the year . If the mysteries were not properly cast , the geese might fail to return , and the winter when that occurred would be terrible indeed . Some moons after the geese had gone , crabs moved in to take their place as the principal source of food , and now Pentaquod discovered what the villagers meant when they claimed that Manitou , the Great Power , looked after them especially . It was a day in late spring when Navitan led him to her canoe , handing him a basketful of fish heads and bear  | gristle to tote along . The concoction smelled offensive , but Navitan assured him this was what the crabs preferred , and he wondered how the loose and almost rotting stuff could be attached to the curved hooks used in fishing . To his surprise , his wife had no hooks . What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled without offering an explanation . But once he had paddled her to the spot she had selected , she produced long strands of twisted fiber and deer gut , and to these she tied fish heads and chunks of gristly bear meat , throwing the lines aft . Pentaquod looked for the telltale signs which indicated that a fish had bitten the lure , but there was no such movement and he concluded that Navitan was not going to catch any crabs , but after a while , when there was no visible reason for her doing so , she began to pull in one of her lines with her left hand , holding in her right a long pole to which was attached a loosely woven wicker basket . As the line slowly left the water , Pentaquod saw that the first fish head was about to appear , but what he did not see was that attached to it was a crab , cutting at the meat with his powerful claws and oblivious of the fact that it was being pulled almost out of the water . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her basket into the water and under the startled crab , lifting it as it tried to fall away , and plopping it , all legs wiggling and claws snapping , into the canoe . Pentaquod was stunned by the performance , and when his wife continued to haul in her line , catching crab after crab , he realized that here was a brand of fishing totally unlike any in which he had ever participated . Why do n't they swim away from the bait ? ' he asked . Ca n't they . , ee you 're going to catch them ? ' They like us to eat them , ' Navitan said . Manitou sends them to us for that purpose . ' Pentaquod gingerly touched one and found the shell extremely hard , but he could not examine it closely , for the fierce claws snapped at him . He was even more perplexed when Navitan carried her two dozen crabs to camp and pitched them into a pot of boiling water , for within moments they turned bright red . She then instructed him in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a clay bowl filled she told him to stop , for she knew that picking crab was a tedious and demanding job : a dozen crabs produced only a handful of meat . But when she took this meat , as her mother had taught her , and mixed it with herbs and vegetables and corn meal , and formed it into small cakes and fried them in sizzling bear fat , she produced one of the finest dishes this river would ever know . Cakes of crab , ' she called them , and Pentaquod found them subtle and delicious . There is better , ' Navitan assured him , and when he doubted , she told him to wait until the crabs began to shed , and one day she brought him  | four that had newly cast their shells , and these she fried directly in hot bear grease , without first boiling or picking them . Do I eat legs and all ? ' Pentaquod asked , and she goaded him into trying them ; when he had finished the four he declared them succulent beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navitan said . While Pentaquod was initiating himself into such pleasant customs he made a discovery which disturbed him : he found that what Scar-chin had reported was true . This tribe never defended itself from enemies , and when the Susquehannocks intruded from the north , or the Nanticokes from the south , no attempt was made to protect the village . The villagers seemed not to care what happened ; they mounted no sentries , sent no patrols to check the frontiers , engaged in no self-defense maneuvers . He was not surprised , therefore , when children ran in one morning to report , Here come the Nanticokes again ! ' No one panicked . Everyone placed essential goods in deerskin pouches , hid supplies of food in the nearby forest , and fled . The werowance marched at the front of his people , as gallantly as if heading for battle , and took them deep into the fragmented , river-cut area northwest of their village . They had learned from frequent experience that the Nanticokes were reluctant to follow them into that chopped-up area , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval , during which the invaders would steal everything left behind and then retreat singing victory songs , they could return to their homes and resume life as it had been . Pentaquod was staggered by this attitude . When the children first reported the invasion he had wanted to storm out to engage the enemy , teach them a lesson and drive them back to the southern regions , but the old werowance would have none of this , nor did any of his people wish to face the sturdier men from the south . What do we lose , doing it this way ? ' one of the women asked Pentaquod as they fled to the land of the broken rivers . We lose my wigwam , ' he said in some anger . A wigwam we can build in a day . The dried fish ? Who cares . The salted duck they wo n't find . We stowed it among the oaks . ' When the tribe had hidden for seven days , it was deemed likely that the Nanticokes had done their damage and retreated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to ensure that they had really gone . No volunteers offered to do the spying , so Pentaquod , speaking for Scarchin , said , We 'll go . ' The interpreter , who had been captured once , wanted nothing to do with such a venture , but Pentaquod insisted , and since going in the company of this brave Susquehannock would lend distinction to the little man , he reluctantly agreed .  | No spy in the long history of the region ever moved with more circumspection than Scar-chin as he entered the territory occupied by the invaders . Indeed , he was so painfully careful not to snap a twig that Pentaquod realized the little fellow 's crafty plan : he would move so slowly that the Nanticokes would have two extra days to clear out . When he and Pentaquod did finally reach the village site , the enemy would be practically back in their own villages . But Pentaquod would have none of this , and was determined to press forward to see what kind of people the Nanticokes were . But he was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn , no appeal to Scar-chin 's manhood prevailed . The little man refused to move forward ahead of the prudent schedule he had set himself , and in the end he attached himself to a locust tree and could not be budged , so Pentaquod moved alone to the river . From a vantage point he observed the tag end of the Nanticokes as they rummaged one last time through the captured village , collecting final souvenirs of their raid . While the main body rambled east along the river , chanting a victory song which told of how they had subdued the fiercely resisting village , four laggards remained behind , wrestling with some captured article too big for them to handle . Pentaquod , watching them with amusement , could not resist making an arrogant gesture , even though he knew it was foolish and risky . Leaping from behind a tree , he uttered his wildest war cry , brandished his spear and lunged at the four startled Nanticokes . They were terrified by this apparition , five hands taller than they and much broader of shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to shout to those ahead , The Susquehannocks ! ' and terror ensued . The entire foraging party fell into panic , abandoning whatever they had stolen , and with great clatter stormed and thrashed their way in undignified retreat . So definitive were the sounds of defeat that even Scar-chin was lured from his hiding place in time to see his friend Pentaquod brandishing his spear and chasing an entire Nanticoke army through the woods . It had never occurred to Scar-chin that one resolute man might be the equal of four surprised Nanticokes or forty frightened ones , but when he saw the retreating feathers of the southern braves he realized that he had witnessed a miracle , and he began fashioning the ballad that would immortalize the victory of Pentaquod : Fearless he strode among the robbers , Strong he faced the innumerable enemy , Thoughtless of danger he engaged them , Throwing the bodies up and over , Smashing the heads and twisting the legs CHESAPEAKE / 32 Till the exhausted foe screamed and trembled , Beseeching mercy , kissing his hands in fear .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exalted woodland tradition , and as Pentaquod casually surveyed the trivial damage done his village and his wigwam , he listened with amusement to the chant . It reminded him of the war songs he had heard as a boy , when the Susquehannocks returned from their forays against the tribes to the south ; those songs had depicted events of unbelievable heroism , and he had believed them : Now the bravest of the brave Susquehannocks , Cherodah and Mataloak and Wissikan and Nantiquod Creep through the forest , spy out the fortress And leap with violent bravery upon the foe .. . And it now dawned upon Pentaquod that the village his ancestors had attacked with such bravery was this village ; the enemies they had subdued were ones they had never faced , for the foe had been hiding in faraway marshes . There had been no battle save in the minds of ancient poets who knew that when braves march forth to battle , it is obligatory that there be victory songs . And yet , even though he knew the fraudulence of such behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this time their goods had not been carried off , they began to chant Scar-chin 's composition and to believe it . With appealing modesty Pentaquod stood silent , allowing Scar-chin to lead the applause . If the village had been saved , Pentaquod reasoned , it was because of my actions , and I will accept the credit . It was that night when the older men began thinking of him as a possible werowance . But when word next reached the tribe that Susquehannocks were moving south , even though Pentaquod assured the villagers that he knew certain tricks which might fend them off  --  provided he could find nine brave men who would not run away  --  the old werowance brusquely countermanded his proposal . The only sensible thing to do is run into the marshes . We have been doing this for many years , and in all that time we have enjoyed a good life , with plenty of food and enough marsh grass to weave again the sides of our burned wigwams . Let the enemy have his triumph , if he needs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange aspect of this policy was that it in no way diminished the self-respect of the villagers , and it certainly did not diminish Pentaquod ; he had proved his valor against the Nanticokes , and Scar-chin had composed the epic . Pentaquod was a true hero , and he did not have to repeat his heroics endlessly to retain his reputation . As he fled with the others into the safety of the southern marshes , every man believed that 33 / THE RIVER if Pentaquod had wanted to oppose the Susquehannocks , he could have done so . Instead he preferred safeguarding his pregnant wife , and this , deemed the villagers , was much more sensible . As they crossed the river , and hid their canoes , and straggled through the rushes that lined the southern shore , Pentaquod heard two tribal tales that fascinated him , and he kept asking the older men numerous questions : You say that to the east , where you go in summer , there is a river much greater than the ones I know ? " The water is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever seen the opposite shore ? ' And it is there , all the time , and a canoe can not cross it ? " What do you mean , waves coming to the shore so high they knock down a man ? ' He was so excited by their descriptions , and so willing to believe because all agreed , that he wanted to set out immediately to see this marvelous thing , but the werowance said , We will be going there in the summer , to escape the mosquitoes . ' So he waited . The other story was incredible , much weightier than the tale of the big river , for it contained disturbing implications . He first caught rumor of it from Scar-chin , who said casually , Maybe when the Great Canoe returns , it will chastise the Susquehannocks . ' What Great Canoe ? ' The one that came many winters ago . ' It came where ? ' Near the island . ' How big was it ? ' I did n't see it , but Orapak did , and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very old man now , to ask directly , Did you see the Great Canoe ? ' I did , ' the old man said as they huddled in the marshes . How big was it ? ' Twenty canoes , forty , piled one on the other . It rose high in the air . ' How many paddlers ? ' None . ' This was the most ominous statement Pentaquod had ever heard , a Great Canoe moving without paddles . He contemplated this for some time , then asked the old man , You saw this thing , yourself , not some great story recited at night ? ' I saw it , beyond the island . ' What did you think of it ? ' The old man 's eyes grew misty as he recalled that stupendous day when his world changed . We were very afraid . All of us , even Orapak . We could not explain what we had seen , but we had seen it . The fear has never left us , but as the years pass we have managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a stranger to the tribe revive those distant fears and he would say no more . CHESAPEAKE / 34 By prudent questioning , Pentaquod satisfied himself that all members of the tribe believed that the Great Canoe had indeed come to the mouth of the river , that it was huge in size , that it moved without paddles . One old woman added to the story : It was white on top , brown at the bottom . ' Pentaquod carried the disquieting news with him as they penetrated deeper into the swamp , and when they reached relatively solid ground on which they could camp , he went to the werowance and asked bluntly , What did you think , Orapak , when you saw the Great Canoe ? ' The old man sucked in his breath , then sat down beneath an oak . He reflected on what he should reply to this penetrating question , knowing that it cut to the heart of his tribe 's existence , then said slowly , I can not come into the marshes again . I find it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . You must be the next werowance . ' I did not ask about that , Orapak . ' But this is the significant answer to what you did ask . ' Of this Pentaquod could make no sense , but the old leader continued , When we gathered on the shore that day to see the Great Canoe as it moved slowly north , all of us saw the same thing . You are probably aware of that from the questions you 've been asking . ' Pentaquod nodded . He was convinced that this tribal memory was no mere chant composed by some imaginative ancestor like Scar-chin . Satisfied on this point , the old man went on , When the others had seen the Canoe , and assured themselves that it was real , they returned home , but my grandfather , the werowance then , took my father and me along the shore , and we were hiding in the forest when the Canoe came close , and we saw that it contained men much like us and yet much different . ' How ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different substance , for the sun glistened when it struck . ' That was all the old man knew , and since none of the others had told him of these startling facts , he realized that this was privileged knowledge , to be possessed only by the succession of werowances . In sharing this sacred knowledge of the glistening bodies , Orapak was passing along to Pentaquod the burden of leadership . He did not need to warn that no mention must be made of what the Great Canoe actually contained , for it was clear that one day it must return , bringing the enigma of men with white skins and bodies that reflected sunlight . They will come back , wo n't they ? ' Pentaquod asked . They will . ' When ? ' Every day of my life I have risen from my bed with one question : Is this the day they will return ? Now that burden is yours . You will never 35 / THE RIVER place your head upon the sleeping reeds without wondering : Will they come tomorrow ? ' place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come tomorrow ? They buried the canny old werowance , a craven who had lost his village a score of times but never a man in battle , deep in the swamps away from the river he had loved . From his tired , worn body they removed the copper disk symbolic of leadership , proffering it to Pentaquod , but he refused , for such disks of authority were not part of the Susquehannock ritual . Instead he planted three tall turkey feathers in his hair , so that he towered even more conspicuously over his little charges , and Scarchin recited his epic of how the new werowance had once defeated the Nanticokes single-handed . And so this tribe became the next in that strange procession of nations who choose as their leader someone who is not even a member of their tribe . The first test of Pentaquod 's leadership came when the Nanticokes marched north on their traditional raid . The women assumed that the tribe would flee north in the accustomed manner , but some of the younger warriors , infected by Scar-chin 's epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan the battle , ' they argued , we could repel the invaders and end our annual shame . ' The idea was tempting to Pentaquod the man , but in his capacity as werowance , on whom the safety of the tribe depended , he had to think more cautiously . He could not casually sacrifice any men , for his was a trivial group , small and frightened and inconsequential . A sore defeat might demoralize them , leaving no base for continued existence . Furthermore , he had achieved his memorable victory over the four Nanticoke warriors by surprise , and he was not at all sure this could be repeated . He told the young warriors , Let us scout the Nanticokes to see how they approach this time . ' So he and two of the most excitable young fighters crept into the woods , went far upstream and swam across the river onto alien land . There they hid until the noisy Nanticokes came into sight , and as Pentaquod had suspected , this time they did not move without sentinels and forerunners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared . The enthusiasm of the young warriors dampened . In some consternation they scurried back to inform the others , They are marching as a well-prepared army . We had better go the rivers . ' And with a very willing Pentaquod in the lead , they fled . When they returned to their village , it was Pentaquod who surveyed the damage ; it was not great but it was humiliating , and he vowed : They will not do this again . That summer he did not allow his people to abandon their land be- cause of the mosquitoes . We will stay here and fortify it . We will lay subtle traps along the approaches , and all men will learn some skill at arms . Anyone who complains of the mosquitoes will get no crab meat . ' It was a trying summer . The mosquitoes were terrible ; at dusk hundreds would land on any exposed arm or face , and people stayed close to smudge pots when the sun went down . They smeared themselves with bear grease , slept with blankets about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept them sweating through the darkness . But they were inspired by the vision held before them by their tall young werowance : When the Nanticokes come this year , what a surprise they will get at this tree ! ' By testing his young men repeatedly , he satisfied himself that they would stand firm and execute their surprise . He used every military idea developed by the Susquehannocks and invented others appropriate to the situation , and when the mosquitoes disappeared in early autumn they left behind a village prepared to defend itself . The young men actually hungered for the Nanticokes to arrive , but some untoward event in the south delayed the customary expedition , and the fledgling warriors chafed . Pentaquod , knowing that he must keep their enthusiasm high , divided his tribe into portions , one marching against the other , and thus they perfected their strategies . And then one cool day at the start of winter , when geese lined the river , / scouts ran in with the long-awaited news : The Nanticokes are coming . ' The southerners came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts in the forefront ; following Pentaquod 's surprising assault on them , they had been attentive to details , but now they were , as he had predicted to his troops , careless once more . They came through the woods like revelers ; they forded the river like people swimming for pleasure ; they straggled down the right bank of the river as if attending a celebration . And then they came to Pentaquod 's carefully disposed troops . From behind trees arrows were launched , and men appeared with spears , while ahead the ground gave way , projecting the forward troops into pits , and strange sounds echoed through the forest , and even women appeared , beating sticks . Confusion and pain captured the Nanticokes , and in the end all they could do was flee , leaving behind more than twenty prisoners . Never had they known such a debacle . The little villagers , finding themselves with an unprecedented victory and also a score of captives , did not know what to do with either . Unaccustomed to war other than the retreats it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with prisoners , and when Pentaquod explained that in the north his Susquehannocks followed three courses of action , they listened attentively . The wounded we kill . The strong we turn into slaves . The swift we send back to their people with insulting messages . '  | The villagers nodded approval of these suggestions , completely unaware of what they entailed , but their werowance continued , However , we wounded no one , so there are none to kill . ' Most of them saw the common sense of this judgment , and indeed applauded it because they had no taste for killing . We do not need slaves , because there is no work for them to do , and if we made work , we would also have to make meals for them . ' This , too , was irrefutable . And I do not think we ought to send insulting messages to the Nanticokes . We want them for our friends , not our enemies . ' To some , this was a surprising verdict . Many , especially those who had not participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had devised clever ways for doing so ; they were disgusted that Pentaquod should preach conciliation , but he received support from a strange quarter . Two young warriors who had stood behind the first tree where the traps were sprung confessed that they had been terrified , and that if even one thing had gone wrong , they would have been surrounded and killed . It is much better for the Nanticokes to come as friends , ' they reasoned . Let us feast the prisoners and talk with them and send them south with our respect . ' As soon as the words were spoken Pentaquod cried , Let us do just that ! ' and his counsel prevailed , and the feast was held with goose and deer and yams and baked fish and pumpkin sweetened with the juice of cornstalks , and tobacco was smoked in long pipes which passed from hand to hand . One of the Nanticokes of good family said at the conclusion , We will inform our people that we are no longer enemies , ' and the sun rose before the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of profound excitement in the village , and talk became heady . Never again will we desert our village to the Nanticokes . We have proved that we can fight better than those fools . One of these days we 'll march south to their villages , and they 'll see what a change has occurred . ' Pentaquod took no notice of this bombast ; he recognized it as the boastfulness which Susquehannock warriors had engaged in when he was a boy , but when he heard his people tell one another that the entire system of the world was altered by their victory , he became worried . And when they boasted that next time the Susquehannocks marched down from the north there would be war , he called a halt . The Susquehannocks are not Nanticokes , ' he warned . Not one of our tricks would fool them , because they are Susquehannock tricks , and they use them against their enemies . ' He harangued them for an extended period , and then a happy metaphor came to him . Lowering his voice and leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Among  | the Susquehannocks , I was a small man . ' His height was so great as he said this , his torso so much broader than theirs , that they could only gasp . What shall we do when they come again ? ' they asked , subdued . We shall cross the river , hide our canoes and go into the swamps , ' he said , and into the swamps he led them . In the decade that followed ? 1586 ? 1595 by western calendar  --  Pentaquod became the best werowance his people had ever known . He was a tall , courageous , kindly man serving among a small , frightened people . When his tribe went east to the Great Waters , he led the way and carried his share of the burdens , and on the rare occasions when they had to flee into the southern marshes , his ability to absorb such ignominy without losing good spirits inspired them . They no longer had to hide in the northern rivers , because he had arranged lasting peace with the Nanticokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried deer meat to the Nanticokes , bright shells for roanoke to the villagers . There were even exchanges of visits , which were salutary , for the returning villagers boasted with perverse pride , Our mosquitoes are twice as fierce as theirs . ' Pentaquod and Navitan had a son to inherit the title , and then another , and all things prospered . He led his people east to the supreme river and watched as its salty waves came higher than his head to thunder upon the shore in shattering power . As he stood transfixed one day an illumination came to him : If the Great Canoe we await is able to move across this river of such tremendous power , it must be of vast size and the men who steer it must be even greater than the Susquehannocks . And he looked upon the ocean with dismay and wonderment . There were other mysteries . At far-spread intervals on some starless night a child would cry , The light is there ! ' and in the forest across the river would come a single glimmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to rest , glowing ominously through the dark passage of night . In the village parents hushed their children , and no one spoke of it . Through the long darkness the little people remained at water 's edge , staring obsessively , wondering who or what could be moving on the southern shore , but there was never a satisfactory explanation , merely that flickering light emanating from some unknown source . Toward dawn it would vanish and not reappear for many years . A greater mystery concerned the bay . It lay only a short distance to the west , but rarely did a villager see it and never did they venture upon it . In all their generations of living beside water , they had not discovered the sail , nor the fact that men could move across rivers and bays without paddling ; to them the bay was alien . Its abundance of fish and crabs and  | oysters was proscribed , and all they knew of this great river of rivers was that it was the route by which the fierce Potomacs attacked . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enemies , and never did they know the grandeur of sunset on broad waters or the rising of a sudden storm . It was believed by the villagers that on those nights when portentous affairs impended , Fishing-long-legs would come to the river as the stars were beginning to fade , uttering mournful kraannks to warn of imminent wonders . Then the people would huddle in the darkness , listening with terror to the sounds that echoed from the trees bending over the water . On one such night in 1596 , when distant nations were preparing to invade the bay , blue herons flew in great numbers from the swamps , scattering over the landscape before dawn to search the estuaries for swift-moving fish . Their cries filled the night , but if they distressed those men and women of evil conscience and with something to fear , they caused no apprehension in Pentaquod , because he knew that they had flocked to signal the birth of his third child , and before sunrise he heard the reassuring cry . A girl ! ' the midwife reported as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pentaquod replied gravely , but he was far more than that . He had always wanted a daughter who would comfort him when he retired from war , and at last he had one . As soon as it was respectable for him to visit the birthing hut , he stooped low , passed beneath the pine boughs and chains of acorns to take the hands of his wife . I am content , ' he said and he was permitted to see the new child , so small that it was hard to believe she was his offspring . Holding his two forefingers apart , he indicated to his happy wife how really minute this child was , not at all like her two brothers at that age . He laughed , then lifted the tiny thing and held it against his cheek . Her name shall be Tciblento , ' he said , and she became the most precious thing in his life , the joy of his later years . He taught her the lore of the river : where the geese clustered , and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut for a wigwam , and how to burn out the heart of a tree in order to make a canoe . She learned to dive for oysters and fish for crabs , and with his urging she became an excellent cook . But it was the grace of her movements that delighted him ; she was as deft in dodging among trees as a fawn . The soft color of her skin was like a deer 's , too , and she was never more beautiful than when she appeared suddenly from behind some tree as they were working in the forest  --  unexpected , bright of eye , quick of gesture . Once as he worked among the trees , seeking pines from which canoes could be burned , he found her sleeping on a bed of needles , her hair thrown carelessly across her breast . Tears came into his eyes and he whispered , Tciblento , Tciblento , why were you born into the days of  | change ? ' He could foresee that in her lifetime the Great Canoe would return , imposing fearful difficulties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring . As he watched , a blue heron landed , uttering its mournful kraannk , and without waking she twisted an end of hair . Herons did not cry at random ; they sent warnings . And he remembered that on the night of her birth the Choptanks had been warned . It must be understood that this small tribe did not refer to itself as the Choptanks ; that name would come much later and from strangers . No congregation so inconsequential would presume to appropriate a name . It was proper for others to do so , like the powerful Susquehannocks ( from the smooth flowing stream ) or the crafty Nanticokes ( those who ply the tidewaters ) or the brutal Potomacs who ruled across the bay ( those who live where the goods are brought in ) . But Pentaquod 's little group of inept fishermen referred to themselves as We , or Us , or , sometimes , The People . By the world they would be remembered as Choptanks . Nor did they call their river by that name ; indeed , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant beginning and a termination in the bay . They were content to know their little stretch of it and would have been astonished to learn that they commanded an entire water system which would one day be known by their name . Nameless little people living upon a nameless river , they were destined to endow their somnolent region with one of the world 's most tantalizing titles : Choptank . The word must have had a meaning at some point ; if so , it has been forgotten . A very old woman once said that it meant where the water flows back strongly , but she could explain nothing . Pentaquod 's two sons were now developing into responsible young adults , and Tciblento was an eight-year-old marvel , not so tall as her brothers but much quicker in mastering the lessons her father taught . She had begun to wear her long black hair in braids and had a saucy way of cocking her head when listening to elders . Her father delighted in his children , and it was partly because of wanting to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oration : Your food supplies have never been more secure , and your village is no longer ravaged by Nanticokes . Never has your river known a happier time , with crabs for all in the summer and beaver pelts in winter to keep you warm . I have served with you long enough . The time is at hand when you must select one of your own people as werowance . ' Uneasiness followed this announcement , for the little people realized that without his towering guidance they might revert to the old days of  | fear and flight . The Nanticokes would learn that he was no longer leading the tribe and might conclude that continuing the peace was not in their interest , but the tall Susquehannock was insistent . Then he gave his reasons : ' Whenever , in the old days , we fled to the northern rivers I watched one spot where two waters meet , and I have always wanted to live there with Navitan and the children . When I first came to your river I lived on the island where Fishing-long-legs instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how beautiful this land can be , and in the marsh where Onk-or the goose came to see me , and then in this mysterious village where no people lived . I am a man who likes to live apart , and I feel a deep urge to build my wigwam between the two waters . ' ' Who will be our werowance ? ' they asked , and he told them that they should select a young man who could serve them for two generations , and when they protested that they had never chosen their leader before , he allowed his eyes to wander over the frightened crowd . They came to rest on Matapank , who had stood beside him in battle , and when the villagers realized that Pentaquod had indicated his choice , they shouted , ' Matapank ! ' and were gratified . Pentaquod believed that once he announced his decision to leave , he should do so in a hurry , for if he lingered , he would detract from the importance of the new werowance . Accordingly , he gave Matapank an intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined him in a canoe and paddled downriver past the island to the margin of the bay . There , as the canoe drifted idly , he handed over the hidden burden of leadership . ' You 've heard of the time when the Great Canoe came into these waters . ' The new werowance nodded . ' What you have n't heard is that when it moved along the shore Orapak , who was a boy then , and his grandfather , who was the werowance , crept behind trees and spied upon the people in the canoe . ' Matapank pursed his lips ; he knew the traditions of his tribe , but of such an adventure he had not heard . ' What did they see ? ' ' The people in the canoe had fair skins , not like us , and they had different bodies . ' ' In what way ? ' ' They glistened . When the sun struck their bodies , they glistened . ' Pentaquod allowed this information to sink in , then added , ' And the Great Canoe moved without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were involved , and the young leader could make nothing of them . Then Pentaquod added his last intelligence : ' One day that canoe will return , and we shall  | be dealing with people entirely different . . . white skins . . . glistening bodies . ' Matapank had been eager to take on the responsibilities of leadership , but these new factors evoked apprehension . When they come , will you help me ? ' They may not come in my lifetime , ' Pentaquod said . I think they will , ' the young man replied . ' Why ? ' Long ago I dreamed that I would be the werowance . It happened . And at the same time I dreamed that others came to the river , neither Nanticokes nor Susquehannocks . And they will come . ' Pentaquod liked this response . The leader of a tribe should be one who has visions of the future , who can adjust his thinking to developments which he knows to be inevitable . In his case he had known from the start that peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werowance had led in that direction . He had also known that his pitiful little tribe could never defeat the Susquehannocks , and he had kept them from making that fatal effort . ' You are ready to lead , ' he told Matapank as they allowed the canoe to drift , and when they reached shore he handed the new leader a cherished talisman , which he had kept hidden for this moment : the copper disk long worn by the werowance of this tribe . Then he promised , If the strange ones return while I am alive , I will help . ' That day he and his family left the village . Putting aside his three turkey feathers , he led his family to a pair of sturdy canoes , one burned from oak , one from pine , and together they paddled west past the marshes and around the white cliffs into a beautiful small river . When they had penetrated for some distance , they came to a secondary stream leading inland , and when they had gone up this short way it bifurcated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago . Tree-covered , it projected south , to be warmed by the sun in winter . There were no marshes in which mosquitoes could breed , but enough deep salt water to produce oysters and crabs . In the forest there would be deer , and on all the waters geese . It was as fine a setting as the Choptank provided , a refuge with visible security and never-ending beauty . From the point on which Pentaquod and his sons erected their three wigwams the family could look down a broad perspective of the stream to the river and the distant pine trees lining the invisible Choptank . Here Pentaquod spent the two happiest years of his life , 1605 and i6o6 in the western calendar . He was older now and slightly stooped ; his great broad face was deeply etched from years of leadership , and his hair was white . But he felt young , for his oldest son had left the refuge one summer 's day to paddle back to the village , and when he returned he  | brought with him the sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandson , longer and sturdier than the usual Choptank baby . He 's to be a fine hunter ! ' Pentaquod predicted , and before the child could crawl the grandfather was making arrows for him . But in the next year a canoe came rushing up the creek , and even before it reached land the breathless paddlers shouted in a mixture of confusion and fear , Pentaquod ! The Great Canoe has come ! ' He was forty-nine that year of 1607 , a man who had earned repose , but when this long-anticipated information reverberated through the forest , he did what he had always known he must eventually do : he put on his turkey feathers , told his family to pack and ordered them to follow as soon as possible . Almost eagerly , like a young buck bursting into a new meadow , his antlers ready , he jumped into the messengers ' canoe and headed back to the village . It was as if he had consciously retired from leadership two years before in order to husband his strength and purify his understandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared . But as the canoe left the small stream to enter the river which would take him to his new responsibilities , he looked back with sorrow and longing at the peninsula which he had transformed . He would not see it again , and he knew this , for with the arrival of the Great Canoe not only would his paradise be lost , but that of all the Choptanks.  | ' ON A COLD , BLUSTERY DAY IN MID-DECEMBER 1606 Captain John Smith , a short , choleric , opinionated little man with a beard and a fiery temper , assembled seven daring gentlemen on a dock in the Blackwall section of London and addressed them in crisp terms : I have brought you to inspect the vessels in which we shall conquer Virginia . ' And he showed them the three small ships that would carry them to the New World , calling off their names : Susan Constant , one hundred tons . Godspeed , forty tons . The little pinnace Discovery , twenty tons . And down here , at the end , the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , riding on the Thames at the foot of the dock , a small double-ended , single-masted open shallop twenty-three feet long with eight ominous oars . You , Edmund Steed , jump in , ' Smith commanded , and a fair young man of twenty-five , dressed in the clothes of a scholar , obeyed . Soon all seven were aboard manning their oars while Captain Smith , barely five feet tall , stood approvingly on the dock , watching the little craft adjust to the weight . Sturdy vessel ! ' he cried , snapping his words as if issuing a command . Then , drawing himself to maximum height , he saluted the boat . He was twenty-six that winter  --  difficult , vain , unbearably ambitious . He had , by his account , already survived dangers that would have destroyed an ordinary man : mercenary in the most brutal years of the German wars , heroic defender of Christianity when the Muhammadans invaded Hungary , captured slave immured in a Turkish dungeon , foottraveler to Muscovy and Madrid . And now he surveyed his fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new colony , the subjugation of a new world . We 're off ! ' he shouted as he jumped into the shallop . Grabbing the  | eighth oar , he began rowing with an energy that shamed the others , and soon they were moving briskly down the Thames . When they passed the three larger ships Smith yelled , Mister Steed , have you handled sail ? ' That I have not , sir , ' the scholar replied , at which Smith bellowed , Then stand clear as Mister Momford runs it up . ' And a gentleman who had knowledge of boats manipulated the sheets so that a fore-and-aft sail climbed the mast . With it in place , the shallop moved so smartly that rowing was no longer required . Ship the oars ! ' Smith ordered , but since the gentlemen were unfamiliar with this command , confusion resulted . Bring in the oars ! ' Smith roared , and they were shipped , as he had wanted . When the brief trip was completed , with the shallop safely in dock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little craft ashore , after which he handed Steed and Momford buckets of paint and brushes , instructing them to number every board used in construction of the boat . Each is to have its proper number , at four different spots , indicating its relation to every other board that touches it . ' When this curious task was completed he summoned carpenters , who dismantled the boat , knocking out nails and wooden wedges until only piles of timber lay on the dock . These he ordered tied in lots and carried aboard the Susan Constant , where they were stowed below decks , and when all was secure , Smith led Steed to the edge of the hold in which they could see the bundled spars . An idea of mine , ' he said . Conceived while imprisoned in a Turkish harem , ' and once more he saluted the boat which would play so crucial a role in establishing the Virginia Colony . Because of his arrogance and vile temper , Captain Smith fared poorly in Jamestown . Thrown in jail for attempted mutiny , captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and actually led to the gibbet to be hanged for insubordination , he was saved by a last-minute revelation . Cocksure and prescient , he survived travail , gave the colony the iron leadership it required , and found time to pursue his major preoccupation : the exploration of the Chesapeake . This is a noble sea , ' he told his men at night , after the day 's work ended . Calm and hospitable , majestic in size . Its potential can not be imagined . ' He had already mounted two preliminary explorations and was encouraged by what he had found : broad rivers , innumerable harbors , a plenitude of fish and crabs , and meadows yearning to be cultivated . But his two preconceived targets had eluded him : he had not found a passage to India , he had not uncovered the gold and silver which were known to exist somewhere along the shores of the Chesapeake . Infuriating , ' he growled one July day in i6o8 . Three years ago I heard CHESAPEAKE / 46 the facts for myself . The leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so a noble lord and I attended a play , very little substance and I was about to leave , for I do not waste my time idly . But destiny tugged my sleeve and kept me . . . for a purpose . An actor in this play strode to the edge of the stage and orated directly at me , none other . He spoke of Virginia and told me what I should find here . Silver more common than copper . Kitchen pans and bedroom pots made of pure gold . Rubies and diamonds in the streets . Children gathering pearls along the streams . The riches are here , if only we can find them . ' On Saturday , August 9 , he outlined his plan : The gold lies , I am convinced , in towns hidden along the eastern shore of the bay , and there we shall explore most carefully . The passage to India probably starts from the northern tip , so after we have found our gold we shall probe north to identify the passage , then return to Jamestown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent strategy , and on Sunday all sixteen  --  seven gentlemen , eight sailors and Captain Smith  --  attended church , where long prayers were uttered , and on the morning of August ii he marched his crew to the banks of the James , where he addressed them in solemn tones : We shall be gone thirty days , and at the end you will wish it had been ninety . ' He then ordered his fifteen hands into the reassembled shallop , directed them to take up their oars , and stood like Alexander the Great in the bow of the boat , looking for new horizons . Among the gentleman rowers Edmund Steed , who had not participated in Smith 's two earlier explorations , had been selected for a particular purpose . Smith had not been entirely pleased with the narrative reports of his first journeys ; they had been geographically accurate but had paid insufficient attention to his moral and heroic qualities . This time he was determined that his accomplishments be presented with proper flourishes . Steed came from an ancient Devon family and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with classical allusions and showed a proper respect for the captain . Both on the Susan Constant and ashore at Jamestown he attracted attention , and Smith now assured him , I seek only an accurate account of what occurs during our exploration . Strict attention to where we sail and special detail when we move ashore . ' He paused as Mister Momford prepared to break out the sail , then added confidentially , And it would be prudent if you paid attention to the words and heroic deeds of the commander . ' Steed understood . He had always been properly attentive whenever Smith entertained his companions with reports of his adventures in Hungary . . . his painful months undergoing Turkish tortures . . . his romantic escapes in Muscovy . . . his daring in Spain . Steed sometimes marveled that a man only a year older than himself should have experienced so much , and he might have been tempted to brand the little  | warrior a liar except for the fact that Smith always spoke with an inherent veracity . His tales sounded true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really been to the places whose names rolled off his tongue , for he gave the temperature , and how the city lay in relation to its river , and what his captors wore and which specific weapons were carried by the enemies he had slain in hand-to-hand combat . Steed 's belief in his commander stemmed from an incident which had occurred during the long voyage from England , when Smith told in one brief afternoon of wild adventure in four different lands , ending with Spain , and Steed had thought : I 'll wager he never touched foot in Spain , the braggart . But then the little captain , as if alerted to the fact that an unbeliever lurked among his hearers , closed with a remarkable evoca-tion : And of all the cities I was to see in my travels , the one I remember most fondly is the dusty town that lies at the mouth of the great river leading to Sevilla in Spain . Sanhicar de Barrameda is its name , and it holds the left bank of Wady-al-Quivir , as they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many grazing fields nearby and vast swamps filled with birds . It 's favorably regarded by sailors for the delicious pale wine its vintners make , for there is a square near the center of Sanlucar where the wine-men sell their goods , accompanied by a salty little fish they call the anchoovy . I tasted the fish but not the wine . ' The words rang like a bell at dusk , and Steed abandoned any doubts he may have had . Smith might not have been prisoner in a Turkish harem , and he probably did not kill three adversaries during a horseback tournament with lances , but that he had visited a dusty Spanish town at the mouth of a river , no one could deny . As Jamestown disappeared behind a bend , Steed took careful note of the shallop lest he omit significant details : no decking , no refuge from storms , barrels of bread already turning sour , a batch of dried meats , some with worms , and a large supply of fishing lines . There 'll be plenty of fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the frayed sail aloft , Steed took note that it had been mended twice . Such deficiencies he intended to report , for their existence would make the captain 's ultimate discovery of gold and the passage even more impressive . If the gentlemen and the sailors felt any apprehension about exploring with such inadequate gear , their captain did not . His buoyancy was remarkable , and when the shallop responded nicely to the wind he cried , Fairly launched ! It 's to be a famous journey ! ' Steed wrote down these CHESAPEAKE / 48 remarks and others on the folded sheets he carried in a canvas bag , and that night he transcribed them into a proper journal , which Captain Smith reached for as soon as it was completed . He did not like what he saw . He did not like it at all . The geographical facts were accurate enough , but he was chagrined that he should have misjudged Steed 's talents by such a margin , and with the forthrightness which characterized him , he broached the subject . Mister Steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me saying , " We shall be gone thirty days , and at the end you will wish it had been ninety . " That 's a poor speech for the launching of a great adventure . ' It 's what you said , sir . ' I know . But our time onshore was brief . You must take that into consideration . ' And he grabbed the pen from his scribe and sat for some time beneath the swaying lantern , composing a more appropriate opening address : As the day was far advanced and time precious , Captain Smith gathered his sturdy crew beside the shallop and told them , Men , we set forth this day on a journey of exploration which will dazzle the courts of Europe . In Virginia we shall find gold and silver . It may be we shall uncover the hidden passage to the treasures of India and China . We shall garner the aromatic spices of the islands . We shall penetrate to where no Englishmen have gone before , and we shall return with jewels and rare cloths to gladden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further the Glory of God , to carry His Word to lands which know it not , and to bring everlasting greatness to our beloved King James , late of Scotland but now of all Britain . With a flourish Captain Smith shoved the paper back to his scribe , who held it near the lantern , his blond features betraying the astonishment he felt as he read the captain 's corrections . You never said those things , Captain . ' I was thinking them , ' Smith snapped . Had there been time , I 'd have said them . ' Steed was about to protest when he looked into the shadows and saw the bearded face of his little commander . It was like iron edged with oak , and he realized that Smith would have made just such a speech had the occasion permitted , and he sensed that it was not what a soldier said , but what he intended , which provided motivation . John Smith lived intimately with possibilities that other men could not even imagine , and in his dreaming he forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be in a leaky shallop with poor food and no protection , exploring a land-locked bay ; Smith was already through the northwest passage and far into the Pacific , riding a caravel.  | On the seventh day of the journey Steed caught a glimpse of the real John Smith and of the island that would command his own attention for the rest of his life . They had been picking their way fruitlessly up the eastern shore , dropping into one disappointing river after another , making desultory contact with Indians who had never seen iron , let alone gold or silver , and Steed had written : Wicomico and Nanticoke , we explored these rivers for miles , trusting to find some city of richness where the chamber pots were made of gold , but we found instead only the meanest Indian villages populated by savages with knowledge of nothing . Our heroic captain never lost heart and distinguished himself by trading cleverly for potatoes and lengths of roanoke to be used against the tribes near Jamestown . It was while conducting such trades with the Nanticokes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choptank , whose capital city called Patamoke is known to have much gold . So the shallop sailed north with its cadre of excited explorers , and when a great broad river was sighted , Smith cried , This is our Choptank ! Here is Patamoke , city of gold ! ' But as the little boat breasted the southern headland protecting the river , Edmund Steed saw his island : delicate in outline , secured within the river , perfected by a crown of trees . Captain Smith , ' he called , have you ever seen a fairer island ? ' and the little warrior studied the land from several angles and said , Too low for a fort . ' It required about four hours for the slow-moving shallop to approach and pass the island , and during all that time Steed leaned on one of the sheer strakes and stared . He saw numerous indentations at which they could have landed , had Captain Smith been so inclined , and trees of noble height and even a small river leading into the heart of the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought : This is the best of England transported across the sea . I shall name it Devon . That evening the shallop anchored well into the Choptank , under the protection of a white cliff , and while one assignment of men tried to catch fish for supper a party of Indians appeared in two canoes , announcing in sign language that their werowance desired the leader of the strangers to accompany them to their capital city , where they would be welcomed . Night fell as the Englishmen debated whether or not their captain should risk such a journey , and many opinions were offered , for the invitation posed difficult problems , as Steed reported : In the darkness we could not see the waiting Indians nor have any indication of their intentions , but they could see us , for our mast was outlined against the sky . Thomas Momford pointed out that Cap- tain Smith had twice been lured into traps like this and had , indeed , been captive of Powhatan , leading chief on the western shore . This remembrance encouraged Captain Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone to be brought in , and I was stretched across them , and a brave stood above me with his warclub ready to strike out my brains , when a miracle took place and I was saved . ' Steed had heard this story five times now ; he was convinced that Smith thought the affair had happened that way , but he was far from sure it had . And then , toward dawn , Smith made his decision : He told us simply , I must go to the City of Patamoke , for it is there we shall find the gold . ' No argument would dissuade him , and when light broke he nominated Chirurgeon Ragnall and Edmund Steed to accompany him . As we climbed into the waiting canoe Thomas Momford cried , Take care , Captain ! ' and Smith replied , A captain must never fear to meet a captain . ' The short trip from the cliff to the city was one of intense excitement , for Captain Smith could smell gold , and in his anticipation he told Steed , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and you march behind with Ragnall in proper form to impress them with our military bearing . ' Steed took notes of what happened : After passing a huge marsh filled with birds and waving brushes , we approached our long-desired goal , the City of Patamoke , headquarters of the powerful Choptanks who control this river , and our hearts beat fast . Captain Smith , always protecting himself from unexpected attack , leaned forward in the canoe to catch a first sight of the settlement , and when he saw only a circle of wigwams , a mound of oyster shells and nothing more he looked at his companions blankly . Ashore we faced a new confusion . We identified the werowance immediately , because of the copper disk he wore upon his chest . His name was Matapank , and he impressed us little , for since he lacked both dignity and authority , he was reluctant to make decisions . He was accompanied , however , by a gigantic white-haired Indian wearing three turkey feathers in his hair , and this man , whose name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , no silver , no pearls , no rubies , no emeralds . Even the copper of the disk had been traded for . The Indians were small and lacking in dignity , except the one man Pintakood , whose daughter of some twelve years stayed with him , as handsome as he .  | Captain Smith , sorely disappointed with this pitiful village , felt that he must at least go through the motions of an exploration , so he produced from his canvas bag an assortment of attractive items : glass beads from Venice , an iron hatchet , eighteen lengths of highly colored cloth , and for the werowance a final present which captivated all the Indians . It was a small ivory object , hinged at one side with a metal lid , which , when raised , disclosed a polished glass , covering something unbelievable : a needle , thin and delicate , resting on a pivot so that no matter how the ivory case was turned , this dancing needle found its way back to one constant position . What could this be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in circles and watched as the needle danced home to its assigned position . He was bewildered . Those about him were more impressed by the fact that they could see the needle  --  clearly they could see it  --  but the invisible glass prevented them from touching it , and this , too , was a miracle . The lesser Choptanks wanted to pass the gift from hand to hand , but the werowance would not surrender it . Then Smith spoke . Knowing not a word of their language , he used a minimum of gestures to indicate the sky , the darkness of night and the stars which formed the Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major . His gestures were incomprehensible to the young werowance , but the giant with the turkey feathers studied closely , then suddenly reached for a stick and drew in the dust the seven stars of the Big Dipper . Yes ! ' Smith shouted , pointing to the heavens . And with his forefinger he indicated how the constellation pointed to the North Star , but this was unnecessary , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that the needle sought north , and Smith nodded . A feast was held at noon , with bear meat and cakes of crab , after which Captain Smith dispatched Chirurgeon Ragnall back to the shallop with news that all was well ; he and Steed would spend the night with the werowance . Ragnall protested that the captain might be falling into yet another trap , but Smith ignored him , and that night , as the summer stars appeared , Steed sat with the daughter of the tall man with the turkey feathers . Her name , he deduced after she had pronounced it for him numerous times , was something like Tsiblinti , and she fed him an exciting mixture of corn and beans which she called succotash , if he had the word right . When they returned to the shallop he faced the exacting task of describing this adventure . He wanted to be accurate and to report the placid quality of this Indian village , yet he knew that he must also display Captain Smith in heroic posture , and this was difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his displeasure . You want to name the island Devon ? And so it shall be , but would  | it not be wiser to show in the record that this was my decision , not yours ? ' I merely proposed it , sir . Confirmation is left to you . ' Confirmed , but I would prefer the record to show that the suggestion came from me , too . ' It will be noted . ' Then Smith frowned and pointed to the real trouble . You spend too few words on our departure . You must recall , for you were involved , what a risky business we undertook . It is no mean task for three men to go unarmed into the heart of hostile Indian territory . ' Steed was about to say that he had never seen people less hostile , Indian or not , but he deemed it wiser to keep his silence . Passing the pages over to the captain , he held the lantern so that Smith could edit them , and after a while he was handed this : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , the river of the Choptanks , at whose mouth stands a most beautiful low island with fair meadows and goodly tall trees . We saw fresh waters running through the woods and all men were ravished at the sight thereof . It minded us of the fair lands of Devon and Captain Smith named the island in their honor . After we had passed this island and proceeded a goodly distance up the Choptank we were accosted by a group of fierce and hostile Indians , and the Captain appreciated at once that our safety depended upon how we dealt with these savages , who could have killed our little band supposing they had wished . He therefore adopted the bold stratagem of demanding that they lead him to their werowance , who was indicated to be at some remove in the capital city of Patamoke . Several men protested the danger of such a journey on his part , pointing out that the savages would outnumber us hundreds to one and could kill us without risk . But Captain Smith was determined to meet the werowance and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he assembled his men and told them , The wise Machiavel in his instruction to princes has properly said that men , iron , money and bread be the necessities of war , but of these four the first two be of most importance , because men and iron can find money and bread , but bread and money never find men and iron . ' Thereafter he stepped boldly forth with Chirurgeon Ragnall and Mister Steed as companions , and cried to the Indians , Take me to Patamoke ! ' We climbed into the enemy 's canoe and went to meet the werowance of the Choptanks . He was a confusing man named Matapank , of little consequence , but in devious manner he masked the real leader , one Pintakood , no brighter than he . The pair were  | much disposed to harm us , but Captain Smith spoke to them with signs and gave them a compass encased in ivory , which much amused them , especially that they could see the needle through the glass but not touch it . They were incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain explained to them what the heavens were and the roundness of the earth , and how the planets danced and the sun did chase the night around the world continually . When Steed read this dumbfounding report he did not know where to begin . It was all true , and at the same time totally false . He skipped the part about the naming of Devon Island ; Captain Smith commanded , and until he confirmed a name , it had not been given . He was also willing to ignore Smith 's claims that the Indians had been hostile ; to one so often the victim of Indian guile they might have seemed so . And he was even content to have the giant warrior with the three turkey feathers appear stupid , because the others were . He thought , with some accuracy : Smith hated the clever Choptank because the Indian was so very tall and he so very short . He wanted him to be stupid . But it did gall the Oxford student to have Smith quoting Machiavelli to inspire his men . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Indians were pressing , and I had not the time . ' Steed made no response , and Smith continued , ' If a captain leads his men into strange waters against a strange enemy , it is wise for him to think of Machiavel . ' At this , Steed stared at the bottom boards , barely discernible in the darkness , but Smith was not content with acquiescence ; he required positive acceptance . With a firm thumb he raised the younger man 's face until stars gleamed upon it and their eyes were level . ' Tell me , Mister Steed , why would I have got into the canoe almost alone , and ventured into the enemy camp ? Men and iron obtain food . It is never the other way around . ' In the dark night the two men glared at each other , with Steed determined to resist the blandishments of his captain . Smith , sensing this , lifted the young man 's head higher and said , ' I insist that you make one more change in the part I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command ? ' ' It is . In your account of our departure with the Indians , I want you to write that you volunteered , most gallantly . ' ' But you commanded me to go . ' ' If I had not , you would have volunteered , because you , like me , are a man of iron . ' Steed made no reply , and Smith moved forward in the shallop , but soon he was back with another emendation . ' Mister Steed , at the moment when I meet the Indian with the turkey feathers , must you emphasize  | the fact that he is so tall and I so short ? ' This time Steed said , My description was ungracious , and I will gladly change it . ' Still Smith was not through . Much later he awakened Steed with this suggestion : I think you should add that Captain Smith was so struck by the giant size of the Indian general that he felt sure the man could not be a Choptank but was probably a Susquehannock . ' Steed could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode easily on the waters of Choptank River he alternated between looking at the silhouette of the island he had named  --  soft and gentle in the night  --  and the dozing figure of his commander . Smith was an enigma , willing to make any alteration in the personal record of the trip , yet insanely determined to be accurate whenever geography was involved . At the entrance to every river he took repeated bearings . Constantly he consulted his compass , asking others to check him . He never entered into the log the height of a tree or the distance to shore without finding confirmation in the estimates of others , and with mapping he was meticulous . If he described the dress of a Choptank , he did so accurately . He was restless in his sleep , and toward dawn came back to tell Steed , I think you can write that we shall not find gold or silver . That dream was vain . ' He spoke these words with such obvious sorrow that Steed shared his heartache , but with the breaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the men , Well , to the westward passage . ' And he sped the shallop north to his next disappointment . He was a severe leader . One evening , as he assembled his company at the mouth of the Susquehanna , he whispered to Steed , I want you to write with special care what I do and say this night . ' He then ordered the gentlemen to stand in one group , the sailors in another , and from the latter he commanded Robert Small to stand forth . When the man had done so he said harshly , Lift your right arm , ' and when the arm was aloft , Smith stood on the fallen trunk of a tree and with a large goblet poured down the man 's arm a large draft of cold water . Refill the goblet , ' he told Steed , and when this was done he ordered the sailor to raise his left arm , whereupon he emptied the water down that sleeve . Tell the assembly what you did to warrant this punishment , ' Smith snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke God 's name in anger ? ' I did , sir . I had caught a large fish and he escaped . ' Return to ranks , Small . ' The little captain then wheeled to address the entire company . If I demand that you conduct yourselves carefully , I have done the same . I have never drunk spirits , nor diced , nor gamed , nor smoked , nor uttered an oath , nor dallied with women , nor in any way diminished myself . I am a soldier , and I hold myself always to be one . If you sail with me , you do not dice or drink or utter oaths. '  | That night , when the writing had been completed to Smith 's satisfaction , he asked Steed , Do you propose becoming a soldier , too ? ' I have not the stomach for it , sir . ' Some do n't . What do you intend ? ' Devon Island is much in my mind . I think to settle there when this trip is done . ' You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , Captain , if the men at Jamestown thought less about patents and permissions . ' To a military man this was an unpalatable doctrine . A soldier identified his king or general , then served him ; patents and proper orders and permissions were the lifeblood of the profession . But he could not expect Steed to understand ; in this young scholar there was something devious , something hidden that Smith had not yet probed , and he was not surprised at the stated plans . The passage to India was not found . The upper end of the bay petered out in a succession of flats and marshes on which the shallop repeatedly grounded , and on the fifth time that sailors swam out with the anchor so that the boat could be kedged , Captain Smith snapped , Mister Steed , tonight you can write that the passage does not exist . . . not for us . ' Never again would he speak of that lost dream . The exploration ended curiously . As the shallop drifted homeward down the western shore , Steed kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken by a fish so large that he could not pull it in , and as he played the creature , Captain Smith reached into the water to help and was struck furiously in the wrist by the tail of a massive stingray . Brushing the fish away , he looked at his arm and watched it begin to swell . Within moments it became immense  --  larger than his thigh  --  and the fingers began to turn purple . The pain was intense , so hurtful that he had to bite upon a piece of wood , and at the end of ninety minutes , when the arm grew darker in color and the pain unbearable , the little captain said to Steed and the surgeon , I am about to die . Dig me a grave from which I can see the bay . ' And a group of sailors dug a grave and Smith marched to it , sitting himself at one end with his feet dangling inside . As he sat there , saying nothing , contemplating the end of his adventures , the pain began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when it became apparent that he would not die , nor lose the arm , he recovered his spirits and asked , Did we land the fish ? ' We did , ' Steed said . Good . I will eat it for my supper . ' It was fried and he ate it . In the closing hours of this disappointing voyage Steed had to acknowledge that he had developed a positive affection for his captain . Smith stood a good four inches shorter than he and weighed fifteen  | pounds less , but he was pure energy , pure dedication to soldiering , and if he constructed entries to make himself seem braver than he had been , this was not ordinary falsification , because if events had demanded heroism , he would have provided it . Steed thought : Smith 's trouble is with words . He demands that they convey what might have been . The last river they visited was the York , and even though the weary sailors were approaching home , they complained bitterly of the food , the rain from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Smith exploded . I could build a new Jerusalem on this bay if only I could find seventeen men unafraid of mosquitoes . ' Disconsolately he walked with Steed along the riverbank until they were hot and weary ; then he fell onto a pile of drying leaves and confessed the failure of his grand designs . I sought brocaded cloths and found Indians wearing matted bark . I sought gold and was rewarded with marshy weeds . This bay has riches , but I was not destined to find them .

King Henry VII , having wrested his throne from the infamous Richard III , ruled with the blessing of the Pope , to whom he willingly accorded both spiritual and temporal allegiance . After years of disturbance the country was at peace , the great monasteries housed clerics of power , and good Englishmen were content to be good Catholics . Martin Luther , who would later challenge this happy somnolence , was then fifteen years old and studying with enthusiasm to be a Catholic priest . Englishmen had been happy , therefore , when in 1489 King Henry announced the formal engagement of his three-year-old son Arthur to the four-year-old Catherine of Spain , daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella , the most Catholic of majesties . This promised union of insignificant England with powerful Spain was a joyous occasion promising many benefits to the smaller island kingdom . Twelve years later , when Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kindly , quiet , well-bred princess who promised to bring love and loyalty to the throne . Young Arthur was enchanted by his first sight of her , and married her gladly in October 1501 , with representatives of the Pope lending official approval to this happy union of two Catholic kingdoms . It was an auspicious start to the new century . ' The Island  | Unfortunately , Arthur , heir to the throne of England , proved sickly , and in March 15o2 he died . His widow , to the disappointment of all , was not pregnant . This left King Henry VII with a nice dynastic problem : if he allowed Princess Catherine to escape England and return to Spain , he would forfeit whatever advantages might have accrued to a Spanish wedding ; but there was no practical excuse for keeping her as a kind of hostage in London to ensure the good behavior of the Spanish monarchs . Clever advisors , of which England seemed always to have an abundant supply , pointed out that the king had one justifiable way of preventing Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur 's brother . ' It was a capital idea , except that Henry , the brother , was only eleven years old , six years younger than his proposed bride . And besides , no sooner had this diplomatic marriage been proposed than thoughtful clerics dismissed it , for it was contrary to church law . Thundered one divine , Leviticus twenty , verse twenty-one clarifies the matter for all time , ' and he quoted the monitory verse in his own rude translation into English : No man shall marry his brother 's widow . It is forbidden . To do so shames his brother 's good name , and the couple shall remain childless . ' Nations had found through sad experience that family life could not be secure if brothers felt free to steal each other 's wives . Royalty in particular had learned that younger brothers must understand from the start that they would not profit from the deaths of their older brothers .

He must take any steps necessary to secure the future of his hard-won crown , and the surest way to accomplish this would be to preserve and reinforce the alliance with Spain . Catherine must be kept in England . So he sought out lesser divines who had not hastily committed themselves when the marriage had first been proposed , and sure enough , when these scholars searched the Bible they uncovered that fortunate passage at Deuteronomy 25:5 which contradicted Leviticus and not only permitted a man to marry his brother 's widow , but actually commanded him to do so . If two brothers dwell together and one of them shall die childless , the widow of the dead man must not marry a stranger . Her dead husband 's brother shall take her as his wife , and have children by her , and perform all the duties of a husband . '  | There could hardly be a more concise instruction than that , or one which covered England 's dynastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud he clapped his hands and ordered an engagement to be arranged for his eleven-year-old son . The king did not live long enough to see his heir happily married ; he died on April 21 , 1509 , and out of respect for his memory  --  for he had been a sturdy king  --  young Henry , against his own best judgment , went ahead with his marriage to a woman six years his elder . The wedding took place a few weeks after the old king 's burial and had happy consequences , except in the matter of providing an heir to the throne . Catherine was fertile enough , and seemed to be constantly pregnant : she bore child after child  --  boys among them  --  but they all died . One sickly daughter , Mary , did survive , but it was not a daughter that Henry sought . In 1533 King Henry belatedly convinced himself that his marriage to this aging Spanish paragon had from the start been illegal and immoral . In the end he returned to Leviticus , abandoning Deuteronomy . With increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find scholars who would support him in his contention that Catherine had never been properly married to him and was therefore technically divorced . He found such scholars , of course , but not of high standing , and the Pope in Rome refused to acquiesce in their findings on various sensible grounds : that whereas the marriage might have been initially suspect , it had been performed ; it had been consummated , as the child Mary proved ; and it had endured for nearly a quarter of a century . Divorce was denied . Now , King Henry was as staunch a Catholic as the kings of Europe provided ; eleven years earlier he had written with his own hand and circulated widely a pamphlet refuting the renegade Martin Luther and reconfirming the leadership of the Pope . In gratitude for this advocacy , the Pope had officially proclaimed Henry Defender of the Faith , ' a cherished title which all future sovereigns of England would hold . Since Henry had proved himself a veritable right hand of the Pope , he could not easily reject the pontiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the doctrines of the church and would have been appalled if anyone had accused him of lacking in enthusiasm for Catholicism . The upshot was that Henry could not divorce Catherine , which meant that he could not marry the toothsome young court attendant on whom his fancy had fallen , Mistress Anne Boleyn . What to do ? One cynic in London whispered , The Pope 's bull has tied up the King 's balls , ' and later , when the issue had been resolved , this witticism would be remembered . The charge against this jokester would first be lese-majeste , later blasphemy , and finally treason , for which he would be strangled in the Tower . For one clever phrase he died . Now the rumor began to circulate that Anne Boleyn was pregnant ,  | with what everyone hoped would be a son , so a speedy resolution of the conflict with the Pope became imperative , lest the future king be born a bastard . The impasse was resolved rather cleverly : King Henry stated that whereas England and all Englishmen remained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual supremacy , they rejected his temporal leadership . Henceforth there would be a Catholic church in various parts of Europe presided over by the Pope , and there would be another in England , equally Catholic but governed in all managerial matters by King Henry . In a blaze of religious fervor he divorced Catherine the Spaniard and married Anne the lusty English girl . This caused such turmoil throughout Europe that he was goaded into proving he really was head of the local church , and he did this by a most practical maneuver . It occurred to him one night as he lay with Anne Boleyn that the Pope controlled more than one third the land of England ; cathedrals , monasteries , churches , nunneries all owned vast estates and the peasants who worked them . With one simple edict Henry expropriated all those holdings , closed down the monasteries , denuded the cathedrals of their lands and , as he said , kicked the monks and friars and nuns into the village streets , forcing them to earn an honest living . ' Then in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he did not keep the new possessions for himself , nor did he deliver them to powerful dukes and earls who might later combine against him ; he handed them instead to those stalwart men of the middle class who had supported him in his fight against the Pope . In this way he converted one third of England into his bounden supporters , and it was during this transfer that the ancestors of Edmund Steed entered the picture . In the County of Devon , southwest of London , in the little town of Bishop 's Nympton , halfway between Dartmoor and Exmoor , there had lived for several hundred years a distinguished and stubborn local family named Steed . They had been farmers of some wealth ; the fathers had served as justices of the peace and the sons had gone off to Oxford . Both sons and daughters had married conservatively , and no scandal had ever touched the family , which , if it had produced no barons or earls , did produce a steady supply of men on whom the kings could rely . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his king , Henry , sought to divorce the Spanish queen . When the debate was most acrimonious , the king sought support from rural gentlemen of good reputation , and Cardinal Wolsey himself , the one who constantly connived to become Pope , asked Steed to rally assistance in his district . Such a request posed a serious moral problem for Steed : he was a devout Catholic , he loved the Pope , he tithed , he led his family to the local chapel every Wednesday and Sunday , and he personally provided the priest 's living . To side with a king against the Pope in an argument  | over the two contrasting verses in the Bible was a most grievous responsibility , and for some weeks he refrained , wrestling with his conscience over that passage in Leviticus which specifically forbade the kind of marriage Henry had been forced into with Catherine . Could it be that the Pope was ignoring the Bible ? Devon Steed would never concede that . But was it not possible that King Henry was right in claiming that he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , due to his incestuous marriage ? Did not Leviticus warn that such a marriage would have no children ? For some days he stood on this precarious ledge , inclining now toward the Pope , now toward Henry . The dilemma was resolved ingeniously : Cardinal Wolsey sent a personal emissary , young Hugh Latimer , related to the Steeds and godfather of Devon 's son Latimer , all the way to Bishop 's Nympton with an argument that could not be refuted : Cousin Steed , are you not aware that our king has already fathered no less than six sons , illegitimately of course , but sons nevertheless . The barrenness can not be his fault . You know Henry Fitzroy , he who was made Duke of Richmond at the age of six . He 's Henry 's son , and so are five others of less degree . If he can shed himself of the Spanish clod and marry lively young Anne , we 'll have a future king , and England will be protected . ' Latimer , an austere man , winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistress Anne is heavy with child right now , a son the midwives assure us , so we must act promptly . ' Satisfied as to the facts , Devon Steed led the western counties in their support of the divorce ; he backed the king against the Pope . He neither solicited nor expected anything in return for having obeyed his conscien. e , but when the dissolution of the monasteries took place , and great estates were distributed to loyal supporters , especially those of the middle class like the Steeds , Hugh Latimer saw to it that his Cousin Devon was placed on the list of eligibles . When agents came to inquire which of the eight hundred monasteries he would prefer , he replied in some innocence , Glastonbury . It 's nearby and I 've always admired the buildings Richard Bere erected there when he was abbot . ' The agent coughed and said , Glastonbury 's so big it 's been reserved . ' I am sorry , ' Steed apologized . What did the king have in mind for me ? ' He rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established localities . Conflicting loyalties , you know . There 's a splendid monastery at Queen 's Wenlock over in Berks . ' I know it ! ' Steed said with enthusiasm . He had stopped there once on his way to Oxford and remembered the place with affection : low towers , a modest cloister , innumerable chimneys , and four noble Gothic arches enclosing the gates at which the poor assembled to receive their charity .  | Fifteen hundred acres accompany the monastery buildings , ' the agent said , and two villages populated with sturdy farmers . You will own the entire as Sir Devon Steed . ' He assumed the knighthood in 1537 as Sir Devon ; he had five Christian names and none of them was Devon . That was a nickname given him at Oxford , and it had become accepted ; now as Sir Devon he moved his family to his new estate . The first thing he did upon arrival at the old monastery , built in 1387 by Good Queen Anne of Bohemia , wife of King Richard II , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt on those ancient and sacred stones he reconfirmed his abiding faith in Catholicism and the spiritual supremacy of the Pope . Nothing changed much , actually . England remained Catholic . King Henry , vastly disappointed when Anne Boleyn gave him another daughter and no son , shortly thereafter had her head chopped off , and again Sir Devon supported him , as did his counterparts in the other 799 expropriated monasteries : they called Boleyn the Whore of the Howards , ' and were glad to see her disposed of . Ugly gossip circulated when certain court circles , always scheming to protect the line of inheritance to the throne , proposed that little Princess Mary , daughter of Henry 's first wife Catherine , be married to the Duke of Richmond , her own half brother . Those who broached the subject to Steed argued , Do n't you see ? This would unite all strands which might have a just claim . The position of the couple would be impregnable , and when they produced a son he would be king in every sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped , he would have two heads . ' Fortunately , King Henry , always a moral man , was revolted at the idea of his daughter 's marrying her illegitimate half brother , and he rejected it . When he heard that Sir Devon Steed at Queen 's Wenlock had rejected the proposal on the same grounds , he felt additional warmth for the new knight and added to his acreage . As long as King Henry lived , Sir Devon experienced no religious pangs . Both he and the king remained devout Catholics , and when the latter ordered two heretical Lutherans burned at the stake , Sir Devon applauded . We want no schismatics here , ' he told his son Latimer . He died three months after his king , thus escaping the chaos into which England fell when the boy , Edward VI , reigned briefly . Sir Latimer Steed , who inherited the title and the considerable estate which went with it , was even more devotedly attached to Catholicism and the Pope than his father had been , and he was appalled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convert England into a Protestant country . Sir Latimer fulminated against it , and he allowed to all who visited the former monastery that the honest men of England will never embrace the heresies of Geneva . ' He was much relieved when Edward , always sickly , as if God had cursed his father for having had six wives and beheading two of them , died .  | Now Mary , thirty-seven years old and tested in the furnace of Tudor wrangling , assassination and piety , approached the throne , determined to put everything right . It was a glorious day for good Catholics like Sir Latimer when she accepted the crown , and it was not long before the heretical leaders who had tried to lure England away from Rome paid the penalty for their treason . One after another went to the stake , and Sir Latimer , praying in the chapel which his father had stolen from the church , gave his benediction to the fires  --  It 's the only way to keep England pure . ' The first sign he received that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his son Fairleigh rushed in from London with shocking news : Hugh Latimer was burned at the stake . ' It was unbelievable . The Steeds had known the Latimers for more than a hundred years , and they had watched with shared pride as young Hugh progressed up the various rungs of the church . When Cardinal Wolsey missed being elected Pope , it had not been too much to hope that Latimer might succeed , and now he had perished at the stake . What dreadful miscalculation had caused such injustice ? It could not be said of young Fairleigh that he was a devout Catholic ; he was much more . He loved the church ; as a child playing in the vast rooms of the former monastery , now circumspectly called the grange , he gained a vision of what a sovereign church should be , and at Oxford he had led the young men who set bonfires at the accession of Queen Mary , for in her cleansing arrival he saw the salvation of the church . He understood that harsh steps must be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he applauded her force of character . She had to destroy him , Father , ' he explained . Hugh Latimer preached the most pernicious doctrine , and if he had gone unchecked , he would have seduced England into Protestantism . He was no better then Calvin . ' And so the son led the father through the troubled but glorious days of Queen Mary 's reign . When Mary took King Philip of Spain as her husband , young Fairleigh explained everything and quieted his father 's fears that this might mean a Spanish ascendancy . Not ever ! Spain and England will become united under the leadership of the Pope . There will be an end to fratricidal strife , and together Spain and England will put down the heresy in Germany and the Low Countries . ' They were heady days , these days of reconstruction , and Queen 's Wenlock was often filled with Oxford students arguing about the characteristics of the England that was to come . Certain fanatics had proposed that the stolen monasteries be returned to the church , but Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , would have none of that . Sir Latimer applauded her decision , as did the Oxford  | students , most of whom came from families that had profited from the expropriation . And then Mary died . The throne passed to her half sister , Elizabeth the Protestant , the bastard daughter of Anne Boleyn , that Whore of the Howards . Sir Latimer , reflecting on the disaster , told Fairleigh , That line is bad altogether . It was no accident that the two queens Henry had to behead were both Howards . Full cousins they were , and whores both of them . ' He paused to look at the ancient rafters of his knightly hall , and said , So now we have as queen the illegitimate daughter of a whore . Times will be bad , Fairleigh , and we shall all have to know where we stand . ' For good Catholics the times were worse than he had foreseen : the saintly Pope , Pius V , issued a bull which excommunicated Elizabeth as a heretic and advised the Catholics of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by condemning to death anyone who circulated the bull on English soil . The battle was joined ; step by step , harsh measures were promulgated against these devout people like young Fairleigh Steed who loved both the church of Rome and the land of England . Any Catholic caught attending a Mass : ? 70 fine , a horrendous sum in those days . Any Catholic who refused to attend Protestant church : ? zo fine each year levied against each member of the family , young or old . Any English man or woman who endeavored to convert good Protestants into Catholics : death by hanging . And any believers , such as the Steeds , who attempted to cling to the religion they had always followed : endless harassment , persecution and the risk of death if they harbored a secret priest . Queen Elizabeth could never comprehend the obstinate behavior of people like the Steeds . Her new religion preserved almost all the characteristics of the old : the Mass , transubstantiation , the high altar , baptism , rigorous attention to confession , nothing but fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in customary vestments . It was Elizabeth 's belief that a non-contentious person could worship according to the new ritual and never be aware that it was not Catholic . Furthermore , she outlawed with extreme severity any manifestations of Calvinistic Protestantism , and gleefully executed those Lutherans who sought to promulgate the pernicious teachings of Geneva . All that Elizabeth demanded of her subjects was that they forswear Rome and acknowledge her as governor of the church as it functioned in England . The harsh law of 1581 explained all in its title : To Retain the Queen Majesty 's Subjects in Due Obedience . Spiritual obedience to a human sovereign the Steeds refused to concede . They became surreptitious Catholics , secret adherents to the ancient faith , daring protectors of itinerant priests who labored in peril to keep that faith alive .  | Queen 's Wenlock , once one of the notable smaller monasteries of England , became in the 15705 a center of the Catholic missionary spirit . Old Sir Latimer said that he would be damned before he would permit a Whore of the Howards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to mind his tongue lest he be hanged , and reminded him that it was not one of the Whores of the Howards who was doing this to England but the illegitimate daughter of one of the whores . It was young Fairleigh , now twenty-five and down from Oxford , who felt the pressure of the age most keenly . He revered the old ways and believed that he could adhere to them without being treasonous to the new queen , even though he despised her . He was both a Catholic and an Englishman , and it ought to be possible to be a faithful , loyal citizen of both worlds . As to the preposterous charge of the Protestants that to be a Catholic meant automatically that one was eager to take up arms for the Pope and against England , he had never heard such nonsense . There were more than i6o,000 practicing Catholics in England and only a handful of traitors among them . But things kept happening that weakened his position . Fanatics with no knowledge of England were captured while trying to engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne he had once shared with Mary . Other fools , seeking to inspire an uprising in favor of that other Mary , the Catholic Queen of Scots , were caught with letters on their persons spelling out details . Crazed people , torn apart by religious conflicts they could not comprehend , tried to assassinate the queen , as madmen in all countries endeavor to kill their appointed leaders . All this led to suspicion and hatred ; good Englishmen who should have known better came to believe without question that the Pope intended to invade their land with Spanish help and reconvert them to old-style Catholicism . It was against this prejudice that the Steeds now had to operate . They bore unwavering testimony , all members of the family , that being a Catholic did not entail heresy . Even the slightest invitation that might look suspicious , they not only rejected but spoke against . The one forbidden thing they would not surrender was correspondence with the courageous priests . These priests , ordained of God , are our spiritual guides , ' Sir Latimer proclaimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most stalwart man ; in the ordinary course of events that had prevailed in England for centuries he would have been the village squire , dispensing a hit-or-miss kind of justice , refusing to sentence even the worst criminal to death , and husbanding his estates so that each generation should be a few acres better off than the preceding . It was by the accident of King Henry 's divorce that he had inherited a knighthood , and alt hough he was pleased with the buildings and estates which accompanied  | it , he was not really at ease in his minor castle . He would have been much more comfortable tending the hogs back in Devon . Certainly he was in no way prepared to enter religious debate . All he knew was that the Steeds had always obeyed the Pope and they intended to keep on doing so . It was understandable , therefore , that when devout English priests , ordained at the emigre English seminary at Douai across the Channel in the Spanish Netherlands , were filtered surreptitiously into England to protect the faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steeds at Queen 's Wenlock , and this they did . By Elizabethan definition such priests were treasonous  --  they sought not the salvation of souls but the fomenting of revolution  --  and anyone who harbored them did so at risk of life . The Steeds took that risk . It would be dusk when the wandering priests converged at some agreed-upon meeting spot in the countryside west of London . They would maintain a furtiveness lest the paid spies of Walsingham and Burleigh , who circulated about the countryside , detect them . As night fell they would move swiftly to the four vaulted doors of the old monastery and knock rapidly . A light would shine . One door would creak open a few inches . The priests would announce themselves , pronounce the password given them by Catholics in London , and enter swiftly as the door clanged shut . Inside , Sir Latimer would pour the drinks and ask what was happening at Douai . The translation of the Bible into English acceptable to Catholics was proceeding . New priests were being ordained regularly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most recent arrivals had already been hanged , but other would-be martyrs were on the way . And what of the new Pope ? The young priests said that he was about to take a step which would assist them mightily in their work . He would announce that the bull of his predecessor commanding all good Catholics to oppose Queen Elizabeth would be placed in some kind of suspension so that Catholics could obey the queen in all things temporal . Damned clever of the Pope ! ' Sir Latimer cried . That absolves us of heresy . ' It does indeed , ' the priests agreed . But courts subservient to the queen saw the papal move as subterfuge , and the hanging of priests continued . In the summer of 158o there came to the grange a fugitive priest so luminous that he seemed to carry with him visible proof of his sanctity and his coming martyrdom . He was Edmund Campion , forty years old that summer , one of the brightest students Oxford had ever known , a distinguished scholar at the Catholic seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Jesuits at Rome . He was a philos- opher , a historian , an author of pamphlets and a superb theologian . Among his friends , Protestants and Catholics alike , he was known as the marvel of his age , and fourteen years earlier Queen Elizabeth herself , enchanted by an oration he delivered before her when she visited Oxford , had said , For this young man , unlimited preferment waits . ' He had chosen instead the thorny road of missionary priest , and on the day when he slipped ashore at Dover he knew that his fame was such that he must be spotted by Walsingham 's spies and burned as a martyr . Secure in this knowledge and satisfied with his fate , he moved courageously through the countryside , holding prayer meetings and ignoring the likelihood that Protestant informers were tracking him . He arrived at Queen 's Wenlock one Friday and told Sir Latimer , of whom he had heard valorous reports , that he wished to conduct Mass for Catholics in the area , and these were hastily assembled , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of betrayal . When they streamed into the grange , this saving remnant of an older faith , they found awaiting them tough old Sir Latimer , bushy eyebrows in a furrow , and the serene face of Edmund Campion . He chose as his text a passage from St. Paul 's journeys and compared the work Paul had done with what the fugitive priests were doing . Pagan Rome sought Paul no less avidly than Protestant Walsingham seeks me . In the end , Paul triumphed , and so shall we . ' His preaching consisted of simple yet powerful examples of what the furtive graduates of Douai had accomplished in keeping alive in England the sacred flames of Catholicism . The glory of our Church is their martyrdom . The fires of their burned bodies inflame our holy spirit . ' He spoke like one possessed , but he did not rant , nor did he ever point to himself as an exemplar . He simply reported what Catholics were attaining in these decisive times . When he finished he performed the ceremony of the Mass , blessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this holy feast . As he placed on each tongue the body of Christ he said , Peace shall be with us . ' Perhaps it was the tragic events that happened later which led persons who attended this Mass to claim in years to come that it had been a holy moment , but all so testified : The future stood revealed , and about the blessed head of Edmund Campion we saw the halo of martyrdom . ' In any case , Father Campion left Queen 's Wenlock in a state of exaltation , as if his days of testing were already at hand . Sir Latimer and his son Fairleigh accompanied Campion to his next preaching , at a grange near Faringdon , in Bucks , and from there to Oxford itself , where young Steed introduced the daring priest to numerous undergraduates committed to Catholicism . With these young minds he discussed the future of the church in England and the nature of individual vocation . After his final Mass he intended heading for Nor- folk , where the heavy incidence of Catholics would render him relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to return to Faringdon to preach again to large numbers of the faithful who had not been privileged to hear him on his earlier visit to Queen 's Wenlock . Acceding to the supplications so urgently pressed upon him , he retraced his steps to Sir Latimer 's home , where Protestant spies awaited . It was they who had engineered the clamant invitation and it was they who conducted him a prisoner back to London and a cell in the Tower . He was lodged in Little Ease , the famous crib too low for standing , too cramped for sleeping , and there he was held in crouching solitary confinement without adequate food for four days . He was then racked three separate times until his joints spread apart , and in his extremity he confirmed what Burleigh and Walsingham already knew , that he had been protected by Sir Latimer Steed of the grange at Queen 's Wenlock . The old knight was promptly arrested and thrown like his priest into Little Ease , from which he emerged a shattered man , bumbling and speaking in fragmentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force increased , and no matter what the hideous jailers and the rack-masters did to him , he bore one simple testimony : that he was loyal to England and faithful to his Church . The interrogators screamed at him , charged him with ingratitude , reminded him that he was a creature of whatever king or queen possessed the throne at the moment , and thus obligated to swear fealty to whichever form of religion that monarch professed . Such an idea was repugnant , and he rejected it scornfully , so in late November 1581 he and Father Campion were dragged into Westminster Hall , in whose fine and lofty chambers the leaders of law and clergy met to pass judgment on treasonous heretics . Fairleigh Steed was allowed to attend the trial , along with many Protestants who cheered every point scored against the convicts . The trial was a sham . No witness could be found to prove that Father Campion had ever preached treason , whereas eleven came forward to testify that he had specifically told everyone at the grange that their civil duty was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Latimer , the whole testimony of his life was that of loyalty to the crown . Fairleigh , listening as closely as he could to all that was said , could not imagine any verdict but innocent , and he sat in numbed horror when the judges , responsible and decent men of the realm , read out their sentence : You must go to the place from whence you came , there to remain until you shall be drawn through the open City of London upon hurdles to the place of execution , and there be hanged . But you shall be let down while still alive , and your privy parts shall be cut off , and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight , and then your  | bodies shall be divided into four parts to be disposed of at Her Gracious Majesty 's pleasure . And God have mercy on your souls . ' Ten days later the sentence was carried out in meticulous detail , and Fairleigh Steed forced himself to watch as his father and this sainted priest were jerked about horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies were torn apart . Neither the old man nor the young uttered a cry , and Fairleigh was convinced that when their spirits departed they entered heaven to take their place in the bosom of Abraham . A week later Sir Fairleigh 's wife gave birth to a son , whom a new priest from Douai christened Edmund . Sir Latimer Steed 's head was stuck on a pike and exhibited for nine weeks at Tyburn , during which time his family at Queen 's Wenlock tried to formulate a plan for continued existence . Curiously , in view of the savage death meted out to the old knight , the family 's lands were not confiscated ; Sir Latimer 's descendants suffered no attainder , because the monarchs of England generally allowed the treason of a parent to end there , in hopes that the children might learn from their elders ' mistakes , and reform . The Steeds made two decisions : they would in all things be loyal to England , and they would continue to hear Mass . Young Edmund spent the first six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he thought of his father he visualized a quiet gentleman who tended the affairs of his huge holdings and then prayed resolutely with whatever priest happened to pass by , for he was determined to hold on to his Catholic heritage . Edmund patterned himself after his father , and throughout England in these quiet years from 1581 through 1587 this type of sensible truce prevailed . But in 1588 King Philip of Spain , seeking to regain the English throne he had once occupied as Mary 's husband , blasted all reasonable hopes held by families like the Steeds . He sent his conquering Armada up the Channel to invade England , destroy Protestantism and forcibly lead the captured land back to Rome . Stupid Englishmen , especially those who had lived abroad in exile , made stupid statements about the restoration of the Pope , and within the island other misguided idiots believed that as soon as Spanish troops set foot on English soil , Catholics of the realm would rise up to greet them and aid in the subjugation of their homeland . From that summer day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleons off Plymouth and sent them to their graves in storms off the Hebrides , the fate of ordinary Catholics like the Steeds was sealed . The general populace knew them to be treasonous , the whole  | lot of them , and it was further believed that only a miracle had enabled the English to defend themselves against papal invasion and the restoration of the burnings which Queen Mary had sponsored during her brief and bloody reign . The ostracism fell most heavily on young Edmund . At school he was a child who kept apart , and at Oxford one to be avoided . He could never hold public office ; nor serve as a justice of the peace , like his forebears ; nor testify in certain kinds of trials ; nor marry into the good families ; nor serve as an officer in either navy or army . He had to pay special taxes , and worst of all , was held in contempt by the countryside . The hearing of Mass became more difficult , for in the wake of the Armada fugitive priests were hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young Catholic could exist in England , but that was about all . But in 16oz , as Edmund reached his majority , Queen Elizabeth sickened , and in 1603 she died  --  bald , bewigged and uglier than sin . As prayers were being said for the salvation of her grand and murderous soul , Sir Fairleigh Steed assembled his family in the great hall at Queen 's Wenlock , where a fugitive priest read a Mass for the departed queen , asking the Steed family to forgive her for the wrongs she had done them . When all in the room had pledged allegiance to their new king , James VI of Scotland and I of England , a fervent prayer was uttered by Sir Fairleigh , asking that God make the new monarch more understanding than the old . Nothing changed . Catholics continued to be excluded from government , and one of Edmund 's professors told him , You should have been a don at Oxford , were you not a Catholic . ' It was in this confusion that Edmund came down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to embrace the new faith . ' Sir Fairleigh gasped , whereupon Edmund added , Publicly . If this nation continues to place infirmities upon Catholics , I deem it permissible for me to deceive the nation . When I return to Oxford , I shall take the Oath of Conformity . From that day forth I shall be a public Protestant . ' And inwardly ? ' As good a Catholic as ever . When you hold Mass , I shall attend . ' Edmund , you undertake a grievous task . ' I have no desire to have my guts torn out . ' No man does , but sometimes it happens . ' It wo n't happen to me . I 'll play their filthy game . ' Young men often think , ' Sir Fairleigh said , that they can play any game , if only they keep their hearts pure . ' I intend trying , ' Edmund said , and on the first anniversary of King James ' ascension he rode to Oxford and in public ceremony announced that he was forswearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to either Pope or priests . He allowed a chaplain  | to administer the Oath of Conformity , and from that moment became an ostensible Protestant , to the delight of friends who had always wished him well . In fact , his conversion gave so much pleasure that he was offered preferments as an inducement to other Catholics to follow suit , and his professors reopened discussion of a post at the university . In this manner Edmund Steed was lured back into the mainstream of English life . He worked for the government in London and was invited by his associates to their places in the country , where he met old gentlemen who in their youth had known Sir Devon , and one such man in Bucks told Edmund frankly that he hoped the time would come when Steed would join their family , seeing they had such a plethora of daughters . But whenever he returned to the handsome old grange at Queen 's Wenlock , and the doors were closed , and night fell , and the fugitive priests from Douai materialized , he resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue . It was during such a visit , when the Mass had been especially significant , that he took his father out into the timeless orchards which had been planted personally by Good Queen Anne in 1387 , and there under the gnarled trees told him , Father , the burden is too great . I ca n't dissemble . My soul is being torn apart . ' I supposed it would be , ' the wise old man said . What do you pro-pose ? ' A company 's being formed to establish a new settlement in America . I shall subscribe . ' I understand , ' Sir Fairleigh said . He did not press him on how he would survive in a distant land without the consoling reassurances of this grange and these memories , for he was certain that Edmund had weighed his losses . What was important was that his son get back on solid footing , the kind the Steeds had always preferred . I suppose you 'll quit the Protestant masquerade ? ' As soon as possible . ' Why not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company wo n't welcome Catholics . ' Do n't delay too long , Edmund . Dissembling corrodes . ' I intend placing myself in a position where it 's no longer necessary . ' The old knight did not want to see his youngest son quit England , and especially he did not want him to end his association with the grange , for the strength of the Steeds had always been their reliance on the land : the furrows and the hunting and the birth of lambs . He knew how desperately Edmund would long for these pastures and orchards when he pined in a savage land , but if leaving would help clarify his soul , he must leave .  | I wo n't see you again , Father . ' You sail so soon ? ' Within the month , they say . ' They neither embraced nor shook hands ; excessive display was not the way of the Steeds , but when he said farewell in the vaulted doorway built so many years ago , the old man shivered . These have not been good years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been seeing Sir Latimer 's head on that pike . That 's the end of all of us , I 'm afraid . ' They looked at each other and parted . Few of mankind 's memorable adventures started more poorly than the English settlement of Virginia . During the last days of December i6o6 the company to which Edmund Steed had subscribed piled 105 courageous emigrants onto the three small ships and set sail for the New World , expecting to make landfall within five weeks . Off the coast , but still in sight of England , they were becalmed for six agonizing weeks . The wind would not rise and there was nothing the infuriated captains could do ; ominously , the leaders of the expedition watched the would-be settlers consume much of the food intended to see them through the first months of the experiment . It was not until May 14 that the ships unloaded at a swampy island in the James River , grandiloquently named Jamestown , as if it were an operating city . Lack of food , miasmal land , confusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomers , so that when the dreadful summer ended , only thirty-eight of the original group still lived . That these could survive the winter seemed doubtful . The behavior of the Indians who populated the western shore of the Chesapeake bewildered the settlers : for six weeks the redskins would be amiable , bringing to the stockade food which saved the lives of the remnant ; for the next six weeks they would kill any settler who stepped outside . It was difficult for the Englishmen to accept such irrational behavior , and most came to fear and hate the Indian . Edmund Steed did neither . His contact with red men led him to believe that they were much like other humans , capable of trust and desirable as neighbors . He felt at ease traveling amongst them , so that when Captain Smith launched his serious exploration of the Chesapeake , seeking the gold and silver known to exist there , it was natural for Steed to participate , and his contacts with the peaceful Indians of the eastern shore confirmed his attitudes . But in November i6o8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had horrifying results . It was an exploration to ascertain what kind of land lay beyond the confluence of the Chickahominy , and after the little band left their canoes , Steed marched at the  | rear with the carpenter George Landon , and his easy experiences with the Choptanks lulled him into carelessness . Farther and farther the two stragglers fell behind , and when they were totally detached , a band of howling savages overwhelmed them . A hideous orgy followed , with warriors jabbing pointed sticks at their faces , stopping just short of the eyes . Then , as Steed would later report : The women of the tribe descended upon us , pushed the braves their brothers away , and lashed us to stakes set into the ground . With much dancing and glee they attended to Landon first , using sharp oyster shells to cut off all his fingers , one knuckle at a time . While he was screaming so loud that he drowned out the exulting cries of the women , they knelt down and sawed away his toes in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp , and moving slowly downward , ripped off his living skin . While he was still alive they piled brush about his stake and set it afire . When their dancing ended they came at me with their shells , but Captain Smith and his men had doubled back to find us and came upon the scene in time to save me . Later , a group of heavily laden supply ships arrived from London under the leadership of Captain John Ratcliffe , who had served as captain aboard the tiny pinnace Discovery during the original voyage of 1607 and who had later held the presidency of the council . Since he was well informed on affairs in Virginia , he was sent with a body of soldiers to negotiate with Chief Powhatan for more land , but that insidious Indian lured the Englishmen with promises , set upon them nefariously and slew most . They kept Ratcliffe , Steed and one other alive for special tortures , and once again the Oxford student was rescued to report the horrible incident : With our dead lying about us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were set , and when we were toasted near to death women attacked poor Ratcliffe and with shells scraped away all the flesh on his left arm up to the shoulder , tossing the bits into the fire . They did the same with his right arm and then his right leg , whereupon he died . When such evidence was endlessly repeated , Edmund Steed lost all trust in Indians . He came to see them as crafty , cruel , lazy and uncivilized , and it was a prudent white man who anticipated their perfidy . Now when trading parties ascended the James to deal with Powhatan , Steed remained apart , between two soldiers , ready to discharge his musket straight at the heart of any savage who threatened a treacherous move .  | As his faith in Indians diminished , his trust in Captain Smith grew . He saw him as the only savior of the colony , a man of petty foibles and ramrod rectitude . When the little captain announced that he must quit the colony to ensure a more faithful chain of supplies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers but would return , Steed foresaw that once safe in England he would become caught up in a hundred fascinating schemes involving dukes and foreign princes and wars in Muscovy . I shall not see you again , Captain , ' Steed said mournfully as Smith stood on the dock , surrounded by packets of arrows he was taking back to England for display . You 'll survive . Remember , you 're one of the men of iron . ' I meant . . . you 'll not return . ' Me ! This bay is blood to me . It courses through my veins . ' He said much more , and in the end drew himself to maximum height , saluted the little colony he had kept alive , and was seen no more in Virginia . On the day he sailed down the river , the testing time began , those starving weeks and months of autumn 1609 and winter 161o . When Smith left , the expanding colony contained 507 members ; six terrible months later only 61 remained . Of this foodless , heatless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might lead are dead . The doctor and the carpenters and all who worked to keep the town functioning , they are dead . Even as I write the room is cluttered with bodies , for we no longer have any to bury them . We have neither a bean nor a biscuit , and I shudder to inform you that some , beyond the point of desperation , have taken to digging up the bodies of those already dead and endeavouring to eat them , and from doing this , some have gone mad and cast themselves into the river and died . And if we who are able to move seek to leave the fort to find food , the lurking Indians slay us . It was a time of such gnawing horror that those few who survived sought ever after to erase it from their memory , and yet it was the foundation of fact on which the great colony of Virginia was erected . On May 23 , 161o , when the spring breezes made starvation even more monstrous , a man who had crawled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Steed went to him he saw that the man was pointing downstream where two rescue ships hove into view , and when they moved to shore Steed saw that their names were Patience and Deliverance . It was during the following spring , in 1611 , when the colony was stabilized , that Steed decided to quit Jamestown and start a new life on that  | hospitable island he had scouted with Captain Smith three summers earlier . During all the trials which beset him in Virginia , he had kept alive his vision of that island with the tall trees and abundant fish , and even when it seemed that the Indian women must hack him to pieces , or that starvation would evaporate him before the day ended , he could visualize that island and imagine himself living quietly there . He could even recall the Indians he and Captain Smith had met along the river , especially the giant chief , and he wanted desperately to believe that they were different from the mercurial and untrustworthy tribes under Powhatan . He had no evidence to support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was not unreasonable to hope that they were different . The driving force which impelled him to leave Jamestown was one which his ancestors would have understood : Sir Devon with his simplistic sense of right and wrong ; bumbling , stumbling Sir Latimer willing to be torn apart for his faith ; hesitant Sir Fairleigh trying to be both a good Catholic and a loyal Englishman  --  they would have comprehended when he said , I am strangled with duplicity . I must live where I can stand forth as an honest Catholic . ' Jamestown was far too preoccupied with mere survival to worry much about the forms of religion ; it was not flamboyantly anti-Catholic , but that was because the leaders of the settlement could not imagine that any of their flock were Catholic . With them it was always Good Queen Bess for whom Virginia was named ' and Faithful King James , a reliable man even though his mother was that Catholic whore , Mary of Scotland . ' It was known , of course , that Steed 's grandfather , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherence to Rome , but it was also known that young Steed had abjured that poisonous faith ; besides , on various occasions he had proved his valor , and that counted . Edmund Steed could have continued his masquerade as a false Protestant , and his offspring , when he had them , could certainly have been counted among the first families of Virginia , but the tricky doubleness of his position  --  Protestant by day , Catholic by night  --  wasmore than he could sustain . He was indeed sick of dissembling and determined to put an end to it . For a Catholic , there was no future in the Virginia settlement , so he would go elsewhere . He was not forthright in offering his reasons for moving to the eastern shore . I want to go where the oystering is better , ' he said lamely . Trade with the Indians who live across the bay could be profitable to Virginia . ' One after another he paraded his spurious reasons , and in the end the governors of the colony granted him permission  --  It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located on the eastern shore . ' So in May i6ii he rose each day before dawn to hack out the planks required for the boat he had in mind . Samuel Dwight , a ship 's carpen- ter on one of the rescue ships , gave Steed some rule-of-thumb advice . For these shallow waters make her flat-bottomed . Also , it 's easier for them as does n't know to build a keel . One mast is all a man alone can handle , and it a short one . Pointed bow for probing , transom stern for stability . And leeboards to hold her into the wind . ' What are leeboards ? ' Steed inquired . When you 've finished putting her together , I 'll instruct you . ' It took Steed four weeks , with spasmodic help from Mr. Dwight , to build his small craft . It was only fifteen feet long , but it was sturdy , and if the uneven finishing of the planks allowed water to flow in at a rate that would soon sink her , stout caulking would cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , and when it swayed on the placid waters of the James , Steed asked his carpenter , What type of boat is it ? ' and the newcomer replied , Bateau , ' and he demonstrated how the leeboards must be attached . They were two stout oval slabs of wood , fastened outboard at amidships by pivots , one to the starboard , the other to port . By convenient ropes they could be lowered into the water or lifted out , and their purpose was to counteract the normal sideways drift of a boat under sail . They were , in short , a clever , practical substitute for a fixed keel , and they worked . Like two misplaced fins of a fish , they dominated the appearance of the bateau , but Carpenter Dwight said of them approvingly , You 'll find them valuable in the bay . Remember , when the wind is pushing you sideways on the starboard tack , put down your port leeboard . And when it pushes you from port , put down your starboard . ' Steed said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into it he piled the goods he had collected from those unfortunates who had died during the starving time , with special attention to axes , knives , gunpowder and nails . He left Jamestown with one barrel of dried foods , an extra pair of heavy trousers and three woolen shirts . He had no medicine , no small tools , no needles for sewing , and only two knives , three forks , four spoons and a pair of guns . Yet he had not the slightest doubt that he could occupy his island , and tame it , and make it an industrious part of the empire . On June 12 , 16n , he set forth , and because there was no wind , he rowed all that day down the James . His fancy leeboards were of no use , but his hands were well blistered . However , on June 13 a tidy breeze came down the James and into it he hoisted his sail . Since the wind came from directly behind , he still had no use for his leeboards , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brisk wind swept down from the northwest , and he put his bateau on a port tack so that it would head up the bay , against the wind , and now he dropped his starboard leeboard and felt it catch the water and brace him against sideward drifting . Carpenter Dwight knew what he was doing ! ' he exulted as the wind  | drove him forward , and all that day he lay at ease admiring the bateau he had built . Now the waters of the bay became familiar and he was able to tick off ' the rivers of the western shore  --  York , Rappahannock , Potomac  --  and when he reached the Patuxent he knew it was time to start swinging eastward to strike the entrance to the Choptank and the island he sought . It was the longest day of the year when he approached the western end of the island , and he decided not to go ashore that night , because he could not foretell what mood the once-peaceful Choptank Indians might be in . Of one thing he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . This would be his empire ; here he would live according to the principles of his fathers . When long-delayed night closed in , and the outlines of the island became increasingly dim , so that in the end it existed only in his mind , he uttered a prayer : Divine Leader Who has brought me here , permit me safe conduct onto my island and allow me to live here in Thy ways . ' He could not sleep . All night he sat in his bateau staring in the direction of land , and toward four , when dawn began to brighten and his island rose from the mists like a sanctuary preserved , he shouted joyously and steered his boat around the north shore and into that safe creek he had noted three years before . As he sailed its deep clear waters and saw the massive trees lining the banks like courtiers arranged to welcome a returning king , he nodded gravely and announced , This is the island of Devon , proprietary of the Steeds , and so it shall remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek and waded ashore . After scouting the area for likely spots , he found a rise containing only a few trees , with open space enough to build a hut from which he would be able to watch the river and his boat . With the good luck that comes to countrymen who have a feeling for land , he had stumbled upon the choicest spot for building , and as the days progressed and he cleared the brush , he was satisfied that he had chosen well . He worked from dawn till dusk , day after day , catching fish and crabs for his food and spotting the berry patches and nut trees for future use . Deer came to watch . Raccoons were plentiful and three blue herons patrolled his shore , catching so many fish that he felt certain he could do the same . With all this food , he reflected , why did we starve in Jamestown ? But as soon as he posed the question he knew the answer : Because the Virginia Indians were hostile and would not allow us to hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bullets would defend him if the Choptank Indians turned hostile . With so much work to do , he could not brood upon this possibility , but he did refrain from wasting ammunition . With his ax he went to the woods and began chopping down the small trees he would need for his  | hut , and when the outline was formed , he cut branches and wove them between the poles , as he had seen Indians do , but the result was rough and rain entered almost unimpeded . But then he brought rushes from the river and tangled them among the branches , and when he compacted them , like a woman tightening threads upon a loom , he had a satisfactory wall . He was then free to explore his island , and found it a fascinating place . Utilizing various tricks of measurement , he calculated that it ran about two and a quarter miles east and west , one and a half north and south , for a total of something more than two thousand acres . It was cut nearly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the south , and the two halves were sufficiently different to accommodate two varied styles of husbandry : sheep to the west , corn to the east . He had no premonition of what the real treasure of this land was going to be . He had occupied his island for more than four weeks without seeing any Indians , or signs of any . No canoes had appeared on the river , nor had any fires been set . He tried to recall how far to the east he and Captain Smith had gone before they encountered the village of Patamoke , but his memory was vague . Where can the Indians be ? he thought one morning as he surveyed the empty river ; he could not know they had moved eastward to escape mosquitoes . And then toward the end of September , while he felled trees on the eastern point of the island , he saw three canoes edging gingerly out from the white cliffs opposite . They were not war canoes , so they could not have come seeking war ; they seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot about a half mile from the island they stopped . There they stayed all day , making no further gesture , even though they must have seen Steed . Finally they retired . They repeated this for two days , and on the third Steed made signals and lured them closer , and when they were less than a hundred yards from shore , so that their faces were becoming distinct , a short thin man shouted in a language Steed could not understand . The canoes milled about , guided by what must have been conflicting suggestions , and on the spur of the moment Steed dropped his ax , walked to the edge of the water and held up his hands , empty . The canoes moved closer , until the faces became so individualized that he could see one of the men had a cleft chin . No one spoke . Steed continued to hold his hands open and pointed to the emptiness behind him , indicating that he was alone . The Indians stared at him stolidly , remained in position for perhaps half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the fourth day this procedure was repeated , and Steed suspected that the man with the cleft chin wanted to come ashore but was restrained by the men in his canoe .  | On the fifth day Steed kept about his work , watching the canoes out of the corner of his eye , but again no moves were taken by the Indians , and well before dusk they retired . He judged that on the morrow something definite would happen , and he prepared his axes and his guns . That evening , as the sun left the sky and a darkness deeper than usual enveloped the island , he recalled the scenes of torture he had witnessed , and the destructive fighting on the western shore , and he prayed : God , let my Indians come in peace . ' He could not sleep . His hut seemed unbearably close and he left it to sit on a log , staring into the darkness and wondering what he might be forced to do in the coming day , and when the pale streaks of early dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hut , like a proper chief , and wait for the Indians to come to him . Day brightened and nothing happened . Forenoon brought buzzing insects and an inquisitive deer , but no visitors . High noon arrived , bringing with it a stillness that quieted even the rustling of the tallest trees , and then when the sun had begun its descent he saw four canoes come into his river , and in the lead position in the lead canoe sat the immensely tall Indian with the three turkey feathers , whom he and Captain Smith had met . As the canoes approached his undefended bateau his heart beat with hammers ; if the Indians wished , they could sink the boat and leave him powerless . They passed it by and came to the rock landing he had fashioned . The man with the cleft chin jumped out first , and led the way for the chief , who seemed even larger as he came on this crucial visit . When the giant was about to reach the hut , Steed rose , extended both hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian studied them , extended his own , and looked for a place to sit . Steed beckoned him inside , and for more than an hour they talked . Neither knew a word of the other 's speech , but they spoke of deer , which were plentiful , and of oysters , which were good when dried , and of the woven wall Steed had built . The Indian considered it commendable and showed his followers that he could not penetrate its close weaving with his finger . They were unusually interested in his tools , and he showed them the axes with their sharp edges . He took down one of his guns and laboriously explained its loading and preparation . Having done this , he led the tall Indian outside and waited till some doves flew by ; taking extra precautions and holding his breath so as to steady the gun , he fired . A dove fell not far from the chief , who sent the man with the cleft chin to fetch it . How did such a thing happen ? ' he asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun was , it was the bateau that tantalized the giant chief and he asked if he might inspect it . The visit had proceeded so amicably that Steed was ready to believe that these Indians were exactly as they had been before : they were not infected by the wars of the Potomacs . So he took the tall chief to where the bateau was moored , and four of the Indians climbed aboard . They wanted to know  | how the sail , which lay in the bottom of the boat , operated , and what the oval leeboards were ; they were perplexed by the length of the oars , but always they came back to the sail . Then began a mysterious operation , repeated many times : the chief touched the sail , then touched Steed 's face , and the Englishman could make nothing of the gestures . But finally it dawned upon him that what the Indian was comparing was the whiteness of the sail and the face . Yes , ' Steed said . A sail is always white . ' And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift the anchor , and when a breeze came the boat and its five passengers moved down the creek . Seeing their chieftain being spirited away alarmed the Indians on shore and they launched a great clatter , which the chief silenced with a gesture . He then studied the sail 's whiteness , and Steed saw that he was weeping from some deep and powerful remembrance . When Steed was satisfied that friendly relations were possible , he indicated that he wanted to pay the tribe for the land he was occupying , so a formal procession was arranged  --  the bateau carrying Steed and the tall chieftain , followed by the four canoes  --  and it went upriver to the village of Patamoke , where the young werowance was informed of all that had occurred on the island . A deed was drawn up , dated to October c6ii , and signed by Steed , who showed the werowance how to make his mark . The tall chief did likewise , as did the little fellow with the cleft chin . When this was completed he handed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could spare and seven nails . He had traded a fair portion of his worldly wealth for an island the Indians not only did not need , but had never used . And when the paper was folded , and the long clay pipes were smoked , he did more . By sign language he promised them that when trade was established he would give them additional gifts , and he insisted upon this because the pact had brought him slightly more than four thousand acres , half on the island , half on the facing shore , and some of it the choicest land along the river . By this treaty , his immediate problems of existence were also relieved , for he received an unlimited supply of vegetables , and he could sleep at night untroubled . But what galvanized his imagination was something he saw as he was about to leave : in the corner of the long house lay a bundle of beaver pelts , and when he asked where they had come from , the werowance pointed generally to the south , indicating that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of beaver . Then Steed knew what he must do : he must convince the Indians to bring him many pelts against future trading privileges ; he would deliver the furs to Jamestown , where ships from England would barter for them .  | The result would be a constant flow of axes , cloth , guns and nails , with a generous profit to him on all transactions . His ancestors in England , dating back to the thirteenth century , would have been mortified to think that Steed was about to engage in trade  --  that was forbidden a gentleman ? but Edmund rationalized that none of them had tried to settle virgin acreage . He would make himself the best trader in the colony . But like Captain Smith on the banks of the York , he failed to spot the commodity which would form the true basis of his wealth . As he stowed the beaver pelts in his bateau he did not notice that in an opposite corner of the long house the werowance had another treasure , a pile of the best tobacco leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not learn rapidly ; they were amazingly delinquent in acquiring the skills that mattered , like fertilizing corn with dead fish or living off oysters when meat was unavailable , but when they did finally learn something , they clung to it desperately and made it better : Edmund Steed had learned how to accumulate beaver pelts . But there was one question the Choptanks did not answer for him , the one that would perplex every European settlement in the New World : where would the men who fought the wilderness find women ? Each nation solved this vital problem according to its traditions . In Canada the French forerunners were already taking Indian brides . In Mexico to the south , where a flourishing civilization had developed , Spaniards had adopted two solutions : some married Aztecs , some sent home for childhood acquaintances . In Brazil the Portuguese , finding jungle Indians incompatible , chose black women who had been imported as slaves from Africa . And in Virginia the stiff-lipped Englishmen did nothing until such time as shiploads of properly assembled London women could be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for payment of their passage money , plus an undisclosed profit . Edmund Steed , now thirty-two , would never have thought of taking into his hut an Indian girl . An English gentleman married an English gentlewoman , preferably of one 's own county and religion , and if none came along , the gentleman might wait till he was thirty-five or even forty . Steed thought that when he delivered his beaver pelts to Jamestown it would be about time to consider buying a bride , but until then he was content to live alone . Not really content , not really alone . The tall chief , having observed his loneliness , waited for a day when he and Steed bargained in broken words for a pile of pelts , and when a trade was concluded and the lesser Indians had left , he uttered a low call . From behind reeds at the end of the wigwam a seventeen-year-old girl appeared , wearing soft brown deerskin and cockleshells in her hair . Steed recognized her as the child he had seen on that first trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tciblento , although at their first meeting he had misspelled it .  | She is to accompany you to the island , ' the white-haired chief said . She has been saved for this moment . ' The beautiful girl kept her gaze downcast and would not look at her father 's guest , but her eagerness to visit the island was apparent . Steed blushed and rejected the offer with prolonged attention to protocol : he was honored ; she was lovely ; the chief 's friendship meant everything . And something in the way he spoke conveyed to the waiting girl the fact that he was rejecting her , and her slim shoulders drooped like the petals of a flower left in the sun . Her father would not accept this decision ; in agitated words he explained that his two sons were married to Choptank maidens , but that he had always hoped Tciblento might mate with a Susquehannock worthy of her . But this had not happened . He ended with his eyes close to Steed 's , pleading with him to accept this child , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by words , that never could he marry an Indian , the old man said , I bided my time and trusted that when the Great Canoe came .. What is the Great Canoe ? ' Steed asked . It came a long time ago , and we knew it would return . We waited . ' He formed a sail with his fingers . You mean our ship ? ' Yes , we knew you were coming . ' He would say no more , but he did persist in the matter of his daughter . She is a good girl . She cooks , traps beaver , knows where the oysters and crabs are . ' Steed was embarrassed . For a chief to be peddling his daughter was undignified , and for an Englishman to accept would be repugnant . Firmly he said , No . She can not come . ' The girl did not weep or run away ; she stared at Steed with her great dark eyes as if to say , Sir , what an error you make . ' Pentaquod , his self-respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the Englishman the character of a Susquehannock warrior . Summoning the man with the cleft chin , he ordered him to designate two Choptank men to accompany Steed back to the island and there to make their homes , helping him in all things . Each of the men brought a woman and built a wigwam , so that Devon was properly settled . But this was no solution for Steed  --  he still lacked a wife , and when the time approached in 1614 for him to load his bateau with beaver pelts and return to Jamestown , he felt a growing sense of excitement . He thought : One of the ships coming to trade would surely bring a cargo of women . Perhaps he would find one whose passage money he could pay . But a moment 's reflection warned him that if any women had arrived , they would have been picked off by the local settlers ; his chances of finding a wife would not be good . He therefore drafted a letter to his father , not even knowing if Sir Fairleigh was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resplendent island , rich in all things , and I am on my way to building an estate of which you would be proud . But I am surrounded only by savages and I most urgently need a wife . Will you enquire of your friends in Berks whether there be a woman of Catholic upbringing and good family who knows her letters who would consent to join me in this enterprise ? And if so , please arrange her passage to Jamestown , where I will reimburse the captain of the ship she takes . Edmund Folding the letter neatly , he tucked it among the beaver pelts , cast off the bateau , and with his two Indian braves as crew set out for Jamestown . It was a long and peaceful sail , during which he was able for the first time to savor the Chesapeake and see it for the glorious body of water it was , without the pressure of exploration or flight . He lay back with the tiller tucked under one knee , his only obligation being to advise the Indians when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boom swung , and the sail filled from the opposite quarter , and the leeboards were shifted . It was a game which never palled , this trick of sailing into the wind , making it do what you commanded . Sometimes they asked Steed to allow them to supervise the maneuver , and one of them would take the tiller , and watch the wind and the sail , and cry in a loud voice , Prepare to come about ! Hard alee ! ' and the other would swing the boom and work the lines . Then both would smile . So long as the course remained down the Chesapeake , Steed felt no unusual emotion , but once the boat breasted the headland of the James and started tacking upriver , he became tense , for here some of the great days of his life had been spent : his defense of Captain Smith when the mob had wanted to hang him ; his escape from the murderous Indians who had flayed his partner ; his magical survival of the starving time , when eighteen of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sense of having helped launch a little colony in a new land . It was n't so small a colony now ; large ships were arriving from England with all the trading goods the early colonists had longed for , and where once there had been only men protecting themselves within a stockade , there were now women joining them to build families which occupied separate homes . As his bateau pulled up to the wharf , now a sturdy affair projecting well into the river , Steed was captivated by the sight of the women ; he had seen no Englishwomen for many years and had almost forgotten the grace with which they moved , the fall of their heavy skirts and the way they tied bits of cloth about their throats . They were like magic to him ,  | a reminder of all he had surrendered in fleeing to his island , and he was filled with that hungriness which would determine all he would do on this trip . There was a ship in the river , the Victorious out of Bristol , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundles of beaver pelts . ' I ' 11 take all of them you bring , Steed , ' he growled . And what 's that aft , sassafras root ? I 'll take all of it , too . ' It was much prized for distillations and the making of infusions to lower fevers . But Hackett 's chief delight were the two small tubs in which Steed had stored his salted sturgeon eggs . Caviar ! ' the captain shouted . I 'd take twenty tubs . Fish eggs is in great demand in London . They turn rancid quick but they 're worth the risk . ' In return for this strange collection of goods , Captain Hackett offered Steed a choice of axes , saws , nails , dried beans , salted pork , a compass , folds of writing paper , ink and a dozen books bound in leather . He chose only after the most careful calculations , as he had done when a boy being offered lollies at the grange , and when he was through , the captain said , You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What extra had you then ? ' Brides . ' Women ? English women ? ' And a few Dutch . With your credit you could have bought yourself a beauty . ' Will you be bringing more ? ' That I will . ' Will you deliver my letter , then , to my father ? ' He rummaged among the beaver pelts and produced the carefully composed message , and when he handed it to the captain he explained , I 'm asking my father to pick me out a bride and send her here in your ship . ' You pay her passage , I 'll deliver her to the gates of hell . ' ' I ' 11 pay in stacks of pelts , ' Steed said in quivering excitement . When will you return ? ' November , likely , if we get passable winds . ' I hope you do , ' Steed said fervently . I do hope the winds are good . ' When trading was completed , and the bateau loaded , he invited his two Indian helpers to climb aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In slow , grave movements the two little Choptanks went from item to item of the ship 's goods , never touching , never speaking , but when they came to the remnants of brightly colored cloth , their greed became uncontrollable , and each man grabbed an armful . Halloo ! ' a sailor protested . You ca n't just walk off with that there . ' In sign language he explained that they must bring him something in trade , and in signs they indicated they had nothing . Then get some- thing , ' he said , and they rushed to the railing and looked down at Steed , crying in Choptank , Master , we must have the cloth ! ' When he asked why , they said , As presents for our wives , ' and without reflection he tossed them one of his axes , and they carried it to the sailors , who gave them the cloth they desired . And as they climbed down into the bateau , happy and chattering , with gifts in their arms , Steed realized that among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one intended for a woman , and he was desolate . To the surprise of the Indians he did not weigh anchor . Reluctant to depart , he went ashore , to sup at the home of a man he had befriended during the starving time ; this man had purchased a wife three years before from one of the earlier shiploads , and now had two children and a third on the way . Steed could not keep from staring , for he thought this woman the most wonderful he had ever seen . She moved and smiled with such grace . Back in England she would not have been considered even pretty ; his mother had been a true beauty and he knew the difference , but this woman had a primitive grandeur which no mere prettiness could equal . She was , he thought , much like a statue he had seen at Oxford , solid and clean and perfectly fitted to its surroundings , and although the topic had not been introduced , he blurted out , Have any of the women who came in the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , ' she said evenly , we were all married within two days , and we are married still . ' No more was said , and soon a stern-faced bailiff came to the house to advise Steed that sailors on the English ship had given one of his Indians whiskey and the fellow had become obstreperous . Steed hurried away to find the Indian , red-faced , sweating and out of control . He had insisted upon leaping into the river to touch the sides of the ship , and twice he had been hauled out practically dead , but was determined to try again . Asquas ! ' Steed shouted . Lie down ! ' The little swimmer looked at Steed with unsteady eyes , recognized him as in command , and collapsed in the bottom of the bateau , where he lay motionless through the long night . Steed , aware that he should quit Jamestown the next day , remained aboard but could not sleep . He stood most of the night at the sheer strakes , staring at the rude collection of huts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it again and again . Oh God ! ' he cried suddenly . I wish it was November . ' In the morning he reported to the governors of Jamestown , advising them that he was returning to his island . He gave them a full account of the Indian tribes in that region , and of the trading goods that he would be delivering on future trips . They inquired of him the difference between the western shore of the Chesapeake and the eastern , and he replied , In all respects the western is more vigorous . Your Indians are warlike and  | your land excitable , your rivers are significant and your trees taller . One day Jamestown will be a new Jerusalem , and Virginia a nation of its own . On the eastern shore things are more subdued . There is neither war nor excitement and we will never have a Jerusalem there , nor a London neither . Our Indians are small and avoid war . We have no great riches , and our mosquitoes are twice the size of yours and three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On your western shore drums beat , but on the eastern shore we hear only the echoes . ' About this time the custom arose of referring to the Eastern Shore with capital letters , as if it were a special place ; this tribute was never paid the western shore . As he left the building in which the magistrates had interrogated him , he heard a commotion at the far end of the village and suspected that his Choptanks might be drunk again , but the noise came from a striking , well-developed blond young woman who was engaging in a public brawl with her husband , much older than she . He was endeavoring to quieten her , but she kept shouting , ' I ' 11 not stay ! ' And she pushed him away . In her determination to escape whatever threat he posed , she ran down the dusty path that served as the village street , flouncing her petticoats and generating a tumult . When she neared the council building at whose door Steed was standing , she turned back to address the populace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by murderous Indians . I 'll none of it . ' In lusty cries she appealed to the crowd for support , but a woman in a red kerchief , herself lately arrived from England , shouted back like a fishwife , Go back , you slut . Be a decent wife . ' ' I ' 11 not go back , ' she screamed , pushing her husband away . He lied to me . No farm . No boat of his own . Nothing but Indians . ' The woman with the kerchief cried , It 's no heaven for none of us . But it 's better than what you knew . ' It 's not ! ' the angry wife screamed . In London , I lived in a proper house , not a grassy hut . ' You lived in jail , ' the other replied , and a fight might have ensued except that the runaway noticed Steed in the doorway , watching her with curious intensity . Since he appeared to be headed for the bateau riding at the dock , she seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' she asked boldly . I am . ' And that 's your boat , is n't it ? ' It is . ' Oh , take me with you , ' she begged . Take me ! ' and she clung to him with such a show of anguish that he could not shake her loose , even though her husband was coming forward to claim her . Come home , Meg , ' her husband pleaded . He made a pathetic figure , a short , squarish countryman who must have worked hard in some rural English county and harder here in Virginia . He wore thick , patched  | homespun trousers , a rough wool shirt and shoes that some inept cobbler had hacked from a stretch of cowhide . He was in his thirties , the type of rural worker Steed had long known and liked . ' I 'm Simon Janney , ' he said . ' She 's mine and you must give her back . ' ' Of course I must , ' Steed said . ' By no device is she mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! ' the woman shouted , moving in front of Steed to confront the man Edmund had assumed to be her husband . ' We 're not married yet , nor ever shall be . ' ' She 's not your wife ? ' Steed asked , poking his head around from behind her bobbing curls . ' I paid for her passage , ' Janney said . ' And he took me to his pigsty . He can have his money back . ' ' How ? ' the woman in the red kerchief demanded . In desperation the fugitive left Steed , threw her arms wide in a beseeching gesture and asked the crowd , ' Will no one pay my passage ? ' A shocked silence greeted this extraordinary proposal , then Steed said , ' I will . ' He was standing close to Simon Janney when he said this and he heard the countryman gasp . ' You must n't , Mr. Steed . She 's to be my wife . ' He spoke stolidly , as if trying to protect a valuable ewe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' the other woman bellowed , ' do n't meddle with that one . Maria from the ship can tell you about her . ' The blonde whipped about to confront her accuser , and the swift movement of her ample body conveyed an excitement Steed had not experienced before ; she was like some powerful goddess turning to protect herself . ' Bring Maria here , ' she said with menacing softness , ' and I 'll attend her . ' She reached for Steed 's hand , drawing him close to her , and he , feeling for the first time the sexually powerful body of a woman pressing against his , clasped her hand . And by that action he committed himself . ' Friend Janney , ' he said persuasively , ' let her go . She 'll never be yours . ' ' She must , ' the stubborn little farmer said . His square red face , unshaved for three days , betrayed the torment he was feeling , and Steed felt sorry for him . But then Janney mumbled like a peasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay you , and more . I need a wife on my island . ' This simple statement of need echoed through the crowd , and all who had waited for the bride ships understood , but his confession had its greatest effect on the woman . Dropping his hand , she gently slipped her arm about his waist , and he felt dizzy and stammered , ' We 'll be married this day . ' ' Oh no ! ' she cried , withdrawing her arm . ' I 'm to see the island first . No more pigsties for me . ' ' Do n't meddle with her , Steed ! ' warned the other woman again .  | I ca n't pay you now , ' Steed explained to Janney , but when I next bring my goods , you shall be paid first . ' He paid seven pounds , ' the blonde said . Then I shall give him eight . ' But she 's to be my wife , ' Janney repeated . He was like a stunted oak damaged by careless plows but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Steed said , and he led Meg Shipton to his bateau . The couple arrived at Devon in June 1614 , he thirty-two years old , she twenty-five . At the moment of disembarking he had never yet kissed any woman but his mother ; he had been too busy defining his relationship to God in England and to Indians in Virginia ; but she had been at the job of kissing men for some fourteen years , and during this crossing of the bay she had developed a deep curiosity as to what it might be like when she finally plopped Mister Steed into bed . She was delayed , however , when he required her to survey the land to which he was bringing her : the flourishing fields , the trees , the birds . Are there Indians ? ' she asked apprehensively , and he pointed to the two who were tying the bateau to shore . And their wives will be here to help you , ' he assured her , pointing to the smaller wigwams near his own . They 're gentle folk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravado and clutched her hands . My home 's a pigsty too . I need you , Meg . ' She squeezed his fingers . He was so courteous that she could believe what the others had said in Jamestown : that he was from Oxford , dismissed by his noble family because of some petty quarrel . He had been very brave during the starving time , they told her , and had twice escaped murder by the Indians . But there was some mystery about him , else why would he seek an island ? Looking at his eagerness to please and sensing his gentleness , she almost fell in love with him , but instinct warned her against such folly . First she must inspect this island , and determine what he intended doing with it , and whether he had the funds to open new fields and build a real house . She acknowledged an obligation to repay him for her passage money , but she would do this in her own practiced way . Indeed , she was eager to begin . But when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , she was prevented from entering by the arrival of the two Indian wives bringing baskets of vegetables and wriggling crabs . They proposed instructing her in how to cook Indian dishes , an art in which she had no interest whatever , and after several hours were wasted in domestic trivialities she snapped , Let 's clear them out and jump into bed . ' The words intimidated Steed , for he had been conjuring up a much  | different approach to their first bedding , one which contained copious samples of the poetry he had acquired at Oxford , but since most of it was in Latin , it could hardly have been of much practical use . The Indians were dismissed and now the potential husband and wife were alone . It 's a fearful place , this , ' she said , poking her finger at the grassy wall , but it 's no pigsty . ' Deftly she slipped out of her clothes , and then , seeing that he had made no move to do likewise , said chidingly , Come , get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw bedding ; from long practice she knew how to handle such a lover . But when morning came she leaped from the rude bed in terror . Good God , what 's that ? ' It was the blue heron uttering his hideous yet reassuring cry . The Indians call him Fishing-long-legs , ' he whispered , laughing gently at her fright . His night with her had been an experience of great joy , and he reached for one of her long , handsome legs to pull her down beside him again . We 've work to do , ' she reprimanded , and the next sixteen months were a revelation . Meg Shipton , raised in squalid London quarters , took to the island as if she had been reared on farms . She sweated to help plow the fields on which the wealth of this enterprise depended and grew greasy-black from tending the fires that burned away the bark of tall trees that had to be cleared from new fields . She grew skillful in collecting crabs and oysters , and came to enjoy the two Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you place corn in hot water mixed with wood ashes . The lye eats away the yellow covering , leaving only the white insides . So delicious fried in venison drippings . ' And yet , for all her voluntary work and the eagerness with which she helped Steed build a real house , she was somehow reserved in her relations with him ; they had wild delights beneath the covers , but he sensed that she held him in some kind of contempt . They talked freely , but she always seemed to be laughing at him , and he gained the impression that she was being compatible only because she owed him a debt . Often he caught her looking at him quizzically , and he tried to determine in what way he had failed her , but whenever he came close to touching upon this subject , she drew back and smiled at him indulgently . But in spite of her obvious reserve about him , she never disciplined him in bed : he had agreed to buy her and she was his . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant , and this galvanized him into insisting on various kinds of action : We 've got to cross the bay . You ca n't have a baby till you 're married . ' She replied , It looks as if that 's what I 'm doing . ' And she was doing it rather well , too , with the help of advice she was receiving from the women Pentaquod had sent from the village . It was now that Steed began a frenzy of building , not a house and not  | a barn . For some days Meg could n't decipher what it was , but then Chief Pentaquod appeared on the island with four helpers who cut and planked oak trees while Steed served as architect . Finally the building was done , a solid , low structure with a rude signboard over the door on which Steed had printed : Surely the Lord lives in this place . This is none other than the house of God . This is the gateway to heaven . Genesis XXVIII . When Meg asked what this signified , Steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches Pentaquod had made . These are solemn times , ' he said . The birth of a baby . The start of a new family . ' The baby 's no problem , ' she said , slapping her expanding belly . Steed ignored the jest . Grasping her reverently by both hands , he announced solemnly , I 'm a Catholic . This is to be our chapel . ' Meg stared at him , then burst into laughter . A bloody Papist ! ' Shoving his hands away , she rose from the bench and moved to the door , where she broke into uncontrolled giggles , not mocking him or his chapel , but rather , ridiculing herself . A Papist ! ' she repeated . Then she came back to him , kissed him on the forehead and said , It 's jolly . And what a surprise those farts in Jamestown will get when they hear about it . ' Her words offended Steed , and he drew back , but she continued her lively laughter . I think it 's wonderful , Edmund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then she broke into laughter again , unable to control herself . Meg Shipton , wedded to a Papist ! ' She left the chapel , still chuckling , and refused to set foot in it again . She was having trouble with Pentaquod , too . Never having known a father , she had at first found this white-haired old man reassuring . She liked his stately mannerisms and his stories of how the Indians had lived before the white man came : Turtles ! Two or three times a year one would swim into our river . Delicious . ' He owned a gun now , which he fired ceremoniously once a month , hitting nothing , and a heavy ax which he wielded with startling power , felling the trees used in building the chapel . And when he found an oak of proper size , he directed Steed and the two Indian helpers in burning out the center and making a canoe so massive that it required four men to handle it . For the baby , ' he told Meg . She wanted to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . As Steed 's woman she merited his deference and he protected her as he would any pregnant woman , but consistently he rejected her rather blatant efforts to win him as a friend , and in the end she told Steed petulantly , Get him out of here , ' and Pentaquod was sent back to the village .  | With the Indian gone , she became surprisingly tender , conceding one day , ' It 's been rather good here , Steed . When you take your beaver pelts to Jamestown , you might as well pay Janney his eight pounds ... if you think I 'm still worth it . ' ' You are ! ' he cried enthusiastically . ' Maybe I 'll even go with you . . . get married proper . ' The child was born on March 3 , 1616 , the first white infant on the Eastern Shore , a robust boy in whom the Indian women took delight . Meg allowed them to tend him pretty much as they wished , laughing heartily when they tossed him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good sign when a boy floats , ' they assured her . ' With a girl it do n't matter . ' His first playthings were a deer 's antler and a bear 's claw ; his first attempted sound was the kraannk of the heron . In August , Edmund Steed packed his bateau with cords of trade goods and lashed the new canoe astern to house the overflow . When the last pail of caviar was stowed , Steed called to Meg , ' We 're ready for the sail . ' On the first day in Jamestown he would pay for her , and on the second make her his wife . As she came down the path to the wharf , wearing a dress made from cloth woven on the island , carrying the baby easily on her hip , she was fair and buxom and laughing , and Steed knew a greater happiness than he had ever before experienced : this strange , secretive , passionate woman he had stumbled upon was a treasure , precisely the kind required to build an empire . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnace sailed into the mouth of the creek , dropped its canvas and moved slowly to the wharf . In the bow stood a determined Simon Janney , impatient to leap ashore , and Steed had to assume that he had come to fight for Meg , whose passage money had not yet been repaid and who was theoretically still his property . In the moment before the pinnace landed , Steed had to decide what he would do , the extent of his love for Meg . His two years with her had satisfied him that not in all Virginia could he find a better wife ; there could be no equal to the way she had worked in the fields , no mother happier with her son , and even if she did frequently refuse Steed entrance to her inner thoughts , she had been exciting and satisfying . Meg Shipton was worth holding on to , and he would fight Janney to keep her . As soon as the pinnace touched , the sturdy little farmer leaped ashore and rushed right at Steed , who resolutely presented his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Steed he extended his arms and cried , ' Steed , great news ! ' Steed dropped his hands and asked , ' What ? ' ' I can take Meg home . You owe me nothing . ' ' Meg has a child , ' Steed said , pointing to where the handsome woman stood with the baby .  | No matter ! ' Janney cried in great excitement . She .. He never finished the sentence , for at the rear of the pinnace appeared a woman , dressed in a cape which in spite of the August heat she held close to her throat . She was tall , slender , dark of hair and with hands that were extremely white . She moved hesitantly , picking her way over bundles cluttering the deck , and with the help of sailors climbed carefully onto the wharf , where she adjusted her cape . But once ashore , all hesitancy vanished . Walking firmly , she came up the wharf , passed the two men and went directly to where Meg stood with the baby . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , thin hand . And this I presume is your daughter . ' Son , ' Meg said suspiciously . You can go back to Jamestown , Meg , ' the visitor said . I 'm the new mistress of the island . ' She is ! ' Janney cried happily . Your father sent her , Steed . ' Now the tall woman turned slowly to face the man whose invitation had brought her to this remote island , and she came to him with the same resolution she had shown in tackling Meg . Extending her hand once more , she said , Edmund Steed , I bring you greetings from your father . I am Martha Keene of High Wycombe in Bucks . ' Steed could manage nothing , not even a stammering welcome , but Simon Janney moved forward , ready to handle any eventuality  --  except the strange one that now developed . She 's a fine woman , Edmund , ' he said rapidly . Everyone on shipboard respected her . ' Mr. Janney has my boxes in the pinnace , ' the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finality to her arrival , Janney said , Now Meg can come home with me . ' That I will never do , ' Meg said . With exaggerated gestures she handed the baby to Martha Keene , saying , You can have the little bastard , and the big one too . ' She looked at Steed and sniffed . They 're both yours , Mistress Keene . I 've been ready to get out of here for some time . ' Meg ! ' Steed cried . Boat 's loaded . Let 's be off ! ' And she flounced toward the shore , with Simon Janney attempting to stop her , to grab her , to do anything to get her into his pinnace . I 'm to take you back , ' he pleaded softly . The fees are paid . ' She had had enough . Planting her feet resolutely on the wharf , her arms akimbo , she surveyed Janney and Steed contemptuously and cried , Damn you both . You paid this and you paid that and you offered to buy . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands red to build this island . I 'd have done the same for you , Janney , if you 'd given me a decent house . But now all talk of buying and selling is ended . Shove your fees up your arse and to hell with both of you . ' Steed was too shocked to make a response , but Janney asked in a whisper , Where will you go , Meg ? '  | ' To Jamestown . To someone who appreciates a wife for what she is . ' To Steed 's surprise , she reserved her greatest bitterness for him . Regarding him scornfully , she railed , ' Trap your beavers and build your chapels and be damned to you . ' Steed gasped . He had never suspected she harbored such bitterness , and in the fire of her rejection she seemed even more desirable than when she had passively accepted him because of her gratitude for his offering her a refuge . It was Martha Keene who best comprehended what was happening . With the stateliness inherent in a large family accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf , holding the baby , and asked quietly , ' Are you in good mind . . . to leave your child ? ' ' Take the Papist bastard and be damned . He 'll amount to nothing , and if I should feel need of another , I can catch one . ' Mistress Keene offered a response that would be long remembered in the Choptank : she took Meg 's hand , brought it to her lips and kissed it . ' You will have better days , ' she said quietly . ' And thank you for the child . What 's his name ? ' ' Ralph , ' Meg said , and to everyone 's surprise she climbed down not into Janney 's pinnace nor into Steed 's bateau but into the stout oak canoe . ' This is my boat , ' she said grandly . ' We 're off to Jamestown . ' No appeal from Janney could dislodge her from her perch among the heaver pelts , and Steed , shocked by her disclosures , made no effort to lure her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . To Mistress Keene she shouted , ' You 'll be insisting upon a proper marriage , I should think . Join me and we 'll find a priest somewheres . ' It had been Martha Keene 's intention to sail back with Steed for a ceremony , but Meg 's insulting behavior forestalled this . Taking Steed far from the wharf , but keeping the baby in her arms , she confided , ' Your fat her chose me because I 'm Catholic . My family has suffered as deeply as yours , and to me the faith is precious . ' She spoke crisply and with authority , as if she had read books and in them learned of Sir Latimer 's martyrdom . She was only twenty-two that summer , but aged in wisdom . Your father foresaw difficulties and so did mine . They agreed that if they arose , I might wait with you on the island until such time as a priest arrived . ' ' It could be years . ' know . ' ' And you will be my wife till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led her to the log chapel , where , after pausing to read the inscription from Genesis , she knelt to give thanks for her safe arrival . When she ' ' ftoae , Steed took her by the hands and said , ' You must understand . I could not have built this island , nor this chapel ? '  | Without Meg , ' she interrupted . I do understand , but now it 's we who live here . ' She kissed him , then smiled as she heard Meg bellowing from her canoe , ordering the boats to sail for Jamestown . She accompanied Steed to the wharf , watched as he boarded the bateau and hoisted sail . She stood there firm-chinned , holding the baby as the three craft stood out for the Choptank . Three weeks later , when Steed 's bateau headed back into Devon Creek , he experienced a welter of confusions . His trading trip to Jamestown had been an unprecedented success  --  he was returning not only with more trade goods than he had expected but also with several Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon Janney eight pounds for Meg Shipton . But mixed with his elation was uneasiness over the fact that when his boat landed at Devon he would be alone with the stranger who was now his wife . He knew nothing of her except that she had been chosen by his father , that she came from the neighboring county of Bucks and that she was Catholic . In the brief moments he had spoken with her she had seemed quite austere , but she may have felt the same about him ; in her favor she had adjusted with remarkable ease to the extraordinary behavior of Meg Shipton and had accepted the baby without apparent qualms . One further thing : at least three fellow passengers from Captain Hackett 's Victorious had sought Steed out to assure him that in Martha Keene he was catching himself a wonderful woman : She was most helpful on seasick days , and she a lady . ' Asquas and the other Indians had seen the Devon bateau approaching , and they were waiting on the wharf as it lowered its sails , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into position one of the women went to fetch her . This was not necessary ; Martha was tardy only because she had been attending the baby ; now , carrying it as if she were a madonna , she came from the hut to greet her returning husband . Steed would never forget this moment . He had been directing the Indians how to unload and bore in his arms a heavy bundle of cloth , its tag ends blowing in the breeze , when he saw her picking her way carefully down the path and onto the wharf . She moved with studied grace , as if entering a church , and carried the child as if it were her own . Her pale face was rimmed by a black cloth tied about her head , but her eyes and lips joined in a smile of welcome that seemed to Steed the warmest human expression he had ever seen . Dropping the bundled cloth , he leaped ashore and ran to her , embracing her and kissing her in front of the startled Indians . I am so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my home , ' she said . But Steed would always be a special kind of Catholic , a poetic traditionalist : five thousand years of Celtic poetry onto which had been grafted a thousand years of Saxon prudence . He could never rest easily with Martha Keene until they had been married ritually , and when in December he discussed it with her , he found that she , too , was experiencing a heavy burden of sin . They tried to ease their conscience by embellishing the chapel , the first such Catholic structure in Virginia , with a rude crucifix which he carved and a purple cloth which she wove and stained , as if this would impart sanction . But as the new year dawned , she asked abruptly , ' Would the werowance marry us ... in his fashion ? ' That very day they sailed upstream to Patamoke , and as soon as Pentaquod saw the new woman , so austere and formal , he said in Choptank , ' Steed , this one is much better . ' ' We want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . ' ' I was afraid she 'd run away . ' ' I , too , ' the old chief said , and as he spoke his eyes wandered to Tciblento , who had been listening to the conversation , and he wondered why it was that this man had been unable to find in his daughter the wife he needed . A most perplexing matter , for in his first glimpse of Meg Shipton he had known that Steed must not marry her ; she was swift and darting like the black duck and no man could catch her . The new one would be strong and stable , like Onk-or the goose , a good wife but lacking in fire . And all the time there stood Tciblento , the finest woman this river had produced , or ever would produce , and he had found no way to convince Steed of this truth . It was indeed perplexing , as if the Englishman had a film over his eyes which prevented him from seeing the excellence of an Indian . Nevertheless , Pentaquod arranged a stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all members of the tribe assembled in tribute to a man they had grown to trust . The shaman chanted blessings and midwives predicted that the union would be fruitful . Crabs and fish and beaver pelts were laid before the gods , who , properly propitiated , could be trusted to give their protection to this marriage . Four children from the tribe brought flowers for Mistress Keene to stand upon and four boys handed Steed a long pipe and an arrow tipped with eagle feathers . Then Pentaquod spoke in words that Martha could not understand . Ile referred to himself and Steed as two strangers who had come to this tribe , and who had found happiness and good lives along this river . He pointed out that both he and Steed had taken alien women to be their brides and that often such things worked well , as had been proved in his cue . He then said that when a man goes to a new place , and takes a new bride , he associates himself forever with the fortunes of that place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide it in peace . Steed had proved that he was the good neighbor . The Indians working on Devon Island had assured him that Steed 's wife would be a good neighbor , too , and he blessed them both for coming to this river . Steed had tears in his eyes when the old man finished , and so did Tciblento , who appreciated with terrible intensity the appropriateness of what her father had said . While the werowance was conducting the ceremony she had tried , desperately she tried , to keep her dark eyes away from Steed , but in the end she could not . Looking at him with a longing that consumed her , she asked that question which has no answer : Why ? Why ? When the bateau delivered the couple back to the island , Martha said , The little Indian girl with the braids . . . the one with the dark eyes ... she 's in love with you , Edmund . ' Tciblento ? She 's Pentaquod 's daughter . ' Why did n't you marry her . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha never mentioned the matter again , but later , when Tciblento offered to visit the island to help instruct her in Indian ways , she politely refused , and sometimes whole months would pass without the Steeds ' seeing Tciblento , but one day in 1619 Pentaquod himself came to Devon to inform the settlers that his daughter was to be married , and he would be pleased if they would attend the ceremony . They did , and Martha saw that the Indian girl , now twenty-three and beautiful in her dress of deerskin adorned with beaver and porcupine quills marrying amounted to little and she doubted that he would ever inherit the title of werowance . In these years the Steeds paid Pentaquod and the Choptanks substantial sums for any new land they occupied . They now owned 2,16o acres on Devon Island , the exact extent having been calculated by Martha , with the aid of careful measurements made by her husband . Only a few were under cultivation , but they also had title to another 2,488 acres on the mainland . None of this had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn down the trees as soon as he had trained enough Indians to tend the fields , from which he would send increasing boatloads of corn to Jamestown . It was in 1626 that Steed 's fortunes took a radical turn , after which the clearing of additional acres became an urgent necessity . In December of that year he had guided his bateau back to Jamestown with a heavy cargo of corn , beaver , sassafras and caviar , and as he was unloading onto a two-masted ship from London , he found that a crude river boat from  | somewhere up the James was unloading on the opposite side of the trader . It was Simon Janney , and the cargo he was hefting about with the aid of ropes was new to Steed . ' What are those great bales ? ' he asked . ' The stinking weed , ' Janney replied . ' Tobacco ? Is there profit in tobacco ? ' ' The surest , ' Janney said . ' Where 's your farm ? ' ' Far upstream . ' A silence , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' More silence , then , ' What happened to her ? ' Janney did not care to answer this . ' If you have cleared land , Steed , you should consider tobacco . Difficult to grow but easy to sell . ' ' I spend my acres on corn . ' ' Switch to tobacco , You 'll never regret . ' ' And where 's Meg ? ' Janney kicked at one of the bales , then confessed , ' Two hours after she climbed out of her canoe at Jamestown she met a man looking for a wife . Before nightfall he had paid me her transit money and as soon as proper he married her . She lives in one of the new houses on the riverbank . ' Steed saw her once . She carried a parasol and wore a large straw hat edged with gold ribbon , her blond hair peeking out provocatively to glisten in the sun . She walked with a light step and seemed to be smiling to herself , even before she spotted her former husband , as Steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Steed of Devon beside the road , she nodded gravely , smiled slightly , as if unable to control her inward laughter , and passed on . Her husband , men at the wharf told Steed , was a man of growing importance in the colony . But it was Simon Janney who made the lasting impression during this 1626 trip , for when both Steed 's boat and his own were unloaded he led the islander to a tavern , where they talked seriously for a long time . ' If you have good land at the ready , Edmund , you should plant tobacco instantly . I have more seed than I need , and I 'd be prepared to bring it to Devon to get you started , providing you 'd share profits with me . ' ' You said difficult to grow . How difficult ? ' ' Many pitfalls . You must watch the land it does n't grow musty . Nor get too much heat . And it 's best if you have a shed for drying , but even if you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night discussing the cultivation of this delicate plant , and toward morning Janney convinced Steed to take the gamble . ' I 'd not bother you , Steed , if I had land of my own available , but the Indians are fractious . My wife and I have not been able to clear ? ' ' What wife ? '  | Captain Hackett brought her over . One hundred and thirty-seven of them . All disposed of within two days . Mine 's scrawny but she can work . ' Mrs. Janney had been a serving girl in London , made pregnant by the master , who fell sobbing in his wife 's arms with the lament : She tempted me , that one . ' She had been hauled into court by the clergy and condemned for a harlot ; when her child was stillborn everyone involved deemed it best that she be sent to Virginia , so her mistress paid her passage with Captain Hackett . He , of course , conveniently forgot that her passage had been paid and offered her for sale upon arrival , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scrawny . She had excited no bidding in the , early stages of the auction , for she was certainly not a prime prospect , but this did not deter Hackett . Someone 's bound to want you , ' he kept assuring her . Women are at a premium . . . any women . ' And even when she and two other ungainly scarecrows stood alone at the end of the line , the captain was still confident that he would uncover some ill-favored planter who would need her . Simon Janney was that man . Once bitterly disappointed in this game , he haggled with Hackett over price , and when a bargain was reached he took her west . This time he encountered no problem in holding his woman ; for her , he represented a final haven . Steed remained longer in Jamestown than he had intended , because Janney insisted that he sail far up the James to inspect the tobacco fields , and when they landed at the rickety wharf and he saw the foul conditions in which Janney lived , he appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Janney said as Steed entered his hovel . He saw an emaciated woman in a torn dress . Her teeth were bad and her hair unkempt . But when she and her husband took him out to inspect their fields he found all things neat and trimmed , and he understood their strategy : fields first . These are handsome acres , Simon , ' he said . Do they yield good tobacco ? ' They do . And if I could trust the Indians to help , I 'd clear those beyond the trees . ' Help may be a long time coming , ' Steed said , thinking of how peaceful the Choptanks were and how dangerous the Potomacs . There 's talk of bringing in more blacks from Africa , ' Janney said . But even then us little planters would be at the far end of the barrel . We 'd see none of them . ' You must have help to clear this country , ' Steed agreed . He then watched as Janney unriddled the mysteries of growing tobacco , the cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never smoked tobacco and was most doubtful that the fad would be permanent , but when he was told of the earnings Janney had made on his  | small fields , his cupidity was aroused . ' Could I do the same on my big ones ? ' he asked . ' Better ! I studied your fields when I went to fetch Meg . ' This mournful recollection slowed his enthusiasm , so on a more subdued level he argued , Steed , with your fields and your Indians you could treble what I earn . ' They reached an agreement whereby Janney would collect as much tobacco seed as possible , then follow Steed to Devon , where he would show the Indians how to grow what he called the stinking weed . ' When he arrived , Steed and his wife talked Pentaquod into lending them six additional Choptanks to till the fields and tend the delicate plants . They also built along the shore a pair of long sheds for drying the leaf , and Janney taught them how to construct oaken hogsheads . A substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvested and cured , the great hogsheads were rolled down to the wharf where Captain Hackett docked his Victorious . Custom already required that Virginians , as colonists , send their precious tobacco only to the mother country , and only in English ships . This meant that Captain Hackett and his storm-racked Victorious exercised a monopoly which paid the colonists meagerly and the factors in London well . Even so , when shiploads of trade goods began pouring back into Devon , delighting the Indians along the Choptank , Steed realized that he was on his way to building a fortune . He was goaded to even greater profits by Janney , who pointed out that since Steed could use Indians , he really must develop the copious lands he owned on the north bank . So in 1631 Steed assembled a work force of himself , Janney and seven new Indians to clear massive fields across the channel , the agreement being as before : Janney would return to Jamestown once the fields were prepared and come back with tobacco seed , sharing in whatever profits were realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky as Indians knelt about the trunks of towering oaks and loblolly pine , girdling them and forcing them to die . On fields where the trunks had been earlier burned , ropes were attached to upper branches , now dead , and the forest sentinels were pulled down . Then Steed and Janney would wait for a rainy day , when danger of fire spreading out of control was at a minimum , and on such days they would light vast conflagrations to burn away the fallen trees , for which they could devise no use . For weeks the sky over the Choptank would be black with smoke and the men even blacker with soot . ' We 're making our fortunes ! ' Janney exulted . ' And when we 've finished here , we 'll transport these Indians across the bay and burn off some new forests I 've spotted along the Rappahannock . ' ' Would you leave your farm on the James ? '  | For me it 's been an unfortunate river . ' Why not come here ? Take up land along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation . The center of life will always be over there . ' And no argument could persuade him to quit the western shore , where the great fortunes would be gathered , the lasting reputations forged . Captain John Smith had become a garrulous old man who bored his London cronies with rambling tales of Hungary and Virginia . It was not until many years after his flight from the colony and the death of the Indian princess Pocahontas that he revealed that when Chief Powhatan had spared him from the chopping block , it was only because the lovely princess had thrown herself across his , Smith 's , prostrate body . She loved me , ' he confided , desperately she loved me . ' Then why did she marry Rolfe and not you ? ' asked a man who had known Pocahontas when she visited the English court . Marry ! ' Smith snorted . An English captain dally with an Indian maid ? Let alone marry her ! That 's for lesser men like young Rolfe . ' He was dismayed when travelers from Virginia informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jamestown , had finally disclosed his true colors and stood forth as a Catholic . A Papist ? ' he repeated several times , shaking his head incredulously . Then his mind cleared and he remembered his adventures with this gallant young man . He came close to death , that one . They were cutting the flesh off poor Ratcliffe , inch by inch , and the poor fellow died . No regrets from me . He 'd voted at Nevis to have me hanged , but I stormed back in time to save young Steed . ' It had n't happened that way . Smith had been long gone before Ratcliffe died . I was with him in the sickness , too . Steed , that is , not Ratcliffe . In one tent seven of us dead with the flux , except that I fought back . Steed shared his last food with me . ' There had been other adventures , but Smith could not recall them now . I remember I had to correct his writing . Careless about details . And I must confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him once . Not clear , like a decent Englishman . A Papist , eh ? I knew he was hiding something . ' In succeeding months Smith spoke often of Steed and cited his subversive Catholicism as an example of why King Charles should not confer favors on the Catholic Lords Baltimore . The idea of granting them a colony in Virginia ! Shameful ! Papists will take over the continent . Devious , they are . Steed 's grandfather , you know , had to be hanged and quartered by Good Queen Bess . All devious . ' Before the year was out he was dead , lamenting the dark changes  | engineered by the two kings , James and Charles . One of his last judgments was that things had been much better handled by Elizabeth . Pentaquod had foreseen that when the white man came to the Choptank , all traditions of Indian life would be in jeopardy , and he had willingly come out of retirement to help his tribe make the transition . What he had not foreseen were the curious ways in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any white man to be as congenial as the one who settled on Devon Island , nor to have in common with him those problems encountered by all men : trouble with women , the constant fight for food , difficulty in rearing children , safeguarding whatever gains had been made . On three different occasions Indian messengers from across the bay had come to the Choptanks , hoping to lead them in rebellion against the whites : on a specified day Pentaquod would murder all of them on Devon , then storm across the bay to slaughter and burn along the James and the Rappahannock . Each time he had replied , Steed is a friend more to be trusted than most of our own . ' Not only had he refused to kill Steed , he had sent extra Choptanks to guard the island against Potomac efforts . So when hideous massacres scarred the western shore , nothing happened on the eastern . Relationships with Steed were better than could have been expected . On the other hand , he had been mortally hurt when the quiet Englishman rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter did , too . Indians were inferior , and any contact between the races must be kept to the level of work and trade . The old man was appalled at the eagerness with which his people grabbed for whatever geegaws white traders dangled before them . Here was the danger , Pentaquod saw : that the values of his people might be destroyed . For the present they were content to keep on fishing and hunting beaver and digging sassafras and tending their corn , but the day would come when the old pursuits would be abandoned , and on that day the Choptanks would begin to diminish . He was meticulous in not interfering with the prerogatives of the young werowance . He had come back to serve as senior counsel , and in spite of great pressures to resume the leadership , he restricted himself to t hat role . He did so from deep conviction : the younger men must learn how to work with whites if they hoped to bring their people through these perilous times . Therefore , when Captain Smith first appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the werowance might have experience in estimating the newcomers ' intentions , and in all dealings with Steed , Pentaquod effaced himself . When the deeds to  | Devon Island had to be signed , it was the werowance who made the first mark . The old man did retain his three turkey feathers , and as he moved among the Choptanks they knew that he was their leader , and it was to him that they looked whenever crisis neared . Now they came to him , perplexed . Each day new fires rage , ' they protested . They consume all the trees between the rivers where we used to hide . ' So Pentaquod got into his canoe and paddled downriver to talk with Steed . Is it necessary to burn the ancient trees ? ' It is . ' With such desolation ? ' And he pointed to deer fleeing the flames and a bewildered beaver clinging to his lodge as fire approached . We must have more fields for tobacco , ' Steed explained . We grow all the tobacco we can smoke , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women of his tribe had cultivated the weed . Enough for you , but not enough for London . ' Must we burn our forests for London ? ' the old man asked . Steed found it difficult to clarify the intricacies of transocean trading , to explain that it was not only obligatory but morally imperative to burn forests in Virginia so that tobacco might be burned in London . Pentaquod could not understand . Three times he returned to protest this abuse of the Choptank forests , and on the last visit Simon Janney grew impatient . Knowing no Choptank words , he would not allow the old man to waste precious time . Shoving him aside , he growled , Be gone , old man ! We 've work to do . ' Pentaquod returned to his canoe , defeated . Heavily he plied his paddle , and when he reached the village he informed the werowance that soon something must be done to halt these hungry fires . The two leaders talked a long time , neither willing to face up to the inevitable : fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , two young members of the tribe ran in with harsh news : Pentaquod ! They have set fires which will burn your refuge ! ' Together the two leaders paddled down past the marsh and up the small river to the forked creek where Pentaquod once lived , and as they approached they saw vast fires creeping in from many sides , erasing the field Navitan had cultivated for yams , burning away the spot where Tciblento had been born , destroying the trees in which his sons had kept their bear cubs . As the two Indians watched , the crackling grew stronger , until it seemed as if the creek itself might boil , and then all was gone : the trees , the small wharf , the memories of Tciblento playing by the house . Transfixed , Pentaquod refused to believe that men would destroy everything for tobacco leaves , but they had .  | ' We must go back , ' Pentaquod told the werowance , and that night they made their decision : it was impossible to live side-by-side with the white man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and next morning when Steed and Janney prepared to set new fires they found no Indians to help them . Steed assumed that they must have slept the night at Devon with their friends , but when he sailed his small boat home he found that not only were the field crew missing , but the island Indians as well , including their wives . ' Canoes came for them last night , ' Martha reported . ' Took everything with them . I doubt they 'll be coming back . ' ' Impossible ! Where 'd they go ? ' ' To their village , I judge . ' Without waiting to collect Janney , he sailed as speedily as he could to Patamoke , and there his Indians were , sitting disconsolately before the long hut . ' What are you doing here ? ' he demanded , but none would speak . When he repeated his question , one of the wives gestured toward the door of the hut . ' Did they make you leave us ? ' Steed shouted . His loud voice alerted the werowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face the white man . In a moment Pentaquod appeared , leaning on the shoulder of Tciblento . Together the three Indians approached Steed , and on the face of each showed the respect they held for this honest Englishman . It was a moment that would never be forgotten by any participant , for this was the day when parting became inevitable . ' What are you doing to me ? ' Steed asked the werowance . The young man remained silent . Pentaquod nudged him , but still he was afraid to speak . It was the old man who responded : ' What have you done to us ? Burned our pines . Cut down our tallest oaks . Driven deer from their homes and beaver from their lodges . Singed the feathers of birds and torn down the places where our children played . Steed , you have destroyed the paradise we shared with you . ' Steed fell back before this torrent of accusation , then said persuasively , ' Pentaquod , dear and trusted friend , you do not understand . If we burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow more tobacco , Captain Hackett 's ship will come more often . And when it does , you and your people can have guns for hunting . ' ' Before you came we earned our meat without guns . ' ' But you can have mirrors , too , and compasses like the one Captain Smith gave you . Remember ? ' ' I have always known where north was , ' the old man said . Then , in tones of bitter sadness , he informed Steed that henceforth no Choptanks would work for him , and no pleas from the Englishman reversed this harsh decision . In the midst of the great sweep to clear the fields , Steed 's entire labor force was retracted ; not even one woman was  | permitted to help Martha and her three children . When Janney learned of the decision he proposed that they sail to Jamestown , conscript an army and burn the village unless the Indians returned to work , but Steed ridiculed such folly . Instead he and Janney stayed overnight at Patamoke , and in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was granted , and once more the white-haired old man appeared leaning upon his beautiful daughter . The realization that old ties were about to be shattered saddened the former leader , and he spoke gently to his friend . What is it , Steed ? ' Pentaquod , ally of many years , why do you harm us ? ' There is no way that you and we can share this river . ' But we can ! Your children and mine play together , speak the same tongue , love the same animals . ' No , Steed . In all things we grow apart . The time for separation is upon us . No need . When Captain Hackett 's ship comes you can have all the things we have . ' We do not want your things . They bring us only trouble . ' When this was translated for Janney he wanted Steed to tell the old fool that if the Indians refused to work , they 'd find out what real trouble was  --  even war . Such words Steed refused to translate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what the other Englishman had said . War ? ' Pentaquod repeated . You speak of war ? Do you know what happened across the bay when war came ? Countless dead and hatred forever . Have you subdued the Potomacs or driven the Piscataways from your rivers , Janney ? Steed and I have striven to see that such war does not scar our friendship , nor will it while I live . ' Steed ignored this line of argument and did not translate for Janney , who sat glaring at the old man . What Steed focused on was labor . Pentaquod , if you send your men to work for us , we 'll pay them ... well . ' And what will they buy with the roanoke ? ' What they wish . ' And he spread his hands to indicate the largesse of Europe . Pentaquod brushed aside this irrelevant logic and reminded Steed : When you and your wife needed our help to build a home on your island , we worked for you . And when you wanted to clear fields to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people to instruct you in all skills you needed . Did not my own daughter Tciblento offer to instruct your wives ? ' Steed looked at the Indian girl , dressed in deerskin ornamented with fringes of mink and a necklace of beaver teeth , and for the first time realized what an amazingly beautiful woman she had become . His vision  | was cleared , perhaps , by the realization that after this fateful day there would be no more meetings . He became aware that he was blushing and that his eyes held on to hers for a shameful period , but he was incapable of looking away . Then he shook his head as if to awaken , and conceded , ' Tciblento was most helpful . ' Sadly the old man announced , ' Steed , on this day we leave our village . You will see us no more . ' ' No ! ' Steed pleaded . ' During many moons I have told my people that you and we could share the river , but I was wrong . You will always want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to your fires . ' Janney asked , ' What 's he threatening now ? ' ' They 're leaving , ' Steed said . ' Good ! ' Janney said with sudden approval . ' Help them along . Kick them out . ' ' What do you mean ? ' Steed asked , but before the tough little countryman could explain , Pentaquod took Steed aside to ask a question which had perplexed him for years . ' Dear friend , ' he said , ' many summers ago when the Great Canoe came into the bay , our people watched it carefully . They saw the white sails , but they also saw that the men had skins that glistened . What was this , Steed ? ' The Englishman pondered the question but could find no reasonable explanation , so Pentaquod repeated the problem , indicating himself on the deck of the ancient ship , with sun glinting from his body . ' Oh ! ' Steed exclaimed . ' It must have been a Spanish ship . Armor ! ' And he explained how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Pentaquod broached the matter that truly disturbed him . ' In later days , when I am gone , the Choptanks will return to this village . Will you watch over Tciblento ? ' Steed did not reply . Tears so filled the old man 's eyes that no further words were necessary . They embraced , returned to the long hut , and separated for the last time . Tciblento stood on the riverbank as they started their sail homeward , a radiant woman , not waving goodbye , not tearful , just standing there in fading light aware that never again in this life would she see the fair Englishman . When the bateau reached the marsh Janney said excitedly , ' We 're lucky to be rid of the lazy swine . ' ' But what are we going to do for help ? ' ' Ships bring many an indentured lad to Jamestown . ' ' Can we afford them ? ' ' Secret is , buy them cheap , work them to the bone . And when their seven years are up , kiss them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | added , But better times are coming . They 've begun to bring whole shiploads of slaves from Africa . Captain Hackett offers them for sale . ' Same question . Can we afford them ? ' Look , Steed . You ca n't afford not to have them . You buy a slave once , he 's yours for life . He and his children . Best bargain ever offered . ' But it was not as simple as Janney had proposed . Slaves did not arrive by shipload , and those that did straggle in as part of a cargo were kept in Virginia ; they were too valuable to be wasted on uncertain fields across the bay . So as the Indians departed , their place was taken by white men from the dregs of London , but the bulk of the work was done by Steed and his wife . Theirs was the only plantation on the Eastern Shore , a daring , lonely outpost where the proprietors worked fifteen and sixteen hours a day , the unremitting toil always required if a home or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in raising tobacco , from hoarding the precious seed  --  ten thousand did not fill a teaspoon  --  to topping the young plants , an operation which prevented useless leaves from proliferating high on the stalk and ensured a few big rich leaves at workable height ; it had to be performed during the hottest days of July and August , when heat shimmered on still waters . Then Steed moved among his plants , nipping off tops by catching them between his right thumbnail and forefinger ; in time his right hand grew larger and stronger than his left , his right thumbnail huge and dark and thick . One morning at breakfast Martha Keene  --  she would not adopt the name Steed before she was properly married  --  noticed the discoloration on Edmund 's thumb and surprised him by leaning across the table and kissing it  --  The badge of our real nobility . ' At that time in distant England , Edmund 's older brother held the baronetcy and was known as Sir Philip Steed , but in the New World a new nobility was being born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the founding families . When Martha Keene had volunteered to emigrate to Virginia , she performed an act of courage oft repeated , rarely appreciated ; but when she moved on to the isolation of Dover Island , it was sheer heroism . How did she survive ? Precariously . There was no doctor and only the slightest medication : calomel for indigestion , sassafras tea for fever . Constipation was a constant fear , for it could lead to more serious ills , so every family had its favorite purge ; the ague was also a torment . Teeth were a special problem , and each locality owned one pair of forceps , worn and rusty , for the yanking away of rotting molars , plus some strong-armed man with good eyesight who did the job ; two men held the patient by the shoulders , another lay across his knees , and the for- ceps would go to work , twisting and pulling until something shattered . Mothers watched with anguish as their children contracted an endless chain of diseases , sitting awake through fevered nights and grieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , if the children survived this deadly assault , they developed an immunity that was striking ; often they would live from eighteen through forty-eight with scarce an illness , rocklike people who could resist cold and hunger and poor nutrition , but by then they were elders and at fifty they were usually dead . Women especially died young , and it was not unusual for one husband to bury two wives before he left a young widow to survive him for twenty years . The house to which Martha came had been much improved by its former occupant , the lively Meg Shipton , but it was still little more than a primitive hut . It was superbly sited : as you left the Chesapeake your shallop moved due east through the channel north of the island , then turned south to enter the broad estuary leading to Devon Creek . A mile up that deep body of water brought you to a wharf projecting out from the northern shore , and above the wharf , on a small plateau of fine level land overlooking vast distances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first a shack , then a separate kitchen located to the east so that the sun reached it at dawn , then a second floor with bedrooms fearfully cold in winter , and finally some connected sheds and storage areas . Meager furniture slapped together from local wood , sparse utensils carved from oak , a few knives and forks with spoons of wood , those were the things Martha had to work with . She had one iron kettle , suspended by a hook over an open fire , and a kind of iron-and-clay oven in which she performed miracles . A low fire was kept burning day and night , fueled by immense piles of wood outside the door . The place had few blankets but many animal skins , which in some ways were better , for t hey showed little soiling , and no sheets . Clothing was precious , a man 's trousers lasting for twelve or fifteen years of constant use , a woman 's dress surviving innumerable alterations and additions . Adornments were few , and those which a husband did bring were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities , one which infuriated Martha , one which provided foolish contentment . Since there was little glass in Jamestown and none in Devon , the Steeds had covered their windows with oiled paper , itself a precious commodity , and a score of times Martha , contemplating windows which allowed light but not vision , would catch herself complaining , I do wish we had glass that someone could see through , ' and each time a ship left their wharf for Bristol she begged , Ca n't they bring back some Holland glass ? ' What pleased her were the heavy pewter dishes ; they had a solid quality , and to see them ailed neatly in their pine cupboard was an experience she treasured . I  | value them more than silver , ' she told her husband , and as she washed them , she exulted : They are mine . Labor was specialized , for with the arrival of slaves at Jamestown it became practical for plantation managers there to cultivate particular skills among them . Slave women who could sew were taken indoors ; men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those blacks who could convert oak trees into staves , and staves into hogsheads for shipping tobacco . Poor Steed , without access to slaves , had to master all the mechanical arts himself , then teach them to new servants as they reached Devon . It was a thankless task ; he would spend two years instructing some clumsy lad how to shape a barrel , then enjoy only four years of profitable work from the young man , because the seventh year was largely wasted : the servant spent most of that time trying to locate land of his own on which to start a farm . Steed became the master teacher of the Eastern Shore , and Devon the university through which the Choptank would be civilized . A peculiar feature of life on Devon was that money did not exist . Sometimes the Steeds would go three years without seeing a coin , and when they did , it was apt to be of either Spanish or French origin . English pounds and shillings were incredibly scarce , a planned design on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies . As long as we control the flow of coins , ' they reasoned , we shall be in command . ' So the plantations were strangled for lack of exchange ; no Steed boy ever had a penny to spend , for there were no pennies , no place to spend them and nothing to spend them on . In self-defense the colonists invented their own specie : roanoke was universally accepted ; tobacco could be legally used to pay any debt ; and taxes were specifically levied in hogsheads of the weed . The total wealth of the Steeds , which was becoming impressive , was represented in tobacco , either in the fields , or in the drying sheds , or in hogsheads awaiting shipment , or in transit across the Atlantic , or in some warehouse in London . Slips of paper , often tattered , represented their savings . They looked to London for everything good . How precious a packet of needles was , how Martha grieved if she lost even one . Nails were like gold ; one servant did nothing all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fine products were exchanged widely throughout Virginia . Books came from London , and cloth , and utensils , and furniture , and every other thing that made a remote island tolerable . The Steeds still loved England , and when cross-ocean ships came into the creek the entire family crowded the wharf to find what good things had arrived from home , and often the letters brought tears , not from loss but from terrible homesickness . The wharf was interesting . To it and from it moved the lifeblood of the plantation , and its survival became a paramount concern . Tall cedar trees were sought , heavy at the base , tapering as they rose . These were  | cut , trimmed and hauled to the water 's edge . There heavy crossbars six feet long were nailed and lashed to a pole , whose thin end was then driven as far into the mud as the strength of two men determined . Then two additional men swung from the ends of the crossbar and worried the cedar pole into the river bottom . Finally , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand and with heavy blows of sledge hammers drove the piling home . It was to twenty-six such pilings that the wharf was attached , and it became so solid that even large ships could tie up to it with security . Learning was a constant concern . Martha taught the three boys arithmetic and Latin , knowing that no young man could be considered educated unless proficient in that splendid tongue . Edmund felt it his responsibility to teach them history and Greek , but sometimes , after working so hard in the fields , he would fall asleep as the lessons progressed , and Ralph would nudge him and he would mumble , Get on with your Greek . Do you want to be savages ? ' Each morning at five Edmund prepared himself for the day by reading books he had brought from Oxford  --  Thuycidides and Josephus in Greek , Seneca and Cicero in Latin  --  and from these authors , along with Plutarch , whom he loved , he gained insight as to how men and nations should behave . Finally there was the chapel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steeds met for prayer and the reaffirmation of their faith . They believed that God supervised their lives and marked it in their favor when they were kind to servants ; but whenever the family left this place of prayer Martha lingered at the door , looked back at the altar and thought : One day I shall be married here . The problem of Steed 's religion no longer troubled the leaders of Virginia ; he was known to be a difficult type , adhering to the faith for which his grandfather had been hanged , and certain books containing woodcuts of Sir Latimer being quartered for being a treasonous Papist circulated in the colony , but most Virginians seemed quite content to have him off to one side , across the bay and out of sight . Trouble arose in late 1633 when his son Ralph , now seventeen , felt that it was time to marry and start his own farm in the fields opposite Devon . Accordingly , he sailed down the Chesapeake , put into Jamestown , and asked permission to marry the daughter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papist , son of an avowed Catholic father and a mother specially imported from England , but others argued , and with right , that young Ralph was hardly the son of the Catholic wife but of Meg Shipton , who was as fine a Protestant as the colony provided , she being the wife of the leading factor in the region . That left Ralph only half Catholic , but that was enough to prevent a marriage . The boy was desolated by this rebuff and retired to Devon in such low  | spirits that his father and mother halted what they had been doing to counsel with him . Our family adheres to the one true faith , ' Edmund said . My grandfather died for it . My father suffered grave disqualifications . And I fled preferment in England so that I could raise my own chapel in Virginia . This is a heritage so precious that the loss of any girl , no matter how ? ' Penny 's not any girl , ' the boy countered . She 's lovely , ' Martha conceded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done about it but forget her and go back to work ? ' ' I ' 11 never forget her , ' Ralph said . Nor should you , ' Edmund said quickly , adding when his wife scowled , I mean in the sense of remembering her as a fine young lady . But she 's gone , Ralph , and you 've discovered what it means to be Catholic . ' The boy must have been tempted to shout , I do n't want to be Catholic ! ' but instead he folded his hands in his lap and lowered his head . I always intended being a good Catholic , ' he said . I think I should like to be a priest . ' Now , Ralph ! ' his mother began , but Edmund halted whatever protest she was about to make : Have you a sincere calling ? ' He proposed that they go to the chapel , and when they were inside , with bluebottles buzzing against the thick glass imported from Holland , he asked his son if he had ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke of that luminous spirit . He recalled the folklore of the subterranean Catholic movement in England , and especially of how he himself had for a brief period denied the church until that moment when he wakened near strangled with remorse . It was under such circumstances that he had decided to come to a new world where he could practice his love of God in the ways God Himself had decreed . Ralph 's parents were dedicated to the belief that only one church could represent the will of God , and for proof they cited those solemn words which sealed the matter for sensible people . Taking down the heavy Bible that Edmund had imported from England , the new one translated by the scholars of King James , they opened it to the page on which Jesus Himself launched the one true religion : And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . And I will give unto thee the keys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .  | ' It was this truth that sustained our family , ' Edmund said , just as it sustained Campion and will sustain you . ' He told Ralph that if he was experiencing a true call to the church , no summons could be more profound , and that if he wanted to become a priest , he must dedicate his life now to that high purpose . ' How ? ' the boy asked . ' In Virginia it 's impossible , ' Steed said , excited by the possibility that the Steeds of Devon might produce a priest . ' What we 'll do , Ralph , is ship you to London with Captain Hackett , and from there you must make your way to Rome and the seminary for Englishmen . ' In an ecstasy he grasped his son 's hands and suggested that all kneel and pray . ' You are treading in the path of martyrs . ' The plan proved impractical . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slave trade , announced on his next arrival at Jamestown , when Ralph was there to take passage , that he would probably never go back to England . ' I 'm heading straight for Luanda . ' ' Where 's that ? ' Edmund asked , impatient to get his son to Rome . ' Portugal . A shipping point in Africa . ' This made no sense , and Steed demanded an explanation , so Hackett spelled out the facts : ' Luanda 's a miserable town owned by Portugal in Africa . Arabians collect slaves in the jungle and drive them in chains to Luanda for easy shipment . We load the Victorious there and you have slaves here . ' But as it turned out , it was not so simple as that . He did sail directly to Luanda , and he did cram untold numbers of blacks into the fetid holds of his ship , but three days out , or perhaps four , the ship foundered and was lost , along with Hackett and all the slaves chained to the bulwarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She insisted that if God had prevented their contract with Captain Hackett , it must have been for a specific purpose , but she had barely said these words when a pinnace put into Devon Creek with startling news that would transform the history of the Steeds . The pinnace came not from Jamestown but from a point across the bay near the entrance to the Potomac River , and it carried , of all things , a Catholic priest named Father Whitson . The intelligence he brought could scarcely be comprehended . This island is no longer a part of Virginia , ' he said , his own excitement and joy jumbling his words . ' The king has ordained that a Catholic colony be established in his New World . You now belong to the Palatinate of Maryland . ' These developments were so radical that he required many minutes to unravel them . He spoke of George Calvert , Lord Baltimore , who had converted to Catholicism late in life but who had been allowed to serve King James as counselor . He had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it had perished of cold , and now King Charles , whom many suspected of being a secret Catholic , had granted him a new domain north of Virginia to be named after Queen Mary . Father Whitson had a score of other revelations to share , but before he could do so , Edmund Steed said , Father , could we repair to our chapel to hear Mass ? ' Chapel ? ' Steed led the way to the rough building , and when Father Whitson saw it he could not speak . Kneeling before the quotation from Genesis , he said a prayer ; he had been tested in the fires of Douai and Rome and had survived the mortal dangers of the surreptitious Mass in England , but this visible proof of persistent faith confounded him . When he rose he whispered , Even in the wilderness . ' After he had spread a cloth upon the altar and taken the ritual implements from their canvas bag he started the ceremony , and Edmund felt his throat choke as the noble Latin words  --  the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and in such Godgranted surroundings . Then came the sweet mysteries of the blood and body , and as the wafer touched his tongue Edmund knew that he had returned to the arms of his church . Father Whitson , looking into the faces of this kneeling family , felt a depth of emotion he had rarely experienced , even at those midnight Masses in the granges of rural England , but there was more . As he was about to pack his gear Martha Keene genuflected before him and whispered , Father , you must baptize our children , ' and when this was done , she said , Now please marry us . ' Are you not wed ? ' he asked , looking at the three sons . No , ' she said simply , not wishing to disturb him with any report of their Indian marriage . He asked therh to kneel and opened his missal to the ceremony which binds Catholics , but when he saw the words and the three sons he realized how inadequate an ordinary ritual would be in this frontier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us join on earth what You have already joined in heaven . ' And he told them , You are married . ' The next months held many perplexities for the Steeds . They had supposed , when word of a Catholic Maryland was announced , that the colonies would experience the kind of wrenching terror that had swept England whenever a change in the national religion occurred , and Edmund at least looked forward with some relish to evening scores with certain hard-headed Protestants who had caused him trouble . But the sons of Lord Baltimore , who had inherited the palatinate when their father died prematurely , were not burners or executioners . After his  | initial swing through the new colony , Father Whitson returned to lay down the law . First he handed the Steeds a printed document : Catholics in the Palatinate are warned under the severest strictures from the Proprietor that they must not conduct Masses in public nor to the offense of any other religionists . No Catholic is to speak ill of anyone adhering to another religion nor to act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or public demonstrations , or gaudy churches or anything else that may offend . Priests are not to go about in ostentatious manner , nor are they to participate in the business of government . There is to be amity throughout the Palatinate and men of all religions are welcomed , so long as they confess to the Being of God , the Immortality of his Son , Jesus Christ , and the sanctity of the Holy Spirit . Those are the rules , ' Father Whitson said , and they are to be obeyed , or the penalties will be severe . ' Is the proprietor ashamed of being Catholic ? ' Ralph asked . He seeks a peaceable palatinate , ' the priest said . And the conversion of Indians to the true faith . ' We have no contact with our Choptanks , ' Edmund said . Have many Catholics come to the other side of the bay ? ' Ralph asked . Scores . And each new ship brings others . ' Then the judges and tax men and teachers will all be Catholic ? ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made . Maryland will not be a theocracy . ' Ralph did not know this new word , but he judged that it boded ill for his religion . What 's the advantage ? ' he asked . Peace , ' Father Whitson replied , and this was not an illusory goal , even though the lavish praise sometimes bestowed upon the palatinate for its tolerance was not always warranted . Maryland did honestly encourage peace with its Indians , and as a consequence suffered fewer wars than other colonies ( but in a fit of desperation the government did arouse a crusade to annihilate the Nanticokes ) ; and it surely proclaimed religious freedom in its noble Act of Religious Toleration ( except that Jews and other heretics who denied the Trinity could be executed ) . It took a long time for the Steeds to comprehend the philosophical structure of this new concept of colonization ; they wanted a Catholic cross in the center of every settlement and a priest holding the gavel in all meetings , and it was difficult for them to believe that any system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won title to a new colony in America ; let them enjoy it . But Father Whitson , keeping a stern eye on the Eastern Shore , decreed otherwise , and cathedrals were not built . But on one point the Steeds and their priest agreed . Virginia was an
