The House of Angels A story by Ella Leffland AY 27 , 1954 ? Two minutes past midnite so it 's my wedding day , I should be getting my beauty sleep . But I have n't written any-mg down for a long time and I wo n't have ne when I 'm married , so this will be good-e . Babe 's asleep on the cot . I 've got a news-per stuck against the lamp so not to wake I keep thinking what 's going to happen him . I know he got off to a had start with his me , he came along last , number nine , and 1 , just called him Babe , like they just called Sissy , but when I was ten years old I gave ' self this name I liked , Sandra , and I asked be what name would you like ? He said nald , I do n't know where he got hold of it , I I started calling him Donald , but he said lid n't count that I 'd just call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kansas City take him along and lie could start off fresh re being Donald , but he said it would be late then . Nothing satisfies him , like if he ; awake now I know he 'd be wishing I was n't n here in my rightful room with him . We 're not alike . I 'm blond and attractive , to sound vain , where he 's puny and redded . He was the runt of the litter and he hanging onto Ma all day , even when she t down to the outhouse , and we 'd have ome and drag him away , but she did n't favor him . For one thing she was too tired to be bothered , and for another I do n't think he was our Pa 's child because the rest of us were all blond like peas in a pod , and it used to grate on her when Pa said , For a tired woman you sure get a few things done , but he did n't really care , I think he was short on brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of we kids got past the eighth grade , but I was always writing diaries and stories and things , and now I have finished up my high school diploma at nite school . I believe in self betterment , and it was me who took pity on Babe and tried to install him with my philosophy of life and call him Donald and everything , but it never took . All he really wanted to do when he was n't hanging onto Ma was to sit on this sagging old bed in the kitchen that he shared with Earl and Brother , with this old crummy blanket over his head , and daydream and pick fleas off the cat . Pa died in ' 18 and our Ma went the next year with a growth the size of a cantaloupe , it was what made her so tired . I came here to Kansas City and went to work at Woolworth 's in the hardware section , and Babe was sent to the County Home on account of being under eighteen , but he never liked the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year when he turned eighteen and I turned twenty-one he got let out in my care and I got him a room down the hall from me and got him work as a busboy in a cafeteria , but he dropped things all over and they fired him . Then I got him work as an usher in a movie house and I thought it would be wonderful because he could watch the movies , but he said he did n't like the building , and also he did n't like the candy counter girl , he said she made eyes at him . I got mad then , it was the most modern show in town with big mirrors and murals on the walls , and I also thought he should be grateful if the candy counter girl made eyes at him because god knew he was n't exactly Laurence Olivier . I tried to install him with my attitude , I told him he ought to look on the bright side and treat the candy counter girl to a terrific evening on the town but he said there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , anyway he got fired for having b.o . LL THIS TIME I was n't exactly a wallflower , but I 'm very choosy , I believe a man should have good manners . A lot of men start crack-ing their knuckles if a girl gets enthusiastic about anything but them , they can talk their heads off about sports or just hanging around some billiard room and you 're supposed to hang on every word even if you 're bored to death , and if you start to say , Well I had an interesting experience the other day , a lady came into hardware who looked exactly like Ingrid Bergman , they start cracking their knuckles . I 've passed up a lot of dates to great places because of that . My fiance has got good manners and he 's intelligent in his own way , he 's a garage mechanic , his name is Don Lemoyne , and in a few hours I 'll be Mrs. Donald R. Lemoyne . Babe has never liked Don I think because of the name , he begrudges anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don keeps telling him he ought to join the army . But I know the army would n't ever want Babe because besides not being very smart his feet are flat , I mean like a penguin 's . But Babe says he does n't want to join the army because he does n't like army buildings . What the h ? , Don says , buildings shmuildings , he thinks Babe 's crazy , he has also pointed out that Babe has taken ad-vantage of me , and I have to admit this is true . But if I do n't watch out for him , who will ? None of the other kids . I do n't even know where they are anymore except for Brother and Viola , and Brother has been in the state asylum for six years and Viola married high up and only has me over once a year when her husband 's away on business , and never Babe , Because on top of everything else Babe 's dirty , in fact it 's the worst thing of all , he never takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the real reason is that he likes dirt . I think the world is too clean for Babe , that 's why he 's so unhappy . Ma was a dirty housekeeper , it sounds mean to say but it 's true , I was glad to get away but I think Babe misses the mess . But what I was getting to.is where Don always says Babe should join the army , I always thought he should fall in love , love makes you put your best foot forward not to mention how optimistic it makes you feel . So I made Babe clean up and introduced him to a couple of my girlfriends but he never opened his mouth and when I asked him afterwards why he was so rude he just shrugged . Do n't you ever want to fall in love and get married , I asked him , and he said who cares about love ? Someday you 'll eat those words , I said , when you fall in love and you 're so filled with it you 're not fit to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wo n't happen to me , ht said , and to tell the truth I did n't really thinl it would either . I was just wishing it woulc so he would change his ways . I was getting fed up with him . On top of being dirty am a wet blanket he was out of work so mud I had to pay his rent half the time . Once wile , I mentioned this he said he would gladly fin. some other room because he did n't like building anyway , well this building , it 's no new but at least it 's clean and there are yen ( tian blinds instead of torn shades , so I sai Who are you not to like this building ? &; you ca n't talk with him , he drives me out c my mind . But the thing is I 've always felt sory for him and his hair even began to go thi last year and he 's got little wrinkles aroun his eyes already and just nineteen years oh He looks like life has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of preparir to get married and full of plans , we 're ju going to City Hall and no honeymoon 1 Don 's vacation in July , but I bought a whi suit and shoes to match , not to mention pac ing and everything because we 're moving in an apartment next week . I guess in a way thought I 'd meet somebody more up my all . but I never did in the three years I 've be . here , and Don has got a lot going for hit he 's steady on the job and is nice about thin other men might not he , like making fram for my movie star pictures out of folded cil rette packages , that 's not simple . Anywt when you 're a bride-to-be , Babe looks all 1 out and empty , a stranger would say to lo at him , What if he died , be would n't have iiv at all . But that 's the funny thing because finally did have a love affair and when it ended it nearly killed him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days , ever since it ended . I T STARTED WITH sometimes he liked to take long walks by himself and once I followed him because I was n't sure what he might be up to . He walked over to he slummy section of town but he did n't even ; tick around the normal part , he went to the Jan that was being torn down for new housng , what a horror , just rubble all over the dace like the newsreels of the Korean War , ) ut there were some buildings left standing ' ere and there . He went up to one and drank t in , it was an old rooming house with a sign hat said THE HOUSE OF ANGELS because of these two plaster of Paris angels outside an pstairs window , they had bird droppings on heir heads and they were white there but ie rest was gray and mildewy looking , and my looked loose , like they were ready to iIl down , the whole house did , it gave me ie creeps . One day after Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his rent money A. the landlady and when I came home from ork that nite he was gone with the money id he had left a note for me saying . Do n't worried , I am going to be very happy ( on-he did n't spell it like that , he ca n't spell ) . At first I was so boiling mad I did n't care here he 'd gone but after a week I got to Drry and on my day off I went to find him , id I went first thing to that Angel House . old man about ninety-five years old anrered the door stinking of beer even though was in the morning , he was dirtier than ibe ever was and with brown stumps for th and long yellow fingernails like horn . I ced for Babe and sure enough he jerked his nub up and said room nine , and I went in-le practically having to hold my nose , it gilled of damp and garbage and beer all xed up . Upstairs I knocked on Babe 's door t nobody answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crummy bed with a ile on his face . Hello Babe I said , but he n ' answer , he did n't even look surprised , e me . It was a terrible room , brown wallie hanging in tatters and linoleum on the ir with big holes in it and a dirty sink in c rner with a half naked hula doll hanging the wall next to it . I can bet Babe did n't it there , and the bed sagged in the middle ost to the floor and there were n't any , ts , just an old threadbare blanket . This the room behind the two angels and he had pulled up the window for a view of their heads and all the rubble in the distance . Babe , I said , you ran off with the rent money , how could you , you were never dishonest . I could n't help it , he said . You had a nice room and good dinners with me on my hot plate , why would you run off to this awful hole ? He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you blind or what ? I asked . He said , If you do n't like it you can go . I was surprised , he never used to have a quick tongue , and I looked him over careful . There was something funny about his face , better , I do n't know what , but his clothes were the worst ones he owned , a gray tee shirt with billions of holes and pants all ragged at the pockets , he was barefoot too and his soles were black . you pick up an extra lot of dirt with flat feet . He was going downhill fast . I told him that . I 'm not going downhill , he said and he ran his hand over that old blanket like it was silk . He said , I want you to leave me alone , I 'm happy here . Well you ca n't live here forever on that money you took , I told him . He said the rent was cheap . I should certainly hope so , I said with a bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I told him , they 're going to tear it down . He said , They wo n't tear it down . Mr. Olafson , that was the old man downstairs , told him that they would n't . All he wants is for some silly fool to pay him rent until they do , I said . Why do n't you use your head , Babe , when they put up the new housing do you think they 'll want a stinking house like this in the middle ? It 's not a stinking house , he said and he was mad . He was touchier than I ever saw him before . Well I ca n't stand it , I said , I feel dirty all over and I 'm going . Good , he said , and he went over and looked out the window like a king looking down at his gardens and goldfish ponds . I stopped at the kitchen downstairs , I wo n't even describe it , and I said , Mr. Olafson is it true what you told my brother Babe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows , sister ? he said to me , I live each day like it comes . He was punching cockroaches on the wall and saying Gotcha 1 each time , it gave me the creeps . w HEN DON CAME OVER the next nite I told him everything and asked him to go over there and try to get Babe to move out . He came back later and he said , Sandra it beats me how you who are so clean and high-minded can be related to that kid , he was sitting on the bed wrapped up in a blanket with just the moonlight coming through the window and those crazy statues outside and he jumped up and yelled For Christ 's sake who said you could come barging in here , like l 'd interrupted him in a big clinch with Rita Hayworth . I never saw him act like that , he looked like he was filled with electricity . Did you talk to him ? I asked . How could I talk to him , Don said , he run me out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the room ? He had some bread and a bread knife and he threatened me with the knife , oh I could have easy taken it away from him but I thought why bother ? I tell you , Sandra , I think we ought to sic the authorities on him . What kind of authorities , I asked . Authorities from an asylum , he said . That made me mad , but I was mad at Babe too . I let things slide for awhile then about two weeks later on my day off I went there again just to see if he had improved any or slid down further . Ai n't ( he still says ai n't you ever learned not to come barging into a room , he asked me , and when I plumped down into this crummy old chair he said , Watch how you treat that chair . Do you realize we could have the authorities cart you away , I asked him , but he paid no heed , his eyes were roaming around the room like it was the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're red , and he looked dirtier than ever but he looked gooc too , like he had filled out . I said , How corm you look like you filled out ? He said Mr. Olafson and him ate good , la said Mr. Olafson did n't make skimpy littlo salads like me and just a chop with all the I cut off , he made big pots of stew . Cat stew , I said sarcastically . Rabbit stew , he said , Mr. Olafson got rabbit hutch out back , Ugh , I said . did n't you get enough rabbi stew when we were kids ? Besides , he 's nc supposed to have rabbits inside the city limit We ai n't inside the city limits , he said , slcr like a priest , this is the house of angels big up in the sky . You 're talking crazy now , Babe , I said , I-gave me the creeps , but I have to admit I looked good when he said it . As long as I caul remember his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bh lights and I thought gosh he has nice ey after all . But I kept to my aim and I said , Look l ' ? come to install you with some sense , no dm roll your eyes and look bored , it is n't healt for you to sit here doing nothing all day this filth , how long do you think it can go of Always , he said like a lovesick goon , the was no reasoning with him . I had brought him some carrots and I nanas and a carton of cottage cheese and gave him the bag even though I was hurt what he had said about my salads and cho they are very tasty and nutritious , but did n't even open the bag and I bet he ne ? did . But I told him I was going to come evt single week til the place was torn down s bring him decent food . He said , Do n't bother , but I did , every wi on my day off I brought him fruit and ye tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five bars of soap and a towel , he never tsed any of it . Once when I came he was sound asleep so snuck down to the kitchen and got a bucket ind mop from Mr. Olafson , he said , What he h ? do you want with those , sister ? but ignored him . That mop was as dry as a bone , bet , it had n't seen use for ten years , well I died the bucket with water from Babe 's sink nd started mopping the floor when he woke p in a split second . I never saw him act the =ay he did then , he came leaping out of the ed and he grabbed that mop and tried to reak it across his knee , only he could n't , so e threw it down and yelled , Sandra never 3me back here and try to louse up my life ! nd suddenly I was glad he had fallen in love tren if it was only with a building and even it did n't make him cleaner , only dirtier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elec. icity . So I said , Honey I do n't want to louse you I want to help you but if you do n't want e to I wo n't come anymore . 1That 's fine , he said , Thank you very much mdra . It was the first time I ever heard him be Ate , will wonders never cease I asked my . If as I went out . I kept nay promise too . I never went to dt him anymore . Be lived there nearly four months on that money he did n't pay our landlady , I do n't ow what would have happened when he ran t of money but before that could happen . y tore the place down . On one of my first its I stuck my phone number on Mr. Olaf-i 's kitchen wall with a tack in case Babe s ever sick or something , and four nights Mr. Olafson called up and said they were ng to tear the house down the next morning I Babe would n't leave . got Don to drive me out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cety old car . ready to leave . He took us tairs , he told us Babe had locked the door Don is strong and he butted his shoulder inst it til it broke open . Babe was sitting the bed with his blanket around him and butcher knife Don told me about in his d . What 's this Babe , I said , you want to orn down with the building tomorrow ? , cave me alone , he said . ' ut that knife down and come with us tse , Babe , I said as sweet as I could , you stay with me tonight and I 'll set up a cot you , but he did n't even let me finish , he shouted Leave me alone again . Ion got mad and he said , Do you realize you 're upsetting your sister ? She 's getting married in a few days and she 's keyed up enough as it is . But Babe paid no heed to this , he just stuck his chin out , and then Mr. Olafson said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Listen here I do n't know why you want to stay on in this dump but you better get a move on . Babe scrambled halfway across the bed . Dump ! he yelled , how can you say that , you been here longer than me , eight years , how could you say that ? I guess it struck him odd that Mr. Olafson did n't hold the house in the same esteem he did , maybe he thought because Mr. Olafson was as dirty as he was that he looked at things the same way . But I could tell that Mr. Olafson did n't care much about anything , he just gave a shrug and walked out . I was cold standing there and there was n't even any light on , I made to turn on the light but Babe jumped up with his knife so I did n't . I whispered to Don to take the knife away but he said , Now Sandra we 've got to go careful , and he pulled up the chair for me and he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and everything was quiet and creepy . We sat there in that room all nite trying to talk sense into Babe , I was fed up with both of them , practically more with Don . Once I got so impatient I made to take away the knife myself but Babe was wild , he did n't respect it that I was his own sister and he said he 'd cut me if I took another step , then I guess Don was ashamed so he tried a couple times but only halfhearted , then he started being cautious again . What do you think you 're gaining ? he asked Babe , you 'll have to leave when the wreckers come . They wo n't come , Babe said . You 're living in a fool 's paradise , I told him , they 'll come any time now . It was getting light when I said that , my god that room looked awful in the grayness , even Babe looked gray , he was gulping in the room like a glass of wine somebody was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fed up I could have killed them both , I think the only reason I stayed all nite was because Don kept saying , Come on Sandra let 's go . HEN THE SUN WAS all red I said . Babe you 've got to come on , the wreckers will be here any minute . No they wo n't , he said , and I began to believe him because it got to be nine o'clock and ten o'clock and nothing happened , the room was bright with sunshine and all three of us looked like death and we all hated each other so much it was n't even funny . I hate to think about it but I called Don a coward and we began to yell at each other , forgetting all about Babe , and then suddenly a couple of men walked in . This place is supposed to be vacated , one of them said . Do n't we know it , I yelled , that 's my brother over there , he wo n't leave . Babe held the knife up like he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them snatched it out of his hand in a wink , it was as simple as that , I gave Don a dirty look but he was already going over to help them yank Babe off the bed . Babe turned over on his stomach and held onto the mattress and they all three went to work on him , I really hated to see it , they had to pry him off and he was yelling bloody murder all the time but finally they got hint Off and as they dragged him out of the room he kept trying to grab things along the way , the chair , the sink , the tatters on the wall . I followed them downstairs and I wondered how we 'd ever get him into the car but when we got outside he suddenly gave up like a horse that 's just been broken , he got into the car as quiet as you please and we drove away and he turned around and looked at the house til it was out of sight . I put my arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have some breakfast and you can stay with me for a few days . I accepted it that lie could n't ever be happy in a normal place , might as well let him have it his own way , so I said Listen honey we 're going to find you a nice dirty room in the slum district . He looked me right in the eye and he said It wo n't be the same . For Christ 's sake a room 's a room , Don said . You marry Sandra , Babe said , why did you choose her instead of somebody else , is anybody else the same as her ? It was the most intelligent thing I ever heard him say . But Don said , It 's not the same thing , Sandra is a person , and lie began saying very nice things about me . I admit all nite in Babe 's room I came close to breaking off with Don but now I realized I had been under a terrible strain , besides we already had the ring and the license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen shower . We got Babe up to my room and set up the cot and he fell right down on it and closed his eyes and Don took me back out to the car and he said , Sandra you ca n't take him to a room in the slum section , it would n't be a normal healthy life , he 'd fall to pieces and die young , you ca n't let him do it . Besides , there 's the rent , you know he ca n't hold a job . Well after he left I thought about it and it sounds mean to go back on my word to Babe but Don is right , so what we 're going to do is day after tomorrow take him back to the County Home , it 's only for kids under eighteen but if they ca n't take him they 'll turn him over to some other place . It sounds hard but there 's nothing else I can do , a year ago I would n't have done it but then I still had hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cot , it 's like he was dead and laid out , except he moans and groans . But yesterday I came home from work and he was gone , it scared me but pretty soon he came hack with a sack . What 's in that sack Babe , I asked but lie just shoved it under the cot , so when he was asleep I dragged it out and snuck a look . Inside was the head of one of those angels , close up the eyes were funny looking with no circle or dot on the eyeballs so that you got the feeling they were staring but you did n't know what at . I put ii back in the sack and shoved it under the bed again . I 've got to end this now , it 's four a.m. , look all fagged out at my own wedding , hu I ca n't sleep and it 's not that I 'm keyed up Don said I was keyed up enough as it is bu I 'm not , that 's the funny thing . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somebody who made me feel ( Hi ferent inside like Laurence Olivier makes m feel , but I read in a magazine that that 's it fatuation , and Don is clean and clear-heade as well as being steady on the job but I kee waiting for some big feeling . But we 've a ready got the apartment , we 're moving in ne3 iveek , it 's not too cute or anything but going to fix it up , I 've got a knack , and the as soon as we can afford it we 're going I move into a brand new tract house , noho else would ever have lived there before , 1 , old dirt to wash away , and I can see myse sitting on the front lawn with a baby , it 's n exactly exciting to work in hardware at We ( worth 's all your life , and as far as movies I they 're always happening to somebody else , want something to happen to me , somethii big that sticks me up in the clouds , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemoyne and I 'm not even keyed up . But read in that magazine that every girl sta wondering if she 's doing the right thing jr before the wedding , it 's natural . I ought stop writing now , I 'll look like something 1 cat dragged in , anyway the lamp is flickeri on and off , it 's a bad connection . Babe j woke himself up , he cries out in his sleep .
