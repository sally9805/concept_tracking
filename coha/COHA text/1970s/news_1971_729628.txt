txt America 's 90-day wage-price frees only the beginning . As Congress prepares to tackle ' Phase 2 ' of the complex Nixon program ( story below ) , its ripples continue to be felt around the world:Japan adopts a waitand-see stance toward revaluation of the yen ( Page 2 ) . Washington moves carefully  --  and selectively  --  in carrying out its 10 percent cut in foreign economic aid ( below right ) . In America 's heartland , however , the Nixon plan could reap policical hay from farmers next year ( Page 2 ) . When Congress returns Sept. 8 it will make these changes in President Nixon 's wage-price freeze program , according to present indications ? Revise Mr. Nixon 's tax proposals to give a bigger break to consumers . ? Pass major elements of the big tax package swiftly . ? Open up a great debate on costly over-seas U.S. commitments . ? Set up a wage-price review board ? Require wage-price decisions to be submitted 30 days in advance . ? Refer major disputed cases before the board to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public does not yet realize that Mr Nixon 's 90-day " freeze , " of which 10 days have already ticked off , is just the start It gives the government breathing time It gives Congress even less time . Congress returns in two weeks to one of the biggest rush jobs in history : Can it implement Mr. Nixon 's enormously complex-program in time for " Phase 2 , " starting when the 90-day freeze ends , around Nov 12 , or approximately 68 days ( 48 working days ) after Congress reassembles ? On other fronts there were these devel-opments : Hesitant Western nations allowed the dollar to slip only slightly in terms of their currencies . Mr. Nixon in effect has appealed to them to devalue the dollar by raising their currencies , but the dollar continued " strong . " Challenges fade Japan continued the remarkable feat of paying yen for dollars as though nothing has happened , acquiring 82.7 billion so far and , in effect , interposing a government shield between powerful Tokyo trading combines with which the Japanese Government traditionally cooperates and the declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . The world watched in awe . Shares on the U.S. stock market rose in the " Nixon boom market , " boosted by the prospect of tax bonanzas and price stability The Dow-Jones Industrial Average had risen from 856 Aug. 16 to 892 at the close Aug. 24 . States ' - rights challenges of the Nixon freeze by governors evaporated . Trade- union leaders grimly gathered here to consider court action . Mr Nixon waved off an appeal by the International Monetary Fund to tie the dollar back to gold . Meanwhile , it became apparent that Congress will play a big role in Phase 2 of the stability program . The public is perhaps beginning to see that some kind of economic controls are going to continue after the 90-day freeze , perhaps for a long time President Nixon began his administration by rejecting an incomes policy ( i e. , using federal authority to guide or control wages and prices ) . He has boldly reversed this position , as he has toward China . // *Congress to hone Nixonomics ' program // The nation may live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress steps in Secretary of the Ti easury John B Connally Jr says it is highly unlikely that the government will drop all economic controls when the quick-freeze thav%s Congress will ieshape them Academic economists widely ciiticize MI Nixon 's domestic tax package as lopsided in favor of business There is a prospect that Congress will change the Nixon mix . The isk is delay Example Mr Nixon by executive order Jan. 9 ( now challenged in court ) announced a controversial accelerated depreciation-tax rebate to business worth $4 billion a year The new tax package gives an additional $5 billion busines break in the form of tax credit for investments in new plant and equipment Economists Waite ' W Hellei and Charles L Schultze assail this as a " bonanZa " and recommended that perhaps half this amount go to consumers , perhaps in the form of a delay in the coming extra taxes for social security A second powerful drive is also taking form here cuts in U S military commitments over seas Heading this drive is Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield ( D ) of Montana , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar means the cost of almost 2,000 U.S bases overseas , and 500,000 troops and their dependents ( outside of Vietnam ) , will rise steeply They already cost $14 billion in the defense budget President Nixon has already promised a 10 percent cut in foreign aid on the same theory It seems certain that in the worldwide bargaining over the dollar ( in which the Nixon administration is armed with the " temporary " 10 percent surcharge tax on imports , amounting to a higher tariff ) , Germany and Japan , for example , will face the American demand for larger contributions in return for the U S nuclear shield and military support they now get .
