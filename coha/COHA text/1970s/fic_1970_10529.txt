must breakUpon the wheel of love , but not the strange , The secret lords , whom only death can change.  --  Stanley Kunitz , " Lovers Relentlessly " He and Nadia turned up the walk to their apartment building . He and Nadia would go out to dinner that night . He and Nadia could drive off any time they wanted , go anywhere : they were free . David caught himself thinking this way , " He and Nadia , " thinking about himself in the third person the way he had to think about Nadia , who was dead . She had been dead now for three months . But in his mind the sentences wound on , picking at the past and terrifying him with their hunger for the future . There was no longer any " He and Nadia could drive off any time they wanted . . . . " The fact was that while she had been alive they had not driven off like that ; who was he trying to deceive ?  |p191So  he thought clearly , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , because of that , what can no longer happen . " That evening he was on his way to an ex-student 's apartment for dinner . To a man so newly lonely , so newly alone , an invita-t on out meant an evening in other people 's lives , and therefore freedom from his own , and it meant the possibility of laughter that would surprise him  --  how good it was to be alive and healthy , to have a body that had not given up in spite of everything . When he was with other people he realized that he had clot really died along with Nadia after all . The strange thing was that he hated to be invited out . He hatted to play the game again , as one hates and fears returning to a childhood game that was once so easy . It was almost too much effort for him to show that he was alive when every cell in his body ached to die and have it over with . But he never turned down any invitations . He never said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distracted , who would agree to anything ; and what if he wanted to join the game again someday and he had no way to get in ? He had parked his car down the block and was now walking quickly to his ex-student 's apartment building . As he walked he listened to the curious lonely sound of his footsteps , a sound he had truly never heard before Nadia died , and he duelled the panic that rose in him by saying , " The hell with it . The hell with it , " telling himself that he could stand anything , now that he had stood so much , that he could get through these few hours with a former student without breaking down . The apartment building was shabby , and he felt his suit sympathize with the building and grow limp , wrinkled . Yes , he was shabby , he was tired . Why hide it ? Everyone who saw him said , " that 's the one whose wife killed herself , " and made a moist clickingsound with their mouths ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young couple on their way out for Saturday night held the door open for him and he mumbled thanks andp192ducked inside . He probably looked as if he lived here . All his life David had melted into landscapes , just as Nadia had stood out from them . Seen in the foyer of the expensive apartment house where he lived , he looked as if he belonged there ; seen in one of ' the sleazy campus taverns , he looked as if he belonged there too . Nadia had had the gift of eliminating all backgrounds . It had not been her face , exactly , that angular , striking , nervous face that always drew one 's eye back to it , and not her long slender body that looked always about to move on , to shift about restlessly . . . but something in her manner , some indefinable impatienceor intolerance in her voice . She blotted out landscapes and other people , and she was beginning to blot out , for David , all of the life he had led up to the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cracked sidewalk , and at its feeble peak was the top of his life : those several minutes when they had explained to him that she was dead . Then time led downward again , the same modest cracked sidewalk . In the foyer he pressed the buzzer by Jerry Randolph 's name and was answered at once by another buzzer , which unlocked the inner door . All this caution , David thought , in a neighborhood like this ? Why would anyone want to break in here ? The buzzinghad made him nervous and he tried to force the heavy door shut behind him , but it was closing slowly of its own accord and could not be hurried . He was standing there , no longer pushing at it and not quite on his way again , when he heard : " Dr. Hutter ? Hello . " Jerry stood on the landing , smiling nervously . " Hello , " David said . They both smiled . There was the awkward business of gettingup the stairs with Jerry watching , but then they were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live down here , " Jerry said . They walked along briskly . The corridor was gray and made David feel nearsighted : something vague and fuzzy about the way it was lighted . " We were lucky to get in here , so near school . . . . Someone said he was moving out . . . . " David nodded to allp193this , not really hearing it . He wished suddenly that he had stayed home . He wished that he had stayed safe in his own apartment , wearing out the hours until bedtime without bothering to turn on the lights , just sitting there in the living room that faced the park . . . . But Jerry was talking and David turned to him guiltily . I le had always liked the boy and he forced himself to remember this . " My wife Betty  --  " This was a surprise : a wife . " Very pleased to meet you , " he heard his voice say . She colored pleasantly , a pretty girl , ordinary and pretty and very young , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him inside the apartment . They chattered together about the room , about Jerry 's books and records , he had so many of them , and David gave the impression of listening . If he could get to the moment at which they offered him a drink he would be all right . Jerry indicated the best chair . He sat . The little girl asked him about drinks and he said , " Yes , anything , " and she disappeared . Good . Jerry sat and there was a moment of silence . But fortunatelya record was playing and they listened to it carefully . " Ah , Ives , " David said . " Is n't he wonderful ? " said Jerry . David could let the music answer for him . He sat back and relaxed . But he was such a fake these days , after Nadia had left him for the last time , that even his relaxing was just pretense . He had forgotten how to relax. " . . . eight more credit hours to go . It does n't seem possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plans for next year . The boy talked and now David had that drink . He smiled up at the girl , what-was-her-name , and accepted it . Because he needed it so much , he forced himself to sit and hear out one of Jerry 's sentences to the end . Finally he said , " Here 's to your new apartment . It 's very nice . " They all drank . The girl smiled and then her smile weakened ,  |p194became  qualified . A tremor in his stomach told David when other people were thinking about Nadia ; he looked away . " What sort of work are you doing this semester ? " he asked Jerry . Jerry sat forward ; he could talk for hours . He jumped from topic to topic as he had in class , his conversation a kind of free association of ideas and impressions , like the radical poetry publishedin the students ' literary magazine . The girl was a little embarrassed . David caught something restless in her  --  she was blond and tanned , not the type David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , with a heavy gold bracelet weighing down one wrist . Too good for Jerry . Better background . In a minute Jerry would shift to the University and the class it represented , which had not been his class : his father had been unemployed for years and he , Jerry , was just now finishing up college though he was twenty-six. " . . , the trustees and the Establishment are identical , " Jerry was saying . They talked and the girl listened , fascinated by both husband and professor . When she excused herself and went out into the kitchen , David said , " Very lovely girl . " The " very " made it sound insincere and this surprised him , since he had meant it . " Yes , " Jerry said , embarrassed . " She 's the one I . . . I mentionedto you a few times . We finally got married in October . I 'm afraid I was always bothering you , saying the most self-centered , self-conscious crap , wasting your time . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely . " Your advice meant a lot to me . I might not have made it through school without it . " David took a drink , startled . He did not want anything frank or personal said to him this evening . He wanted nothing more than to play the game and hide behind drinks and dinner and ordinary , tedious conversation . Jesus Christ , he thought , does he mean it ? He tried to think of what he could have said to this boy ,  |p195while  he himself had been carrying around with him daily the five-hundred-pound burden of a disintegrating marriage , a disintegratingwife . . . . But Jerry was sensitive enough to switch onto another topic , racial discrimination at the University , which was so familiar that anyone could talk knowledgeably about it . And so on until dinner . They ate in the kitchen , but the overhead light had been turned off and there were candles on the table . David was touched by how hard the little girl was trying . " More of this sauce ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraction and he was able to relax a little . He wondered if it was true , what someone had said  --  that he looked tired , did n't he need a rest ? A wave of self-pity swept upon him and he wanted to say , Yes , yes , I am tired , I am tired to death , someone please help me . But when he did speak his voice was as meaningless as the twang of a piece of metal . " . . . What do you think about that new law ? Stopping and frisking men on the street ? " David tried to think what this was . He no longer read the newspapers ; he had just forgotten about them . " Is it constitutional ? " he said . This must have been a good answer , since it got Jerry going . He jiggled the table in his excitement , while David pushed food around on his plate . The girl said , " Oh , honey , " and David was able to glance at his watch . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Negro woman , and how she had tried to cut her wrists in her cell . The girl said again , in a sharp surprised voice , " Honey . " And all conversation stopped . David kept on eating . He wanted to explain that it was all right . They need not be concerned . Please talk again . Talk . He ate to show them how composed he was after three months ; he was not still thinking of his wife , who had taken every pill in the medicine cabinet , like a child playing a game , flooding her arterieswith poisons that must have warred even on one another.  | " Do you know Shapero 's quartet ? I want to play it for you , " Jerry said , and when he got up he jiggled the table . The girl steadied it and tried to smile at David , but her smile was unconvincing . From the other room Jerry called in : " Wait till you hear the precision in this  --  it 's stunning . " " Do you like music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David thought . Not any more . But he said yes , because only those who are ugly and cruel and are never invited anywhere admit they do n't think about music at all  --  liking it or not liking it . They listened to the record . They had dessert . David thought , eating , that food was a reality he had almost forgotten about . It was real . Music and talk floated around and got lost , the hell with them , but food was real and proved to him that he was alive . There was always more of it . Music and talk and even people could get lost , but food never . Jerry got up and played the record again . They listened . The girl pretended to listen and her frown of concentration seemed to David lovely . After dinner she remained out in the kitchen and he and Jerry sat together , man to man . Jerry said , with the plodding sincerity that had always made David like him , " I was sure sorry to hear about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . . . . " But if he had known Nadia he would have believed it at once . " . . . all the kids . . . I remember that one class , when you talked about Keats . . . . " The class materialized in David 's imagination , that roomful of faces he had never realized cared so much about him , were so sympathetic , so nosy . The girl returned , smiling shyly , and Jerry brought that conversation to an undignified halt . He was abrupt , graceless . The little girl stared down at her feet  --  patent leather shoes , very pretty  --  and David wanted to take their hands and bring them together , introduce them to each other and leave , get out . What place had he , a forty-year-old wreck still careening along with the force of forty years ' momen/turn , in this crowded happy little apartment ? Tonight the girl would huddle in Jerry 's arms and maybe even manage to weep , a few tears not for David but for the tragedy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now they were talking about politics , and David could at least handle his side of the conversation . He felt aged , weary , a tennis player trapped in a game with someone twenty years younger , lunging to get shots no one expected him to get . He drank . Jerry drank and the little girl sat on the floor , her feet tucked primly under her skirt . This was the real thing , this kind of talk . Her eyes shone . She had heard so much about Dr. Hutter , the intellectualDr . Hutter , and now David could not let her down . He had to perform , weary as he was . Every cell in his body ached but he kept on with the game . " It really meant a lot  --  you coming here tonight , " Jerry said . " Betty thought we maybe should n't bother you , but  --  " Jerry chattered on without noticing his wife 's sharp , warning look . He had a thin , earnest , eager face , this boy who was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore forcing men like David on into middle age before they were ready for it . David felt a stab of sorrow to think that he was not equal to the boy 's admiration . He was not equal to anyone 's admiration . He wanted to explain this to them but his brain was clouded from the alcoholand the strain of keeping up talk , keeping his face sane and orderly . Jerry faltered , embarrassed and happy in that way only students can be happy , and his wife listened with a small worried smile , hoping he would not make another blunder . Then it was time to leave . He would be carried along by the current of talk , right out the door and down the corridor into safety . Standing , they talked a little more easily than before . He had stayed late enough . The warm air of the room seemed to push drunkenly at him , pressing against his chest , and he felt as if he were on the brink of something terrible . " I should  --  maybe I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go on . He stared past them and was silent . Then the chorus of farewells again , and the open door , and the hall that made him feel nearsighted ; and at last the night air . Outside , he knew what he had wanted to tell them . It came to him suddenly , like a blow . They had to know  --  they should n't be fooled  --  that he was not mourning Nadia 's death , but his own . He hated her for the selfishness of her death and for her having eclipsed him forever , obliterated him as if she had smashed an insect under her shoe . He would always be pointed out as the man whose wife had killed herself . That would be the only interestingfact about him , and how could he ever rise above it by anything in his own life ? " Like a slug . A filthy slug , " he said aloud . His dead wife was a slug that had trailed its slime across the whiteness of his life , and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried little girl . For a moment he thought about going back to tell them , running back and pounding on the door . " I want you to know the truth ! The truth ! " Then he recovered and went on home . Three months before , on the day before Nadia died , they had been driving out to her mother 's house . It was a Sunday and that day remained in David 's mind always blank , blurred , pale , the sky not blue but not white either , overcast by a veil of haze . She was driving and he did n't like the way she passed everyone , as if she really wanted to get where they were going . But she said , " I can handle the car . I 'm fine . " She wore a black and white checked coat , of a simple and expensive cut , like all her clothes . When David came home and found another of those packages on their bed , the long rectangular cardboard box with flimsy paperp199inside or lying half-crumpled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helplessness . The new suit or new dress would be in the closet and he could never tell which one it was , but the box was left out , accidentally , carelessly , as if she had forgotten about how he felt when her mother gave her money . She would say , her eyes large and restless in their deep sockets , " My mother wants to do it , why should I refuse her ? " She swung out into the left lane , preparing to pass another car . David said , " You should have let me drive . " She said at once , " Do n't talk to me like that . Do n't make me angry . " The car gatheredpower and rushed forward , leaving the other car behind . David lit a cigarette and saw how absurdly it trembled in his fingers . " You keep at me all the time , " she said . " All right . " " You never let me alone . " From the side , Nadia 's face looked slender and anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her , words were just sounds to thrust out at David or at anyone  --  even her doctor , who had finally contacted David to ask his cooperation  --  to keep them at a distance , to distract them . She did not really listen to what she said and so it was a surprise when she remembered odd , stray little remarks of his , years old . She would smile at him with her dreamy calculating smile and recall observations he had made , years ago when he had been another person . It was the same power she had in her face , something he could not imagine until he experienced it , again and again : the power to turn her gaze upon him and excite him so that he felt shaken and helpless , as innocent as he had been when they had first met . " Because of the way we came together , you can never respect me , " she was saying . Their arguments made his head ache because he always gave in and , in giving in , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already thinking of something else.  | " Look , please , " he said . " It 's a lovely day . It 's Sunday . Why do n't you relax ? " " In every car on this highway someone is telling someone else to relax , " Nadia muttered . " What are you going to say to my mother ? About my going to Toronto ? " " Nothing . " Nadia glanced at him . " Were you really so worried ? " He did not answer . His head was aching . " David , look , " she said . " I know how you feel . I know . But what about me ? I keep thinking of going away , of going to strange places . . . ca n't you understand that ? You 've never tried to understand it . I think of dirty old buses , I think of walking , hitching rides . . . if you woke up one morning and ran outside and ran away from your life , would n't you come into a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away a day earlier , would n't you have gone to a different life still , a different world ? When people know this , how can they stay in one place ? " " Nadia , we do n't want to talk about this again . Not now . " " But you stay where you are and you 're so permanent , " she said , " you seem to me heavy and strange , like a statue . I can feel you behind me when I leave , I circle around you and feel you there , I do n't know what happens . . . . He told me to call this Dr. Hack , but I 'm not going to . I know very well what Dr. HackIs . " We 'll can him tomorrow . " " Everyone is like me ! They want to have other lives , be other people . Do n't tell me . If I have to be just one person I 'll kill myself  --  " " Do n't talk like that , Nadia . Please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned and he saw sharp lines on her forehead , between her eyes . In a few years she would look like a witch , he thought . He was unmoved . The love he felt for this woman was a condition he existed in , the way he existed in a world of gases only accidentally fit to breathe . He neededp201this love for survival the way he needed air , but it would never have occurred to him to be grateful for it or to feel any affection for Nadia , beneath the surface of his passion . And what a famous passion it must be , he thought  --  married now for six years and still hollow-eyed with being so alert , with having to see in every stranger an object for Nadia 's meticulous and always serious concern . Right now it was a child on a bicycle , coming toward them . She rode on the muddy shoulder of the highway , a girl of about twelve . Hands firm on the handlebars , on red plastic guards that were probably soiled , body leaning forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white socks . " Wonder where she 's going in such a hurry , " Nadia said . He saw her take the time to glance into the rear-view mirror , and he was bitter with jealousy . It was like a taste in his mouth . Her imagination sailed off backward with the child , to what ugly little farmhouse crouched on the edge of this highway , stunned by the road getting so wide and so busy over the years , to what drudge of a mother and what father resting all day from a week in the factory , now that these small old farms were no longer worked . . . ? " I used to love riding a bicycle , " Nadia said softly . " We could get two bicycles . Keep them in the garage . " " I 'm too old for it now ... " " Everyone rides bicycles in the park . Grandfathers . Grand-mothers . " " It would n't be the same thing , " she said . It was never the " same thing " with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same thing ? She was a woman who had abandoned her own life , her own body , and David felt shackled to a corpse . She disappeared sometimes and when she returned to him , haggard and wistful , he always took her in . She had done nothingwrong , even when there had been other men involved , atp202least nothing that should not have been done ; and if she stayed home for his sake in the apartment she had wanted so badly , she could sit for four , five hours at a time in the bedroom , staring out at the park . The building was expensive because its hundred or so inhabitants could stare out their windows at the jumble of leaves and branches that was the park , but there was a terror to the silence of trees that could never be imagined by one living an ordinary noisy life . He said to her , Call that girl you used to see , what's-her-name , and go shopping . Have lunch . He said , Why do n't we have someone over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets to plays and concerts , wooing her , luring her out , but he got no happiness from her icy , beautiful face if that drugged look was in it . Neutral to the touch as wax , neither cold nor warm , having neither softness nor hardness  --  her skin lay on the outermost limits of her body , and that was all . If she did not run away on an impulse to Chicago or Toronto , she could be just as far away lying beside him at night . She said , " I keep wanting to go away but I need you here . I need you back here , waiting . " " Do you think that 's healthy ? Normal ? " " I do n't know what that means , normal , " she had said slowly . He thought that if they went out driving more , went on suddentrips of their own , she would give in to him and become his wife . A wife was a kind of possession and no husband thought that way until something went wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to possess , you had to be able to depend upon . He tried to explain this to her . But his love was the anchor that held her down and kept her safe , no matter how far away she went . Without him , she would have had no one to encircle and she would have kept going forever in one direction , lost . Now she let her head fall back a little , in a girlish indication of surprise . And chagrin . She said , " David , I do n't think this is the right Sunday . " " What ? " " I do n't think she meant today . She meant next week . "  | " Are you sure ? " David said . " I think so . . . . Is n't this silly ? " If she questioned anything , David lost his capacity to be certainabout it . She might have doubted his own past , the years before she came into his life , and he would have had to struggle to retain it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not very anxious to keep going . " " I know . " " I like your mother , but . . . . " " Mothers are all the same . Mothers , fathers , " she said . " I hate your family and you hate mine , no , do n't interrupt , I 'm not complaining . Everyone knows these things . Well , what should we do ? " " What do you want to do ? Keep on driving ? " " Please do n't make fun of me . " " I was n't . I 'm just trying to understand you . " Nadia laughed . " But you 're the one who 's strange ! How anyonecan stay in one place , one room , for five years the way you did , the same job , the same life . . . . What should we do now ? " " We can turn around and go back home . " " But maybe it was today ? I ca n't remember , " she said . " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Why does she bother me , why ca n't she leave me alone ? " she said angrily . " I have you now and I do n't need her . I wish she could understand that . " " What did you mean just now ? " " What ? " " Not being able to understand me  --  " " Christ , this car is hot , " she said . The sun had broken through the haze . Nadia rolled down the window and the air blasted against her face , whipping her short dark hair back . " I ca n't stand driving , I hate being so hot and sweaty . Tell me what you want to do or I 'll drive off the road . I 'll turn the car into that field . " " Just slow down , " he said . He spoke carefully , though his headp204was pounding with pain . " It 's all right , Nadia . You can park on the edge . " She let the car roll to a stop . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windshield . " You do n't want me to go anywhere again , so why should I ? I 'll stay in one place forever , " she said . She snatched the keys out of the ignition and threw them out the window . They landed on the far side of the highway , with a thin metallic ting . " It 's all right , Nadia . " " Nothing 's all right . " ' We can just sit here and relax for a minute . " She was breathing hard . Always , confronted with the real woman and not just with the memory of her , David felt how inadequate he was  --  how little he knew , how little power he had . She was like a rich , complex gift bestowed upon him , one he had received without earning and so could not enjoy . " Please do n't leave me again , " he said . He took both her hands and turned her to him , he pressed her cold hands against his face . They sat like this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , If I look up at her and she looks at me in that certain way , it will mean something . He looked up and her eyes , in their dark , strained sockets , were fixed on him . She smiled hesitantly . " Here we are , in this one life , " she said . A surge of love for her rose within him . He loved her and he was not going to let her go . For six years he had been strong enough always to draw her back , and he would be able to save her . Why not ? Sunlight flooded the car and pounded on the side of his face , like the strength that coursed through his body and gave him such power.  |p205About  seven years before that day , in early October , David had been in his old room a few blocks from the University , waiting . He had waited part of a Monday and all day Tuesday , stepping out now and then onto the top of his landlady 's back porch , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented the second floor . It looked out and down to a nondescript back yard , mainly crab grass and dandelions , and finally to a board fence ; behind that a few yards was a railroad track , on a raised column of ground . He would have to go out the next day , but Tuesday he could stay home , waiting for her , and at the thought of her coming to him he felt his heart pound violently . He was like a machine or a complicated toy whose parts have begun to speed up inside . In the medicine-cabinet mirror his face looked the same , his skin a little pale but cool , almost clammy . He had the look of a man who is waiting . Every hour he turned up the radio volume and listened to the news . Listening to the news was like sliding downhill . At first there was confusion and pain , then you got numb , then you were at the bottom and could not remember how bad it had been . He listened , sweating , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba , and then to details of crisis in Washington , and finally to items about little children whose dogs had been found after two weeks , or children whose cats had been rescued from trees by the Fire Department . Then he turned down the volume again . He went out on his makeshift balcony and leaned on the railing , looking out into the rich golden air of early autumn and sometimesnot even thinking about Nadia , not even thinking her name . She did finally come , that evening . She had been breathless ,  |p206with  her long hair disheveled about her face . David stared at her hungrily to see what she was bringing him : and she looked back at him and smiled . It was all right . He drew her into the room and closed the door and they stood looking at each other , afraid to let their excitement show . She said , " We 've been talking about it for two days nearly . All last night and today . I told him how I felt and he understands , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , those languid bluish lids , in an adolescent expression of relief . " Here , sit down , " David said . They were furtive and bumbling , like children playing at being adults . " I bought this to celebrate . In case there was something to celebrate . " " Did you think I might not come ? " she said shyly . It took him a while to get the cork out and his face flushed . She laughed with him , her own cheeks hectic and red . When she held up her glass for him to fill , he noticed how it trembled in her fingers . " No , I knew you 'd come , " he said . Even now , awkward as she was , this young girl knew the secretrhythm that women have for moments of intimacy ; she was awkward but not embarrassed . She sat back with a gesture of exhaustionthat was only pretense , childish pretense , and smiled at him over the rim of the glass , a lovely dazzling smile that meant she had come a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My God , my God , " she whispered . There was so much to say , so much to ask , that David could not begin . He sat smiling as if enchanted , staring into a light that was radiant but blinding . She had first appeared to him as an indifferently ordinary body , a girl in the company of other people . He could not truly say when he had first seen her , but she remembered her first impressionof him because of course he was someone special ; even the least of professors is a public personality . All this was teasing , droll , but something in him hungered for it : her heavy antique bracelets , her old-fashioned sapphire ring , and that air she had atp207all times  --  even when sloppily dressed  --  of belonging strangely to both the present and a personal , private past . She was not a collegestudent but instead the wife of a young instructor , and she explained rapidly and defensively that she had not graduated from college , no , she had dropped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if only now did she recall why she had dropped out , and the recollection was unpleasant . " What I want is to get out of here . This city . I want to go back home , where my mother is , " Nadia would say , gently and persistently , so that anyone who heard her knew she was demanding something . Of her husband she said little . " It was a mistake . I was too young . He 'll be happy to stay here forever . And he listens to the opera on the radio , any opera , all day Sunday . " She spoke in a rapid , clipped voice , flushed at her vulgarity but really not caring , carrying it all off whimsically and brusquely . She had decided to take a night course , not for credit , and so she had walked into David 's life , idle and always perfectly dressed , with an odor or look about her of clear , sun-drenched days at the shore and a dark , studious gaze of utter frankness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long legs look even longer and more slender than they were , and made her shoulders arch slightly and the curve at the base of her spine show as if she were sucking in her breath . Her hair was loose on her shoulders and it did not make her look casual so much as it made her look impatient , restless . And so she had run up his stairs and into his room , this elaboratelyfurnished and cluttered room he had had for years all to himself , and changed both their lives . In his arms she was like treasure scooped up and flung upon him by the sea , overwhelminghim , sweeping him along with its fragrant odor and its rich , heavy , entwining embrace , something that looked and felt soft but was strangely ornamental , even glittering . No one else existedin the world except them . There was no one . David woke to hear a vague sputtering , some static : just the radio over on his desk . Its dial showed in the dark , a dim orange ,  |p208but  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something sleepily , and he answered , telling her nothing but giving her all she wanted  --  the sound of his voice . The moment was sealed within itself , David thought , and nothing could change it , as if he and this girl were on an island together , able to read in each other 's eyes the opaque secret of life  --  huddling together , embracing , loving , thwarted only at having at last to come apart and be two people again . All of the world must be straining against his windowsto get a glimpse at them , he thought fiercely ; all of the world must be sick with jealousy to know that it could never have what they possessed together.  |p209Four  SummersIt is some kind of special day . " Where 's Sissie ? " Ma says . Her face gets sharp , she is frightened . When I run around her chair she laughs and hugs me . She is pretty when she laughs . Her hair is long and pretty . We are sitting at the best table of all , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air smells nice . Daddy is coming back from the building with some glasses of beer , held in his arms . He makes a grunting noise when he sits down . " Is the lake deep ? " I ask them . They do n't hear me , they 're talking . A woman and a man are sitting with us . The man marched in the parade we saw just awhile ago ; he is a volunteer fireman and is wearing a uniform.  |p210Now  his shirt is pulled open because it is hot . I can see the dark curly hair way up by his throat ; it looks hot and prickly . A man in a soldier 's uniform comes over to us . They are all friends , but I ca n't remember him . We used to live around here , Ma told me , and then we moved away . The men are laughing . The man in the uniform leans back against the railing , laughing , and I am afraid it will break and he will fall into the water . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Jerry . He and Frank keep running back and forth . I do n't want to go with them , I want to stay by Ma . She smells nice . Frank 's face is dirty with sweat . " Dad , " he says , whining , " ca n't we go out in a boat ? Them kids are going out . " A big lake is behind the building and the open part where we are sitting . Some people are rowing on it . This tavern is noisy and everyone is laughing ; it is too noisy for Dad to think about what Frank said . " Harry , " says Ma , " the kids want a boat ride . Why do n't you leave off drinking and take them ? " " What ? " says Dad . He looks up from laughing with the men . His face is damp with sweat and he is happy . " Yeah , sure , in a few minutes . Go over there and play and I 'll take you out in a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I run after them . I have a bag of potato chips . An old man with a white hat pulled down over his forehead is sitting by the boats , smoking . " You kids be careful , " he says . Frank is leaning over and looking at one of the boats . " This here is the best one , " he says . " Why 's this one got water in it ? " says Jerry . " You kids watch out . Where 's your father ? " the man says . " He 's gon na take us for a ride , " says Frank . " Where is he ? " The boys run along , looking at the boats that are tied up . They do n't bother with me . The boats are all painted dark green , butp211the paint is peeling off some of them in little pieces . There is water inside some of them . We watch two people come in , a man and a woman . The woman is giggling . She has on a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . " What 's all this filthy stuff by the shore ? " she says . There is some scum in the water . It is colored a light brown , and there are little seeds and twigs and leaves in it . The man helps the woman out of the boat . They laugh together . Around their rowboat little waves are still moving ; they make a churning noise that I like . " Where 's Dad ? " Frank says . " He ai n't coming , " says Jerry . They are tossing pebbles out into the water . Frank throws his sideways , twisting his body . He is ten and very big . " I bet he ai n't coming , " Jerry says , wiping his nose with the back of his hand . After awhile we go back to the table . Behind the table is the white railing , and then the water , and then the bank curves out so that the weeping willow trees droop over the water . More men in uniforms , from the parade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ca n't we go out ? Ca n't we ? There 's a real nice boat there  --  " " For Christ 's sake , get them off me , " Dad says . He is angry with Ma . " Why do n't you take them out ? " " Honey , I ca n't row . " " Should we take out a boat , us two ? " the other woman says . She has very short , wet-looking hair . It is curled in tiny little curls close to her head and is very bright . " We 'll show them , Lenore . Come on , let 's give your kids a ride . Show these guys how strong we are . " " That 's all you need , to sink a boat , " her husband says . They all laugh . The table is filled with brown beer bottles and wrappers of things . I can feel how happy they all are together , drawn together by the round table . I lean against Ma 's warm leg and she pats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell even before she says something that she is going to be loud . " You guys 're just jealous ! Afraid we 'll meet some soldiers ! " she says . " Ca n't we go out , Dad ? Please ? " Frank says . " We wo n't fight .... " " Go and play over there . What 're those kids doing  --  over there ? " Dad says , frowning . His face is damp and loose , the way it is sometimes when he drinks . " In a little while , okay ? Ask your mother . " " She ca n't do it , " Frank says . " They 're just jealous , " Ma says to the other woman , giggling . " They 're afraid we might meet somebody somewhere . " " Just who 's gon na meet this one here ? " the other man says , nodding with his head at his wife . Frank and Jerry walk away . I stay by Ma . My eyes burn and I want to sleep , but they wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still daylight . When we go home from places like this it is always dark and getting chilly and the grass by our house is wet . " Duane Dorsey 's in jail , " Dad says . " You guys heard about that ? " " Duane ? Yeah , really ? " " It was in the newspaper . His mother-in-law or somebody called the police , he was breaking windows in her house . " " That Duane was always a nut ! " " Is he out now , or what ? " " I do n't know , I do n't see him these days . We had a fight , " Dad says . The woman with the short hair looks at me . " She 's a real cute little thing , " she says , stretching her mouth . " She drink beer , Le-nore ? " " I do n't know . " " Want some of mine ? " She leans toward me and holds the glass by my mouth . I canp213smell the beer and the warm stale smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , what the hell are you doing ? " her husband says . When he talks rough like that I remember him : we were with him once before . " Are you swearing at me ? " the woman says . " Leave off the kid , you want to make her a drunk like your-self ? " " It do n't hurt , one little sip .... " " It 's okay , " Ma says . She puts her arm around my shoulders and pulls me closer to the table . " Let 's play cards . Who wants to ? " Dad says . " Sissie wants a little sip , do n't you ? " the woman says . She is smiling at me and I can see that her teeth are darkish , not nice like Ma 's . " Sure , go ahead , " says Ma . " I said leave off that , Sue , for Christ 's sake , " the man says . He jerks the table . He is a big man with a thick neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond , lighter than his hair , and are thick and tufted . Dad is staring at something out on the lake without seeing it . " Harry , look , my goddam wife is trying to make your kid drink beer . " " Who 's getting hurt ? " Ma says angrily . Pa looks at me all at once and smiles . " Do you want it , baby ? " I have to say yes . The woman grins and holds the glass down to me , and it clicks against my teeth . They laugh . I stop swallowingright away because it is ugly , and some of the beer drips down on me . " Honey , you 're so clumsy , " Ma says , wiping me with a napkin . " She 's a real cute girl , " the woman says , sitting back in her chair . " I wish I had a nice little girl like that . " " Lay off of that , " says her husband . " Hey , did you bring any cards ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . "  | " Look , I 'm sick of cards , " Ma says . " Yeah , why do n't we all go for a boat ride ? " says the woman . " Be real nice , something new . Every time we get together we play cards . How 's about a boat ride ? " " It better be a big boat , with you in it , " her husband says . He is pleased when everyone laughs , even the woman . The soldier lights a cigarette and laughs . " How come your cousin here 's so skinny and you 're so fat ? " " She is n't fat , " says Ma . " What the hell do you want ? Look at yourself . " " Yes , the best days of my life are behind me , " the man says . He wipes his face and then presses a beer bottle against it . " Harry , you 're lucky you moved out . It 's all going downhill , back in the neighborhood . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , " the woman says . Her face is blotched now , some parts pale and some red . " Harry do n't sit out in his back yard all weekend drinking . He gets something done . " " Harry 's younger than me . " Ma reaches over and touches Dad 's arm . " Harry , why do n't you take the kids out ? Before it gets dark . " Dad lifts his glass and finishes his beer . ' Who else wants more ? " he says . " I 'll get them , you went last time , " the soldier says . " Get a chair for yourself , " says Dad . " We can play poker . " " I do n't want to play poker , I want to play rummy , " the woman says . " At church this morning Father Reilly was real mad , " says Ma . " He said some kids or somebody was out in the cemetery and left some beer bottles . Is n't that awful ? " " Duane Dorsey used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winking . " Hey , who 's that over there ? "  | " You mean that fat guy ? " " Is n't that the guy at the lumberyard that owes all that money ? " Dad turns around . His chair wobbles and he almost falls ; he is angry . " This goddamn place is too crowded , " he says . " This is a real nice place , " the woman says . She is taking something out of her purse . " I always liked it , did n't you , Lenore ? " " Sue and me used to come here a lot , " says Ma . " And not just with you two , either . " " Yeah , we 're real jealous , " the man says . " You should be , " says the woman . The soldier comes back . Now I can see that he is really a boy . He runs to the table with the beer before he drops anything . He laughs . " Jimmy , your ma would n't like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she ai n't here . " " Are they still living out in the country ? " Ma says to the woman . " Sure . No electricity , no running water , no bathroom  --  same old thing . What can you do with people like that ? " " She always talks about going back to the Old Country , " thesoldier says . " Thinks she can save up money and go back . " " Poor old bastards do n't know there was a war , " Dad says . Helooks as if something tasted bad in his mouth . " My old man diedthinking he could go back in a year or two . Stupid old bastards ! " " Your father was real nice . . . . " Ma says . " Yeah , real nice , " says Dad . " Better off dead . " Everybody is quiet . " June Dieter 's mother 's got the same thing , " the woman says in a low voice to Ma . " She 's had it a year now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big she used to be . "  | " She was big , all right , " Ma says . " Remember how she ran after June and slapped her ? We were there  --  some guys were driving us home . " " Yeah . So she 's got it too . " " Hey , " says Dad , " why do n't you get a chair , Jimmy ? Sit down here . " The soldier looks around . His face is raw in spots , broken out . But his eyes are nice . He never looks at me . " Get a chair from that table , " Dad says . " Those people might want it . " " Hell , just take it . Nobody 's sitting on it . " They might  --  " Dad reaches around and yanks the chair over . The people look at him but do n't say anything . Dad is breathing hard . " Here , sit here , " he says . The soldier sits down . Frank and Jerry come back . They stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Frank says . " What ? " " Out for a boat ride . " " What ? No , next week . Do it next week . We 're going to play cards . " " You said  --  " " Shut up , we 'll do it next week . " Dad looks up and shades his eyes . " The lake do n't look right anyway . " " Lot 's of people are out there  --  " " I said shut up . " " Honey , " Ma whispers , " let him alone . Go and play by your-selves . " " Can we sit in the car ? " " Okay , but do n't honk the horn . " " Ma , ca n't we go for a ride ? " " Go and play by yourselves , stop bothering us , " she says . " Hey , will you take Sissie ? " They look at me . They do n't like me , I can see it , but they takep217me with them . We run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us . " Oops , got to watch it ! " Frank giggles . We run along the walk by the boat . A woman in a yellow dress is carrying a baby . She looks at us like she does n't like us . Down at the far end some kids are standing together . " Hey , lookit that , " Frank says . A blackbird is caught in the scum , by one of the boats . It ca n't ) fly up . One of the kids , a long-legged girl in a dirty dress , is pokingat it with a stick . The bird 's wings keep fluttering but it ca n't get out . If it could get free it would fly and be safe , but the scum holds it down . One of the kids throws a stone at it . " Stupid old goddamn bird , " somebody says . Frank throws a stone . They are all throwingstones . The bird does n't know enough to turn away . Its feathers are all wet and dirty . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Frank says , throwing a rock . The water splashes up and some of the girls scream . I watch them throwing stones . I am standing at the side . If the bird dies , then everything can die , I think . Inside the tavern there is music from the jukebox . We are at the boathouse tavern again . It is a mild day , a Sundayafternoon . Dad is talking with some men ; Jerry and I are waiting by the boats . Mommy is at home with the new baby . I:rank has gone off with some friends of his , to a stock-car race . There are some people here , sitting out at the tables , but they do n't notice us . " Why does n't he hurry up ? " Jerry says . Jerry is twelve now . He has pimples on his forehead and chin . He pushes one of the rowboats with his foot . He is wearingp218sneakers that are dirty . I wish I could get in that boat and sit down , but I am afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boardwalk , smoking . You can tell he is in charge of the boats . " Daddy , come on . Come on , " Jerry says , whining . Daddy ca n't hear him . I have mosquito bites on my arms and legs . There are mosquitoesand flies around here ; the flies crawl around the sticky mess left on tables . A car over in the parking lot has its radio on loud . You can hear the music all this way . " He 's coming , " I tell Jerry so he wo n't be mad . Jerry is like Dad , the way his eyes look . " Oh , that fat guy keeps talking to him , " Jerry says . The fat man is one of the bartenders ; he has on a dirty white apron . All these men are familiar . We have been seeing them for years . He punches Dad 's arm , up by the shoulder , and Dad pushes him . They are laughing , though . Nobody is mad . " I 'd sooner let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear anything more , but the men laugh again . " All he does is drink , " Jerry says . " I hate him . " At school , up on the sixth-grade floor , Jerry got in trouble last month . The principal slapped him . I am afraid to look at Jerry when he 's mad . " I hate him , I wish he 'd die , " Jerry says . Dad is trying to come to us , but every time he takes a step backward and gets ready to turn , one of the men says something . There are three men beside him . Their stomachs are big , but Dad 's is n't . He is wearing dark pants and a white shirt ; his tie is in the car . He wears a tie to church , then takes it off . He has his shirt sleeves rolled up and you can see how strong his arms must be . Two women cross over from the parking lot . They are wearing high-heeled shoes and hats and bright dresses  --  orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . They go into the tavern . The men laugh about something . The way theyp219laugh makes my eyes focus on something away from them  --  a bird flying in the sky  --  and it is hard for me to look anywhere else . I feel as if I 'm falling asleep . " Here he comes ! " Jerry says . Dad walks over to us , with his big steps . He is smiling and carrying a bottle of beer . " Hey , kid , " he says to the boy squatting on the walk , " how 's about a boat ? " " This one is the best , " Jerry says . " The best , huh ? Great . " Dad grins at us . " Okay , Sissie , let 's get you in . Be careful now . " He picks me up even though I am too heavy for it , and sets me in the boat . It hurts a little where he held me , under the arms , but I do n't care . Jerry climbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips , but he catches himself . With the wet oar he pushes us off from the boardwalk . Dad can row fast . The sunlight is gleaming on the water . I sit very still , facing him , afraid to move . The boat goes fast , and Dad is leaning back and forth and pulling on the oars , breathing hard , doing everything fast like he always does . He is always in a hurry to get things done . He has set the bottle of beer down by his leg , pressed against the side of the boat so it wo n't fall . " There 's the guys we saw go out before , " Jerry says . Coming around the island is a boat with three boys in it , older than Jerry . " They went on the island . Can we go there too ? " " Sure , " says Dad . His eyes squint in the sun . He is suntanned , and there are freckles on his forehead . I am sitting close to him , facing him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a stranger , with his eyes narrowed . The water beneath the boat makes me feel funny . It keeps us up now , but if I fell over the side I would sink and drown . " Nice out here , huh ? " Dad says . He is breathing hard . " We should go over that way to get on the island , " Jerry says . " This goddamn oar has splinters in it , " Dad says . He hooks theoar up and lets us glide . He reaches down to get the bottle ofp220beer . Though the lake and some trees and the buildings back on shore are in front of me , what makes me look at it is my father 's throat , the way it bobs when he swallows . He wipes his forehead . " Want to row , Sissie ? " he says . " Can I ? " " Let me do it , " says Jerry . " Naw , I was just kidding , " Dad says . " I can do it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dad says . He starts rowing again , faster . Why does he go so fast ? His face is getting red , the way it does at home when he has trouble with Frank . He clears his throat and spits over the side ; I do n't like to see that but I ca n't help but watch . The other boat glides past us , heading for shore . The boys do n't look over at us . Jerry and I look to see if anyone else is on the island , but no one is . The island is very small . You can see around it . " Are you going to land on it , Dad ? " Jerry says . " Sure , okay . " Dad 's face is flushed and looks angry . The boat scrapes bottom and bumps . " Jump out and pull it in , " Dad says . Jerry jumps out . His shoes and socks are wet now , but Dad does n't notice . The boat bumps ; it hurts me . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dad is out and lifting me . " Nice ride , sugar ? " he says . Jerry and I run around the island . It is different from what we thought , but we do n't know why . There are some trees on it , some wild grass , and then bare caked mud that goes down to the water . The water looks dark and deep on the other side , but when we get there it 's shallow . Lily pads grow there ; everything is thick and tangled . Jerry wades in the water and gets his pants legs wet . " There might be money in the water , " he says . Some napkins and beer cans are nearby . There is part of a hotdogbun , with flies buzzing around it . When we go back by Dad , we see him squatting over the water doing something . His back jerks . Then I see that he isp221being sick . He is throwing up in the water and making a noise like coughing . Jerry turns around right away and runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side we can look back at the boathouse and wish we were there . Marian and Betty went to the show , but I could n't . She made me come along here with them . " And cut out that snippy face , " Ma said , to let me know she 's watching . I have to help her take care of Linda  --  poor fat Linda , with her runny nose ! So here we are inside the tavern . There 's too much smoke , I hate smoke . Dad is smoking a cigar . I wo n't drink any more root beer , it 's flat , and I 'm sick of potato chips . Inside me there is something that wants to run away , that hates them . How loud they are , my parents ! My mother spilled something on the front of her dress , but does she notice ? And my aunt Lucy and uncle Joe , they 're here . Try to avoid them . Lucy has false teeth that make everyone stare at her . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in my arms and turn away , I 'm so tired and my legs hurt from sunburn and I ca n't stand them any more . " So did you ever hear from them ? That letter you wrote ? " Ma says to Lucy . " I 'm still waiting . Somebody said you got to have connections to get on the show . But I do n't believe it . That Howie Masterson that 's the emcee , he 's a real nice guy . I can tell . " " It 's all crap , " Dad says . " You women believe anything . " " I do n't believe it , " I say . " Phony as hell , " says my uncle . " You do too believe it , Sissie , " says my mother . " Sissie thinks he 's cute . I know she does . "  | " I hate that guy ! " I tell her , but she and my aunt are laughing . " I said I hate him ! He 's greasy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Uncle Joe . He is tired all the time , and right now he sits with his head bowed . I hate his bald head with the little fringe of gray hair on it . At least my father is still handsome . His jaws sag and there are lines in his neck  --  edged with dirt , I can see , embarrassed  --  and his stomach is bulging a little against the table , but still he is a handsome man . In a place like this women look at him . What 's he see in her ? they think . My mother had her hair cut too short last time ; she looks queer . There is a photograph taken of her when she was young , standing by someone 's motorcycle , with her hair long . In the photograph she was pretty , almost beautiful , but I do n't believe it . Not really . I ca n't believe it , and I hate her . Her foreheadgathers itself up in little wrinkles whenever she glances down at Linda , as if she ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted you , kid , " she once said to Linda . Linda was a baby then , one year old . Ma was furious , standing in the kitchen where she was washing the floor , screaming : " Nobody wanted you , it was a goddamn accident ! An accident ! " That surprised me so I did n't know what to think , and I did n't know if I hated Ma or not ; but I kept it all a secret . . . only my girl friends know , and I wo n't tell the priest either . Nobody can make me tell . I narrow my eyes and watch my mother leaning forward to say something  --  it 's like sh , going to toss something out on the table  --  and think that ' tape she isr my mother after all , and she is n't that pretty girl in the photograph , but someone else . " A woman was on the show last night that lost two kids in a fire . Her house burned down , " my aunt says loudly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money and the audience went wild . You could see she was a real lady . I love that guy , Howie Masterson . He 's real sweet . " " He 's a bastard , " Dad says . " Harry , what the hell ? You never even seen him , " Ma says.  | " I sure as hell never did . Got better things to do at night . " Dad turns to my uncle and his voice changes . " I 'm on the night shift , now . " Yeah , I hate that , I  --  " " I can sleep during the day . What 's the difference ? " " I hate those night shifts . " " What 's there to do during the day ? " Dad says flatly . His eyes scan us at the table as if he does n't see anything , then they seem to fall off me and go behind me , looking at nothing . " Not much , " says my uncle , and I can see his white scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer into his glass and spills some of it . I wish I could look away . I love him , I think , but I hate to be here . Where would I rather be ? With Marian and Betty at the movies , or in my room , lying on the bed and staring at the photographs of movie stars on my walls  --  those beautiful people that never say anything  --  while out in the kitchen my mother is waiting for my father to come home so they can continue their quarrel . It never stops , that quarrel . Sometimes they laugh together , kid around , they kiss . Then the quarrel starts up again in a few minutes . " Ma , can I go outside and wait in the car ? " I say . " Linda 's asleep . " " What 's so hot about the car ? " she says , looking at me . " I 'm tired . My sunburn hurts . " Linda is sleeping in Ma 's lap , kith her mouth open and droolingon the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ma says . " But we 're not going to hurry just for you . " When she has drunk too much there is a struggle in her between being angry and being affectionate ; she fights both of them , as if standing with her legs apart and her hands on her hips , bracing a strong wind . When I cross through the crowded tavern I 'm conscious of people looking at me . My hair lost its curl because it was so humid today , my legs are too thin , my figure is flat and not nice like Marian 's  --  I want to hide somewhere , hide my face fromp224them . I hate this noisy place and these people . Even the music is ugly because it belongs to them . Then , when I 'm outside , the music gets faint right away and it does n't sound so bad . It 's cooler out here . No one is around . Out back , the old rowboats are tied up . Nobody 's on the lake . There 's no moon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn around , a man is standing by the door watching me . " What 're you doing ? " he says . " Nothing . " He has dark hair and a tanned face , I think , but everything is confused because the light from the door is pinkish  --  there 's a neon sign there . My heart starts to pound . The man leans forward to stare at me . " Oh , I thought you were somebody else , " he says . I want to show him I 'm not afraid . " Yeah , really ? Who did you think I was ? " When we ride on the school bus we smile out the windows at strange men , just for fun . We do that all the time . I 'm not afraid of any of them . " You 're not her , " he says . Some people come out the door and he has to step out of their way . I say to him , " Maybe you seen me around here before . We come here pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is smiling as if he thinks I 'm funny . " Anybody I know ? " " That 's my business . " It 's a game . I 'm not afraid . When I think of my mother and father inside , something makes me want to step closer to this man  --  why should I be afraid ? I could be wild like some of the other girls . Nothing surprises me . We keep on talking . At first I can tell he wants me to come inside the tavern with him , but then he forgets about it ; he keeps talking . I do n't know what we say , but we talk in drawling voices , smiling at each other but in a secret , knowing way ,  |p225as  if each one of us knew more than the other . My cheeks start to burn . I could be wild like Betty is sometimes  --  like some of the other girls . Why not ? Once before I talked with a man like this , on the bus . We were both sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and I keep talking and we talk about nothing , he wants to know how old I am , but it makes my heart pound so hard that I want to touch my chest to calm it . We are walking along the old boardwalk and I say : " Somebody took me out rowing once here . " " Is that so ? " he says . " You want me to take you out ? " He has a hard , handsome face . I like that face . Why is he alone ? When he smiles I know he 's laughing at me , and this makes me stand taller , walk with my shoulders raised . " Hey , are you with somebody inside there ? " he says . " I left them . " " Have a fight ? " " A fight , yes . " He looks at me quickly . " How old are you anyway ? " " That 's none of your business . " " Girls your age are all alike . " " We 're not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a way I must have learned somewhere  --  where ?  --  with my lips not smiling but ready to smile , and my eyes narrowed . One leg is turned as if I 'm ready to jump away from him . He sees all this . He smiles . " Say , you 're real cute . " We 're walking over by the parking lot now . He touches my arm . Right away my heart trips , but I say nothing , I keep walking . High above us the tree branches are moving in the wind . It 's cold for June . It 's late  --  after eleven . The man is wearing a jacket , but I have on a sleeveless dress and there are goose-pimpleson my arms . " Cold , huh ? " he says . He takes hold of my shoulders and leans toward me . This is to show me he 's no kid , he 's grown-up , this is how they do things ;  |p226when  he kisses me his grip on my shoulders gets tighter . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My voice is queer . " What ? " he says . I am wearing a face like one of those faces pinned up in my room , and what if I lose it ? This is not my face . I try to turn away from him . He kisses me again . His breath smells like beer , maybe , it 's like my father 's breath , and my mind is empty ; I ca n't think what to do . Why am I here ? My legs feel numb , my fingers are cold . The man rubs my arms and says , " You should have a sweater or something . . . . " He is waiting for me to say something , to keep on the way I was before . But I have forgotten how to do it . Before , I was Marianor one of the older girls ; now I am just myself . I am fourteen . I think of Linda sleeping in my mother 's lap , and something frightens me . " Hey , what 's wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pretends he does n't . He comes to me again and embraces me , his mouth presses against my neck and shoulder , I feel as if I 'm suffocating . " My car 's over here , " he says , trying to catch his breath . I ca n't move . Something dazzling and icy rises up in me , an awful fear , but I ca n't move and ca n't say anything . He is touching me with his hands . His mouth is soft but wants too much from me . I think , What is he doing ? Do they all do this ? Do I have to have it done to me too ? " You cut that out , " I tell him . He steps away . His chest is heaving and his eyes look like a dog 's eyes , surprised and betrayed . The last thing I see of him is those eyes , before I turn and run back to the tavern.  |p227Jesse  says , " Let 's stop at this place . I been here a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That big old building with the grubby siding , and a big pink neon sign in front , and the cinder driveway that 's so bumpy . Yes , everything the same . But different too  --  smaller , dirtier . There is a custard stand nearby with a glaring orange roof , and people are crowded around it . That 's new . I have n't been here for years . " I feel like a beer , " he says . He smiles at me and caresses my arm . He treats me as if I were something that might break ; in my cheap linen maternity dress I feel ugly and heavy . My flesh is so soft and thick that nothing could hurt it . " Sure , honey . Pa used to stop in here too . " We cross through the parking lot to the tavern . Wild grass grows along the sidewalk and in the cracks of the sidewalk . Why is this place so ugly to me ? I feel as if a hand were pressing against my chest , shutting off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I afraid ? I catch sight of myself in a dusty window as we pass . My hair is long , down to my shoulders . I am pretty , but my secret is that I am pretty like everyone is . My husband loves me for this but does n't know it . I have a pink mouth and plucked darkened eyebrows and soft bangs over my forehead ; I know everything , I have no need to learn from anyone else now . I am one of those girls younger girls study closely , to learn from . On buses , in fiveand-tens , thirteen-year-old girls must look at me solemnly , learning , memorizing . " Pretty Sissie ! " my mother likes to say when we visit , though I told her how I hate that name . She is proud of me for beingp228pretty , but thinks I 'm too thin . " You 'll fill out nice , after the baby , " she says . Herself , she is fat and veins have begun to darken on her legs ; she scuffs around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of her I ca n't think of anything  --  do I love her or hate her , or is there nothing there ? Jesse forgets and walks ahead of me , I have to walk fast to catch up . I 'm wearing pastel-blue high heels  --  that must be because I am proud of my legs . I have little else . Then he remembersand turns to put out his hand for me , smiling to show he is sorry . Jesse is the kind of young man thirteen-year-old girls stare at secretly ; he is not a man , not old enough , but not a boy either . He is a year older than I am , twenty . When I met him he was wearing a navy uniform and he was with a girl friend of mine . Just a few people sitting outside at the tables . They 're afraid of rain  --  the sky does n't look good . And how bumpy the ground is here , bare spots and little holes and patches of crab grass , and everywhere napkins and junk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The screens at the windows do n't fit right ; you can see why flies get inside . Jesse opens the door for me and I go in . All bars smell alike . There is a damp , dark odor of beer and something indefinable  --  spilled soft drinks , pretzels getting stale ? This bar is just like any other . Before we were married we went to places like this , Jesse and me and other couples . We had to spend a certain amount of time doing things like that  --  and going to movies , playing miniature golf , bowling , dancing , swimming  --  then we got married , now we 're going to have a baby . I think of the baby all the time , because my life will be changed then ; everything will be different . Four months from now . I should be frightened , but a calm laziness has come over me . It was so easy for my mother . . . . But it will be different with me because my life will be changed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't change her ! Why should I think ? Why should I be afraid ? My body is filled with love for this baby , and I will never be the same again.  |p229We  sit down at a table near the bar . Jesse is in a good mood . My father would have liked him , I think ; when he laughs Jesse reminds me of him . Why is a certain kind of simple , healthy , honest man always destined to lose everything ? Their souls are as clean and smooth as the muscular line of their arms . At night I hold Jesse , thinking of my father and what happened to him  --  all that drinking , then the accident at the factory  --  and I pray that Jesse will be different . I hope that his quick , open , loud way of talking is just a disguise , that really he is someone else  --  slower and calculating . That kind of man grows old without jerks and spasms . Why did I marry Jesse ? Someone at the bar turns around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have known . Yes . That man outside , the man I met outside . I stare at him , my heart pounding , and he does n't see me . He is dark , his hair is neatly combed but is thinner than before ; he is wearing a cheap gray suit . But is it the same man ? He is standing with a friend and looking around , as if he does n't like what he sees . He is tired too . He has grown years older . Our eyes meet . He glances away . He does n't remember  --  that frightened girl he held in his arms . I am tempted to put my hand on Jesse 's arm and tell him about that man , but how can I ? Jesse is talking about trading in our car for a new one . . . . I ca n't move , my mind seems to be coming to a stop . Is that the man I kissed , or someone else ? A feeling of angry loss comes over me . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and would he remember ? My heart bothers me , it 's stupid to be like this : here I sit , powdered and sweet , a girl safely married , pregnant and secured to the earth , with my husband beside me . He still loves me . Our love keeps on . Like my parents ' love , it will subside someday , but nothing surprises me because I have learned everything . The man turns away , talking to his friend . They are weary , tired of something . He is n't married yet , I think , and that pleases me . Good . But why are these men always tired ? Is it the jobs theyp230hold , the kind of men who stop in at this tavern ? Why do they flash their teeth when they smile , but stop smiling so quickly ? Why do their children cringe from them sometimes  --  an innocentupraised arm a frightening thing ? Why do they grow old so quickly , sitting at kitchen tables with bottles of beer ? They are everywhere , in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods around here . Jesse is young , but the outlineof what he will be is already in his face ; do you think I ca n't see it ? Their lives are like hands dealt out to them in their innumerablecard games . You pick up the sticky cards , and there it is : there it is . Ca n't change anything , all you can do is switch some cards around , stick one in here , one over here . . . pretend there is some sense , a secret scheme . The man at the bar tosses some coins down and turns to go . I want to cry out to him , " Wait , wait ! " But I can not . I sit helplessly and watch him leave . Is it the same man ? If he leaves I will be caught here , what can I do ? I can almost hear my mother 's shrill laughter coming in from outside , and some drawling remark of my father 's  --  lifting for a moment above the music . Those little explosions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damp table in anger , the clink of bottles accidentally touching  --  and there , there , my drunken aunt 's voice , what is she saying ? I am terrified at being left with them . I watch the man at the door and think that I could have loved him . I know it . He has left , he and his friend . He is nothing to me , but suddenly I feel tears in my eyes . What 's wrong with me ? I hate everything that springs upon me and seems to draw itself down and oppress me in a way I could never explain to anyone . . . . I am crying because I am pregnant , but not with that man 's child . It could have been his child , I could have gone with him to his car ; but I did nothing , I ran away , I was afraid , and now I 'm sitting here with Jesse , who is picking the label off his beer bottle with his thick squarish fingernails . I did nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can I do ?  |p231I  let my hand fall onto my stomach to remind myself that I am in love : with this baby , with Jesse , with everything . I am in love with our house and our life and the future and even this moment  --  right now  --  that I am struggling to live through.  |p232She  came out the side door , with the dog tugging at his leash . The worn leather grip jerked her hand and she said in a hushed , embarrassed voice : " Stop that , you know better ! Stop that ! " The dog was vain and partly bald . She never thought of him as an animal , but as an extension of her father , whose dog he was ; indeed , the dog resembled his master . Both had vague mottled skin , liverish and brown as if camouflaged , and their eyes were watery with alertness . It seemed to Eileen that their ears , though of different shapes and colors , had in common an unclear , intangiblequality of intensity  --  they both heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words not spoken aloud , heard even the echoes of words that should have faded away.  |p233She  took the long side walk to the street , holding back on the leash . The dog panted and yipped in a high womanish falsetto ; there was a squirrel nearby . The dog wanted so badly to tear flesh with his jaws that Eileen stared at his flat , brutal skull and thought clearly that it would be better if this dog died so that they could have some peace . The dog belonged in the house the way Eileen 's sister Marcey belonged : both were possessions of the old man and could get away with anything . The fact was that they never really did anything at all . They belonged to the old man . Eileen 's mother was an invalid , or claimed to be , and she had nothing to do with the dog , which was not allowed above the landing  --  nor was the dog allowed in the parlor etc. , etc.  --  these were the rules of the house that Eileen had grown up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , each house on each street encumbered with balding vicious dogs and fathers and mothers and sisters , one sister good because she was " slow " and the other  --  Eileen herself  --  questionable because she was not slow . " Stop that , you know better ! Stop ! " Once on the sidewalk she could scold the dog more openly , since no one in the house could hear . But the dog paid no attention . He yanked at the leash and dipped his head as if he were trying to get free of the collar , a futile attempt . Eileen watched him with a passive hatred , nothing new . Then she saw him waddleto a tree and so she stopped watching and glanced back toward the house . She wanted no intimate relationship with the dog , and it was strange how perfectly respectable men and women , dignified and well-to-do , could walk dogs and think nothing of what they were involved in : it had no dignity , it was embarrassing , and yet there they were . Eileen noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather formal house , set far back from the street , with empty spires and cupolas in a style that had always seemed to Eileen the only style for living . Living demandedrestraint and a constant tugging back at the leash ; you ,  |p234never  gave in , never let the dog free . Never . The lace curtains at the front bay window moved a little . That meant her father was watching . She stared gloomily across the weedy front lawn and tried to make out his face , but saw nothing . Certainly he was watching her . And perhaps their eyes were meeting . But there was no acknowledgment , nothing . The old man stood safely back in the shadows , and back in the kitchen Marcey was making dinner  --  itwas about five o'clock  --  and upstairs in the big bedroom with the silk wallpaper and the chandelier imported fromwhere ?  --  Belgium ?  --  hermother lay under a series of blankets that never warmed her , not even in this late June heat . Eileen 's mother was a silent , peeved woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , relentless and cunning beneath that domination . There was a special kind of slyness that only grew out of being handled cruelly , but Eileen could not quite master it . At the age of twenty-seven she felt a comic absurdity in her own situation , her inability to master her life or even to sit down and think clearly about it . It seemed there was always static in her brain when she tried to think about such things , or someone in the house wanted something . Or the dog wanted to go out . She walked along a little faster . This pleased the dog . The sidewalk they took every afternoon was strangely cracked , and parts of it looked as if they were heaved up by a swelling in the ground . Sometimes this was caused by the roots of great elms that lined the boulevard , and sometimes it was caused by sudden shifts in the ground . It gave a patchwork look to the neighborhood . All the houses were old , of varying styles . There were garagesattached to them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once servants ' quarters but now just room for junk ; Eileen 's father was on the lookout for changes in the neighborhood and whenever he got word that someone wanted to take in boarders he wrote to the City Council and to the mayor and to several attorneys and judges . So the old servants ' quarters remainedempty and the neighborhood itself looked as if it werep235somehow withdrawing , emptying out secretly . Lawns were vast and , even when cared for , looked like deserts of silence . No childrenwould run across these lawns , never again . It was strange , but there were no children . Dog , but not children . A few old people and a few servants and a few younger people like Eileen walked dogs daily in this neighborhood , but children never appeared , and even the dogs were not dogs that barked . In summer everything took too long , Eileen thought . She liked better the harsh fast days of winter , when a late morning ran foggily into an early evening , and the afternoons were squeezed small . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard too much . And people strolling out on the sidewalk might hear too much from inside the house ; certain peevish shrill remarkswere just the kind to carry all the way out into the street . She was crossing the street by the Norlan mansion when the dog jerked his leash again . He was after another squirrel . Eileen pulled him back and heard a low growling in his throat that frightened her absurdly . . . . For a moment they stood in a frozen tug of war , the girl with her heels firm on the sidewalk , leaning backward a little , her hand holding the leash down hard against her thigh , and the angry dog tottering on his hind legs in a small semicircle , his forelegs pawing the air and yearning outward , away from the leash and collar . Then something snapped . The collar gave way and the dog lunged forward and ran blindly across the street . Eileen looked around in surprise and saw a car bump the dog gently , as if this car had been lying in wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leap forward . But the bump was gentle . Yet , Eileen saw in horror , the dog lay like a sack and was silent . The driver was out of the car before Eileen got there . The dog was dead , it seemed . Blood ran in small stringy rivulets out of its mouth . The driver 's shoes were dusty and Eileen bent over the dog , stared at them , waiting for the dog to shake itself back to life , but groggily interested in the shoes . She did not seem top236understand that a man was talking to her . After a minute or so , when it appeared that her father 's dog was really dead and would not get up again , she brought her widened gaze slowly up the column of the man 's body and saw that he was talking to her . " What ? Yes , " she said in a vague , flat voice . " Yes , it was an accident . I know . It was the dog 's fault . " " Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I do n't know . It 's my father 's dog , not mine . I do n't think he would want the police , he does n't like police . . . he does n't approve of police in this neighborhood . ... Except the private police . I do n't know where they are . They 're somewhere .... " " Are you all right ? " He was a man of about thirty-five , a stranger . He wore a light summer suit and had a casual , anxious look about him ; his concern for the dog was in a way too real , exaggerated . The dog was no longer real to Eileen except as it represented a problem she was to have in a few minutes with her father . But the dog itself was not real and was an embarrassment . She said slowly , " Yes , I 'm all right . But it was the dog 's fault , you saw it . " " I could n't stop in time . " " He has tried to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the car would hit him . . . . " " It 's my father 's dog mainly , " she said , straightening . The man 's gaze was tawny and fair , rather like her own . He had a bridge of freckles across his nose and forehead , and she did not , but his light brown hair was the same color as hers . There was something tense and giddy in the air between them , some fragmentationof light or time . It was as if they had stepped into the shadow of an eclipse no one else knew about ; as if , between the pompous peelings of a church 's bells on Sunday , they had sought out each other for a secret look . " Do you live nearby ? I can drive you home and take the dog . " " I 'd be very grateful .... "  |p237He  wrapped the dog in canvas from the trunk of his car and lay the body on the back seat . Eileen began to cry . She believed that she had always liked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but perhaps her father had come between them and made it impossible for her to feel affection . . . and at the same time she understood that this was an absurd idea . " Sometimes I think , in this place , that I 'm losing my mind . " It came out with a hoarse , alarmed little laugh , and the man turned to her in surprise . " I 'm sorry , I should n't have said that , " Eileen said . " I 've caused you enough trouble today . . . . " " It was my fault , really . " " I think it was my fault . . . . " " Did you say it was your father 's dog ? Is he an old man , I mean , will he be very upset ? " Eileen got in the car slowly , thinking . Was her father an old man ? She often thought of him as the old man ; but she was not sure that other people would think him old . Old men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while her father got stronger year after year and the cords in his neck grew tougher . " He 's about sixty-eight , I think . Yes , he 'll be upset . " " I 'd like to pay you  --  " " No , no . Father would n't hear of that . Please do n't mention that . " " Are you sure you 're all right ? You seem a little upset . " He closed the door on her side and went around to get in . Eileen glanced around and saw that the dog was still dead , still dead . She had hoped it would shake itself back into life . The driver got in and looked at her . It was apparent that this man  --  with his air of having somewhere to get to , his intelligent , masculineworry  --  thought she was peculiar . Perhaps insane ? She wanted to explain to him with a laugh that she was really not insane , though external evidence seemed to indicate that she wasp238not quite normal . She would have liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Education ; the few love letters a young man had once sent her ; the snapshots of her and a girl friend in Maine , one happy summer a long time ago . These were proofs of her being normal , or at least of her having been normal , in those years before she gave up and returned home . But she had returned home . She had given up her job in New York , her friends , her own apartment , she had given up wearing lipstick because it annoyed her father , she had even given up thinking , except on long hot summer afternoons . So perhaps he was right in staring at her that way ? " You seem to be afraid of something , " he said . " Yes . My father , " she said . Her teeth had begun to chatter . The next morning she sat in the kitchen , in a patch of sunlight , thinking . There was an air of silence around her that was the silence forced upon a guilty child , and her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; there was somethinggirlish and sweet about her affection for Eileen . " He wo n't be mad no more . Not today . You go see , " Marcey whispered . Eileen drew her hand wearily across her face . She was trying to think past yesterday 's scene with her father , and past the scene in the garden where they 'd buried the dog , past all this clutter , to that stranger 's face . She was disturbed that she could not recall it . Her sister Marcey leaned down to look at her . " You crying ? " she said . " No , I 'm not crying , " Eileen said . Marcey was finishing up the breakfast dishes . All the kitchenworkwas her work , all the housework . She wanted to do it and would grow angry , even violent , if Eileen tried to help . But Eileenhad not tried to help for twelve years . Marcey was a big , soft girl in a flowered house dress . She wore bedroom slippers most ofp239the time because her feet ached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie but somehow out of focus , or , rather , the features were not quite balanced ; perhaps one eye was slightly larger than the other , or one nostril larger than the other . She was a strong , pleasant girl when she got her way , and there was a constant air of heat surrounding her , as if she were always in a hurry . " Poor Rob , " Marcey sighed . Rob was the dog 's name . But when Marcey said that name it belonged to a person ; just as it was a person 's name in their father'smouth . Eileen sat and tried to think . She was waiting for her father to come back to the kitchen . He was reading the morningpaper in his study . In a while he would come back here and ask for coffee and perhaps he would look at her in a certain way . . . . She was waiting to be forgiven , though she knew it was foolish and degrading . Still , she sat waiting . Her former life , abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , nothing mattered to her so much as her family , had withdrawn to a few pieces of junk up in her room , souvenirs 1 of another life that must have been rather festive . Certainly it had not been serious . She had taught art to fifth-grade students , how unreal . . . . That had been several years ago . At last Eileen heard her father coming . She sat up and stared hard out the window , like a child . It was a bramble bush she stared into , a mess of what had once been a garden ; there was a streaked gray statue somewhere in that clutter , of a boy riding a fish . The statue was in the center of a fountain , long since dried up . Wasps buzzed around it and had she ever wanted to explore , she would have been forbidden entry . She sat quietly and awaited her father . He was a tall , handsome man with silver hair that was thinning . His liverish scalp was beginning to show . Eileen stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid and it was crazy . He ignored her . Marcey was his darling , Marcey was thirty-six years old and all of nine years old in the head , she wasp240her parents ' darling and had been so for the last twenty-five years . As soon as they had guessed at her problem they had baptized her for their own , their special love . Eileen thought these thoughts bitterly , but knew that they were true . " Father , I hope you are n't still angry about the dog , " Eileen said . " Fill up this cup . Where 's the cream ? " her father said to Marcey . Marcey bobbed around and handed him the cream . She was a good , good girl . The flesh on her upper arms bobbed with her . Eileen stared at the two of them , her kin , the attractive cold man with bluish veins streaking his forehead like cobwebs , and the childish hulking woman in her yellow dress . Yes , indeed . Her kin . She felt a pang of jealousy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years but had nearly forgotten . " But it 's foolish to go on this way , " she said intelligently , like a teacher . " After all , we do have to live in the same house . " Her father dressed well every day , though he rarely bothered to leave the house . Even in summer he wore a vest . His clothes were excellent , expensive clothes , though certainly out of date now ; but what did that matter ? He was an icy , shrewd , cruel man whose vocation was money . When Eileen had left home she often thought of her father as crazy , but that was too simple . It was inaccurate . He was not crazy ; he was himself . He had never made an error in his life in any financial situation . Or perhaps any other . No errors , nothing . His business day began at nine in the morning and ended usually at about ten ; he used the telephone . " Marcey , bring me out some biscuits . And butter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left them , his daughters . Two women ! Marcey was the pleased , fluttery wife and Eileen the icy , rejected bride . She stared at her sister 's simple face and remembered the thoughts she 'd had so often as a child , crying upstairsp241in her bed or out behind the garage , when she had wanted nothingso much as Marcey 's death so that she , Eileen , could take her place . Why not ? She could take Marcey 's place and no one would miss Marcey . . . . Now she sighed at the futile cruelty of such thoughts . For nothing had ever happened . It was she , Eileen , who had caught colds and chills ; Marcey was always well . She was strong and healthy as the old man . Eileen took after her mother , the two of them being people who , when alone , have nothing better to do than listen nervously to their hearts . Such people ! They do not take their pulses , but only because they are too squeamish ... . Eileen went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good for her . She ought to be getting away as she had promised herself , breaking free as soon as it was clear that her mother was not really dying . ( Eileen 's mother had gone to bed , stricken , in order to get Eileen home . ) But at the thought of packing her things and calling a taxi , at the thought of going to the decrepit railroad station . . . she grew vague and restless and glanced around as if waiting to be distracted . The morning sun was warm on her cheek . It was like the gaze of that strange man , which was returning to her now that she was away from home . She walked slowly and languorously . It surprised her to understand that she was still an attractive woman , a very young woman . Her hair was cut short so that the tips of her ears showed , and it was fluffed up carelessly around her head . She had a small , serious , childlike face , with clear blue eyes . Her face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . But Marcey was the child , the true child ; Eileen herself was supposedto be rather intelligent . But what did you do with intelligence , how could you use it ? And her body was useless , just a thin body . She had a dancer 's body , but no dance . What pumped in her veins but the same cold blue ink that threaded up through her father 's regal forehead ?  |p242She  walked for a long time , back and forth along the winding streets . This neighborhood was an old , excellent neighborhood rather near the downtown of a large city , and fifty years ago millionaireshad built their extravagant homes here , on huge lots . It was railroad money mostly . Now the houses were inhabited by a few old people with many servants , or a young family who had inherited , with distrust and daring , or no one at all . Ghosts . Dust . Vandals committed atrocities in secret , and though these were usually kept out of the newspaper , Eileen 's father knew every detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fire last year that it was the Archbishop 's mansion and nothing else , and he had been right . A blaze in the west wing caused by a secretary careless of her smoking , he had even guessed that . Eileenremembered her childhood and it seemed to her that she honestly remembered more people in this neighborhood once : but perhaps she was imagining it . There would be a time when , like her mother , she would have to imagine everything . Then she saw it  --  the car from yesterday . The stranger 's car . It was parked in a driveway , the Heilmans ' driveway . Eileen paused , wondering . She had not really noticed yesterday that the car was several years old . But the Heilmans ' house was many years old , almost shabby . It needed repairwork . And the front lawn was a lost cause , burned out already in June , hopeless . The Heilmans ' man , a Negro of more than seventy , was fooling around by the side porch , trying to wash out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to see what the word was , but she supposed it was the same word she 'd seen scrawled in white , or black , or red , quite frequently around the neighborhood . Little Negro boys , no kin to the Heilmans ' Negro , were the criminals . It was hopeless . She was standing there when the man appeared , her friend of yesterday . He descended the outside stairs of the servants ' quarter , a rather tidy and pleasant brick building . Ah yes , Eileenp243thought shrewdly , they are making money illegally . They are renting . The man had seen her and was approaching her in his shirt sleeves . He came toward her as if he 'd been waiting to see her and was quite pleased . " Hello , " he said , smiling . She smiled in return . They talked rather awkwardly . Eileen felt reckless and oddly angry ; her lower lip felt greedy . She kept saying no , no , it had been the dog 's fault . . . . Then they suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defacing of the Heilman'sscreened porch . But they laughed again , surprising themselves , and their laughter faded swiftly when they glanced at each other : they were so much alike  --  how strange ! His hair was rather long for a man 's , and if it were a few inches longer it would look like hers . " What are you doing here , living here ? " Eileen said . He began to answer her , courteously and simply , and as she listened she had the idea suddenly that he was not telling the truth . He spoke too earnestly . In her girlhood she had loved boys , sometimes not at a distance , and always a certain giddiness began in the back of her head when she stood near them : this giddiness now began . It was girlish and pleasant , but , farther down , was a cold , hard seriousness that frightened her . She wanted to slide her arm through his and lean against him . She wanted to say , Oh , I know what you want , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at herself for thinking this . He asked her to walk and she agreed . Why not ? She felt a lazy stirring in her , but it was not soft as it should be in a woman ; it was hard . She felt that she was half a man in this conversation , half the man she walked with and half herself , the one nudging and guiding them , the other being nudged , being guided . Was this the way real women felt about men ? Real women ? Did they discover a man who broke open the stubborn little cells of their blood and did they at once give themselves to him ? Did theyp244force such men into love ? She felt rather reckless ; the obscenity on the Heilmans ' front porch could have come to her lips , her own lips . " I 'm involved in a kind of crazy situation . My parents . . . " And she went on to tell him the whole story , which she 'd told to friends at college and elsewhere , acting out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failings of her life . See , she seemed to say , I know I am wasting myself , I know I 'm chained to them , but I ca n't help it . " Well , you could move out . I left my home , " the man said . She was disappointed at this and said nothing . " Of course , if they 're old and they need you ... " " They really do need me . It 's serious , " she said . " And your sister must need you too . " " Yes , she needs me . They all need me really . " She waited for him to argue with her . They walked on in silence . Then she heard herself say bitterly , " It 's my sister Marcey who should go away . " When she returned home that afternoon her father was waiting . Yes , he knew . He had not seen them talking idly , on the brink of love , but he knew . He knew everything . When Eileen turned up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was ghostly and yet quite hard , standing there behind the lace , visible and invisible . He opened the door for her . " And where is Rob ? " he said politely . " Rob is not here , Father . " " What did you do with Rob ? " Her teeth began to chatter . The old man spoke in a loud actor 's voice so that Marcey in the kitchen could hear and the old woman upstairs could hear , lying in bed or maybe crouched by the top of the stairs in secret . ( Eileen believed that her mother couldp245get out of bed , and did : how else to explain things on her bedstandthat had certainly been on her bureau the night before ? ) " I asked you what you did with Rob . Where is his leash ? " " Father , you know what happened to Rob . " " Where is he ? " " You know what happened . " He stood there in his immaculate suit , contemptuous of her . She could not look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt herself shrinking rapidly into a child , as if she were being propelled backward along a road , seeing everything unraveling backward and getting smaller . She began to cry , defendingherself . She said , Father , Father ! She sank to her knees before the old man , half awake to the cleverness of this gesture and half deluded ; she begged , " Please , Father , you 're making yourself sick , you 're losing your mind  --  " But it was she who was sick and demented . The old man was in control . He seized her by her hair , a fistful of hair , and shook her head from side to side . " You let him get killed  --  you let him loose ! Let him loose ! You never liked him and so you let him loose ! " Her father 's shouting awakened everyone in the house and out of the kitchen Marcey came , in a hurry . She stumbled against something but righted herself . Both Eileen and her father looked around , united , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor toward them . . . . Her father said , grabbing her , " Get inside here , " and , suddenly docile , she scrambled to her feet and ran into the study . Just in time . The old man slammed the door and Marcey 's yells began and Eileen , clever as a child , knew enough to lock the door . Marcey had gone mad , yes . Mad . Eileen had been waiting in terror for this for years . Mad with a butcher knife , with a scissors , with a burning hot iron ? She had thought that her death might be a crazy death , over which she 'd have no control . Now she went to the telephone and dialed the number of the police station with her clever , trembling fingers.  |p246She  had carried the number around in her head for years , since the first time Marcey had turned on her : she had been only five then , and Marcey had tried to drown her in the old fountain . The next morning it was Eileen who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father went upstairs  --  her father carrying the tray like a gentleman  --  and they ate with her mother , who was sitting up in bed for the occasion . Their grief seemed to make their fingers longer and hungrier . " Yes , I saw it coming , " Eileen 's mother said sourly , and her father was polite enough not to contradict her . Despite their stricken bodies , their faces were set to enjoy a kind of ceremonial meal . " A terrible thing , a scandal , " Eileen 's mother complained . " And what about my poor good girl here , what if she 'd been hurt ? " Eileen felt a stab of pleasure . " Marcey could n't help it , she was sick . " " Not sick . Sickness can be cured , but Marcey 's trouble can never be cured . I always said that , " said the mother . " Maybe in a while  --  " " I always said that . " Eileen 's mother was a woman who was easy to forget . Her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eileen from time to time found herself thinking that her mother really had carried through her threat and died . But of course the old woman was quite alive and , despite her mysterious illnesses , she seemed quite strong . She dabbed powder on , and cologne , and her bedroom was an eyesore of expensive antiques . They talked about Marcey . They talked about all the indicationsMarcey had given over the years , how they should have guessed this might happen finally . Despite the childish satisfactionshe felt in being at her mother 's bedside at last , as if she and her father were making a charity visit and were certainly going to leave together , Eileen felt a peculiar hollow sensation . Itp247was a sickish feeling . Something was not right , something was incomplete . That day she did not go out because she was much too busy . She waited on her mother . Without Marcey , her mother needed her all the time . " I suppose we should have a girl again , " Eileen'smother said . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all , " Eileen said . But she spoke without enthusiasm . It was odd that her sister 's disappearance should not mean very much to her after all . After so many years . She had always thought that her life would begin when Marcey was carried off , but now she was not so certain . That week was spent in work around the house . She made all the meals and cleaned part of the house  --  only part of it was still used  --  and she fixed herself up for their pleasure , like a child . But it was a masquerade . She fooled them but could not fool herself . Released from the slightly heady air of their meals together , and released for the day from her mother 's demands , she stared out her window at the great spotlight her father had erected outside . She waited to see a figure moving down there , a prowler . No one ? Where was that man ? He knew where she lived , but he had not come near . A week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been the heat of July , because her body felt angry and deprived . She kept thinking of that man . In close contact with men some ten or twelve times in her life , she had really not felt much : a kind of curiosity , part scientific . Little emotion . But , away from men , she tended to think about them and to idealize all maneuvers of physical love . She brooded upon this mysterious man and wondered if he had told her the truth , wondered who he was , why he had come out to talk with her , whether she would ever see him again . . . . She felt a certain gratitude toward him for having rid her life of that dog and of her sister . Yes , she was grateful . And that night she dreamed of him , a dream of love ; and a f ter she woke alarmed by this dream she slept again and dreamedp248his dream of her , from his point of view . She was a pretty vase of a woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? What could a man do with such a woman ? She woke and walked angrily about her room . She looked out at the bluish spotlight , hating it because it might be keeping something from her . The spotlight lit up the ground with a weird graveyard festivity , but there was no festivity . It was a blank , moonlit , waiting for something to happen . She wanted that man and she was angry at anyone , anyone who kept him from her . She had never felt so dangerous and senseless . Imagine her fatherpeering out the curtains at that man , should he ever come up to the front door !  --  what man would pass through the look of a skull 's head in order to get to her ? The next day she woke early to her mother 's thumping . She had to hurry to take care of her mother , who needed help getting to her bathroom . The old woman was a surprise out of bed , so small and brittle and clinging , like a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good girl , yes , my good girl , " and Eileen tried to smile ; after all , her mother could not help being an invalid . Eileen herself felt very tired . After she finished with her morning work she slipped out the side door , stepping into a thick wall of heat . The air was oppressive , as if it were the air of another planet smothering the earth 's air with its own languorous , perfumey air . At the front walk she tried to resist looking back , but she did turn and saw what she believed to be her father 's figure behind the curtains . Yes , certainlyit was he . Neither gave any sign of recognition and Eileen walked on as if she had somewhere to get to . She kept thinking , I will explain it to him . . . but she could not complete the sentence because she did n't understand it . It was as if another voice were speaking in her brain , taking over . She walked fast , glad to be deprived of the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tug of that dog 's leash . Shep249headed up toward the Heilmans ' house . An accidental glance at her mother 's limp , yellowish flesh that morning had frightened her : was that all that lay before her ? What did it mean ? Why were things so easily lost when , in one 's keeping , they had seemed to have no value anyway ? She had begun to perspire , and a sense of recklessness overtook her . Truly this was the air of another planet , a jungle air . She believed she saw that man ahead of her , turning up a walk , but it was evidently someone who lived there  --  in a great English Tudor home that needed repairs . Still , her heart had given a lurch . Walking on , she believed she saw him again , on foot , this time strolling toward her on the other side of the street . When they grew nearer , however , she saw that it was n't he but a young man in a pale , sporty outfit , something beige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were about to pass , she glanced over and saw that it was that man after all  --  he was looking at her too . She paused . He lifted one arm in a tentative gesture , motioning her over to his side of the street . He was on the walk by the Norlan estate . Eileen did cross the street . She said nervously , " Something terriblehappened at home  --  something terrible  --  " The man was smiling at her , as if pleased . He was wearing a beige pull-over shirt and white trousers , and light canvas shoes . She had the idea he had put on this outfit for her . " My sister had to be taken away . You know , my sister , I told you about her  --  " He nodded and his smile withdrew politely . " How have you been ? " he said . She stared at him . His eyes were fixed upon her greedily ; heseemed at any instant about to smile again . " It was terrible , the way she had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quiet her and . . . and I guess she 'll never be let out . . . I mean . . . it 's up to us to agree to that . . . " But she saw that he was not interested in her sister and it occurred to her that she was no longer interested in that topic either.  | " Let 's walk through here . Inside here , " he said . He meant the Norlans ' park , or what was left of their park . Eileen stared at him . " But someone might see us  --  " " The house is empty . Just servants . " " They might see us still  --  " " Come on . Let 's get off the street , " he said . She hesitated , wondering if this were a joke . But he took hold of her arm and pulled her along . " I was out walking every day this week , " he said . " Did n't you say you 'd meet me ? " Eileen could not remember having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might have said it . He led her on , into the heart of the old estate , which consisted of a city block of ragged trees and shrubs and ferns gone wild ; behind the old house was a rose gardenwith the usual fountain and statues . The Norlan estate had a wild , decadent air about it , as if the jungle were encroaching upon it in the heart of a great city ; it had a strangely private air . Eileen 's man did not release her but pulled her on , and she forced herself to think of what might happen ; was she ready for it ? Had she wanted this ? " We should go back . We should n't be in here , " she said . " Now , do n't talk like that , " said the man with a grimace of impatience . She was staring at his pale lashes  --  very like her own  --  when the first rain drops began to fall . Heedless of the rain , his face swung toward her , very serious and impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . His body was warm and damp . Eileen 's heart began to beat violently and she thought , I 'm going to die , and a part of her fled backward to the old house in which her parents awaited her , askingthem for help . But still she embraced this man ; for all her awkwardness , it was an affectionate embrace . He leaned back and smiled at her . There were pale , fair specks in the iris of his eyes . " I 'm afraid , " Eileen said , " please do n't  --  " " We can be alone here , " he said . But she was afraid , and she began to shiver with a fear that was part fear of this man and part fear of her father ;  |p251she  slipped in the wet grass and would have fallen except for limn . " I ca n't love you or anyone , " she said bitterly , " it 's because of him  --  I mean him back at the house  --  my father . I ca n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the man . " Talk ? Talk about what ? " Eileen said in surprise . They talked , and as time passed she drew back from him like a fiat-footed dancer who has lost the rhythm of the dance . Seen from a distance , they had the lively , sullen look of statues in privategardens , arrested in the fulfillment of some intricate dance . 1 le talked about himself , and then instructed her to talk about herself . And she talked , but the flood of truth she told him  --  meticulous and tedious  --  was no more convincing than what she supposed to be his lies . Sometime later they emerged from the park , damp and criminal . " I 'm sorry that I 'm afraid of you . I ca n't help it , " Eileen said . Her voice was a little hysterical and accusing . The man lit a cigarette , which was exactly the right gesture ; it gave them both the healthy anonymity of movie actors . Even the rain was cinematic . They walked back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't think I can see you again . I do n't think so . " He said , " Tomorrow , the same time . " " No , I 'm afraid . " " Tomorrow you wo n't be . " They approached her house , and she knew that the old man must be watching them . He must have been standing at the windowall these hours . Her cheeks began to burn , and she said in a strange singsong voice , " He 's watching us right now , right now . " " There 's nobody there . At the window ? Nobody . " They turned up the walk , bedraggled from the rain but also given over to a kind of reckless bravery . " We 'll go right in and you can introduce us , " the man said . " That wo n't be possible , " Eileen said with a terrified laugh . His grip on her arm was firm and she returned it , her fingersp252turning rigid on his hand . She felt the strength of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a terrible urgency that they become lovers . She had never understood this urgency before , which was not physical but spiritual instead : it was a moral obligation upon her , and if she refused this man she would live out the rest of her life in shame . " He wo n't allow you to come in , " Eileen said . " Yes , he 'll allow it . I 'll be inside in ten minutes . Five minutes . " Eileen said in a sudden terror , " I want to explain to you that I love them and I ca n't leave them  --  I love them both and I ca n't  --  " He gave her a shake to quiet her . The front door was opening as if by itself . Eileen 's father stood perfectly straight in his gray summer suit , in his vest , looking out at them . It was clear that his eyes had seen everything , what there was to see and what had not yet happened , took everything in and had converted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . She would have obeyed except that all her strength had gone into this man . Her father 's face was a little dark ; one strand of his hair had fallen onto his forehead . Eileen felt a sudden rush of pity for him and started forward , but the man held her back . " I said come in here . " " I 'd like to introduce myself  --  " Eileen 's friend said , but her father 's look silenced him . " I want Eileen in here . And I want you to get out of here . " Her father took one step out , about to come down to them . He was staring at them with a terrible hatred and groping with his foot , not looking down at the steps . He extended one hand like an old man , groping with that hand too through the rain , and Eileen did not come toward him or move away , but stood paralyzed . " Sir  --  " " You get out of here . Please get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took hold of Eileen'sfree arm . It was meant to be a symbolic gesture perhaps , but it turned out that he pulled at her and Eileen 's friend pulled her back . She closed her eyes to this folly . When she opened them she saw her father rushing forward with a demented look , as if he were ready to strangle the man , and it was with a quick instinctive stroke of his fist that the man struck her father on the side of his head . He fell at once . He fell onto the flagstone walk and his face darkened . She wanted to cry out , Father ! but nothing came . It was as if he 'd drawn out of her that very word , that she no longer had a right to use it . She knelt over him and wondered wildly if he were dead , if he had died so quickly . But his belling struggling cheeks showed that of course he was alive . She seemed to come out of a trance , staring at the man 's mudsplatteredshoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him inside ! Come on , help me . Please  --  " Eileen woke and rose unsteadily . She helped the man lift her father , but bore hardly any of his weight ; the man was really carrying him . He kept saying , " Open the door , please . Please open it , " in a rapid , urgent voice that woke Eileen from the series of drugged little lapses she kept falling into ; it was strange , she 'd never had this happen before . When they finally got him inside the house , on the leather sofa of his study , he had died . Eileen stood looking down at him , uncertain of his death . Her friend lit a cigarette shakily . " He was a pretty old man , you know . He lived a good life . " " Yes , " Eileen said . " It was the sidewalk that did it . He fell hard , he slipped in the rain , " he said , as if instructing her . " Yes , I think I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " He led her out into the foyer and closed the study door . It wasp254the same door Marcey had tried to break down , and Eileen could see the signs of her savage scratches and kicks ; but they were fossils in an aging ruin . In a while those marks would have no meaning . The man was leading her down this familiar hall with his arm around her shoulders , whispering to her . " He led a full life , you know . This was bound to happen someday . " " Yes , I know that . " " You are n't too much upset ? " " I do n't think so . " " We can call the doctor soon . Or should we call him now ? " " I do n't know . I feel a little faint . " He led her to the end of the hall and then walked with her to the front again , comforting her . It seemed now that they had been together a long time , a lifetime . She knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the spontaneous womanly gestures of her soul , everything . She stood in his embrace and put her fists against his chest , weeping gently , like a woman . He led her into the drawing room , whose blinds had not been opened , and she was grateful for the dimness . Was this her room , her gift to this strange man , or was it somehow his gift to her ? He whispered to her , and she wept and laughed nervously and clenched and unclenched her fists against his chest . Upstairs everything was silent . " Do you want me to leave now so you can call the doctor ? " the man said . " Do you think I should ? " " Whatever you want . " " Do n't leave yet , not yet . I 'm afraid . Not yet , " she said . She seemed to blend into him , into the heat of his body . They stood for a while , swaying . Eileen closed her eyes and felt the galloping pace of her heart , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She slid her arms around the man and he moved her to the sofa , which neither saw . The sofa smelled of dust and caution . Eileen gave herself up to this man , and the mask of her face was stripped off between his hard white teeth , leaving a filmp255of pinkish-red blood and membrane , the pulsing of minute and wild veins he might take between his teeth and gnaw . Before he came to her he said , with a man 's impractical practicality , " What about your mother ? " " Oh , let her die ! " said Eileen in a voice of wonder.  |p265She  met him in the cafeteria of the Art Museum , on a Thursday . His name was Draier , Drayer  --  she could n't quite make it out . " Please call me Anthony , " he said , leaning forward against the wrought-iron table , jarring it , and his attempt at intimacy was blocked by the formality of that name also . Pauline 's friend , their mutual friend , had n't figured much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loneliness was leading him  --  he had been reluctant to introduce Anthony to her , she could see that . Her friend 's name was Martin . He had something to do with an art gallery ; his art galleries were always failing , disappearing , and returning again with new names . Pauline wondered if Anthony was an artist.  | " I 'm not an artist . I 'm not anything , " he said . He smiled a sad , quick smile . She was startled by his frankness , distrusting it . He had a striking face , though he had not shaved for several days , his eyes set clearly beneath the strong , clear line of his eyebrows . Beside him , Martin was silent . Students from Pauline 's art class were carrying their trays past this table with serious faces ; their faces , like the work they did , were intense and prematurely aged . " Pauline does beautiful work , " Martin said . He seemed to be talking to no one in particular . " But it 's very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't explain her work . " " Why should you explain it ? " Pauline said . She stood to leave ; she never took much time for lunch . The noise of the cafeteria annoyed her . Formally , with a smile , she put out her hand to Anthony . " It was very nice to meet you , " she said . He looked surprised . " Yes , very nice . . . . " She was out of the restaurant before he caught up with her . Before turning , she heard footsteps and it flashed through her mind , incredibly , that this man was following her  --  then she turned to face him , and her expression was curious rather than alarmed . " I thought  --  I thought I 'd walk with you . Are you going to look at the pictures ? " he said . Look at the pictures . " No , " she said . " I have a class at two . " His face , in the mottled light of the broad , marble-floored hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his midtwenties ; now she supposed he was at least ten years older . His hair was curly , black but tinged with gray , and it fell down around the unclean neck of his sweater lazily , making her think of one of the heads she herself had done a few years ago . . . in imitation of a Greek youth , the head of a sweetly smiling child . ' this man stared at her rudely . She could not bear to face him . " I have to teach a class at two . . . " she said . They walked awkwardly together . Not far away were the stairs to the first floor , and once upstairs she could escape . . . the side of her face tingled from his look , she thought it foolishp258and degrading , she wondered what he thought of her face .. . was he thinking anything about her face ? " Do you live around here ? " he said . " No . Out along the lake . " " Out there ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until now . This was her own fault  --  though she wore her pale blond hair in a kind of crown , braided tightly , and though her face was cool , slow to awaken to interest , held always in a kind of suspension , she wore the standard casual clothes of girls who were artists or wanted to be , living alone , freely , sometimesrecklessly , down here in the center of the city . She wore dark stockings , leather shoes that had been ruined by this winter'sicy , salted sidewalks , a dark , rather shapeless skirt , and a white blouse that had once been an expensive blouse but now looked as old as Anthony 's sweater and blue jeans , its cuffs rolled up to her elbows , its first button hanging by a thread . Her hands were not stubby , but there was nothing elegant about them  --  short , colorless fingernails , slightly knobby knuckles , small wrists . She was anxious to get back to work , her fingers actually itched to return to work , and this man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something invisible but deadly blown into her eye . " I have to leave , " she said abruptly . " You do n't have a place down here ? In town ? " " I have a studio . But I live at home with my mother . " She faced him and yet was not facing him ; her eyes were movingcoldly behind his head . He had no interest for her , not even as someone whose head she might copy ; she had done a head like his once , she had no desire to repeat herself . She felt very nervousbeneath his frank , blunt scrutiny , but her face showed nothing . Like the head of an Amazon on a stand near the stairs  --  a reproduction of an Etruscan work  --  she was vacuous , smooth- ' skinned , patient . From art she had learned patience , centuries of patience . The man , Anthony , was humming nervously under hisp259breath , sensing her desire to get away and yet reluctant to let her get away . " Do you come around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are you so . . . unfriendly ? " He smiled at her , his face grown suddenly shabby and appealing , his eyes dark with wonder . Tell the truth , he was pleading . It occurred to her that he was insane . But she laughed , looking from the inhuman composedface of that Amazon to his face , hearing him say again , Areyou going to look at the pictures ? " Come over here . Can I show you something ? " he said . He took her arm with a sudden childish familiarity that annoyed her . In the noisy confusion of this part of the museum , at noon , she had to give herself up to anything that might happen ; it was part of coming here at all . When she had begun teaching at the Art Institute across the street , years ago , she had brought her own lunch and eaten in her studio , she had thrown herself into her work and that had been , maybe , the best idea . Meeting people down here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially were friends of her mother 's , most of them older than she , a careful , genteel network of people who could never harm her . Down here , the city was open . Anything could happen . This stranger , whose name was Anthony Drayer , whose rumpled clothes told her everything she needed to know about him , now took her by the arm and led her over to a reproduction of another Etruscan work she had been looking at for years with no more than mild interest . " Did you ever see this ? " Anthony said . He was very excited . The piece was a tomb monument , showing a young man lying on a cushion with a winged woman at his side . The man 's hair was bound up tightly , in a kind of band ; his face was very strong , composed . Pauline had the idea that Anthony saw himself in that face , though his own was soft , sketchy , as if done with a charcoal pencil , not shaped vividly in stone . His smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . " Who are these people ? " he said , glancing at her . She saw that his fingers were twitching . Her eye was too intimate , too quick to take in shameful details  --  it was a fault in her . She could not help noticing that the skin around his thumbnails was raw from his digging at it . " I moved down here a few months ago and almost every day I come to the museum , " Anthony said . He spoke in a rapid , low murmur , as if sensing her coldness but unable to stop his words . He picked at his thumbnail . " I like to look at the pictures but especially the statues . You do statues ? That must be expensive , is n't it , to buy the stone and all that . . . ? I could never do anything like this , my hands are too shaky , my judgment is n't right , I ca n't stand still long enough , but I love to look at these things , it makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are those two in love ? Is that why she 's reachingout toward him ? " " No , they 're not in love , " Pauline said , wondering if her tone could rid her of this man forever . " The man is dead . The woman is an angel of death , or a demon of death . You see how her hand is broken off ?  --  she was holding out to him a scroll with his fate written on it . This is a monument to adorn a tomb . It is n't about life , it 's about death . They 're both dead . " Anthony stared at the figures . " But they look alive . . . their faces look alive .... " " Do you see how their bodies are twisted around ? The demon 's body is organically impossible , it 's out of shape from the waist down , and the man 's body is almost as unnatural . . . . That 's a typical Etruscan characteristic . " " Why ? " ? " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare . " The artists were n't interested in that part of the body , evidently their interest was in the head , the face , the torso .... " " Why is that ? "  |p261He  scratched at his own head , at the dusky , graying curls . She could smell about him an odor of something stale , sad  --  cigarette smoke , unwashed flesh , the gritty deposit of decades in some walkuproom . Her own odor was clean and impersonal . Her hands smelled whitely of the clay in which she worked . Anthony looked sideways at her . His look was pleading , intense , threatening .. . for the first time in years she was afraid of another person . " I have to leave , " she said . " Can I see you again ? " She was already walking away . Her heart was pounding . He was calling after her  --  she nearly collided with an elderly man making his way slowly down the stairs  --  she had the excuse of apologizing to this man , helping him , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And outside it ai n't no better , all that goddamn ice , " the old man said angrily , as if blaming her for that too . She escaped from them both . It is a festival of some kind . Mules with muddy bellies and legs ; a young man with a bare chest leading one of the mules . He is laughing . His head falls back with drunken laughter , as if loose on his shoulders . Another man is riding a mule , slipping off into the mud , laughing . Garlands of flowers are woven in the manes of these mules . What is happening ? Women run by . . . their shouts are hilarious , drunken . I see what it is  --  someone is being pulled in a wagon . The wagon 's railings are decorated with bruised white flowers , the man inside the wagon is speechless , his face dark with a look of terror , as if blood has settled heavily in his face and will never flow out again . Now a soldier appears on ap262black horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather of his complicated saddle creaks ... . She woke suddenly . Her head pounded . The dream was still with her  --  the raucous laughter in the room with her , the whinnyingof a horse . She looked around wildly , for a moment suspendedof all personal existence , of thinking , not even afraid . The wagon 's wheels made a creaking noise and so perhaps it was the wheels , not the soldier 's gear , that was creaking . . . . Then the dream faded and she felt only a dull , aching fear . For a while she lay unthinking in bed and felt the cool , contented length of her body beneath the covers , not thinking . Twenty-nine years old , she had a sense of being much older , of being ageless . So many years of patience , the shaping of clay and stone , the necessity for patience had aged her magically ; she was content in her age . Her work was heads . She was interested only in the human head . Out in the street she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their unique , mysterious , miraculous shapes ; sometimes their heads were a threat to her , unnerving her . She could n't explain . But most of the time she brought back to her work a sense of excitement , as if her blood , in flowing out at the instant of glimpsing some rare sight , had returned again to her heart exhilarated and blessed . She felt at times an almost uncontrollable excitement , and she would spend hours at her work , feverish , unaware of time . She and her mother had breakfast together every morning . They ate in the dining room , enjoying its size , undiminished by its high ceiling . The house was very large , very old , a house meant to store collections  --  paintings , manuscripts , first editions , antiques . Her father , now dead , had collected things . The house had become a small museum , but polished and sprightly , ruled by her mother 's bustling efficiency . A woman with a firm place in local society , her days filled with luncheons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to being entertained , Pauline 's mother was that kind of middle-aged , generous , busy woman who becomes impersonal around the middle of her life . She too collected things , antiques and jewels , and kept up what she thought to be an enthusiastic interest in " culture " ; it was something to talk about with enthusiasm . " We 're stopping at the auction after lunch , " she told Pauline . She chattered at breakfast , her rich , rosy face ready for the day that would never disappoint her , being a complicated day filled with women like herself , the making out of checks , endless conversations ... " You look a little pale . Are you well ? Did you sleep well ? " " I had a strange dream , but I slept well . I 'm fine . " " I still think you should give up that job . . . . I wish the weather would change . April is almost here and everything is still frozen , it depresses me when winter lasts so long . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark dress , she wore pearls and pearl earrings ; a slightly heavy woman , yet with a curious grace , a girlish flutter at the wrists and ankles , which Pauline herself had never had . She was in the mold of her father : tall , lean , composed , with a patient , cool kind of grace , never hurried . Pauline had never been able to accept the memory of her father in the hospital after his stroke , suddenly an elderly man , trembling , with tiny broken veins in his face . . . . RITES TO BE HELD FOR PROMINENTFINANCIER , PHILANTHROPIST " Are you sure you 're well ? " her mother said suddenly . " Yes . Please . " They parted for the day . Pauline 's mother approved of her " work , " though she did not like her teaching down at the Art Institute ; she feared the city . She did not exactly approve of Pauline 's clothes and her tendency to wear the same outfit day after day , but her daughter had a profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her friends . Every few years the newspapers did stories on her when she won some new award or had a new show for the art page or the splashy women 's page , the daughter of the late Francis Ressner , with large photographs that showed her standing beside one of her stark , white heads , her own head beautiful as a work of art . There was a certain stubbornnessin both her and in her work . She had very light blond hair that fell past her shoulders , but she wore it braided around her head , giving her a stiff , studied look ; she had worn it like that since the age of fifteen . Her cheekbones were a little prominent because her face was too thin , but she attended to her face with some of the respect for clarity and precision that she applied to her work  --  though she wore no make-up , she kept her eyebrows plucked to a delicate , arched thinness , and she saw that her face was smoothed by oils and creams , protected against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty , pale andunemphatic ; her father too had been a beautiful man . Hermother , florid and conversational , had been startlingly pretty untilrecent years , a perfumed and likable woman , but Pauline was another kind of woman altogether and pleased with herself . Sometimes , in the privacy of her studio , she sat on a stool before a mirror , her long legs stretched out before her , and contemplated herself as if contemplating a work of art . She could remain like this for an hour , without moving . It pleased her to be so complete ; unlike other women , she did not want to turn into anyone else . That morning , entering the Institute , she saw one of her girl students talking to the man she had met the day before , Anthony  --  they were standing just inside the door , and both looked around at her . She smiled and said hello , not waiting for any reply . Her heart had jumped absurdly at the sight of him and she had no desire to hear his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , take hold of her arm . . . . Safe in her class , she put on a shapeless , soiled smock . She directed eight students inp265their own work with clay . She was efficient with them , not friendly , not unfriendly , never called anything except Miss Ressner . She felt no interest in her students ' lives , no jealousy for the girls with their engagement rings and wedding bands . The girl who had been talking with Anthony had long black hair and an annoying eagerness . She had a small , minimal talent , but she was one of those students who want to be told , at once , whether they will succeed or not , whether their talent is great enough to justify work , as if the future could be handed to them on a scroll , everything figured out by a superior mind , determined permanently . . . . And she felt no interest in the men , who were both older and younger than she ; their pretensions , their sincerity , their private , feverish plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , " Miss Ressner , that man was asking about you . Out there . Did you notice him ? " Pauline showed no curiosity . " I saw you talking to someone . " " He asked a lot of questions about you . . . . I know him a little , not well , he hangs around down here in the bars and places . . . . " Then , embarrassed , she said quickly , " But of course I did n't tell him anything . " Pauline felt tension rising in her . She dropped her paper cup into a wastebasket , conscious of spilling coffee in the basket , onto napkins . . . coarse paper napkins that soaked up the liquid at once . . . . It was ugly , a mess . She went out into the drafty corridor . That dream was still with her . . . . She was tempted suddenly to go over to the museum to see if anything there could explain it , surely it had an origin in something she had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules , why garlands of flowers , why a bare-chested victim in a wagon ? Later that day she saw Anthony again . He was standing in front of a restaurant , doing nothing , as if waiting for her ... . She had left her studio , restless , wanting to get away from studentswho dropped in to talk with her . She was too polite to discouragevisits . Why did people waste her time talking to her ?  |p266Why  did they ask her vulgar , personal questions , about where she got her ideas , about whose work she admired most . . . ? Why did people talk to one another , drawn together mysteriously , fatally , helpless to break the spell ? She had sensed , in certainmen and in a few women , a strange attraction for her  --  something she had never understood or encouraged . Gentle , withdrawing , but withdrawing permanently , she backed out of people 's lives , turning aside from offers of friendship , from urgency , intensity , the admiration of men who did not know her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just did not want to be close to them . And now this Anthony , whom she would not have liked anyway , was hanging around her , a dragging tug at the corner of her eye , a threat . Her mother 's first command would be to call the police , but Pauline , being more sensible , knew that was not necessary . It would have been a mistake to ignore him . She said , " Hello , how are you ? " Her smile was guarded and narrow in the cold sunlight . " Hello , " he said . His voice sounded uneven , as if he was so surprised by her attention that he could not control it . " Where are you going ? Would you like some coffee ? " " I do n't have time , " she said , side-stepping him . She felt her face shape itself into a polite smile of dismissal . Anthony smiled back at her , mistaking the smile . . . or was he pretending to mistake it ? Was he really very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suffocating pounding of her heart . He rubbed his hands together suddenly , warmly , as if pleased by her . Today he looked more robust ; he had shaved , his black curls fell more neatly down onto his collar ; he wore a short , sporty coat that was imitation camel 's hair , only a little soiled ; he wore leather boots , cracked and marred like her own shoes . " I 'd like to talk with you , " he said . " It 's very important . " " Not today  --  "  | " But I wo n't hurt you . I only want to talk . " He smiled a dazzlingsmile at her  --  he was about to move toward her , about to take her arm again . She jumped back , frightened . But he only said , " I want to talk about different kinds of living , I want to know you . . . how it is for you , your life , a woman who looks like you . . . . I spend my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bar or in somebody 's apartment , listening to records .... " " I have to leave , " she said thinly , bowing her head . She could not look up at him . " Yesterday , when I saw you , I thought . . . I thought that I would like to meet you . . . . Why does that offend you ? " She said nothing . " I asked him , what's-his-name , to introduce us . He did n't want to . It was very important to me , something gave me a feeling about you , meeting you , I was very nervous . . . last night I could n't sleep . . . . " She stared at his boots . Strong lines and faint lines , a pattern made by the salted ice in leather , ruining it . The pattern was interesting . One of her own shoes was coming apart . . . . What if friends of her mother 's saw her standing here , one Second Avenue , talking to this man ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slouch of his shoulders and the urgent line of his leg , bent dancerlike from the hip , even the stupid cowboyboots , would upset and please them probably : looking like that , he must be an artist of some kind . Stammering , embarrassed , she interrupted him , " I 'm older than you think . . . I 'm over thirty . . . I do n't have time to talk to you , I do n't go out with people , I 'm not the way you think . . . " How do you know what I think ? " he said angrily . His anger frightened her . She was silent . Why was she here quarreling with a man she did n't know ? She never quarreled with anyone at all . She never quarreled.  | " If you 're so anxious to leave , leave , " he said . Released , she could not move . For a moment she had not even heard him . " Do n't run  --  I wo n't follow you ! " he said angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . She had another cup of coffee . Shaking inside . The coffee tasted bad . Everything down here was cheap , her students ' talent was cheap , common , their faces had no interest for her , she could not use them in her work , why was she pretending to need a job ? She should quit . Move her studio out . There were only two genuinelytalented students in her class , both men , and she guessed from their nervousness and the frequency with which they cut class that they would never achieve anything , they would disintegrate . . . other talented students of hers had appeared and disappeared over the years , where did they all end up ? And yet when former students did come back to visit , most of them art teachers in high school , she was unable to show more than a perfunctoryinterest in their careers ; why did people surround her , clamor into her ears , what did they want from her ? What secret ? " He 's crazy , " she thought . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance out on the street , she sometimes felt terror , sometimes a kind of dizzy , abandoned excitement . It was necessary for her to be afraid ; she knew the police should be notified , barriers raised , bars put into place ; yet she wondered idly why she should be afraid , why . . . ? She could not believe that anything might happen to her . She was safe in her composure , her strength , she had been taking care of herself for years , and so why should she be afraid of that man , why should she even think about him . . ? Getting into her car one afternoon , late , she saw him at the edge of the faculty parking lot , watching her . She was tempted to raise her hand casually in a greeting . Would that dispel the dangeror make it worse ? She imagined him leaping over the lowp269wire fence and galloping up to her . . . . She did not wave . She did not give any sign of seeing him . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , faltering steps , after the car , in the street . . . his action was ludicrous , sad , crazy . . . . She wondered if she herself had become a little crazy . Bodies in a field . The field is sandy , a wasteland , but great spiky weeds grow in it , needing no water . The end of winter , not yet spring . The bodies come to life : a man and a woman . The woman has long , ratty hair , the man 's hair is mussed . It is confused with his face . Their bodies are twisted and their faces in shadow . They laugh loudly , waking , they embrace right on the sand , in the open field . . . . Near them is something dead . Is it a dog or a large rat ? Let it be a large rat . Frozen hard from winter , not decayed . . . . In the presence of that thing the man and woman embrace violently , tearing at each other 's skin , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there in the open , among the spiky weeds and the dead rat , aware of nothing around them . She woke with a headache again , unable to remember what had wakened her . A dream ? It was still dark . Only six o'clock . She got out of bed , her body suddenly aching . She dragged herself to her closet , put on a warm robe , stood in a kind of perplexed slouch , wondering what to do next . . . . IIer shoulders and thighs ached , her head ached . Her eyes in their sockets were raw and burning , as if someone had been sticking his thumbs in them . Nearby , on a handsome old table , was a head she had done recently , in white ; the model had been an old man , but very clean , dignified . He had had a light fringe of hair , almost likep270frost , but she had dismissed that and the head was bald , an exactingskull . It interested her strangely . The head of an old man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , the human skull . His forehead was solid , bony , broad . The nose was rather flat , but broad at the bridge ; a strong nose . The eyes were stern , the eyebrows strong and clear , the mouth slightly surprised , but withdrawing from surprise . She had wanted to convey a certain emotion  --  terror , really , but at the same time the refusal to accept this terror , even to allow the surface of the skin to registerit . She ran her hand over the top of the head , over the face . Cold lead . Cold skin . She pressed her cheek against the top of the . head . A completed work . In her bathroom the light was too strong . It was reflected from the cream-colored porcelain of the skin . The house was old but the bathrooms and the kitchen had been remodeled at great expense ; Pauline had never liked the change . She had liked the oldfashionedfixtures with their heavy , exaggerated handles , the mirror beginning to show lead beneath it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without shame  --  and the old , creaky shower , the worn black and white tile . Now everything was new and clean , as if in a motel . It had no history . She peered at herself in the mirror . In a few weeks she would be thirty years old , which seemed to her surprisingly young . Surely she had lived more than three decades . . . ? Yet her face looked very young . It was pale , untouched , soft and baffled from sleep , as if with a child 's apprehension . What had she dreamed ? She took a jar of night cream out of the cabinet and smoothed it onto her face . It was necessary to lubricate her skin , she had to take care of herself . It was a duty . One day , twenty years ago , her father had told her bluntly that she was dirty  --  disheveled hair , socks running down into her shoes . " I do n't want you to look ugly , " he had said . It was a command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striking , beautiful face , andp271that face brought with it a certain responsibility . There is a terribleweight in all kinds of beauty . Skin is an organ of the body . It consists of many layers of cells . No one could have invented it . Cells absorb moisture and lose moisture ; they pulsate in their own secret rhythm , in their own private time . Invisible , elastic . Each human being has his own skin , unique to him . It is a mystery . Someday a dead woman will wear the skin that belonged to a living woman , and it is the same skin exactly . Then it decomposes . . . . The skin is the most impermeable barrier of the body . It is always thirsty . Its thirst is insatiable . Human thirsts are satisfied from time to time , but the thirst of the human skin is never satisfied so long as it lives . She wandered aimlessly through the house . Downstairs , she looked out the window down the slope of their long front lawn , at car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all those people going ? It surprised her to see the cars out there , people driving all night , into the dawn , with secret , private destinations . . . . Something moved out on the lawn . She did not look at it . Then , feeling helpless , she looked at it . . . she saw nothing , only shadow . . . it was not possible that anything had been there . If that man followed her home ? Years ago , a student in London , she had modeled for a class . They were sketching heads , torsos . The instructor had been a peculiar man  --  middle-aged , wheedling , argumentative , but enormously talented , a big man with hairy arms . He had always spilled coffee on the floor , knocked ashes everywhere . Paulinep272had sat there in the center of a circle , motionless . She had never been shy or self-conscious . Her face , protected by its film of impersonality , was invulnerable . . . . The instructor 's name was Julius . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood wrenchingher into shape , turning her face one way , then another . " Remainlike that . Do n't complicate our lives , " he had said . Somewhereon the other side of the silent , working students he had stood , smoking , staring at her . He had a large , ungainly , gracefullyclumsy body . He never talked to anyone personally , he never bothered to look anyone in the eye . She loved him , with rushes of enthusiasm that did not last , imagining him kneeling before her , kissing her knees , in the pose of a certain decadent painting . . . and her staring down through mild , half-closed eyelids at him , uncomprehending . But nothing happened . One day she imagined he was about to embrace her  --  they were alone for some reason in the studio  --  she had an uncanny , terrifying moment when she was certain he was going to embrace her , pressing her face against his , his large hands wild in her hair . . . . But he only opened a drawer and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet air relieved , ready to weep , feeling totally herself once more . Since that time she had thought herself in love with two other men , one of them a painter who still lived in this city but whom she no longer bothered to see , another a lawyer , the son of a wealthy couple in her parents ' set of friends . But nothing had happened . Nothing . She had approached them as if in a dance , she had noticed something in their faces , a certain intense yearning , and she had gracefully , shyly , permanently withdrawn , not even allowing the surface of her skin to register the excitement and dread she had felt . So it had ended . She was complete in herself , like the heads she made , and like them she felt her skin a perfect organ , covering her , a surface that was impregnable because it was so still and cold.  |p273Statue  of Mars .

While the man talked , her eyes darted about frantically . It was still cold . She had forgotten her gloves . Her fingers ached with something more than cold , because it was not that cold . Her friend  --  a married man with four children , a safe man  --  was talking about something she could n't concentrate on when Anthony appeared in a doorway ahead of them . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . Pauline had the strange idea that he had run around the block just to head them off . He was staring at them , but her friend noticed nothing , and as if this were a scene carefully rehearsed , everyone between them  --  studentsin sloppy overcoats , a Negro woman with her children  --  moved away , clearing the view . Pauline and her friend were goingto pass Anthony by a few feet , pass right by him . There wasp274nothing she could do . She stared at him , unable to look away , catching the full angry glare of his eyes , the tension in his head . Cords in his neck were prominent . His coat was open , his hands thrust in his pockets . He glared at her , his glare surrounding her as if the coldness were forming a halo , magically , about her body . The line of his jaw was very hard , his mouth was slightly open as if he were breathing with great difficulty . . . . He jumped out at them , grabbing her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung a knife , the blade suddenly bright and decorative , and slashed at his own throat . Pauline screamed . Her friend yanked her away , but not before Anthony 's blood had splashed onto her . " What are you doing ? What  --  what is this ? " the man cried . Anthony , staggering , caught her around the hips , the thighs , as he fell heavily , and she had not the power to break herself loose from him ; she stared down at the top of his head , paralyzed . In a few minutes it was over . He was taken away ; it was over . Her friend answered the policeman'squestions . An ambulance had come with its lights and siren but now it was gone . " It 's all over . Do n't think about it , " her friend said , as if speaking to one of his own children . Pauline was not thinking about anything . She walked woodenly , looking down at her blood-splattered shoes . Her coat was smeared with blood in front . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see ; she walked stiffly , not bending at the waist , her shoulders rigid . " You 'd think they would catch people like that before they do something violent , " her friend said . Teen-aged girls , passing them on the sidewalk , stared in amazement at Pauline . MAN SLASHES OWN THROAT IN UNIVERSITY AREAAnthony Drayer , 35 , of no fixed address , slashed his own throat with a butcher knife this noon onp275Second Avenue . He is in critical condition at Metropolitan Hospital . No motive was given for the act . TEMPERATURE HOVERS AT 32  --  ; WEATHERMEN PREDICT FAIR AND WARMER THIS WEEKENDWhen she got home , she went right up to her bathroom , avoidingthe maid . Safe . She tore off her coat , sobbing , she threw it onto the floor , and stared at her legs  --  blood still wet on her knees , on her legs , splattered onto her shoes . As if paralyzed , she stared down at her legs ; she could not think what this meant . She kept seeing him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept reliving that last moment when she knew unmistakably that she dare not pass near him , it could not be done ; and yet she had said nothing to the man she was with , had kept on walking as if in a trance . Why ? Why had she walked straight toward him ? She was shivering . In horror , she raised her skirt slowly . More blood on her stockings . On the inside of her thigh , smeared there . It was a puzzle to her , she could not think . Why was that man 's blood on her , what had happened ? Had he really stabbed himself with a knife ? How could a man bring himself to draw a blade hard across his own throat , why would n't the muscles rebel at the last instant , freezing ? She took off her stockings and threw them away . In a ball , squeezed in her fist , they seemed harmless . Blood on her legs , thighs . She stared . What must she do next ? She took a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slept heavily , as if drugged .

The next head , also white , is my own head again . . . my own face . . . the lips drawn back in a look of hunger or revulsion , the eyes narrowed . Can that be my face , so ugly a face ? The fourth head is also mine . White , stark white . A band tight around the head has emphasized a vein on my temple , a small wormlike vein in white , standing out . The eyes are stern and empty , like the eyes in Greek statues , gazing inward , fulfilled . That head is in a trance-like sleep , like the sleep of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if choosing . My hands are itching for work of my own . I can feel the white clay beneath my fingernails , but when I look down it is not clay but blood , hardening in the cracks of my hands . Driving to the Institute , she was overcome by a sudden attack of nausea and had to pull her car over to the side . Now it was April . She sat for a while behind the wheel , too faint to get out , helpless . The nausea passed . Still she did not drive on for a while but remained there , sitting , listening intently to the workings of her body . The doctor stands above me . I am lying on an old-fashioned table , he is holding a large pair of tweezers , his glasses are rimmed by metal , he is bald , the formation of his forehead shines , bumps shine in the light , I am ready to scream but the straps that hold down my legs also hold back my screams . . . . This happened centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctorp277holds up his tweezers to the light and blows at a curly dark hair that is stuck to them . . . the hair falls slowly , without weight . . . While teaching her class , she felt a sudden urgency to get out of the room . She went to the women 's rest room . Safe . She stared at herself in the mirror , seeing a tired , pale , angry face . Dull splotches of the metal that backed the mirror showed through , giving her a leprous look . She recalled a mirror like this in a public rest room , herself a girl of thirteen , pale and scared and very ignorant . She had thought she was pregnant . At that time she had thought pregnancy could happen to any woman , like a disease . Like cancer , it could happen . For weeks she had imagined herself pregnant . Her periods had been irregular and very painful . She struck at her stomach , weeping , she went without eating until she was faint . . . . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking for the five-thousandth time of the terrible secret she held within her , she had felt the first painful tinge of cramps and then a slight , reluctant flow of blood .... So she was not pregnantafter all . . . ? How did a woman get pregnant ? She lifted her skirt again to stare at the smooth white skin of her leg . Blank . Blood had been smeared there , but now it was clean ; she showered every morning and took a hot bath every night , anxious to be clean and soothed and free of his blood . The living cells of the blood , insatiably hungry for more life , flow upward . They rise anxiously , viciously upward . . . in test tubes they may be observed defying the well-known law of gravity . Also , blood splashed onto bread mold will devour it and be nourished by it . Also , blood on foreign skin or fur will harden into a scab and work itsp278way into the new flesh , draining life from it . Also , blood several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will unite with these cells and form new life . At a dinner party one Saturday in April . Her escort was a bachelor , a lawyer . She rose suddenly from the table , trembling , careful to pull back her chair without catching it in the rug , her head bowed , demure , her diamond earrings brushing coldly against her cheeks . Not all the candlelight of this room could warm those earrings or those cheeks . She hurried to the bathroom , she clutched at her head , her face , she realized with a stunning certainty that she was pregnant . She was sick to her stomach , as if trying to vomit that foreign life out of her . On Monday , not wanting to worry her mother , she drove out though she had no intention of teaching her class . She parked around the university and walked for hours . She was looking for him , for evidence of him . Her breasts felt sore , her thighs and shoulders ached . She knew that she could not be pregnant and yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After hours of walking , exhausted , she called a cab and went back home , abandoning her car . She wept . " I just found out about Drayer , " Martin said , stammering . " They said he cut himself and attacked a woman , and I knew it would be you , I knew it . . . . " Pauline was silent , holding the telephone to her ear without expression . " I knew something like that would happen ! He was very strange , he never appreciated what I did for him , he was forgetful , like a child  --  he was always forgetting my name and he had no gratitude  --  he was like a criminal  --  I would never have introduced you but he insisted upon it , he said he could n't take his eyes off your face  --  I knew I shouldn'tp279have done it , please , do you forgive me ? Pauline ? Do you forgive me ? " She hung up . A woman in a stiff brocade dress , wearing jewels . Evening . Candlelight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , my aunt ? She opens the window , which is a door , and a large dog appears . It is a greyhound , elegant and spoiled and lean , with a comely head . The woman takes hold of the dog 's head in both hands , staring into its eyes . The dog begins to shake its head . . . its teeth flash . . . foam appears on its mouth . . . . I turn away with a scream , slamming my hand flat on the keyboard of a piano : the notes crash and bring everything to a stop . Her mother was packing the large suitcase with the blue silk lining . Weeping , her mother . Her back is shaking . A friend of her mother 's talks patiently to Pauline , who lies hunched up in bed , rigid . " If you would try to relax .

" You understand that you can not be pregnant and that you are not pregnant , " the doctor says . He shapes his words for her to read , as if she might be deaf . She feels the foreign life inside her , hard as stone . Bleeding from the loins , she aches with cramps , coils of cramps . The blood seeps through the embryonic sack , not washingit free . How to get it free ? She has a sudden vision , thoughp280she is not sleeping , of a tweezers catching hold of that bloodswollenlittle sack and dragging it free . . . . Dr. Silverman , a friend of her father 's , visits her in this expensivehospital . He talks to her kindly , lovingly , holding her stone fingers . He is a very cultured man who , having lost most of his own family in a Nazi death camp , is especially suited to talk to her , arguing her out of madness and death .

What do children care about the monuments of the world ! They throw flowers at one another . . . . Atop the monument is a statue , two figures .

The girl was slight and had the frail powdery look of a moth , a colorless fluttering insect of some sort . It was embarrassing that her mother was so solid and horsey ; in fact the girl , Doris , called her mother " the horse " behind her back with a kind of smirking , satisfied affection . The boy , Alexander Jr. , spoke of his father as " my father " and to his father 's face he said , " Father . . . . " They kept meeting all their lives , in and around Lakeshore Point . He went to a boys ' school and she to a girls ' school and their friends overlapped , though neither of them really had " friends " ; they had new and old acquaintances . It was an achieve/ment that they had both lived for so long in Lakeshore Point , because it was a suburb people moved in and out of constantly ; it was a surprise , in April , how all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cfore houses , in time for a quick deft selling in a day or two , a few weeks of arrangements , and the move to the next city and the next suburb as soon as school ended . So , in the midst of all this coming and going , the loading and unloading of great Allied Vans that proudly conquered the continent , sooner or later Doris and Alex would have fixed upon each other , at least for a while . As Doris grew older  --  she was now sixteen  --  it occurred to her that the atmosphere of a typical school dance was the atmosphere of life itself . Partners went out to dance , the music changed , partners came back , switched around , danced again , and the gymnasium would be filled beneath its fluttering strips of crepe paper with the shuffling of legs and feet and the movements of arms : so many bodies . It was like this in Lakeshore Point itself , with strangers always moving in and strangers moving out . They were different types : Doris was popular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds who are sure of being overheard . Alex was faintly stereotyped , liking chess and astronomy and complicated crossword puzzles his mother could not understand . Prepared for Harvard , he had been deeply wounded in his senior year at Lakepoint Boys ' Academy when his application at Harvard had been rejected . He had the usual extraordinary grades , and his hobbies  --  chess and astronomy and , at an adviser 's suggestion , ice hockey  --  had seemed good enough . It was a mystery , his rejection . So he would be going to the Universityof Michigan in the fall , and he walked about with his stoop more pronounced than usual , muttering in reply to greetings , casting away imagined slurs with a nervous wave of his hand . When the other boys bothered to think about him , they thought he was rather queer . Everyone had an opinion of Doris Moss , even at distant high schools , but Alex was n't up on any recent news ; he and Doris had gone to the same orthodontist severalp284years before and he remembered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided firmly to become a doctor and to go into medicalresearch , and somehow his rejection from Harvard was not believable . He carried this rejection about with him everywhere , anxious to drag it out and admit it , humble , questioning , nervous in the hope that it had all been a mistake and he was accepted after all . He was the kind of boy adults believed they could talk to , until they talked to him . His parents ' friends approached him with stiff , helpful smiles . He had decided to go into medical research because his father , a doctor , was in a kind of medical research himself . One evening when his parents were having a dinner party Alex had heard something that impressed him strangely and changed his life . He had come in from a movie  --  he always went alone  --  and used the downstairs guest bathroom , in the back of the house . There was something about this bathroom he liked . It was done in black and gold , with decanters of scented soap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small exquisite guest towels that were white linen with gold embroidering . On the dressing table was a delicate mirror , balanced for the fine-lashed eyes of his parents ' lady guests ; underfoot was a black , black rug . Alex liked to use this bathroom because he felt very special in it . He felt like one of his parents ' guests . Before parties he cautiously checked this bathroom , by himself , since the maid was always harassed and could not be trusted to see whether the soap was clean or not . The special soap in this bathroom was ball-shaped , gold and white , and it gave off a lovely sweet scent . But sometimes the soap balls grew dusty because they were never used . This feeling for the bathroom was important , because it might have had to do with Alex 's decision . He was in there when he heard his father and another man come into the kitchen , and his father 's grave words were somehow mixed in with the scent ofp285the toilet paper and the soap . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex operation . You do n't have a neat laboratory situation , of course . You must consider the environmental factors  --  the humidity , the wind , the area , the particle size , the amount of saturation , the method of ejaculation . You can imagine the variability there . " The other man , unknown to Alex , said something about computers . " Yes , computers are certainly helpful , " Alex 's father said in his kind , serious voice , " but beyond a certain point only the existential fact is real . Nothing else is real . An event happens only once and that 's the difficult thing about life  --  it is n't a laboratoryexperiment . " Alex was strangely agitated . He admired his father and feared him a little and it seemed that each of his father 's words was valuable . His father worked for the government now on classified projects and it was sometimes necessary for him to be gone for weeks at a time . Perhaps these long trips or the isolation of the laboratory had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if holding them out at arm 's length ; so it was intimate , hearing his father talk like this . Above the clinking of ice cubes his father said , " The biological cloud agent is a totally new frontier . It 's fascinating work . You have to think of it as disease control in reverse , breeding pathogenic organisms that we 've usually thought of in rather negative terms . And then , apart from the physical reality , there is a totally unexplored area of psychological reaction  --  what the bonus effect in terms of enemy panic might be , we do n't know . We have some ideas , that 's all . " Alex remained in the bathroom after they left . He kept hearing his father talk about " reality . " His father 's other words rose and circled in Alex 's brain , and he could not quite understand them , but again and again the word " reality " returned to him . What was real ? What was real ? " Beyond a certain point only the existential fact is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to understand that concept . It was strange that he could bep286so quick at school and so slow , even dense , around the house . It as as if his father gave off a kind of glimmering cloud that ogged up Alex 's glasses and also fogged up his brain . Inspired , he wrote a theme for his English teacher , Mr. Godwin , called " Precisely What is Real ? " Mr. Godwin was very pleased with it and read it to the class , embarrassing Alex immensely . Mr. Godwin , though not so tall and handsome as Alex 's father , was a minor , substantial hero in Alex 's life . He was a raspy , enthusiastic man with nicotine-stained fingers . Though Doris was younger , she was more experienced than Alex . For years she had been a child and she recalled those years with a kind of disbelief . Then , one summer , she had stayed with a girl friend at Cape Cod and met a boy who was supposed to be a television actor , or had hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people who ran it that you never saw and had no idea existed ; they were the people who really counted , he said . He had a narrow , darkly handsome face and might have been fifteen or twenty-three . There was something indeterminate about him , as if he were waiting to be instructed about himself . " The people that run things are off to the side . Hidden . You do n't see them , you stupid guys at home , " he said with a sneer . When they were together on the beach it was like a television scene . He was always close to her , with the head-on , slightly myopic look of actors on television ; he seemed also to be saying words he had used before . Doris had a fragile , freckled look and a rather thin body . He had forced her to take an icy cold shower with him on the first night they met , and since then her body felt faintly unreal , tingling and numb at the same time . Her body held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , her mind wanted to break free but could n't , her body retained this daze  --  it was nothing she could explain . She did n't talk about it . What she remembered about the boy was his face and body and hands and especially his words , which were strange . " On television there 's all these people running around you neverp287see , and cameras and stuff . You stupid bastards at home do n't know anything . You do n't know how things really are and even the people on television , that work for it , they do n't know either . It 's too big . " Though what he did to her was no different from what other boys were to do to her when she returned to Lakeshore Point , she could not get over his words . There was something forlorn and angry in them , something violent . She kept hearing the violence in them , replaying the words in her head , and her body had that vague , suspended feeling about it , numb and excited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday-morning ritual of shopping . Doris shrank from anyone seeing her with her mother , and her small , closed , sleek face and her rather pigeon-toed , arrogant step quite clearly distinguished her from her mother . Her mother had a long , kindly face ; it was unfortunate that her two front teeth were prominent . Doris ' parents were both rather homely and sturdy ; Doris was lithe and quite a surprise . While her mother chattered about nonsense in the stores , Doris dreamed of what he would be doing that evening on her date , and about whether she gave a damn if the boy called her again . Alex 's mother knew Doris ' mother slightly . Both belonged to the Village Women 's Club . Doris ' mother had inherited quite a lot of money and seemed to apologize for it with her big , toothy , hesitant smile ; Alex 's mother , coming from a less wealthy background , was therefore sharper and knew whom to befriend and whom to slight ; she always avoided Doris ' mother . Sometimes she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother galloping along enthusiastically in short , squat , thickheeledshoes , and the girl dressed like a little slut in a short skirt . At such times Alex 's mother called out , " Why , hello , Edith ! " and breezed on by . Yes , she thought with an involuntary satisfaction , that girl what's-her-name did look like a slut.  |p288She  had her own problems with Alex . Though he was eighteen , his skin was still awful ; it was a pity to look at him . Every Saturday she packed him in the car and drove him all the way into the city  --  and she hated the city  --  to a really superb dermatologist who played squash with her husband at the AthleticClub and who administered to poor Alex X-ray treatments , dried-ice treatments , a variety of pills and hormones , and numeroussalves . Poor Alex had to wash his face with a white sponge and work the lather up and then rinse it away , using only lukewarmwater . No hot water . Acne was caused by overexcitation of the oil glands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must not make things worse . She thought the word acne was at least as ugly as the problem itself . It always startled her to see her own son  --  such a tall , gangling boy !  --  come out of the doctor 's inner office and into the waiting room , with that apologetic stoop to his shoulders , that half-chagrined , half-challenging smirk , and that terrible bluish-violet acne all over his face  --  It fascinated her in a way . It was lumpy and flaky at once . Some pimples were very hard , like berries ; others were ripe and soft and draining . Sometimesit was all she could do to keep her hands off his face , but no , no , one never squeezes these problems away ; nothing so violent . After a good lathering and a good tepid rinsing , Alex applieda special ointment to his poor bumpy face , and it was also a shock to come upon him late in the evening  --  that tall , thin boy in his pajamas looking for food downstairs , his face covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he walked . Poor Alex . In the spring of his senior year in high school , something began to happen to him . He lost his appetite . He walked about mumbling to himself , arguing over something . His father was in Washingtonfor most of April . His mother had a number of teas and luncheons ; Alex felt vaguely protective , knowing that his mother dreaded to be alone and that loneliness was increased by this constantround of parties , and yet he was uneasy with such knowl/edge and did not know what to do with it . Should he have such an understanding of his own mother ? Was it proper ? Though he was forbidden by Dr. Lurch to eat chocolates , he ate them secretly , like a twelve-year-old . When his father called , every eveningat eight , he made sure he was not around , though he would have liked nothing better than to talk to him . He felt dizzily as if he were becoming a child again . . . . His mother began to plead with him . Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class ? Then what was wrong ? Why was he so argumentative ? Why did he so hate to change his clothes ? His underwear ? Ah , his mother pleaded with him ! Alex knew that he was becoming strange but he did not understand it . He felt a peculiar resistance to taking showers or baths and he disliked brushing his teeth because . . . because in this way was n't he stirring up germs . . . ? But he did not want to think about it . " What will your father say about this ? " his mother cried . She was a pretty , dismayed woman . Every day she rose at seven-thirty and showered and put on excellent clothes , all the required paraphernalia of a woman , including high-heeled shoes ; every day she went out at about noon or twelve-thirty to have luncheon somewhere or to play bridge or to do something , Alex was n't sure what  --  she was tremendously and wonderfully busy . On the other days her friends visited her and she served luncheon  --  chickenor shrimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a delicate icy fruit dessert  --  and Alex loved the very odor of such days , the rich promise of his mother 's happy life . He did not want to disturb her . It would be a disgrace for any son to disturb so happy and busy a woman , and yet . . . he felt that there was indeed something wrong with him , some dissociation from his body , a fear and a distrust of his own skin . For Mr. Godwin he wrote an unassigned essay called " The Limits of Reality . " It was long , rambling , and feverish . He wrote it late at night and was quite proud of certain sentences : " The natureof disease may well be the ultimate reality , and the methodp290of survival in adjustment . Isolation and adaptation . Living with disease . Nothing can be repeated . History comes and goes . There is nothing but the Existential Fact . My skin is a dense , swarming sea of maggots invisible to the eye . . . . " He handed the essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening he went to a party against his wishes , at his mother 's wishes . She was concerned about his " social life . " It was a party for high school kids at the big Payne house , and he was probably invited only because his mother played bridge with Mrs. Payne , no other reason . He spent most of his time eating , scooping up dip with his finger . He ate a lot of shrimp . In the recreation room  --  which was long , with a low , stucco ceiling and a great fireplace at one end , without a fire  --  couples were dancing in the darkness . Alex half-knew everyone there and disdained them . Betty Payne had been rude to him , which meant she had been forced to invite him . So he stayed by himself and his face was fixed with a knowing , philosophical smirk as he ate shrimp . There was a commotion in the recreation room . One girl , dressed in white , stamped on the floor and threw herself about in what was either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , flung her arms around violently , let her long hair fly out about her face  --  from the way others were watching her , Alex decided it must be a tantrum . The girl had a thin , delicate body and her legs were quite thin ; it was Doris Moss . She was associated with a crowd Alex had been aware of for years , without taking any real interest , having heard of their perpetual adventures and daringevery Monday throughout high school . He had heard a numberof things about them but did not exactly believe everything he heard . The girl Doris continued stamping the floor in her shiny white low-heeled shoes , exactly like a child , and a boy shouted something in her face . She whirled around and stalked out of the room and came right to Alex . " Hi , Alex , how are you , " she said in a tauntingp291voice . " Let 's go for a ride and get out of here . Do you have a car ? " " I walked over . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was wet with perspiration and strands of hair stuck to it . A few kids were watching her , but Alex ignored them . " Come on , come on , " she said in a husky , flirtatious voice , tugging at Alex 's hands . " Let 's get out of this place before I suffocate . " He followed along with her , both surprised and pleased . She kept touching him with her small , darting , nervous hands and he wondered if perhaps a new self might rise out of him , a new Alex , popular and assured . But she said as they left the house , " Why do n't you have a girl friend ? " This hurt him a little and he did not reply . " Are you queer ? " she said with a happy stamp of her foot . She leaned around and laughed up into his face . " There 's my car . It 's boxed in , " she said , pulling at him . " No , do n't look in that car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? " They got into her car and she managed to get out by driving over the lawn . She had to back up and drive forward a few times , impatiently turning the wheel , and she finally managed to get out . Alex watched the doorway of the house for someone to appearand shout at them , but no one came . " Why do n't you have a car ? Why do n't you have a girl friend ? " " I do n't know . Do n't want them . " Her brisk , brassy manner was good because it expected nothing of him . She talked so fast and so loudly that she hardly listened to him . " No , really , tell the truth for once , " she said , pokinghim in the ribs , " is it some religious thing or something ? The way you act ? " He had been drinking at the party , but it had not released a freer , bolder Alex . Instead he felt hot and nervous . As Doris drovep292along the boulevard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alexander Junior ! " she said with a snicker . Then her mockery changed to a kind of fake sugary concern . " Your father 's kind of cute though . I like your father . Why did n't your father come to this lousy party tonight ? " She drove carelessly and kept jabbing at him and teasing him , and Alex wondered if this was the usual way for girls to behave with boys ; he did n't know if he liked it or resented it . " Tell me what you 're doing these days , " Doris commanded . " Are the braces off your teeth ? What 's wrong with your skin ? Tell me about your father . Tell me something , say something , " she laughed . She let her head fall back and her mouth opened1 blankly . On her delicate ears tiny earrings glinted ; Alex likedthem . He was glad he had found something about her to like . " My boy friend pierced my ears for me . This was someone you do n't know , some bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First you get it clean and then you put a piece of cotton behind the ear , you know , to protect that  --  you know  --  that vein or artery or something that 's there  --  but anyway it bled a lot  --  My mother gave me these earrings for Christmas . " " They 're very nice . " She reached over and seized his hand . " Do you like me , do you think I 'm beautiful ? What are you thinking right now ? " " I have sort of a headache .... " " I 've got this crazy idea , it 's a great idea , there 's this little kid I 'm going to take for a ride . Let 's take him for a ride . On Sundays people drive up and down the lake shore with kids on rides , looking at the lake , so let 's go get him , all right ? " There were flecks of saliva around her mouth . Alex , staring at her , felt his head begin to ache seriously and wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving fast and carelessly . She turned off onto a darker street and raced along it , not stopping at intersections , and after a while she braked the car to a fast stop before a ranch house . Alex sat in the car , bewildered , and she ran out.  |p293A  few minutes later she appeared at the door of the house , backing out , and then she turned and ran down the walk with something in her arms . It was a baby . " Look . This is my brother Dorsey 's baby . Look at it . It 's my nephew . What do you think , I 'm an aunt . No , let me drive , I want to drive , " she said rudely , though he had only slid over to look out at what she held . It was a baby , yes . " What 's that ? " " What 's it look like ? " she laughed . " I told the kid inside , she 's in seventh grade at Cooley , I told her we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ride . It 's sort of a nice baby . Here . " Alex did not want to hold the baby , thinking he was not good enough for it , would n't know how to hold it , would frighten it . But she thrust it at him and started the car again . " But maybe we should n't  --  " " Oh , shut up , " she said . The baby began to whimper and Doris snapped on the radio . " This is a lousy car . This is n't my car . This is Fred 's car , Fred Smith , do you know him ? Of course you do n't . " " Fred Smith ? " " You do n't know him and you do n't know anybody . Ca n't you stop that baby crying ? What kind of a father are you ? " Alex rocked the baby experimentally and it did stop . He felt a kind of numbness move over him , as if he were indeed a father , and the frantic perspiring Doris who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared down at the baby in awe . " Fred 's this guy I have kind of a thing with , he 's real wild . He 's real strange , he 's from Olcott . He does n't hang around with any bunch . This is Fred 's car that he lent me for tonight , I was at his place and drove it over , my mother thought I was at Toni Sargant 's . There 's a slumber party there tonight . She thinks I 'm going there but I 'm not . " " Where are you going , then ? " Alex asked suspiciously . He held the baby as if in accusation of her , rocking it gently.  |p294The  girl cast a sideways glance at him . He could not figure out her wild chatter , and then he remembered suddenly talk at school about certain kids who took pills ; Doris had been mentioned . He saw at once that of course she was high . She had a strange waxen look beneath the perspiration , a dummy 's look . Seen in ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenwith a slightly snubbed nose ; in the changing , disruptive lights from the drive-in restaurants and gas stations they were passing she looked as if her skin had been painfully tightened around the blunt hollows and ridges of her face . " We 'd better go back , " Alex said . " This Fred is awfully strange . He lives by himself , " Doris went on . A car approaching them flicked its lights and finally blew its horn to urge her back onto her own side of the street . " I said I 'd be back around twelve but I got hung up with someone , that Tommy , but he made me mad . . . and Fred will get mad , but . . . but I do n't know if I 'll go back to his place . . . . I do n't know . I should get his car back or he 'll be mad . I took a bus over to his place but that was during the day . . . but if I go back he 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . He 's twenty-four . " " Doris , we 'd better go back . Let 's take the baby back . " He felt a little sick . Doris had driven out quite far and was in a dark , dinky suburb now , rushing along the main street . " I want to get to the country , " she said angrily . " I 'm so sick of all this , I could puke . We 've got a cottage up north we could go to , nobody 'd know . My brother Dorsey , he 's a goddamn show-off , he 's really my stepbrother and he 's an awful lot older than I am . I do n't remember him , really . That might not have been his house . I think it was . I told the babysitter my sister-in-law wanted the baby and she believed me , and I 'm pretty sure it 's the right baby , my nephew . His name should be Walter . . . . Is n't that a stupid name for a baby ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if startled by her remark . Alex stared helplessly down at it and felt , once again , a magical sensation of being its father : the two of them besieged by the cruel , crazy words of its mother . He wondered suddenly if there might not be some danger of their infecting the baby . His hands were very large , holding it ; his skin looked dangerous and flaky in the mottled light . " I know what , let 's play a trick on Dorsey . Let 's fix him , " Doris whispered . " What ? " " Let 's kill it . " " What ? " " The baby here , " Doris said . " Is n't that a wild idea ? Huh ? What do you think ? " She stopped the car . She leaned over to Alex and stared down at the baby 's face ; Alex leaned away from her . " We could let it drop out of the car by accident . We could say it got out by itself . Some other car would hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . We could stuff that blanket in its mouth , what do you think , is n't that wild ? What do you think ? " Alex 's head was pounding violently . " You 're crazy , " he said . " Who 's crazy ? " " You , you 're crazy . Why do you want to do a thing like that ? " Doris laughed and laughed at him . Oh , he was absurdly intelligent ; he 'd never get over it any more than he 'd get over his acne . Doris lay back against the seat laughing until she began to sob angrily . Alex stared at her . " You want me to drive back ? " he said cautiously . " Stupid bastard like you do n't know how to drive , " she muttered . She said nothing more . Her stare was fixed upon something before her , on the dashboard , maybe . Or on nothing . Her mouth opened upon rapid , jagged gasps . Once in a while she giggledp296convulsively and Alex waited , frightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll drive back , " and Doris made no resistance when he squeezed over her and got behind the wheel. 7 He drove back to the Payne 's house and parked in the circle driveway and walked home by himself , terribly frightened . His fear was a kind of intoxication , and he could not think straight . Later he was to hear that the police had been called , that the baby did belong to Doris ' brother , and that Doris had been found unconscious in the car ; the baby was crying on the seat beside her . And who was to know that Alex had been involved ? He told no one about it , no one . His father returned from Washington and had a talk with him . He was a serious , handsome , busy man and it was a serious matter that he take time to talk so lengthily with Alex . He talked about being normal . " Do you think it 's normal , " he said , " to hoard your dirty clothes ? Not to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not bothering anybody , " Alex muttered . " Your mother says this is getting worse . It 's getting worse . And what about this essay you wrote ? " Mr. Godwin had called Alex 's father about the essay . It was no surprise ; Alex should have known better than to write such a thing . What is reality ? Reality is germs and microbes and infectiousscum . . . . As he listened to his father read these strange , angry words , he was torn between a knowledge of their insanity and a hope , a terrible hope , that his father would glance up at him with respect . But his father held the paper at some distance , reading , his mouth working the peculiar words as if they themselves were infectious . Finally he said , " Do you think this is the work of a normal mind ? " Alex broke down at that point . He confessed to his father about the terrible odor of his skin , the infection of his skin , the sensation of crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itp297was terrible , it was terrible , and his voice rose to hysteria ; he began to claw himself . " It 's all over me , I tried to keep it secret but it got worse . I do n't want it to fly off or anything . . . the X-ray treatments help , it is n't on my face . . . it needs to be burned off , not stirred up , that 's the danger if I fool around , I do n't want it to get stirred up and go off on other people . . . . " " What 's wrong with you ? What are you talking about ? " his father demanded . His father showed no fear ; he was calm and logical , and Alex tried to imitate him , though his skin became cancerous with germs as he spoke ; so active , so restless ! His very skin crept upon his bones and his scalp moved of its own accord . " I think it could be treated but I do n't want to miss school , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , I know it is n't normal , and I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Please do n't tell Mother or she 'll worry about it . . . . " So he was taken by his father to Dr. Mate , a friend of his father 's from Harvard Medical School . Dr. Mate was a psychiatristwhose practice consisted entirely of disturbed adolescent boys . Alex 's problem was judged not a serious one because it did not threaten violence , and it was not even an uncommon one : a neurosis induced by feelings of Oedipal aggression further stimulatedby a sense of inferiority and frustration . He clawed at himself , in the opinion of Dr. Mate , because he could not claw at his father . Still his " problem " did not go away . After many sessions with this doctor , who reminded Alex of his own father , Alex was made to understand that it was his mind that was sick and not his skin . They arranged for him to spend some time in a hospital called Oakridge Manor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to tell the other patients his secret about his skin being infected and seething with germs . Oakridge Manor cost sixty dollars a day but was worth it , everyone said . After a while Alex 's father transferred him to another private hospital , Foxridge Manor . He was allowed to come home on weekends . He liked these visits home but he was unable to relax ; he carriedp298himself about cautiously and stiffly through the familiar rooms , his own former room , the lovely guest bathroom downstairs , and when he spoke , it was in a cautious , stiff voice . His mother talked to him about the way the living room was going to look when it was painted and the drapes changed . " But why are you sitting like that ? You can let your arms rest on the table , please , Alex , do n't sit there like that  --  you know you 're perfectly all right , please , " his mother said . " Yes , I know . That 's right , " Alex said . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . " " I 'm sorry . I know there 's nothing wrong with me . " She rushed on to talk about the painters ' union and the terrible fight a friend of hers had had with a painter . First he had painted her friend 's dining-room walls white , and then apparently he had leaned on them with his dirty hands  --  and so the walls were blotched and smudged  --  and what did he think ? What did Alex think happened next ? Alex said vaguely , " Out at the hospital the other day there was a girl I thought I knew . She was sitting in the reading room . She was leafing through magazines very fast . There were little scabs on her fingers , it looked like , as if she bit her fingernails , but . . . but maybe there were n't scabs , I did n't get that close . . . . I thought it might be Doris Moss . " Was it ? " " I do n't know . " His mother said slowly , avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris . Of course I do n't know anything about it . But some boy beat her up . Some man . He beat her up very badly a few weeks ago in some awful place downtown . It was such a shock . " " Then what happened ? " " To her , you mean ? I do n't know . " She was staring at Alex with her blank , flattened-out look , a pretty , dismayed mother who had seen too much and thought about too much , who had been des/tined for a life of luncheons and dinners and the fulfillment of a good marriage and the enjoyment of a successful son . . . and instead , this had happened . She stared at him . " She did n't die or anything ? " Alex said . " I do n't think so , no , she did n't die . I do n't know what happened to her , " his mother said . The telephone began ringing in the next room . " That 's the contractor with the estimate , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent moment she rose and went to answer it and Alex heard her in the next room talking about the living-room walls . They were to be painted either white or oyster . That was the conclusion of their talk about Doris Moss , and the subject never came up again.  |p300The  AssailantThere are those strange , ugly times when your body seems transparent , your skin drawn too tight , something , so that the heightenedbeat of the heart and the minute hissing of blood through veins seems a concern not just of yourself but of everyone watchingyou . I knew this once but had forgotten it ; sitting in the hospitalwaiting room , I am reminded . Outside the hospital , past its bright green lawn and immaculate swept sidewalks , people are walking without this knowledge . It is spring , May . Why should they bother with this knowledge ? If they glance at the hospital , it is a glance that does not sharpen , but scatters their thoughts ; for why should they be reminded of the transparency of their bodies under their handsome clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious , among the other people who wait , of being truant from something . Years ago I would have felt guilty at being out of school . Now , what am I absent from ? At this time of day  --  ten-thirty in the morning  --  everyonebelongs somewhere . We are those who have been selected out of ordinary routines because something has gone wrong . We are conscious of a mistake somewhere . Those we have come to visit are being propped up with pillows , tubes are being adjusted in them , blood pumped into their indifferent arteries : who knows what magic is being performed ? The nurses are young and healthy and professionally impersonal . They know secrets of the kind we out here can not be trusted with . Our bodies would refusesuch knowledge . It is kept from us behind walls . When we leave the hospital and hurry out into sweeter air , they will tend our secrets for us and keep us from thinking . And , later , when our loved ones are dead , or recovered and free like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My friend sits beside me knocking ashes into the stained ash tray . It has a floor stand and is made of metal with markings to suggest wood ; its early , flashy brilliance is marred by rust spots . Bargain basement . A wad of pink gum with tiny tooth marks in it lies in the ash tray ; fortunately , it is the kind of gimmicky ash tray you can manipulate into opening , so that the gum falls through and disappears . My friend glances at me after he does this , but I have looked away . Impossible to keep up the strain of love if we share such things . . . . When I look back at him the gum is gone , he has recrossed his long legs , he smiles tentatively at me . Time for the visit . My friend remains seated . He avoids the nurse 's gaze , and the unlegal , unofficial nature of our relationship is advertised . He and I are nothing to each other , nothing that can be filed away . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I follow the nurse along the corridor . The foyer must be a recent addition , for the floors and walls there are handsome . Asp302soon as you leave the foyer , the dingy , rather damp hospital itself begins . . . they have no dignity , disease and death . There is here the paid-for anonymity of county buildings with their clerks and counters , the anonymity of certain police stations and public libraries at the very centers of huge American cities . Dying must be easier in these gray impersonal surroundings , for their dimly white walls and chipped bedposts and noiseless wheeled carts have nothing in them to suggest a world to be envied . Or do I say this to myself to keep from feeling terror ? The nurse walks ahead , in rubber-soled white shoes . All the money he pays , and what is so good about this . . . ? I try to be grim and practical ; my father could admire no qualities in me except these . And here , suddenly , he is . Propped up by pillows as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imagined . He is still stunned and baffled . He is old . We think of our fathers not as they are but as they appeared to us one day  --  when we were ten , maybe , and everything was vivid and uncomplicated . We have no heart to think of them as they are , as if that were a betrayal . " He likes the sunlight . He was sitting up for breakfast , " the nurse says . She is pretty , with brown hair . In spite of her white uniform and the sure , practiced look of those hands accustomed to death I think of her not as a function of the hospital but as a woman  --  someone my friend , waiting back there with the old rumpled Time Magazine , might find pleasing to look at . " Please do n't tire him , " she says , as if he is her father and not mine . I sit by the window , in a wicker-backed chair painted pale green . The hospital room is smaller than I remembered . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this death and dying , there is suddenly no room for the economical eye that charted us for so many years . The old man in bed watches me attentively , as if I might make a sudden movement . His eyes are still intelligent , though his face and body are wasted . Or are they intelligent ? That is the sort of thing one carries back from the hospital , ap303little half-whispered remark to be made to friends who want to hear it . I sit and talk to him , leaning forward . I am aware again of my body as if it were transparent , and of the urgent set of my spine . What is that on his table ? Something made of rubber , redbrownrubber ? Everything frightens me . I talk on and on , about relatives , about the lawn at home , about the squirrels that dig holes in the lawn , about the man down the street with the annoyingdog . . . . If some of these topics are familiar , good . My father wants to be told only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed his body and ruined his speech has done no more than point up what he has always been  --  but I am not allowed to think that . Something hurts my throat . I am not allowed to think such things of the dying . I talk on . I am bright as the sunshine coming through the curtainlesswindow , bright as the cheap handles of the drawers in the metal night stand . It occurs to me that I have blundered into the wrong room and am talking to someone else 's father . Good , good . Someone then is in my own father 's room , chatting away as if no one ever lived or died or suffered , but as if the horizons of human life were cleanly circumscribed by neighbors , relatives , dogs , the latest news from . . . friends thought forgotten , or friends of friends never really remembered . " Aunt Thelma 's neighbor , that one , you know , that won the car in the raffle , well , they went down to Florida with it and guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am dutiful and pleased with myself , to report such a thing . If only I had more misfortune to lay quietly on his bed ! But his stroke was brought on by someone beating him  --  an unidentified assailant . " Unidentifiedassailant . " They are not sure if he remembers this or not , so I should not make any reference to violence . Automobile accidentshappen only to those who deserve them : he always felt that , obscurely . So I can talk about automobile accidents . But anything else may be bad for him : flowerpots falling accidentallyp304out of windows onto innocent heads , children accidentally drowned in ditches , " man accidentally electrocuted while workingwith television set . . . . " That unidentified assailant ! I wonder , while I talk cheerfully to my father 's wrinkled , mute face , what that assailant is doing now . My father breathes quietly . Does he resent my body , transparentas it is ? Marked for an assailant as it is ? He can not help but narrow his eyes at my talking mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence . He must begrudge the life he gave me ; perhaps he is even bored with me . I am bored with the self he inspires in me . And as I fall into guilty silence , with a faint strained smile on my lips , I think of the more desirable self others inspire in me and of how that has alwaysdetermined my love for them . As soon as I hurry back into the foyer and my friend glances up at me , another self will appear ; this talkative self , this daughterly-maternal self , will be left behind with the antiseptic odor of the hospital . Another self ! Of all absurd things , I catch myself trying to see my reflection in the hard shiny surface of the metal stand . And yet I do love this man sitting motionless in bed . I love him , but we are paralyzed with each other . He is dying and I am living , and customarily , like people speaking different languages , we are fearful and bored in each other 's presence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painfully , he tries to speak  --  he can not speak . Nonsensical sounds come from him . I listen with my spine urged forward in that foolish way , a way I have just learned . Never have I sat like that before coming into this room . I listen ; I frown ; I stare at the floor . Nothing . I love him but can not tell him so , for as soon as I said the word " love , " that word would have no meaning . What little trinkets and souvenirs can we give to people on their way to die ? At the end they must toss everythingcontemptuously aside , the way we clean out attics and drawers of things that belong to other people . Afterward , my friend and I drive out toward the country , awayp305from the hospital . It is nearing noon , evidently . People are out for lunch . At a school crossing my friend has to wait impatiently while a woman with a white band around her waist and chest holds up a sign that says STOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without interest . Negro and white children . They are energetic and vicious in the spring air ; careless of color , they mingle , and their blows are delivered brightly , without discrimination . The woman lets her arm fall wearily . My friend  --  whose face in profile is hard and has the illusion of being chipped , so deep is the cleft between the lips and chin  --  drives on . We stop before reaching the country at a park I 've been in a few times : a grade-school picnic once , I think . A fairly large park for the city . People are playing tennis on the courts as we stroll across the ragged grass . My friend is smoking a cigarette as if this were an offering to me  --  some normal distraction , something for him to do instead of talk . Like all men who are conscious of their bodies , the breakdown of someone else 's body is an obscure embarrassment . He has never met my father and never will  --  my father would have hated him and he my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deference to that unknown man 's suffering , he frowns and pushes his sunglasses up , unnecessarily , on his nose . We watch the tennis players . An Oriental boy dressed in white shorts , his chest bare and tanned . Marvelous , graceful strokes ; a flash of triumphant teeth . His opponent wears dark slacks and looks uneasy , though he plays well . " I used to play tennis all the time , " my friend says . " I won secondplace in a tournament once  --  just a city tournament . " But this saddens me , because though he is a young man , his tone refers to something far in the past . We walk on . On another court two girls are playing . Two women . They are poor players , but happy ; we hear one call out to the other . My friend 's teeth must be bared in an angry smile , for he hates the display of anything graceless . Once when I pulled myp306skirt up a little and side-stepped a newspaper fluttering down the street at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like some kind of bird ; like a swan ? Only in flashes does he reveal himself . As if we are following a map , we pass the tennis courts and some disorderly picnic tables and go into the woods . Here the paths are wide and rutted with bicycle tire tracks . The woods is thin ; we can see traffic moving through it , out on the other street . Because we are very new to each other , everything is dreamy and tentative . He puts his arms around me and kisses me . I feel somethingagainst my back  --  the rough bark of a tree  --  and we say nothing , for we do not know each other well enough yet to be friends . We have nothing to say . In silence , like this , we are actingout a frayed drama that will be repeated this evening , right here , and the knowledge of our impersonality excites me . I love him , I think , though with my eyes closed I can not remember what he looks like exactly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reality in his embrace than in the mysterious , abstract relationshipsbetween fathers and children , fathers and daughters . . . . Then I understand : here is the assailant . " Unidentified assailant ! " He is in my arms , and out of a mechanical urgency I caress his back , for is n't this what is always done ? My father 's assailant , with his rigid , critical profile and his mouth that is too soft and demanding , both at once , and his unidentifiable body pressed against me . He is the only honest person I have met . He is imitatingnothing . Before the honesty of his passion everything lacks substance : the wearying sympathy , the hospital corridors that only seem to lead in one direction , the rooms with television sets droning inside , the nurses , the father enthroned in his last shrine , mysterious and vague with his appliances on the table or in the drawer , hidden , or in some nurse 's care , ready to be switched on and switched off . If my friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , for he so insists upon his truth  --  he is not a liar now . Only at this time men do not lie and are immortal . I want to say , " What did you do to him ? Why ? Why did youp307jump out of that doorway and beat him ? What did you use  --  a hammer ? An iron bar ? Why did you pick him , that particular old man ? " He draws back from me . His face is enough for me to love . My anxiety is not for him or for any nuances between us , but only to get everything over as quickly as possible  --  we will drive over to his apartment . We will drive over there at once . How tired I am of this transparency , and how I want to take on the innocence of passion and hide myself ! " What about him ? " he says , for as he shakes aside the violence of passion some forlorn human memory touches him ; he will becomea liar again . He lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaint , offered freedom . His eyebrows rise . " I mean , you 're not going to . . . get upset , are you ? " he says . " You 're not going to get upset ? "  |p308The  Heavy Sorrow of the BodyIt was nearly noon and for hours they had been carrying boxes and bundles up to the apartment . There was a kind of chaos about them , a gaiety in their words and caresses , and only when the moving was finished and things lay all about them , on the floor and on the bed , did they sense the completeness of their action . Here they were . They were together . With so much junk on the floor , the rooms looked smaller than they had . There were two rooms and a bathroom , at the back of a large Victorian house that had been partitioned off into apartments . A casual , half-pleasant disorder lay about the place , an air of the domestic and tolerant . The kitchen window looked out upon a wild , scrubby back yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drooping clothesline between them . The clothesline was empty . Across the back way was a factory with soot-darkened windows , and behind that were other factories , great ugly buildings inside wire fences . Smoke of various hues poured out of the smokestacks and rose sluggishly into the air . . . . Nina and Conrad stood at the window , looking out . They were silent , now that the exertion of the moving was over , and they were settled , the two of them , in these rooms . Nina believed she could smell the poisoned air seeping in to them . But Conrad said , " Do n't be silly , you ca n't escape it . Why try to escape it ? Everything is poisoned , everything is polluted .. . live with it , forget it . " They turned to each other out of habit . The habit turned to joy , it was automatic ; they loved each other very much , and their ' love was bright and sharp , it took them by surprise . Nina was always surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him entirely , and when she was apart from him she thought about him . . . about his meaning to her , about his body , for it was his body she loved and his body that possessed his soul . She loved his soul , she loved him passionately , as if under a kind of enchantment . Yet , in his embrace , entangled together and very warm , accustomed to the clumsiness that always came with love , Nina could sense the still , silent chaos of this apartment they had for some reason chosen , which was waiting to be straightened out and made normal . A normal apartment , normal people . And she sensed the larger , more silent chaos of the vacant lot outside the window and the factories that ringed the city , a heavy poison not to be escaped . " Yes , live with it . Transcend it , " Conrad said . They got up and began to put things away . Conrad 's books , ten boxes of books . The boxes were from a neighborhood grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Conrad 's battered books were stacked in them , fallen over , ripped , watermarked , broken-backed . . . . Nina had ap310sudden presentiment , in looking at this mess , of how he would treat her . She sat back on the bed and lit a cigarette . Conrad continued with the books , impatiently . He had blond hair that fell in jagged streaks across his forehead , and his neck was strong and rather muscular . Did he look thirty-five ? But he was thirtyfive . In this context  --  the cheap apartment and the avalanche of books , the torn cardboard boxes , the clothes still on hangers thrown hastily across other things  --  he had a sharp , squinting , youthful look : he looked maybe twenty-five . And Nina . . . Nina was not his age , she was slightly younger . And she looked younger . There was a lazy , ironic , calculating expression about her , even her hands shared this expression ; she was very thoughtful . Yet her thoughtfulness often broke into laughter . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " All this crap represents my life . It 's an accumulation of my life . It 's myself , you might say , it 's me . " Nina talked nonsense to him while he worked . She liked to lie back on beds and sofas , stretch her long lovely legs , and smoke and talk . She smoked and talked all the time . Did he understand how she loved him ? She wanted to know . Did he understand what it meant to her , to give up Peter in that manner , to make Peter unhappy ? Never , never had she wanted to make Peter unhappy .... " The hell with Peter , " Conrad said . He wiped his hands on his thighs . He wore only trousers , no shirt . No shoes or socks . She looked with amused interest at his filthy feet . With Conrad in her life , everything became dirty . She herself was a little dirty . She was no longer really a girl , she was a woman , and yet she lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Did he know how she loved him ? " You do have a certain weakness , " he admitted . He had a self-assured , strong face . Yet he himself was notitp311strong . His life was confused and energetic and without purpose . Now he was studying history , and his intention was to be a historian . He believed that historians had always lived in the past ; he had his own theories about history . In his lifetime , which seemed to belong partly to other people , he had at one time wanted to be a musician and he had wanted once to be something ordinary : a businessman , a lawyer . He had wanted to lead people . A leader of minor causes , dedicated , arrested , marked for execution by his own men . . . . People told Nina about him , warning her , but she would n't listen ; she said , So what ? She had fallen in love with him at a party . She loved to talk , and it turned out that Conrad loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours , sharp , bright , hilarious , sarcastic . . . . Nina had sensed that they would become lovers and her excitement made her mean , brought her lazy deadly sarcasm to the surface ; later , when they were lovers , he would understand . It was a duet , a duel . They had been loving each other already in this way . When his books were stacked on the shelves , in no particular order , Nina rose to help him with the other things . She picked up several hangers with clothing on them . It shamed her a little , to have Conrad see her dresses hanging like this , as if they were disguises , costumes , colorful skins of herself . " Ah , look at this , look at this , " Conrad said in disgust . He held up an old suit of his , royal blue , very rumpled . " My life is a wreck , " he said . It was true that his clothes were bad , they had no style , nothing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face had hard , rather prominent bones at the cheeks and forehead . He looked military and Teutonic , with blond eyebrows and blue , ironic eyes . His body was a little muscular , or had been muscular once . On his chest and stomach were curly blond hairs with a glint of red to them , and over most of his body was a light , soft fuzz or down . Nina had never loved a man the way she loved him . Each man had raised her higher , buoyed her higher in love ,  |p312and  at the very highest point Conrad had turned to her and said , " You 're Nina . I 've heard all about you , Nina . I know all about you . He had n't known all about her but he wanted to know . He wanted to know everything . Walking along the street for that first week , curious and eager and a little impatient , he had asked her about her life . She was a beautiful girl and he had n't known beautiful girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be beautiful ? And Nina shrugged . " You feel no hostility from other women ? It does n't bother you ? " Conrad asked . But Nina said no , why should she care about other women ? She did n't care about other people at all . Being beautiful was all she had known for years , it was just an accident of her skin and nothing more , she accepted it . " But you take care of yourself , you fix things up , eh ? It is n't all nature , is it ? " Conrad wanted to know . Nina said that no beautiful woman lets her face go , it 's just habit to keep it up . Cold cream , astringent , certain medications . . . . Why not ? " The kind of men who make love to faces would pay you a lot , " Conrad said . " You 're worth money . But me , I 'm different , it 's the soul I make love to . . . . Is your soul shaped like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she felt him already moving upon her body , claiming her . It was joyous to walk with him . For a week she held him off , she talked about nonsense in her amused , ironic , lazy voice , making him stare at her , making him fall in love . She felt his desire for her . There was a strange , nervoushappiness between them on these walks before they were lovers , with the thought of her dear friend Peter somewhere behindthem , betrayed , and who knows what friends of Conrad 's ?  --  for that heavy , hearty face and that muscular body must have had a cosmic experience behind them . Nina had n't been beautiful all her life ; the miracle began when she was about twenty . She had a healthy , vexing beauty . I-Ier hair was brown and she wore it pulled back in a large , loose knot ; her eyes were steady and clear , always a little ironic , andp313her lips were rather small , rather sweet . Out of those lips anythingat all might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-legged stride on the street and she wore striking clothes , often slacks , so that people stared at her without really seeing her as a person . They stared at the effortlessness of her , at her look of freedom . Conrad himself like to stare at her , assessing her . He had the cool , transfiguring look of a sculptor , eying material . She complained that he was always looking at her and thinking about her as an object , and she wanted nothing more than their union  --  a continual closeness , a magical intimacy . They argued in an off-again , on-again manner ; their arguing was a series of hard caresses . " But beneath it we understand each other , " Conrad liked to say . They drank beer in one of the neighborhood bars , or lounged around with friends in someone 's apartment , drinking , or they strolled hand in hand through the dreary city park . " I do n't want a woman who 's always pushing at me , putting her ear against my chest to hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're like a man yourself , though of course you 're very womanly  --  but still you have that quality of being yourself  --  your own person  --  that these other bitches do n't have . " But she was immune to the flattery of words , it meant nothing to her . When she was in love , she needed no words . She did n't need assessments , mythologizing . She liked to lie in bed with Conrad until late in the morning , the two of them lethargic with love and affection , two good friends . She wanted to be his best friend , not just his lover . She demanded it . Was she his best friend ? " I do n't know you that well , " Conrad said with his usual frankness . On certain days she got up early to report for her job  --  she was a substitute teacher in the city 's public school system . It was n't much of a job and she was a woman designed for the domesticity of love and men , but still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk on and on to Conrad in a voice that sometimes rose with lyricism and then sank with despair , mock despair , telling him about that day 's classroom and itsp314peeling walls , its dirty windows , its heat or its cold , its thirty-five or forty Negro children in such colors , like a flower bed : red sweaters , blue shirts , pink dresses , polka-dot slacks . . . everything . Conrad would sit and listen , staring at her . Perhaps he was trying to envision her life as a teacher , at a job , apart from him and independent as a man . " No , start over , " he would say . " Be more precise . What did they ask you ? What time did you get in ? What happened ? " And she would lie back and smoke , and tell him about the teacher in the next room , a battered old manwoman , identity unknown , who cautioned her about catching something ... lice , maybe ? An infectious disease ? She told him about the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the pipes that went crazy and started a dance , bucking and jumping six inches at a time , so that all the kids laughed and she , Nina , gave up and laughed too , though she knew well enough that the pipes might explode and send jets of scalding water over them all . And what else . . . ? The crazy lessons . What a crazy place it was , what a crazy system , Nina laughed . In one class the kids told her that she was number three that week . It was a fifth-grade class held in one dingy corner of a very old gymnasium , whose other corners were occupied by other classes , and she was number three that week . " Christ , you mean the third substitute they had in a week ? The third ? " Conrad said . Teachers came and went , recruited out of anywhere , they wised up or were frightened out , or , in sheer muscular reaction , fled after a half day . Oh , Nina had to laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the kids swore they had been studying Mesopotamiathe day before , other kids swore they 'd been reading about the American Indians , still others were scared and blank and malicious . Totally lost . A bobbing class of Negro kids , a long-legged white teacher , a woman , bemused and ready to have them read about anything from the big soiled " history " book the system forced upon them , something like a catalogue of photographs advertisingother parts of the world . The other parts all looked bet/to than this part . China 's exports , China 's rivers . Trade routes . Latitude and longitude . Wars , enemies . Allies . Great religions . If they mixed it all up with long division and the Iroquois and the Pledge of Allegiance and Mesopotamia she was sorry , she was really sorry , but what could she do ? Let them read out loud from the big book . Let them take turns . Time would pass . The day would pass . " I really think you feel guilty about this , Nina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't convincing . But look : it is n't your fault that it 's all shit . " She agreed with him . She did n't want to feel guilty , she did n't believe in guilt . Anyway , she had n't time for it . When she and Conrad had met , she was trying to break off a relationship with an earnest , dour , intelligent young man of Slavic descent  --  oblongheaded , with glasses , unsparing in his criticism of all failures except his own , really a nice person . She could n't stand him . At first she had drifted into loving him , in that mild maternal way women love men when they are really " between " men but need someone around , need to keep in practice , and Conrad was the end of that . Peter was going to be a success as a professor , give him time , he had just received his Ph . D. and was off to teach at a small Catholic college  --  he said he needed Nina , but Nina could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you have marriage in mind ultimately , " Conrad said , " maybe you should stick with him . " He was being frank . Nina listened to him frankly . " You know how my life is , " he said . " I ca n't even think of marriage , the first time was enough , ' . . . . I 'll be paying her off the rest of my life and I do n't have anything to pay her , it 's hell . So if you want marriage and a house and all that , it is n't too late to get Peter back . " Oh , the hell with Peter , Nina said , the hell with respectability and security and dull , deadly niceness ; what she wanted was Conrad with his dirty feet and his profanity , even if he was a bastard . She gave them a year together , one good year . Conrad showed surprise at this . " Ip316ca n't imagine anything that temporary , " he said . " I 'm really monogamous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage repelsme , the papers and the blood test , and it does nothing for love , and . . . . But a year , Nina ? Only a year ? Surely you give us more than a year together ? " They took an apartment together a few blocks from Nina 's old place , in a Victorian horror given over to mysterious tenants  --  bachelors of various ages and sizes , working girls with bright blotched faces , a lady who wore gauzy white gloves every day . Peace , a desperate privacy . Even the odor of gas from downriver was peaceful . It took them all morning to move and all afternoon to put away their things , scolding and teasing each other . There was something very pleasant about working together . Nina felt quite gay ; she picked up one of Conrad 's books , The MagicMountain , and asked him about it . Was it about magic really ? Was it about a mountain ? Conrad said , " It 's a beautiful novel about the decadence of Western civilization . Lovely ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is man ?  --  man is water , mostly , and cellulose . Are you made of water and cellulose , my dear Nina ? " This offended Nina . She tossed the book onto the floor and turned away from him . She was really offended , it was unlike her . " What 's wrong ? What is it now ? " Conrad cried , trying to embrace her . They struggled . In his bare feet , Conrad danced around her , clowning , though he was thirty-five years old and would soon be thirty-six , indeed he would soon be forty-six , and still he was Conrad and still he lived in such rooms . " Dear Nina , beautiful Nina , I did n't mean anything insulting . . . if you 're water and cellulose , such cellulose has never been seen before , it 's enchanted , I could write a book about it ! " Slowly , out of habit , their bodies twined together . They embraced . They were friends , though perhaps not best friends , they were in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's accomplished , if we die now we 're that much to the good . . . .  |p317Danger  was all about her . She was thirty now and lazily she knew that something ought to shape her life , some form should arise , she should get a permanent job and take up with permanentpeople , good citizens , stop this sluttishness , get her eyes examinedfor glasses . . . . We 're that much to the good , she thought . If they remained together for a single year , it would overcomeher brain to assess all the love that would pass between them , all the energy used up , prized . She liked to lie beside Conrad , the two of them in a pleasant , heavy stupor , and with her curious hand touch his face , his neck , his chest , all the parts of his body , examining him gently , as if trying to re-create him for the inner , blind Nina who saw nothing but felt everything . When their passion spent itself out , she still returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of their love : it was so intense , surely they were more than water and cellulose . How could water and cellulose perform such miracles ? She touched the hard strong muscles of his thighs , wondering why he had muscles there , why , since he never did any work ? The mystery of his being was not explained in his body , but it lay deep inside his body , in himself . It was not in his private keeping , not in his knowledge . She felt that , as a woman , there was no mystery in her , but everything was simple and opened simply as a flower ; it was in Conrad the mystery lay , in his strength . She loved him . I Ier love for him ran round and round in a circle as she touched him , not quite caressing him but only touching him , examining him with her fingertips . " Ah , Nina , " he said , " you 're not like those other bitches . . . . " That evening someone knocked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusion but Conrad only said , annoyed , " Who 's out there ? " It was a girl , a friend of Nina 's from her old apartment building . She was embarrassed and , to explain everythingfast , held out an envelope to Nina . " It just came special delivery and the man knocked at my door . It must be important , so . . . so I came over , I 'm sorry to barge in here like this . "  |p318Nina  took the envelope , staring at it . Conrad said , " No , that 's all right , how do you like what we 've done . . . ? Tomorrow night we 'll have everybody over . . . . Where 's that letter from ? " Nina had turned away and was reading the letter , a single sheet of white paper . " I do n't think it 's from Peter , otherwise I would n't have brought it over , " the girl said . " It 's from out of town . " They stared at Nina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " It is n't bad news . . . ? " Conrad said . The girl left . Conrad tried to put his arms around Nina , awkwardly . " What is it ? Something from home ? " She handed him the letter angrily . It read : Dear Nina , I am writing this letter for your father . He is very sick and would like you to come see him . I am sending this letter to the address he has here and I hope it reaches you , since your father is very badly sick and would like to see his daughter . The signature was a stranger 's signature , very clear and feminine . Conrad said , " What the hell , is it a nurse ? You said your father lived alone , did n't you ? " Yes , he lived alone . Nina was very angry . She went to the door and opened it to look down the stairs , as if wanting to call her friend back , and then she went to the back window . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , he was a strange man and had never cared much for her , and she had n't cared for him , and now . . . now he was dying and what the hell did he want with her ? " How do you know he 's dying ? " Conrad said . But she was n't going to go . She began to walk wildly about the apartment , pulling away from Conrad . No , she was n't going to go . She raved angrily about that letter , the summons to her father and his death , which was a stranger 's death and had nothing top319do with her . She hated him , she refused to remember him . At the age of seventeen she had left home , glad to get out , and for two years she had lived with a bitch of an aunt and she 'd made her own way , everything in her life was her own and she needed no one else . She did not remember her father . She hated him , his sickness and dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man dying . He was a stranger to her , he was nothing . They were all strangers to her , and she could not even remember them . She drove Conrad 's car up north , a bruised , dented old Buick that looked like a small boat , with fins made for an element thicker than air . She resented the long drive , her body already querulous with being alone , apart from Conrad . Her body , by it self , was a little nervous and did strange things  --  she kept wanting to stop at a gas station and use the rest room , she was anxious and jumpy as a child , and yet these stops were not really necessary ; her body was just playing tricks on her . The absence ofConrad was very real . It was oppressive , frustrating . She did not think about her father , waiting ahead . Unlike her friends , Nina never bothered to talk about her parents . She had forgotten them , she 'd gone beyond them . She was really free and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were really not . Her mother had died years ago , freeing Nina , and her father had receded with his queer life of handyman , town gossip , everyone 's friend , an emharrassment . She recalled him as a fairly young man , with a head of thick brown hair , wearing overalls , telling jokes . Her father ? I le could have been anyone 's father . For the last six or seven years he had lived alone in a cabin on a lake . The lake was an adequate lake , not one of the more famousp320ones in the northern part of the state , but there was a fairly good tourist trade . The cabins around the lake were rented or owned by city people to whom her father was a handyman , a watchman , a protector . He lived all year round on the lake and watched over everyone 's cabins for a fee . In the summer he fixed things . I le had such a " mechanical touch " ! So her father had turned out to he a handyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . It did n't embarrass her because it meant nothing . Driving up to Lake Fredonia , she saw with distaste the roadside archery outfits and miniature golf courses and drive-in movies and restaurants  --  all of this new since she 'd lived with her parents in a small city nearby . She disliked the sleaziness , as if it somehow degraded her father 's illness . And she resented this illness , drawing her so far north , away from Conrad and the warm easy intimacy of their life together . She began to see the cabins that lined Lake Fredonia , pressed close together . Cheap , standard , bringing an urban look to the country , marked off by narrow driveways and mailboxesout of Sears , Roebuck . Which one was her father 's . . . ? She knew with an instinctive revulsion that his would be the ugliest , the worst of all , a wreck . It was early May now and no one was up here , but out of one cabin chimney smoke was rising thinly  --  her father lived there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weber was also her name . She drove up the bumpy , muddy driveway and stopped . An other car was parked nearby , a junker , probably her father 's . The lake was very bright and drew her eye to it at once . Slashes of sunlight bobbed on its surface , it was uncanny in its beauty , and she stared toward it until her eyes began to narrow , as if such beauty was another kind of degrading , an insult to her father 's suffering . The shore was pebbly and not very clean . The land sloping down to the lake was untended , just scrubland , and the cabin was not too bad  --  bad enough , but not exactly a horror -- made of nondescript wood and propped up on blocks . Next doorp321was a sleazy cabin with yellow siding and a stretch of beach that was pebbly and strewn with unidentifiable junk . And , on the other side of her father 's property , was a newer , larger cabin painted bright pink . Pink , in this setting ? The color was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pink ! Lake Fredonia ! As a child she 'd come out here with other kids and swum off the rough beach , ignoring the No Trespassing signs . She and her friends were always being chased away down the beach . Get home , get out of here , did n't they know this was private property . . . ? And now her father had sold or maybe lost the old house in town and had moved out here , a handyman , a keeper , and he had his own forlorn stretch of beach that kids from the town probably invaded . Nina was home . A woman was coming out to meet her . Yes , this was a nurse . Nina stared at her , at the woman 's set , tidy face . She got out of the car and introduced herself . They shook hands . In spite of herself , Nina felt her eyes searching this woman 's face , leaping to her eyes . She had to know , suddenly she was desperate to know the truth , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for day after tomorrow , " the woman said . " And I thought . . . that is , he wanted . . . he wanted to see you before . . . " Nina stood flat-footed in the mud . She listened to the woman 's drawling , dutiful voice and tried to attach herself to it . Was this really happening ? What did it mean ? An old man was going to be operated on , and Nina was his daughter ? For the first time in years she felt a dull stirring of fear . She was suddenly vulnerable . The nurse apologized for not being well herself . A cold . She indicated her reddened nostrils , pink rabbit 's nostrils . The nurse 's manner was becoming more deferential as Nina stood without speaking , with the power of silence . Nina 's beauty awed her . That was something Nina took for granted , and while people stared at her uneasily she was free to think , figure a way out , a solution . . . she 'd gotten through bad times that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in miserable classrooms , her first fewp322good-byes to men . She could count on her beauty to impress peopleas brains . They went inside . Nina was not prepared for the odor of the cabin . Was it her father , that odor ? Or the odor of his sickness ? He was lying propped up in bed , with a heavy quilt over him  --  the quilt looked maternal , warm , domestic , crisscrossed with black and red stitching , very nice . Nina was glad for that quilt . Then father and daughter looked at each other . Nina , ashamed of herself , came to him and took his hand . What could she say to him ? Desperate , her mind raced . But her father said , " Nina . Thank you for coming . Thank you , " and his feebleness was dignified ; still her mind raced . She chose her words as if from a distance , listening to them : " Hello , Daddy . I got your letter . . . . How do you feel ? I drove right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stilted . They might have been talking across a dangerous distance , a chasm . Her father 's mouth worked slowly and as he spoke she did not look at him , not yet . She had n't yet looked at him closely . Her mind was in a daze , captivated by the quilt and its look of suffocating warmth . " I was worried and I drove right up . . . . " The nurse said something to Nina about a coat . She remembered that her coat was still on , buttoned up , and she took it off and lay it over a chair . At home now . Dressed in a black sweater and plaid slacks a little tight , with a hard knowing deftness about her that did not settle into the eyes of her father and the tired nurse . Nina at home . With her father , transformed into an old man in bed . . . an odor of flesh and mustiness about him . . . and he insisted upon talking slowly and painfully up into her frightened face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it was all right . " " Got your own car now ? " " I borrowed a friend's. "  | " Sort of lost touch . . . . You seen this place before though ? " " I do n't think so . " " Yes , sure . " " Maybe I did .... " " This was Meyer 's place . Meyer . He went to Florida . I bought it from him . Been here ever since , taking care of things . . . real nice here , private all winter . Nobody around . In the summerthere 's lots of work . All that wood outside is firewood . . . . " She still had n't looked at him . His talking mouth took up all her attention . Was he in pain ? What was wrong ? The illness that had brought her hundreds of miles to him was a secret , somethingnot to be mentioned . Yet it was real . Her father talked about Nina 's relatives , dead and distant , about people whose names she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on and on , and she answered him with short rushes of her life , maybe lies and maybe not , she hardly knew , and none of this was as real as the sickness in his body and yet they could not acknowledge it . " In the winter there 's not a sound . Nowhere . Not a sound , " he said . Later , when her father slept , she walked outside with the nurse , Mrs. Stocker , and the banal secret was told . " It 's a tumor he 's got , you know that , it 's one of them down here , " the nurse said with a clumsy embarrassed gesture , halting the gesture at once so that Nina did n't really have to look . But she knew , she supposed she knew . They walked on the planks that led out along the driveway , protecting their shoes from mud . They were very much together , Nina and Mrs. Stocker , mulling over the old man 's sickness and his dying , trying to think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically . Nina was n't a woman with much memory , no interest in memory , and yet she began to wonder automatically about death , arrangements , a funeral , a burial plot . . . . and would the grief be much ? Already she feared the grief . It was crazy , all this happening , her standing upp324here in a cold May drizzle with a registered nurse , Mrs. Stocker . A stranger . They had stopped talking . Mrs. Stocker was waiting for her husband to pick her up . Having nothing else to do , Nina waited with her . The cabin was cozy and dirty . She did n't mind dirt . She was even relieved to see it because it meant time , years , days gotten past  --  grime on the walls , on the refrigerator door , grease spots on the ceiling , food stains , smoke stains . An accumulation of a life 's dirt . While her father slept , she looked around . There was a storeroom off the main room , into which a beaten-up sofa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were newspapers and magazines on the floor ; in one corner were rusty hunting traps with chains tangled around them . Everything abandoned , forgotten . She came back to her father to watch him sleep . He had become a small man . His hair was no longer thick and brown but very thin , ratty , and his strangely elongated skull shone through it . But his skull was n't really elongated . It was an ordinary skull , an ordinary head . Nina sat and watched him sleep , her mind jammed and yet strangely at peace . He would sleep . And they would operate on him . And then , whatever happened , she would leave . Mrs. Stocker came back early , before seven . Nina made coffee . Her father 's best time was in the morning , obviously . He tried to sit up and he made unnecessary , slightly bullying demands  --  Mrs. Stocker made a clicking sound with her tongue and teeth , but Nina said , Yes , why not ?  --  hunting around in the back room for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took her half an hour to find a map , but it was n't the right map . Her father wanted to talk about the lake . " Real estate is high as hell here , " he said . " You got any extra cash , invest it here . Right here . This place I bought , it was seven years ago , you know what it cost ? " Nina had no idea . " Two thousand . Now its worth three , four thousand . I bet you.  |p325He  was a small tidy vessel , contracting in upon itself with pain at certain unguarded moments . Easing back , trying to relax , Nina began to see him . His face was lined and slightly pitted . His eyes were dull , as if covered with a film of intense concentration ; he had to talk . Nina realized that everyone had to talk . The ambulance was coming for him that afternoon . Knowing this , they circled the topic , alluding to it , united by their helplessnessand pressed onward toward more talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina took up the burden of their conversationand began to tell him about her life . She was a substituteteacher . It was hard work , but very exciting . . . once there was a colored boy of twelve who had drawn a picture of her . . . a strange , filmy , but rather beautiful picture , drawn in crayon by a retarded Negro boy . . . and she had been very pleased . . . . " Do you live near the colored ? " Mrs. Stocker asked politely . " No . Yes , " Nina said . Then Nina 's father had to go to the bathroom and he tried to lift himself out of bed , using the strength of his arms and shoulders . Mrs. Stocker hurried over . " No , no , " she said loudly , as if speaking to a deaf baby , " do n't you strain yourself , Mr. Weber . " Nina stared at the porcelainbedpan Mrs. Stocker took out of somewhere . It was strange that she was not repulsed by it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the eerie relentlessness of the moment , ready to begin again the slow offering of talk that was her only gift .... She recalled having gone with this man , her father , somewhere in a truck . In those days they lived in town . The truck had been a pickup truck and she had gone along with him to the lumberyard  --  she must have been about eight  --  and her father was at that time a solid , muscular man with a permanent tan and permanent stains of nicotine and grease on his fingers . He liked to joke , he had a loud , hearty voice . At the lumberyard he had beguntalking with someone , and time passed while Nina wanderedaround alone , peering into the hot , sunlight-striped depthsp326of the buildings , smelling the sharp odor of lumber . Time passed . She went to sit in the truck , dangling her legs out the door . She wanted to go home , she had to go to the bathroom , she felt a sudden pang of fear that her father had forgotten her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat in the truck , right out in the sun , feeling the heat swell about her , miserable , waiting , too proud to run to the door and say , Daddy I have to go home . . . . Perspiration had broken out on her father 's face . He must have been suffering , but the pain was held inside him , a secret . She felt a reluctant admiration for him . Then , when he lay back , relaxed , his face drained white with pain or terror , she lit a cigarette and began to talk quietly again . She slipped back beyond the stories of her life in the city , her teaching , her years at college , and began to root around in the memories of her childhood : he had shared those memories with her , as an adult . And yet he did not seem to remember . He listened , his face serious and frail , and he nodded , but clearly their pasts did not quite coincide . She might have been making up stories for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what had happened to the Latham boys , the twins . . . ? It seemed very important to her now . But her father could not recall those people . By the time he was taken to the hospital , Nina was herself exhausted . He was brought up to his room in a wheelchair . Anotherman , another old man , was in this room and his bed was near the window . Nina stared at him bitterly . She did not want him in this room with her father . Stubborn and frightened , knowing she was wrong , she tried to find the doctor . Where was he ? What kind of a place was this ? She talked to the nurses , complaining . She wore lemon-colored slacks and a bright silk blouse , and her hair was pulled back loosely from her face . The energy of her body and the authority of her face seemed to be failing her here . She understood that she was not properly dressed.  | " What are you going to do to him next ? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be given an injection at four . " " And what else ? Anything else ? " " I 'm going to wash him a little . . . . " " No , I 'll do that . I 'll do that myself . " Nina 's teeth were nearly chattering , she was so nervous . She was frightened . In the hospitalroom , with its deafening white walls and its basiny white odor , her father looked forgotten already . " I want to do that myself , " she insisted . They set up a screen around the bed , of white gauze through which one might look . But no one would look . Nina 's father was humble in this new setting . From time to time he stared at the length of his body beneath the thin covers , his eyes protruding slightly , a habit of the old that means . . . that perhaps means I am emphasizing this moment , for no reason . Nina took the sponge from the nurse and began to wash her father . Her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had an angrylook . Her father 's body was uncovered and it was a man 's body , but there was something half real about it , as if it were the body of an unformed man , a child . The washing took some time . Nina drew the large white sponge over her father 's body slowly , as if she were moving it across him , blind , seeing with her fingertips . She had the idea that his skin was painful to him . Even air would hurt it . But she was proud to see that her father was n't dirty , as she had feared  --  Mrs. Stocker had probably seen to that . He was clean . There was a soiled , shabby look about him , brought in from that untidy bachelor 's cabin , but really he was clean in the blank , empty way of the body that is a vessel at rest , emptying . Nina bent over him in silence . She washed him and patted him dry with a large white towel of that rough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water stains.  |p328Finally  the nurse said , " That 's good . That 's a good job . " As if under a kind of enchantment , Nina did not want to stop . She stared down at her father . His eyes were closed upon his thin , pale , flabby flesh , pale as wax . . . the look of flesh with its fat eaten away , dissolved . The pouches and pockets of its swellings remained behind , empty . " I . . . I want . . . " Nina began . " That 's a good enough job , " the nurse said . Nina waited downstairs . She had nowhere to go . She sat in the small empty lobby in her bright outfit , staring into space . Behind the counter , a lady watched her with disapproval . Nina tried to think , she had to think of what came next . . . and she kept remembering instead her father 's body , remembering the long , patient washing of it , the strong odor of the soap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . She must have sat there for two hours , in a daze . Then , abruptly , she went outside into a dreary May afternoon and walked down the street to a restaurant , where she ordered coffee . The restaurant was new , it had a shiny black front . But when she looked around , slowly , waiting to be served , she remembered the place : it was n't new , it was an old restaurant with a new front . That was all . Nearby , a man was looking at her . It was the brightness of her outfit , the jaunty colors , her face . . . . She was disgusted with herself suddenly . She hated herself . She got Conrad 's car from the hospital parking lot and drove slowly out to Lake Fredonia . There was no telephone at the cabin . Should she call the hospital ? When should she call ? . . . She knew nothing about the procedures of ordinary life . She had been outside life and had had no interest in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the cabin , she made her father 's bed and sat at one of the kitchen chairs , thinking . The cabin was small , oppressive . It pushed upon her . Fake wood paneling gave it a sly look , the curtains at the windows were of red and white plastic , tacked to the window frames . Piles of newspapers and magazines . A spider ran out of one and disappeared in a holep329somewhere . . . . Nina thought she might read a magazine or two , for something to do , but it was too much trouble for her to bend down and pick one up . . . . She was thinking of Conrad , remembering Conrad . On one of their walks , that first week , striding along with a volley of jokes between them . . . and suddenly Conrad had taken hold of her wrist and said , " Now , that 's enough , " and his face had gone hard , he was very serious . Nina tried to pull away . But he did not release her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Enough crap ! " he said . And , under the pressure of his fingers and his dead-end voice , Nina gave in as she always gave in to men when they arrived at this point  --  if they arrived at it  --  thinking that she did indeed belong to him now , it was inevitable that they should be lovers , it was dishonest to resist . She gave up pretending . Her irony vanished , her darting eyes became docile , she gave herself to Conrad and fell in love with him . . . . . . . And she was thinking of her father , or perhaps of his body and not of him , for she had never really known him . She remembered him as a presence at the supper table , years ago . Her mother was another body , another presence . He wobbled the table , sometimes , crossing his legs . Smoked during supper . He 'd had long , careless legs , he 'd worn overalls most of the time . From walking out in the fields or fooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his clothes , especially his trouser legs . How much they must have talked together , her mother and father ! All the words they had used up , the avalanche of meaningsthey had summoned !  --  and now it was silent , the house was sold to someone else and Nina had n't even thought of driving past it , all that was forgotten . She wondered how this had happened . She herself was thirty . Until now she had not thought about the heavy gravitation of her body that was pulling at her in such silence . She had never thought about it . From time to time she had talked with her friends about " life . " They all had plans . I 'll give up being a slut and get serious , Nina said , using a word thatp330was a parody of what respectable people might think about them . They used the language of respectable people from time to time , to test it , stretching their mouths upon it , showing distaste and hilarity . But she was too lazy to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could n't be serious , she had no interest in the security of marriage and a home in a suburban development , one or two children , shopping at supermarkets , being good , voting , wearing stockings . . . . She did not go to bed , but pulled the quilt up around her and remained sitting . She did not move . From the shock of seeing her father 's exposed body , her own body felt vague and dazzled . She had no appetite , she could not remember what eating was . It was not revolting to her but was instead meaningless . Sitting there , with a single light on , she had time to look around the cabin at its shadows , memorizing them . Her thighs stretched the fake-silk material of her slacks tight . Sitting , she seemed heavier than she was . She felt heavy . Her hands lay heavy and motionless on the quilt . The nails were colorless and blunt . There were several large ghostly half-moons on her nails ; they looked like something peeking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared down at them and could not move . The next day she returned to the hospital . The operation was over . She walked upstairs in a daze , very weak . Walking beside her , the young doctor talked  --  he was about her own age yet seemed younger  --  he was in such control that she felt her head begin to ache in envy of him . She was desperate with envy . Her father was very sick , he said . It had spread , the operation was stopped after half an hour , it was hopeless , she had to understand . . . . Yes , yes , Nina said angrily , she had understood all along . She wanted to see her father . It seemed that he had changed from the day before , that quickly . So a person can change that quickly . There was a soft , bloated look about his wasted flesh . His eyes were rimmed withp331red , as if he had been sleeping for years . He was doped up . He tried to ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly , " They do n't know yet . Tomorrow . Tomorrow they 'll know . " She stared at him . He seemed to be dozing . He was really a small man , what was left of him was small , old . Not very substantial . Was this , then , her father ? She looked over at the other man , whose bed was in a more favorable position by the window . Another old man . A body beneath the thin white blanket . He too might be a father , he might be her father . . . he too lay asleep or pretending sleep . In the end , one lies asleep or pretending sleep . The important thing is silence . After her father died she worked around the cabin , cleaning it up . She burned the piles of newspapers and magazines slowly . It took some time because she had to open them so that they could burn . They were damp , musty , and the smoke that rose from them seemed unclean . She burned other things too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of it would not burn , but lay charred and smoking in the rubble . Nina took her time . It was now early June . She began to go for long walks out along the beach . She was at peace , walking slowly . The early June air was cold , so far north , so she found an old pair of trousers back in the cabin and put them on . They were loose , a little soiled , very comfortable . She felt at peace . Out on the beach at dawn , with the mist rising frigidlyfrom the water , she stood with her hands in her pockets and stared out at nothing . She wrote Conrad : My father should be getting better soon . I 'll be back soon but he needs me now . When Conrad 's letters came , she did not bother to read them.  |p332She  burned them in the rubble heap . She threw them in with other things , not wanting to make a ritual of burning them , not wanting to emphasize anything . The beach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway cars passed often , so she did not go out there . She was running out of money but she did not think about it . She ate little , she had forgotten about eating . She sat for hours in her soiled , baggy clothes , men 's trousers and men 's shirts , thinking . She felt strangely quiet , fulfilled , as if under a final spell . Inside these clothes , protected by them , she remembered many things clearly . She remembered her father , and Conrad , and other men . . . they had been presences , certain substances . They had cast shadows . They had passed . Her own body went about its functions , not to be stopped . She paid attention to it , curious , feeling no shame but only curiosity . She was a woman and she had a woman 's body , she was a woman because she had a woman 's body , and the processes that belong to such a body . The processes could not be stopped . But she was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might observe them , without comment or shame . One day , out back of the cabin , she saw some women down on the beach . They belonged to the ugly pink cabin . They had driven up from the city and were wearing dresses , city clothes ; they were talking in light , animated voices . Nina stared at them . She felt that they were ugly in their bare legs , storks ' legs , with their high , shrill voices . . . . Men nad a kind of anonymity she desired ; they were negations , most of them . Their clothing negated them . They belonged in a vast sea of faces and bodies and were not anxious to emphasize themselves , to be bodies with names . Women , she noticed , were always shrieking their names . So she was no longer a woman : she withdrew . She stopped going out to the mailbox because there was nothing to interest her . For hours she sat in the cabin , thinking , wondering how everything had let her down , why it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her delusion was finished . She wanted to draw into herself the terrible experiences of her life  --  the violence of her love for men , the violence of her fear of them  --  and , in herself , bring them to nothing . She would force them to nothing . Conrad came up finally , by bus . He stormed around , arguing . He 'd been drinking on the bus and he had a pint of liquor with him . " What the hell is this ? What 's going on ? " he shouted . His face was flushed , he was amazed , incredulous . " Why did you lie to me , Nina ? So he 's dead , he 's buried , it 's all over with ? " He was not the kind of man she wanted to be . He bumped into things , he was loud , impatient , he emphasized things , he tried to argue with her . Nina , no longer lazy in the old way , but still , alert , and silent in a new way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothing , but not the kind of clothing Conrad wore . They were n't the same kind of man . She explained to him that she was not coming back . He told her she was crazy ; what the hell ? She told him she would stay here , she 'd make a living . . . maybe she could rent out the cabin and make money that way . . . . No , she was n't going back . She was finished with that . Conrad stayed for two days , going out to get more liquor and coming back to the cabin as if it were his . But it was not his . He understood that her power was stronger than his , or his body understood , for he did not try to make love to her , he used only words in his bitter argument with her . And finally he said , on his way out , " Stay here ! good-by ! So if you 're crazy , I at least got back my car !

I am carrying the books and the bag and my purse up against my chest , so that my shoulders are a little hunched . Sharon is with me , she and I are talking . She laughs at something I am saying . I clown around . I imitate a teacher at school , Miss Strong , who is very thin and cries sometimes . . . . But the Fear is beginning : there it is . At the end ofp335this block , and when we turn onto the next block . . . at the end of that block it will be waiting for me . It has a shimmering shape , no shape to it . I am sick inside .

We make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the house , behind the pulled shades , the Fear is waiting . " See you tomorrow , " Sharon says . She leaves me to it . Inside the house , silence .

I stand in the doorway thinking , What if somebody has broken in and has killed her , and now he 's waiting for me with a knife ? Nothing . The living room empty . Kitchen empty . " Ma . . . ? " There are two of us now , since my father left . I call out , " Ma ? Ma ? " Yesterday she was in bed at this time . I go back to her room , " their " room . . . the bed is n't made .

Why are you hiding ? " I ask her . I can smell her sweat . She says nothing . I can feel the weight in her , her body . She is panting . She hugs herself . She is making a funny noise  --  her teeth are chattering . " Why are you down here ? Why are you down here hiding ? " I scream 1969It is my job to outline precisely the lives of others .

She sits waiting to be interviewed on our show . You can almost see the energyin her , in her plump upper arms and the tension of her throat ! The star of the show is Vince Ellman , famous here in Detroit . He smokes quickly , helplessly , with his rogue 's smile . A boy . A boyish boy of forty-five . We have ten seconds to go . Eight seconds . Vince is fooling around . Everyone in the studio laughs . Mrs. Price laughs . She is wearing a nondescript suit and her laughter booms out , ruddy and delighted . We are on the air .

I am sitting in a chair that is in a row of chairs , clipboard on my lap , my mind blank . . . . Vince chats seriously with Mrs. Price . The terror of Detroit !  --  the tragedy of Detroit !  --  all put into words here this morning on the Vince Ellman show , so that people watching it can forget what is behind the words . If it can be talked about like this , a handsome man and a motherly woman , chatting , smiling seriously , if it can be televised and talked about , it can not be real and nothing will happen .

To smile like that you must slit the corners of your mouth carefully , with a razor blade . When the bleeding stops , you will be able to smile like Vince. 1956I am downtown alone , in a movie house . I have run away for a day . My head aches because I have n't eaten . I have run away , I have slowed down , I am sitting through a double feature , picking at my nails . There is a sudden impulse in me to lean forward and knock my head against the seat in front of me , I do n't know why . . . . At home my mother sits sometimes and hits her head against the wall , gently . I think she is trying to remember something . She sits clumsily facingp338the wall , as close as she can get , and then leans forward and bumps her head . Between the two of us there is a certain space , a certain kind of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head against the wall , something jumps in me , like a memory of my own , I do n't know what it could be . . . there is a force inside me that wants to be let out , to get out of me , but I do n't know what it is . This movie is about soldiers . Technicolor . A strange force makes the men run around  --  they are shooting guns , they are jumping across ditches , they are writhingon the ground , dying , coming to life again , shouting , they are not like my mother and me but I do n't understand the difference between us  --  why are some of us bodies , sitting in the dark , and some of us runningaround , our arms and legs so energetic ? But now something has happened : the sound track goes dead . The actors continue to move their mouths . Silly . A man in the audience giggles . I hate this silence . There is too much of it in the movie house . I am afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X969Vince leaning forward in the lovely fading light . Snow in heaps about us , cars passing slowly . . . . The sky is overcast , the sky is a few inches over our heads . Vince says , " What are you always thinking about ? Why are you so mysterious ? " He teases me , he is a little annoyed by me . Does n't he know there is a heaviness in me , a center of gravity deeper than his own ? He takes my hand between his hands and rubs it , briskly , though we are out in public , on the side/walk in front of Topinka 's . " My little girl has cold hands ! " he says , frankly and sweetly . He is like this on the show , often . It is his truest self . I fell in love with him , I think I fell in love with him , seeing him on the monitor that first day on the job . When I met him I saw a man of only moderate size , perky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald face . . . when I saw him on the monitor my heart contracted , a face stark and handsome and in control , words coming from it with such magic . . . . " You are on an island and I 'm coming to rescue you ! " he says , joking and not joking. 1957Three months of health ! Aunt Thelma comes over all the time . Father tried to come over  --  she would n't see him . ( He is drinking a lot , they say , he misses work all the time . ) But still she is healthy , she is changed , she goes to the beauty parlor and has her hair done like all the other women at our church , a permanent wave ; ugly . She smiles beneath the ugly hair . She makes breakfast and dinner for us , she makes real dinners , she goes out shopping by herself , and for three months she is healthy . . . . Then , one day , the shakes are upon her . . . I can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scream at her , " You 're doing it on purpose ! You hate me ! You 're doingit on purpose ! " The spell begins . She lies in bed , dressed . Her fingernails are dirty . She is staring , her face is pasty and bulbous , something is straining to get out . She reminds me of a tree , a dumpy tree , lying capsized , chopped down . Her fingers could turn
