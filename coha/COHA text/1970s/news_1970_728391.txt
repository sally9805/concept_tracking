txt The possibility of a chaotic presidential election in 1972 is forecast by a prime mover for Electoral College reform , Sen. Birch Bavh . The Indiana Democrat sees another tight three-man race in 1972 in which George C. Wallace may very well be positioned to give the election to the Democrat or the Republican candidate  --  depending on which one will give in most to the Wallace demands . Senator Bayh sees time fast running out on any prospects of getting a new system for electing the president through Congress and ratified by the state legislatures in time for the 1972 race . He favors a direct , popular election , one already voted by the House . This proposal has been lingering for months in the Senate Judiciary Committee on which Mr. Bayh serves . The interview follows : You are working hard to replace the Electoral College method with a direct presidential election . Is this reform still possible before 1972 ? Or is time fast running out ? I think we 've reached a crisis point . If we do n't act rather quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance whatsoever to get it passed . We are going to have to get the amendment passed in the Senate and iron out our differences with the House where it has been passed already and then go full speed to the state legislatures . Forty-five or 46 of them are meeting next year . A A You need three-quarters of them to ratify the amendment . This would be the .. . Yes , this is the 26th Amendment . A A Briefly , what is the direct-election plan ? A plan to choose the president by direct popular vote and abolish the Electoral College system . Under this plan the man who got the most votes wins . And if any winning candidate got less than 40 percent of the popular vote , then there would be a runoff between the top two . George Gallup took a poll in December of last year and one of the heartening things was that 81 percent of the people polled said they were in favor of direct election . Earlier , right after the election , a similar poll had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular vote . So you see that we 've been able to maintain a relatively high plateau of public interest . A A A What 's holding it up then ? My problem is in the full Judiciary Committee . The direct-election proposal has been approved by the judiciary subcommittee , and I intend to move to substitute it for the direct-election proposal in the full committee . It 's been the pending business in the full Judiciary Committee since August . A A And you would expect this substitution will be made in full committee , as a preliminary to bringing about a vote on direct election before the Senate as a whole ? Well , we 're going to make every effort . I think we have the votes to do it . A A A What , essentially , is the district plan that you oppose ? Where you keep your Electoral College and the electors would be divided into independent congressional districts with two electors running at large , statewide . A A A But if you are n't able to push through the direct plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district plan better than what we now have ? No , I do n't think so . I think it 's worse . One of the major concerns to me is that the president who becomes president under the Electoral College system might not have the most popular votes . That 's already happened three times . The chances for similar distortion are even greater under the district plan than they are under the present system . A A In other words , the plan you propose is the only one , as you see it , that would assure an election in which the man who would have the most votes would become president ? Yes . There are three major criteria that should be taken into consideration in setting up a new system : One , whatever plan we have should guarantee that the one who wins has the most votes . Two , it should guarantee that every man 's vote counts the same in determining the outcome . And three , it should guarantee that the people have a direct participatory part of the action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct-popular vote . A A Do you get any indication from the White House that the President or those working for the President will be active in support of the plan ? After all , does n't he have a lot to gain by election reform himself ? He could have lost the election last time had it been thrown into the House . Well , all I can attest to is the fact that he has endorsed it after some rather equivocal statements . Yes , the President did have a close call last time . Less than 42,000 votes could have done it . If there had been that kind of a change in certain proportions in three states , we would n't have elected any president , because neither Nixon nor Hubert H. Humphrey would have had enough votes . Then it would have gone to the House , according to the Constitution . There each state delegation has one vote , unless your delegation is divided and then you do n't get any vote at all . // *Bayh forecasts tight three-man race // But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With George Wallace having six electors and most of them having signed affidavits before election to do his bidding , he would have been in an excellent position to go first to the Nixon and then to the Humphrey camp and say , " All right , gentlemen , what am I bid to make you President of the United States ? " That would have been a tragedy . Not George Wallace per se , as an individual , as much as I might be opposed to him . But the fact that a president could be elected by backroom bargaining would be disastrous . Do you see the possibility that we are facink this same possibility of a chaotic solution to the presidential race in 1972 ? I think there 's no question about it . I do n't think there 's any way that Richard Nixon , despite the " Southern strategy , " can out-Wallace George Wallace in that part of the country . Say it is 1972 , and George Wallace determines to go for the presidency , and we have the present system . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or both , under our present system , are faced with the necessity of sitting down with a third party and making certain definite corn mitments , almost signed in blood , in exchange for these electors , who would then vote for one of the principal party candidates . One can easily imagine that coming to pass in 1972 . Obviously your big job now is to get electoral reform through Congress . You were quite successful in pushing along the Presidential Succession Act . How long did it take you to get that through ? I introduced it in December of 1963 . It was passed in July of 1965 . And then it was Feb. 17 , 1967 , that we had the ceremony down at the White House . The amendment had gone into effect on the 10th day of February . You are hopeful of achieving the same pace on electoral reform , are n't you ? Yes . But this is much more controversial . It is really a politically loaded issue , be-% cause each political leader , whether he 's a township @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a president , he automatically looks at any proposal in this way : " How will that affect me ? "
