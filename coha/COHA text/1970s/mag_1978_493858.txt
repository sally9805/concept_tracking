Columbia M-34539 , along with the delightful Papillons . But I slightly prefer Ashkenazy 's old performance on London 6471 because of its greater flamboyance and extravagance and , hence , its greater sense of what the music is about . Finally there are some reissues from old 78-rpm records . Delightful vocal recitals by the great lyric tenor John McCormack and the enchanting mezzo-soprano Conchita Supervia are available , respectively , on RCA CRM1-2472 and Seraphim 60291 . More important is the EMI album ( Y4 34643 ) of 1932-36 Budapest Quartet performances , the greatest of which is the 1933 one of Mozart 's greatest quartet , the seldom heard K. 499 , a performance incandescent enough to light up anyone 's Christmas . clamoring for more of Moony 's drawings , and all squeezed inside a bright yellow Rolls Royce ( drawn and transformed by Moony ) . The resolution and the " just-in-case-eraser " is Moony 's perfectly logical way out of the mess he 's gotten himself into . McPhail 's drawings are scratchy bursts of color with hundreds of tiny cross-ink lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws to scare away his obnoxious visitors could be no other color , and the overall effect is one of abandon and delight . Wildly imaginative , The Magical Drawings of Moony B. Finch is sure to capture and hold the attention of even the most discriminating young reader . Another wonderful picture book this season is Tomie de Paola 's Clown of God ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; $8.95 cloth , $3.95 paper ) , the touching story of the juggler who brings his only gift to the Christ child on Christmas day . Paola 's juggler achieves fame and fortune after many years of hard work at perfecting his craft . But soon all the people of the land become tired and bored by this aging vaudevillian , and the old juggler is forced to return to the life of a wanderer , begging for his sustenance . Withered and distraught , he One of this season 's most beautiful books for older children ? and for adults who have not lost the capacity for wonder ? is Beauty and the Beast , retold by Marianne Mayer ( Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mercer Mayer 's illustrations are lavishly detailed depictions of mystery , magic , desire and fear . Mayer is one of the best children 's book illustrators today ; his work ranks with that of Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac , progenitors of the form . Though Mayer 's style varies greatly from book to book ? and all are generally impressive works ? Beauty and the Beast is undoubtedly one of his best efforts to date . Mayer uses water-washed inks : wine reds , maples , golden-brown hazes ? punctuated at precise moments by the ice-blue roses hidden in the depths of the beast 's garden , or the milky orange glow in the beast 's eyes ? a masterful expression of tenderness in the face of terror . The tale is simply but affectingly told . A poor widower is forced to leave his youngest daughter in the care of a ghastly beast after he innocently steals a single red rose from the beast 's garden . But the beast is gentle and gives to Beauty all that she desires ? a gift she isunable to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bring herself to love him . The message of the tale is clear : That night Beauty dreamed again of the garden and the shimmering pond . She looked for the prince but he was not there . Instead she saw the old woman . " How blind you are ! I had hoped you would know that happiness comes from seeing what does not always lie on the surface . Some things are not on the surface at all . " In The Magical Drawings of Moony B. Finch ( Doubleday ; $6.95 ) , another story about mysterious appearances , a young boy 's drawings are magically transformed into the depicted objects themselves . The author ; David McPhail , carries us through the story with a cadence as jazzy as the vivid colors he uses to illustrate it ; as rhythmic as the name Moony B. Finch . Moony loves to draw . One day he is beset by a slew of greedy visitors who soon discover the unique quality of his drawings . Before long Moony is surrounded by a motley crowd : an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging a briefcase ; a red-haired basketball player resembling Bill Walton , dribbling a ball ; a loud-mouthed , nosy mother ? all arrives one day at the church of the monks in time for the procession of gifts for the Holy Child . With a ragged plum sack slung across his shoulders , the juggler walks humbly before a rather stern , Byzantine statue of the Holy Child upon his mother 's lap : Giovanni opened his bag and shook out his old costume . Then he put on his clown face . . . and began to juggle . . . . First the red ball , then the orange . . . " And finally , " cried Giovanni , " The sun in the Heavens ! " The gold ball flew up and around and around , higher and higher . Giovanni had never juggled so well in all his life . . . " For You , sweet Child , for Your he cried . And suddenly , his old heart stopped . The solemnity of the moment is there , in the colored balls around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sad expression on the monk 's face . The ending is as special as the drawings ? the statue is transfigured by the juggler 's gift from the heart ? and the golden ball is left sitting in the palm of the Holy Child 's hand . A Christmas Card ( Houghton Mifflin ; $5.95 ) , by Paul Theroux , is also a moving story , but it is highly filtered through the eyes of an adult ? and a particularly literate adult at that ? and may be less accessible to younger readers . All good children 's stories are full of exciting language and rhythms , metaphors , symbols and other imaginative devices . The trick , of course , is to parlay these elements into a form young readers can easily grasp . Theroux 's story is a remembrance of a childhood past , but the writing style seems overly complex for the audience for which this book is intended . It is burdened by some cumbersome phrases and expressions unlikely to be appreciated or understood even by a child of nine or 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents as " lovers , " " peers " into a window , " felt such a shrinking in my soul . . . when I realized the deception of those flat pictures , " and , looking at the Christmas card , " I searched it for something more . I almost wept at the cruelty of it . There seemed something evil in the way it had vanished , and I went back to bed feeling very sad , as if a precious light had turned to dismal ashes . " These writerly touches seem unnecessarily pretentious and out of place in an otherwise enchanting story for children . A Christmas Card opens and closes with an affirmation of magic . When pressed for a definition , the father responds : What is magic ? It is something being proven , not necessarily to make you understand , but so you will believe . The trick itself is a command , and the command is always the magician saying , " Believe in me ! " Determined to give his children a country Christmas , the father takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in a blizzard . An elusive old man appears from nowhere and takes them into his home , where they are warmed and comforted by his stories and a blazing fire . The man inexplicably disappears the next morning , leaving only a Christmas card ? a card the young boy soon discovers changes to reflect the world around it . The illustrations , though few , are deliberately somber : black and white line-drawings , shadowed and sparse in detail . But they complement this thoughtful , gentle , though difficult tale . Felix Hoffmann , a Swedish artist , died before completing the illustrations for The Bearsktnner , ( Atheneum ; $8.95 ) an old tale by the Brothers Grimm . His preliminary color studies and brush sketches represent a finished work , however ; one that captures the darker side of life , while retaining a certain glory and momentum . There is an urgency in Hoffmann 's inspired drawings ? one can almost sense his rush to finish . The colors are taken from the woods themselves , an almost bleak choice of muted browns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red jacket or the young maiden 's water-blue dress . Like all good fairy tales , The Bear-skinner is the story of a test . The devil offers a poor soldier a lifetime of gold if he can live for seven years without being killed . The soldier must never wash or remove the massive bearskin across his back . He is forced to wear the devil 's green cloak , but its pockets are filled with an endless supply of gold . The soldier uses the money to bribe the townspeople into showing him kindness , as he has become a gruesome apparition . The dramatic impact of the soldier 's trial is more evident in Hoffmann 's drawings than in the narrative itself , which more than once grows too prosaic . But it remains a serious tale ; one more likely to speak to the older child who recognizes that the road to fortune is not an easy one . ment , a take-off on those personal guides currently cluttering supermarket paperback racks , with each piece addressing a particular topic . Examples : " The Lonely Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Eating Alone in Restaurants , " " How to Take a Successful Nap , " " At the Beach , " etc . Friedman surely is as adept at fast gags as the best of the supposed pros ? the rare goofs who occasionally trot out from behind the rainbow-striped curtains on " The Tonight Show " and surprise you by actually being funny . Examples again : on defining Lonely Guys , " They tend to be a little bald and look as if they have been badly shaken up in a bus accident . " And , " Women can be Lonely Guys , too , . . She 's not going to be throwing any eggs in the pan at four in the morning , but Jacqueline Onassis may be a Lonely Guy . On nights when she has been escorted to the ballet by the wrong Iranian . " And , " All of Canada may be a Lonely Guy . " On another level , Friedman appears to be getting at soberer matters here .
