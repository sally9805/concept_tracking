At their first summit in Moscow in 1972 , President Nixon gave Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev a Cadillac . At their second meeting last year in Washington , Nixon gave him a Lincoln Continental . Last week , back in Moscow for the third summit in as many years , Nixon brought with him a sporty Chevrolet Monte Carlo for the Soviet Union 's foremost automobile enthusiast . In a curious sense , the gift of the cheaper auto , * which Brezhnev had specifically requested after reading that it was Motor Trend magazine 's " car of the year , " was an appropriate symbol of the more relaxed relations between Washington and Moscow and the metamorphosis of summits from the extraordinary into the ordinary . <P> Moscow 1974 had the down-home feeling of a reunion , with medium-size expectations and modest hopes . " It is almost routine now , " said a Soviet official , as he surveyed the summit 's opening-night festivities in the Kremlin 's St. George 's Hall . " Last time Nixon came it took us three months to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Minor Accords . A major agreement on the control of nuclear arms , a follow-up to 1972 's historic SALT I ( Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ) treaty , had been hoped for just a few months ago . It was all but ruled out even before the conference began as the two sides disputed which country should give up what in the complex equation of nuclear parity ( TIME , July 1 ) . " Nuclear agreements are not the core of this summit , " said Presidential Chief of Staff Alexander Haig . " It 's a terribly difficult subject . There is concern about the two sides going too far , too fast . We ca n't pull the souffl out of the oven before it 's ready . " <P> Though there was still the possibility that Nixon and Brezhnev might make some breakthrough weapons agreement by the end of their talks , so far there were only two minor arms accords in sight : one to ban big underground nuclear explosions ( all other major tests were stopped by the two countries in 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of places each nation is allowed to protect with anti-ballistic missiles ( ABMS ) . In addition , there were a host of other pacts in other areas . Among them : <P> &gt; A ten-year trade agreement providing for , among other things , the exchange of industrial information and economic forecasts-both of which the Soviets have been reluctant to supply-and for mutual help in finding trade offices and homes for businessmen . Soviet-American trade has already risen dramatically ( from $200 million in 1971 to $1.4 billion in 1973 ) , and only last week , coincident with the summit , the Occidental Petroleum Corp . signed a series of 20-year contracts with the Soviets for a giant swap of chemicals . Though money would not change hands , the value of the barter deal at current prices would be about $20 billion . <P> &gt; An agreement to share heart research , including the design of synthetic cardiac valves and the development of artificial hearts . <P> &gt; An agreement to pool information on non-nuclear production of energy , including energy from solar and geothermal sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
