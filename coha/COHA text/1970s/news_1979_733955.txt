To the Editor : The nightmarish quality of Tom Wicker 's recent reports from South Africa bodes ill for the United States , as it does for that embattled land . His are only the latest in a spate of pessimistic articles predicting doom for that country . The consensus is that very few whites in that region , be they verlighte ( enlightened ones ) , academics or the English-speaking " progressives , " are prepared to make meaningful concession to the demographically overpowering black majority . Mr. Wicker , like other Americans conscious of our own tragic history of race relations , is not prepared to be too critical of white South Africans . In fact , most of the organs of our Government , the business community and the leaders of our academic institutions have not wished to push the South Afri , ? What Turkey Can Do For Its Own Recovery To the Editor : Your Jan. 3 editorial dealing with Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy expresses understandable sympathy . Is it not fitting , however , to remind Turkey that it should contribute toward its own recovery , financially and also morally , by desisting from a costly military occupation of almost half the territory of the Republic of Cyprus that has continued over four years , in gross violation of international law and of the unanimous decisions of the United Nations , endorsed by the Security Council , in which the United States fully participated . It is noteworthy that the general situation in Turkey ? politically , socially and psychologically ? began deteriorating after the invasion of Cyprus and the beginning of suffering for its people : one-third of the total island population expelled from their homes ; the agony of the families of over 2,000 Cypriot prisoners , mostly civilians , transported to Turkey and thereafter declared missing . The present juncture would call for a broader perspective . Assistance to Turkey would prove of real value and substantially improve matters if it carried with it an inducement for Ankara to abandon the negativeness of an expansionist policy on Cyprus and cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a solution consistent with the emphatic pronouncements of the world community . It is earnestly to be hoped that these developments may prove positive in assisting Turkey to liberate itself from itself , in its own interest and in that of all concerned , as well as for peace in the area and beyond . ( Ambassador ) ZENON ROSSIDES Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations New York , Jan. 8 , 1979 To the Editor : If it were not so confounded funny , I would be outraged to the kneecaps by your Jan. 2 article to the effect that my tax dollars , via the Department of H.E.W. , are being used by educationalists to teach children how to watch television with a critical eye . The curriculum sounds absolutely fascinating , along with the brilliant judgment undergirding the project that " TV is neither good nor bad , " along with the notion of teaching kids how to " ' watch intelligently . " As a matter of fact , having been a teacher for 30 years and a father for 24 , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson or two in this occult art to the assorted " project directors " who have swindled our Government for this particular caper . Youngsters are often far sharper than adults in determining the rationality of persuasion , in identifying " stereotypes " and even in the incredibly difficult task of figuring out the differences becans into their laager . The fact remains , however , that the situation in South Africa is too dangerous to our own country for us not to give its solution our highest priority . The tragic aspect of most of the reporting from South Africa is that no one appears to be placing that country 's plight in either historical or social-scientific perspective . For example , most observers do not believe that the blacks will soon be able to overthrow the South African Government , given the latter 's strength . But how many observers have ever been able to predict successful revolutions ? It is only after revolutions have failed or succeeded that their major elements have been recognized . Then observers note novel features that no one suspected existed .

In the first place , the word should be " co-vivent " since it is derived from the third-conjugation Latin verb vivere ( see " president , regent , correspondent " ) . But we are all " co-vivent . " Much more precise would be " co-habitant , " a word that already exists and that has long been accepted as a description of the above relationship . ( See the dictionary . ) By the way , how is it that no one pays honor to the memory of Judge Ben Lindsey , whose advocacy some 50 years ago of " Companionate Marriage " anticipated the prevalent life style of so many of the young ? WILLIAM BARROUR Brewster , Mass. , Jan. 4 , 1979 tween what happens on the tube and what happens in real life . How grand it will be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " only one of the many ways in which to see the world " ! I presume that the course of study will also teach some of the other ways , which I can not list here because of a shortage of paper . I do not think , in the light of educational pioneering of this sort , that we need to wonder too long or hard why students coming to college these days can neither read nor write nor do fractions . Distractions of modernity may have something to do with it , but as long as this kind of cotton candy uses up precious time that could be devoted to legitimate instruction in basic skills we shall indeed produce a generation of citizens who know how to watch television  --  and nothing else . GEORGE N. GORDON Professor of Communications Muhlenberg and Cedar Crest Colleges Allentown , Pa. , Jan. 2,1979 tem has its own contradictions , and it is these contradictions that overcome systems . Moreover , there has never been a system of tyranny , be it that of George III or the Czars , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , in both America and Russia external factors aided the revolution , but can this not happen in South Africa ? The second issue posed by the South Africa situation is the ability of that country to change successfully ? instead of a " hardening of attitudes in the stand-pat percentage , " the development by the verkrampte ( hardliners ) of a program for slow but systematic change . One may not completely agree with Crane Brinton that " revolutions are born of hope " and that they often occur once tyranny lightens and the downtrodden gain a brighter vision of their future . Nevertheless , it appears that our own civil rights revolt in the 1960 's took place when at least some blacks had dreams , whether of " black power " or of a " promised land . " This , however , is no argument against South African whites changing their society gradually . It only suggests that one should not be too sanguine that gradual change will solve South Africa 's dilemma . The third issue concerns our otri country 's relationship to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more difficulty a " colonial " or " colonial-like " territory has had in yielding power to its majority , the greater the danger for its " metropole , " or " mother-country . " Britain colonized a great empire fairly easily , and with few demonstrations in London . France had difficulty both in Indochina and in Algeria and experienced riots all over the country and the specter of the descent of paratroopers from Algeria on Paris . Portugal had even greater difficulty decolonizing Africa , and the revolution took place in Lisbon itself . Are there implications here for our country ? Our tragedy is that , whether we like it or not , the United States has inherited the role of " metropole " of all whites in Southern Africa . This is not a role we welcomed , but it is one we can not avoid . Thus , despite Britain 's de jure responsibility for Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe ) and the United Nations ' responsibility for Southwest Africa ( Namibia ) , we are the ones who have led the discussions about the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is not pushing South Africa fast enough to change its ways , even in the face of the potential disaster which lies ahead for both countries . Remembering the reactions of Americans to Vietnam , a country with which we had no economic , historical or racial links , and the attitude of many Americans toward the still-simmering Middle East conflict , I tremble for the United States when I contemplate what would happen it , swayed by either sentiment or duty , we were forced to intervene dtirinp the entninty hnineattct in Smith Africa .

Bigotry 's Last Stand To the Editor : It 's amazing how the Polish joke syndrome ( America 's last vestige of acceptable bigotry ) works its way , often in subliminal form , into almost anything having to do with Polishness . Your Dec. 31 editorial " The Spirit of St. Stanislaus " serves as an example . We first had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland censor all of Pope John Paul 's Christmas Day references to St. Stanislaus " was not the beginning of a Polish joke .

However , the needless and irrelevant editorial aside clearly shows the shameful effect of this country 's insensitivity toward a people blessed with a great heritage . JOHN . ) . GMEREK Forest Hills , N.Y. , Jan. 1 , 1979 On Teaching Children to Watch TV How Benjamin Cardozo Became a Court of Appeals Judge To the Editor : On Dec. 26 you said in an editorial about the new process of selecting Court of Appeals judges through nomination by a commission that New Yorkers and the judiciary have thus been spared the demeaning process of candidates for that court campaigning for election . With equal truth , you found this to insure that someone worthy of respect will succeed to a chair graced by judges like Benjamin Cardozo . What is not generally known is that . both the state and the nation narrowly missed having lost the services of Cardozo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , to which he added so much distinction , if he had had to face an election campaign . It is true that he had been elected to the Supreme Court of the State of New York , but that was wholly fortuitous . Cardozo had been nominated , at the urging of the bench , in order to give respect to the Fusion Party ticket , headed by John Purroy Mitchel , and was elected by a narrow margin , a litt le over 3,000 votes . Within weeks after taking office Cardozo was designated by the Governor to serve temporarily on the Court of Appeals to help clear up its logjam . Then , in January 1917 , a vacancy occurred in the Court of Appeals , and Gov . Charles S. Whitman immediately offered the appointment to Cardozo , which would have involved his running for election to that post the following November and would also have required his immediate resignation as Supreme Court justice . This he refused to do . The  --  Govenior eventually turned to the then president of the City Bar Association and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , George L. Ingraham , who was practicing law after his retirement from the bench , and advised him that all efforts to prevail on Cardozo to accept the position had failed and that it was urgent that someone else be appointed . Ingraham begged for more time and then pleaded with the leaders of both political parties to agree on the nomination of Cardozo , combined with the nomination of Chester B. , an associate judge on the Appellate Division bench in the Fourth Department . When he succeeded in getting that bipartisan agreement , Cardozo accepted . For him , this involved a reduction in salary : $17,500 as a Supreme Court justice to $10,000 as a . Judge of the Court of Appeals . But that did not deter him from writing Judge Ingraham to express his gratitude for Ingraham 's help in accomplishing the result . Yet it has often been said that even such great jurists as Cardozo had reached the pinnacle despite the fact that they had to be elected to the post .
