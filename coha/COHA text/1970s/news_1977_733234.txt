txt President Carter 's statements concerning possible recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) injected elements of both drama and confusion into Secretary of State Cyrtis fl . Vance 's opening talks with the kraelis . Statements made to reporters both by the President and Mr. Vance over the past two days heightened the likelihood of extremely tough bargaining ? if-not confrontation with the Israelis as Mr. Vance 's six-nation tour or the ' N'liddle East neared its conclusion . The confusion stemmed from apparent llintradictions between what was said by Pre , , ident Carter lug . 8 and by the Secretary State concerning indirect peace signals from the PLO // From page 1 Peace drama grips Mideast on Vance tour Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan after his first meeting with Mr. Vance Aug. 9 reaffirmed the basic Israeli position against participation in peace talks . At a news conference Mr. Dayan said Israel wants separate peace treaties with the Arabs and opposes withdrawal to the 1967 borders as well as the establishment of a Palestinian state . But . he said , Israel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a settlement which would'take into account Israel 's security needs . This would not allow " foreign control " of the West Bank of the Jordan River . In a secret memorandum of agreement concluded in 1975 the U.S. made a commitment to Israel not to recognize or negotiate with the PLO so long as the PLO did not recognize Israel 's " right to exist " and did not accept two UN Security Council resolutions which in effect trade Arab recognition of the state of Israel for withdrawal of the Israelis ' from Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war . Opened opportunities President Carter told newsmen Aug. 8 that if the Palestinians recognized the UN resolutions , it would open up opportunities for direct U.S.- . PLO talks and possible participation by the PLO in the Geneva peace conference , a conference which the U.S. would like to see reconvened by the end of this year . A State Department spokesman later revealed that the U.S. had dropped its insistence that the PLO also renounce provisions in its national charter which call for the destruction of Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia for Israel Aug. 9 when he said if the PLO were to accept UN Resolution 242 , it would amount , in his judgment , to revoking the national charter . An Israeli official said these statements from the President and the Secretary of State had thrown Israel " into a tizzy , " and that appeared to be an understatement . Reporters accompanying Mr. Vance found Israeli acquaintances talking of little else . Mr. Vance added an element of confusion . however , by sounding less certain than President Carter did about the possibility of PLO willingness to drop its opposition to Resolution 242 . The PLO has consistently objected to the fact that the resolution refers to the Palestinians only as " refugees " and fails to refer to their " rights " as a people . Through the Carter and Vance statements the U.S. has conveyed an impression of eagerness to enter into direct talks with the PLO in order to overcome problems relating to the Palestinians . One snag is that the U.S.-Israeli agreement of 1975 gives Israel virtual veto power over PLO participation in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , group , or organization to the original group of participants would require the agreement of all the initial participants , and those include Israel . Whatever comes of the U.S.-PLO probing and exchange of " peace signals , " the Israelis have reason to be concerned that the U.S. , by focusing on the problem of the Palestinians , and indicating a desire to bring them directly into the negotiating process , is gradually conferring a sense of legitimacy on the PLO . Monitor contributor Jason Morris reports : Secretary of State Vance is up against an Israeli stone wall blocking participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Middle East peace talks regardless of whether the venue is Geneva , New York , or Washington . Finance Minister Simha Ehrlich , a member of the Cabinet 's six-man team negotiating with Mr. Vance , declared emphatically that there will be no talks with the PLO . If his position can be accepted as firm government thinking , and by all indications it can , the possibility that the PLO might accept UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
