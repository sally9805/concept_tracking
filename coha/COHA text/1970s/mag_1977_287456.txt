A bit of good news flickered last week amid the generally bleak reports of shuttered factories , mass layoffs and shivery households caused by the nation 's natural-gas shortage . After more than 19 months of exhaustive hearings , a Federal Power Commission official supported one of three competing proposals to construct a new pipeline that would funnel huge reserves of gas from Alaska 's North Slope to the Lower 48 states . The system would outrank the nearly completed Alaskan oil pipeline as one of the biggest private construction projects in history . When completed in five years or so , it would transport 6% of present U.S. consumption , or nearly 2.5 billion cu . ft. of gas daily . <P> FPC Administrative Law Judge Nahum Litt endorsed the plan submitted by Arctic Gas , a consortium of 16 American and Canadian energy and utility firms . His 430-page decision , based on 45,000 pages of testimony and 1,000 or so exhibits , by no means settles the matter , which touches on such highly combustible issues as money , nationalism and environmentalism . Lilt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law must recommend a pipeline route to President Carter by May 1 . The President then has until Dec. 1 to accept the recommendation or choose another plan ; his decision will open the way for construction to begin , unless either the House or Senate rejects it . In addition , if the plan involves shipping gas through Canada , it must get the approval of that country 's National Energy Board and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . <P> <P> The stakes are enormous . Alaska 's proven gas reserves , concentrated around Prudhoe Bay ( see map ) total 22 trillion to 26 trillion cu . ft . That is about 10% of all the known gas in the nation . Moreover , new finds in the area could increase reserves by 15 times that much . Thus supporters of the three rival systems will push hard for their projects at each step in the decision-making process - though Litt 's recommendation clearly gives Arctic Gas a leg up on its competitors , the El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Alcan Pipeline Co . <P> The Arctic plan proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of about $8.5 billion , from Prudhoe Bay east along the Yukon coastal plain to the Mackenzie River delta , where it would pick up additional gas from Canadian fields . The system would then continue south through tundra , bush , lakes and streams to a spot in Alberta , where it would split , with one leg delivering gas to Pacific markets and the other servicing Midwestern and Eastern customers in Canada and the U.S. <P> Litt found the Arctic plan " clearly superior " to the other proposals . For one thing , the Arctic system would direct more gas than the other lines to the most scantily supplied sections of the U.S. - the Midwest and the East Coast . Then , too , the FPC estimates that transportation costs for the Arctic plan would be about $1.60 per 1,000 cu . ft. , v. $1.91 for the Alcan route and $2.15 for the El Paso system . The main criticism of the project is that it could tear up the delicate environmental balance of the region .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
