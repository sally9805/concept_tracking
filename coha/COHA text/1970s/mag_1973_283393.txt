THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE <P> by JOHN GODEY 316 pages . Putnam. $6.95 . <P> <P> Glamorous trains are disappearing fast , in fact as well as fantasy . About the only vehicle left for adventure on rails is the big-city subway . It can rattle along divertingly enough , as in the famous chase sequence in the movie The French Connection . But as used in a novel like The Taking of Pelham One Two Three , the subway car as dramatic conveyance produces the sinking , shrinking feeling of a subgenre in decline . Once we roared across frontiers on the Orient Express ; now we lurch along on a Lexington Avenue local . <P> " Pelham one two three " is New York City subway jargon for the train that sets out from the Pelham Bay Park terminal in The Bronx at 1:23 p.m . In John Godey 's " What if ... ? " exercise , the front car of such a train is hijacked by four highly organized , submachine-gun-toting terrorists . They hold the motorman and 16 passengers hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000,000 ransom . The hostages do not panic ; after all , they represent that well-rounded social group - a call girl , a wise old man , a black militant , a housewife and her children - that has survived so many capsized ships , stalled elevators and jet liners piloted by Dean Martin . They seem to realize , as the reader surely does , that eventually order will be restored in a shower of bullets , heroics and heavy ironies . <P> Heaven and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority know that Godey 's plot is not far removed from the reality of the contemporary urban nightmare . But Godey tries to whip up extra credibility by introducing each new twist in the drama with a flourish of fact-filled three-by-five cards . Want to know how many miles of track there are in the New York subway system ? Where Alfred Ely Beach 's 1867 private subway tunnel is ? What it means to " jump a block " ? Maybe not , but Godey is going to tell you . He can not even write a scene about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansion , the mayoral residence . <P> Too bad such authentic research could not be applied to Godey 's characters . His people seem little more than hollow molds waiting to be filled by some Hollywood casting director . In a way this is fitting . In print form , Pelham One Two Three is really only a short connecting ride between the scary movies that seem to have inspired it and the scary movie that it all too clearly aspires to be . <P> - Christopher Poterfield
