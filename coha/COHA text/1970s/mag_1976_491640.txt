Imagine a sane , dignified gentleman strolling across a meadow , a forked twig in his hands . Onlookers giggle ; he ignores them , concentrating on the stick , mentally asking it to point out the best source of water on his land . Near a corner of the field , the tip of the twig is suddenly pulled downward , seemingly by an inexplicable force . He carefully marks the spot and calls in a well driller , telling him there 's water , plenty of it , about 125 feet down . The driller shrugs . " It 's your money , " he says and starts work . Later the gentleman gets a call : " We 've hit an underground river ! You have enough water to supply the whole town . " The depth : 127 feet . The water : clear and pure . That is exactly what happened to Joseph Baum , a Hartford , Connecticut advertising executive , when he needed water for his 130-acre farm ten years ago . Baum began dowsing in 1950 . People started calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he has located some two dozen wells for other people , often to within a few feet of his predicted depth , and written a book of instruction for beginning dowsers ( The Beginner 's Handbook of Dowsing , Crown , $2.95 ) . Baum estimates that at least cinated mankind for centuries . Experienced dowsers estimate that nearly a quarter million wells sunk on the Atlantic seaboard since Colonial times were located by " witching , " many still producing plenty of water . Today , fully 25,000 people like Baum practice the arcane art in the United States while millions more , without knowing it , may possess the skill . " There is no trickery involved , " declares Baum . " Animals in the bush can ' smell ' a water hole miles away . Perhaps the ability to dowse is the vestige of some such animal instinct . " Dowsing , one of those maddeningly slippery phenomena that slide back and forth between truth and fiction , has long been a subject of controversy . According to the U.S. Geological Survey , dowsing lacks adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out that aerodynamically , bumblebees ca n't fly . ) Geologists claim that in many places water can be found no matter where one digs . But what , ask dowsers , about the areas where this is not so ? Water diviners are just reading the lay of the land , continue critics . Then why , counter the dowsers , can they often find water where a trained geologist ca n't ? Is it pure coincidence , or is there more to the forked-stick phenomenon than meets the critical eye ? For example , how explain the case of New Sharon , Maine , a small town that until last summer was so short of water that residents were restricted to a single bath a week per family ? In the previous five years , the town had sunk $180,000 worth of federal loans into geological studies and deep wells that consistently turned up dry . As a last resort , community officials hired a professional dowser for $500 . Armed with his divining rod , he shortly located a well that provided all the water the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Shoreline Clinic in Essex , Connecticut , a regional emergency health care center that was nearing completion when a problem cropped up threatening the entire million-dollar project ? Though several thousand dollars had been spent , engineers were unable to obtain sufficient water from four wells sunk at sites deemed most hydrologically promising . A local water witch heard about the problem and volunteered his services . Following the pull of his Y-shaped fiberglass divining rod like a farmer holding the reins of a plow horse , he headed toward the rear of the clinic property where the stick suddenly bobbed earthward . A drill rig started work and soon the well was yielding twenty gallons per minute , plenty of water for the new clinic . Skeptics , who have not felt the tug of a forked stick , scoff in they know all that water was there ? Scholars can only speculate . Although the forked stick has become the classic instrument , a wide variety of tools have been used over the ages : whalebone , crowbars , pliers , blades of grass , even bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are favored by some dowsers since they are smoother to hold . ( Forked sticks , though still popular , are reported to react so violently at times that the bark peels off the twig , leaving the hands red and raw . ) It does n't matter what kind of rod one chooses , spite of such stories . It is simply impossible , they say , illogical , ridiculous . Dowsers are often ridiculed as gullible , superstitious , or just plain crazy . Yet there are far too many incidents of successful water witching to ignore all the evidence . " Just because science does n't have an answer does n't mean it ca n't work , " insists Baum . " We are still surrounded by mysteries here on earth which at present can not be explained . " Dowsing is one of the most ancient , mysterious practices known to man . It goes back for millennia , but just how far back no one realized until a team of French archaeologists stumbled upon some 8,000-year-old cave paintings in the Atlas Mountains on the Saharan fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , surrounded by a group of onlookers . The crowd perhaps regarded him as a magician , conjuring forth the most basic need of man . The idea of the magic wand may well have begun with the divining rod which gained power in the hands of a sorcerer . Some students trace the works of dowsers through Biblical times . Were the rods and staffs of the prophets actually divining rods ? they ask . When Moses smote the rock to bring forth water in the wilderness , was he in fact dowsing ? And what of Jacob 's Well in Palestine , scene of the meeting between Jesus and the Woman of Samaria ? It was dug by hand in the middle of a desert , 140 feet down through solid limestone , and is still in use today . How did however ; the ability lies not in the tool , but in the user . Although he may not be aware of it , it is the dowser who is moving the rod . Dowsing is an odd skill that ducks up in often-unexpected places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L-shaped dowsing rods made of bent wire that seem to swing apart or together when over buried water lines . Many utility companies employ dowsers to find telephone cables , water mains and electrical power lines . In Vietnam engineer units of the First and Third Marine Divisions successfuly used bent coat hangers to locate enemy tunnels , booby traps and mines . Some oil prospectors swear by the rod . Near Salina , Kansas a " doodle-bugger , " as oil dowsers are called , has been so successful that his financial backers say : " We do n't care if he finds oil with a teaspoon , as long as he finds it . " It works for law enforcement agencies , too . Using the traditional forked stick , a deputy sheriff in Arizona quickly found stolen and stripped autos that had been dumped in a trench and covered over by a bulldozer . Even archaeologists have tried it . On an expedition to locate the wrecked whaler Gibbs in Hudson Bay , dowsers found the vessel under eight feet of ice without any difficulty . Most bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hamilton , Ontario jail when the 100year-old facility was to be torn down . Since its beginning , until forty-four years ago , an undetermined number of murderers had been executed and buried in the prison yard . The jail had left no records and the graves were unmarked . How to locate the bodies and move them to the nearest consecrated ground before demolition began ? Once again , a dowser came to the rescue . Crisscrossing the yard with his rod , he pinpointed five spots . A backhoe bit into the earth at each place and came up with five human remains , which were removed to a cemetery . When the rest of the prison yard was torn up , not another bone was found . Like any other skill , dowsing , practitioners of the art say , takes continuous practice . Some say it works best when there is real need and no monetary gain involved . To keep his ability sharp , Ted Kaufmann , a New York City advertising executive , dowses the water mains under the city streets . To check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known , looks for the nearest Con Edison crew and reports his findings  --  almost always accurate . " They can never figure out how I know , " he grins . " When I tell them I 'm a water witch , they sort of inch away . " Witchcraft or not , in some places government agencies and private companies are recognizing dowsing as practical . In Britain , dowsers are hired by community water boards to spot problems in buried water lines . The Roche Pharmaceutical Company of Basel , Switzerland , employstwo full-time dowsers to check for adequate underground sources at plant sites . The men have scored consistently and accurately in India , Japan , Indonesia and Australia . In the U.S.S.R. , scientists are actively pursuing the field , which they call the Biophysical Method ( BPM ) . At a conference in Prague in 1973 , Soviet Professor Aleksandr Bakirov reported that dowsers can indeed detect ore bodies , subterranean streams and oil . A number of problems in geological mapping are being solved with the aid of BPM . Declared Bakirov : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is there a physiological basis for dowsing ? Some scientists think there is . In the United States , Dr Zaboj V. Harvalik , physicist and former adviser to the U.S. Army 's Advanced Concepts Material Agency , has found that many of those who claim the ability to dowse are unconsciously sensitive to small disturbances in the earth 's magnetic field  --  anomalies verifiable by scientific instrumentation and caused by underground objects . In tests , he has had subjects walk across a low-intensity electromagnetic beam that can be switched on and off . Sensitive dowsers seem to have picked up " dowsing signals " from it . Yet they have failed to do so when certain parts of their body  --  the kidney area , or the head  --  have been shielded with heavy aluminum or copper foil . This suggests the existence of magnetic sensors in those parts of the body , as well as a " signal processor " in the brain which transmits the command for subliminal arm-muscular contractions that move the rod . Says Dr. Harvalik : " The rod turns not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man senses a change deep in the earth . " One of Dr. Harvalik 's subjects , a German " master dowser , " is so sensitive he can detect the presence of a field nearly a billionth as weak as the earth 's . Other dowsers can even arrive at depth and flow of underground water , often with uncanny precision . To do this , they mentally ask a series of simple yes and no questions . Each time a " yes " is registered , the rod moves ; a " no " and the rod remains stationary . How does it work ? Perhaps by subtle variations in the magnetic field  --  or perhaps by more esoteric means . More esoteric means , beyond the magnetic field theory , would be needed to explain the apparent success of " long-distance " or " map " dowsing where the dowser is physically far away from the object of his search . In one of the most famous cases on record , documented by American historical novelist Kenneth Roberts , a dowser named Henry Gross spread out a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and passing his divining rod over it , marked three places where fresh water was to be found  --  despite geologists ' conviction that no fresh water existed on the island . To check his findings , Gross and Roberts flew to Bermuda , persuaded the government to provide drilling equipment , and went to work . A few months later , in April 1950 , all three wells had come in as Gross had said they would , providing enough water to free the islands from their exclusive dependence on the rain for water supply . The Clayhouse well alone provided 63,360 gallons daily . Even Dr. Harvalik , who possesses dowsing skills , has experienced something he ca n't explain with his magnetic theory . While he was visiting Australia a few years ago , a member of the Sydney water board challenged him to locate the largest reservoir supplying the city and gauge the depth at the dam . Harvalik agreed to try and , to his amazement , actually pinpointed the direction and distance , which the astonished Australian confirmed . But for depth , Harvalik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian insisted , was seventy-five . Harvalik suggested they visit the reservoir where the two men learned a recent drought had lowered the water  --  to sixty-eight feet exactly . Harvalik can only guess that in addition to a sensitivity to changes in magnetic fields , some dowsers have " something else . " That " something , " according to Dr. Karlis Osis , director of research at the American Society for Psychical Research in New York City , is ESP . " Dowsing is a parapsychological phenomenon , " declares Dr. Osis . It works , he says , because humans unconsciously know a broad spectrum of things that lie beyond the range of normal awareness  --  perhaps through the seventy-five percent of brainpower seemingly unused in everyday life . Some of this information hidden deep in the mind may indirectly filter into consciousness through silent physiological changes demonstrated by an indicator such as a divining rod . " The muscular movements that bend the rod , " explains Dr. Osis , " are the result of this subconscious knowledge we call ESP . It 's like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is moving , but tells nothing about the force that 's making it move . " Like other related phenomena that baffle modern science  --  such as psychic Uri Geller 's strange ability to bend spoons without touching them  --  dowsing is being examined more closely these days . Many dowsers have banded into an organization called the American Society of Dowsers ( ASD ) ? located in Danville , Vermont . Starting with eleven members in 1961 , it has today grown to 1,400 people from all Continued on page 85 35 walks of life : teachers , farmers , doctors , housewives . Each September hundreds of them convene at ASD headquarters in Danville , Vermont , a tiny hamlet forty miles south of the Canadian border , to promote the acceptance of dowsing and discuss its applications . They come by plane from California , Kansas , Texas ; by car from Maine , Massachusetts , Washington , D.C. At last fall 's convention foreign visitors from sister organizations jetted in from as far away as France , Germany , South Africa . Stories are swapped ; new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demonstrations , lessons for beginners and seminars for experts . The townspeople regard the invading witches with curiosity  --  but also with gratitude , for on the field trips , dozens of new wells are located . Thanks to dowsers ' efforts last fall , for example , the little red schoolhouse in nearby Walden , Vermont , now has plenty of water , lacking before . And a farmer in Danville whose well produced only a quart a minute gets twenty-six gallons today . The townspeople also benefit from the tourists who come from miles around to watch the " oddballs " in action . Are they oddballs ? At last year 's convention we asked Maine dowser Bob Ater if he could locate the well on our property in Connecticut , over 300 miles away . He told us to draw a rough map of the property , include any buildings and indicate north . As we handed him the finished sketch he asked , " What about the old foundation over there ? " For a minute we thought we had him  --  and then remembered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved some thirty years ago . We traced it in . Ater picked up a pencil , which he explained acted as a dowsing rod for him , poising it over the map . His hand descended and he marked a neat little circle , just about where the well is . Then he said , " There seems to be something coming out of the house over here . " He drew a snakelike line from the end of the house , along the driveway to the terrace . We stared in disbelief . It was exactly where we had left the garden hose and exactly where we found it when we returned home two days later . Ater has a number of documented map-dowsing feats to his credit , the most intriguing of which happened last summer when two college students got lost in a storm on New Hampshire 's rugged Mount Washington . When he heard the radio bulletin , Ater pulled out a map of the area . His pencil went up one trail , back down again , up another . He called the information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a note from the observer on duty at the time : " The hikers were right where you thought they would be , " he wrote . " Their itinerary matched that outlined on your map . " Luck or coincidence ? Is it self-delusion , wishful thinking , or do some people have mysterious abilities we can not yet explain ? To skeptics  --  and there are many  --  dowsing belongs in the realm of folklore , a charming but useless rural superstition . It does not follow any known rules of science Yet , it does seem to work . We 're not sure if we believe  --  but there is one thing that is certain . Each year , when hundreds of dowsers descend on Danville , for the annual convention , it rains .
