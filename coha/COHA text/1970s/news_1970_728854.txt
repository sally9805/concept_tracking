txt Hamburger : $1 a pound . Pork chops , $1.50 . Porterhouse steak , $2 . Broiler chickens  --  get ' em while they last-45 cents a , pound . Eggs : 85 cents a dozen . Grocery store prices could begin climbing to such astronomical levels in coming months if a fast-spreading corn blight turns out to be as damaging to this year 's crop as some experts predict . Corn is the nation 's most important feed grain , so how much of it there is and what it costs are instrumental in determining the prices of meat , poultry and eggs . Although no one knows for sure how much corn the blight will destroy , some preliminary estimates indicate it could ruin up to half of this year 's predicted crop of 4.7 billion bushels . Even a 25% reduction could lead to grocery prices that would make housewives yearn for those they are paying now . " If our economy turns strong and disposable income continues to mount , a 25% cutback in corn supplies could boost beef prices by 15% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% and broiler chicken prices by at least 30% , " says Norton Smith , an economist for John Morrell &; Co. , a meat packing subsidiary of United Brands Co . Corn Prices Rise Already Leroy A. Wilhelm , president of the Poultry and Egg National Board , a trade group , says egg prices could rise by as much as 35 cents a dozen by early spring from current retail levels of about 50 cents . The blight already has had an impact . In the past three weeks , the Chicago wholesale price of No. 2 yellow corn , a key feed grade , has risen as much as 15% to nearly $1.57 a bushel , the highest in 14 years . Some traders think the price eventually could rise to $2 or more a bushel . Longer-range repercussions also are likely . If less corn results in fewer cattle , hogs and chickens being brought to market , the earnings of meat packers and poultry processors will be hurt . Most of these companies operate on thin profit margins and require large volumes to be efficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blight losses are n't normally covered by crop insurance , and " older farmers with small units could be hit particularly hard , " says a loan officer for the Decatur ( Ill . ) Production Credit Association , an agency that makes loans to farmers . " They were being squeezed before the blight came . " New Form of Old Pest The cause of all this is a new , more virulent form of southern leaf blight , an old fungus pest . Through development of new strains , most corn hybrids have been made resistant to the traditional blight but not to this new form of the fungus . The new blight was first noticed in Midwestern corn fields last year , but it did n't attract much attention because weather conditions last summer were n't right for it to spread very far or do much damage . Plant pathologists say that hot , humid weather helps spread the fungus while cool , . dry weather retards it . This year , the fungus spores have ridden northward on moist , warm winds from the Gulf of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fungus has traveled as far north as Wisconsin . Some farmers say it 's the fastestspreading blight they have ever seen . Nearly all fields in the major corn belt states of Illinois , Iowa and Indiana have shown some sign of the fungus , which starts out as a grayish-tan spot on a corn leaf and grows larger until it kills leaves , parts of the stalk and sometimes the cobs . Once a field is infected , corn production can be cut in two ways . If the blight hits early , when the corn plant is young , the fungus can rot most of its leaves and prevent the ears from forming . If the blight strikes later , it works on the corn stalk . Mature corn ears are n't very susceptible to the blight , but mature stalks are . The fungus can cause them to rot to the point that a stiff wind can blow them over . Combines then ca n't harvest the fallen plants . Nation 's Biggest Producer About 90% of Illinois ' corn fields have been infected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois ; the director of the state 's agriculture department predicts that 25% of the state 's crop could be lost . Last year , Illinois farmers harvested the biggest corn crop of any state , accounting for a fifth of the national total of 4.6 billion bushels . Though it 's obvious that corn production will suffer this year , grain experts are far from unanimous in their estimates of just how bad the damage will be . Some believe the blight may cut this year 's crop by only 5% to 10% . " Losses of 25% to 50% are highly exaggerated , " says T. H. Roberts Jr. , president of DeKalb Agresearch Inc. , a producer of hybrid corn seed . He adds , however , that " we are dealing with a new mutant of an old disease , so no one can be sure what will happen during the critical last week in August or the first week in September . " A grain trade observer summarizes : " The plain fact is , we wo n't know what the total effect of the blight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if blight were n't enough , we 've got drought in the western part of the corn belt , so some more of the crop probably will be lost to that " Corn supplies probably will be stretched somewhat by feeding livestock such substitutes as wheat , rye , oats , grain sorghums and soybean meal . But that extra consumption will cause the prices of these substitutes to rise , too , and this will also lead to higher meat prices . The blight may bring slightly lower prices to the stores for a brief period . This is because some producers , anticipating a feed shortage , might rush their animals to market earlier than usual . The price boosts , however , should come hard and fast after that . Housewives probably will see the increases first in the price of chicken . Partly in anticipation of smaller feed supplies , chicken growers already have begun reducing the number of eggs they are placing in incubators for broiler production . As a result , fewer chickens will be coming to market in late October and November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices to recoup the money they have had to spend in the past few weeks for increasingly expensive corn and soybean meal . " From July 31 to Aug. 17 , higher corn and soybean meal prices raised our production costs by around 3% , " says Frank Wollney , an official of Wayne Poultry Co. , a division of Allied Mills Inc . Prices of some products made directly from corn already have been raised . Last week CPC International Inc. and other processors boosted wholesale corn syrup prices by 8% , following a 6% hike on Aug. 12 , and raised corn starch prices 12% . Meanwhile , many farmers have given up trying to fight the spreading blight . " I did n't bother with spraying because each application would have cost me $5 an acre ; you have to do it four times within a few days and even then there 's no guarantee it will stop the blight , " says Harry Swartz , who runs a Champaign , III. , concern that oversees 20,000 acres of crops , two-thirds of it corn . Mr. Swartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . Higher corn prices will help offset some of this loss , but he says , " I 've never seen a time when farmers have gained by a price rise brought about by acts of nature . In the long run it does more harm than good . " Other farmers are already worrying about planting next year 's crop , since the only sure fire means of controlling blight is by planting hybrids that are resistant to the fungus . Most seed companies claim they will have an adequate supply of such seed to sell next spring , but some of them privately admit that variOigua-iminune to the new strain of blight may be in short supply .
