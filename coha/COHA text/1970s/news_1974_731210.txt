txt While much of the world worries over the " oil crisis , " China is proudly proclaiming that it has an abundance of oil . " Not only self-sufficient , China now has oil for export , " said the Peking journal Red Flag just a few days ago . " The days when China was completely dependent on imported oil are gone forever , " it declared . " Nobody here is talking about an energy crisis , " said another article from Peking in the official newspaper Ta Kung Pao . Of course , China 's oil needs are not comparabl6 to those of fully industrialized countries . China is a country without privately owned automobiles , and the state-owned cars that it does have are relatively few . The world 's most populous nation runs largely on leg and arm power , not on gasoline . But aside from the fact that their needs are few and their ways frugal , the Chinese have another reason to boast . China 's oil production has risen steadily over the past few years . Even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese consider the growth rate to be impressive . One Hong Kong expert goes so far as to call it " sensational . " Premier Chou En-lai was reported to have said that China produced 50 million tons of petroleum in 1973 . That is about 40 percent higher than the estimates that most Western experts had come up with previously . // * China all the oil it needs , and some for export to its friends // But the Chinese fulfilled the agreement and recently signed a new contract with Japan for a 50 percent increase in oil deliveries this year . This will still come to less than 1 percent of Japan 's oil needs . But the Chinese oil industry has great potential for growth . Most important of all , China is believed to have huge offshore oil reserves . Optimistic assessment In the late 1960 's , a report prepared for the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East spoke of the possibility of rich oil deposits lying in the continental shelf off China . The most optimistic assessment came more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's offshore reserves might rival those of the Middle East . At any rate , the Chinese are already producing enough oil to assist them with their foreign policy aims . One of those aims has consistently been to limit the influence of the Soviet Union . The Chinese may think that if they can steadily increase their deliveries of oil to the Japanese , it will reduce the likelihood of Japan 's accepting Soviet proposals for joint Russo-Japanese exploitation of Siberian reserves . The Chinese are not eager to see new Soviet development projects springing up near the northern borders they share with their powerful antagonists . Technical advice The Chinese are interested in importing sophisticated foreign equipment for their oilfields and refineries , and the Japanese seem to have the inside track in this field . They have provided China with a floating drill rig that is operating in the Pohai Bay off Tientsin . A Japanese corporation also has given the Chinese technical advice on the construction of an oil pipeline in northeastern China . But this may be where the Chinese draw the line . While not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress the importance of self-reliance in all their propaganda media . Japanese and American firms have shown an interest in assisting the Chinese In the exploration and development of their oil reserves . But the Chinese say that they do not want joint ventures or help from foreign technicians . The Chinese think that they were overdependent on Soviet aid and technical adviserS in the 1950 's and are not eager to repeat that unhappy experience with any other foreigners .
