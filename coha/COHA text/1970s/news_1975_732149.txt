He said his daughter , captured by the FBI Thursday after being hunted since early 1974 , was thin and pale but clear-eyed when he , his wife , Catherine , and Patty 's two sisters , Anne and Vicky , visited her . " I kissed her on the forehead , " he said . " Patty did n't cry ; neither did her mother . " PATTY , DRESSED in prison blues , exhibited " no signs of nervousness , " he said . However , he noted , she smoked " quite a bit "  --  a habit she acquired since he last saw her . " She really seemed in quite good shape , " he continued . " It was a family get-together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . " But she said she wanted to come home with us . " Hearst said Mrs. Hearst brought her daughter a bouquet of yellow roses . " THE NEWS MEDIA tried to attach a special significance to that , " Mrs. Hearst said , " but I just brought her the roses because all girls love flowers . " She said " Patty let us hug tier and kiss her , and she held the flowers in her lap the whole time . Patty always loved flowers and plants . " Mrs. Hearst said her daughter op. peared to be " in a much better mood than she was on the tapes that we had heard in the past "  --  the tapes on which Patty told of joining the infamous Symbionese Liberation Army , adopting the name " Tanta , " and renouncing her family as " enemies of the people . " MRS . HEARST NOTED that Patty " looked like she has n't seen the sunlight , so pale and drawn . " But Patty 's father described his daughter as " articulate and calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show any outward signs of nervothsness , her fingernails were not bitten , nor did she twitch her legs . " He said he asked Patty if she had kept up exercises prescribed by her doctor for a weak knee . He said she told him , " No but I did try to run a mile every day . " Nslied to describe his feelings at seeing his daughter again , Hearst said , " The main thing is that she did n't get hurt . We never once believed that any law enforcement officer would be so irresponsible as to shoot Patty . We were afraid , however , that she would get herself into a position where there would have to be the use of force . " He said he was " not really surprised " that his daughter was found in the . Bay Area . He said the family meeting lasted for about 40 minutes , and that " we laughed and talked a lot about friends and relatives . " ONE SERIOUS MOMENT came , he said , when her mother asked Patty if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty said , yea , she 'd read about it in the papers , and felt " really terrible " about it . .. Mrs. Hearst noted , " Patty was not vindictive towards us at all . " Patty 's sister , Anne , said to Patty at one point , " I 'd forgotten you 're so small . " Patty laughed and countered , " I 'm 100 pounds . " Did the family ever ask Patty about what she had done and experienced in the 19 months since she was kidnaped from the Berkeley apartment she shared with her then-fiance , Steven Weed ? " No , " said Patty 's mother , " We stayed away from that . We wanted this to be a family thing . " PATTY 'S FATHER observed : " I 'm happy the fugitive stage is over . Now she goes into the court stage . We 've asked for a reduction in her bail which was set at more than $1 million . I understand the bail reduction will not be opposed by the federal attorney , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe she will have to go to Los Angeles , too , to get the bail reduced there . " He said Mrs. Hearst and he had tried to see Patty Immediately , but were turned down by the FBI . Not until Patty herself requested that she be allowed to see her parents was permission granted . DESPITE HER SHOW of warmth towards her parents , Patty made it clear that she has not abandoned her revolutionary zeal . Her attorney , Terrence Hallinan , said she requested a message be sent to her radical comrades , " Tell everybody that she 's smiling , that she feels free and strong , and sends her greetings to the brothers and sisters out there , " he said the message read . Patty defiantly signed the jail booking sheet with the alias " Tanis " ? her SLA name . And in the space for " occupation , " she wrote , " Self-employed urban guerrilla . "
