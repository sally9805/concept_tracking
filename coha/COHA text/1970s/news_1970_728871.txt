txt Jerome Kretchmer , the city 's Environmental Protection Administrator , said yesterday that the city was cleaner than it was a month ago and that within 60 days there would be such an improvement that it would be visible all over . the city . He said in a two-hour interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times that the improvement would come from the addition of some 1,000 men to the department and from new machines and equipment , such as improved trash baskets . His Career Mentioned Mr. Kretchmer has been filling in as Acting Sanitation Commissioner , and he said he expected to continue running the Sanitation Department personally for at least the next two months because of the difficulty of finding a new Commissioner . The previous Commissioner , Griswold L. Moeller , resigned last July , and Mr. Kretchmer said it shad been difficult to find someone to handle the sensitive post . Mr. Kretchmer agreed that if he did accomplish the job of getting the city cleaner , it require cars to be parked in the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave both curbs free for street cleaning . CA proposal will be made to set up an " environmental court " to handle sanitation and other pollution violations administratively , so that prosecutions would not be bogged down in the present courts . ( Although he is putting strong faith in newly designed trash baskets , old 55-gallon steel drums with their tops cut off may be the answer to the container problem , because they would not be so attractive to thieves , who have made off with thousands of the . city 's wire-mesh baskets . ( Reports of sanitation truck breakdowns have been common because the magnitude of the refuse-collection job requires that the trucks be worked longer ? " We work our trucks from 6 in the morning to midnight ; private outfit does that " Stress on Mechanical Aids . Mr. Kretchmer did not say how the department 's new manpower , announced earlier this year , would be deployed in the cleanup operation . There have been suggestions that manual sweeping is the only way the streets will ever be made really clean . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? who he . said earned an average of $10,500 a year with overtime ? was becoming prohibitive . He intends to rely heavily on mechanical aids to extend his manpower . One of these . aids he was especially enthusiastic about was a three-wheeled ' motor scooter with a dump body , on which a sanitationman rides from street to street . The man still uses a hand broom to sweep up litter when he sees it , but he ' shovels it onto the scooter and does not waste time walking and . pushing ' a conventional wheeled barrel from one litter pile to another . Five of the scooters are in use now on an experimental basis and , if the test proves successful , 165 will be ordered to cover the whole city . Mr. Kretchmer sees a large part of his -. job as trying to get people more concerned about not littering and having respect for the job of the Sanitation Department . In discussing the scooters , he became especially bitter about " the disrespect of some people toward their town . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small scooters when they stopped at the curb , with no concern for the scooter or its driver . ' Our No. 1 Problem ' Mr. Kretchmer was sworn into his job as Administrator of the superagency , which includes the Department of Air Resources and the Department of Water Resources as well as Sanitation , last May 1 . He said the Mayor had emphasized that " getting the streets clean and getting the city cleaned up is our No. 1 problem . " The Mayor , Mr. Kretchmer said , " is a nut on keeping the streets clean ? he 'll call you up at all hours of the day or night about some dirty street he 's seen . " In an effort to clean the streets , Mr. Kretchmer said : " I told the Mayor the day after I took the job that I would produce a new trash basket . Now I 'm on the verge of dog it . " He said a dozen . experimental baskets would be delivered within the next 10 days . To prevent theft , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 80 pounds of concrete in their bases . They will have plastic liners that can be removed by sanitationmen for emptying . 2-Month Experiment . Due Two hundred baskets eventually will be used in the experiment , which will last " a couple of months . " If those tests are , successful , 40,000 new ' baskets could be on the streets in six to eight months , Kretchmer said . The baskets would be painted blue and orange , the city 's colors , and perhaps have private ? advertising on at ; least three sides to defray the cost of the equipment , the Administrator said . Already , Mr. Kretchmer said , there has been enthusiastic response from advertisers who want to use the baskets . To overcome the garbage problem in the slums , which he blamed on landlords , Mr. Kretchmer said collections had been increased to as much as eight times a week to make up for the lack of containers . He said the added collections were necessary because it was often impossible to find a landlord and make him provide containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , Mr. Kretchmer said , he is often given only a token fine of $5  --  and that after long delays because of court backlogs . This is one reason , he said , he wants to set up an environmental court with offices in each borough . Fines could then be levied quickly and bear some relation to the cost to the city , he argued . The new court would require approval from the State Legislature , and a request for such approval is being prepared . On automobiles , Mr. Kretchmer said the A.A.A. had great lobbying power because the car was such an important possession . Refusal to Move Cars People all over the city want clean streets , but they do not want to move their cars so the streets can be cleaned , Mr. Kretchmer said . " To the ghetto resident , the car is really a sacred thing , " he added . " They fuss over them all day . It 's a great social activity . " Although Mr. Kretchmer mentioned only the reluctance about physical examinations , others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hugh Marius , the assistant administrator for citizen involvement in Mr. Kretchmer 's superagency , says that for someone who is black and has been denied opportunity for a long time , the idea of being a garbageman is not especially attractive . He says blacks want jobs with more prestige . Mr. Marius , who is black , says : " It 's like going out and buying big Buicks and Cadil. lacs , because having some outward status symbol is inordinately important after years of oppression . " would help his ambition to run for higher political office . His name has been mentioned as a contender for Mayor , but he declined to name any specific office he was seeking . " We 'll wait and see what happens , " he said . These are some of the other points made by Mr. Kretchmer in the interview : Slums have become a special problem because sanitationmen have had to take over burdens that are really the landlord 's , in collecting large amounts of garbage that spill because the owner has not provided proper containers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Puerto Rican slums because of the high density of population there , it has been hard to get people from these areas into sanitationmen 's jobs , partly because they do n't , take the physical examination ' seriously . " The Irish will practice up with ' barbells for months , " Mr. Kietchner said . ( Marked automobiles are a major* hindrance to street cleaning , but it is difficult to do anything about them because-pie American Automobile Association is " a lobby that is powerful out of proportion to its membership .
