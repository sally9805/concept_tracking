It was one of those incredible moments in history when everything seemed to be happening at once . Twenty-five years ago this week , as the war in Europe rolled toward its end , the rulers of two of the Axis powers died violently , scarcely 48 hours apart . Benito Mussolini perished on April 28 , 1945 , executed by a Communist partisan as he tried to flee Italy . Adolf Hitler died in Berlin on April 30 , apparently by swallowing a cyanide capsule . On the double anniversary , TIME 's Benjamin Cate in Bonn and James Bell in Rome examine the ways in which the two are remembered : <P> <P> He Built the Autobahnen , But . . . <P> <P> In both East and West Germany , the egomaniacal Fhrer has become something of a nonperson . The East Germans rather self-righteously disclaim any role or responsibility for the Nazi years : after all , they are Communists , and Hitler was the rotten fruit of a decaying capitalist system . For the West Germans , coming to terms with that era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-story stucco house at Vorstadt 219 in the Austrian border town of Braunau am Inn , is no longer marked as a shrine ; only informed visitors can pick it out . His Alpine retreat at Obersalzberg , which survived the war , was dynamited by the Bavarian government . The remains of the dynamited Fhrerbunker , a concrete redoubt and command post beneath the Reich Chancellery , are now a grassy mound , situated fittingly enough in the narrow , 110-yd. corridor of no man 's land between East and West Berlin . Countless Adolf Hitler squares or streets in German cities and towns have been renamed , often in honor of such heroes of the plots to overthrow him as Klaus von Stauffenberg , Julius Leber and Lutheran Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer . Adolf , once a popular name , is seldom bestowed on German children today . About the only lasting memento is the 1,800 miles of modern autobahnen Hitler built , but even these highways have been broadened , resurfaced and extended beyond recognition . <P> According to a recent poll , only 6% of West Germans said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-time list of effective German statesmen , he is steadily slipping . In 1950 , Bismarck topped the list with 35% of the votes , and Hitler received 10% . Three years ago , in the last such sampling , Konrad Adenauer received 60% and Hitler , with 2% , barely edged out Frederick the Great . <P> Demonic Evils . Only one-third of today 's West Germans were even teen-agers before World War II . Those born after the war show little interest in the Nazi era and , naturally , accept no responsibility for it . Those between 30 and 50 , says Historian Joachim Fest , are " the generation of self-reproach . " Many of them insist that Hitler accomplished some good-reviving the economy , building national self-esteem and cracking class barriers-but they concede that his achievements were more than canceled out by the demonic evils of Nazism . But many of those over 50 , who remember the humiliation after World War I and the chaos of the Weimar Republic , maintain that Hitler 's positive accomplishments outweigh the negative . The memoirs of Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still a bestseller in West Germany eight months after publication ( TIME , Sept. 12 , 1969 ) .
