" Tip O'Neill can communicate more with a wink and a nod than most politicians can in a two-hour speech . He 's one of the great leaders of our time , not just because he 's from Massachusetts , or just because he 's Irish . But that 's part of the reason . Anybody who knows his district , which includes , on one hand , Harvard and MIT. , and on the other , East Cambridge , should not be surprised at the success he has had in winning the support of all factions of the House of Representatives  --  freshmen and veterans , Northerners and Southerners , liberals and conservatives . There is no doubt in my mind that he will go down in history as one of the greatest Speakers the House has ever had . " ? Senator Edward M. Kennedy When he lumbers toward you , it 's a hulk ( 6 feet , 3 inches , and 250 pounds ) of a man , preceded by a pink , bulbous nose that quickly leads to small , deep-set blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. C. Fields floridity is topped off with a shock of white hair , one lock of which is sure to fall across the broad brow . A handshake sticks out of the blue suit , and if a bearlike arm wraps around you , it is likely in search of a favor , maybe even a vote . What also has come at you is 42 years of Democratic politics of the Massachusetts Irish Catholic kind , an insistence on fierce loyalty that can be traced to a historic Irish distrust of the British and an unrelenting partisanship that makes Republicans grate their teeth . Thomas P. " Tip " O'Neill , Jr. , 66 , is the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives , a body of 435 citizens who , since the fallof once powerful men ( Lyndon Johnson , Richard M. Nixon , and a dozen tyrannical congressional committee chairmen ) is not inclined to submit to anyone 's discipline . This is a reality O'Neill appreciates , since he would love to practice the iron-hand leadership for which his predecessor-hero , Sam Rayburn , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the Massachusetts legislature decades ago . To grow up , as Tip did , in Massachusetts Irish politics , is to learn to " go along , " and this is why this graduate ward-heeler goes against much of his deep-seated self to get as much as he can out of House members . He is an old-fashioned traditionalist who accommodateshimself to a band of younger and rather secular-minded men and women who never took baskets to the deserving poor at Christmas or much worried who got jobs shoveling snow when times were hard . O'Neill does , because he grew up the son of a bricklayer who once picketed Harvard University for hiring scabs , and soon learned who the enemy was  --  the then dominant owner class of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants who were also Republicans . Politics was the way to conquer them , and ultimately Irish politics did in Massachusetts . And so O'Neill relishes being around vestigial old pots , sharing their cigar smoke and back-slapping stories and tales of political war . Tip loves to wallow in people , regardless of party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he recognizes that to lead he must operate within what is today , and he does that . As a devout Roman Catholic who never misses Mass on Sunday or a Holy Day of Obligation , O'Neill still opposes tuition tax-credits which would help nonpublic , therefore Roman Catholic , schools . He shudders at the thought of a woman having an abortion , but makes it clear that he would never use his vast power to interfere with any legislative effort to liberalize abortion . He respects and regards women as madonnas , though he vigorously pushes any legislation advancing equal rights for women because " our side wants it . " Though pot Continued on following page . appalls him , he would never speak a critical word to those few House members reported to have smoked it . The taint of scandal hovered near him during the flare-up of publicity around Tongsun Park , the Korean bagman and dispenser of favors to congressmen , but nothing felonious was proved on Tip . He angrily brushes aside any probing questions about his financial affairs  --  though many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean bill of health . Being a successful anachronism carries its pains and longings . Sure , he enjoys the deference paid him in public as " Mr. Speaker " and the way the old gang around Duke Zeibert 's macho eatery in Washington homes toward him at that moment after a meal when the coffee needs warming up and the brandy is poured . But days on the Hill are increasingly difficult . The members are generally an independent-minded lot , mindful of how a five percent constituency ( a pressure group ) can knock off a candidate . Party discipline does n't mean that much . Then there 's the Carter White House , whose congressional liaison people cause Tip to grieve . And there are impudent young men like the departed Bruce Caputo who audaciously questioned Tip 's integrity , thus causing grievous offense to his deeply ingrained notion that loyalty must be absolute . Tip would have thrived andenjoyed it all the more if he had been Speaker 15 to 20 years ago . " There 's no question that it would have been easier being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me late one afternoon after a rather grueling day . " Or under Johnson , who was the master . What this Carter White House lacks is a strong voice to get something done . I think there is the feeling down there that they do n't want to create a Haldeman . " In the Kennedy and Johnson days , the members were used to a different system . We had the Irish Mafia  --  Larry O'Brien , Kenny O'Donnell , Dick McGuire , Dick Donahue , and Dave Powers  --  guys who told the members , ' We want you reelected and we 're working for you . ' " It was all outgoing . These were n't the guys who came up here with a chip on their shoulders , like they came from running the Georgia legislature . " Tip 's relationship with Carter did n't get off to an auspicious beginning . In their first conversation after Carter was elected , the President impressed on Tip how he had gone over the heads of the Georgia legislature , directly to the people . But Tip was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . He knew the mood of Congress , and after all , he had pushed along the impeachment proceeding on Nixon when others blanched at the idea . Tip reminded President Carter that the289 House Democrats ran against the Ford administration and would run against him if they felt like it . The way Tip tells it , Carter airily dismissed the prospect by casually remarking , " Oh , really ? " But little by little , as he and Carter had one-on-one meetings in the White House , Carter broke down Tip 's reservations about the Protestant President with the markedly Southern accent . By the spring of 1978 , with a commendable list of legislative victories under his belt , Tip actually went around Congress and his district raving about how " beautiful a guy " Carter was . There have been ups and downs since , particularly over the way the White House handled the firing of Tip 's old buddy from Cambridge , Robert Griffin , but Tip is willing to live and let live now . However , he wo n't let up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in a new relationship with any President  --  Democrat or Republican  --  with Congress reasserting its power . But for all his discourse on how open Congress is now , O'Neill is the most partisan Speaker in anyone 's memory in Washington . When he holds the gavel Republicans squirm , for this two-to-one minority knows he can look over their heads and ignore their request for the floor . In the spring of 1978 , O'Neill brazenly tried to ram through changes in the federal Continued on following page election law that would have virtually destroyed political action committees of the conservative or probusiness persuasion , the same kind of PAC 's that labor unions have used for many years to defeat Republican candidates . House Minority Leader John Rhodes ( R. , Arizona ) , while often complaining about Tip 's blatant partisanship , sometimes flinches when O'Neill lets loose with a power blast , but this time , he stood firm . The Democrat measure was defeated , in no small way , because Republican Bob Bauman ( R. , Maryland ) got 50 G.O.P. House members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritates Tip , the name " Caputo " ( now a former congressman ) causes his eyes to cross in anger . When Bruce Caputo ( a member of the Dutch Reformed Church , though his grandfather was an Italian Catholic iceman in the Bronx ) was a freshly elected congressman , he became disgusted with what he regarded as a " coverup " in investigation of Korean influence-buying in Congress . Caputo ( in conversations with newsmen ) insisted that the Speaker was n't using the full force of his office to move the investigations and might , indeed , have something to hide himself . One story got out that Caputo claimed that Tongsun Park used O'Neill 's office as a hangout . Caputo had already been spit on at a cocktail party by a congressman angry with the freshman 's audacious probing into the Korean matter . But he got his real shock when Tip , submitting himself to a rare TV interview , exploded . " I have no confidence in him , " he said of Caputo . " From what I 've been told he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of his colleagues , who check to see if they are out cheating on their wives , who check to see if they go on corporate planes . " If he . . . wants to have his employees do that . . . does he have any respect for his fellow-man ? No ! His fellow congressmen ? No ! He leaked everything .. . and he exaggerated . " Caputo coolly responded that he regretted O'Neill 's " defamatory statements , which he himself describes as hearsay . " He also denied asking any staffer to collect information as O'Neill described and challenged the Speaker to name the staff members he was accusing . " On reflection , " O'Neill said a few days later , " I feel I should not have uttered the personal remarks . " The big bear nursed his wounds for a while . Tip can get ornery , but only after he has failed with a dose of Irish good humor . " It 's very difficult not to like Tip O'Neill , " a Republican congressman admits . Tip tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitive and seemingly by rote , i.e. , " an able , talented , and hard-working member . " The substance of Tip O'Neill is dealing with people . And because Congress is afflicted with ten times more work than it was a generation ago when Tip first arrived , he is forever being plucked at by people . So , if it 's an energybill , for Tip , that means moving it , not determining whether it 's sound . He must accept other people 's judgments . Even when he meets with the press , according to one regular , " it 's usually more friendly than informative . It 's more how he 's going to do it than what the bill means . Sometimes he just plain does n't know . " Still , as Congressman Tom Foley , one of Tip 's close friends , says , " Tip does pretty well because of his great knowledge of the House . Tip knows the members do n't want the committee chairmen to determine what the legislation will be , so he does n't let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quick look at the record shows that in 1977 , the House passed the energy bill while the Senate dawdled with it , and it also enacted legislation on congressional ethics , Comprehensive Employment Training Administration ( CETA ) , and a new minimum wage . In 1978 Congress lifted the embargo on arms sales to Turkey , startled even Tip by approving Civil Service Reform , and voted for a modest tax cut and labor-law reform . But in this two-year period , Tip and the ad-ministration lost on votes on Common Situs picketing , a consumer af-fairs agency , public fi-nancing of congressional campaigns , instant voter registra-tion , and what many thought was a payoff by the Carter administra-tion to the maritime industry and unions  --  the cargo preference bill . All in all , O'Neill was given good marks for his first two years as Speaker . But they just do n't make congressmen like they used to , namely , the kind who are loyal to party and respectful of a Speaker 's ultimate power . Besides , Tip did n't have the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liason with Congress . " There is still a prosecutorial atContinued on following page mosphere around here coming out of Watergate , " Tip complained when I asked him how come so many questions were being raised about his private finances . " Ever since Woodward and Bernstein , there are all these reporters trying to be like them and nail people . " Had there been no Watergate , there might not have been a Koreagate . Influence-buying in Washington is an old story , most of it buried by time . As it was , when it was revealed in early 1976 that Tongsun Park , a popular social figure in the Capitol , had dispensed favors and money to congressmen , there was only a ripple . Tip , of course , had two enormous birthday parties given for him by Park and had accepted an expensive set of golf clubs and some charming hurricane lamps as well from the Korean man about town . Total value , as later determined : $8,000 . With rumors about that 115 present or former members of Congress , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly motivated to pursue sin , as , say , he had in trying to hang Nixon during Watergate . Tip runs the Congress , which means he had much to say about how the committee investigating the Korean scandal would proceed and at what pace . The committee , headed by John J. Flynt , Jr. , a turgid Southerner , became known as a suitable station for taking long naps . Its only disturber of the peace was Caputo , whose youthful appearance made him look like a recent high school graduate in search of a college . On and on it dragged , until the summer of 1977 ( 18 months after the first revelation ) when the committee 's chief investigator , Philip A. Lacovara , a hero-sleuth during Watergate , resigned in exasperation , claiming there was impossible foot-dragging in the probe . Suddenly , there was a ground swell of demand for action in the Congress , mostly from younger , Class of ' 74 members who did n't want to be brushed with older members ' tar . Tip is no fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethics and then allow an investigation of congressmen to be stymied . Besides , some members were calling for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor , Watergate-style . Tip 's pulse quickened . He quickly met with the six Democrats on the Ethics Commitee to discuss new rules by which the new Chief Investigator could proceed , and then had a long session with Flynt to get his approval of the plan . Leon Jaworski , the Watergate prosecutor , was hired to replace Lacovara . If Jaworski cut through the Nixon administration like a hot knife through butter , he was scraping a stone wall during Koreagate . It seemed the only names that surfaced were those of former or dead congressmen , or Koreans whose names were quite forgettable  --  Tongsun Park excepted . Jaworski , too , became exasperated and resigned in the summer of 1978 . Meanwhile , the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , a pompous-sounding body , issued a report clearing O'Neill and Brademas but charging McFall and three other Democrats with unethical conduct . The report stated that O'Neill acted with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't recommend disciplinary action . It noted , however , in chiding fashion , that " .. . judged by today 's standards , it may be unwise for an important congressman O'Neill to permit either a foreigner or a suspected lobbyist to give him a party . " The fact is that the U.S. Constitution expressly forbids any member of Congress to accept gifts from foreign officials . But O'Neill and others argued that when they accepted Park 's goodies , they were not aware he was an agent of a foreign government . Another touchy area is Tip 's friendship with Robert T. Griffin , a high-level bureaucrat , who became embroiled in an in-house dispute at the General Services Ad-ministration , the powerful federal agency that spends $5 billion a year . This flap caused Tip to become very angry at the Carter White House and showed how the Georgians had no understanding of loyalty as Tip practiced it . " No question I was mad , " Tip said after he finally cooled off . " I was n't informed . I was n't given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired from his $50,000-a-year job at GSA , ostensibly because he was n't competent to serve Jay Solomon . But then the White House turned around and hired him at $50,000 a year to be assistant to trade specialist Robert Strauss . In the weeks following , however , as a widespread scandal at GSA was revealed , Solomon 's friends claimed that Griffin was a foot-dragger whose views prevented overdue reform . The O'Neill name is a door-opener in Washington . When a $40 million demonstration housing project , sponsored by the Housing and Urban Development Departmeet , got bogged down , young Tommy O'Neill , Tip 's son and lieutenant governor of Massachusetts , phoned HUD Secretary Patricia Harris and got satisfaction . When corporate executives in Massachusetts become ensnarled in federal red tape , they often call on young O'Neill for help . Tommy actually gets so many requests to intervene that he has assigned his codirector the job of taking business executives around to meet the " right people " in Washington . " What is good for corporations is often good for our state , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likes business well enough that he got into it himself with Tong-sun Park . In 1972-73 , before he was lieutenant governor , O'Neill served with Park on the board of directors of the McLaughlin Fisheries . But young O'Neill 's office explained that " Tommy did n't know Tongsun Park from Fenway Park " ( where the Red Sox play ) and " never met or talked with Park . " Tommy quit the board when he ran for lieutenant governor . If some righteous politician had friends like Robert Griffin or a son like Tommy in the lobbying business , there would no doubt be all manner of protest by Pecksniffians , and the politician would not be able to work his will . Tip does , however , and a documentary produced and broadcast by Boston 's Public Broadcast System station , WGBH-TV , is a good example of how he succeeds . Titled " Mr. Speaker : A Portrait of Tip O'Neill , " it came off as a one-sided picture indeed . Just as there was hometown Boston adulation for the portrait of Tip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Globe 's David B. Wilson , who wrote : " If House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill , Jr. , had commissioned the program .. . and had exercised artistic control , he could not have produced a more flattering campaign film ... . " But even the least partisan observer may question whether it is appropriate for a nonprofit educational institution , funded with tax-deductive contributions , tax-sheltered foundation grants , and appropriated public money , to underwrite a program which , for all its artistic merit , amounts to a dazzling campaign puff piece . " A Washington Post review , by Mary Russell , concluded the program was not a " serious documentary " but rather " a totally uncritical look , " and she observed , " ... there 's never a hint that O'Neill himself was involved in the Korean scandal , although he was given parties and gifts by the central figure in the investigation , Korean businessman Tongsun Park . O'Neill looks good , perhaps because the special was made by his hometown station , perhaps because he controlled access of the filmmakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Tip O'Neill came through , " He is an unfailingly human , likable man , warm , blunt , schmaltzy , not good on detail but decisive . There is grit to his character , but no artifice " is what Mary Russell wrote . Indeed , that is why Tip O'Neill has been a marvelous success as a politician and has been able to work his will as Speaker in an era when authority is resisted in Congress .
