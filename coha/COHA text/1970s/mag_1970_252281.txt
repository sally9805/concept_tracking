Verismo Revisited " When they asked me if I could come to the Metropolitan Opera at the last moment , I said it was out of the question , of course I could n't do it , so just forget it . But Franco pleaded , so I said ' Let me look at the scores . ' And 1 really fell in love with Cavalleria . " <P> The speaker was Conductor Leonard Bernstein , and Franco is Designer-Director Franco Zeffirelli . The result of their talks created the first great occasion at the Met since it opened its season after a disastrous delay-a brand-new production of Cav and Pag ( Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci ) , opera 's beloved twin chestnuts , flossily refurbished . Though Bernstein 's demanding schedule only permitted him to conduct Cav ( Met Conductor Fausto Cleva did Pag ) , the night promised to be one to remember . Bernstein and Zeffirelli , after all , in 1964 had helped turn the Met 's Falstaff into the recent decade 's most breathtaking operatic experience . Alas , this time out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peculiar Magic . Much of the trouble lay with the operas . Verdi 's Falstaff , with its quicksilver score and its well-drawn characters , is a director 's and a conductor 's dream . Cav and Pag are genre pieces in a style known as verismo ( truthful ) to distinguish their homely subject matter from the myths and legends fashionable at the time . <P> When Cav and Pag came out in the 1890s , there was a certain honesty in creating grand opera about common peopie . To go on captivating audiences today , such operas do not need modernizing . They need the courage of their own melodramatic convictions , overwhelming the audience with old-fashioned breast beating , hair pulling and singing that soars and thrills . <P> In the new Cav , however , Bernstein fell in love with Composer Pietro Mascagni 's original score , which calls for much slower tempos than the opera customarily is given . ( His performance ran a full ten minutes longer than the normal 70 minutes . ) Tension and excitement drained away as Tenor Franco Corelli and Soprano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , concentrating on breathing deeply to manage the long phrases . <P> Rise from the Deadly . Zeffirelli 's Sicilian setting was full of church steps and free of novelty . His Pagliacci included a dusty road , a gnarled tree , a brilliant sunset and a great deal of lively Method movement . Here , if the pace was present , the voices were lacking . Dynamic Soprano Teresa Stratas fell sick and had to be replaced at the last minute . Veteran Tenor Richard Tucker had neither the warmth nor the fire to create dislike in the audience and then transform it into pity . Only Baritone Sherrill Milnes as the deformed Tonio had the strong , rich reserves of voice and tone that can raise Pagliacci from the deadly . <P> " Today , you know , " Zeffirelli said , commenting on his straightforward conception of the productions , " it takes more courage to be conservative in a healthy way than to be revolutionary . " Very true . But to be healthy , Italian opera needs passion too .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
