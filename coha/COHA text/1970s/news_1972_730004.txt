txt Birth rates among lower-income women ' declined so sharply , in the . late nineteen-sixties that they bore a million fewer children than they would have ' at the earlier rates , according to a new private study of Census Bureau data . In percentage terms , the decline in rates for poorer women ? those with family incomes under $5,000 ? was 21 per cent , only a little greater than the 18 per cent decline for others . And the rates for poorer women ' remained significantly higher than the rate for the population as a whole . But in absolute terms , the study- showed a significant nar ( rowing of the historic divergence between the fertility rates of poorer and richer , women . The number of babies born to the poorer group dropped nearly twice as fast-32 fewer babies per thousand compared to- 17 fewer among more affluent women . The change was even steeper among poor black women . They // had 49 fewer babies per thou'sand in the late sixties . The study was conducted by Planned Parenthood - World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation for the . findings Is the availability to the poor of better contraceptives , Frederick S. Jaffe , the author of the study , said today in an Interview . " When it comes to contraception , most everybody in the United States does something . The difference is that lower-income women have been depending on the least effective methods . Since 1967 , more effective methods have become increasingly available to them . " The acceleration of Federal assistance was evidenced today In . President Nixon 's special message on health to Congress . In 1968 , Federal family planning spending totaled $15-million . The President called today for a spending level in ' 1973 Of $248-million . The new study is one of a series of current indications that the nation 's population growth rate Is declining significantly . Another , to be distributed this week , Is the provisional 1971 report of the National Center for . Health Statistics . It shows that total births declined 4 per cent , from the 1970 total even though the number of potential mothers in the population increased . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed , analysts estimate there would have been 413,000 more . The provisional figures also showed a crude birth rate of 17.3 , the lowest corrected rate on record . The crude birth rate is the number of births per thousand people . The , figures included a general fertility rate of 82,3 , the lowest since the late nineteen thirties . The general fertility rate is the number of births per thousand women of childbearing age ( 15 to 44 ) . Census Bureau analysts estimate that these figures would translate into a total fertility rate of 2.284 children per mother ' That would be the lowest , , , since the mid-thirties , when- ' was 2.235 . The rate needed to maintain the population is 2.110 . The Planned Parenthood analysis showed that between 1960 and 1965 the general fertility ' rate among women with incomes above $5,000 was 98 babies per thousand women . This fell to 81 between 1966 and 1970 . This represented an 18 per cent decline . 21 Per Cent Decline Meanwhile , the rate among poorer women fell from 153 to 121 babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the poorest black women the rate dropped from 186 to 137 births per thousand , a 26 per cent decline . The category covered women with incomes below the Federal poverty level , $3,968 a year . Over-all , Mr. Jaffe said , " if the 6,682,000g women aged 15 to 44 classified as poor and near-poor had experienced the same fertility rate for 1966.70 as for 1960.65 , they would have had 1,065,000 more births than they actually had over this five-year period . " In his assessment , Mr. Jaffe said he had found two distinct patterns of fertility in the late sixties , one in which the average was about 120 births per thousand , the other about 69 . But the dividing line , he said , was'not poverty-level income . The high fertility level extends up to families with incomes of about $8,000 a year . This , Mr. Jaffe contended , shows a need for augmented Federal and private family planning activity . Many programs now limit assistance to the poorest of farniifes , but improved fertility control , he said , is critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Family planning services generally make birth control pills and intrauterine devices available to their patients . Increased abortions are not thovgilt relevant to the Planned Parenthood findings . General liberalization of abortion laws did not begin until about 1970.
