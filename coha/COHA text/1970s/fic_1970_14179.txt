SILENCE . Pitch blackness . Animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness . Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting . A SINGER is heard singing the first bars of " All God 's Chillun Got Shoes . " HAROLD , LOOSELEAF , PENELOPE , and WOODLY stand in a row in the darkness , facing the audience . They are motionless . A city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows . The lights come up on the living room of a rich man 's apartment , which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars . There is a front door , a door to the master bedroom suite , and a corridor leading to other bedrooms , the kitchen and so on . PENELOPE How do you do . My name is Penelope Ryan . This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing  --  and those who do n't . HAROLD I am Harold Ryan , her husband . I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts  --  as a professional soldiers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . WOODLY I am Dr. Norbert Woodly  --  a physician , a healer . I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should still be a respected member of society . Gentleness must replace violence everywhere , or we are doomed . p. 3 PENELOPE To LOOSELEAFWould you like to say something about killing , Colonel ? LOOSELEAF EmbarrassedJesus  --  I du n no . You know . What the heck . Who knows ? PENELOPE Colonel Harper , retired now , dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War , killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash . LOOSELEAF I du n no , boy . PENELOPE You do n't know ? LOOSELEAF It was a bitch . PENELOPE Thank you . To allYou can leave now . We 'll begin . WOODLY To the audience , making a peace signPeace !

Hyena laughsMy husband , who kills so much , has been missing for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon Rain Forest , where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes . His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper , who dropped the bomb on Nagasaki . Hyena laughsI should explain the doorbells in this apartment . They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch . They are actual recordings of animal cries . The back doorbell is a hyena , which you 've just heard . The front doorbell is a lion 's roar . To the wingsWould you let them hear it please ? Lion roarsThank you . PAUL , her twelve-year-old son , enters from corridor , a sensitive , neatly dressed little rich boyAnd this is my son , Paul . He was only four years old when his father disappeared . p. 4 PAUL Radiantly , sappilyHe 's coming back , Mom ! He 's the bravest , most wonderful man who ever lived .

PENELOPE ResentfullyThank you , kind sir . PAUL A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor . p. 5 PENELOPE A what kind of doctor ? PAUL A fairy  --  a queer . Everybody in the building knows he 's a queer . PENELOPE Knowing betterThat 's an interesting piece of news . PAUL You 're the only woman he ever took out . PENELOPE Not true . PAUL Still lives with his mother . PENELOPE You know she has no feet ! You want him to abandon his mother , who has no husband , who has no money of her own , who has no feet ? PAUL How did she lose her feet ? PENELOPE In a railroad accident many years ago . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning practice . A real man would have sold her to a catfood company , I suppose . As far as that goes , J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother . PAUL I did n't know that . PENELOPE A lot of people do n't . PAUL J. Edgar Hoover plays sports . PENELOPE I do n't really know . p. 6 PAUL The only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign . He makes the peace sign and says the word effeminatelyPeace . Peace . Peace , everybody . Lion doorbell roars PENELOPE CringingI hate that thing . PAUL It 's beautiful . He goes to door , admits WOODLY , whom he loathes openly WOODLY Wearing street clothes , carrying a rolled-up poster under his armPeace , everybody  --  Paul , Penelope .

WOODLY I 'm glad somebody finally cried . Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death , I want to cry . Winking at PAUL , acknowledging PAUL 'S low opinion of him I do n't cry , of course . Not manly , you know . Did she try antihistamines ? PENELOPE They made her so sleepy she could n't work . WOODLY Throw out all this junk . Burn it ! This room crawls with tropical disease . PAUL Everything stays as it is ! WOODLY A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat . PAUL HotlyMy father ! WOODLY I apologize . But you did n't know him , and neither did I.

PENELOPE Reading " War is not healthy for children and other living things . " How lovely . WOODLY No doubt Paul thinks it stinks . Lion doorbell roarsI hate that thing . PAUL Going to the doorKeeps fairies away ! He admits HERB SHUTTLE , who carries an Electrolux vacuum cleaner SHUTTLE To PAUL affectionately , touching himHi kid .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't everybody be nice to everybody else while I 'm gone ? All freeze , except for PENELOPE , who comes forward to address the audience . Lights on set fade as spotlight comes onMost men shunned me  --  even when I nearly swooned for want of love . I might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt . My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire , but of Harold 's lethal reputation . SHUTTLE comes into the spotlight SHUTTLE I keep having this nightmare  --  that he catches us . PENELOPE Doing what ? SHUTTLE He 'd kill me . He 'd be right to kill me , too  --  the kind of guy he is . PENELOPE Or was . We have n't done anything wrong , you know . SHUTTLE He 'd assume we had . PENELOPE That 's something , I suppose . SHUTTLE All through the day I 'm so confident . That 's why I 'm such a good salesman , you know ? I have confidence , and I look like I have confidence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find out I 'm a vacuum cleaner salesman . They stop laughing , though , when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year . I 've got six other salesmen working under me , and what they all plug into is my confidence . That 's what charges them up . p. 10 PENELOPE I 'm glad . SHUTTLE I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University . PENELOPE I know . SHUTTLE If you want to wrestle , you go to Lehigh . If you want to play tennis , you go to Vanderbilt . PENELOPE I do n't want to go to Vanderbilt . SHUTTLE You do n't wrestle if you do n't have supreme confidence , and I wrestled . But when I get with you , and I say to myself , " My God  --  here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan , one of the great heroes of all time  --  " Pause PENELOPE Yes ? SHUTTLE Something happens to my confidence . PENELOPE To the audienceThis conversation took place , incidentally , about three months before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely out of the picture , Penelope , when I do n't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong , I 'm going to ask you to be my wife . PENELOPE I 'm touched . SHUTTLE That 's when I 'll get my confidence back . p. 11 PENELOPE I see . SHUTTLE If you 'll pardon the expression , that 's when you 'll see the fur and feathers fly . Good night . PENELOPE Good night . Blackout p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO SHUTTLE and WOODLY argue in pitch darkness , with PAUL listening , and lights come up gradually to full on the living room the same evening .

WOODLY Which we do . But we can stop doing that . The lights are full . SHUTTLE and WOODLY are bored with each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener who has more brains than SHUTTLE . PAUL hates them both , but prefers SHUTTLE 'S noisy manlinessWe simply stop doing that  --  dropping things on each other , eating each other alive . SHUTTLE CallingPenelope ! We 're late ! PENELOPE Off , in master bedroom suiteComing . SHUTTLE To PAULWomen are always late . You 'll find out . p. 13 WOODLY ThoughtfullyThe late Mrs. Harold Ryan . SHUTTLE I 'm sick of this argument . I just have one more thing to say : If you elect a President , you support him , no matter what he does . That 's the only way you can have a country ! WOODLY It 's the planet that 's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon . SHUTTLE None of my relatives are Chinese Communists . Speak for yourself . WOODLY Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely , moist , nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device . Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHUTTLE You can believe that if you want . I talk to guys like you , and I want to commit suicide . To PAULYou get that weight-lifting set I sent you ? PAUL It came yesterday . I have n't opened it yet . WOODLY Musingly , attempting to find the idea acceptable , even funny , in a wayMaybe it 's suppose to end now . Maybe God would n't have it any other way . p. 14 SHUTTLE To PAULStart with the smallest weights . Every week add a pound or two . WOODLY Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn  --  so he or she can see how it ends . Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth  --  to see how it ends . They 're all on Times Square  --  making change for peepshows . Or recruiting Marines . SHUTTLE To PAULYou ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ? WOODLY He died of a massive rupture . SHUTTLE You think you 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Right ? You do n't hurt yourself if you start out slow . WOODLY You 're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque ? To PAULTake care of your body , yes ! But do n't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes . Do n't become obsessed by your musculature . Any one of these poor , dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be . Their magic was in their muscles . Your magic is in your brains ! PENELOPE enters from the bedroom , dressed for the fight . She wears barbaric jewelry HAROLD gave her years ago , a jaguar-skin coat over her shoulders p. 15 PENELOPE BrightlyGentlemen ! Is this right for a fight ? It 's been so long . SHUTTLE Beautiful ! I 've never seen that coat . PENELOPE Seven jaguars ' skins , I 'm told . Harold shot every one . Shall we go ? WOODLY Sick about the slain jaguarsOh no ! Wear a coat of cotton  --  wear a coat of wool . PENELOPE What ? WOODLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , though , Penelope , do n't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you . SHUTTLE She 's my date tonight . What do you want her to do  --  bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump ? Bugger off ! Ask Paul what he thinks . To PAULYour mother looks beautiful  --  right ? PAUL pointedly declines to answerKid ? PAUL walks away from himDoes n't your mother look nice ? He goes to PAUL , wondering what is wrongPaul ? PAUL SmolderinglyI do n't care what she wears. p. 16 SHUTTLE Something 's made you sore . PAUL Do n't worry about it . SHUTTLE You bet I 'll worry about it . I said something wrong ? PAUL Close to angry tearsIt 's my father 's birthday  --  that 's all . Facing everybody , raising his voiceThat 's all . Who cares about that ? SHUTTLE Horrified , raising his hand to swear an oathI had not the slightest inkling . To PENELOPE , feeling betrayedWhy did n't you say so ? PAUL BitterlyShe does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to have fun ! To PENELOPEI hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it . To WOODLYDr . Woodly  --  I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you 've said so far . SHUTTLE Reaching out for PAULKid  --  kid  --  PAUL To SHUTTLEAnd I wish you 'd quit touching me all the time . It drives me nuts ! p. 17 SHUTTLE Reaching out again What 's this ? PAUL RecoilingDo n't ! SHUTTLE AghastYou sure misunderstood something  --  and we 'd better get it straight . PAUL Explain it to them . I 'm bugging out of here . He grabs a jacket from a chair . SHUTTLE is in his wayDo n't touch me . Get out of the way . SHUTTLE Men can touch other men , and it does n't mean a thing . Have n't you ever seen football players after they 've won the Superbowl ? PENELOPE To PAULWhere will you be ? PAUL Anywhere but here . I 'd just sit here and cry about the way my father 's been forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother gave me  --  the one he shot ? It 's the proudest thing in my apartment . PAUL At the doorEverybody talks about how rotten kids act . Grownups can be pretty rotten , too . He exits through front door , slams it p. 18 SHUTTLE HeartbrokenKid  --  kid  --  WOODLY It 's good . Let him go . SHUTTLE If he 'd just come out for the Little League , the way I asked him , he 'd find out we touch all the time  --  shove each other , slug each other , and just horse around . I 'm going to go get him  --  WOODLY Do n't ! Let him have all the privacy he wants . Let him grieve , let him rage . There has never been a funeral for his father . PENELOPE I never knew when to hold it  --  or who to ask , or what to say . WOODLY Tonight 's the night . SHUTTLE If he 'd just get into scouting , and camp out some , and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire  --  WOODLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rites of passage . SHUTTLE I feel like I 've been double-crossed . To PENELOPE , peevishlyIf you 'd just told me it was Harold 's birthday  --  PENELOPE What then ? SHUTTLE We could have had some kind of birthday party for him . We could have taken Paul to the fight with us. p. 19 WOODLY Minors are n't allowed at fights . SHUTTLE Then we 'd stay home and eat venison or something , and look through the scrapbooks . I 've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat . Going to the front door I 'm going to bring that boy back . He exits through front door WOODLY Going to PENELOPEThis is very good for us . PENELOPE It is ? WOODLY The wilder Paul is tonight , the calmer he 'll be tomorrow . PENELOPE As long as he keeps out of the park . WOODLY After this explosion , I think , he 'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again . PENELOPE The only thing I ever told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park after the sun goes down . " WOODLY We 've got to dump Shuttle . Pointing to the vacuum cleanerHe brings his vacuum cleaner on dates ? PENELOPE That 's the XKE . WOODLY The what ? p. 20 PENELOPE It 's an experimental model . He does n't dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition . WOODLY What kind of a life is that ? PENELOPE He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old . Clinging to him suddenlyOh , Norbert  --  promise me that Paul has not gone into the park ! WOODLY PauseIf you warned him against it as much as you say , it 's almost a certainty . PENELOPE PetrifiedNo ! Oh no ! Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! The police wo n't even go in there any more . WOODLY I wish Paul luck . PENELOPE It 's suicide ! WOODLY I 'd be dead by now if that were the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past two years , I 've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight . PENELOPE Why would you do that ? WOODLY To show myself how brave I am . The issue 's in doubt , you know  --  since I 'm always for peace  --  p. 21 PENELOPE I 'm amazed . WOODLY Me , too . I know something not even the police know  --  what 's in the park at midnight . Nothing . Or , when I 'm in there , there 's me in there . Fear and nobody and me . PENELOPE And maybe Paul . What about the murderers ? They 're in there ! WOODLY They did n't murder me . PENELOPE Paul 's only twelve years old . WOODLY He can make the sound of human footsteps  --  which is a terrifying sound . PENELOPE We 've got to rescue him . WOODLY If he is in the park , luck is all that can save him now , and there 's plenty of that . PENELOPE He 's not your son . WOODLY No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , I can say to him , " You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . " PauseOn that we can build . PENELOPE It 's a jungle out there . WOODLY That 's been said before . PENELOPE He 'd go to a movie . I think that 's what he 'd do . If I were sure he was in a movie , I could stop worrying . We could have him paged . Lion doorbell roars p. 22 WOODLY I hate that thing . He opens door , admits SHUTTLE , who carries a bakery box PENELOPE Did you see him ? SHUTTLE Yeah . PENELOPE Is he all right ? SHUTTLE Far as I know . PENELOPE Is he coming home ? SHUTTLE He ditched me . He started running , and I started running , then he lost me in the park . PENELOPE The park ! SHUTTLE It 's dark in there . PENELOPE And that 's where he is ! SHUTTLE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PENELOPE Disgusted with him You figure ! SHUTTLE Then I saw this bakery store that was still open , so I bought a birthday cake . PENELOPE A what ? SHUTTLE For Harold . When Paul comes home , we can have some birthday cake . PENELOPE How nice . SHUTTLE They had this cake somebody else had n't picked up . It says , " Happy Birthday , Somebody Else . " p. 23 WOODLY " Happy Birthday , Wanda June ! " SHUTTLE We can take off the " Wanda June " with a butter knife . PENELOPE Did you talk to Paul ? SHUTTLE Before he started to run . He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck  --  and somebody we 'd all hear the sound of that key in the door . PENELOPE We 've got to find him . Preparing to exit through front door I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last . To WOODLYAnd you stay here , Norbert , in case he comes home . To SHUTTLEThat 's all he said  --  the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't very nice . PENELOPE What was it ? SHUTTLE He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon .

The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the time  --  and drink beer .

As always , he is friendly and embarrassed LOOSELEAF When Penelope asked me to say something about dropping the bomb on Nagasaki , I did n't give a very good answer , I guess . It 's a very complicated question . Jesus  --  you know ? You have to explain what it 's like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your orders and all that . What it feels like to be in a plane , what the world looks like down there . After I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me if I would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement . So I did . They met on Thursday nights . I used to belong to that troop . I never made Eagle Scout . But you know something ? It 's a very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout . They always seem so lonesome , like they 'd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about . They get a whole bunch of merit badges . That 's how you get to be an Eagle Scout . I do n't think I had over five or six merit badges . The only one I remember is Public Health . That was a bitch . The Boy Scout Manual said I was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage . Jesus , they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek . He laughs idioticallySugar Creek ! That was a long time ago , but it 's all coming back to me now . There was another merit badge you could get for roller skating . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar Creek , up above where the sewage went in . I got in a fight there one time . I had on roller skates , and the guy I was fighting had on basketball shoes . He had a tremendous advantage over me . He was a little guy , but he beat the shit out of me . I had to laugh like hell . Do n't ever fight a guy when you 've got on roller skates . SilenceJesus  --  I remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before I swallowed  --  so I would n't get sick .

At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village . The name of the village was Mhravitch . Remember that name ! p. 47 PAUL Mhravitch . HAROLD We came up behind a sentry , and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound . PAUL InvoluntarilyUck . HAROLD Do n't care for cold steel ? A knife is worse than a bullet ? PAUL I do n't know . HAROLD The story gets hairier . Should I stop ? PAUL Go on . HAROLD We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane . Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire . Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire . That 's nicer than a knife , is n't it  --  as long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns a curious shade of avocado . I must ask the doctor why that is . At any rate , we stole into the back of the inn , and , with the permission of the management , we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there . PAUL Where did you get the poison ? HAROLD We carried cyanide capsules . We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured . It was your father 's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time . p. 48 PAUL And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia ? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs , and he came running downstairs , for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments  --  editorializing about the hospitality they had received .

They used to call me " The Beast of Yugoslavia , " on account of all the people I had tortured and shot  --  and hanged . We 'd bop ' em on the head . We 'd hook ' em up to the electricity . We 'd stick ' em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff . One time we killed a guy with orange juice . There was a train wreck , and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges , so we had oceans of orange juice . It was a joke  --  how much orange juice we had . And we were interrogating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next thing I know  --  somebody 's filling up this big syringe with orange juice . PauseThere was a guerrilla war going on . You could n't tell who was a guerrilla and who was n't . Even if you got one , it was still a civilian you got . Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is like  --  that 's coals to Newcastle . How do you like that for idiomatic English ? " Coals to Newcastle . " He laughsThat Harold Ryan  --  he says he spoke to me in perfect German ? He talks German like my ass chews gum . I 'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me . I sure did n't understand it the first time around . I figured he was a Lithuanian or something , which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be . All I knew was he was very proud about something , and he had a machine pistol , and it was aimed at me . The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all had guns . They were always looking for revenge . You find a way to bottle revenge  --  that 's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola . PauseHarold Ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys . I killed a hundred times that many , I bet . That 's still peanuts , of course , compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did . Harold and me  --  we was doing it the hard way . I hope the record books will show that . There should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way . PauseI 'm up in Heaven now , like that little Wanda June kid . I was n't hit by no ice-cream truck . Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands . He was good . My eyes popped out . My tongue stuck out like a red banana . I shit in my pants . It was a mess . PauseWhen I got up on the day I died , I said , " What a beautiful day this is . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet was beautiful . Up here I meet guys from other planets . He laughsWe got some really crazy-looking guys up here . Their planets were n't anywhere near as nice as Earth . They had clouds all the time . They never saw a clear blue sky . They never saw snow . They never saw an ocean . They had some little lakes , but you could n't go swimming in them . The lakes was acid . You go swimming , you dissolve . We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes . They dissolved . PauseHarold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia . He switched to English , so I finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about . He wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice . I do n't know how he ever found out about it . There was just three of us there when we did it  --  me and two regular military doctors . Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed . If I 'd lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes and all that , I 'd have to tell the court , I guess , " I was only following orders , as a good soldier should .

It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia . Mhravitch . PAUL When I grow up , I 'm going to go to Mhravitch . HAROLD It 's rather a disappointment these days . It is n't there any more . PAUL Sir ? HAROLD The Germans shot everybody who lived there , then leveled it , plowed it , planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground . They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia . To their twisted way of thinking , your father had butchered an Eagle Scout . AbruptlyPlays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for football , but Mom was afraid I 'd get hurt . HAROLD You 're supposed to get hurt !

WOODLY Moving toward the front doorThanks . HAROLD laughs . This stings WOODLY to a cold , peace-loving angerI 'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health . HAROLD What for ? WOODLY Quarantine , possibly . You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without . Goodbye . He exits instantly p. 70 HAROLD Now that 's what I call fun .

That 's why you 're so tense ! Forget Norbert . Relax . It 's body time . PENELOPE I have a brain . HAROLD We all do . But now it 's body time . Relax . Ideally , the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream . You feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your muscles one by one . Let them go slack . Relax .

PAUL Entering , dressed to go out and playDad  --  HAROLD Hanging on to PENELOPE , but knowing the mood has been brokenCould n't you have vanished quietly out the back door ? PAUL A hundred dollars for breakfast ? HAROLD Leave a tip . PENELOPE Suddenly twisting away , having been nearly hypnotizedI have some change . HAROLD Ram it up your ass ! He realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer . PENELOPE and PAUL are straight as ramrodsI do beg your pardon . SincerelyThose words were illy chosen . There is tension in all of us here . Something you must both understand , however , is that the head of this household is home , and he is Harold Ryan , and people do what he says when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock is constructed . Lion doorbell roarsSometimes even I hate that thing . PAUL goes reeling to the door in terror , admits LOOSELEAF , who has also been sleeping in his clothes p. 73 LOOSELEAF Walking right inI 've been looking at motorcycles . HAROLD Go home !

HAROLD And how were things ? LOOSELEAF Let 's talk about something else . PENELOPE To HAROLDAlice got married again . LOOSELEAF She did ? PENELOPE You did n't even find that out ? LOOSELEAF There was so much going on . PENELOPE She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum. p. 74 LOOSELEAF So that 's it ! " Kestenbaum , Kestenbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought it was some foreign language . HAROLD Otherwise , how are things ? LOOSELEAF I sure did n't expect her to drop dead . PENELOPE Dead !

PENELOPE ShrillyWho 's dead ? LOOSELEAF My mother-in-law . Fire engines , pulmotors , doctors , cops , coroners  --  PENELOPE What happened ? LOOSELEAF Well  --  I walked up to the front door . I was still alive . Big surprise . I rang the doorbell , and old Mrs. Wheeler answered . She had her Goddamn knitting . I said , " Guess who ? " She conked right out . PENELOPE How horrible . p. 75 LOOSELEAF Yeah  --  cripes . I never did get any sense out of Alice . She found me holding up the old lady , dead as a mackerel . It was a bitch . You know  --  maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been the paper boy . Maybe not . I du n no , boy . That 's civilian life for you . Who knows what kills anybody ?

" HAROLD She 's up in Heaven now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure happiness . There 's nothing nicer than that . Suddenly , angrily , slamming a table with his fistChow ! Harold Ryan wants chow ! PENELOPE What a honeymoon . HAROLD Honeymoon temporarily canceled . Catching sight of PAUL , whose physical appearance really offends himThe boy should still go out and exercise . I have the impression he never gets any exercise . He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators . PENELOPE You 're wrong . HAROLD Then let me see him go out and get some exercise . ExplosivelyRight now ! PAUL goes reeling in terror to the front door , opens it PAUL To HAROLD , abjectlyWhat kind of exercise ? p. 77 HAROLD Beat the shit out of someone who hates you . PAUL exits .

PENELOPE nodsThen we have a cook . PENELOPE hesitatesCook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . PENELOPE People do n't use that word any more . HAROLD Do n't lecture me on race relations . I do n't have a molecule of prejudice . I 've been in battle with every kind of man there is . I 've been in bed with every kind of woman there is  --  from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian . If I 'd ever been to the South Pole , there 'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me . Cook ! PENELOPE You leave me so  --  so without  --  without dignity . HAROLD People now have dignity when frying eggs ? PENELOPE They do n't have to feel like slaves . HAROLD GrandlyThen go now  --  and fry with dignity  --  sunnyside up . PENELOPE attempts to respond to this , but is too enraged . She exits , making a tiny mosquito-like hum p. 78 LOOSELEAF I du n no , boy . HAROLD The educational process . LOOSELEAF I guess . You 're lucky you do n't have any old people around here . HAROLD She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bedroom last night . LOOSELEAF starts to laugh . HAROLD shuts him upWhat 's funny about that ? LOOSELEAF ApologeticallyYou know me , boy . PENELOPE enters from the kitchen with a question on her lips HAROLD I should have torn that door off its hinges . Should have scrogged her ears off . Should have broken the bed . Seeing PENELOPEWhat do you want ? Words fail herWell ? PENELOPE I  --  I was wondering  --  is there anything you should n't eat  --  because of jungle fever ? HAROLD I could eat a raw baby crocodile . Turning to LOOSELEAF crasslyThe way to get your wife back is in bed . Do such a job on her that she 'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours . To PENELOPEWe 're starving . Do you mind ? PENELOPE exits dumbly , detesting the word " scrog , " which she has never heard beforeShe had two lovers , by the way . LOOSELEAF starts to laugh again , stops the laugh as HAROLD glowers p. 79 LOOSELEAF Excuse me . HAROLD One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peacefulness  --  maudlin concern . LOOSELEAF Huh . HAROLD He and his love are like a retiarius . Do you know what a retiarius is ? LOOSELEAF He 's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and does n't wear anything but a jockstrap . HAROLD AmazedHow do you know that ? LOOSELEAF You told me . HAROLD When ? LOOSELEAF When we were up in the tree so long  --  with the bats . HAROLD Oh . I 'd forgotten . LOOSELEAF Fourteen times you told me . I counted . HAROLD Really ? LOOSELEAF You 'd get this funny look in your eyes , and I 'd say to myself , " Oh , Jesus  --  he 's going to tell me what a retiarius is again . " HAROLD Acknowledging a flaw in a manly waySorry . PENELOPE enters , is about to speak . HAROLD stops her with a raised fingerLet me guess  --  breakfast is served ? p. 80 PENELOPE No . HAROLD What then ? PENELOPE I do not wish to be scrogged  --  ever . I never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me . HAROLD That 's what you 're supposed to say . PENELOPE This is not a coy deception . I do not want to be scrogged . I want love . I want tenderness . HAROLD You do n't know you want . That 's the way God built you ! PENELOPE I will not be scrogged . I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers , and you promised me that the fish could n't feel . HAROLD It could n't ! PENELOPE I 'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish  --  along with yours . HAROLD Shaking his headFish ca n't feel . PENELOPE Well , I can . Some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . I 'm not a silly carhop any more . An unexpected , minor insightMaybe you 're right about fish . When I was a carhop , I did n't feel much more than a fish would . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solid information . I know a lot more now  --  and a lot of it has to do with you . p. 81 HAROLD Sensing dangerSuch as ? PENELOPE The whole concept of heroism  --  and its sexual roots . HAROLD Tell me about its sexual roots . PENELOPE It 's complicated and I do n't want to go into it now , because it 's bound to sound insulting  --  even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted . It 's just the truth . HAROLD I like the truth . I would n't be alive today if I were n't one of the biggest fans truth ever had . PENELOPE Well  --  part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long , and make awful messes while they 're there . HAROLD Go on . PENELOPE BlurtingAnd they have very mixed feelings about women . They hate them in a way . One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently . They can scrog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You learned this in some college course ? PENELOPE I learned a lot of things in college . Actually  --  it was Norbert who told me that . p. 82 HAROLD DarklyThe doctor . PENELOPE Yes . HAROLD And what is his most cherished possession ? PENELOPE Not sensing the drift of the conversationHis most cherished possession ? His violin , I guess . HAROLD And he keeps it in his apartment ? PENELOPE Still at seaYes . HAROLD And no one 's there now ? PENELOPE I do n't think so . HAROLD That 's too bad . I would rather have him at home  --  to see what I 'm going to do . PENELOPE Suddenly catching on , sick with fearWhat are you going to do ? HAROLD He did his best to destroy my most precious possession , which is the high opinion women have of me . I 'm now going to even that score . I 'm going to break in his door and I 'm going to smash his violin . PENELOPE No you 're not ! HAROLD Why not ?

VON KONIGSWALD Mozart plays shuffleboard . WANDA JUNE Lewis Carroll , who wrote Alice in Wonderland , plays shuffleboard . VON KONIGSWALD Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard . WANDA JUNE Walt Disney , who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , plays shuffleboard . Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard . VON KONIGSWALD It was almost worth the trip  --  to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy , playing shuffleboard . I like his sense of humor , though  --  you know ? He 's got a blue-and-gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back ? " Pontius Pilate Athletic Club . " Most people do n't get it .

With a yellow streak up the back . BOTH laughWe got very good tailor shops up here . They 'll make you any kind of uniform , any kind of sweatsuit you want . Judas Iscariot  --  he 's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart . He walks around all hunched over , and he never looks anybody in the eye , and written on the back of his jacket are the words , " Go take a flying  --  WANDA JUNE punches him in the ribsleap at the moon .

Who 's the little girl ? p. 85 WANDA JUNE Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake . I do n't really know him . MILDRED Thought you were another wife , maybe . WANDA JUNE I 'm only ten years old . MILDRED That 's what he wanted  --  a ten-year-old wife . He 'd come home from a war or a safari , and he 'd wind up talking to the little kids . WANDA JUNE Wo n't you please join our club ? Please ? MILDRED Honey  --  Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I 've got  --  and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget . He drove me to drink . He drove his first two wives to drink . VON KONIGSWALD Because he was cruel ? MILDRED Covering WANDA JUNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation . Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring . He would kick the furniture with his boots , spit into corners and the fireplace . He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them . He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him , and he 'd tear off my clothes . He would carry me into the bedroom , telling me to scream and kick my feet . That was very important to him . I did it . I tried to be a good wife . He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo . I could n't do that , but I pretended I did . It was all over  --  ten seconds after he 'd said the word " buffalo . " Then he 'd zip up his pants , and go outside , and tell true war stories to the little kids . Any little kids . p. 86 VON KONIGSWALD That is sad . MILDRED BlanklyIs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and break things . VON KONIGSWALD Ja ? MILDRED Never mind . It 's a dumb theory .

I ca n't wear a uniform anymore . HAROLD Wear your uniform and every decoration , and let them despise you , if they dare . LOOSELEAF Alice would be absolutely tear-ass .

PauseYou know what happened in Heaven today ? There was a tornado . I 'm not kidding you  --  there was a Goddamn tornado . Tore up fifty-six houses , a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel . Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole . Nobody got killed . Nobody ever gets killed . They just bounce around a lot . Then they get up  --  and start playing shuffleboard again . PauseI never saw a tornado when I was alive , and I grew up in Oklahoma . There 's this big , black , funnel-shaped cloud . Sounds like a railroad train without the whistle . I had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that . A lot of people got photographs . PauseAfter the tornado was over , a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me  --  to use up the roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of everything .

LOOSELEAF wears an ill-fitting uniform , which he has rented p. 90 LOOSELEAF I told you the uniform would n't help . HAROLD It helped more than you know . Down deep , people were deeply affected . LOOSELEAF You keep on saying " deep " and " deeply . " I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime . SHUTTLE I ca n't get over how you guys and my friends . Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends . HAROLD Our pleasure . SHUTTLE Eight years you guys were together  --  through thick and thin . HAROLD For seven and a half of those years we were heavily dragged  --  or we would have been home long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Lupi-Loopo Indians , who fed us a strange blue soup . SHUTTLE Blue soup . HAROLD It sapped our will  --  made us peaceful and unenterprising . It was a form of chemical castration . We became two more sleepy Indians .

HAROLD We 've got to do something to make this boy 's voice change . I wonder if we could n't get bull balls somewhere , and fry ' em up . To PAULStill miss your mother ? PAUL WeaklyNo . HAROLD You 're free to go to her , if you want . If you 'd rather be a woman and run with the women , just say the word . SHUTTLE Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die ? HAROLD I 'd rather go to Viet Nam . SHUTTLE Would somebody please pass me the catsup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking catsup . " SHUTTLE Pass the fucking catsup . LOOSELEAF gives it to him .

LOOSELEAF I du n no . HAROLD You 're so low ! Look at that beautiful red meat . You have n't touched it . p. 92 LOOSELEAF Sorry . AT least you 've got a place to come back to . I do n't have a place to come back to anymore . HAROLD All the more reason to go to Africa . LOOSELEAF I du n no . You know . PauseI used to really love that Alice . Do you know that ?

SHUTTLE I 'd think any woman worth her salt would be proud to be married to a test pilot . I know I would . LOOSELEAF She tried to like it . She was a very nervous woman . SHUTTLE I could tell that at the funeral . To PAULWould you please pass the fucking catsup again ? Was it dangerous testing planes ? LOOSELEAF I du n no . Who knows ? You know  --  you 're up there , and you 're in some plane nobody ever flew before . You put her into a dive , and everything starts screaming and shaking , and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face . You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess , and then you pull back on the controls , and you black out for a couple of seconds . When you come to , everything 's usually fairly okay  --  except maybe you threw up all over yourself . It 's just another job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance !

HAROLD Get used to it . To PAULBack door , Paul . PAUL exits to the kitchen . To SHUTTLEIt 's possible , of course , that you 'll die in Africa . SHUTTLE I 've considered that . HAROLD Selling vacuum cleaners is n't the best preparation you could have . SHUTTLE I just want one true adventure before I die . HAROLD That can be arranged . PAUL appears at the mouth of the doorway . He has something amazing to announce PAUL Dad ? HAROLD Who was it ? PAUL It 's Mom . He steps aside . PENELOPE appears . HAROLD and SHUTTLE stand , HAROLD angrily p. 94 LOOSELEAF Openly , cheerfullyHi , Penelope . HAROLD To LOOSELEAFShut up , you ninny ! To PENELOPEYou were never to come here again  --  for any reason whatsoever ! PENELOPE I came for my clothes . HAROLD Sneaking in the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for a servile , worthless organism to use . HAROLD Your clothes are at the city dump by now . Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation . PENELOPE I came for Paul as well . HAROLD If he wants to go . PENELOPE You took him to the funeral , I hear . HAROLD He 'd never seen a corpse . He 's seen a dozen now . PENELOPE A dozen ? HAROLD It 's a big and busy funeral home . PENELOPE To PAULDid you like it , dear ? HAROLD It is n't a matter of liking . It 's a matter of getting used to death  --  as a perfectly natural thing . Would you mind leaving ? No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan , and then comes back  --  for anything . p. 95 PENELOPE Unless she has nerve . HAROLD More nerve than the doctor , I must admit . He has n't been home for two days . Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television  --  and the violin ? PENELOPE He knows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his reaction . The thrill of smashing something is n't in the smashing , but in the owner 's reactions . PENELOPE He cried . HAROLD About a broomstick and a cigar box  --  and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat . PENELOPE Two hundred years old . HAROLD He feels awful loss  --  which was precisely my intention . PENELOPE Moving toward the violin , and , incidentally , placing herself much closer to SHUTTLEHe had hoped that someone would be playing it still  --  two hundred years from now . HAROLD Echoing , expressing the futility of such long-term expectationsHope . He spots the vacuum cleaner , probes it with his toe , asks SHUTTLE with seriousnessDo you hope with all your heart that someone will be using this vacuum cleaner two hundred years from now ? SHUTTLE starts to answer , but stops , supposing that he is being made sport ofFifty years ? p. 96 SHUTTLE You 're making a joke . HAROLD Not jokingI 'm interested in long-term expectations . SHUTTLE Flatly , protecting his dignityIt 's engineered to last about fifteen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you silly people and your things . Things , things , things . PENELOPE To SHUTTLE , as HAROLD reflects majestically on the emptiness of materialismYou and Harold are friends ? SHUTTLE Revealing how mixed and worried his feelings areHe 's the most wonderful guy I ever met , Penelope . He 's the most complicated guy I ever met . I ca n't believe it , but he 's going to take me to Africa with him . HAROLD Things . PENELOPE You feel I 've done a dreadful thing  --  leaving him ? SHUTTLE Almost hypnotizedIf I were married to him , I sure would n't walk out . HAROLD Directly to the audienceNever mind the condition of your body and your spirit ! Look after your things , your things ! p. 97 PENELOPE To LOOSELEAFAnd you , Colonel ? Let me guess : You do n't know . LOOSELEAF I du n no .

We 're too crazy . You know ? HAROLD In what way , pray tell ? LOOSELEAF I did n't like that violin thing . That was sad . HAROLD Tit for tat  --  as simple as that . LOOSELEAF You never played a violin . HAROLD You did ? LOOSELEAF Yeah . I practically forgot . But after you busted that thing , I got to thinking , " Jesus  --  maybe I 'll start the violin again . " That was a mean , childish thing  --  busting that violin . That did n't just belong to Woodly . That belonged to everybody . Maybe he would have sold it to me , and I could have some fun . Then I could sell it to somebody else , and he could have some fun . After you busted the violin , boy , and Penelope walked out , I thought to myself , " Jesus  --  who could blame her ? " p. 98 HAROLD Maybe it 's time you got out . LOOSELEAF Me ? HAROLD You . LOOSELEAF Okay . PauseOkay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that . HAROLD Everybody thinks that . LOOSELEAF Anybody who 'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb . HAROLD The one direct , decisive , intelligent act of your life ! LOOSELEAF Shaking his headI do n't think so . PauseIt could have been . HAROLD If what ? LOOSELEAF If I had n't done it . If I 'd said to myself , " Screw it . I 'm going to let all those people down there live . " HAROLD They were enemies . We were at war . LOOSELEAF Yeah , Jesus  --  but wars would be a lot better , I think , if guys would say to themselves sometimes , " Jesus  --  I 'm not going to do that to the enemy . That 's too much . " You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there , even though you do n't know how to make a violin , just by not busting it up . I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki , and the mother , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em to Heaven instead  --  and I do n't think there is one . p. 99 HAROLD Goodbye , Looseleaf .

HAROLD Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman ? SHUTTLE You invited me . HAROLD To make an ass of yourself . SHUTTLE What went wrong ? HAROLD We 're ahead of schedule , that 's all . You 're finding out here what you would have found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be eaten alive . p. 100 SHUTTLE Gee whiz  --  HAROLD It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us . SHUTTLE I would n't drop my gun . HAROLD You 're hollow , like a woman . SHUTTLE I 'm smarter than Looseleaf . HAROLD He can shoot ! He can hold his ground ! He can attack ! You 're in your proper profession right now  --  sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives , closet drunkards every one . SHUTTLE Close to tearsHow do you know how I 'd act in Africa ? HAROLD Look how you 're acting now ! This is a moment of truth , and you 're almost crying . Slug me ! SHUTTLE You 're my buddy . HAROLD Out ! Out ! SHUTTLE No matter what you say to me , I still think you 're the greatest guy I ever knew . HAROLD Out ! SHUTTLE You  --  you are n't going to have any friends left , if you do n't watch out . HAROLD Thank God ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces PENELOPE and PAUL , speaks with malicious calmWell  --  what have we here ? A family . p. 101 PENELOPE Almost a Christmas scene . HAROLD Goodbye , goodbye , goodbye . PENELOPE Just one favor . HAROLD Money ? There 's plenty of that . Mildred got the brewery . You 'll probably get the baseball team . PENELOPE I want you to tell me that you loved me once . HAROLD is about to dismiss this request majestically , but PENELOPE cuts him off with a sharp , dangerous warningI mean it ! I must have that , and so must Paul . Tell him that he was conceived in love , even though you hate me now . Tell both of us that somewhere in our lives was love . HAROLD experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds , obviously saying them to himself , directing himself with his hands . Nothing quite satisfies him HAROLD Testimonials of that sort are  --  are beyond my range . I do n't do them well . Sincerely , not liking to fail in any areaThat 's a failing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care . I do n't care if there was love or not . That 's all right . I 'm going to go to my room and close the door . I do n't want to hear any more . PAUL exits wretchedly to his room p. 102 HAROLD See how you 've upset him . He was so merry and hale before you came home . PENELOPE How unhappy he 's going to be  --  alone in his room . HAROLD He 'll play with his rifle , I expect . That will cheer him up . PENELOPE Rifle ? HAROLD I bought him a twenty-two yesterday  --  on the way home from Hamburger Heaven . And where is the good doctor ? Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere ? PENELOPE He 's in East St. Louis with his mother  --  visiting an aunt . HAROLD Last I heard , his mother was going alone . PENELOPE He 's afraid of you , Harold . He knew you 'd want to fight him . He does n't know anything about fighting . He hates pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not detest him for his cowardice ? PENELOPE It seems highly intelligent to me . HAROLD What kind of a country has this become ? The men wear beads and refuse to fight  --  and the women adore them . America 's days of greatness are over . It has drunk the blue soup . PENELOPE Blue soup ? p. 103 HAROLD An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink . It put us in a haze  --  a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge . We laughed , we sang , we snoozed . When a bird called , we answered back . Every living thing was our brother or our sister , we thought . Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long , and we cried . We had a funeral that went on for five days  --  for the cockroach ! I sang " Oh Promise Me . " Can you imagine ? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to " Oh Promise Me " ? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more blue soup ! Never stopped drinking blue soup . Blue soup all the time . We 'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze , and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender . PENELOPE Sounds quite beautiful . HAROLD AngeredBeautiful , you say ? It was n't life , it was n't death  --  it was n't anything ! Anger still mountingBeautiful ? Seven years gone  --  Snapping his fingerslike that , like that ! Seven years of silliness and random dreams ! Seven years of nothingness , when there could have been so much ! PENELOPE Like what ? p. 104 HAROLD Becoming dangerously physical , seizing a battle-axAction ! Interaction ! Give and take ! Challenge and response ! He splits a coffee table with the ax PAUL Rushing in with his .22 rifle at a high port armsMom ? HAROLD What 's this ? PAUL wilts instantly , attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous , harmless , meaninglessWhat 's this ? PAUL Nothing . HAROLD That 's a rifle you have ? PAUL No . HAROLD Of course it is . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL obeys . A cartridge pops outThat 's a cartridge , if I 'm not mistaken . Gunpowder , bullet , cartridge case , and fulminate of mercury percussion cap  --  all set to go . PAUL I was cleaning it . HAROLD Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber  --  where it belongs . PAUL Gee whiz , Dad  --  p. 105 HAROLD Welcome to manhood , you little sparrowfart ! Load that gun ! PAUL BleatinglyDad  --  HAROLD Too late ! It 's man to man now . Protecting your mother from me , are you ? Protect her ! PENELOPE He 's a child ! HAROLD With an iron penis three feet long . Load it , boy . PENELOPE You 're begging him to kill you ? HAROLD If he thinks he 's man enough . PENELOPE Amazed by sudden insightThat 's really what you want . You become furious when people wo n't make you dead . HAROLD I 'm teaching my son to be a man . PENELOPE So he can kill you . You hate your own life that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAROLD I plan to live one hundred years ! PENELOPE No you do n't . HAROLD If that 's the case  --  what 's to prevent my killing myself ? PENELOPE Honor , I suppose . HAROLD What a handsome word . p. 106 PENELOPE WonderinglyBut it 's all balled up in your head with death . The highest honor is death . When you talk of these animals , one by one , you do n't just talk of killing them . You honored them with death . Harold  --  it is not honor to be killed . HAROLD If you 've lived a good life , fought well  --  PENELOPE It 's still just death , the absence of life  --  no honor at all . It 's worse than the blue soup by far  --  that nothingness . To you , though , it 's the honor that crowns them all . HAROLD May I continue with the rearing of my son ? To PAULLoad that gun ! PAUL shakes his headLoad it ! PAUL refusesThen speak , by God ! Can you fight with words ? PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad ! Tell me you do n't like the way I treat your mother ! Tell me you wish I 'd never come home ! PAUL WeaklyIt 's your house , Dad . HAROLD Throwing up his handsEverybody simply evaporates ! Including the audience , inviting it to share his indignationThere are great issues to be fought out here  --  or to be argued , at least . The enemy , the champion of all who oppose me , is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt ! I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin . p. 107 PENELOPE The old heroes are going to have to get used to this , Harold  --  the new heroes who refuse to fight . They 're trying to save the planet . There 's no time for battle , no point to battle anymore . HAROLD I feel mocked , insulted , with no sort of satisfaction in prospect . We do n't have to fight with steel . I can fight with words . I 'm not an inarticulate ape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocabulary . Call him up in East St. Louis , Penelope . Tell him to come here . PENELOPE No . HAROLD Emptily , turning awayNo . Pause . He contemplates PAULAnd my son , the only son of Harold Ryan  --  he 's going to grow up to be a vanisher , too ? PENELOPE I do n't know . I hope he never hunts . I hope he never kills another human being . HAROLD To PAUL , quietlyYou hope this , too ? PAUL I do n't know what I hope . But I do n't think you care what I hope , anyway . You do n't know me . Indicating PENELOPEYou do n't know her , either . I do n't think you know anybody . You talk to everybody just the same . p. 108 HAROLD I 'm talking to you gently now . PAUL Yeah . But it 's going to get loud again . PENELOPE He 's right , Harold . To you , we 're simply pieces in a game  --  this one labeled " woman , " that one labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy " and you are confused . Lion doorbell rings . PAUL goes to answer it HAROLD There wo n't be anybody out there . That 's the new style : nobody anywhere . PAUL , aghast , admits NORBERT WOODLY . WOODLY is high as a kite on his own adrenalin PENELOPE Aghast , chokinglyGet out of here . WOODLY It 's really that bad ? He comes farther into the room , bravely PENELOPE You fool , you fool . WOODLY Oh  --  look at the poor , crucified violin , would you ? HAROLD It died for your sins . WOODLY This little corpse is intended as a lesson ? HAROLD There 's a certain amount of information there . WOODLY Lest we forget how cruel you are . p. 109 PENELOPE Moving to the telephoneI 'm going to call the police . HAROLD FrighteninglyDo n't ! WOODLY I agree . Closes door . PENELOPE backs away from the phone , drifts toward PAUL , who still holds his rifle HAROLD This is man to man . WOODLY It 's healer to killer . Is that the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same hairy , humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon . " Honor , " if you like . HAROLD To PENELOPEHe 's a champion after all . WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction  --  when all we can learn from them is this : how cruel you are . PENELOPE This is suicide . To PAULGo get the police . HAROLD Stop ! PAUL stopsThere 's going to be no bloodshed here . I know how he 'll fight  --  the only way he can fight : with words . The truth . To WOODLYAm I correct ? p. 110 WOODLY Yes . HAROLD I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words . The truth ! Correct ? WOODLY Correct . HAROLD What an hallucination ! He laughsOh , dear , dear , dear , dear . Oh dearie me . WOODLY You have n't heard me yet . HAROLD You intend to crack my eardrums with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who will clean up this awful mess ? WOODLY We 'll find out now , wo n't we ? PENELOPE No , we wo n't . No matter how it begins , it will end in death . Because it always does . Is n't that always how it ends , Harold  --  in death ? HAROLD There has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamor of some sort , sport of some sort . These elements are lacking . WOODLY You 're a filthy , rotten bastard . HAROLD Pretending to be woundedOooooo . That hurt . WOODLY You 're old  --  so old . p. 111 HAROLD Now who 's being cruel ? WOODLY A living fossil ! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs . HAROLD We do survive , do n't we ? You 're going to have to apologize , of course , for calling me a bastard . That 's a matter of form  --  not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard . No rush about that . Just remember to apologize sometime soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a bitch . HAROLD Yes  --  well  --  uh  --  that 's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology . Whenever you feel like it . It 's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that 's ringing loudly . Your apology turns off the alarm . PENELOPE Leveling the gunI 'm turning off the alarm . I 'm turning off everything . HAROLD Ah ! The lady is armed . PENELOPE I want you to get out of here , Norbert . Harold  --  I want you to sit down in the chair , and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone . HAROLD To WOODLYWhoever has the gun , you see , gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do . It 's the American way . p. 112 PENELOPE I mean it ! HAROLD Then you 'd better fix you bayonet , because there are n't any bullets in the gun . PENELOPE To PAULWhere 's the bullet ? PAUL makes no move to help HAROLD Help your mother find the bullet . PENELOPE To PAUL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . PAUL obeysHow do I load ? HAROLD To PAULLoad it for her . PAUL shakily obeysCock it , too . PAUL obeysGive it to her . PAUL obeys PENELOPE All right ! Am I exceedingly dangerous now ? HAROLD The National Safety Council would be appalled . PENELOPE Then listen to me . AngrilyYou 're both disgusting  --  with your pride , your pride . To WOODLYI hate you for coming here  --  like a federal marshal in a western film . I loved you when you stayed away . But here you are now  --  high noon in the Superbowl ! You fool , you fool . p. 113 WOODLY Everything 's going to be beautiful . PENELOPE You fake ! You 're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon . PauseYou 're not going to beat Harold . You 're not going to beat anybody . You 're not going to stay here , either  --  yammering and taunting until you 're most gloriously killed . Go home ! HAROLD She 's right , Norbert  --  go home . WOODLY I have n't said all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't told you , Harold , how comical I think you are . HAROLD Hit squarely , absolutely unable to forgiveComical ? PENELOPE To HAROLDSit down or I 'll shoot ! HAROLD goes over to her , easily takes the gun away HAROLD Give me that Goddamn thing ! Now get out of here , or I might kill you . Who knows ? PENELOPE TerrifiedYou 've killed women ? HAROLD Seventeen of them  --  eleven by accident . March ! Move ! To PAULYou , too ! PENELOPE and PAUL move toward the front door p. 114 PENELOPE Norbert  --  you come , too . To HAROLDLet him go , Harold . Let him go . HAROLD Of course he can go  --  if he 'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment  --  and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree . PENELOPE Do it , Norbert . WOODLY Hands and knees , you say ? HAROLD And terror , if you do n't mind . PENELOPE Do it ! WOODLY To PENELOPE , simply , decisively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye ! He bellies and bullies PENELOPE and PAUL out the front doorGet the police ! No time to lose ! He slams the door , turns to WOODLYYou 're in one hell of a jam . You realize that ? WOODLY I 'm high as a kite . HAROLD Glands . You 're supposed to be happy when you die . Call me comical again . WOODLY You 're a clown . You 're a clown who kills  --  but you 're a clown . p. 115 HAROLD I love you ! Have a cigar ! WOODLY Ignoring the cigarEvolution has made you a clown  --  with a cigar . Simple butchers like you are obsolete ! HAROLD I 'm to be left behind  --  in primordial ooze ? WOODLY If you 're at home in the ooze , and nowhere else . HAROLD This is going to become very physical . Are you prepared for that ? WOODLY You 're not such a creature of the ooze that you 'd hurt an unarmed man . HAROLD I 'm an honorable clown ? WOODLY King Arthur . HAROLD You hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mercy . HAROLD No quarter asked Taking a swordNo quarter given . WOODLY Do n't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ? HAROLD Offering swordCut me open . Find out . WOODLY I 've struck my blow . p. 116 HAROLD With spittle ? WOODLY I 've poisoned you . HAROLD Pointing at WOODLY in horrorLucretia Borgia ? Looking around franticallySomething I drank or touched ? UnderstandingYou refused a cigar . That 's it ! Potassium cyanide in the humidor ! Treacherous lover of peace ! WOODLY I put a poisoned thought in your head . Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind . It 's saying , " Obsolete , obsolete , obsolete , " and , " Clown , clown , clown . " HAROLD Poison . WOODLY You have a very good mind , or I would n't have come back . That mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , " Is Harold Ryan really a clown ? " And the answer is , " Yes . " HAROLD Touching his forehead experimentallyI  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WOODLY You can never take yourself seriously again ! Look at all the creatures you 've protected us from ! Did you shoot them on the elevator , as they were on their way up here to eat us alive ? p. 117 HAROLD Blankly , as though in a dreamNo . WOODLY The magic root you gave me  --  I had it analyzed . It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893 ! He explored your famous jungle for five years , armed with nothing but kindness , a talent for languages , and a pocketknife . HAROLD BlanklyI see . WOODLY You are n't going to hurt me . You are n't going to hurt anybody any more . Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous  --  to yourself ! HAROLD QuietlyDon Quixote . WOODLY My violin is avenged ! HAROLD Something seems to have happened to my self-respect . WOODLY And the hell with it . It was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed . HAROLD The new hero is you . WOODLY I hate crowds , and I have no charisma  --  HAROLD You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of science and of peace  --  like me . He 'll disarm you , of course . No more guns , no more guns . p. 118 HAROLD Was I ever of use ? WOODLY Never . For when you began to kill for the fun of it , you became the chief source of agony of mankind . HAROLD picks up the rifle , considers it , offers it to WOODLY HAROLD Here . Finish the job . WOODLY I 'm utterly satisfied . HAROLD You 're making a mistake . Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded . You 've wounded me . WOODLY More clowning ! Do n't you see ? HAROLD We never quit fighting until we 're dead . WOODLY You 'd be killing a friend . Do n't you know how much I like you ? HAROLD I 'm going to shoot you now . WOODLY No ! HAROLD My self-respect is gone  --  and my soldier 's honor with it . It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man . WOODLY New dignity can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! HAROLD Like the saber-toothed tiger . WOODLY SickenedOh God  --  you 're really going to kill me. p. 119 HAROLD It wo n't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee . Heaven is very much like Paradise , they say . You 'll like it there . WOODLY Can I beg for mercy  --  on my knees ? HAROLD If you want to be found that way . WOODLY What is this thing that kills me ? HAROLD Man , as man was meant to be  --  a vengeful ape who murders . He will soon be extinct . It 's time , it 's time . WOODLY Do n't shoot . HAROLD I 've enjoyed being man . He aims the rifle tentatively WOODLY No . He goes down on his kneesNo . HAROLD Get up . WOODLY No . HAROLD Have it your way . We 'd both be better off dead now . HAROLD begins to squeeze the trigger , falters , lowers the rifleCa n't do it . WOODLY Thank God . HAROLD Crawl home . He turns his back on WOODLY , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . HAROLD It 's trash now , like mine . WOODLY New lives begin ! HAROLD Somewhere in this city . Not here , not here . Tell Penelope I loved her  --  in my clownish way . And Paul . Tell him to be a healer , by all means . WOODLY What are you going to do ? HAROLD Use the sanitary facilities , if I may . WOODLY Leave the rifle here . HAROLD I 'll put it in Paul 's room , where it belongs . WOODLY Give me your word of honor that that 's all you 're going to do . HAROLD For what it 's worth now , Harold Ryan , the clown , gives his sacred word . HAROLD exits into corridor . WOODLY looks after him helplessly , apprehensively . Silence . WOODLY Harold ? VON KONIGSWALD , MILDRED , and WANDA JUNE enter from the side stealthily . VON KONIGSWALD pantomimes that his companions are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful . All ghosts cup their hands to their ears WOODLY Harold ? There is a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WANDA JUNE is dazed . WOODLY collapses in guilt-stricken grief . HAROLD enters from the corridor , shaking his head p. 121 HAROLD I missed . VON KONIGSWALD expresses disappointment . MILDRED covers her face . WANDA JUNE sucks her thumb
