txt A political campaign organizer , reflecting this week on the prolonged drama of Anthony M. Scotto 's Federal trial on racketeering charges , recalled with fond nostalgia the time not so long ago when cash contributions flowed with uninhibited ease into campaign coffers in New York . Few gave such frequently illegal money a second thought . " There was always cash , always , " reports this political expert , who , for obvious reasons , requested anonymity . " I was in a room once , in a 1965 mayoral campaign , where a guy opened up a briefcase and said , ' What do you need ? ' Packets of Money " One of campaign directors told him $25,000 ? to meet immediate bills . So the guy ? this was a businessman from Queens ? pulls out two packets of bills from his briefcase . There were still five packets left . " That sort of thing always happened and I 'm sure it still does , though there 's less of it . There 's no way you 're ever going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the politically sensitive trial of Mr. Scotto , this is the kind of thing that sympathetic political professionals , many of them Mr. Scotto 's friends , are saying privately . They say that cash contributions were common until the state 's campaign finance laws were tightened in post-Watergate 1974 . And that old habits do not die easily . Mr. Scotto has been charged with receiving $300,000 in illegal cash payoffs from waterfront businessmen . The defense claims Mr. Scotto received only $75,000 and that he gave all of it to Governor Carey 's 1978 re-election bid and Mario M. Cuomo 's 1977 mayoral campaign in New York City . Mr. Cuomo is now Lieutenant Governor . Politicians and campaign experts interviewed declined to comment for the record about Mr. Scotto 's line of defense . State law prohibits political contributions of more than $100 in cash , and it is also a violation to conceal the name of a campaign contributor . But Mr.Scotto is n't charged with election law misdemeanors . The most serious charge in the 60-count indictment against him involves racketeering and carries a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Throwback ' Whatever the outcome of Mr. Scotto 's trial , his defense has served to highlight the contrast between what might be called the old politics and the new ; between stubborn traditions that refuse to bow out gracefully , and the reforms that were supposed to change things but , the political experts say , have n't quite done SO . " I 've never seen it yet , but everybody has always known there 's lots of money on the streets , " says David Garth , the media consultant whose clients have included Mr. Carey and Mayor Koch . " We have always made every effort to stop it . We want to put every dollar into radio and television advertising and phone banks . But there are always street operations , and the ironic part is that it 's old politics . It 's a throwback . I do n't think it accomplishes a damn thing . " Street money in political campaigns is precisely that : money used on the streets , mainly on primary and election days , to help get the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expense money , " explains one former campaign manager who ran major city and statewide campaigns in New York before the new election law went into effect . " It was used to pay off campaign workers , it was used to buy coffee and donuts . Listen , in a big constituency , money goes fast . " A considerable part of that money was cash , and much of it was unrecorded , according to politicians who worked in campaigns before the more restrictive 1974 state law was passed , requiring detailed reporting of all campaign contributions and expenditures . The pre-1974 law required campaigns to report contributions , but there was no limit on the size of contributions and no government agency had any enforcement power . In the absence of strong laws , cash contributions were " endemic to the system , " according to a former campaign strategist . " It was a tradition . The money came in from businessmen who have a cash flow ? people in real estate , the theater business , the restaurant business , labor unions , people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes in the headquarters and most of it went out on election day . Some of it disappeared , too . " The big problem , " he said , " was skimming " ? the practice of stealing cash . This occurred , he said , " particularly on Election Day . " Asked if he thought unrecorded cash contributions still played a role in New York campaigns , the same former strategist , who has worked in both Republican and Democratic contests , put it this way : " I just can not believe that the built-in system of cash contributions that had prevailed in this city for years could have been stopped overnight . It 's not possible . " Campaign experts , while acknowledging that such practices continue , say at the same time that there is much less illegal money involved in politics today . This is , they say , partly because of the new , tighter law . And there is another reason : because of the rise of media politics . Street operations simply are not as important as they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio and television advertising is more effective . During Mr. Koch 's 1977 mayoral campaign , for example , nearly every penny raised by the campaign went to pay for television and radio advertising , which , clearly , reaches more people than do campaign workers ringing doorbells . Cash is n't at all helpful in buying radio and television time ; the stations demand checks . Plenty of money is still doled out on Election Day , however . In 1977 , according to Mr. Cuomo 's former campaign manager , Michael Dowd , the Cuomo mayoral campaign spent $50,000 on primary day . And the official campaign financial reports of Mr. Carey 's re-election campaign show that $41,225 , much of it in cash ? of a total of $5,086,508 spent on his re-election ? went out on Election Day . Officials of the Cuomo and Carey campaigns say that all of that money was legal and recorded . The unrecorded cash that does find its way into campaigns , say political campaign professionals , comes from a wide variety of often unidentified sources , out of sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , by committees formed separately from the central campaign committee , and by workers on the street . " A campaign is so big , with so many people involved , it is not inconceivable to me " that illegal cash turns up in campaigns , says Ken Auletta , who managed Howard J. Samuels 's gubernatorial campaign in 1974 and says he was unaware of any cash contributions . " You can just set a tone and try to enforce it . But there is no foolproof scheme to avoid it .
