txt  | the Earth and other planets is relatively feeble . Then Asaph Hall , in Washington , found two tiny satellites , Phobos and Deimos , which whirl round Mars at distances of only a few thousand miles . As soon as the orbits of these moonlets had been worked out , which took only a few days , the mass of Mars itself could be determined . In the same way , we can find the mass of a star much more easily if there is a companion star nearby upon which the gravitational effects may be measured . When we look at the spectral types of binary stars , we find some interesting laws . For almost identical twins , such as Gamma Virginis , the spectra are nearly always similar . When there is a marked difference in brightness between the two components , the spectra too are different . If both stars belong to the Main Sequence , the companion is generally of later type than the primary ; if the primary is a giant , the companion is either a giant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Though the sequence 0 , B , A ... M is no longer thought to be evolutionary , we still term the hot stars early ' and the red ones late ' in spectral types ; for instance Arcturus , of type K , is said to be of later type than Sirius , whose spectrum is of type A. ) Let me stress , however , that the law is not rigid , and not all binaries obey it . How were binaries formed ? It is tempting to suppose that a system of this kind is due to the break-up of an originally single star , because of excessively rapid rotation , but nowadays this attractive idea has fallen into disfavour , and it is usually thought that the two members of a binary were formed close together , so that they have remained linked . So far I have been talking about binaries in which both components are visible in small telescopes . This is not , however , the case with one of the most remarkable binaries in the sky : Sirius , the Dog-Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that it is by no means a supergiant . True , it is 26 times more luminous than the Sun , but it owes its great brightness to the fact that it is less than nine light-years away ; of the first-magnitude stars , only Alpha Centauri is closer . Naturally , Sirius has an unusually large proper motion , which is why Edmond Halley was able to show that it had moved perceptibly across the sky since the days of Hipparchus and Ptolemy.  | ( top ) Prominences , photographed on 27 March 1971 , at 1 th 13m , by Ramon Lane .

Chapter Twelve SUPERNOV7E ? AND PULSARS IN THE YEAR 1054 , Chinese and Japanese astronomers were surprised to see a brilliant new star in the constellation of Taurus , the Bull . It was so bright that it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lasted for several months before it faded away . No accurate observations of it were made , and after a while the strange guest star ' was more or less forgotten . Then , in 1572 , there came another outburst of the same kind , in another part of the sky . On 11 November the young Danish stargazer Tycho Brahe , later to become the greatest observer of his time , made a discovery which was to alter not only his life , but also ? to some extent , at least ? the whole history of astronomy . In his own words : " In the evening , after sunset , when , according to my habit , I was contemplating the stars in a clear sky , I noticed that a new and unusual star , surpassing all the other stars in brilliancy , was shining almost directly above my head ; and since I had , almost from boyhood , known all the stars of the heavens perfectly ( there is no great difficulty in attaining that knowledge ) , it was quite evident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place in the sky , not even the smallest , to say nothing of a star so conspicuously bright as this . I was so astonished at this sight that I was not ashamed to doubt the trustworthiness of my own eyes . But when I observed that others , too , having this place pointed out to them , could see that there really was a star there , I had no further doubts . A miracle indeed , either the greatest of all that have occurred in the whole range of nature since the beginning of the world , or one certainly that is to be classed with those attested by the Holy Oracles . " Tycho was an extraordinary man . He was proud , grasping and frequently cruel ; he was also a firm believer in astrology , the superstition of the stars ; and he could never bring himself to believe that the Earth could be a planet moving round the Sun . To him , the Earth was the supreme body in the universe .  | full list of catalogued pairs runs into thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs available to even a modest telescope would need a great deal of work . Incidentally , there is scope here for the serious , well-equipped amateur observer . By the use of a measuring device known as a micrometer , attached to a telescope of adequate aperture ( say a 6-inch refractor ) he can make himself very useful in re-measuring the position angles and separations of binary pairs . Many of the published values are completely out of date ? yet they keep on appearing in star catalogues , textbooks and yearly almanacs . It is time that they were revised . Optical doubles are of no special interest , but binaries are important in many ways . In particular , their movements give us a reliable clue as to their masses . If we know the parallax of a binary , and also the orbits described by the two components as they move round their common centre of gravity , we can work out the combined mass of the system compared with that of the Sun ; and if we can measure the orbit of either component separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars as well . For instance , all the necessary information is to hand ( Fig. 43 ) in the case of the splendid binary Zeta Herculis , where the magnitudes are 3 and 61 and the period is 34 years . We can tell that the primary is slightly more massive than the Sun , while the secondary has about half the solar mass . This may not sound particularly important , but actually it is of vital significance . It is hard to obtain a direct measure of the mass of a single star , and in fact we can not do so ; we have to depend upon theory , and this is where the binaries come to the rescue . Incidentally , the most massive star known to us is a binary , known as Plaskett 's Star in honour of the astronomer who first drew attention to it . The components are about equal , and very much more massive than the Sun ? but Plaskett 's Star is extremely remote , so that it is faint . The lesson of all this is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do on Earth . Moreover , we have an example of the same problem very much nearer home . To measure the mass of a planet , one way is to work out the effects which it produces in the movements of other bodies . Up to 1877 Mars , which is a small world , was believed to be moonless , and its mass was not easy to find , since its pull upon  | where Bessel had predicted . It is known officially as Sirius B , and unofficially as the Pup , since Sirius itself is the Dog-Star . The magnitude of the Pup is 8i , which means that if it could be seen on its own it would be easy enough in a small telescope , but it is so overpowered by the light of the primary that it is not at all obvious . The position angle and separation alter fairly quickly , as the period is only 50 years ; the distance will be at its greatest ( 11.5 seconds of arc ) in 1975 . It has been claimed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never yet seen it with my own 12 finch reflector , mainly because Sirius never rises high above the British horizon . When Clark made his discovery , the Sirius riddle ' was regarded as closed . The Companion had been expected , and it had been duly found , which was most satisfactory . It was ten magnitudes or about 1o,000 times fainter than the primary , and had presumably about 1/36o the luminosity of the Sun . It was assumed to be a cool , red star of late spectral type . Then , in 1915 , W. S. Adams , of the Mount Wilson Observatory in California , produced an astronomical bombshell . He was able to study the spectrum of the Companion , and to say that the results were unexpected would be to put it mildly . Instead of being cool and red , the Pup turned out to have a curious spectrum indicating a white star with a surface temperature of 8,000 degrees , as against the modest 6,000 degrees of the Sun . The supposedly dim red object had revealed itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of facts which seemed to add up to pure nonsense . The mass of the Pup , as shown from the combined movements of it and the bright star , was very nearly equal to the Sun 's . The temperature measurement showed that each square inch of the surface was radiating roughly 34 times more light and heat energy than a square inch of the solar surface . Therefore , the surface area of the Sun had to be 36o x 34 times that of the Pup ? which led to the conclusion that the diameter of the Pup must be only 24,000 miles , a mere three times as great as that of the Earth and much less than that of a large planet such as Jupiter , Saturn or Uranus ( Fig. 45 ) . Now let us check the density of the Pup material . What we  | Size of Sirius B ( the Pup ) , compared with the Earth . have to do is to pack the mass of the Sun into a globe 24,000 miles across ( remembering that the Sun itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to do so is to make the material very dense , and the calculated value turns out to be 70,000 times the density of water , so that if you could take a matchbox and fill it with matter of this kind the total weight would be more than a ton . Near the centre of the star the density would be greater still , and you could pack perhaps 50 tons into your matchbox . It is hardly surprising that at first astronomers refused to accept any such value . It seemed quite incredible , and the easy way out was to suppose that some mistake had been made in the measurement of the temperature . Yet the facts could not be denied . The Pup was certainly faint , and it was certainly hot , so that the only solution was to give it an extremely small diameter . Gradually , the puzzled scientists came to the conclusion that super-dense ' material must exist after all . Were there any other stars of the same kind ? This was a question of vital importance , and before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pup represented a very common class of star . Nowadays we call them White Dwarfs ; they lie to the lower left of the H-R Diagram , and there can be no doubt  | that they are stars which have used up their nuclear energy , so that they are bankrupt of their reserves . The Pup is by no means the extreme example . Kuiper 's Star ( or , to give it its official designation , A.C.+70 ? 8247 ) is no larger than Mars , with a diameter of about 4,000 miles , but its mass is the same as the Sun 's . The material is incredibly heavy , so that if we could take a cube of it with each side of the cube measuring one-tenth of an inch , and bring it to the Earth , the weight would be about half a ton . White Dwarfs were mentioned in the last chapter , and I stressed then that their densities are so great because the atoms in them are broken up or ionized ? and hence can be packed together with very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . One way to explain what is meant is to go back to the admittedly misleading analogy between an atom and the Solar System . If you took the Sun and the planets individually and forced them close together , they would take up much less room than the Solar System actually does , because the orbit of the outermost planet has a radius of over 3,000 million miles ; the proportion of wasted room in the Solar System is about the same as for an ordinary atom , but in a White Dwarf the components are crammed together . ( Remember , though , that it is dangerous to take this sort of comparison at all literally , since we can not regard the particles in an atom as solid lumps . ) Before leaving the Sirius pair , I can not resist saying something about a problem which has always fascinated me . The spectrum of the primary is of Type A , and the colour is pure white ; the rainbow flashes seen when the star is low down are due solely to the effects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century A.D. , distinctly stated that he saw Sirius as red ; so did some of the ancient Egyptians and Assyrians . Ptolemy was a careful and reliable observer ; from his home in Alexandria , Sirius rises much higher than it ever does in Britain , so that the twinkling is less violent . Certainly Sirius is not red today , and it has been colourless ever since the tenth century A.D. , when it was described by the great Arab astronomer Al-Sufi . This is a true puzzle . There seems no reason why Ptolemy and the other ancient observers could make so obvious a  | In the ordinary way , a star with large proper motion travels across the sky in a uniform manner , but in 1834 Friedrich Bessel ? later to achieve extra fame as being the first man to measure the distance of a star ? realized that Sirius was behaving oddly . Its motion was erratic , so that instead of travelling in a direct line it was waving ' its way along . Each wave ' was very tiny , and took about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . No single star could possibly act in such a fashion , and Bessel therefore suggested that Sirius must have a binary companion , too faint to be seen and yet massive enough to pull on the bright star and account for the waving motion ( Fig. 44 ) . Bessel reached this conclusion not long before his death , in 1844 , which is interesting because research of rather the same kind was The wobbling ' of Sirius as it moves against the background of more distant stars ; the positions are shown to either side of the average track . The perturbations are due to the White Dwarf companion . going on in connection with our own Solar System . The planet Uranus , discovered by Herschel in 1781 , had been causing trouble , as it obstinately refused to move according to the path which had been worked out for it . Two mathematicians , Adams in England and Le Verrier in France , had decided that it must be affected by an unknown planet , and by studying the wanderings of Uranus they managed to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Neptune . The crux of the matter was that Neptune 's position was worked out before astronomers actually started to look for it with their telescopes . In the same way , the position of the binary companion to Sirius was calculated , but the faint star refused to show itself . In 1862 Clark , a well-known American telescope-maker , was testing a new refractor with a 20-inch object-glass . He turned it toward Sirius , and saw a dim dot of light beside the brilliant star . The dot was , of course , the long-awaited Companion , just  | B will have a Doppler shift to the red . In Position 2 , the spectral lines of A will be superimposed on those of B , because there will be no Doppler shifts at all , and the result will be a spectrum which appears perfectly normal in so far as the line positions are concerned . If , therefore , we come across a star A spectroscopic binary . ( Upper ) Star A is approaching the Earth , and shows a violet shift in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift , so that the combined spectrum shows a double line . ( Lower ) The motion is transverse , and the line appears single . whose spectral lines are periodically doubled , we may be sure that we are dealing with a very close binary . Such is the brighter component of the Mizar pair , as E. C. Pickering found as long ago as 1889 . The lines appear double at regular intervals , and it is found that the orbital period of the twins ' is 202 days . Another example is Beta Auriga , near the brilliant Capella , also studied in 1889 . Thousands of these spectroscopic binaries are now known . Capella is a case in point . In ordinary telescopes it appears single , but the spectroscope shows it to be a binary ; the components are about 8o million miles apart , and have an orbital period of just over too days . One star is of type G , with a mass 41 times that of the Sun ; its F5-type companion has 32 times the Sun 's mass . Modern instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there are few instruments powerful enough to split it . Up to now the spectroscopic binary with the shortest known period is AM Camelopardalis , GUIDE TO THE STARS in the obscure constellation of the Giraffe . The orbital time is a mere 17 minutes ! We also know of many cases in which the spectrum of the companion star is too faint to be seen at all . This means that the lines due to the primary will oscillate to and fro around their mean position ? to the violet side when the primary is approaching , to the red side when it is receding . Binary stars have proved to be so common that some astronomers regard them as the rule rather than the exception . Less common , though still reasonably frequent , are family parties ' of stars ? triple , quadruple and so on . Mizar is a good example . As we have noted , it is a visual binary , and the brighter component is itself a spectroscopic binary , so that we have three stars in association . But an even finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from Vega . Epsilon Lyre is a naked-eye double , and people with normal eyesight will have no trouble in splitting it when the sky is dark and clear . The distance between the two components is 208 seconds of arc . A 3-inch telescope will show that each component is again double , so that we have a true quadruple system ( Fig. 47 ) . All four stars are similar in luminosity and spectral type ; all are considerably more powerful than the Sun . The movements of the stars in the Epsilon Lyrae system are decidedly complex . Each close pair has a revolution period of several hundreds of years , but the two pairs take an immense time to complete one circuit round their common centre of gravity . In fact , no measurable shift has been found , so that the period may well amount to more than a million years , and all DOUBLE STARS we can really say is that there is a definite physical connection . It is always worth looking at Epsilon Lyra , since any modest instrument will show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fainter member of the two Twins . The main star is a binary ; the two components differ in brightness by about a magnitude , and the period is 350 years . Each star is a spectroscopic binary , the periods being three and nine days respectively . At a distance of 73 seconds of arc lies a third member of the system ? Castor C ( sometimes called YY Geminorum ) , made up of two Red Dwarfs moving round each other in 19 hours . The Red Dwarf pair certainly orbits the main quadruplets , but must take millions of years to do so . This is a real stellar family . Castor is not the single dot of light which appears to the naked eye ; it is made up of six separate suns , four brilliant and two dim , arranged in pairs . It is logical to assume that all six are of about the same age , and were formed by the same process , but they have had very different life-stories . Yet another interesting system ? a triple , this time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superb visual binary , and Proxima , which has the distinction of being the nearest star to the Solar System , is also a member of the family , as is shown by the fact that it has the same motion through space . Proxima is a celestial glow-worm ; despite its nearness ( only 4.2 light-years ) it shines as a star of only magnitude 10.7 . For other examples of multiple stars we can turn back to Orion , that magnificent constellation which seems to be able to supply us with anything we may want in the nature of stellar wonders . In the gaseous nebula which marks the Hunter 's Sword we find Theta Orionis , known as the Trapezium because of the arrangement of its four chief components . Sigma Orionis , between the Nebula and the stars of the Belt , is another multiple , less striking than the Trapezium but well worth examination . There is a great fascination in these pairs and groups of stars . Wide or close , optical or binary , coloured or colourless , they can provide the casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the well-equipped amateur with the chance to do some extremely useful research . What if we lived on a planet circling round a binary star ? I2I GUIDE TO THE STARS We would have two suns instead of one . There might be a huge Red Giant accompanied by a dim but massive White Dwarf , or alternatively we might be treated to the spectacle of a yellow sun with a blue companion , which would certainly provide us with colour effects beyond the wildest dreams of even a surrealist artist . Whether such binary systems do have families of planets remains to be seen . Meantime we must be content with our own single sun , which sends us so much radiation that we do not always appreciate that it is nothing more than one of the Galaxy 's Yellow Dwarfs. 122 Chapter Ten VARIABLE STARS ON THE EVENING of 12 November , 1782 , an eighteen-year-old boy named John Goodricke was busy observing the stars . He was a serious astronomer , but an unusual one ; he was deaf and dumb , and had been from birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyesight or his brain . Goodricke was particularly interested in Algol , or Beta Persei . In the ordinary way Algol is about as bright as the Pole Star , but on this particular occasion something was happening to it ; it was fading , and continued to do so for several hours until it had dropped to magnitude 3 2 . Then , after less than half an hour , it began to increase once more until it had regained its former brightness . Goodricke was not the first to observe this curious behaviour in Algol . Geminano Montanari , an Italian professor of mathematics , had noticed it as long ago as 1669 . Yet nobody had explained it satisfactorily , and Algol was obviously different in type from the other known variable star ' , Mira in the constellation of Cetus . Goodricke believed that he had the answer , and in the following year he wrote a paper in which he suggested that the changes in brightness shown by Algol were due to the periodical eclipse of the bright star by a fainter binary companion . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragedy that this gifted deaf-mute should have died soon afterwards at the early age of twenty-one . Had he lived , he would have done much for astronomical science . Algol is easy to find . The best pointer to the constellation Perseus is Cassiopeia ; an imaginary line from two of the stars in the W leads on to Mirphak or Alpha Persei , of the second magnitude , and Algol is not far off ( Fig. 48 ) . Moreover , it is very prominent when at maximum , as it is for most of the time . For 2 days II hours it shines steadily ( or virtually so ) , but then fades down to minimum in only five hours . After minimum , a further five hours is needed for return to maximum , // after which nothing much happens for a further 2 days 11 hours . In fact , Algol winks ' regularly . The best way to show the behaviour of Algol , or any other star which changes in brightness , is by means of a light-curve , in which magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slight secondary minimum between the two main winks ; this is caused by the eclipse of the fainter component by the brighter , and is too slight to be detected without sensitive equipment . There is a rather interesting point about the name Algol ' , which is Arabic , and means the head of a a ghul being a female demon with an unprepossessing appearance and even more unprepossessing habits . In classical legend the star is equally sinister , since it marks the severed head of the Gorgon , Medusa , still carried by Perseus in his journey across the sky . This has led to the suggestion that the Arabs of a thousand years ago knew about Algol 's strange behaviour . Modern scholars tend to disagree , and it is not now thought that the variability was known before Montanari discovered it in 1669 , but it is certainly appropriate that Medusa 's head should be marked by a winking star . Goodricke 's suggestion sounded reasonable enough when he first made it , but for a long time there was no proof . Sir William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his largest telescopes , but could never see it as anything but a single point . This is not surprising , since we now know that the distance between the two components of the binary is not much more than six million miles ; the angular separation is too small for the components to be seen individually , and so , as usual , we turn back to the spectroscope . It appears that the Algol system is very complex . The brightest member is of spectral type B8 , with a surface tempera- VARIABLE STARS ture of 12,000 degrees and a diameter of about 21 million miles . The secondary is larger but dimmer ; its spectrum is of later type , and the surface temperature is appreciably less than the Sun 's , while the diameter is three million miles . Obviously , then , the principal wink ' observed by Goodricke takes place when the secondary ( B ) passes in front of A ; the smaller 3 minimum when B is hidden by A was too slight for him to detect . Actually , the eclipses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 ) . Algol A and B move together a more distant component , Algol C ; the orbital ; period is about i year 9 months . brighter star is eclipsed by the C has never been seen visually but its spectrum can be observed , and proves to be of either late A or early F type , so that the star is more luminous than Algol B. It is thought that there may be a fourth member of the system which moves round the bright binary in a period of about 1881 years . I have already discussed spectroscopic binaries ? Mizar is a good example ? and in point of fact the only difference is that with Algol , the orbit is tilted so that we see its plane almost edge-on . It is not truly variable , and for this reason the term eclipsing binary ' is much more appropriate . Algol is by no means unique . Many similar pairs are known , and the list runs into many hundreds ; a few such stars , notably Lambda Tauri and Delta Librae , are visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary Kids ' , close to Capella , which have received a tremendous amount of attention from astronomers during the past decade or two . The Haedi , or Kids , are three in number , and make up a // Capella triangle which does not look superficially very exciting ( Fig. 50 ) . One of the trio , Eta Auriga , is entirely unremarkable . ( For the record , it is a B-type star , about seventy times as luminous as the Sun . ) The other two , Zeta and Epsilon Auriquae , are eclipsing systems of very unusual kind . Zeta ? once dignified by a proper name , Sadatoni , which has fallen into virtual disuse ? does not show violent or changes in light , and the variations are is a very not easy to follow with the naked eye . interesting eclipsing Also , the eclipses are infrequent , Epsilon the period is 972 days ( as against less Aurigae is also a system than three days for Algol ) . One component is a hot B7-type Main Sequence it may be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as brilliant as the include a black hole . Sun , and with a diameter of some three million miles . The companion is a K4-type supergiant with a much lower surface temperature , but of immense size . Its diameter is over 200 million miles , larger than that of the Earth 's orbit round the Sun ( Fig. 51 ) . The most careful watch is kept upon Zeta Aurigae when the red supergiant is eclipsing the B7 star . Even before the main eclipse begins , the blue star fades slightly , showing that it is shining through the vast , tenuous atmosphere of its corn-panion . For some time after the start of the actual eclipse , the light from the B7 star is still to be seen , cutting through the outer layers of the supergiant . This shows that these outer layers must be highly rarefied , with a density of perhaps one five- Aurigae , millionth that of water . At this time Mercury , Venus and the the spectrum of the combined pair Earth round the Sun . is very complicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supergiant and those of the blue star ; but as the blue star passes behind the supergiant its spectrum is gradually blotted out , to reappear before the end of the eclipse . Epsilon Auriga , the third of the Kids , is even more remarkable . It is certainly an eclipsing system with a period of 27 years ; but as it may involve what is called a Black Hole it will be better for me to reserve it until Chapter 13 . Not all eclipsing systems are made up of giants or supergiants . Dwarf pairs exist as well , a good example being Castor C or YY Geminorum , which is an eclipsing binary made up of two Red Dwarfs . UX Ursa Majoris , in the Great Bear , is different again . The components are not very unequal ; each has about half the diameter of the Sun , but with a mass greater than that of the Sun , so that they are both over-dense and underluminous . The orbital period is only 4 hours , and each eclipse lasts for a mere forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sheliak . It is easy to find , since its position close to Vega makes it quite unmistakable , and its neighbour Gamma Lyra makes an excellent comparison star . The variations in light were discovered in 1784 by Goodricke , only a short time before his death , and are quite unlike those of Algol . At maximum the magnitude is 31 , but there is no period of constant brightness , since changes are always going on . The sequence of events is always the same ( Fig. 52 ) . Starting from maximum , the star fades 4 3.8 down to below the fourth magnitude ; it then recovers , but when it fades again the minimum is less pronounced ( magnitude 3U . The succeeding minimum is again . deep , so that deep and shallow minima take place alternately . The overall period is 12 days 22 hours 22 minutes ? apparently increasing at a rate of about one minute in six years , which is slight but measurable . The main component of Beta Lyrae is hot and bluish-white ; it is also very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUIDE TO THE STARS 1,100 light-years . The secondary is less hot , but its spectrum has never been observed , so that nobody knows just what sort of star it is . The twins must be so close together that they almost touch , and each is drawn out into the shape of an egg ; material is thrown off , and the stars must be surrounded by streamers of glowing gas . Only a few hundreds of Beta Lyrae  - -  type stars are known , but there are also the W Ursa Majoris variables , in which the components are equally close together and equally distorted by tidal forces , but are of later spectral type and considerably less luminous . I have included the eclipsing binaries in this chapter simply because they do show light-changes , though they are not truly variable . If we could look at Algol from some other vantage point , so that no eclipses would occur , the light would be quite steady , as shown in Fig. 53 . So let us turn now to the genuine variables , beginning with a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me say at once that any short list is bound to be open to criticism , because variable star studies are much more involved than used to be thought . The main classes are : 1 . Long-period variables , sometimes called Mira stars . 2 . Semi-regular variables , such as Betelgeux in Orion . 3 . Irregular variables , which are of various kinds . 4 . Cepheids , with regular light-curves and short periods of from 3 and 50 days . 5 . RR Lyres stars , also quite regular , but with very short periods of less than a day . 6 . Flare stars , which I have already described . 7 . Novae , or temporary stars ' . 8 . Supernova , involving the destruction of the star in its original form . It seems fitting to begin with the Wonderful Star ' , Mira in Cetus ( the Whale ) , which has the honour of being the first variable star to be recognized . The story began on 13 August , 1596 , when David Fabricius , a Dutch pastor , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude . It seemed to be an ordinary star , but a few weeks later , when he looked again , it had disappeared . This was certainly odd , and one might have expected Fabricius to follow the matter up , but apparently he never did . ( En passant , Fabricius met with a curious fate . In 1616 he preached a sermon in which he hinted that he knew the identity of the member of his congregation who had stolen one of his geese . Evidently his surmise was correct , because he was assassinated before he could divulge the name of the culprit . ) Seven years after Fabricius ' first observation , Johann Bayer was drawing up his famous catalogue when he saw the star again , and gave it the Greek letter Omicron . This time it was of the fourth magnitude , and Bayer did not connect his Omicron Ceti with the disappearing star of 1596 . Again it vanished , and again nobody paid any attention . The star was seen now and again between 1603 and 1638 , and eventually Phocylides Holwarda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanishes regularly . Mira 's period , or interval between successive maxima , is 331 days on average , but both the period and the magnitude // GUIDE TO THE STARS range alter within reasonably narrow limits ( Fig. 54 ) . In August 1969 , for instance , I saw Mira shining as a conspicuous star of the second magnitude ? I made it 2.3 at its peak , only slightly F inferior to the Pole Star ? but at most maxima it does not even reach the third magnitude . At its faintest it falls to magnitude so that it is beyond the range of ordinary binoculars . Actually , Mira is generally visible with the naked eye for only about 18 weeks of its 47-week period , so do not be surprised if you look up toward Cetus and fail to see it . ( Of course , it is always easy to locate if you have an adequate telescope and a set of star-charts . ) Look at Mira , and you will notice that it is red . This is true of most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . The diameter of Mira is believed to be of the order of 250 million miles , and its mass is ten times that of the Sun . Though Mira is over a hundred light-years away it is the closest of the long-period variables , and is the only one which can become really prominent with the naked eye . Mira has a faint companion ( which is either a White Dwarf or else some kind of sub-dwarf ) , but it is not an eclipsing binary ; its variations are intrinsic . It alters both in size and in temperature . At its hottest the surface layer attains over 2,500 degrees , but at its coolest it is 700 degrees less . The star swells and shrinks , so that we must regard it as unstable . The spectrum , too , is variable , and at times there are bright lines as well as the familiar dark absorption bands always to be found in the spectra of Red Giants . Over three thousand Mira-type variables are known in our Galaxy by now , but since they are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even so , there are numbers of them within the range of the amateur observer equipped with a modest telescope . One is Chi Cygni , in the Cross of the Swan , which has an exceptionally large range . At its brightest it may reach the third magnitude , but at minimum it falls to below 14 , which means that it disappears below the limit of // even a fair-sized telescope . The average period is 407 days , and the spectrum is of the relatively rare type S , so that Chi Cygni is very red indeed . It is also a strong emitter in infra-red ; if our eyes were sensitive to these long wavelengths , Chi Cygni would shine as one of the most brilliant objects in the whole sky . Not many variables are bright enough to be given proper names or Greek letters , and a system was worked out which seems to be quite satisfactory . When a star was found to be variable , it was given the letter R in its particular constellation ; the next variable was lettered S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters from R to Z were used in pairs . Then came the earlier letters of the alphabet . If all these were used up , the nomenclature scheme is to use a V followed by a suitable number ; thus V334 Cygni was the first variable to be found in Cygnus after the end of the alphabetical series . Among famous Mira-type stars are R Leonis in the Lion , near Regulus ; R Cygni and U Cygni , in the Swan ; R Leporis , the so-called Crimson Star ' in the little constellation of the Hare ; and U Orionis , near the borders of Orion and Taurus . All are easy to see with binoculars when at maximum , but all become faint when near minimum . U Orionis is an awkward star . Its period is 372 days , so that it comes to maximum only about a week later every year ; and at present ( 1974 ) maximum occurs in the summer , when the star is too near the Sun to be observed at all . All the Mira stars are somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , R Hydrae , there seems to have been a systematic change . The period was about 500 days when the fluctuations were first noted , by Maraldi in 1704 , but nowadays the period is less than 400 days . The change seems to be real , even though it would be dangerous to put too much faith in the old observations . Whether it represents something permanent , connected with the star 's evolution , we do not know . Next we come to the semi-regular variables , which behave in a rather different way . Their fluctuations are often very slow , and they do not generally have a range of more than a couple of magnitudes , against over ten magnitudes for the Mira-type star Chi Cygni . The periods of the semi-regular variables are very rough , and one can never predict quite what they will do next . Betelgeux in Orion is a classic example . // Officially the period is given as 2,070 days , or between five and six years , but the irregularities are so marked that one can hardly give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best it can almost match Rigel ; at its faintest , it is comparable with Aldebaran . Here too we have a swelling and shrinking process , together with a change of temperature which is , admittedly , fairly slight . Vast though Betelgeux may be , the semi-regular variable Rasalgethi or Alpha Herculis is even larger . Its diameter may be over 400 million miles , and it is surrounded by an extensive envelope of thin gases spreading out to over 600 million miles , so that it is a supergiant of extreme type . Even though it is over 400 light-years away it is quite bright ; it ranges between magnitudes 3 and 4 , and is always easy to see with the naked eye . It is not hard to identify , because the nearby secondmagnitude star Rasalhague or Alpha Ophiuchi acts as a marker for it . Rasalgethi may give us some clue as to the real nature of these semi-regular stars . In the outermost layers , the gaseous envelope may condense into patchy clouds , which could do something to veil the red star and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star itself is intrinsically variable as well . Passing over the so-called RV Tauri stars , which are G to K type giants and have reasonably well-marked periods with alternate deep and shallow minima , and doing no more than mention the variables with a very small magnitude range ( too small to be detected without sensitive equipment ) we come to the eruptive stars , which again are of various kinds . Among the most interesting are the dwarf nova ' , otherwise called U Geminorum or SS Cygni stars , since U Geminorum was the first of the class to be discovered ( by the English astronomer J. R. Hind , in 1855 ) and SS Cygni is the brightest and most closely studied of them ( Fig. 55 ) . A dwarf nova stays at its minimum brightness for most of the time , with only slight fluctuations . At fairly predictable intervals there is an outburst , and the star brightens up by several magnitudes , remaining at maximum for a few days before declining once more . Not all maxima are of the same length or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between successive maxima constant . With SS Cygni the average interval is fifty days , but with U Geminorum it is 103 days , and with the much fainter star UV Persei it is as much as 300 days . For some time nobody was sure whether these strange variables were very luminous and remote , or relatively nearby and feeble . It now seems that they lie within a few hundred light-years of us , and are dwarfs . It has been found , too , that they are close binaries ; a typical system is made up of a rather underluminous yellow star with a surface temperature about the same as that of the Sun , together with a White Dwarf . The exact nature of the outbursts is still uncertain . It is not likely that they originate in the yellow star ; they could be due to the White Dwarf , but are more probably bound up with streams and clouds of gas associated with both components . There have been suggestions , too , that the SS Cygni stars evolve from the W Ursa Majoris type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have two yellow dwarfs orbiting each other in virtual contact , so that the movements of the associated gas-clouds and streams are very complicated . Variable star observers are also intrigued by the Z Camelopardalis stars , which are not too unlike the dwarf nova except that they sometimes seem to forget that they are variable , and stay almost constant for weeks or months on end before resuming what to them is normal behaviour . The next irregular variables are quite different . The bestknown member of the class is R Coronae , in the Northern Crown , not far from Arcturus in the sky ( Fig. 56 ) . Less than fifty R Corona ' stars are known , and most of them are always very faint . R Corona itself is the exception ; normally it is of about the 133 sixth magnitude , on the fringe of nakedeye visibility , and changes very little , but at unpredictable intervals it falls to a deep minimum , sometimes becoming so dim that small telescopes lose it completely ( Fig. 57 ) . instance , it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelfth magnitude ; it had begun to decline in late February , and not until the late summer was it back to normal . On the other hand there were no minima at all between 1925 and 1934 . This was before my time , but I imagine that observers began to lose patience with its reluctance to perform ' ! R Coronae stars are very poor in hydrogen , but are rich in carbon . It has been suggested that the minima may be due to the building-up of carbon particles in the very outer part of the star 's atmosphere , resulting in blanketing of the radiation , so // that in fact the star temporarily hides itself coyly behind a veil of soot . The spectral changes are very complex indeed , and nobody can pretend that we really know how R Corona stars function . They are giants of high luminosity , and are probably well advanced in their life-stories . It is a pity that there are so few of them . Though R Coronae stars are old , irregular variables of the T Tauri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still contracting toward the Main Sequence , and many of them are involved in nebulosity . Incidentally , stars of this kind are very strong infra-red emitters , and theorists are becoming more and more interested in them . Their fluctuations seem to be quite random , so that clearly they have yet to settle down to their period of steady , sober existence . As a slight but justifiable digression , this seems to me the moment to return to two other remarkable stars which are undoubtedly very young , and must be classed as variable inasmuch as they show undoubted changes in output . In 1936 a very faint star in Orion , now called FU Orionis , suddenly increased to 250 times its usual brightness , and after five months it had reached the tenth magnitude , since when it has stayed almost constant . In 1969 another star , this time in Cygnus ( V.1o57 Cygni : the constellation contains so many variables that the alphabetical series was exhausted long ago ) brightened up by six magnitudes , taking 250 days to do so . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two stars , both of which are involved in nebulosity , abruptly blew away ' their surrounding dust-clouds , so that for the first time we could see them properly ; they too are very strong in the infra-red , and it is logical to associate this long-wavelength radiation with heated dusty material . Over the years , no doubt other youthful stars will be seen to burst forth in the same way . But of all variable stars , the most important to astronomers are the Cepheids . They take their name from Delta Cephei , in the far north , whose fluctuations were discovered in 1784 by the keen-eyed Goodricke . The chart shows how to find it ( Fig. .58 ) ; two members of the W of Cassiopeia show the way to it , and it is easily located , because it forms a small triangle with its neighbours Epsilon and Zeta Cephei . The magnitude ranges from 3.7 to 4.3 in a period of 5 days 9 hours , and the period // is absolutely regular , so that it may be worked out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 59 ) is not completely smooth , as the increase from minimum to maximum is steeper than the subsequent drop , but we can always tell how bright Delta Cephei will be at any particular moment . This time we are dealing with a regular pulsation , involving changes in diameter , temperature and spectrum . The temperature range amounts to as much as 2,000 degrees , and the spectral type changes between F4 and G6 . Like all its kind , Delta Cephei is a yellow supergiant . Other naked-eye Cepheids are known ; in the northern hemisphere there are Eta Aquilae and Zeta Geminorum , and in the southern sky Kappa Pavonis and Beta Dorados . Telescopic Cepheids are numerous , and over six hundred have been found in our Galaxy alone . Because they are powerful stars , they are visible over tremendous distances . Cepheids are of various classes . Delta Cephei itself is the prototype of the classical or type I Cepheid ; type II Cepheids , less common and less luminous , are some times called W Virginis stars after their best-known member ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One the Pole Star . The period is // just under four days , but the changes in brightness are too small to be noticed with the naked eye . Cepheids are pulsating stars , all of which have evolved off the Main Sequence . In a star there are two forces to be considered : the weight of the material , tending to make the star shrink , and the pressure of the hot gases within . In a stable star these forces balance each other out , but in an unstable star such as a Cepheid they do not . If we begin the cycle with a contraction , the pressure inside will build up until it has become great enough to overcome the effects of the weight of the outer layers , and the shrinking will stop , to be followed by expansion . Now the weight of the overlying layers will decrease , but the pressure inside will decrease faster ? and so after a while contraction will begin again . Once more there will be an overshoot ' , and so the pulsations continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the analogy is not really very accurate . The pulsation time for a very large , rarefied star would logically be expected to be longer than that for a smaller , denser star , and it would not be surprising to find that the period of variation of a Cepheid would be linked with its real luminosity . This is in fact the case , and the period-luminosity ' law is well-defined . The rule is : The longer the period , the more powerful the star . Thus Zeta Geminorum ( period 1 o ? I days ) is more luminous than Delta Cephei itself ( period 5.4 days ) . And since the two stars appear almost exactly equal in brightness as seen from the Earth , Zeta Geminorum must therefore be the more distant of the two . The original discovery was more or less fortuitous . In 1912 Miss Henrietta Leavitt , at Harvard , was studying photographs of one of the southern star-systems , the Small Magellanic Cloud , about which I will have more to say later . The Cloud lies well beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 ) . It contains plenty of Cepheids , and in studying them Miss Leavitt found that the apparently brighter variables always had the longer periods . The essential point here is that to all intents and purposes the variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud can be regarded as being at the same distance from us just as we can say that for all practical purposes Chichester and Bognor Regis are the // that at least some readers will feel inclined to take up the work , because it is useful as well as enjoyable ? particularly , I think , with those variables which are always apt to spring surprises on us . Can the Sun be regarded as a variable star ? Strictly speaking , no ; its output of light and heat remains virtually constant , which is very lucky for us , since even a small alteration would result in our being fried or frozen . Yet we know that there is a semi-regular cycle of about eleven years , and that the numbers of sunspots wax and wane in a marked manner . Sunspots are associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also is linked with the solar cycle . Therefore we may regard the Sun as magnetically variable , even though its overall field is weak . Finally , I must say something about the secular variables ' , where the changes are slow enough to be imperceptible except over very long periods . The first star-catalogues which may be regarded as fairly reliable were drawn up many centuries ago , and there are a few cases of stars which seem to have altered in brightness since then . The best example is Megrez or Delta Ursae Majoris , in the Great Bear . Its present magnitude is 3.3 , so that it is more than a magnitude fainter than Mizar ; yet Ptolemy and the other old observers made it equal to the other stars of the Bear , so that it may have faded . Even now it is suspected of occasional fluctuations , so that it could be an irregular variable which remains steady for many years at a time . Castor in Gemini used to be ranked superior to its twin ' , Pollux , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old estimates are correct either Castor has decreased or Pollux has brightened up . Acamar or Theta Eridani , the Last of the River ' , was included in Ptolemy 's list of first-magnitude stars , but is now below the third ( it is , incidentally , a fine binary ) ; Denebola or Beta Leonis may have dropped from the first magnitude to below the second , while Rasalhague or Alpha Ophiuchi , formerly ranked of the third magnitude , is now of the second . We must beware of placing too much faith in the ancient observations , but the discrepancies deserve to go on record . I may be accused of having spent too much time in discussing variable stars , bearing in mind that I am trying to do // no more than write a basic book . This may be true ; but I plead justification simply because so many amateurs now concentrate upon variable star work . And these stars are fascinating even to non-theorists . They are of so many kinds : the fake ' variables such as Algol , which turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mira stars ; the punctual and highly-reliable Cepheids , and the erratic rebels which we can never predict . Ultimately , theory depends upon observational work , and there is plenty to be done . Much can be learned from studying these strange , unstable suns so many light-years away from us. 14.1 Chapter Eleven EXPLODING STARS THERE WAS A TIME , not so many centuries ago , when the starry sky was regarded as changeless . True , the Moon and planets wander about ; but their movements are predictable , and the stars themselves were thought to show no alterations at all , either in position or in brightness . It is quite correct to say that the constellation patterns are to all intents and purposes unchanging , and that most of the stars shine steadily in light , but now and then what seems to be a new star bursts forth in a position where no conspicuous star has been seen before . Such was the case on 13 December , 1934 , when an English amateur astronomer , J. P. M. Prentice , was taking a nocturnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very peculiar about the area between Draco and Hercules . A new star of about magnitude 31 had appeared , and Prentice realized at once that it must be what is termed a nova . For the next few months it remained visible with the naked eye , though it subsequently faded away and has now become very faint ( Fig. 61 ) . Other nova have been seen , both Prentice 's nova of 1934 before and since . For example , another English amateur , G. E. D. Alcock ? by profession a schoolmaster , teaching in Peterborough ? discovered a particularly interesting nova in the little constellation of Delphinus ( Fig. 62 ) , in July 1967 . This time the magnitude was about 52 , so that the nova was not prominent with the naked eye ; but Alcock had been carrying out a systematic search , using widefield , specially-mounted binoculars , and had spent years in memorizing the position and magnitudes of over thirty // thousand stars , so that he could recognize a newcomer on sight . At once he contacted other observers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those notified , and I was able to identify the nova without any trouble at all , though I would be the last to claim that I would have noticed it unless George Alcock had told me where to look ! The word nova ' is Latin for new ' , but to be accurate a nova is not a new star at all . What happens is that a formerly faint star suffers a tremendous outburst below its outer-most layers . A surface shell ' is ejected at a speed which may be as much as three or four hundred miles per second , and the result is a striking , though temporary , increase in the apparent luminosity , even though . the material sent hurtling outward can not exceed about 1/10,000 of the total mass of the star . Sometimes the shell becomes visible , as happened with a brilliant nova which flared up in 1918 in Aquila . About four months after the outburst the gas-cloud was first seen , and it remained on view for twenty years , though it slowly spread out and became fainter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visibility its diameter had reached something like a million million miles . Naked-eye nova are less uncommon than might be thought , and no less than twenty-two have been seen so far during the present century . The year 1936 was remarkable inasmuch as it produced three ? another nova in Aquila , which reached a maximum magnitude of 5.4 ; one in Lacerta , rising to i ? g , so that for a brief period it outshone the Pole Star ; and a third in Sagittarius , where the peak magnitude was 4.5 . Amateurs , who know the skies so well , have a fine record in nova-detection , and Alcock has now found three . His first success was with Nova Delphini in 1967 ; he followed this up with Nova Vulpeculw in // 1968 , and finally a much fainter star in the little constellation of Scutum , the Shield . ( As he has also discovered four comets , one can not but admire his patience and skill . ) Obviously it is highly desirable to study the spectrum of a nova as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then at its height , and tremendous disturbances are taking place . It is not nearly so easy to study the pre-nova condition , because we can never tell which stars are likely to explode , and there is no warning at all . Still , in some cases pre-outburst spectra are available , and it seems that stars liable to nova outbursts are generally hot sub-dwarfs of spectral type A or thereabouts . There is a strong likelihood that a nova is a star which is coming to the end of its stable career , and is on the way toward collapsing into the White Dwarf condition ; moreover , it has been found that many nova are close binaries ? sometimes , as with Prentice 's star of 1934 ( DQHerculis ) eclipsing binaries . On the other hand , there are difficulties in the way of supposing that every normal star becomes a nova at some time during its evolutionary career . If this were so , we might expect to see far more novae than we actually do . Originally it was thought that a nova might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this attractive idea has been definitely ruled out of court . The stars are so widely separated in space that collisions can hardly ever occur , and nova are much too common to be explained in any such way . If a nova lies in a region where there is a good deal of thinlyspread gas and dust , it will light up the material . This happened with the brilliant nova seen in Perseus in 1901 , and which became as bright as Capella . At first it was thought that the gas-cloud round the star must be expanding rapidly , but this was not really so ; the radiation from the nova was spreading out in all directions and illuminating more and more of the gas and dust , so that the cloud gave the false impression of expanding at the speed of light itself . The cloud is shown in Plate II . Not all nova are alike . Each has its own characteristics , so let us consider two , which were very different in their behaviour . On 7 June , 1918 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had reached the first magnitude . For a short time on 9 June it attained magnitude - 1.4. , the same as // that of Sirius , so that it was 75,000 times as brilliant as it had been only three days earlier . It did not stay bright for long ; by the end of June it was below the third magnitude , and then faded steadily , until by late 1924 it had declined to about magnitude 11 . Examination of earlier photographs of the region showed that it had also been of magnitude 11 before its outburst , so that its spell of glory was brief ( Fig. 63 ) . . Incidentally , it would be wrong to suppose that the explosion really happened in 1918 . The star 's distance is of the order of a thousand light-years , in which case the flare-up dates back well before the Norman Conquest ; we were looking at an event which had taken place in the remote past . Before it turned into a nova , the star was rather more powerful than the Sun ; at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much energy as the Sun . Nova Aquila blazed up before I was born , and I have seen it only in its modern , obscure form , but I have been able to follow the second nova to be described here : HR Delphini ( Fig. 64 ) . This was the star discovered by Alcock on 8 July , 1967 . Unlike Nova Aquilae , it did not become glaringly brilliant , but neither did it fade so quickly . It fluctuated between magnitudes 5 and 4 until around the end of the year , and in December it reached its greatest brightness ? about magnitude 3 . Thereafter it faded ; the magnitude was still 5 on I March , 1968 , 6 in // EXPLODING STARS July , 7 in October and , after a further slowing-down in the decline , about 8 in August . Not until early 1971 did it drop to the ninth magnitude , and at the end of 1973 it was still above magnitude 11 . The light-curve given here , drawn from my own estimates , shows how different was its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , though , that HR Delphini is much the more remote of the two . Its distance seems to be about 30,000 light-years , so that the outburst took place in prehistoric times even though we have only just had the news of it . It is not likely that HR Delphini will ever disappear . Its pre-nova magnitude was 12 , and it was then a very hot star of type O. Probably it will return eventually to its original condition , apparently none the worse for its outburst . The first bright nova which I was able to observe was the famous DQ Herculis of 1934 . The light-curve was exceptional ; after a rather long maximum there was a sudden decrease , followed by a gentle rise before the final fading began ( Fig. 65 ) . Today , as I have said , it is an eclipsing system ; the period is only 4 hours 39 minutes , and in addition the old nova itself seems to be fluctuating quickly over a small magnitude range . The spectrum is made up of a continuous background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large expanding nebulous envelope blown off during the 1934 outburst and partly in a much more compact nebula surrounding the old nova . The companion star has never been seen , but is believed to be an M-type dwarf , while the old nova is probably so dense that it is not unlike a White Dwarf . It is a tremendous pity that we // have no record of the spectrum of DQ Herculis before its flare-up . During its outburst it threw off no less than eleven shells , and at one period , when it was declining , it shone with a decidedly greenish hue . The distance is about 800 light-years , making it the closest of modern bright nova . Another firstmagnitude nova , seen in Puppis in 1942 , was more remote and much more luminous ; at its peak the luminosity was around 1,600,000 times that of the Sun . There has been much discussion as to whether a nova is to be regarded as something apart ' , or merely as a peculiar kind of variable star . We even have a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these is T Corona in the Northern Crown , nicknamed the Blaze Star . In 1855 , Argelander , a German astronomer who compiled a particularly good star-catalogue , recorded it as being of about the tenth magnitude , but in 1866 it suddenly brightened up to the second . It was regarded as an ordinary nova , and faded in the usual way , returning to its pre-outburst magnitude . Then , in 1946 , it put on a repeat performance , again becoming a nakedeye object for a brief period . Now , again , it is back where it started ; I have been observing it over the past decade , and its magnitude has never varied much from a mean value of 1o ? o . Spectroscopic studies have shown that it too is a binary , made up of a highly luminous B-type star , responsible for the nova outbursts , and a Red Giant which is itself irregularly variable over a small range . If T Coronae blazes out every eighty years or so , we must pay close attention to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the advanced age of a hundred and three and will probably be unable to do it justice ! Another recurrent nova ' , RS Ophiuchi , has shown maxima in 1901 , 1933 , 1958 and 1967 , and there are a few more stars of the same class . P Cygni , in the cross of the Swan , is different again , and is not easy to classify . It was recorded as a third-magnitude star in 1600 , and then slowly faded away until it had dropped below naked-eye visibility . In 1654 it reappeared , and after minor fluctuations settled down to the fifth magnitude in 1715 , where it has remained ever since . Spectral studies show that mass is constantly streaming out from its surface , though not with the tremendous velocities encountered in nova explosions ; // it is clearly unstable , and is also very luminous . Other P Cygni type stars are known , though they are uncommon . Even odder is Eta Carina , in the Keel of the Ship . Nowadays it can not be seen with the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 182o it was reasonably conspicuous , and in 1837 and early 1838 it shone more brilliantly than any star in the sky apart from Sirius ; it was still of the first magnitude in 1856 , and it did not vanish from naked-eye view until 1867 . In every way Eta Caring is an exceptional object , and northern observers never cease to bemoan the fact that it never rises above the European horizon . Though P Cygni , Eta Carina and other erratic stars can not be classed with the nova , we must remember that irregular variables such as SS Cygni and U Geminorum show smallerscale , much more frequent outbursts , so that there may be some sort of a link with the recurrent nova at least ? though SS Cygni stars are dwarfs , and the association may not be as close as might be thought , in which case the common term of dwarf novae ' for them may be rather misleading . If our Sun became a nova , life on Earth would be destroyed at once . Fortunately , nothing of the kind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is not the sort of star to suffer an outburst ? though what will happen in the far future , thousands of millions of years hence , we can not tell . Generally speaking , everything in the universe tends to happen with majestic slowness ; but this does not apply to the novae . Developments take place so rapidly that we find it hard to keep pace with them as a formerly obscure star bursts forth , flaring up into a true celestial searchlight , its spectrum changing constantly as it pours energy and material into space . It is a reminder to us that the sky is not static , as the ancients believed , and that at times we can watch phenomena infinitely more dramatic than anything which can ever happen on our tiny Earth . 149 Chapter Twelve SUPERNOVAE ? AND PULSARS IN THE YEAR 1054 , Chinese and Japanese astronomers were surprised to see a brilliant new star in the constellation of Taurus , the Bull . It was so bright that it could be seen even with the Sun above the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . No accurate observations of it were made , and after a while the strange guest star ' was more or less forgotten . Then , in 1572 , there came another outburst of the same kind , in another part of the sky . On 11 November the young Danish stargazer Tycho Brahe , later to become the greatest observer of his time , made a discovery which was to alter not only his life , but also ? to some extent , at least ? the whole history of astronomy . In his own words : " In the evening , after sunset , when , according to my habit , I was contemplating the stars in a clear sky , I noticed that a new and unusual star , surpassing all the other stars in brilliancy , was shining almost directly above my head ; and since I had , almost from boyhood , known all the stars of the heavens perfectly ( there is no great difficulty in attaining that knowledge ) , it was quite evident to me that there had never before been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smallest , to say nothing of a star so conspicuously bright as this . I was so astonished at this sight that I was not ashamed to doubt the trustworthiness of my own eyes . But when I observed that others , too , having this place pointed out to them , could see that there really was a star there , I had no further doubts . A miracle indeed , either the greatest of all that have occurred in the whole range of nature since the beginning of the world , or one certainly that is to be classed with those attested by the Holy Oracles . " Tycho was an extraordinary man . He was proud , grasping and frequently cruel ; he was also a firm believer in astrology , the superstition of the stars ; and he could never bring himself to believe that the Earth could be a planet moving round the Sun . To him , the Earth was the supreme body in the universe . // As the months passed by , and the new star faded , Tycho did not miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be dire : " The star was at first like Venus and Jupiter , giving pleasing effects ; but as it then became like Mars , there will next come a period of wars , seditions , captivity and death of princes , and destruction of cities , together with dryness and fiery meteors in the air , pestilence , and venomous snakes . Lastly , the star became like Saturn , and there will finally come a time of want , death , imprisonment and all sorts of sad things . " Despite his brilliance as an observer , Tycho had no idea of the nature of the star . Neither could he follow it as soon as it sank below the sixth magnitude ; this was before the age of telescopes . Then , in 1604 ? three years after Tycho 's death ? another spectacular new star burst forth , this time in the constellation of Ophiuchus . Johannes Kepler , later to use Tycho 's observations to disprove Tycho 's theory of the universe ( a strange twist of fate ! ) was among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star . It too became , probably , as bright as Venus ; then it too faded away and was lost to view . Since then we have seen no more new stars as striking as these . They were much more dramatic than the ordinary novae discussed in the last chapter . They were in fact supernovae , or stellar deaths . At its peak , a supernovae of the most violent type may shine with a luminosity equal to that of around two hundred million Suns , though clearly it can not maintain this fantastic output for long . Later searches of the old records showed that a star seen in the constellation of Lupus , the Wolf , in 1006 was also a supernova , but the Chinese guest star ' of 1054 is the most important of all so far as modern astronomy is concerned , because we can still see its debris . Near the third-magnitude star Zeta Tauri , not far from the border of Orion , even a small telescope will show a dim , misty patch . Photographs taken with giant telescopes show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make measurements to prove that the whole gas-cloud is expanding , and we know that in addition to sending us visible light it is a source of radio waves , X-rays and gammarays . Officially it is called M.1 , because it was the first entry in Charles Messier 's famous catalogue of nebulae and star-clusters , // having to use a piano which has lost all its notes except those of the middle octave . ( Again the scale is wrong ; an octave includes about one-seventh the number of notes on a normal piano keyboard , but the range of visible light is much less than one-seventh , or even one seven-thousandth , of the whole electromagnetic spectrum . ) A further difficulty is caused by the Earth 's atmosphere , which is irritatingly opaque to most wavelengths coming in from space . Visible light can pass through , of course ? otherwise the sky would be featureless ? but most of the short and longer wavelengths are stopped , as effectively as the beam of a torch will be stopped by a sheet of wood . Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other major gap : the radio window ' . Everything else is cut out . The initial breakthrough was made by accident . In 1931 a young American of Czech descent , Karl Jansky , began some research on behalf of his employers , the Bell Telephone Laboratories . He was briefed to investigate problems of shortwave radio communication , and he was particularly concerned with static ' , the hissing and crackling which bedevils radio contact at short wavelengths . For this purpose he set up a strange-looking radio aerial , which he nicknamed the Merry-goRound ( parts of it were made from a dismantled Ford car ) . He picked up plenty of static , but there was something else too : a weak , steady hiss which appeared to come from the sky . The direction of the source could be estimated , and it moved from day to day . Eventually , Jansky found the answer . The hiss came from the Milky Way ? or , to be more precise , that part of the Milky Way which lies toward the star-clouds in the constellation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the centre of our star-system or Galaxy . Jansky , obviously , was interested . It seemed that he had picked up cosmical radio waves , and he published his work in 1933 , probably expecting that it would cause general excitement . Nothing of the sort happened . His spectacular discovery caused about as much excitement as a piece of cake falling upon damp blotting-paper . Nobody seemed inclined to follow it up ; and neither did Jansky . He produced a few more papers , and then turned his attention to other matters which had nothing to do with the sky . // There the matter rested for some years . An American amateur named Grote Reber built what was certainly the first intentional radio telescope , in 1937 , and began to obtain results of immense significance ; as well as confirming Jansky 's discovery of radio waves from the Sagittarius star-clouds he also found sources in Cygnus , Cassiopeia and elsewhere ? but his work , too , fell upon ears which were if not deaf , at least disinterested . There was even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from brilliant stars such as Sirius or Capella ; they came from apparently blank parts of the sky , which was indeed a most peculiar state of affairs . Then , during the war , British investigators led by J. S. Hey made another discovery which was to some extent fortuitous . It was found that some mysterious radiations were jamming some of our wartime radar equipment , and eventually the source of the trouble was tracked down not to the Nazis , , but to the Sun . At this time the Sun had not long passed the peak of its eleven-year cycle of activity , and solar flares were common enough ? whereas Jansky 's earlier attempts to identify solar radio waves had been unsuccessful , because in the early 1930s , when he was experimenting with his pioneer aerial , the Sun had been quiet ' . Obviously Hey 's reports could not be published at the time , because of military security , but when they were finally released they showed that radio astronomy had an almost limitless potential . Major radio telescopes ' were designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was the Jodrell Bank 250-foot dish , set up in Cheshire almost entirely because of the energy and dedication of Professor ( now Sir Bernard ) Lovell , who has really done for radio astronomy what George Ellery Hale , architect of the Palomar Zoo-inch optical reflector , did for visual astronomy . The term radio telescope ' is somewhat misleading , because an instrument of this sort is not really a telescope at all ; it is in the nature of a wireless aerial , and one can not look through it . It does not produce a visible picture of the object being studied , and all that one normally gets is a trace on a moving roll of paper . The only point of similarity between a radio telescope and an optical telescope is that both collect and focus radiations by using a curved reflector , though of course the radio // telescope has a mirror ' which is of metal rather than glass . Also , let me dispose of the idea that one is listening-in to noise from space . On many occasions solar noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enraged snake ; but in fact the hiss is created inside the receiver , and is only one way of studying the long-wavelength energy coming in from beyond the Earth . Sound-waves can not travel in vacuum , and for this reason alone there is no question that we could ever hear sounds from space . Moreover , not all radio telescopes are of the Jodrell Bank dish type . Many of them consist of long lines of aerials , and look nothing at all like telescopes of any kind . Each design has its own advantages , and its own disadvantages too . One trouble about a radio telescope is that as compared with an optical instrument , it has very low resolving power . The diagram shows what is meant ( Fig. 68 ) . When you have two optical sources ? two stars , if you like ? they can be seen separately . If there are two radio sources , they tend to merge together , because they can not be pinpointed so exactly , and there is bound to be an area of uncertainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one radio source or from several . Things are now much better than they used to be , but in the early days of radio astronomy research the areas of uncertainty were depressingly large . The first success at identification came in 1949 . Australian investigators managed to track down the positions of three radio sources accurately enough to link them with visual objects . Two of these were galaxies , well beyond our Milky // Way system . The third was none other than the Crab Nebula , which became known in radio parlance as Taurus A. If the Crab were a radio source , what about other supernova remnants ? The position of the strong source in Cassiopeia had already been tracked down by Professor Martin Ryle ( now Astronomer Royal ) and F. Smith at Cambridge ; subsequently it was found that there were wispy patches of nebulosity in this position , spreading outward at 4,500 miles per second from an old explosion-centre , and it is now practically certain that a supernova blazed out there about the year 1700 , though we could not see it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . Later came studies of the Cygnus Loop , another gas-cloud which seems to have been produced by a supernova which would have been on view around 65,000 B.C. if only there had been any astronomers on hand to observe it . Other cases are known , and it is now thought that a supernova remnant must necessarily be a source of radio waves . Yet for a long time the mechanism of production of these waves remained a mystery . But for the Crab Nebula , it might well be a mystery still ; but it is time to return to the events leading up to a supernova outburst . Not all stars become supernova ; the Sun will never do so , for instance , because it is not massive enough . Let us go back to the story of stellar evolution . As we have seen , a young star contracts and joins the Main Sequence ( provided that it is massive enough for nuclear reactions to begin inside it ) , and for a long time it shines steadily , or virtually so . Just where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays there , depends upon its initial mass . If it is comparable with the Sun it will build up a core of helium ; when its available hydrogen is exhausted it will become a Red Giant , and different energy-producing processes will take over ; then , when it has reached the end of its resources , it collapses into the White Dwarf condition , finally ending up as a dead globe . It will take a vastly long time to die , and there will be nothing catastrophic about its final extinction . Now suppose that the original star is at least three and a half times more massive than the Sun . All kinds of complicated forces are operating ; and if the helium core becomes too massive , the whole delicate balance of the star is upset . Heavier // and heavier elements are formed , and as the core temperature continues to rise we meet with new complications ; for instance we have to consider neutrinos , which are particles with no mass or electric charge , but which can carry off a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by continually increasing temperature and pressure is that of iron , which is produced when the internal temperature is above 3,000 million degrees . As the star evolves , the temperature at the core soars far above this limit , and at 5,000 million degrees a remarkable thing happens . Instead of building up into still heavier elements , the iron nuclei split up , and the process stops . The iron is converted back into helium ; gravitational forces result in a sudden collapse of the star 's core , and the outer layers , where the earlier nuclear reactions are still going on , are abruptly heated to something like 300 million degrees . ( Remember that the surface temperature of our present-day Sun is a mere 6,000 degrees . ) The result is a supernova outburst . Within a few seconds , the star emits as much energy as the Sun does in millions of years . Material is ejected ? not only a small proportion of the star 's mass , as with an ordinary nova explosion , but a high percentage of it . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud ; the remnant of the original star is composed mainly of neutrons , caused by the running-together of protons and electrons . Massive though it is , a neutron star may be much less than a hundred miles in diameter . Much of this is still speculative , and different authorities have different ideas about what actually happens ; also there are two definite types of supernova , which may not function in precisely the same way . The more luminous ( Type I ) have very little hydrogen in their outer layers , whereas Type II supernova have a good deal . Yet in any case we may be sure that these outbursts are on a scale grander than anything else in Nature , and at least we know more about them than we did a few years ago . Of course , astronomers would welcome the chance to study a supernova outburst from relatively close range ( not too close , however ! ) and we may have the chance at any moment ; by the law of averages we are overdue for a fresh supernova. // Meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxies , and fortunately this can be done . The classic example was that of S Andromeda , which appeared in 1885 in the galaxy Messier 31 , otherwise known as the Great Spiral in Andromeda ? an independent system more than two million light-years away from us . The supernova became just bright enough to be visible with the naked eye , and was discovered around the same time by several observers . I particularly like the case of the Baroness de Podmaniczky , a Hungarian lady who was holding a house-party and had a small portable telescope set up on her lawn for the amusement of her guests . Just for fun , she was looking at the Andromeda Spiral when she announced that it looked rather different from usual . One of the guests , an astronomer who rejoiced in the name of de Kovesligethy , confirmed that there was something peculiar about the Spiral , and notified the authorities . In fact it may well be that the star had been first seen slightly earlier , but I am sure that S Andromeda remains the only supernova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time , nobody could be sure whether or not the star was connected with the Spiral ; this was well before the revelation that spirals are separate galaxies rather than parts of our own system . However , many supernova have since been seen in outer galaxies , and their light-curves have been studied . The outbursts are powerful enough to be seen over vast stretches of space , and if we make the very reasonable assumption that a supernova in an outer galaxy is about as luminous as a supernova in our own Galaxy we can use these colossal explosions to make distance-estimates . A typical supernova in a remote galaxy is shown in Plate III . But of all supernova remnants , the Crab is the most informative , and it contains the only neutron star which we can actually see . This brings us on to the problem of those extraordinary objects known as pulsars . The story of pulsars really began in 1967 , when radio astronomers at Cambridge were carrying out surveys with the help of new equipment . The research team was led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Jocelyn Bell . It was Miss Bell who made the classic discovery . She found a weak radio source which appeared to be // fluctuating very quickly indeed , almost as though it were ticking ' . Originally she took it to be some kind of artificial interference , but further observations showed that it kept to the same position in the sky , in the constellation of Vulpecula ( the Fox ) . What could it be ? The Cambridge team became very interested indeed , and the strange radio source repaid them by vanishing from the records . Then , one day in late November , Miss Bell announced : " It 's back . " At once arrangements were made to study it closely , and the results were quite staggering . The signals came as a regular succession of pulses at an interval of just over one second . They were absolutely regular , and utterly unlike any radio source found before . It is fair to say that the researchers were taken aback . For a while it was even thought that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the or Little Green Men theory was not finally abandoned for some days . An official announcement was postponed until February 1968 ; by then it had become obvious that whatever it might be , the source was natural . A new term , pulsar ' , entered astronomical language , and the hunt was on . By the following autumn nine pulsars have been tracked down from Cambridge , Jodrell Bank and elsewhere , and at the time when I write these words ( December 1973 ) the grand total is over sixty . The quality of the radio pulses showed that the sources were definitely contained in our Galaxy rather than being external . It was also found that though the pulses were regular , they were in general slowing down slightly , at least for most of the pulsars ; and the objects responsible for the transmissions had to be small by cosmical standards , with diameters measured in a few tens of miles rather than thousands or millions . The first sensible theory suggested that they might be White Dwarfs , vibrating rapidly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly enough . Some pulsars send out their signals at a rate of more than four per second ; and even though a White Dwarf is a small star , it is not small enough to behave like that . Indeed , there is one known pulsar with a period of only one-thirtieth of a second . The only type of object which can fit the facts is a neutron star . 16o SUPERNOVIE-AND PULSARS Once again we come back to the Crab Nebula ; where would astronomers be without it ? It was examined anew , and a pulsar was found , vibrating in a period of a mere o ? 03 seconds . Then , in 1969 , astronomers in Arizona found that in the same position as the pulsar there was a faint star , which had previously been identified as the remnant of the 1054 supernova , but had not been seen to be variable . It proved to be flashing ? and its period was o .03 seconds , the same as that of the pulsar . Coincidence could be ruled out . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so far it remains the only case . Of course , the flashing star is extremely faint . It never rises above the fifteenth magnitude , so that large telescopes arc needed to show it . Other workers , using rocket equipment to send their instruments above the inconveniently opaque atmosphere of the Earth , have established that the pulsar is also a source of X-rays . It is tempting to believe that all neutron stars are supernova remnants , and this may well be true ; the fact that we can not see others visually is not significant , because the Crab pulsar ( NP 0532 , to give it its official catalogue number ) is exceptionally close ? a mere 6,000 light-years away , as we have noted ? and only came into existence , as a pulsar , a thousand years ago as reckoned from our vantage point on the Earth . If the others are more remote and are also older , so that some of their initial energy has been used up , we could hardly expect to see them . It is also worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which again indicates its comparative youth . There are many other fascinating pulsars now under surveillance ; Centaurus X-3 , for instance , which is a binary system , and includes an X-ray pulsar . A neutron star must be a weird object by any standards . It may have a diameter of between five and one hundred miles ; there may be a thin solid crust in which sudden disturbances take place , producing starquakes ' which show up by sudden alterations in the pulsars ' periods . According to some calculations , the density at the centre of a neutron star is such that a cubic inch of it would weigh over four thousand million tons . Compared with this , even White Dwarf material is flimsy . So far as the pulsations are concerned , the current theory is that a neutron star has a very strong magnetic field , and is also rotating // GUIDE TO THE STARS quickly . The magnetic pole is not coincident with the pole of rotation , and the result is that there is a kind of searchlight beam ' effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a radio pulse . In fact , the pulses are produced not because the neutron star is vibrating , but because it is spinning round with amazing speed ? thirty times every second in the case of the Crab pulsar . Whether these ideas are valid or not we can not yet be sure , but few astronomers now doubt that pulsars are neutron stars , representing the end products of supernova outbursts . This alone is a major step forward . Even though pulsars have been known for less than a decade , we have at least a reasonable understanding of them . Unquestionably they provided one of the main astronomical talking-points of the 1960s. 162 Chapter Thirteen BLACK HOLES IT MIGHT WELL be thought that neutron stars must represent the ultimate in celestial oddities . Yet this may not be so . During the past year or two much has been heard of what we call Black Holes ? and if they really exist , they are stranger still . I have given them a separate chapter because I am acutely conscious that what I propose to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months . All I can do is to present the theories which are being so widely discussed at the present time . According to the laws of physics , at least as we usually interpret them , a star with more than about ten times the mass of the Sun could never become a White Dwarf or an ordinary neutron star . During the abrupt shrinking , gravitation takes over , and the material is crushed together until the escape velocity becomes greater than the velocity of light ( a concept which was , incidentally , discussed by the French astronomer Laplace as long ago as 1798 ) . This means that the object is cut off from the rest of the universe , because not even light can get away from it . We have a very small , super-dense object ? sometimes called a collapsar , from collapsed star ' ? surrounded by a kind of forbidden zone which makes up the black hole . The boundary of this forbidden zone is termed the event horizon . It has even been suggested that the original body may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still exert a gravitational pull on other bodies , so that it will be detectable , but obviously it can not be seen . It was in 1971 that the idea of black holes really came to the fore . This time it was not the Crab Nebula which provided the impetus , but an ordinary-looking star called Epsilon Auriga ; , close to the brilliant Capella . I have already referred to the three Kids ' which make up a naked-eye triangle . One , Eta Aurigae , is quite ordinary ; the second , Sadatoni or Zeta Auriga , is an eclipsing binary with a period of 972 days . Epsilon Aurigae is even more remarkable . // The variations in light are quite noticeable , and were discovered by an astronomer named Fritsch as long ago as 1821 . Normally , the star shines with a magnitude of 3 ( slightly brighter than Megrez , the faintest of the seven stars in the Great Bear pattern ) , and the bright component , which sends us virtually all the light from the system , is definitely a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 6o,000 times that of the Sun . The diameter has been given as 150 million miles , though I would hesitate to suggest that this figure is very accurate . The mass is 35 times that of the Sun , which by stellar standards is very high indeed . The secondary component can not be seen directly , because its surface is so cool that it radiates only in the infra-red . Generally , the only spectral lines seen are those of the primary , though during an eclipse some extra dark lines appear . An eclipse occurs every 27.1 years , or , more accurately , 9,898.5 days . The bright component is gradually covered by the invisible secondary , and the magnitude drops to just below 4 . A complete eclipse lasts for over 700 days , and during the central 330 days the light remains steady at its minimum value . This , of course , provides a means of measuring the diameter of the secondary , and astronomers worked out that it must be of the order of 2,000 million miles ? that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planets in our Solar System out to beyond Uranus . It would be the largest star known , with a calculated mass of 23 times that of the Sun . Presumably we were dealing with a very young star , still contracting toward the Main Sequence and not yet hot enough at its core for nuclear reactions to begin , whereas the primary had already passed through its Main Sequence stage and had passed into the giant branch to the upper right in the H-R Diagram . This idea was challenged by two American astronomers , A. G. W. Cameron and R. Stothers , who suggested that instead of being young , the invisible secondary must be very old . This alters the whole picture . If the primary has already evolved off the Main Sequence ( as seems definite ) it is assumed that the secondary did so even earlier , and suffered an implosion ' , turning into a collapsar surrounded by a black hole . In this case , the infra-red radiation which we receive from Epsilon Aurigae is due to a cloud of solid particles moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand million miles from the centre of the black hole . Over the course of time , many of these particles will spiral inward and enter the black hole , so that they too will disappear from our ken . Remember , nothing that is swallowed up by a black hole can ever emerge again . It is a fascinating picture . By no means all astronomers accept it , but in any case Epsilon Aurige is an exceptional system , innocent though it looks . Another suspect ' is to be found in Cygnus . Here we have a supergiant star , HDE 226868 , which has a mass about 30 times that of the Sun . It is certainly a binary , but the companion has never been seen , and is thought to have a diameter of only about sixty miles ? and yet its mass is fifteen times as great as the Sun 's . X-rays come from the system , and if these are due to the secondary they can be explained by supposing that the material falling in toward the black hole is accelerated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into heat . Cygnus X-1 , as it is called , has been carefully studied of late , and more and more authorities are becoming disposed to accept the black hole idea . With its high mass , the density of the collapsar might not be so great as that of a neutron star ( in passing , if the Sun were to produce a black hole its diameter would have to be reduced to about 3 miles ) . Yet agreement is not complete . According to an alternative theory , there is no collapsar and no black hole in the Cygnus X-i system , but merely two stars whose very powerful magnetic fields become entwined as the stars spin round ; the magnetic lines of force are periodically broken and then reconnect , with the release of energy and the production of X-rays . Nothing in modern astronomy seems to have caught hold of people 's imagination as strongly as the black hole concept . With great diffidence , I suggest that there have been some rather wild speculations , and that there is a real need for caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a huge black hole near the centre of our Galaxy , which will eventually swallow up every star and every planet ; that spacetravellers of the future , journeying between the stars , will have to be very careful to avoid falling into a black hole whose event horizon can not , of course , be seen ; and that it might be // possible not only to utilize the power of black holes , but even to create them on a miniature scale , with potentially disastrous results . One particularly strange suggestion was that the socalled Siberian Meteorite of 1908 was nothing more nor less than a tiny black hole which hit the Earth , causing local devastation , and then passed right through the globe , emerging on the far side and continuing blithely on its way ! Then , too , there have been speculations about what would happen to an astronaut unwise enough to pass over an event horizon into a black hole . If he could survive the conditions there ( such as super-violent tidal forces ) it has been claimed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a completely different universe . Also , can a black hole reappear suddenly in another area as a white hole ' ? Quite obviously , we have entered the realm of science fiction , and despite all these bizarre ideas we must not forget that up to now we have no certain proof that black holes exist at all . It is certainly premature to suppose that they are common , and contain an appreciable part of the mass of the entire universe . There may be a completely different explanation , and at the moment it is best to adopt a policy of Wait and see ' . Meantime , we may at least be confident that our Sun will not become either a pulsar or a black hole . It will end its brilliant career much less spectacularly , as a White Dwarf , and it will not change markedly for several thousands of millions of years yet . But it is intriguing to note how astronomy has developed ; there is more than a casual connection between Tycho Brahe 's supernova of 1572 and the pulsars and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTO THE eastern sky during any clear evening in early autumn , and you will see what appears to be a patch of shining haze . Look more closely , and you will see that the patch is really made up of stars , crowded so close together that they seem to be almost touching . If the sky is dark enough , anyone with normal eyesight should be able to make out seven individual stars in the group , and binoculars will reveal many more . The group is known officially as M.45 or the Pleiades cluster , though the popular name for it is the Seven Sisters . The cluster is very easy to locate . It lies in Taurus , the Bull , some way from the bright red star Aldebaran . The diagram on the next page shows its shape , though in fact the Sisters are so noticeable that they can hardly be mistaken . There has never been much doubt that the cluster is a real one , and is not due to accidental lining-up of stars at different distances from us . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses " sat at the helm and never slept , keeping his eyes upon the Pleiads " . All the ancient astronomers , such as Ptolemy , described them , and there are various legends , about them . One version tells us that the Sisters were seven nymphs , who were strolling placidly through a forest when they were pursued by the hunter Orion . Orion was attracted by their beauty , and it is reasonable to assume that his intentions were anything but honourable ; but just as he was about to overtake them , the King of Olympus changed them into doves and transferred them to the safety of the sky . ( Orion 's views about this episode are not on record . ) The brightest member of the cluster is Alcyone , which is of the third magnitude . Next in order of brilliance come Electra , Atlas , Merope , Maia and Taygete , while Pleione , Asterope and Cel2eno are on the fringe of naked-eye visibility ; Pleione , the interesting shell star ' described earlier , is however very close to Atlas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69 ) . There have been suggestions that one of the Pleiades stars has faded 167 since ancient times , but I rather doubt this , though it is true that Pleione is somewhat variable . Some years ago I conducted a survey in The Sky at Night programme on BBC Television , and found that the average number of stars seen individually really is be held by Eduard Heis , a last-century German astronomer , who totalled nineteen ; but Terence Moseley , an amateur astronomer who lives in Armagh , has seen fifteen . Let me add , however , that this is exceptional . My own score has never exceeded a modest eight . In the mid-19th century Johann Madler , a German astronomer who will always be remembered as the first man to draw a really good map of the Moon , commented that the stars in the Pleiades did not show any motions relative to each other , and went on to propose that Alcyone might be the central star in the Galaxy , with all other stars ( including the Sun ) revolving round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt because of Madler 's excellent reputation , but it was quite unfounded . The Pleiades represent a particularly good example of an open or loose cluster ? in this case a group of hot white stars embedded in very thin gas . There are over three hundred of them all told , contained in an area about fifty light-years in diameter . The distance from Earth is only just over 400 light-years , which explains why the cluster is so conspicuous . The best view of the Pleiades is obtained with binoculars . Use a telescope , and the field will be too small to show the whole cluster at once , so that much of the beauty will be lost . There is little doubt that the stars in the Pleiades have a common origin , and were formed in the same way at about the X68 CLUSTERS OF STARS same time fairly recently on the cosmical time-scale , because the leaders are very luminous stars of spectral type B , and have not yet had time to evolve off the Main Sequence . A loose cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually be disrupted by the gravitational pulls of other stars , so that it will lose its identity . The late Walter Baade , who was responsible for a complete revision of our estimates of the size of the universe , once wrote that the Pleiades cluster could not persist , as a cluster , for more than about a thousand million years in the future . Open clusters are by no means uncommon , and several others are visible with the naked eye . In particular , note the Hyades , also in Taurus . They lie round the brilliant K-type star Aldebaran , and are just as easy to find as the Pleiades , though they are not so striking . They are decidedly overpowered by the strong orange light of Aldebaran , and in some ways this is a pity , since Aldebaran itself is not a true member of the cluster at all . Here we have a genuine line-of-sight effect ; Aldebaran lies roughly half-way between the cluster and ourselves . When you look at the rather V-shaped form of the Hyades , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are from Aldebaran . The stars in the Hyades are relatively scattered , and the cluster is of different type from the Pleiades . The leaders are , in the main , Red Giants , and the very brilliant B-type stars characteristic of the Pleiades are absent , so that evidently the cluster is older . The proper motions of the Hyades stars can be measured , and an interesting fact emerges . All of them seem to be converging toward a point in the sky about five degrees to the east of Betelgeux . Here we have a perspective effect ; the stars are not really closing in on each other , but are moving through space in paths which are more or less parallel . Aldebaran , on the other hand , is moving almost at right angles , so that in the distant future it will no longer masquerade as a member of the cluster . Because the Hyades are apparently converging ? and are , incidentally , receding from us ? they will eventually give the impression of a smaller , more compact group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappreciable to the naked eye even over vast periods of time . // Another famous northern-hemisphere cluster is Praesepe in Cancer , popularly known as the Beehive or the Manger . Cancer itself is in the Zodiac , but it is decidedly obscure , and contains no stars much brighter than the fourth magnitude ; it looks not unlike a very dim and ghostly Orion , but it is easy to find , because it lies between the Twins , Castor and Pollux , to one side and the Sickle of Leo on the other . ( Here too we have a legend , according to which Cancer was a sea-crab which attacked the hero Hercules as he was battling with a particularly peevish monster . Hercules not unnaturally trod on it , but domestic quarrels among the Olympians led to its being transferred to the sky . ) Praesepe lies near the middle of the constellation , flanked by two dim stars which are known as the Aselli or Asses : Delta Cancri ( magnitude 4 ) and Gamma ( 5 ) . The cluster is an easy naked-eye object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading stars are of mid- or late-spectral type , so that Praesepe is more closely related to the Hyades than to the Pleiades ; it is fairly old , and seems to contain no nebulosity at all . The best way to view it is to use a very low magnification and a very wide-field eyepiece on your telescope . Praesepe was the 44th object in Messier 's catalogue . In the same constellation there is another famous open cluster , M.67 , which is easy to see with binoculars near the inconspicuous // star Acubens or Alpha Cancri ( Fig. 70 ) . It is a long way from the main plane of the Galaxy , and contains 500 members ; it is also very remote ? its distance from us is over 2,500 light-years , as against less than 600 light-years for Praesepe . The main point of interest , from the theoretical point of view , is that it is thought to be one of the very oldest of all open clusters , with an age of the order of 5,000 million years ; it has avoided disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great French astronomer Camille Flammarion commented that it looked " like a sheaf of corn " , which is by no means a bad description of it . Even more beautiful telescopically are the twin clusters in Perseus , marking the sword-handle , easily found by using two of the stars in the W of Cassiopeia as pointers . The twins are in the same low-power telescopic field , and are true neighbours ( Plate IV ) . The distance is thought to be 7,000 light-years , and the clusters may not be much more than a million years old . It is a great pity that they are so far away . Were they closer to us , they would provide a spectacle beside which the Pleiades would pale into insignificance . Another striking cluster is to be found round Kappa Crucis , in the Southern Cross ? unfortunately never visible from Europe . It has been nicknamed the Jewel Box , because it contains stars of various colours . A small telescope will show it , and it really does come up to expectations . It would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many open clusters which can be seen with modest instruments ; I have given details elsewhere . Incidentally , it is ironical that when Charles Messier drew up his famous catalogue , he was not really concerned with clusters or nebulae at all . He was a comet-hunter , and found that he was wasting time in checking upon faint , hazy patches which looked very like telescopic comets ; so he catalogued them as objects to avoid ' . It is ironical that while we still use the M-numbers , almost everyone has forgotten about his comet discoveries . For some reason or other Messier did not include the twin clusters in Perseus , and of course the southern objects such as the Jewel Box never rise above the horizon in France , where he carried out all his observational work . Much later , toward the end of the nineteenth century , J. L. E. Dreyer drew up a New General // Catalogue of clusters and nebulae , containing many more objects than Messier saw , and the N.G.C. numbers are now used in preference . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have stellar associations or moving clusters ' , which do not show up as compact groups . The best example is the Plough . Of the seven famous stars , five are moving through space in the same direction at the same rate , as we have already noted , so that they will keep the same relative positions for a very long time , and a few more stars belong to the same group . Generally speaking , a stellar association is defined as a number of stars of similar type and motion in the same region of the Galaxy ; there is , for instance , an association made up of a very spread-out group of 0 and B stars in the area of Scorpio and Centaurus , and there is another round the highly luminous Zeta Persei . Here we have over fifteen hot stars , moving in a way which suggests expansion from a definite centre ; the rate of expansion is about 8 miles per second , and it has been calculated that the expansion began about 1,300,000 years ago . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars in the association ? which is hardly surprising , since all show 0 or B-type spectra , and must be young stars squandering their energy at a furious rate . Associations of this kind are particularly important because they can tell us a great deal about the ages and past careers of the member stars . Astronomers all over the world are busily studying them ; special mention should be made of the pioneer work carried out in the Soviet Union by V. A. Ambartsumian . Let us now turn from the stellar associations , which are scattered so widely that they can not be recognized on sight , to the globular clusters , which are as different as they can be . The two most spectacular examples lie in the far south of the sky , and can never be seen from Europe . One is Omega Centauri , not so very far from the Southern Cross ; the other is 47 Tucanae in the rather dim constellation of the Toucan . Each is visible to the naked eye , and in a telescope each is showed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the centre . In the northern hemisphere , the brightest globular cluster is M.13 Herculis . It is just visible without optical aid on a clear night , but is none too easy to find unless its position is known // accurately , particularly as Hercules itself is rather ill-defined . The cluster lies between Zeta and Eta Herculis , rather closer to Eta . If you can not see it with the naked eye , the best course is to use a low power on your telescope and sweep from Zeta toward Eta ; you should then find the cluster without much trouble , and , incidentally , it is obvious in binoculars . With a moderate telescope it is a fine sight , and many individual stars can be seen in its outer portions . It has been known for a long time ; Edmond Halley , of comet fame , discovered it as long ago as 1714 . Globular clusters are comparatively rare . Only just over a hundred are known in our Galaxy , and the full total may not be more than about twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even Omega Centauri is not really striking with the naked eye . This is not because they are really dim , but because they are very remote . Omega Centauri , which is admittedly rather above the average , has a total luminosity of perhaps a million Suns , and lies at a distance of 22,000 light-years ; M.13 Herculis is somewhat further away . Plate V shows another splendid globular , M.5 in Serpens , at 27,000 light-years from us . The distribution of the globulars is rather unexpected . They are not spread uniformly around the sky , and most of them are in the south ; there is a well-marked concentration toward Scorpio and Sagittarius . As we will see later , this apparently lop-sided distribution is due to the fact that the Sun lies well away from the centre of the Galaxy instead of being near the middle , as Herschel had believed . Their distances have been measured by making use of some of the convenient variable stars which provide us with information simply by the way in which they fluctuate . Most globulars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M.13 Herculis contains very few . The most powerful stars in globular clusters are red supergiants , and it follows that the systems are relatively old . They make up a sort of outer framework ' to the Galaxy , and Omega Centauri is actually the closest of them . The central crowding is real , and near the middle of a globular the average distance between individual stars is much less than in our own part of the Galaxy . The actual distances are still great , and collisions can hardly ever occur , but any // one star is almost bound to have several more within a couple of light-years of it . Moreover , many of these will be very luminous . Suppose that we could take a trip to a planet moving round one of the stars near the middle of Omega Centauri or M.13 ? What sort of a sky would we see , and would it be very unfamiliar to our eyes ? The answer is a resounding yes ' . On our imaginary planet , the scene will be magnificent . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; probably at least thirty will shine more brilliantly than Venus does to us , and it is quite on the cards that several will rival our Moon , so that instead of appearing as twinkling points they will show real disks . There is also a strong chance that they will be red , since ? as we have seen ? the red supergiants predominate . There can be no true night ' on such a world . The glare of the stars will give much more light than our full moon , and darkness will be unknown . If we go a step further , and suppose that the planet is inhabited by a race of beings who share our own interest in the universe , we can see that certain difficulties will have to be faced . Admittedly , the close stars will be well displayed , but fainter objects will be drowned in the general glare , so that it will be a hopeless task to try to study anything outside the cluster . The proper motions of the stars will be more marked than with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths round the centre of gravity of the system , and even over comparatively short periods these shifts will be noticeable . No constellation will keep its outlines permanently , and star-maps will have to be re-drawn completely every few centuries . Moreover , the apparent magnitudes of the stars will change . A red supergiant which passes within , say , a light-year of our imaginary planet will dominate the night sky ; as it passes its point of closest approach and begins to recede once more , its disk will shrink and its glare will dwindle into a soft glow . There is also the fact that supergiants tend to be unstable and to vary in luminosity , so that magnitude changes would be caused in this way as well . No narrow-minded astronomer living in a globular cluster would be able to maintain that the skies are unchanging , as our own philosophers believed only a few centuries ago . It is interesting to speculate as to the theories which might be // held by cluster-dwellers . Probably they would believe their own system to be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being very limited in size . They might have shrewd suspicions that other systems could lie beyond their local globular , but proof would be very hard to obtain . Of course , we have no idea whether there are any inhabited planets inside globular clusters , but there seems no obvious reason why not . Each globular contains many tens of thousands of stars , and no doubt some of these are very like our Sun , though from our own vantage-point we can see only the highly luminous leaders . We can see , then , that there are associations and groups of all kinds , from the spread-out moving clusters to the open clusters such as the Pleiades , the more complicated systems of the Perseus sword-handle type , and the wonderful starry spheres which we call globular clusters . There is endless variety in the stellar universe . 175 Chapter Fifteen NEBULIE WHENEVER THE SKY iS dark and clear , and Orion is above the horizon , the unmistakable pattern of its bright stars catches the eye at once . Quite apart from the eminence of Betelgeux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close by the Belt there is the Hunter 's Sword , which looks rather like a faint patch of luminous fog . Moonlight drowns it , but under good conditions it is easily visible without a telescope , and any pair of binoculars will show it well . It is the most famous of those objects which we call galactic or gaseous nebula , and it has been known ever since 161o , when it was described by an otherwise totally obscure astronomer named Nicholas Peiresc . The word nebula ' is Latin for cloud ' , and the term is by no means inappropriate . ( Certainly it is better than many others we find in astronomy ; for instance there are no seas on the Moon , and no canals on Mars . ) Even a modest telescope will show details in the Sword of Orion . In its midst there is the famous multiple star Theta Orionis , the gas and making it shine . There is much truth in this , though we know now that it is only part of the story . As we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his famous list published in 1781 . Not all of them were gaseous nebulae . Many were star-clusters , and there were also some patches which seemed to be resolvable into stars . Of these , the most famous was the 31st object in his catalogue ? the Andromeda Nebula , which had been recorded in the tenth century by the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi and which is dimly visible with the naked eye ( though , for some unexplained reason , it was totally overlooked by the usually eagle-eyed Tycho Brahe ) . Increased telescopic power showed that there were two definite classes of nebulae , the irresolvable ? such as the Sword of Orion ? and the resolvable or starry . Using instruments which were much the powerful of their time , William Herschel set out to catalogue the various nebu-176 NE BU LIE lous objects , and in 1786 he published a catalogue of more than a thousand of them . He mentioned " nebulosity of a milky kind " near Theta Orionis , and in 1789 he described it as " an unformed fiery mist ; the chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark . Later , he said that this self-luminous material " seemed more fit to produce a star by its condensation , than to depend on the star for its existence " . Evidently he had more than a suspicion that the gaseous nebulae might be stellar birthplaces ; and he also speculated as to whether the resolvable nebulae might be separate systems , far beyond our own . We now know that this idea was correct , even though it fell into disfavour for many decades after Herschel 's death in 1822 . M.31 in Andromeda is not a nebula ; it is a galaxy , and the same applies to the other resolvable patches , though not all of them are spiral in the same way as M.31 . Nowadays the term spiral nebula ' has been dropped . When referring to a nebula , we mean a cloud of dust and gas . The first definite proof that irresolvable nebulae are gaseous came on 29 August , 1864 , with some brilliant work by the pioneer spectroscopist Sir William Huggins . When Huggins looked at the spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of showing a rainbow band crossed by dark lines there were bright emission lines only ? and not many even of these . This was proof that the nebula must be composed of shining gas . ( To be accurate , Huggins ' object was a planetary nebula , which is really a star surrounded by a huge gaseous shell and is quite different from the Sword of Orion ; but the same principles apply . ) Let us look more carefully at the Orion Nebula , M.42 ( or , if you like , N.G.C.1976 ) . Its distance from us is about 1,500 light-years , and it is extremely large . The diameter is of the order of 25 to 30 light-years ( Fig. 70 ) . This means that it could cover the distance between ourselves and the bright blue star Vega . Yet the density is incredibly low , and corresponds to what we normally call a laboratory vacuum . I am reminded of a comment made to me quite recently by Dr. David Allen , of the Royal Greenwich Observatory . If you could bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would collect would weigh no more than one new penny ! // There is plenty of dust in the Orion Nebula , and this makes stars inside it seem redder than they would otherwise be ? because the shorter-wavelength blue light bounces off the dust-grains and is scattered . Some years ago , E. Becklin found an infra-red source in the nebula ; it could not be seen visually , and was assumed to be a very young star which was still contracting toward the Main Sequence . More recently , work by Allen and his colleagues seems to show that Becklin 's Star is in fact immensely luminous , but is hidden by the dust between it and ourselves . Other nebula may well contain stars of the same kind . M.42 has a bright-line spectrum , as was first shown by the tireless Huggins in 1888 , and this means that it is self-luminous to some extent . The stars inside it are extremely hot , with spectra of type 0 and B , and it is the ultra-violet radiation sent out by them which excites the nebular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is , // for instance , the nebulosity in the Pleiades cluster , which is not at all easy to see visually though it is spectacular when photographed . The stars inside it are not so hot as those in the Sword of Orion , and so they can not make the gas shine on its own account . It is true to say that it is the gas which shines , and the dust which absorbs the light of stars inside the nebula . Hydrogen is much the most plentiful substance in the universe , and so it is not surprising to find that galactic nebulae consist largely of it . There are other elements as well ? oxygen , neon , nitrogen and argon , for instance ? but hydrogen is dominant . Incidentally , there are also some spectral lines which caused a great deal of excitement when first discovered , because they could not be identified ; it was thought that they must be due to a completely new element , which was named nebulium . There was an interesting precedent , since helium had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had not been tracked down on Earth until a quarter of a century later . Nebulium remained a mystery until 1927 , but then I. S. Bowen , in America , showed that it was due to nothing more fundamental than common elements ( mainly oxygen and nitrogen ) in unfamiliar states . This was something of an anti-climax , and nebulium , as an element , was rather sadly deleted from the records . There can be no doubt at all that fresh stars are being formed inside galactic nebula , and much of our information has been drawn from M.42 ? not because it is unusual , but because it is so bright and easy to study . I have already mentioned FU Orionis , the very young star which was caught in the act of blowing away its dust-cloud and brightening up by several magnitudes . Moreover , the nebula contains over two hundred irregular variables which are still in the pre-Main Sequence stage . The first of them , AF Orionis , was found as long ago as 1848 , but nowadays the stars are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class . There is also some fascinating work carried out some time ago by the American astronomers Blaauw and Morgan . Their attention was drawn to a faint 0-type star , AE Aurigae , which seems to have an exceptionally high velocity of something like 8o miles per second . It seems dim only because it is so far off , and on the stellar scale it is both energetic and young . If we // trace its path backwards , we find that about two and a half million years ago it must have been in the region of the Orion Nebula . In almost exactly the opposite direction there is another 0-type star , Mu Columbae , which has a similar velocity and is about the same distance from the nebula , but is moving the other way . It has been suggested that some colossal disturbance took place two and a half million years ago , hurling AE Auriglae and Mu Columbae violently outward . To this may be added a third star , 53 Arietis ; the agreement is not so good , but lies within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three stars were once near neighbours ? perhaps in that stage in their careers when they were still , broadly speaking , being formed ? and that some outburst sent them on their different ways , so that by now they are so far apart that as seen from Earth one lies in Columba , one in Auriga and one in Aries ? It is at least possible . Now let us turn to T Tauri , and what I call " The Case of the Vanishing Nebula " . The nebula itself lies near the Hyades , and was first noticed in 1852 by John Russell Hind , an observer who was particularly interested in minor planets and was searching for them with the help of a 7-inch refractor . He described it as " a very small , nebulous-looking object " close to a tenth-magnitude star . T Tauri , the star concerned , was a variable , but Hind was in no position to realize that there was anything peculiar about it . The nebula was duly listed , and seemed to be perfectly normal , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement that it had almost disappeared . Very large telescopes still showed traces of it , but by 1868 it had completely gone . Hind 's nebula was officially classed as missing ' , but other developments were taking place nearby . In 1868 Otto Struve found nebulosity round a 14th-magnitude star close to T Tauri , and d'Arrest , who had previously looked carefully at the area , was certain that the nebulosity was new . It was recorded at various times until 1877 , but then it too disappeared as completely as the hunter of the Snark . Then , in 189o , Barnard and Burnham , using the 36-inch refractor at the Lick Observatory , rediscovered Hind 's old nebula . It was visible , but a mere ghost of its former self , and was a difficult object even with this powerful telescope . Late in 18o NEBULZE 1895 it vanished again , to reappear once more later on . Nowadays it is easily visible with large instruments , but its form is not the same as when Hind first reported it . Of course , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is N.G.C.1555 . Moreover , T Tauri itself is embedded in nebulosity ? and this nebulosity too is variable . And as an extra puzzle , it was found that Hind 's nebula yields emission lines , though T Tauri is a dwarf star not nearly hot enough to excite nebular gas to luminosity . The nebula is much more variable than the star , and it was suggested that changes in illumination could be largely responsible , so that whereas in Hind 's day the gas was lit up by T Tauri some other material moved in around 1860 and cast what could be regarded as a shadow . T Tauri is an infra-red source . Careful studies of it have been carried out in the infra-red by Martin Cohen during the past few years , and when he correlated his observations with my own visual observations of the star 's fluctuations he found that there was a definite connection . There can no longer be any doubt that T Tauri and its kind are veritable infants on the time-scale of the universe . Hind 's object is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , associated with R Monocerotis , in the Orion area , and R Corona Australis in the southern hemisphere of the sky . Unfortunately all these nebulae are so faint that they can be studied only by means of photographs taken with large telescopes . There are plenty of gaseous nebula within the range of a moderate telescope . Look for instance at M.8 , the Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius , which is very remote ( nearly 5,000 lightyears from us ) and is of the emission type ; it is also a radio source , and contains a large number of T Tauri variables . Also in Sagittarius there is M.17 , the Omega or Horse-shoe Nebula , which contains both bright filaments and dark obscuring material . Southern observers have the Keyhole Nebula , which surrounds the extraordinary variable Eta Carina and is much larger and more massive than the Sword of Orion , though it is also much further away from us . I have said that nebulae associated with very hot early-type stars become self-luminous ( H.II regions , to use the technical term ) while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 181  | by reflection only . It may be added that some bright nebule , notably M.42 , represent only parts of much larger areas of nebulosity . But suppose that there are no convenient stars to provide illumination ? Presumably the nebula will remain dark ? and this is exactly what we find . A dark nebula betrays itself because it cuts out the light of stars beyond , just as a cloud of smoke will hide a distant street-lamp , and the outlines of the nebula will be traceable . For once Herschel made a mistake here ; it is said that on coming across one of these patches during a sky-sweep , he explained " This surely , is a hole in the heavens ! " Yet there is no chance of stars being absent in one particular direction , and there is no doubt that shielding nebulosity is the answer . The best-known of these dark nebulae , the Coal Sack in the Southern Cross , is Reflected light never visible from Europe . It blots out an area of sky 8 Star are similar nebule near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic difference between a bright nebula and W V V a dark one ? and , moreover , B much depends upon the From A , the dust cloud angle of observation .

Near DUST CLOUD ? the star Rho Ophiuchi , bright and dark nebulae are seen side by side , giving a wonderful effect and there  | bright ; from point B it would be dark . By various indirect methods , distance-estimates can be made . The Coal Sack proves to be around 400 light-years away , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the centre of a cloud of this size , familiar stars such as Alpha Centauri , Procyon , Sirius and Altair would also be inside it . Different again are the so-called planetary nebule , which , as I have said , are neither planets nor nebula in the true sense of the term . The most famous of them is M.57 , the Ring Nebula in Lyra , which : Vega was discovered in 1779 by an astronomer named Darquier who was using a telesco only aperture . It is Pe of oabout 3 inches easy to locate , since it lies directly between y M Beta and Gamma Lyre , close to the Fig. 73 . Position of brilliant Vega ( Fig. 73 ) . Beta is the eele- the Ring Nebula M. brated eclipsing binary , while Gamma is 57 , the most famous a normal star of the third magnitude . of theplanetaries.It lies between Beta Look between them , using a modest Lyrie ( the famous telescope , and you will make out a dim eclipsing binary ) patch . Increased power will show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike a tiny shining so that it is easy to bicycle-tyre . The name planetary nebula ' locate , though in a small telescope it is is due to Herschel , who once thought it faint . possible that the objects might be planetary systems circling other stars ? though it was not long before he realized that this could not be the case . The Ring Nebula is made up of a central star of below the twelfth magnitude , surrounded by a spherical gaseous shell . When we look at it , we see more glowing matter at the edge than at the centre , so that we have the impression of a luminous ring . The overall diameter is rather less than one light-year , but other planetaries are larger . N.G.C.7293 in Aquarius is roughly twice the size of the Ring Nebula ; if the Earth lay on one side of a planetary of this diameter , the opposite edge would extend well out toward Alpha Centauri . Yet the planetaries are not nearly so massive as might be thought ? because they are so rarefied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around a giant vacuum-flask five  | miles in diameter , the resulting density would be roughly the same as that of the gas in an average planetary nebula . About five hundred planetaries are known , but most of them are very faint and far-away ; even the Ring lies at over 1,400 light-years from us . Not all are symmetrical . The Dumbbell Nebula in Vulpecula , M.27 , is one of the finest examples . It was first seen in 1764 by the indefatigable Messier , and has a central 12th-magnitude star with a featureless rainbow spectrum ; it really does look like a dumb-bell when seen with a telescope of sufficient power . Then we have the Owl Nebula , M.97 , in the Great Bear , not far from Merak , the fainter of the two Pointers to the Pole Star . This time we have two bright , smooth condensations symmetrically placed to either side of the central star . The Owl is large for a planetary , but is not an easy object ? which is hardly surprising , since its distance is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at is H.IV.I ? not catalogued by Messier ? which lies in the same low-power field as the orange star Nu Aquarii . In very large telescopes it shows strange extensions which remind one a little of Saturn 's ring system , though , needless to say , there is no real analogy . All planetaries are expanding . Their average age is thought to be about 20,000 years ; as the material spreads out it becomes fainter , and it has been estimated that after ioo , 000 years or so the shell will become too faint to be seen at all . The central stars have high surface temperatures of 50,000 degrees or so , and are well advanced in their life-stories , since they have completed their main nuclear burning and are on the way to becoming White Dwarfs . For instance , the explosion which produced the Dumb-bell Nebula is thought to have occurred between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago . Whether all stars of normal type become planetary nebulae for a time is a matter for debate . We have learned a great deal since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his searches for comets . His catalogue was a grand medley of gaseous nebulae , galaxies , clusters and planetaries , to say nothing of the very first entry of all , the stellar wreck M.1 ? the Crab , which has told us so much . But of all these , it is perhaps the ordinary gas and dust clouds which hold the greatest fascination for us , for it is here that new stars are being created . Thousands of millions of years ago , our Sun was born in the same way .  | THERE CAN BE few people who have not admired the beauty of the Milky Way , which stretches right across the sky from horizon to horizon . Ptolemy , in his Almagest , wrote that " The Milky Way is not a circle , but a zone , which is almost everywhere as white as milk , and this has given it the name it bears . Now , this zone is neither equal nor regular everywhere , but varies as much in width as in shade of colour , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the diversity of positions ; and also because that in some places it is divided into two branches , as is easy to see if we examine it with a little attention . " Ptolemy 's account dates back nearly two thousand years , but as a description of the Milky Way as seen with the naked eye it could hardly be bettered . Starting in Cassiopeia , we can follow it through Perseus , Auriga and Gemini , past Procyon and Sirius down to the southern horizon as seen from England ; it then crosses the Ship , the Southern Cross and Centaurus , and thence into Scorpio and Sagittarius , Aquila , Cygnus and back to Cassiopeia . The section between Carina and Sagittarius never rises above the European horizon , and this is unfortunate , since it is particularly rich ; in Crux , too , we have the celebrated Coal Sack . However , the most brilliant part of the whole Milky Way is in Sagittarius . This at least is within range of European observers , though it is always rather low down ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Milky Way must have been known from very early times ? after all , it can hardly be overlooked ! ? and various theories were put forward to explain it , some more logical than others . The Greek philosopher Parmenides of Elea , who lived toward the end of the sixth century B.C. held that " it is the mixture of the dense and the rarefied which produces the colour of the Milky Way " . ( To do him justice , he also claimed that the stars must be made of what he called " compressed fire " , so at least he regarded them as self-luminous . ) Anaxagoras of Clazomenx , born about 500 B.C. , believed that " the Milky  | Way is the light of certain stars . For , when the Sun is passing below the Earth , some of the stars are not within its vision . Such stars , then , as are embraced in its view are not seen to give light , for they are overpowered by the rays of the Sun ; such of the stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are not seen by the Sun , form , by their own proper light , the Milky Way . " This may sound rather involved , but I can assure you that it makes sense when you have read it through several times . Anaxagoras , of course , believed the Earth to be flat , and to him the Sun was a large red-hot stone . Yet he did think the Milky Way to be made up of stars , rather than a shining fluid . When Galileo first began to use the telescope for looking at the sky , in the winter of 16og-lo , he found that the Milky Way " is nothing else than a mass of innumerable stars planted together in clusters . Upon whichever part of it you direct the telescope , straightway a vast crowd of stars presents itself to view ; many of them are tolerably large and extremely bright , but the number of smaller ones is quite beyond determination . " Here again we have an account which might have been written by any modern astronomer . The greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see ; but even a small instrument will show so many of them that to count them would be absolutely impossible . And at first sight , it might well be thought that the stars in the Milky Way are so crowded together that they can hardly avoid bumping into each other . As so often happens in astronomy , appearances are deceptive . There is no real crowding ; all we are seeing is a line of sight effect . Once again we come back to the work of Sir William Herschel , who was the first man to put forward a really scientifically-based explanation of the arrangement of the stars in our system . Herschel knew that he had no hope of counting all the stars , so he decided to confine his main work to certain selected regions of the sky . This was the famous method of star-gauging , and it worked well . His final conclusions were not entirely accurate , but at least he was on the right track , and his work was based upon logical research rather than guesswork or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herschel believed ? wrongly ? that the apparent brightness of a star must be a reliable guide to its distance from us , so that brilliant stars such as Sirius and Canopus would be closer than fainter ones such as Polaris . This sounds plausible , but we now know that the stars have so wide a range in luminosity that the principle does not hold good ; as we have noted , Canopus , for instance , is a real searchlight seen from an immense distance . Herschel , of course , had no means of checking , because in his day star-distances were still unmeasured . If he had been right , it would follow that the regions of the sky which contained the most stars represented the greatest extensions of the stellar system ? and this was where the star-gauging method came in . Obviously , there are more stars in and near the Milky Way than in other parts of the sky , but Herschel soon found that the percentage increase was greater for faint stars . For instance , suppose that we take two telescopes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them to study a selected area near the Milky Way , as well as another region in a barren part of the sky . The small telescope will show only fairly bright stars , and it will be found that the rich region will contain about four times as many stars , area for area , as the barren one . With the large instrument , which will show fainter stars as well , the ratio is bound to be much higher : probably about ten to one . In other words , faint stars are more numerous near the Milky Way than might be expected . Herschel decided that the stellar system or Galaxy must be shaped rather like what he called " a cloven grindstone " or double-convex lens . This would explain the Milky Way effect easily enough . The diagram ( Fig. 74 ) will show what is meant , though , to be honest , it is not drawn quite to Herschel 's pattern . If the Sun ( S ) lies near the middle of the system , many stars will be seen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the luminous band ; fewer stars will be seen in the directions of C and D. This was as far as Herschel could go , and the next real step was taken in 1904 by a Dutch astronomer , Jacobus Kapteyn , who showed that the proper motions of the stars are not entirely random ; there is a tendency for a general drift in two special directions . Since all proper motions are tiny , the effects of this star-streaming are very slight , but Kapteyn  | The idea of the Galaxy as a system shaped like a double-convex lens , with the Sun near the middle . This is not exactly as Herschel pictured it , but it gives the general idea . knew that the phenomenon must be real . Accordingly he decided to attack the problem of star distribution rather along the lines laid down by Herschel , but unlike his great predecessor he did not have to do all the work himself . Observatories all over the world co-operated in examining over two hundred regions for star counts , and from the results Kapteyn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again the Sun , with the Earth and other members of the Solar System , was thought to be rather close to the centre of the system . The idea of a centrally-placed Sun was not unreasonable . A fly sitting on the hub of a bicycle-wheel will be able to see the rim both above , below , and to the right and left ; similarly the Milky Way makes up a complete band in the sky . True , it is richer in some parts than in others , but this could well be coincidence . The key to the whole problem was eventually provided by the globular clusters ; the man responsible was the great American astronomer Harlow Shapley , whose death only a few years ago was so sad a blow to his many friends ( including myself ) . We have already met the globular clusters , which are truly magnificent objects . Unfortunately there are not many which are really well seen from Europe , and the two brightest , Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae , are so far south that they never rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Shapley realized that the grouping was too marked to be sheer chance . Over a hundred globulars are known , and most of them lie to the south , particularly toward Scorpio and Sagittarius . This is not to say that the northern hemisphere has  | no globulars at all ; remember M.13 in Hercules , for instance , which is a bright system . We also have some others , such as M.92 , also in Hercules , and M.3 in Canes Venatici , the Hunting Dogs ( not far from the Great Bear ) . All the same , Shapley was impressed by this lop-sided distribution . There had to be some explanation for it . Shapley realized that the globulars found a kind of outer surround to the main Galaxy , and that they lie on the fringes of the system , which is why all of them are a long way away from us . At that stage their distances had not been measured , but luckily the RR Lyres variables came to the rescue . To recapitulate for a moment : the RR Lyres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . Their fluctuations are regular , and all of them seem to have about the same luminosity , somewhat less than a hundred times that of the Sun . As soon as we can measure their apparent magnitudes , then , we can find their distances ? allowing for various complications such as inter-stellar absorption , of course . This is what Shapley did with the RR Lyre variables in the globular clusters , and for the first time he could work out not only their distances but also their sizes . The mystery was solved at once . The Sun lies well away from the centre of the Galaxy , and so we have a lop-sided view . This is where Herschel had been wrong . Now we can draw up a better picture . There is a central nucleus , lying in the direction of the Sagittarius star-clouds , and the Galaxy has the flattened shape shown in Figure 75 ; it measures about ioo , 000 light-years from side to side , with the Diagram of the shape of the Galaxy .  | Sun lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus is around 2o,000 light-years . Surrounding the main system is the galactic halo , including the globular clusters and many isolated stars . Nowadays we know the position of the centre of the Galaxy , but we can not see it , because there is too much dust ' in the way . And this brings us on to the general question of interstellar material , which has become so remarkably interesting during the past year or two . The story really began in 1904 , with some spectroscopic work by an astronomer named Hartmann . He was looking at the spectrum of Delta Orionis , the faintest of the three stars in the Hunter 's Belt , which is a spectroscopic binary , so that its absorption lines show the characteristic to-and-fro displacement due to Doppler effects . Hartmann found that one line , produced by calcium , did not share in this movement , but remained obstinately in the same position . Clearly , then , it could not be a line due to the binary system itself , and could only be due to material lying between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found , and there is also direct proof of the presence of interstellar matter ; I have already discussed the strong reddening of some remote stars . Not unexpectedly , the absorption of light is most marked near the main plane of the Galaxy . It was also the presence of interstellar material ? hydrogen gas , in this case ? which led to proof positive that if our Galaxy could be seen from above ' ( or below ) it would take the form of a spiral system . This had long been suspected , partly because of the way in which the bright stars are arranged in the sky and partly because many other galaxies are spirals ( including M.31 in Andromeda ) , but it is not at all easy to decide upon the shape of a system when one is living inside it . During the war , H. C. van de Hulst and his colleagues in Holland worked out that for reasons which need not concern us at the moment , the clouds of cold hydrogen in the Galaxy ought to send out radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1951 Ewen and Purcell , in America , showed that this really does happen . It became possible to plot the positions and the movements of the hydrogen clouds , and a strong indication of spiral structure was found . We now know that the Sun lies not far  | from the edge of a spiral arm . I will have more to say about this sort of thing when dealing with outer galaxies . Hydrogen is by no means the only material spread between the stars , and all sorts of unexpected things have been found recently ? water vapour , for instance , and organic molecules . It shows that there is no such thing as truly empty space ' , and the significance of these new discoveries is only just starting to be appreciated . So far as the dust is concerned , the grains are extremely small ? of the order of a hundred-thousandth of a centimetre in diameter ? and it has been found that they are affected by the well-marked magnetic field of the Galaxy , which also is of tremendous importance to theorists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two so-called stellar populations ' . It seems that there is a definite difference between the kinds of objects to be found in and near the spiral arms of the Galaxy , and in the region of the nucleus . In the arms , the brightest stars are very hot and of early spectral type ( 0 and B ) ; there is considerable interstellar material . This makes up what we call Population I. In Population II areas , the most luminous stars are old Red Giants which have evolved off the Main Sequence , and the interstellar matter has been more or less used up , so that presumably star formation has to all intents and purposes ceased . This is the situation near the middle of the Galaxy , and also in the globular clusters . Virtually all the objects in the galactic halo seem to be of Population II ? though we must be rather wary ; the distinction is not always absolutely clear-cut . Not surprisingly , it has been found that the Galaxy is rotating round its nucleus . Here again there are complications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the Sun takes about 225 million years to complete one circuit , a period which is sometimes known unofficially as the cosmic year ' . The velocity is of the order of 150 miles per second . Stars closer to the nucleus have shorter revolution periods ; those further out take longer . Objects in the galactic halo have different kinds of paths , and because they do not move in orbits similar to that of the Sun they seem to be very fast-moving ? even though they do not really travel with exceptional speed . They are known as high-velocity stars , and are of Population II . The length of the cosmic year is so great that nobody can  | really appreciate it . One cosmic year ago , the Earth was passing through the coal-forest or Carboniferous period ; there were no true trees , and the so-called forests were made up of tall plants of the horsetail variety . There were no men , no mammals and only small reptiles ; even the great dinosaurs lay in the future ? though there were amphibians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are back in the Cambrian period , when the continents were completely barren and life was represented only by small , low-type sea creatures . Three cosmic years takes us into the Pre-Cambrian , before life on Earth began . In fact , the whole story of living things on our world is contained in the last three cosmic years . What will happen to us during the next cosmic year remains to be seen , and may well depend upon our own actions in the immediate future ! Meantime , we are at least in a position to look at the various objects in our Galaxy and decide upon how they are arranged . If we could look at the system from outside , we would be able to see the spiral form . We have found , too , that our Galaxy is not unique ? and this leads us on to a consideration of the universe itself .  | HUMAN VANITY HAS suffered a number of hammer-blows during the past few centuries . First it was clearly shown that the Earth is an unimportant planet rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun was relegated to the status of a dwarf star in our Galaxy . And then , in our own time , we have found that even the Galaxy itself is insignificant in the universe as a whole . As a system of stars , it is probably rather on the large side ; but there is nothing at all exceptional about it . Sir William Herschel had the glimmerings of the truth when he wrote that the starry or resolvable nebulae might be " no less than whole sidereal systems " which might " outvie our Milky Way in grandeur " . He could not be certain , and never really made up his mind . This was not his fault ; in his day the distances of the stars had not been measured , and nobody had any reliable idea of the true scale of the universe . In 1845 a giant telescope was built at Birr Castle , in Ireland , by a most remarkable astronomer ? the third Earl of Rosse . Quite unaided , except by workmen from his estate whom he trained as technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far larger than anything previously built ( Herschel 's largest mirror was a mere 49 inches in diameter ) . It was cumbersome and awkward to use , but it was certainly effective , and it was put to good use. * Lord Rosse turned it toward one of the resolvable nebuhe ' , M.51 , which lies in Canes Venatici , not far from the Great Bear . To his amazement , he was confronted with the picture of a whirlpool of light ? a true spiral , unlike anything which had been seen before . Other spirals were soon found , and by 185o the list had grown to fourteen , though for many years only the Birr reflector was able to show them ; other telescopes were not powerful enough . Nowadays , vast numbers of spiral systems are known , though let me hasten to * I have told the whole remarkable story elsewhere : The Astronomers of Birr Castle ( Mitchell Beazley , 1972 ) . The episode remains unique . Nothing like it has ever happened before in the history of science , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not all the objects once called starry or resolvable nebula are spiral in shape . Naturally , spirals are seen at all sorts of angles . M.31 , the Andromeda system , is not favourably placed ; we are looking at it almost edge-on , so that the whirlpool effect is largely lost . If we had a face-on view of it , as with M.51 , it would be much more spectacular . By the end of the nineteenth century the difference between the gaseous and the starry nebulous objects was very clear indeed ? but with the spirals and their kind , were we looking at features lying inside our Galaxy , or at external systems ? On the whole , opinion had swung away from Herschel 's guess , and in a famous history of astronomy written in 1902 by Agnes M. Clerke we find the theory described as " a half-forgotten speculation . . . it becomes impossible to resist the conclusion that both nebular and stellar systems are part of a single scheme " . Obviously , the spirals were so remote that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very hard to solve without those convenient variable stars which give away their real luminosities simply by their periods of fluctuation . The original clue was provided by the variables in the southern Small Magellanic Cloud . I have already said something about it ? see Chapter 10 ? but I hope you will forgive a certain amount of repetition , because the whole subject is so vitally important . The two Magellanic Clouds are , alas , too far south to be seen from anywhere in Europe , but they are very familiar indeed to Australians , New Zealanders and South Africans ( Plate VII ) , because they are easily visible with the naked eye . They could easily be mistaken for detached parts of the Milky Way , and telescopes show that they contain all manner of objects , including variable stars and gaseous nebula . Around the beginning of the present century , thousands of photographs of them were taken from Arequipa in Peru , where a large telescope had been set up by astronomers based at Harvard in the United States . When Henrietta Leavitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts emerged . Over 1750 variables were found , many of which were Cepheids . Miss Leavitt established that the Cepheids in the Small Cloud which looked  | the brightest had the longest periods ; since , for all practical purposes , all the stars in the Cloud could be regarded as lying at the same distance from us , the longer-period stars were genuinely the more luminous . This led on to the famous Cepheid period-luminosity law . It was not long after this that Harlow Shapley studied the short-period variables in the globular clusters , and drew up the first reliable maps of the Galaxy . Actually , the stars used by Shapley were not classical Cepheids , but the variables which were once called clusterCepheids and are now known as RR Lyrae stars . The difference seemed to be unimportant at the time , though it proved to be of tremendous significance later on . What could be done for the globular clusters could presumably be done also for the resolvable nebule , and this would settle the age-old question of whether or not they were external systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stated in a famous debate with another great astronomer , Heber D. Curtis , in 1920 . Yet on this occasion Shapley was wrong . Three years later there came the most far-reaching discovery of all , made by Edwin Hubble with the aid of the zoo-inch reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson ? then much the most powerful in the world ( it was not surpassed until the completion of the Palomar 2oo-inch , after the end of the last war ) . Hubble detected Cepheids in the Andromeda Spiral , worked out their distances , and announced that they must be something like 750,000 light-years away . This would put them well outside the Milky Way system ; and it followed that the Andromeda Spiral must be a galaxy in its own right . I doubt whether it is possible to over-emphasize the importance of this discovery . It changed all Man 's ideas about the universe ; the last illusions of grandeur were shattered at a stroke ' , to use a modern phrase . Before long it was found that Hubble 's original estimate was too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , it appeared that the Andromeda Galaxy was much smaller than ours , and it was generally believed that the Milky Way system must be a sort of super-galaxy ; yet there were uneasy doubts . Something might still be badly wrong . The next step was taken in 1952 by the late Walter Baade ,  | this time using the Palomar reflector . ( It had to be this great telescope ; no other instrument had sufficient light-grasp . ) The method of attack was highly ingenious . First , Baade made a systematic search for RR Lyra variables in the Andromeda Spiral , and failed to find any . This was surprising ; though RR Lyres stars are less luminous than Cepheids , they are still very powerful , and at a distance of less than a million light-years they ought to have shown up . Therefore , either they were absent from the Spiral ? which did not seem likely ? or else the Spiral itself must be so far away that they could not be seen . Finally , Baade found the answer . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Type I variable is more luminous than a Type II star of the same period . The Cepheids in the Andromeda Spiral had been regarded as belonging to Type II , but in fact they were of Type I , so that all the distance-estimates had to be doubled . The modern estimate for the Andromeda Galaxy is 2,200,000 light-years . I well remember the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society at which this result was announced . It caused a sensation , to put it mildly . There had been an error of around one hundred per cent ; the universe was twice as large as had been thought ? since , of course , the error applied to all the galaxies , not only to M.31 . Also , M.31 itself proved to be larger than the Milky Way system rather than smaller . Fittingly , the two Magellanic Clouds provided extra proof . They contain globular clusters , but up to then there had been a curious anomaly ; though similar in form to our own globulars , those in the Clouds had been thought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves were further away there would be no problem . The modern value for their distance is 180,000 light-years . Both systems are genuinely smaller than our Galaxy ; the Large Cloud is about 40,000 light-years in diameter and the Small Cloud 20,000 , as against 1oo,000 lightyears for the Milky Way system . Both Clouds are more or less irregular in shape ; the distance between their centres is 75,000 light-years , and radio studies have shown that they are contained in a common envelope of very rarefied hydrogen . It has been suggested , though without real conviction , that the Clouds are satellite galaxies of our own system . In any case , they are much the closest of the main external systems , and  | they can be studied in great detail , so that they are of unique importance to theorists . In fact , this is one reason why really large telescopes are being set up in the southern hemisphere . The Andromeda Spiral , too , has companion galaxies , one of which ( M.32 ) was listed by Messier ; but unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be predominately Population II , so that their brightest stars are reddish . Hot Main Sequence stars of high luminosity are scarce , though there are plenty of them in the Spiral itself . The Andromeda Spiral is the most distant object clearly visible with the naked eye . ( A famous trick question is : How far can you see without optical aid ? ' The answer is-2.2 million light-years , or roughly **26;0;TOOLONG miles ! ) Unfortunately it is not spectacular when seen through a modest telescope , and this also applies to the other galaxies . To study them properly , one has to make use of photographs taken with very powerful instruments , and telescopes of the size owned by most amateur astronomers will not show the spiral forms at all . Look at M.31 by all means , but do not be disappointed to find that it seems only like a smudge of light . Not far from it in the sky is another spiral , M.33 in the constellation of Triangulum ( Plate VIII ) , which is seen more or less face-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being smaller and fainter . Some people claim to have glimpsed it with the naked eye ; I have never been able to do so , but it can be identified with binoculars . The central condensation is much less marked than with M.31 . The Milky Way system , the Andromeda and Triangulum Spirals , and the Magellanic Clouds are very close on the distance-scale of the universe , and are contained in what we call the Local Group of galaxies ( Fig. 76 ) . There are more than two dozen other systems in the Group , but these are relatively small and loose ; for instance , the two dwarf systems seen in Sculptor and Fornax respectively make up a total of only about one per cent of the mass of our Galaxy . However , we must remember that we can not see all the way through the galactic nucleus , because of the obscuring material in the way ? and there may well be other systems beyond permanently hidden from us . There have been suspicions that two objects in Perseus , known as Maffei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The Local Group : the two Magellanic Clouds ( LMC , SMC ) and the Andromeda and Triangulum Spirals ( M.31 , M.33 ) . Distances are in light-years. may be massive galaxies in the Local Group ; but nobody really knows , because they are too heavily obscured to be properly classified . Though Cepheids are so luminous , they can not be seen individually beyond distances of a few million light-years , and so we must look for some other method of distance-measuring . Supergiant stars can be pressed into service . They outshine even the Cepheids , and it seems reasonable to assume that the supergiants in an external galaxy are about equal to those in our own Galaxy ? so that we can work out how far away they must be merely by measuring their apparent magnitudes and making the usual corrections . The results are probably fairly reliable , though less so than for the Cepheids , and the method can take us out well beyond the Local Group . Within the range of the supergiant method we come to a whole group of galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand members , and for most practical purposes these galaxies can be taken to be at the same distance from us . They appear fairly close together in the sky , but this , of course , is misleading ; and do not forget that what we call a cluster of galaxies is very different from a star-cluster , either loose or globular . The Virgo cluster lies at around 40 million light-years from us , and there are systems of all kinds , including spirals . We can calculate the real sizes of these galaxies , and apply the same principles as with the Cepheids and the supergiants , suitably modified . Measure the apparent size of a still more remote galaxy , compare this with what should be its true size ? and its distance follows . Again we have a reduction in accuracy , because even if two galaxies are similar in form they are not necessarily equal in diameter , but the method is better than nothing at all , and it can carry our space soundings ' out to over two thousand million light-years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supernova : occur in other galaxies beside our own ; if we assume an average maximum luminosity for a supernova , we can estimate its distance . Generally speaking , the average distance between galaxies seems to be several million light-years , but it is important to bear in mind that except in our own part of the universe we can see only the brighter systems . If the Magellanic Clouds , for instance , lay at 500 million light-years instead of less than 200,000 , we would have no hope of seeing them at all , though a major galaxy would still be on view . The tendency toward clustering is so marked that many astronomers believe the true picture to be one of vast arrays of groups , with genuinely isolated galaxies being rare exceptions . With really remote clusters of galaxies ? such as that in Hercules ( Plate IX ) , or Hydra , at over 2,000 million light-years ? no structure can be seen ; the systems appear only as fuzzy patches on our photographic plates , and it takes an effort of imagination to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars together with clusters , nebulae and , almost certainly , planetary systems as well . This is as far as purely optical methods can take us , and to estimate distances which are still greater we have to turn to the  | spectroscope . As so often happens , we come back to our reliable ally , the Doppler effect . In 1920 V. M. Slipher , at the Flagstaff Observatory in Arizona , examined over four hundred galaxies spectroscopically , and made a curious discovery . Red Shifts were not only the rule , but almost the invariable rule . Nearly all the galaxies were running away from us at high speeds ( remember that a Red Shift indicates a velocity of recession ) . At that time it was still uncertain whether or not the starry nebulae ' were external systems , but on all counts the Red Shifts were very much of a problem . When Hubble had managed to show that the spirals and their kind were true galaxies , he turned his attention to the Red Shifts . Of course , the spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come from a single body , but is the result of the spectra of all kinds of objects jumbled together , so that the main lines only can be made out . However , the Doppler effect shows up unmistakably , and what Hubble found made the situation even stranger . There was a definite relationship between Red Shift and distance ; the more remote galaxies were receding the faster , and the speeds were fantastic , amounting to thousands of miles per second . Only the systems in our Local Group were exempt . It appeared that every cluster of galaxies must be receding from every other cluster ; in other words , the universe is expanding . Let us suppose that the distance/velocity relationship ( the Hubble Constant ' ) is valid out to as far as we can see . We then have a new method of distance-gauging . Look at the spectrum ; measure the Red Shift ; work out the velocity of recession ? and you have the distance . This , in essence , is how the distances of very far-away galaxies are measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 5,000 million light-years off . If the Red Shifts are not pure Doppler effects , then we are obviously in serious trouble ; but this a point to which I will return later on . For the moment , let us turn back to the varied forms and characteristics of individual galaxies . Spirals are of various kinds , from loosely-wound forms to tight ' Catherine-wheels ( Plate X ) . Hubble originally divided them into three types ? Sa , Sb and Sc , as shown in Figure 77 . In Sa galaxies , as with M.65 in Leo ? at a distance of 29 million light-years ? the central condensation is large , with the arms  | tightly coiled . Sb systems have arms which are more prominent ; to this class belongs M.64 , nicknamed the Black-Eye Galaxy ' in Coma Berenices , near the Great Bear . Here the distance is 44 million light-years , but M.64 is larger than most of its companions in the Virgo cluster , and is an easy object in a small telescope ? though do not expect to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , we have the Whirlpool ' M.51 and also the Triangulum Spiral , M.33 . Today we also recognize galaxies of type SO , which have been described as spiral systems without any true spiral arms . A good example is M.84 , again in the Virgo cluster . Then , too , we have the Seyfert galaxies , first noted by Carl Seyfert in 1940 , where the nuclei are almost starlike . One of these is M.77 , in Cetus , which is over 50 million light-years away and has the distinction of being the senior galaxy of Messier 's catalogue . Its total mass has been estimated at 800,000 million times that of the Sun ; and like other Seyferts it is a strong source of radio waves . SO caption In addition there are the extraordinary barred spirals ( SBa , SBb , SBc ) in which the arms seem to extend not from a true nucleus , but from the ends of a straight bar lying in the plane of the system and passing through its centre . These galaxies are less common than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same , there are plenty of them . Dwarf irregular galaxies are numerous enough ; the junior  | members of the Local Group belong to this class , and are made up chiefly of Population II . Large irregulars are rare , but there are many systems which are elliptical ; here we have sub-grades ranging from E7 ( very flattened ) down to Eo ( spherical ) . Again Population II predominates . Probably the most famous of the giant elliptical systems is M.87 ( Plate XI ) , yet again belonging to the Virgo Cluster and lying at 41 million light-years from us . It is of type Eo , and from it issues a curious jet ' which looks very much as though it were formed by material being ejected at a high speed . M.87 is almost the equal of the Seyfert galaxy M.77 in mass , but it has another characteristic too ; it sends out about ten thousand times as much energy at radio wavelengths than it might be expected to do ? and this brings me on to the whole question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio sources identified in the early days of this new branch of astronomy were extragalactic . One of these was Cygnus A , in the Swan , which was soon tracked down to a faint optical object ; improved equipment showed that there were two radio sources lying to either side of the faint visible patch , and it was only in late 1973 that R. J. Peckham , at Manchester , managed to track down much weaker radio signals from the optical object itself . The distance was estimated at 700 million light-years , and it was found that the gas-clouds in the source were moving around at something like 300 miles per second , so that clearly tremendous activity was going on . Even more surprising was the southern Centaurus A , at a much lesser distance ( 12 million light-years ) , which when photographed with large telescopes looked very curious indeed , and gave every impression of being compound . Some explanation had to be found , and for a few years it was thought that we were observing cosmical collisions on a grand scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom hit each other , because they are so widely spaced ; but the tenuous material between the stars would be colliding all the time , and would , it was believed , account for the radio emission . Around 196o the idea of colliding galaxies was so deeply-rooted that to question it was almost heretical . Then , as so often happens , new calculations showed that the whole  | concept would have to be thrown overboard . The amount of energy being sent out is so great that mere collisions of interstellar atoms and molecules will not explain it . The trouble is that up to now , at least , no really satisfactory alternative has been put forward , but that tremendous disturbances are taking place there can be no doubt at all . For instance , there is the case of M.82 in Ursa Major , which has been described as an exploding galaxy , and is known to have a powerful magnetic field . In 1961 C. R. Lynds , in America , was studying the larger Sb-type spiral M.81 , which is fairly close ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that a second , weaker radio source , which had been assumed to be associated with this spiral , actually came from its fainter neighbour M.82 , which is genuinely irregular ? as had been noted with the great 72-inch Rosse reflector as long ago as 1871 . Clearly there was something unusual about it , and R. Sandage used the Palomar reflector to show that there were huge , intricate structures of hydrogen gas , moving about at speeds of up to 600 miles per second . It now seems that a colossal outburst took place near the centre of M.82 in the past . From the present movement of the gas , we can fix the date reasonably well ; it corresponds to about 12 million years ago ? though since the galaxy is 81 million lightyears from us , the actual date of the explosion goes back a full ten million years . There are not many hot bluish stars in M.82 , and it is generally believed that the radio waves are due to what is known as synchrotron emission ? that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong magnetic field . Incidentally , M.82 is small as galaxies go . Apart from M.32 , the elliptical companion of the Andromeda Spiral , it is actually the least massive of all the galaxies in Messier 's list . It would be idle to claim that we yet know a great deal about the evolution of galaxies , and we are not even sure how or why spiral arms form ? though it has been shown , at long last , that a spiral rotates with its arms trailing ' , again in the manner of a Catherine-wheel . Elliptical galaxies are mainly of Population II , and so are older than spirals with their hot Population I stars ; but it would be very rash to assume that a spiral evolves into an elliptical . There is much that we do not know ,  | and it may even be that in the near future we will have to revise our ideas almost as drastically as astronomers had to do in 1923 , when Hubble first showed that the spiral nebula ' are huge systems far beyond our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that even if we did not know all about the objects in the stellar sky we did at least know all the types of objects which were there . We have been sadly disillusioned . Pulsars came upon the scene before the end of the decade , but even before that there had been the discovery of the remarkable and puzzling quasars ' . The story really began with some attempts by astronomers at Palomar to identify a number of small , reasonably intense radio sources which had been listed in the third catalogue drawn up at Cambridge , in England . R. Minkowski , one of the Palomar observers , had been particularly interested in the problem , and had scored a notable success with one of the sources , 3C-295 ( that is to say , the 295th object in the Cambridge list ) . Originally there had been no known object in the position of the radio source , which lies in Bootes , but Minkowski took special photographs with the zoo-inch reflector and tracked the emissions down . In the precise position of the radio source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strongly red-shifted that the distance was obviously very great . In fact 3C-295 , at some 5,000 million light-years , turned out to be the most remote object ever identified up to that time . Encouraged , Minkowski turned his attention to three other sources : 3C 48 , 196 and 286 . This time he had no luck at all . There were no visible galaxies , but in each case there seemed to be a faint blue star in the approximate position of the radio source . With 3C-48 , the sixteenth-magnitude star was accompanied by a wisp of nebulosity . The star seemed to be rather out of the ordinary ; definite lines were found in its spectrum , but nobody could identify them . Early in 1963 the problem was attacked by Maarten Schmidt , also at Palomar . He concentrated upon the source known as 3C-273 , because he knew its exact position in the sky . Normally , it is not easy to pinpoint a radio source as accurately as can be done for a star ; but it so happens that  | 3C-273 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened three times in the previous year , so that very accurate measurements had been possible . When the Moon passes in front of a star , and hides or occults it , the star 's light seems to snap out like a candle-flame in the wind . The disappearance is virtually instantaneous , because the Moon has no atmosphere , and a star is to all intents and purposes a point source . Occultations have been used to check the position of the Moon , because the stars have been plotted on the celestial sphere with amazing precision ? and if you know the moment when the star 's light is cut off , you also know where the Moon 's edge is at that moment . With a radio source , the situation is reversed , because this time it is the position of the Moon 's limb which is known with the greater accuracy . Also , a radio source is generally of appreciable size , so that it disappears gradually as the Moon sweeps across it . Predictions for 3C-273 enabled C. Hazard and his colleagues at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out just where the radio source lay . In fact , they discovered that there were two sources , separated by about 20 seconds of arc . Using the positions measured at Parkes , Schmidt found that one of them coincided with a star slightly brighter than the thirteenth magnitude , while the more extended source could be identified with a fainter wisp or jet of bluish nebulosity . The next step was to study the optical spectrum of the brighter source . There was no real difficulty about this ? a star of magnitude 131S bright enough to yield an excellent spectrum ? but at first Schmidt was baffled . There were six visible dark lines and three broader emission regions , superimposed on a background continuous spectrum which was very bright in the blue region . But what about the identification of the lines ? They did not seem to fit in with anything at all . Then , one evening , Schmidt decided to see whether he could identify the lines if he applied a correction for a Doppler shift to either the blue or the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tremendous shock . All six lines could be identified ( four with hydrogen , one with oxygen and one with magnesium ) if he were prepared to admit a 16 per cent shift of the red , which would mean a tremendous velocity of  | recession ? and , therefore , a vast distance . Once the clue had been found , the spectrum of 3C-48 was examined in the same way , with the same result . Again there was a huge Red Shift . Again the main lines could be confidently identified as being due to hydrogen . If these results were reliable ? and of this there seemed little doubt ? then 3C-273 , 3C-48 and other similar objects could not be stars , and they could not be members of our Galaxy . Since they were so unexpected , nobody had a name ready for them ; at first they were called QSOs ( a conventional abbreviation for Quasi-Stellar Objects ) , but by now they have become known as quasars . This is more comprehensive , and also more appropriate , since it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio waves . As soon as these startling facts became widely known , the great Quasar Hunt began . Dozens were found ; by now the list runs into hundreds , and we can not question the reality of the optical identifications . We know what quasars look like , and we also know that some of them are variable , particularly in the radio range ( 3C-273 , for instance , fluctuated to the extent of 30 per cent in two years ) . What we have not so far been able to discover is an answer to the all-important question : What are they ? Assuming that the Red Shifts in their spectra are Doppler effects , as with galaxies , all quasars are not only very remote but are also super-luminous . A powerful quasar may outshine a complete galaxy of the Milky Way type ? and , remember , a galaxy may contain more than a hundred thousand million stars . Yet a quasar looks more or less stellar , so that compared with a galaxy it is extremely small . Its diameter can not be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out how so much energy can come from so diminutive an object . At first glance the situation makes no sense at all , and neither do the velocities of recession . A quasar thousands of millions of light-years from us , well beyond the 5,000 million light-years of the radio galaxy 3C-295 , measured by Minkowski , may be racing away at a velocity not so very far short of that of light . Let me make one point clear immediately . There are some astronomers who doubt whether the Red Shifts are pure Doppler effects , in which case the quasars would be neither so  | remote nor so powerful as has been generally thought ; but even so , they must still lie well beyond our Galaxy , and they must be highly luminous . In passing , they show no measurable proper motions , and they could not be expected to do so . In a way it is misleading to say that they were discovered ' in 1962 ? 3 ; they had been known long before , and some of them were recorded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been taken for ordinary stars ( as can be seen from Plate XII ) . There was no reason to suspect otherwise ? until radio astronomy entered the field . A few nights ago I turned the 15-inch reflector in my own observatory toward 3C-293 . It looked remarkably innocent and stellar , and had I not been able to identify it , from its position on my charts , I would have had not the slightest chance of realizing that there could be anything unusual about it . We seem to be faced with an energy-source which is new to us , and about which we know regrettably little . So first let us try to decide whether the colossal luminosities and distances indicated by the spectroscopic evidence are genuine or not . If they are not , then at least the quasars will become slightly less incredible . It is no use trying to deny the Red Shifts themselves ; the spectral lines are perfectly clear . We know that Doppler effects can produce shifts of this kind . There can also be redshift effects due to gravitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , very dense , relatively nearby White Dwarfs such as the companion of Sirius . It would be convenient to say simply that the Red Shifts in quasars are gravitational , but Schmidt and his colleague J. Greenstein have shown that the very strong gravitational fields needed would prevent the emission of some of the characteristic spectral lines that we can observe . At best , then , gravitational redshifting can play only a minor role . We are forced back to the idea that velocities of recession must be responsible ; we know of no other mechanism which would do . And yet could there be a loophole ? It has been suggested that quasars might have been shot out from various galaxies , including our own , by some Titanic explosion , so that they have been hurled outward in all directions ; in other words they are genuinely receding as quickly as their Red Shifts  | indicate , but no overall expansion of the universe is involved . There is no known quasar with a spectral shift to the violet or short-wave end , and this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Galaxy . But just imagine the violence of the outburst needed ! The debris would surely have been spread out through space more or less evenly ; any local condensations would have been ripped apart at an early stage ? and as the material expanded , the formation of large masses would become less and less likely . It is inconceivable that the end product would be localized , very massive objects . All in all , this local hypothesis ' simply does not work , and by now there are very few astronomers who have any faith in it . Quasars , then , are extremely remote and powerful , but we can not be sure that the laws regulating their Red Shifts are the same as with the galaxies . Some contrary evidence has come from the work of the American astronomer Halton Arp , who has found that there are some significant alignments of some quasars with strings of galaxies . If the two classes of objects are associated , then they should have the same Red Shifts ; but they do not ? those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward speculation that we might have similar distances but different Red Shifts ; and if we accept the shifts of the galaxies as being pure Doppler effects , then some other factor must be involved for the quasars . It is fair to say that some of Arp 's alignments have been questioned , but in 1973 it was found that with two quasars very close together in the sky there was a similar difference in red-shifting . The chances that the twin quasars are at different distances from us are very slight , and if any more similar pairs are found we may have to do some radical re-thinking . At present the whole question remains open . For the moment I propose to accept the majority view that the distances of the quasars are exactly as predicted on the pure-Doppler hypothesis , but definite doubts remain . Moreover , it is true to say that all our measurements of distances in the further reaches of the universe depend upon the Red Shifts ; and if these prove to be misleading ? well , we may not be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Square Two .  | Let me repeat that on the cosmological picture a quasar may be far more luminous than any galaxy , but it has a much smaller diameter ? only a few light-years at most , as against Ioo , 000 light-years for the Milky Way system . The tongue of matter coming from 3C-273 , which is the brightest and presumably the nearest of all the quasars , may be 150,000 light-years long , but even this is not very much on the cosmical scale ; it would not , for instance , reach from the Sun out as far as the Magellanic Clouds . But if a quasar were even remotely comparable in size with a galaxy , it would appear as a blob , not a starlike point . This at once disposes of the idea that a quasar can be simply a remote galaxy with more than its fair share of highly luminous stars . Another suggestion , made in the early days , was that the energy-source might be a series of supernova ; one such outburst would trigger off another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There is no known way in which such a thing could happen , and no supernova stays at peak brightness for more than a few months ; quasars are longerlived than that , and must persist for a million years at least . Yet another idea was due to Sir Fred Hoyle , in 1964 , who proposed that a quasar might be caused by the sudden creation of new matter out of nothingness . On the old steady-state theory of the universe ( to which I will turn in the next chapter ) , matter appears spontaneously in the form of single atoms spread over a wide area ; if by some unknown process an immense mass could come into being in the same area at the same time , a quasar could result . However , this too has been discarded . There are many objections to it , and in any case the whole steady-state theory now seems to be defunct . Next there is the anti-matter theory , due to the great Swedish scientist Hannes Alfven . Basically , it is supposed that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own part of the universe ( koinomatter , to use Alfven 's term ) and a diametrically opposite kind ( antimatter ) . When an atom of koinomatter meets an atom of anti-matter , the two annihilate each other and produce a flash of energy . Spectroscopically , the two types would be indistinguishable , so that we would have no means of knowing whether a remote galaxy were made up of anti-matter or not . Alfv6n has developed the  | theory in detail , and suggests that between koinomatter and anti-matter regions there are boundary layers ' where a certain amount of mutual annihilation is always going on . Now , if a koinomatter galaxy met an anti-matter galaxy , the mutual destruction would be tremendous , and would certainly yield enough energy to produce a quasar . This is all very well , but the whole picture is so speculative that most astronomers view it with suspicion . We have absolutely no evidence that the basic principle is valid , and there is no obvious way of finding out . Therefore , it is best to regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science fiction writers have made great play of it . Suppose a koinomatter boy fell in love with an anti-matter girl ? Fond embraces would be a little hazardous ! ) To show how fluid our ideas are , let me give a very brief account of two theories , each of which has some backing from eminent theorists . The first is that a quasar is a very young galaxy , in the process of formation ; in fact a quasar and a Seyfert galaxy represent two stages of evolution of the same class of object . Intense internal activity might ? it is suggested ? provide enough energy for a quasar , though there would have to be some unknown additional factors involved . Alternatively , it has been proposed that a quasar is a galaxy which is coming to the end of its life , and that it has a rotating black hole in its centre ; the black hole is gobbling up the remaining stars round its rim , so that the stellar matter which manages to escape is given extra energy sufficient to produce a quasar-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a quasar contains many small black holes , which are merging together with the emission of vast quantities of radiation . Very young or very old ? We do not know . Recently there has been some slight evidence of galaxy-like features associated with at least some quasars ; and if this can be confirmed it will indicate that a quasar really is of galaxy ' nature , though we are still faced with the problem of deciding why it is so powerful . In America , J. B. Oke and J. Gunn , using the zoo-inch reflector , have carried out a long study of the strange object known as BL Lacert2e , which they find to be a quasar embedded in a normal large galaxy . This discovery is so recent that its full significance may not yet be apparent , but it certainly is of major importance .  | Whichever way we turn , quasars seem to be strange enough to make any astronomer adopt the attitude of Lewis Carroll 's White Queen , who made a habit of believing at least six impossible things before breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discovered six years later and which caused just as much of a sensation , were satisfactorily explained quite quickly ; nobody now doubts that they are neutron stars . But the quasars remain as puzzling as ever . All we can really say is that they are definitely outside our own Galaxy , probably lying at distances of thousands of millions of light-years ; that they are relatively small compared with ordinary galaxies ; and that their immense power is due to some process which could well involve gravitational energy ; and that they may be contained inside normal galaxies . Up to now we have had less than fifteen years of quasar research , and perhaps it is too optimistic to hope for a rapid solution . Energetic studies are going on all the time , and we can only hope that some of the answers will be found before long . I have the feeling that if we can only solve the great quasar problem , we will have made a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe itself ; but as yet we may not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS wondered how the universe began . This is natural enough ; in a way it is the most fundamental of all problems , and if we could solve it we would be well on the way to real wisdom . Unfortunately this is easier said than done , and during the past few decades arguments have raged not only between scientists and theologians but also between eminent scientists whose ideas are as opposite to each other as the proverbial chalk and cheese . Cosmology , the study of the history of the universe , can be highly controversial , and the arguments have sometimes tended to become heated . Before going any further , let me deal briefly with the theological side of the problem . The main argument originally presented was delightfully simple . In the seventeenth century Archbishop Ussher of Armagh stated blandly that the world came into existence at io a.m. on 26 October , 4004 B.C. He came to this conclusion by adding up the ages of the patriarchs and making various other calculations of the same kind . The figure was at once accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , it was clear to any scientist that the world is a great deal older than that ; the evidence of fossils , in particular , was conclusive . I am not sure when the Church conceded that Ussher 's date must be wrong , but it went very much against the clerical grain to concede that the Earth is thousands of millions of years old . I may add that some people question it even now ; there is still an Evolution Protest Movement , just as there is still a Flat Earth Society ! Ideas of this kind are ludicrous today , but they were not ludicrous three hundred years ago , and it would be quite unfair to laugh at Ussher . What he did , of course , was to claim that the universe was divinely created at a set moment in time ; and who can prove otherwise ? The fact that his date of 4004 B.C. was much too recent is neither here nor there . I refrained from calling this chapter " The Creation of the Universe " , which would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebel in this respect , and scientifically I do not believe that anyone has ever discussed the actual origin of the universe . The various big-bang , steady-state , cyclic and other theories , to be discussed below , relate to the evolution of the universe , which is a very different thing ; and if I may be forgiven for over-simplification , the situation can be summed up in a very few words . The one inescapable fact is that the atoms and molecules making up you , me , this book , Aunt Emily , the Sun , the Moon , the stars , the quasars and everything else exist . They must have come from somewhere , and there seem to be only two possibilities : 1 . The material making up the universe came into existence at one definite moment , which may be called the beginning of time : or 2 . The material has always existed , so that the universe had no beginning , and will presumably have no end . Unfortunately , both these alternatives lead us into appalling difficulties . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then what happened earlier ? But if we follow ( 2 ) , we are faced with picturing a period of time which had no beginning , which is equally impossible ? and would , I feel , be impossible even to the White Queen . In fact , we have not the faintest idea about the original creation . All we can do is to assume that matter existed , and work out an evolutionary sequence , perhaps beginning with a uniform diffuse gas and ending up with the universe as it is today . Actually , the trouble may well be that we are asking ourselves an unfair question . The universe is four-dimensional , and we are three-dimensional creatures . Whether we will ever make enough progress to come to any definite conclusions remains to be seen , but there is no immediate prospect of it . So far as everyday language is concerned , we are in a similar quandary with regard to the size of the universe . If space is finite , then what lies beyond it ? But if not , then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as before , we are a dimension short . There is one aspect of current research which can give a slight feeling of unease . In our studies of the universe , a tremendous amount depends upon the recession of the galaxies , and here we rely almost entirely upon the Red Shift . Practically  | all astronomers agree that the galaxies beyond our Local Group are racing away from us , and that the shifts are Doppler effects ; but just suppose that there is an error in interpretation ? If the galaxies are not receding , then most modern cosmological theories fail at once . Before the discovery of the quasars ( in particular , the recent twin quasar pair ) anyone who doubted the expansion of the universe was regarded in much the same light as a member of the Evolution Protest Movement . Even today the number of dissentients is very small , but it is not nil , and only when the quasar riddle has been cleared up will we be absolutely confident . For the moment , however , I will assume ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both galaxies and quasars indicate universal expansion , and I will also assume that the Hubble Constant remains valid out as far as we can see . ( To recapitulate : the Hubble Constant links distance with recessional velocity , so that the most remote galaxies are moving away with the greatest speeds . ) Working backwards , so to speak , we can find that in the past the galaxies must have been much closer together than they are now , whether or not they then existed in the forms we know ; and if the Hubble Constant has not altered in the meantime , it seems that expansion can not have been going on for much more than Io , 000 million years . This gives us something of a basis , and we do know , of course , that the ages of the Earth and the Moon are between four and a half and five thousand millions years , which fits in quite well . One of the first men to draw up a modern-type theory of the early days of the universe was a Belgian priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense primxval atom ' comprising all the material in the universe . The density of this primeval atom would have to be tremendous ; there could be no proper elements as we know them , and certainly no individual stars or galaxies . Then , between 20,000 million and 6o,000 million years ago , the primaeval atom exploded , sending its material outward in all directions . Expansion , the direct result of this outburst , went on for thousands of millions of years , until the whole universe had a diameter of something like I , 000 million light-years . At this stage things began to settle down , and clusters of galaxies began to form from the primeval material .  | We know that gravitation tends to draw material together , and one might imagine that as soon as the force of the explosion had spent itself the matter in the universe would move once more toward a common centre . Lemaitre supposed that this did not happen for the excellent reason that there is another force , cosmical repulsion , which acts in the contrary fashion to gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those within our Solar System , our Galaxy or even the Local Group ? it is negligible . If so , the settling-down ' universe would be in a state of balance , cosmical repulsion just counteracting gravity and preventing either a general expansion or a general contraction . Then , about 9,000 million years ago , some new disturbance tipped the scales in favour of cosmical repulsion ; expansion began , and has continued ever since , because a larger universe means that cosmical repulsion will grow stronger while the opposing force becomes weaker . Lemaitre 's theory was publicized and improved by Sir Arthur Eddington , one of the greatest of all pioneers of cosmology . A further modification was made by George Gamow , Russian by birth but American by adoption . This time there was no need for cosmical repulsion ; the present expansion was attributed solely to the force of the initial big bang ' . Gamow worked out the early temperatures very precisely . Five minutes after the start of expansion the temperature was I , 000 million degrees , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dropped to 40 million degrees , falling steadily and reaching a stable value millions of years later . Gamow also believed that all the chemical elements so familiar to us now were formed within half an hour after the universe began . There was no long-drawn-out state of balance , as in Lemaitre 's theory . And yet there was still the vexed question of " What happened before the beginning ? " and in 1948 a group of astronomers at Cambridge came out with a daring new theory which abolished the beginning ' entirely . Instead , they produced an hypothesis which involved the concept of continuous creation . The original papers were due to H. Bondi and T. Gold ; later modifications were introduced by Hoyle and others . Let us go back to the expansion of the universe . Light travels at 186,000 miles per second ; the most remote galaxies known are moving away at velocities not far short of this ? and the  | further away they are , the faster they go . Eventually , then , we will reach a distance when galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see such systems at all , no matter how strong our equipment ; their light will never reach us , and they will have passed over the boundary of the observable universe . On the big bang ' theory , the sky in the very remote future will look very different from that which we know . Since the galaxies are moving away from us at velocities which increase as the distances from us increase , there must come a time when all of them will have passed beyond the limit of the observable universe , in which case the sky will be empty of galaxies except those of the Local Group . Of course , the time-scale is very long . As Eddington once said , we need be in no hurry to study the galaxies before they vanish from our ken ! The Cambridge group rejected this scheme entirely . According to their steady-state or continuous creation theory , the universe has always been in much the same state as it is now , and will never change . As old galaxies pass over the observational boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that material is being created out of nothingness all the time , and that the average density of matter in any part of the universe remains constant . It is not supposed that a new galaxy can appear ready-made in an instant . Matter is created in the form of hydrogen atoms , and the rate of creation is very slow , though over the whole observable universe it amounts , in tons , to a figure I followed by 32 zeros per second . When hydrogen is created , the cycle begins ; with majestic slowness the material collects , and galaxies form . On the steady-state theory , then , an intelligent being living in the far future will see the same number of galaxies as we do today ? but they will not be the same galaxies . Such was the steady-state picture . It must , I think , have caused more controversy than any theory since Darwinian evolution , but there seemed to be no possible direct test , because matter created at such a rate would be harder to track down than a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one indirect test which , it was thought , might be good enough to show whether or not the universe were in a steady state . This was by studies of the distribution of very far-away galaxies.  | Now , remember that when we look out into space , we are also looking backward in time . Light from the Moon takes If seconds to reach us , so that we always see the Moon as it used to be 14 seconds ago ; the Sun appears in its form of 84 minutes ago , while the corresponding figures are over 4 years for Proxima Centauri , 27 years for Vega , about 900 years for Rigel and so on . The Andromeda Spiral is seen as it used to be 2,200,000 years ago ; but what about a really remote system , such as the famous radio galaxy 3C-295 ? Here we are looking back 5,000 million years , to a time before the Earth existed . And 5,000 million years is a very appreciable fraction of the time which seems to have elapsed since the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average amount of material in any given volume of space has always been approximately the same , so that if we could board a time-machine and go back into the past we would always find the overall aspect similar to that which we know . The galaxies would have the same sort of distribution . Not so on the evolutionary or bigbang theory , because thousands of millions of years ago the galaxies were crowded together , giving a completely different picture . We can not build a time-machine , but ? and this is the crux of the whole problem ? we can look back in time , simply by studying the remote galaxies . If the distribution is the same in those regions as it is nearer home , then the steady-state theory is presumably right . If the distribution is different , then the universe is not in a steady state , and the theory is wrong . When the Cambridge astronomers first put forward their revolutionary ideas , such a test could not be applied , because no telescope in the world was powerful enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only just coming into use . Moreover , radio astronomy was in its infancy , and quasars were as unknown as they were unsuspected . The first hint of decisive evidence came in 1955 , when the team led by Professor ( now Sir ) Martin Ryle published some counts of faint radio sources . Radio waves can be studied over greater distances than waves of visible light , and of course they move at the same velocity . The early results showed that the distribution of remote  | radio sources was markedly different from anything to be expected on the steady-state hypothesis . Naturally there were fierce arguments , and it is true that the preliminary counts were later shown to be highly suspect ; but later work pointed in the same direction , and the steady-state theorists had to fight an uphill battle . Various modifications were introduced . At one stage , I remember , it was suggested that we might be living in an expanding part of a steady-state universe ( ! ) and , with more reason , doubts were cast upon the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quasars , of course , came into the controversy from 1963 onward . In 1966 Dr. Dennis Sciama , who was then a steadystate supporter , began to study the numbers of quasars with different Red Shifts to see whether or not they fitted into the expected pattern . He and his colleagues found that there were many too many quasars with large Red Shifts to fit in with the model . True , there were ( and are ) doubts as to whether the quasars are reliable guides in this sort of research , since it is just possible that their Red Shifts are not connected with the general expansion of the universe ; but it soon became clear that the evidence was impressive even without the quasars . Next came a fortuitous discovery which dealt the steady-state idea a further blow . In 1965 two radio astronomers in America , A. Penzias and R. Wilson , were observing the sky with special radio equipment , and found that there was considerable noise ' from outer space , apparently coming in from all directions . At Princeton University , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio telescope designed to search for precisely this kind of effect . Their reason ran along the following lines : The original expansion of the universe could have been preceded by a collapse from a still earlier dilute phase ( widelyspread gas , presumably ) , and during this collapse the temperature of the universe would have been raised . After the big bang occurred , the heat decreased . Dicke calculated that approximately one minute after the explosion the overall temperature would have been a thousand million degrees , and that by now it would have dropped to about three degrees above absolute zero , i.e. - 270 ? C. As soon as he heard of the work by Penzias and Wilson , Dicke suggested that the radiation they had found  | was nothing more nor less than the background radiation which was left over from the big bang . Of course , I realize that I have over-simplified the problem very seriously ; but it does look as though the background radio noise has all the characteristics which would be expected on Dicke 's theory , and most astronomers incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , then steady-state is not . Plausible and elegant though it may be , it fails to fit the facts , and we must return to the picture of a universe which is evolving . On this basis , the next question to be asked is : Will the expansion continue indefinitely ? If the answer is yes ' , then presumably there has been only one big bang , and the galaxies ( or , more correctly , the groups of galaxies ) will continue to recede from each other until they have moved out of all contact . We can visualize a universe in the very far future , with each group of galaxies being left on its own ; and eventually the universe will die ? with nothing left but dead , lightless stars . Yet this , too , has been challenged . It may well be that the universe is cyclic , so that expansion is slowed down prior to a new stage of shrinking ; eventually all the material comes together again , so that there is another big bang , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not have happened many times in the past . Again we must rely upon radio astronomy to give us the first evidence , positive or negative . If the Hubble Constant is unchanged out to the very edge of the observable universe , then there can never be another contraction ; but it is possible that the very distant galaxies are receding less quickly than they would do if the Hubble figure applied in its accepted form . If this is true , then there will come a moment when the furthest galaxies will start to draw together again , and in perhaps 6o,000 million years ' time the universe will be reborn in another incredibly hot fireball ' . Here , of course , we have an alternative to cosmic death , because the **25;28;TOOLONG process could be repeated time and time again . Rather irreverently , I always think of this as the Concertina Theory . From the theoretical viewpoint , much depends upon the amount of material in the universe : is it enough to draw the galaxies back before they escape from each other 's pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible material the answer seems to be no ' , but there may be a great deal of material about which we know nothing , and once more the black hole concept comes into the discussion . If tremendous quantities of material are contained inside black holes , then there is no reason why the total mass of the universe should not be more than enough to stop the expansion before it is too late . Remember that although we can not see black holes , their gravitational pulls are just as strong as they would be if we could actually observe them . At the moment , we must concede that our ideas are still in a state of flux . The choice today seems to be between either indefinite expansion and final death , or a cyclic universe which could continue for ever . Philosophically , the second picture is obviously the more attractive , but we must await further confirmation ? or denial . This , I fear , is as far as we can go as yet . The fundamentals still elude us ; but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago , and we may hope that one day we will find the answers .  | FLIGHT TO THE Moon seemed impossible only a few decades ago , and the very idea of a probe to , say , Mars or Jupiter seemed to be wildly futuristic . Reputable scientists were saying that nothing of the sort could ever be managed . So far as interstellar travel is concerned , the same is true today , and I admit to being one of the pessimists . Yet I must stress that when I cast doubts upon the feasibility of reaching the stars , I am not suggesting that it will always remain impossible . All I am saying is that it is impossible by our present techniques , which is a very different thing . The trouble , basically , is one of sheer distance . The Apollo astronauts completed their lunar trips in less than a fortnight ; the Mars probes took only a few months on their way ; Pioneer 10 needed eighteen months to by-pass Jupiter . When we develop nuclear-powered rockets , these times can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually be able to explore the whole of the Solar System , at least by using unmanned space-ships . But let us go back to our scale model . If the Earth-Sun distance is represented by one inch , then the distance to Proxima Centauri is over four miles ; and neither Proxima nor the other members of the Alpha Centauri system seem to be likely centres of planetary systems . Of course one can not be sure ; but if we are searching for a planet similar to the Earth , it is only reasonable to start at a star similar to the Sun , and the two nearest candidates ( Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani ) are both about eleven light-years from us . Unfortunately we can not see planets of other stars , because of the distance problem . However , if we adopt any one of the current theories about the origin of the Solar System , according to which the planets grew up by accretion out of a cloud of material associated with the youthful Sun , it is surely reasonable to suppose that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally logical to think that an Earth-type planet will support Earth-type life , and most modern astrono-  | mers consider that life is likely to be widespread throughout the universe . The only possible way of finding out , by our 1974 techniques , is to establish radio contact with some other civilization , and this is by no means easy ! The first serious attempt was made in 196o , by Dr. Frank Drake and his colleagues at Green Bank in West Virginia , using the 85-foot radio telescope there . The project was known officially as Ozma , though I understand that the participants usually referred to it as Operation Little Green Men . After careful consideration , Drake selected a wavelength of 21.1 centimetres for his main search . As we have noted , radiation at this wavelength is sent out by interstellar hydrogen , and radio astronomers , wherever they may be , will be interested in it . There could be no hope of picking up intelligible messages ; we could hardly expect other beings to understand English ? but a rhythmical pattern of signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous step forward . To narrow the search still further , Drake concentrated upon the two nearest stars which are reasonably like the Sun : Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani . There was no response , and I doubt whether anything else could have been expected . The project was abandoned after a few months , though sporadic attempts have been made more recently in the Soviet Union . There have also been some sensational reports , such as that of 13 April , 1965 , when one British newspaper column on the front page was headed : " Astounding Claim by Russian Astronomers . Life in Space : Is it Superman ? " Actually the signals came from a quasar , CTA-1o2 ; and a later report , in 1973 , was equally disappointing . Journalists , like flying saucer enthusiasts , do tend to jump to conclusions . The whole problem of extra-terrestrial life is very complicated , and a discussion of it would be out of place here . Suffice to say , then , that although we do not know much about the fundamental nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up of living matter ; and so far as we can tell , the essential atom is that of carbon . There are indications that life , wherever it may be , must be carbon-based , in which case it will need an equable temperature , air to breathe and water to drink . Once  | we depart from this concept , we enter the science-fiction realm of Bug-Eyed Monsters ; and though I would be the last to deny that such creatures ma exist , all the current evidence is against them . If there are B.E.M.s , then most of our modern science is wrong , and this is something which I for one am most reluctant to believe . SUN . SCUTUM figure Therefore , we may justifiably assume that other civilizations will have at least some points in common with ours ; and for all we know , they may use radio and optical telescopes of the same kind . The Sun would not show any signs of eminence when seen from afar . From Proxima , for instance , it would be a fairly bright star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the second magnitude , and would lie on the borders of Sagittarius and Scutum ( Fig. 78 ) . ( Because both Proxima and Sirius are so near , the constellation patterns made up of much more remote stars would be much the same . ) The Earth , and even Jupiter , would be much too faint and close to the Sun to be detected with , say , a telescope comparable with our Palomar Zoo-inch reflector . Though we can not see planets of other stars , there is another method of attack . A massive planet orbiting a relatively modest and nearby star might cause perturbations marked enough to be detected . There are several reported cases , the most convincing being that of Barnard 's Star , which is only six light-  | years away , and is a dim Red Dwarf with a mere 1/2,300 of the Sun 's luminosity . It has the largest proper motion of any known star ? zo ? 3 seconds of arc per year , so that in 170 years it crosses a distance equal to the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper motion have led Peter van de Kamp and his colleagues in America to conclude that it is attended by two planets , each about the same mass as Jupiter . This seems reasonably conclusive , but let us remember that a planet no more massive than the Earth would be pitifully inadequate to cause measurable disturbances in the proper motion of any star . It would be rather pointless to launch out upon an interstellar voyage without the assurance of finding a suitable planet on arrival , and of this there is no prospect as yet . But in any case , the difficulties of journeying to the stars are immense in comparison with a local trip inside the Solar System . Presentday rockets would be useless ; so would the nuclear space-ships which should be built during the I98os . Centuries would be needed to reach even the nearest star . No doubt the space-ships of , say , A.D. 2100 will be capable of greater speeds , but even at the velocity of light it would still take four years to reach Proxima and eleven to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical objections to travel at such a velocity . According to Einstein 's theory of relativity , which has so far survived every test , there are strange effects when the speed of light is approached ; one 's mass increases and one 's time slows down . Both these remarkable phenomena have been confirmed to some extent . For instance , cosmic rays , which are high-speed particles coming from outer space , smash into the Earth 's upper air , creating other particles which we call mu-mesons ; these mu-mesons decay so quickly that they ought to have no time to reach the ground ? and yet they do so , because they are moving so fast that their time , relative to ours , is slowed down . This brings us on to what is called the Twin Paradox . Consider identical twins , one of whom elects to go on an interstellar journey at 99 per cent of the velocity of light . The traveller departs , and is away for a few years , during which interval he visits a neighbouring stellar system . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man , because  | the traveller 's time-scale has been slowed down compared with that of Earth . If taken further , this means that the traveller could be away for what he would imagine to be a decade or so , and then return to be greeted by his **25;55;TOOLONG . This time-dilation effect has caused a tremendous amount of argument , and by no means all authorities accept it at face value . There may be a fundamental fallacy somewhere . In any case , the effect does not become appreciable except at very high velocities ; so far as travel to the Moon and planets is concerned , we can ignore it completely . No vehicle which we can think of building as yet could move fast enough to make its planners take the time-dilation phenomenon into account . It is , I suppose , conceivable that we will eventually be able to construct space-ships which will work up to an appreciable fraction of the velocity of light ; but the critical value of 186,000 miles per second ( or , if you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can never be reached by a material object . This , to me , indicates that we can never achieve interstellar travel by using rockets . Various ideas have been proposed , all of them rather peculiar . The space-ark ' is a science fiction favourite ; the original pioneers , and several succeeding generations , die during the voyage , and only their descendants survive to reach their target ( by which time , I suspect , the purpose of the entire journey would have been forgotten ) . On a second plan , the crew are deep-frozen and put into a state of suspended animation until the time comes for them to wake up and prepare to land on , say , Epsilon Eridani B. I can only say that I would not personally care to attempt anything of this sort , and I can not believe that the human mind and body would tolerate it . No : if we are to travel between the stars , it must surely be by some non-material technique . It may sound fantastic to talk about teleportation or even thought-travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Julius Caesar or King Canute . I am quite ready to accept that something of the sort will come along one day , but as yet we have nothing to guide us , so that speculation is both endless and pointless . Of course , it may be that interstellar civilizations will contact us before we are able to contact them . Mankind is still young , and there is plenty of time ahead of us unless we are stupid  | enough to turn our planet into a radioactive waste . As yet we are isolated from all the other beings who must exist in the universe , but this isolation may not continue indefinitely . Time will tell . Meanwhile , we have at least sent one probe into deep space . In December 1973 the automatic space-craft Pioneer io passed within 90,000 miles of Jupiter , and by now it has well and truly begun a never-ending journey . It has escaped from the Solar System , and it will never return . It carries a plaque , just in case some alien race finds it and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its ever being picked up are millions to one against ? but one never knows . And it is a measure of our progress that an Earth-made vehicle is at this moment travelling outward in the space between the stars .
