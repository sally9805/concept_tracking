txt Letters Fuel Consumers ' Oil-Price Lesson From Europe Alternatives To the Editor : As the gasoline lines recede after Labor Day , it is appropriate that the absence of a U.S. oil policy again be discussed . The first problem is that the Administration continues to view oil pricing and availability as domestic issues when they are really within the province of foreign affairs . Production and consumption of oil are both international problems , and the current turbulence is entirely caused by pricing policies not being permitted to balance supply and demand . Until there is a clear recognition by all concerned that OPEC 's high prices are a direct result of excessive U.S. demand , there can be no solution . The excessive demand is fueled by a domestic pricing policy which maintains low prices on domestic oil , a charity which the oil companies are compelled to give to the rich and poor alike . God knows the rich do n't need it and the poor should n't expect it ; there is no assurance in either the Scriptures or the Constitution that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to cheap oil . To Congress we should all say , " Have courage , deregulate and let the law of supply and demand show that it To the Editor : In a Sept. 3 letter , James Andrew Marks charges that the present-day soldier " tacitly accepts the American irresponsibility and horror in Vietnam " and " is willing to subject him , self to the same ignominy . " I must disagree . My experiences with the enlistees of ? the volunteer Army has convinced me that the allegation by Mr. Marks is groundless . It has no more validity than a condemnation of newly admitted members of the bar because of their occupational links with that small band of lawyers whose Watergate-related crimes brought disgrace and dishonor to their profession and to their nation . We can no more brand practicing soldiers and lawyers with the sins and shortcomings of their predecessors than we can castigate today 's electorate , the apathy , ignorance or gullibility of whose forerunners gave political power to those civilian authorities whom history will hold responsible for the duplicities and outrages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their common defense by requiring the Congress to raise and maintain an army and a navy .

By voting Sept. 5 to help boat people and bar even indirect aid to Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos , we are only perpetuating the tragedy . When will we learn that seeking to isolate those we disagree with only makes matters worse ? Millions of Cambodians already face starvation , and as I saw in my seven-week visit last year , millions more Vietnamese are on the verge of starvation . It was an outrage to humanity when we spent a hundred billion dollars to destroy Indochina . Now we can add to that our hypocritically motivated concern for helping boat people while denying even one cent of help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major reason for their leaving . ROBERT RICHTER New York , Sept. 7 , 1979 still works . " As Europe shows already , when gasoline prices increase , demand drops . When demand for OPEC oil drops , their prices will also drop , and drop dramatically . Fringe benefits for the U.S. economy would be an external-account surplus with a magical effect on the dollar value abroad and on inflation at home . By all means , tax the profits the oil companies make ? all other profits are taxed anyway ? but use the taxes to generate an effective public-transportation system for the less-well-off who will no longer be able to afford the gas-guzzling automobiles which many of them now use . The Europeans demand good , subsidized public transportation simply because the poor can not afford the high prices of gasoline which have applied there for years . This is one lesson the U.S. could learn from its European counterparts . In that context , the present Administration appears to have adopted many ideas that originated with Callaghan 's ministry in England .

We provide neither when we associate them unjustly with the tragedy of Vietnam . GEORGE D. EGGERS JR . Brigadier General , U.S.A. ( Ret . ) Princeton , N.J. , Sept. 5 , 1979 To the Editor : Twenty years ago , the United States experienced a failure of nerve and imagination in its policy toward Cuba . A more creative and bold approach to Fidel Castro in those first critical months of the revolution might have prevented Cuba from falling under the influence of the Soviet Union . The doom-sayers , afraid that what finally happened would happen , won out , and the United States , paralyzed by this fear , stood by helplessly as this selffulfilling prophecy came to pass .

Nicaragua , like To the Editor : Personal experience and national statistics refute New Jersey Energy Commissioner Joel Jacobson 's contention that the consumer " must pay whatever the price of fuel is because he can not enjoy the theoretical euphoria of ' elasticity of demand ' " letter Sept. 5 . I still drive to work but use only half the gasoline because I now have a more efficient car . I use less heating oil but do n't freeze because I 've insulated my house and installed a wood stove . I use less oil-based electricity , partly because I have a solar water heater and partly because my utility has installed nuclear capacity . ? National statistics back up my own experience concerning the effect of prices on consumption . In the transportation sector , the growth rate in oil demand was 4.4 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8 percent a year from 1973 through 1978 . In the residential/commercial sector during the same periods , the growth rates were 4.7 percent and 1.6 percent , respectively . Mr. Jacobson argues that the international market price for oil is artifical because in some OPEC countries oil costs 25 cents to produce.He fails to understand that prices in a competitive market are set by the costs of the last increment of production ( marginal costs ) , not the first increment of production ( marginal costs ) . He should know that the marginal cost of oil ? from the North Sea , Colorado and new discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico , for example ? is many times 25 cents a barrel . Mr. Jacobson apparently thinks the U.S. and Europe would be better off without marginal oil , because the price controls he advocates impede development of its production . He would have the industrialized world even more dependent on OPEC . J. ALAN COPE Manager , Policy Development and Economics , Conoco , Inc .

Yes , wait and see and watch another selffulfilling prophecy come to pass I Let us hope that this time those responsible for United States policy in that region will have the nerve and the imagination to act effectively .

DOROTHY DILLON Director , Washington Center for Latin American Studies Washington , Sept. 4 , 1979 Our Country 's Protectors Nicaragua 's Revolution Needs Friends ' Why the West Side Wants Westway To the Editor : In your Aug. 30 issue , Governor Carey is quoted as saying , " The environmentalists , acting in good faith , can stop us from building that highway Westway for my entire lifetime . " Westsiders For Westway are people of " good faith " who support Westway for environmental reasons and believe it is the most important urban and transportation improvement in the state . The bureaucratic and legal delays involved in trying to give up Westway for an uncertain amount of transit monies would outlast the Governor 's long ( we hope ) lifetime . Before Westway could be traded in for highway and transit funds , the Federal Secretary of Transportation would have to rule that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified and connected interstate system . This is not as cut and dried as it seems . With the abandonment of the ill-conceived Mid-Manhattan and Lower Manhattan expressways , Westway is the last remaining opportunity to connect the existing links to New Jersey ( the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels ) with Brooklyn and Long Island 's network of interstate highways . The huge east-west traffic , vital to the economies of New Jersey , Brooklyn and Long Island , makes such a connection essential to the New York region . Any alternative roadway would have to start at square one , where Westway began in 1971 . Legal requirements would include public hearings , preliminary and final environmental impact statements ( written and proved ) and an **31;1026;TOOLONG permit . There would also be lawsuits to contend with , brought by people who care about our city , to prevent the building of a truck highway on our waterfront that would violate national ambient air quality standards and other aspects of the Clean Air Act .

Anthony dollar 's nonacceptance by the public could have been avoided if our Government officials , in their travels at taxpayers ' expense , had taken note of how the British replaced their 10-shilling paper money with the 50-pence coin . The British authorities made the new coin seven-sided so it could be distinguished at once from any other coin of comparable size . ( They had already withdrawn the old threepenny with its 12 sides . ) Perhaps if our officials did some traveling at their own expense , they would pay closer attention to the money they 're spending ? and thereby learn something useful .
