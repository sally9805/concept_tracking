// 58 November ' 77 It is a game that assumes almost mythical proportions . The University of Southern California versus Notre Dame . Notre Dame , the Midwest school where Catholicism is its other religion . USC , the West Coast superpower where granting degrees is its other reason for existence . It is the oldest intersectional rivalry in collegiate football . It is the highest-rated regular college game of the TV season . It is a battle that pits giant against giant and the loyalties of much of the country line up for the opening kick-off . This year , World War XLVIII will be fought on October 22 near the South Bend of the St. Joseph River in north-central Indiana . USC has won every game with Notre Dame in the 1970s except one , but do n't think for a moment that the Trojans of Southern California can take this year 's game for granted . The series stands at 26-18-4 in favor of the Irish of Notre Dame . During one period of 28 years , from 1939 until 1967 , the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that single Notre Dame game that USC lost in the ' 70s was dropped in 1973 at Notre Dame . ) This is a contest of history-making upsets . Virtually every year the ranking of the nation 's top ten teams is affected by the game 's outcome , and in some years the national champion is decided by the game . Some of the greatest games in the history of the sport have been chapters in the USC-Notre Dame annals . Consider 1973 : The mighty University of Southern California came to the game with a 22-game string of victories , one of its longest winning streaks ever . The Trojans were the defending national champions and were still talking about the previous year 's game in which sophomore Anthony Davis had scored six . . . six . . . touchdowns against the Irish in USC 's 45-23 one-sided victory . Notre Dame had n't beaten USC since 1966 , but was undefeated that season . Notre Dame held Davis to a single touchdown and won the game decisively 23-14 . Parseghian left the field on the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay walked off the field humming ( believe it or not ) " The Notre Dame Victory March . " The year 1972 had seen sophomore Anthony Davis set six school records scoring six TDs in a major tilt ; 1973 had turned out to be yet another classic . And yet , as great as these two games were in the greatest of intersectional rivalries , the 1974 epic was destined to overshadow both the 1972 and ' 73 contests . It was the last regular season coaching day for the great Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian , who had brought championship football back to Notre Dame for 11 explosive years with a record of 95 wins against 16 defeats and four ties . With only one defeat all year , Parseghian 's team came ready to seal their coach 's career with a victory that had an outside chance of making them Number One in the nation . The Irish machine hummed smoothly through three touchdowns , three conversions and a field goal to run up a safe margin of 24 points with only a few seconds left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis scored for USC with less than a minute in the half , but the conversion failed . It was 24-6 at half-time , with only two quarters left between Parseghian and the end of his brilliant regular season career , with another national championship a strong possibility . But this was no mere football game , it was a USC-Notre Dame epic . In the next 16 minutes and 44 seconds , the Trojans stunned Notre Dame and the football world with a blitz of 55 points . USC coach John McKay reacted by taking out the first team and finishing the game with substitutes to keep the score reasonable . Notre Dame coach Parseghian reacted by reconsidering his announced resignation . The game did decide the national championship , but not in the direction Parseghian had intended ; the title went to USC . After some more reflection Parseghian kept his plans to retire , and his team vindicated the loss with a 13-11 post-season victory in the Orange Bowl over Coach Bear Bryant 's Alabama team , which was favored to win by nine points . That 55-24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular college career of one Anthony Davis , who had struck the spark in the closing seconds of the first half that had set his team on fire . He fanned the flame by returning the opening kick-off of the second half with an incredible 102-yard touchdown return and two more touchdowns after that . At the final gun , it was Notre Dame 24 , Davis 26 and USC 29 . Anthony Davis walked back to his dressing room with a career total of 11 touchdowns and 68 points against Notre Dame . Only 20 colleges have scored that many points against Notre Dame , and there have been 95 institutions which have played Notre Dame over the years and scored less . The University of Illinois , for example , has played Notre Dame 11 times and has n't yet amassed that many points against them . The Notre Dame-USC rivalry captures the fascination of the football world , and even non-football fans , because of the larger-than-life dimensions of the contest . Both schools are private , USC dominates the Western football world and always has . Notre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both have student bodies obsessed , absolutely obsessed , with the football cult , and both have among the most fanatically loyal alumni bodies in the country . Both pride themselves on their academic excellence and both inspire a following far beyond their own student and alumni ranks . The USC-Notre Dame game itself dates back 51 , years . The two teams have played continuously since 1926 , except for the war years of 1943-44-45 . The USC-Notre Dame game was the last in the fabled careers of Knute Rockne and Howard Jones , the last regular season game for Ara Parseghian and the next-to-the-last game for Frank Leahy ( although he did n't attend the game ) . In all , 3.2 million have watched the two teams play over the years . Notre Dame has played only the Naval Academy more times than it has faced USC , and the Trojans have played Notre Dame more than they have played their cross-town rival , UCLA . No team has scored more points against the Irish than has USC ( 720 ) , and no team has scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 879 ) . Both teams have other ongoing rivalries . The Notre Dame-Army series was one of the most famous in football and was interrupted because of both schools ' concern about the heavy betting on the game ( estimated at $5 million in 1946 ) . Around Indiana , the Notre Dame-Purdue game is an important one , and the Michigan State-Notre Dame series is closely followed as well . USC has other classic rivals , too . The annual USC-UCLA game virtually suspends life in Southern California each year , and the ongoing feud with Woody Hayes and Ohio State unites the entire West Coast behind USC when those two titans meet . But the USC-Notre Dame game transcends other rivalries . From the very beginning , the match was a logical one . Notre Dame came to Southern California for the first bout in 1926 and won it with only two minutes left , 13-12 . Legendary coaches Howard Jones of USC and Knute Rockne of Notre Dame renewed a rivalry begun when Jones was at Iowa ( he ended a 21-game winning streak of Rockne and Notre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest crowd ever to watch a football game in Los Angeles ( 74,559 ) and " the greatest array of coaching talent ever gathered together . " Howard 's brother , T. A. D. Jones of Yale , was there . So were Glenn ( Pop ) Warner of Stanford , Bob Zuppke of Illinois and all of the major West Coast coaches . After the contest Rockne told Jones it was the greatest game he had ever seen . Attendance records fell again the next year , as the largest crowd ever to watch a football game in the U.S. saw the Irish win again by a single point at Soldier Field on Chicago 's lakefront . A crowd of 117,000 watched as USC great Morley Drury missed a conversion because the wet ball was too slippery . As great as this star was in both games , he missed the two points that sealed his team 's first two defeats by Notre Dame . For the third game , Rockne brought his worst team ( 5-4 ) to California and USC made the most of the opportunity to nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first national championship season . The next year , less than a month after the stock-market crash of 1929 , Notre Dame brought to Soldier Field a team that was billed as its finest in five years , and USC showed up with the highest scoring team in the nation . The series was already a classic and the score stood 6-6 at halftime , with another record crowd ( 112,192 ) looking on . Rockne fired up his team with one of his celebrated half-time speeches and the Irish rallied to squeak by with a 13-12 thriller . Three of the first four games had been decided by a single point . Yet , in the succeeding half century not a single Notre Dame-USC game has ended with a one-point difference . In 1930 , Rockne tricked his team by placing wake-up calls for each player at their Phoenix hotel on the way ; then after Continued on page 102 // 102 November ' 77 roll into a ball .

The team fell for it , rallied to win one for Rockne ( who , of course , never intended to go back ) , and overwhelmed USC 27-0 . That dramatic win came against a USC team that was labeled " one of the greatest football teams of all times " by Pop Warner , after his Stanford team lost to the Trojans 42-12 earlier in the season . For the Notre Dame team , it meant a national championship to close out its undefeated season . For the great Knute Rockne the victory was the capstone on his fabled coaching career . Less than four months later Knute Kenneth Rockne died tragically in a plane crash near Bazaar , Kansas . The stage was set for the 1931 game , the sixth game of the series and one of the most famous games in football history .

Notre Dame brought a string of 26 victories to the contest and the memory that USC had been Rockne 's last game the year before . The Irish kept the game a shutout for three quarters with a comfortable 14-0 lead . They had had so few touchdowns scored against themthat year that they had forgotten there was a goal line behind them as well as in front . Gus Shaver of USC knew it was there , though , and finally managed a first-person visit early in the fourth quarter . After missing the conversion , the score was still a safe 14-6 for the Irish . Then another USC touchdown by Shaver and the score was 14-13 . Everybody in the stadium knew the Trojans were defeated except the USC players . They fought for yet another touchdown , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , the Trojans faced a third down at the 13-yard line . It was a dramatic moment . The 52,000 spectators held one collective breath knowing the ball game 's outcome rested on the toe of one Johnny Baker . The field goal was perfect and the game was won by USC 16-14 . Los Angeles went cuckoo . They welcomed the Trojans back to the city with a ticker-tape parade watched by 300,000 wild-eyed Angelenos . An alumnus had had the game filmed , and the film stock was rushed back to Hollywood for conversion into a full-length motion picture . The film broke the house record at Loew 's State Theater , then the top downtown movie house . The 1931 game helped lock the two teams into a permanent arrangement . Four of the six games had been thrill-packed squea kers , matching two of the top teams in the country . The rivalry had begun around the awesome figures of coach Knute Rockne of Notre Dame and coach Howard Jones of the University of Southern California . What ? You say you 've heard plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones deserves to be remembered , too . He coached the Trojans for 15 years , from 1925 until 1940 , winning more games for USC than Rockne , Leahy or Parseghian won for Notre Dame . He was signed on for $10,000 a year by USC after the school 's first choice turned down the job . The first choice had been Knute Rockne . Howard Jones was bright and successful . He graduated from Yale in ' 08 after two years on Walter Camp 's All American teams and went immediately into the head coaching job at Syracuse , where he compiled a respectable 6-3-1 record at age 23 . Then at age 24 he returned to Yale , where his team was not only undefeated , but kept all opponents from getting inside the Yale 30 all year long . He produced six All-Americans that year , his second year in coaching . He coached at Ohio State , then Yale again , retired from coaching for a few years , then spent nine successful years at Iowa State from 1916 until his USC debut in 1925 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more spectacular than producing winning football teams year after year after year . He was a strict football fundamentalist , using only six or seven basic formations in his single-wing operation . He concentrated on straight power rather than deception . He once said , " Football to me means power  --  massed power , functioning smoothly , driving forward relentlessly . " He felt that if each man did his job properly , the play would work . His long , and no South Bend coach with more than a couple of quick years in the job chalked up that kind of record . Rockne was an outgoing , magnetic man who was a practical joker with few peers and a perpetual cigarsmoker . His stream of quips made him " good copy " for a hungry sports press . He did his part by leading a colorful career and the press did its part by making him a national figure , He once told a group of linemen that " the only qualifications for linemen are to be big and dumb , " then realizing that his backs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " To play back , you only have to be dumb ! " When Rockne died in 1930 , Will Rogers spoke for a bereaved nation players would even tell the other team where the play was going and then run the bail through the spot . Jones was an incredible taskmaster , driving his boys to do men 's jobs and never taking off the pressure to perform , and perform correctly . . . every time . He had an almost religious fetish for clean play . His players literally did not know how to play dirty . His teams won two national championships , five Rose Bowls and eight Pacific Coast titles , yet his more colorful contemporaries are remembered better : Knute Rockne , Amos Alonzo Stagg and Pop Warner . Even his brother T.A.D . " Tad " Jones of Yale is better remembered , despite a less successful career . Rockne was on the opposite side of the field from Jones literally and figuratively . His colorful personality made him a legend in a time when there was awesome competition for legends . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Rogers , Charles Lindbergh , Jack Dempsey and Babe Ruth . He discovered George Gipp ( whose tragic and early death inspired Rockne 's " Win one for the Gipper ! " half-time speech ) , he built the " Four Horse . men " backfield , he established Notre Dame as a school synonymous with championship college football , and he helped establish college football as a national fetish at the same time Babe Ruth was doing the same for baseball . Like Jones , he was a brilliant man , but he earned his degree the hard way . He never finished high school and he entered Notre Dame when he was a senior campus citizen at 22 . He graduated when he was 26 , summa cum laude , and was captain of his football team in his senior year . He never lost a football game as a Notre Dame student and he seldom lost as a coach . His record at Notre Dame was 105-12-5 with a victory percentage of .897 . No Notre Dame coach before or since was in the job as ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would take a president 's death to make a whole nation shake their heads in real sorrow and say , ' Ai n't it a shame he 's gone ? ' Well , that 's what this country did today , Knute , for you . You died one of our national heroes . Notre Dame was your address but every gridiron in America was your home . " After that Game-of-allGames the following year , in the pandemonium of the winning dressing room , coach Howard Jones asked one of the visiting dignitaries for directions to the cemetery where Rockne was buried . Within an hour after that mind-boggling victory , Jones and the entire USC team were standing at Rockne 's graveside , where Jones delivered an impromptu eulogy . Rockne had been an important figure for USC , too , as cofounder of the annual competition and one who had managed to teach USC teams more than they had been able to teach the Irish . USC , along with Notre Dame and the world , would miss the great Knute Rockne . Rockne had n't brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football to the school . In the 21 years of Notre Dame football before Rockne arrived , there had been 13 coaches , but never a losing coach . Not one . But Rockne sharpened the school 's football image and made it permanent . Jones did the same for USC . USC football had started in the late 1880s at almost the exact time when Notre Dame football had started . USC had had 10 coaches prior to Jones , without a single losing coach . Only John McKay coached more Trojan teams than Jones ( before he left in 1976 to become coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ) . John McKay coached 16 games against Notre Dame . Eight he won ; eight he did n't , but his most memorable games were probably the first USC game of Ara Parseghian and the last USC game of the great Notre Dame coach . The first Parseghian-McKay game was in 1964 . Parseghian was new to Notre Dame but not slow . He was off to a perfect nine-game winning season , which would be the first winning season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookie coach since 1913 , when Jesse Harper tutored a Notre Dame team which happened to be captained by Knute Rockne . So Parseghian 's Irish stood 9-0-0 and 11-point favorites for their last game of the season against a Trojan team that had already lost three games . Heisman winner John Huarte hit All-American Jack Snow to add a TD to a Notre Dame field goal and bring the Irish lead to 10-0 . Bill Wolski added an end-run touchdown to post a 17-0 half-time lead . ( The Irish always seem to be ahead of USC something-to-nothing at half-time ! ) But during the half , someone passed the word to USC that a football game was being played in their stadium . They came out playing as if the game had just begun . They marched 68 yards on their first set of downs to a Mike Garrett touchdown ( another All-American ) . In the fourth quarter a pass from Craig Fertig to Fred Hill brought the score to 17-13 . With only a minute and a half left in the game , flanker Rod Sherman asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the catch . and the winning touchdown . Notre Dame fought to the end , but the game finished with 20-17 on the scoreboard , a 9-1 record for Parseghian and a Number 3 national ranking . But maybe Notre Dame had the last laugh after all . Following the game , the Athletic Association of Western Universities voted to send Oregon State  --  not USC  --  to the Rose Bowl that year . Pick a year . Almost any year since 1926 was punctuated with a legend . ary Notre Dame-USC game . 1926. 1927. 1928. 1929. 1931. 1936. 1937 , and so on and so on . One of the greatest of that  --  or any other  --  series was the 1948 14.14 tie . It was a game that had everything ... including a fourth-quarter earthquake . Notre Dame had n't been beaten or tied for 21 games and came West with four All-Americans , compared to none for the Trojans . As usual the Irish led at half-time , with a skunk game going , 7.0 . In the third quarter , fullback Bill Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then in the last quarter Martin scored again . The score stood at 14-7 with time running out , and the hysterical Trojan fans were already making plans for the evening 's celebration of the stunning upset . Notre Dame halfback Bill Gay approached an official and asked , " Mr. Referee , how much time is there left to play ? " The referee replied , " Two minutes and 35 seconds . " " Thank you , Sir , that 's enough time , " responded Gay , walking back for the kick-off . And it was . Gay returned the kick-off to the Trojan 13 , and after a bitterly contested Trojan penalty for pass interference the Irish scored from the new line of scrimmage only two yards shy of the goal . Leon Hart scored and Steve Oracko kicked the tying point with only 35 seconds left on the clock . " God bless you , Steve Oracko , " his teammates chanted on the train all the way back to Notre Dame . Notre Dame was happy to have robbed defeat in the closing seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Notre Dame streak . This year history will be made again . Both coaches are relatively new to the two schools . John Robinson finished his rookie year at USC last year with an impressive 11.1 record , a Rose Bowl victory and the Number Two team in the nation . In coach Dan Devine 's second year at Notre Dame last year , he posted a 9-3 record , won the Gator Bowl and also finished in the nation 's top ten . This will be the first game of the second half century of the greatest of all intersectional rivalries . The Great Irish against Mighty Trojans .
