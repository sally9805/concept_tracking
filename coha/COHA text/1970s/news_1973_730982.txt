txt Mrs. John C. Hawk is a leader of the forces opposed to construction of a $6 million condominium on what may or may not be a historic site here . Here 's where she stands : " We 're going to make it . People care too much about Charleston to let this happen . " A. Leigh Baier is the Atlanta real-estate developer who wants to build the project . He does n't think the ladies of Charleston have a chance . " I 'll give you a quote that tells you how I feel , " he says . " The dogs yelp , and the caravan moves on . " Palmer Gaillard is the mayor of Charleston , and here 's where he stands in the controversy : " I stand squarely behind both sides . " The issue in question is what should happen to a half-block area that is just a short walk from the main downtown section here and whose 14 squatty buildings were until recently mainly warehouses for beer and wine . Mr. Beier has bought the decrepit two- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $6 million " high-rise " condominium ? " high-rise " in Charleston means eight stories  --  for middle- and upper-income families . Mrs. Hawk and plenty of other people in Charleston think that that is about the worst thing to happen since Gen. Sherman marched through town . Mr. Baier and the local Chamber of Commerce think it 's about the best thing to happen since the Confederate Army captured Fort Sumter . And everybody is anxiously waiting for Oct. 15 to see what will happen . For Oct. 15 is the deadline that Mr. Beier and his foes have agreed to in a unique settlement of a suit to stop the development . After Mrs. Hawk 's forces tried persuasion , propaganda and picketing , they went to court . And to avoid drawn out suits , Mr. Baier made them a deal . If they could raise the money by Oct. 15 , he said , he 'd sell them the old buildings for the $1.26 million he has invested so far . If they ca n't , he gets to proceed without any further objections from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by the women has in mind is buying the site and then reselling it to developers who will stick to a low-rise theme , perhaps transforming the structures into townhouses and shops . So far , the women have raised about $300,000 in cash and in pledges of interest-free loans , and now they are concentrating on getting more loan pledges from local business lenders . Earlier , they had hoped to raise $1 million by getting a million people each to give one dollar ( strong on symbolism , the ladies obtained post office box 1,000,000 ) , but it soon became clear that even though donations were coming in from every state but Alaska , the goal would n't be met . " Do you have any idea how much $1 million is ? " asks Mrs. Hawk , who does have an idea . Mr. Baier doubts that the women will be able to raise the money , and he thinks their idea is kind of dumb , anyway . " It 's a poor use of money compared to , say , giving it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't care if they raise the money or not , but he says he is rather disturbed at some of the newspaper headlines about the fight . One headline said " Charleston Fighting Biggest Battle Since Sumter . " " That gives me a dignity I 'm not entitled to , " he says , but he ca n't resist adding : " I might point out that they ( the people of Charleston ) lost that war , too . " The matter has n't always been as calm as it is now . There was almost a physical confrontation a few weeks ago when a housewife across the street from the site heard that demolition was to begin that day . Like a modern-day Paul Revere , she dashed from the house , mounted her bicycle and rode through the narrow streets of the neighborhood shouting " The bulldozers are coming ! " " Another High-Rise Ghetto ? " Within two hours , say leaders of the Save Charleston Foundation , nearly 100 pickets converged on the site , several vowing to fling themselves in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pickets even carried signs , saying things like " NO NEW YORK SKYLINE HERE . " The local newspapers are supporting the women , and so is the mayor , sort of . " I certainly have no argument with the ladies , " he says . On the other hand , he has no argument with Mr. Baler , either . " Mr. Baier came in here and said , ' I want to invest $6 million in downtown Charleston , ' " the mayor says , " and I said , ' Thank God , what can I do to help you ? ' " While the dispute goes on , a related argument also ' rages . The women say the buildings that may or may not be razed have historical significance . For one thing , they say it was here that a float was built in 1774 for the Charleston Tea Party ( a Dixie version of the Boston affair ) . Some of the buildings are of early 1800s vintage , they say . Mr. Baler says that 's nonsense . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1938 , " he says . The women say the storm only destroyed one building . Townsfolk say the women are ' closer to the truth .
