As he interviewed dozens of sources in the pop-recording field , New York Correspondent James Willwerth was frequently asked about his journalistic background . " I had to admit , " he says , " that I 've spent most of my time covering organized crime , rebellions , riots and the war . " His book about Viet Nam , Eye in the Last Storm , was recently published by Grossman . The usual reply , recalls Willwerth , was , " You 've come to the right place . You 'll feel at home . " <P> Though the pop music wars are less dangerous than Willwerth 's earlier assignments , they are a fierce struggle for the record companies . This week in our cover story we examine the $3 billion-a-year recording industry and the battle tactics being used . <P> For six weeks , Willwerth visited record industry headquarters , meeting pop music 's promoters and star performers . Record companies , he found , can be ruggedly zany . " All the ingredients of a carnival are there : clowns , hucksters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an atmosphere of distorted mirrors and colored lights . I loved them all . " <P> In the old Charlie Chaplin studios in Hollywood , Willwerth found Lou Adler , whose Ode Records is one of the most successful small recording companies . Midway through the interview , Adler excused himself , then dashed downstairs to join a basketball game between two bands , Chicago v. Cheech and Chong . Traveling on to San Francisco , Willwerth talked to Rock Impresario Bill Graham about his difficulties in starting a new record company , then accompanied a local record promoter on a tour of Bay Area radio stations . In Nashville the following week , the correspondent sat in on a recording session by Folk Artist Eric Andersen . <P> Back in New York , Willwerth turned his files over to Contributing Editor Mark Goodman , who wrote the story , and to Reporter-Researcher Rosemarie Tauris Zadikov , who did some interviewing herself . Zadikov , a seven-year veteran of TIME 's Music section , was reared on classical music , but finds her tastes broadening . " People are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " If they find it in popular music , then that is where they will go , even if they are over 30. "
