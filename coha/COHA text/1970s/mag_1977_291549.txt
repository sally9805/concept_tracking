So now the one-week blitz was over-the most intensive effort by a U.S. President , in or out of wartime , to rally the nation behind a common cause . A stream of high Government officials sought out television interviews and speech appearances to continue the crusade . Politicians searched for the high ground from which to fight the months of battles that lay ahead . The Administration began releasing figures to show how much money it thinks the average American consumer would actually be saving - instead of losing-under the President 's program . And Jimmy Carter had clearly achieved his first , vital goal : he had captured the public 's attention and convinced a vast majority of Americans that the nation 's energy shortage was genuine and steadily growing worse . <P> Not everyone was at all certain that , as the President claimed , a " national catastrophe " would ensue if nothing was done to check the spiraling U.S. dependence on imported oil and rapidly depleting gas and America 's wasteful ways . But as TIME correspondents probed public reaction across the country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still insisting that the energy crisis was a nefarious conspiracy by Big Oil and Big Government to drive up the price of fuel and fleece the citizen . Across the political spectrum and through the many segments of U.S. society , Carter was being applauded for asking the nation to confront the painful truths about energy . <P> " There 's no doubt we have a crisis upon us , " declared James Thompson , the new Republican Governor of Illinois . " The President is to be congratulated for facing it . " Agreed David Roderick , president of U.S. Steel : " He has laid it all on the line . Our industries , our jobs , our American way of life could be in jeopardy . " After listening to Carter 's Monday " sky is falling " speech , North Carolina 's Democratic Governor James B. Hunt Jr . observed : " If anyone has any doubts of a crisis , they must be blind and deaf . That was the most carefully reasoned statement of an immense problem that I 've ever heard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in believing that Carter 's prescribed means of dealing with the problem is the only-or even the best-way . From ideologues on the Republican right came the charge that Carter 's multifaceted program went too far . Insisted Martin <P> Anderson , a Hoover Institute researcher and former political adviser to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan : " The Carter plan represents massive Government intervention in the energy economy . It will lead to more shortages and higher prices , more inflation and a depressed economy . " <P> Aware that they could easily be used by Carter as foils in his drive to persuade the public to accept his program , most leaders of the oil and auto industries deliberately withheld their public fire-and ire . Said Frank Ikard , president of the American Petroleum Institute : " No segment of society is going to have everything its own way . But it would be tragic if strident divisiveness prevented the creation of a meaningful policy . " Yet from Houston 's Petroleum Club to Detroit 's Athletic Club , leaders of the most affected industries were fuming.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
