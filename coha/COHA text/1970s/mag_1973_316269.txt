Sprawled along the left bank of the Rhine River on the French-German frontier , the ancient city of Strasbourg ( pop . 250,000 ) , typifies the jarring blend of old and new that is Europe today . Thick-walled 17th century fortresses , built by the great French engineer Vauban , and a toweringly spired Gothic cathedral look down on postwar synthetic-rubber factories and petrochemical plants . Although 300 miles from the North Sea , Strasbourg is France 's largest port for exports ; Common Market-bred prosperity has all but erased old fears that the city might once again become the object of French-German rivalry . TIME Correspondent William Rademaekers recently visited Strasbourg and filed this report : <P> MADAME VICTOR STEINLE , the widow of an Alsatian wine-barrel maker , has changed nationalities five times in her long life . She was born French , but became German in 1870 when Bismarck 's army marched across the Rhine and took possession of Alsace and Lorraine . She remained German until 1918 , when the French returned to Strasbourg . In 1940 Hitler made her German again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a citizen of the French Republic . " My only wish , " she says , at the age of 108 , " is not to change again . I want to die French . " <P> Madame Steinle will undoubtedly have her wish-and if anything is certain in Europe 's uncertain ' 70s , her children and grandchildren will live and die as Frenchmen too . To Strasbourgiers , that sense of security is something new , and even a bit miraculous . " For centuries , " says Mayor Pierre Pflimlin , who in 1958 served for 18 days as the next-to-last Premier of France 's Fourth Republic , " we in the border areas have known nothing but fear and insecurity . Now that nightmare has ended . The Common Market and the concept of Europe have made a basic and fundamental change in our lives . " <P> How basic and how fundamental is immediately evident in the boomtown prosperity of Strasbourg , which has capitalized on its schizophrenic past in planning its European future . It not only exports most of its products - chiefly synthetic rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its own development . More than 26,000 Alsatians cross the Rhine daily to work in German and Swiss plants . Conversely , 10,000 Germans drive into Alsace every day , many to load up on cheaper French food . <P> Twenty years ago , Strasbourgers would have found it impossible to seek better-paying jobs in the neighboring German river towns of Kehl and Offenburg . Even vacation trips across the Rhine involved complicated visa forms and meticulous custom searches . The Common Market has changed all that . " A lot of young people in Europe take open borders for granted , " said a French customs official at the 13-year-old Europe Bridge that connects Strasbourg and Kehl . " They seem to think it was always this way . "
