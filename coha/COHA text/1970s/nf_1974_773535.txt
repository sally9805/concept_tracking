txt Will it grow in a classroom ? The upshot was that they decided to find out all they could about the human body . A group was formed to take children 's pulses . The members also wanted to know if older people had the same pulse rate as they had . One boy suggested that heart beats and pulse beats were similar . Over a period of a few weeks they investigated all these points with the rest of the class and their mothers and fathers . Members of another group investigated the pulse rates of their pet animals . Someone brought a hamster into the classroom and they found its rate of heart beat was 140 per minute . Desmond said : " I took my dog 's heart beat and it was 60 . Then I played about with it and took it again . This time it was 90 and I had to take its heart beat three times before it was back to normal . " The class started to find out if their pulse rates would be faster when they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pulses before and after moving about . In each case the rate was higher afterwards . One of the boys ran round the classroom , and this greatly increased it . " Why was this ? " they asked . They did not find the answer to this question until weeks later when the class studied the human body . In another group , Terry asked : " Is everyone 's temperature the same ? " These children were given a clinical thermometer , which they compared with the ordinary room thermometer . They used both to take temperatures , placing them under the arm rather than in the mouth , because " there might be germs . " They eventually found the difference in the ways the thermometers worked when they discovered that the ordinary room one went down too quickly after taking body temperature and you could not easily take an accurate reading . The teacher writes : 200 Worth learning There was great interest in the thermometers , and the pupils were intrigued at the way the mercury moved up . They breathed on them , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to see the mercury move up the glass tubing . They should have been allowed to ask and discover for themselves how a thermometer works , but I thought that a lesson on the thermometer at this point might be beneficial . We discussed the word " thermometer . " Why was it called this ? No one knew , but later one boy saw that " meter " was part of the word , and the class thought of all the meters they knew , gas meter , electricity meter , taximeter , and decided that it must measure something ? " heat , " of course . So the other part of the word must mean heat . The pupils realized quite easily that when the thermometer becomes warmer the mercury will move up the tube ( this they had seen when they heated the thermometer , either by breathing on it or holding it in their hands ) . The difficulty came when an explanation of why the mercury went up when heated was given to them . Expansion of solids was talked about and an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had seen this , and it was obvious from looking at their faces that many could not understand ? probably could not believe ? that solids would become larger when heated . Some would have accepted the fact because they had been told it , but others were ready to query it . It was obvious that this lesson did not succeed . Later , a bottle was provided and a balloon placed on the opening . The pupils did not devise this . It was made by the teacher and left on top of the radiator . The balloon began to fill up and this was noticed by some pupils , who immediately became interested and discussed it . They put the bottle into hot water and the balloon inflated , and later , when it cooled , the balloon deflated again . The pupils 201 Will it grow in a classroom ? concluded that the air in the jar must have become bigger when heated . The teacher constructed another piece of apparatus and left it on his desk in front of the room . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the water was moving up the tube . " It must be the heat again , " they said , so they put their hands around the jar and the level went up slightly . Later it was placed in a larger container with hot water , and the water in the tube rose rapidly . They said that this was like a real thermometer , and wondered why mercury was put in a thermometer when " water would do just as well . " They asked if they could try to make a " real " thermometer . The teacher provided glass tubing along with mercury , and a Calor gas picnic stove . Then , first heating the glass tubing , he bent it and blew a bulb at one end . The pupils showed great interest and excitement and they all wanted to try it . The following day David brought in a piece of lead piping and asked , could he try to melt this ? He said he would like to find out how many solid things could be melted in the stove flame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by the pupils that a check should be made to see if boiling point really was 100 ? C and 212 ? F. They had discovered these facts in books available in the classroom . The pupils decided that a thermometer of each type should be held first in boiling water and then in crushed ice . As boiling water was used , the teacher carried out the first part of the investigation . Because of the heat and clouds of " steam , " boiling point could not be established , but pupils said it was " at least 93 ? C. " Freezing point was checked by the pupils later . The steam seen in the first part of the experiment led to a discussion on evaporation and condensation . The pupils 202 Worth learning had not realized that water actually changed into steam . They thought this was simply given off . Together , class and teacher devised an experiment whereby a certain quantity of water would be evaporated , then condensed , to see if the same quantity of water remained at the end . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam jar full of water was put into the teapot and boiled . The condensed water produced in the top jar dropped into the lower one . This worked well in the beginning , but it was obvious that steam was being lost out of the top jam jar and out of the lid of the teapot . Presently , one boy suggested that the top jam jar had become too hot to do its job properly . There was , however , great excitement to see that the experiment did work , if not perfectly . Another pupil said that his brother in secondary school had done an experiment like this to get salt from salt water . The class discussed salt in water and sea water , and the Dead Sea and how difficult it is to sink in it . Then Diane said she felt lighter in the bath even though there was no salt in it , and Desmond said his leg felt heavier when he tried to lift it up out of the water in the bath . This led a group to experiment , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were lighter in the water . This group later went on to study floating and sinking . A small empty bottle with a screw top was floated in a large container . Then it was filled with increasing amounts of water until it sank . The rise in water level in the container that then occurred was measured , recognized as displacement , and discussed with the class , and the teacher suggested that the children might find out how much was displaced . Some of them attempted this by filling a jam jar with water , plunging the bottle in , and weighing the water which spilled down the sides of the jar . They did not arrive 203 Will it grow in a classroom ? at a definite conclusion , but thought that the weight of a sinking body was the same as that of displaced water . Another group had been formed after the very first discussion on pulses and heart beats , to find out about blood . When the class had been discussing how to measure a pulse by placing two fingers on the wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly , your hand would go white . " It 's because you are stopping the blood , " said somebody . They began to think about the color of blood . " Has everyone got the same blood ? " they wondered . DESMOND : Black people have different blood from us . TERRY : No , everyone has red blood . Iris said she could find out as she could write to her aunt who was a nurse in Africa . She did this and presently received a most interesting letter in return , which told her that dark people also have red blood . Meanwhile the discussion continued . MINA : Why do your hands get wet when you are warm ? ( Pause ) There are little holes in your skin . ROBIN : Why does blood not run out of these holes ? JIM : Because your blood is in your veins . JOHN : This ca n't be true , because you can see your veins and if you cut yourself even between the veins , you still bleed . ( The children later found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBIN : I was helping my sister to make the bed and I nipped my finger . Later it went black . DESMOND : That happened to me , too , and I pierced the black part and black blood came out . ( He thought a moment , and then went on . ) When it 's nipped maybe it stops the blood moving and it goes bad . 204 Worth learning One afternoon following this discussion , John came in from the playground having fallen and cut his knee . Before he could have it bandaged , Diane asked if she could take a sample of his blood . John had to wait while a microscope was borrowed from another classroom . A blood sample was placed on a small strip of glass and a number of pupils viewed it through the microscope . They said that the blood was " in little pieces , " " like a design " and " like a stained glass window . " ( Later they made a " Blood Book " in which they wrote about what had happened and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) While the children in the " blood group " were looking at the sample , they forgot about John , until they heard him say that the blood " had started to go hard on his knee . " Then the questions and observations started again : Why does your blood not go hard inside you ? It must be the heat of your body . How can you give blood to hospitals when it will go hard after leaving your body ? Maybe it 's because they take out quite a lot of blood . How much blood do you have ? What happens to you when you give away some blood ? Your heart makes more blood . I think food is made into blood . As a result of this , a group of pupils turned to secondary sources of information to find out more about the human body . They enlisted the help of the whole class , brought in books , especially medical books and encyclopedias , visited public libraries , and interviewed parents and relations . They did little practical experimenting but were encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest was widespread . The whole class became 205 Will it grow in a classroom ? involved as different members relayed each new discovery to the group , with great excitement . Notes were kept on the findings , and a book made . At the end of the week the members of the group were asked if they would like to take the class for a period , and report on all that they had found out . They received the idea with great delight , and immediately began to make notes and plans about speakers and subjects for the lesson . This was given the following week by Lorraine , Clifford , Philip , Albert , and Nigel . They spent over an hour talking to the rest of the class , completely without shyness or hesitancy , and using the blackboard for diagrams . Each had a subject , with one talking about the parts of the body , another on the brain , another on muscles , and two on the movement of blood . The class listened attentively and asked questions during the lesson . Lorraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull , which protects the brain , and the ribs , which protect the heart . Albert talked about the brain , which , he said , received messages from various parts of the body and then passed them out again to other parts . He said that it took one-tenth of a second for a message to go from the brain to some part of the body . At this point Harry asked if it would take longer for a message to go to the foot than to the head . Albert did not know , but an experiment was suggested to them by the teacher so that they could measure the speed of " message travel . " Eight children formed a line , holding hands . The first person squeezed the hand of his neighbor , who , on feeling the pressure , squeezed the hand of his neighbor on the other side . They timed how long it took for the action to be repeated down the line and from this estimated how long one individual took to perform it . They repeated the experiment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth learning to do it more quickly with practice , but the fastest time from hand to brain to hand they recorded was three-tenths of a second . They also found , using a similar experiment , that a message took slightly longer to travel to the foot . Continuing with the lesson , Nigel told about muscles and showed on the board how , when they contract , they pull the arm upwards . Philip and Clifford described how blood moved round the body . They said that it took oxygen from the lungs and gave this out on the way round , gathering up carbon dioxide which was eventually breathed out . The class connected an experiment with these ideas later in the term . David brought in a candle , saying he had read of the experiment and wanted to try it . He lit the candle and placed a jar over it . The candle went out . He lit it again and put it under a much larger jar , and this time it took a much longer time to go out . David said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this proved it because it had used up all the oxygen and then stopped burning . He was then asked by the teacher if he could use this experiment to discover whether we breathe out oxygen or carbon dioxide . He immediately tried to breathe into a jar to see if the candle would burn under it or not . He found that he could not successfully get a jar full of breath , so his teacher showed him how to collect it by inverting a glass full of water in a vessel of water , blowing into the glass through a rubber tube until it was full of breath , sliding a glass plate beneath the rim , removing the glass from the vessel of water , and quickly inserting a lighted candle . This proved successful and he was able to show that the candle would not burn in breath . David later wanted to know why , since we are continually breathing in " good air " and breathing out " bad air , " the layer of air round the earth was not used up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few days after the lesson , Philip brought a sheep 's heart into school . The pupils looked at a sample of the blood through a microscope , and decided that there was not much difference between that and human blood . Each pupil had a look at the heart and a number asked if they could cut it up . They found that there were four tubes leading from the top and that each led to a compartment in the heart . They concluded from their reading researches that two tubes were for taking in the blood and two were for pumping it out again . Also , David said that the shape of the heart was not like those on Valentine cards , although it did come to a point at the bottom . A pig 's heart was brought in a few days later . The pupils found this to be very similar to the sheep 's . When they had finished looking at it , it was wrapped in a Polythene bag to be taken away by the teacher , but unfortunately it was forgotten over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This started another line of inquiry as the pupils suggested many ways the heart might have been kept " fresh . " They mentioned refrigerators , among other things , and Lorraine said that sometimes animals were found in the ice , dead but not having decayed , so this must be like a refrigerator . Desmond said that the ancient Egyptians put something on dead people to keep them from decaying . A number of the children showed considerable interest in the Egyptians and began to talk about the things that were buried in their tombs . Marshall had his lunch box with him and said that this kept food fresh because it was airtight . The pupils now concluded that air must make things go bad , but it was suggested that the lunch box would not keep things fresh for as long as a refrigerator . Ann wondered how tins of peas and other things remained fresh . Presently they decided to find out how parts of the 208 Worth learning human body , including blood , were kept for use . They would do this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blood transfusion units . Pupils who were not working on this problem asked if they could write to local industries which preserved foods . ( This was essentially following up work they had begun the previous term . ) The response was excellent . The hospitals sent long letters in language suitable for the pupils , while from industries came charts , photographs , samples , etc . The following week Hilary brought a cow 's heart from her father 's butcher 's shop . All the children were amazed at the size and wanted to weigh it . They found that it weighed three pounds . The same day a chicken 's heart was brought in . This , too , was weighed and found to be ? oz . The pupils calculated that the cow 's heart was almost a hundred times the weight of the chicken 's heart ? Lorraine asked if a cow then was a hundred times heavier than a chicken . They asked butchers , found out the weights of various cows , talked about " live weight " and " dead weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hens . One of the people they had written to was a sausage manufacturer , who sent , among other things , some posters advertising his products . They put these on display , and after a few days , a pupil noticed that one of them showed a vacuum pack containing bacon . They added this to their growing list of ways of preserving things . The next day Desmond came into school with a small vacuum flask , wanting to know if this would keep things fresh . However , it was an old one and he did not know if it were working at all , and this started some of the children discussing how they could find this out . So , in fact , they completely forgot the original idea , to see if it would keep things fresh . Next day , Iris brought in another flask and compared the two , but then decided that both might not be 209 Will it grow in a classroom ? working . After this , the children put hot water into each flask and into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other pupils brought in different types of containers , such as lemonade , milk , ink , and medicine bottles ; two large dried milk tins ; and jam and large sweet jars . They filled nine of these containers ( leaving the lid off one of any pair of similar ones ) and the two flasks with hot water , and took the temperature of the water in the eleven vessels each hour . Earlier , they had asked if they might make charts about the results ? meaning block graphs , which they made last term ? and they had discussed this and designed and put a block graph on each of the eleven vessels . The temperature record was on the vertical scale and time on the horizontal . The experiment worked very well and they finally decided that both flasks were working , because they kept the heat in . The children talked again about vacuum flasks but could not decide how they worked . They looked in dictionaries and found the meaning of " vacuum . " David brought in a washing-up liquid container , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top back on . It stayed " squashed-up " and he wondered if he had created a vacuum inside . The water was left standing in the nine containers other than the thermos flasks , and all were in the classroom . The children took the temperatures the following day and found they were all in the range 58 ? 60 ? F. It was suggested by the teacher that they should take the temperature of the room , and this was found to be 60 ? F. After much discussion , they decided that the temperature must fall to that of the room . Diane then asked what would happen if the water were below room temperature . She brought in ice cubes and placed them in the water . Its temperature fell to 45 ? F , but on the following day it had risen to 58 ? F. 210 Will it grow in a classroom ? David then asked why our body temperature did not drop , since we were normally 98.4 ? F and the room was about 60 ? F. The teacher put this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why we wear clothes . " Another suggested that the reason why pygmies wore very few clothes must be that the temperature in their country was over 98.4 ? F , and another that the Eskimos had to wear so much because they lived in so very low a temperature . This revived interest in a topic that had barely been touched on in the first week of term , when the children were talking about why we catch colds in winter : the various ways of keeping warm . As a result of this , they made two friezes in their art classes , one depicting how other peoples keep warm and the other about keeping warm through the ages . 212 The heart hears .. . and speaks The cultivation of the senses , feelings , and imagination Herbert Spencer used to say that if archaeologists a hundred years hence unearthed one of the schools of his day , they would probably decide from studying its curriculum and methods that it was a training institution for monks and nuns . If a comparable study is made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for programming computers rather than a place for nurturing the growth of children . Lately , however , teachers have been groping towards teaching that does touch the emotions , sensibility , and imagination . They are trying to provide educations for human beings . 213 Will it grow in a classroom ? Simply sharing feelings ? in a relaxed , supportive setting ? can be the start of a more human classroom and school . In fact , it is a start which can carry a group of children and teachers quite far into the realms of authentic communications , as Arlene Uslander and her colleagues found out when they began a discussion program on sex education ( and other problems ) in an otherwise very traditional school . BY ARLENE USLANDER " I 'm not talking today , " Kenny stated flatly , as he entered the room . " Kenny 's just angry because he had to do a paper over again , " Debby explained . " He was in trouble on the playground ; he left his library book at home , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What seems to be the matter , Kenny ? " I asked . " I hate school ! It 's too hard . I have to get up too early in the morning . I do n't understand the teacher . She always yells at me . I never do anything right . I 'm in the lowest reading group ; I 'm in the lowest math group . I 'm probably even in the lowest lunch group . " In this angry statement , Kenny expressed not only his own frustration , but the frustration felt by many children struggling to reach goals that adults have set for them . At the age of six , and only in the first grade , he was already experiencing failure and rejection . By comparison with his peers , he found himself lacking , and instead of being encouraged by praise of his strengths , he was usually chastised because of his weaknesses . Naturally , he was resentful . He recognized ability grouping ? no matter how subtly 214 Worth learning disguised ? for what it was , and both he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to rise above the level at which he had been placed . Greg said : " Oh , Kenny , it 's not that bad . Look at me . I 'm absent an awful lot because of my asthma . At first , I thought I 'd never learn to read , but the teacher helped me . She gave me things to do at home , and told my mother how to help me . All you have to do is ask her . " " I ask her ! I ask her ! But she 's always busy . " " You know something , Kenny ? " Debbie said . " You ought to try harder . The teacher has a lot to do and she ca n't always listen to you . Sometimes you 're not very polite to her . You talk back to her . I like school ! " " I 'd like school , too , if we had computerized teachers , " declared Steven . " Why ? " I asked . " So we could pull out their plugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Besides , you have to go to school . If you do n't , you wo n't learn to read , or anything , and then what would you do ? " " I could play all the time and watch television as long as I wanted to and be able to stay up real late , " Kenny answered enthusiastically . " That would be great ! " " I think people should be born grown-up . Then they would n't have to go to school , " Steven said defiantly . " The part of school I like best is going home . " " That would be silly , " argued Debbie . " We 'd miss all the fun of growing up and learning . " " What fun is that ? " Kenny asked angrily . " All we ever do is work , work , work . . . Sometimes I wish I was still in kindergarten . " " What was fun about kindergarten ? " asked Richard . " All we did was play . We did n't have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . I hate staying in school so long . " 215 Will it grow in a classroom ? " What did you think school was going to be like before you came here ? " I asked Kenny . " When I first started kindergarten , I wanted to go to school , " said Kenny . Nine surprised faces , my own included , stared at him . This was certainly a reversal . " Five years with my mother was enough ! " he exclaimed , a mischievous gleam in his eye . " Everyone kept telling me I 'd learn to read and write in school , " Richard said , " and I was disappointed . In kindergarten , all we did was play , and it was so short . I was bored . First grade is much more fun . " " I knew you 'd say that ! You probably like Sunday school , too ! " accused Kenny . " I do n't go to Sunday school . But if I did , I think I 'd like it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I started , " said Greg . " The older boys told me all about it . They said the teachers were mean , and you had to put your head down when they told you . They said the teacher spanked you . But my teacher has n't spanked me yet . The kids must have been trying to scare me . School has n't been anywhere near as bad as they said . And first grade is better than kindergarten . At least we have recess in first grade . " " I remember when we just started first grade , " said Joseph . " I thought we had to know how to read already . Boy , was I scared . I felt like throwing up . " " You think that 's so bad ? " said Steven . " I wet my pants ! I was so glad when we were finally able to go home . The whole time we were in school , I did n't think I 'd ever see my mother again . " " I was lucky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I started . My mother is a teacher , and I have a brother in college . They told me everything . I did n't even have to come to school if I did n't want to , " she continued . 216 Worth learning " I knew how to read and write and everything , but my mother told me not to tell anybody , because I would get into trouble . So I forgot it all before I started school . " Richard shook his head , a puzzled expression on his face . " How could you do that , Sandy ? " he asked . The idea that someone could forget what he or she had learned seemed inconceivable to him . " It was easy , " Sandy said , casually . " I did n't really learn it so good to begin with . " " You know the first thing I made when I came to school ? " asked Steven , who had turned his chair around and was now sitting astride it , as though he were riding a horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , the worst thing was remembering what all the bells meant , " recalled Greg . " I jumped out of my seat every time they rang , and one time I got into line for recess and it was n't even recess time . I still forget sometimes . " As I listened to the children comparing notes on their very first recollections of school , I realized that they were beginning to view with amusement early experiences , which , at the time , had seemed very unpleasant ? perhaps even traumatic . Joseph 's next comment was a good example . " Do you know what happened to me ? " he laughed . " The second day of school , I went home at recess time . When I heard the bell , I thought that school was over . The principal had to call my mother to bring me back . Boy , was she mad ! " " I kept forgetting the gym teacher 's name , " said Greg , who had ? on more than one occasion ? called me " mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different names . " " It 's hard to remember where you 're supposed to go , too , " Susan pointed out . " Yesterday , I was supposed to go to my speech class , and on the way there , I forgot where I 217 Will it grow in a classroom ? was going , and had to go back to the room to ask the teacher . But I like going to speech . I have fun there . " " I wish I could go to speech . Then I would n't have to do work , " interjected Kenny , who was still in a sullen mood . " The music teacher is nice . I like it when she plays records for us , " mused Joseph . " I pretend I 'm a conductor leading a big orchestra and everyone has to watch me before they can do anything . " " That 's sissy stuff , " shouted Kenny . " Well , I like it ! We do n't all have to like the same things , " Joseph said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked Laura , who had not yet expressed an opinion on this subject . She thought about my question for a few minutes and then , instead of looking away , as she so often did , looked directly at me . Very quietly , she said : " I like to come here . " " Why ? " I asked , anxious to hear what this child , who spoke up so rarely , would say . " Because it 's . . . because you 're . . . you 're so nice to all of us , " she said , finally . " And you 're honest ! " added Steven . " That 's what I like . Yesterday , we were drawing winter pictures . Mine was terrible , but the teacher said it was beautiful . She did n't have to do that ! I know you would n't . " I could see that Kenny also wanted to say something , but for once was holding back . " How do you feel about coming here , Kenny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry I 'd questioned him . He surprised me . " I wish we could stay here all day , " he said . " You do n't yell and you do n't make fun of us and you never make anyone sit in the corner or stand in the hall . " " But I 've asked you to leave the room several times , when you disturbed us by making noises , and falling off your chair . Or when you would n't give anyone else a chance to talk , " I reminded him . 218 Worth learning I did n't like to ask a child to leave the room , and did so only on the rare occasions when one of them ? usually Kenny , unfortunately ? demonstrated that he or she simply could not settle down . We had such a short time together each week that I did n't like to deprive any one of us of even a moment of it . When one of the children kept bidding for everyone else 's attention in negative ways ? interrupting , making fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would ask that child to remove his chair from the circle , telling him that he could rejoin us when he was ready to follow the one rule we had in our room ? a rule which the children , themselves , had decided upon : Only one person talks at a time . Naturally , there were moments ? especially when the discussion was particularly exciting ? when everyone , myself included , forgot about our rule . And it certainly was never my intention to maintain an " it 's so quiet you can hear a pin drop " atmosphere . But from the very beginning , I tried to instill within each child a respect for the other person 's right , desire , and need to talk . The child who denied others this right , as Kenny sometimes did , would be asked to leave the group temporarily . And if sitting outside the circle did not produce the desired effect , the offending child was asked to leave the room . I wondered whether Kenny felt that I , like some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . My question was answered when he said : " But you always said I could come back when I was ready , and I could sit in the lunch room or go back to my classroom . At least I did n't have to sit in the hall , where everyone would stare at me . " " I had to sit in the hall once , " recalled Sandy , " and I kept wishing the floor would open up and I could crawl into the hole . " " I spent so much time in the hall when I was in kinder-219 Will it grow in a classroom ? garten , I was beginning to think I lived there ! " Steven admitted . The children 's comments had long since taught me that they enjoyed coming to our " corner of the world . " Frequently , they said such things as : " Ca n't we stay longer ? " ; " Do we have to leave now ? " ; " Ca n't we come more than once a week ? " ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of People class ? " And once , the whole group surprised me by coming into the room and sitting down after the dismissal bell had rung . " We want to study people after school , too ! " they informed me . They always rushed eagerly into the room in their haste to start talking , and lingered as long as they possibly could when it was time to leave . Perhaps Joseph expressed the feelings of the entire group when he said : " In this room , we can relax . In this room , we can be free . " Most of them tended to attribute their positive feelings about our class to me ? to the fact that I was " nice to all of them and did n't make fun of them , " that I accepted each child as an individual and listened to what each one of them had to say . But I tried to show them that they , too , were helping to create the atmosphere they so enjoyed . They , too , were beginning to accept and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each other 's place and ? in so doing ? were developing a feeling of responsibility towards one another as human beings . When they were in third grade , I had to be absent from school on two occasions , and both times they met alone ? without any discussion leader at all . From several teachers who had walked past the room during their sessions ? and , of course , from the children themselves ? I learned that they had carried on with their discussions just as though I had been there . They were learning how to deal with one another even without an adult 's supervision . I could n't help feeling gratified . 220 Worth learning Dan Cheifetz 's free theater workshop for an integrated group of neighborhood eight ? elevens gave the children " the means , the encouragement and the freedom to be themselves , to learn about themselves and to express themselves .

One girl stood near the entrance and vigorously scratched her arms and legs and sometimes her back . A neatly dressed boy came in and went to a corner of the gym . He stood exactly where the side and back walls met , slouching and staring solemnly at his shoes . Another boy picked up a basketball that was lying around and shot a basket . His friend got the rebound and dribbled away . Two girls went up on the stage that occupied the far end of the gym and began to play house . One served tea to the other , using a battered table and bench that were there . The high-ceilinged gym was drafty and the heating system occasionally made clinking and sighing noises . So began my workshop in dramatic play and learning . The children , ten girls and five boys , aged eight to eleven , were to meet thirteen successive Saturday mornings for an hour and a half at the Metropolitan Duane United Methodist Church in New York City . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to play and perform but not so much space that it would be difficult to round them up and concentrate them in one place when necessary . 221 Will it grow in a classroom ? I gathered them together now , asking them to sit on the floor around me . They dawdled on the way , reluctant to start , or rather , pretending elaborate coolness about the whole affair . Finally they sat , keeping careful distances between themselves and anyone they did n't know ; at the same time , they stole curious glances at one another . I told them very briefly about what we were going to do in the workshop : play pretend games , act out things , pantomime , improvise ( I explained that ) and other activities that I hoped would be fun and also help them learn . I asked them to stand up if they knew the game Simon Says . They all stood up . I said this would not be the usual " put your right hand on your left shoulder " kind of Simon but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures . I would be Simon first , then give them a chance to be Simon . " Simon says , Spread out and give yourself lots of room . ' " They did . " Simon says , ' Be a tightrope-walker ! ' " The boy who had stood by himself in the corner before we had begun now was standing directly in front of me . He threw his arms out at right angles to his torso and planted his left foot carefully behind himself . Slowly he swung his right foot around and placed it at a slightly toed-out angle directly in front of himself , his whole body wavering and swaying in a well-imagined move-and-countermove struggle with gravity . He brought his left foot around , then the right , then more quickly the left again . He stopped , almost fell , righted himself , and got set to move forward again . This was Brent , a ten-year-old black boy from a Chelsea tenement . He certainly did not look like the same boy who had slumped in a corner , staring at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a poised and graceful figure , his eyes wide open in concentration on an inner world in which he was 222 Worth learning fifty feet off the ground while thousands held their breath beneath . " Simon says , ' Be a snake ! ' " Immediately Brent was off the swaying tightrope and onto his stomach , hissing and writhing on the floor . Another snake , a leggy , pretty , eleven-year-old white girl named Sally , hissed at him . Brent blinked at her , hesitated , then hissed back , hard . Sally smiled delightedly and hissed again . Then both stared at an entirely different creature , not a snake at all , but a person playing on a pipe and rolling her eyes . This was Margie , an imp-faced black girl of nine . Simon could n't tell her what to do . She had decided not to be a snake but to control one . A sinister cobra was rising on the mysterious music of her pipe . It was Margie 's friend , nine-year-old Joyce , wearing a colorful robozo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicked in and out and her head turned like a pig-tailed searchlight , looking for a victim to strike . But before she could find one , Simon had said , " Be a monster ! " Cobra forgotten , Joyce rose and clumped about , neck and face rigid as a monster , but arms held out more like a scarecrow . Suddenly , a girllike squeal came from her , and she ducked away . A light-haired boy monster , ten-year-old Stan , was approaching fast . Actually , monster Stan had not been after Joyce but his friend , monster Richard ( my son , a curly-haired nine-year-old ) . The two Frankensteins clutched each other and prepared for a **27;364;TOOLONG match . But , just in time , Simon had said , " Be pigs ! " And Stan and Richard were in the mud together , snuffling and oinking . Richard turned over on his back , bent his hands slightly at the wrist , held his legs stiff in the air , and 223 Will it grow in a classroom ? rolled luxuriously from side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig were one . A plump , auburn-haired ten-year-old named Sandy was watching him . A while before , when we were sitting together in a circle , she had been at the edge of the group . Now she was laughing at Richard 's piggish roll in the mud . Then she leaned against the gym wall and began to rub her back against it , up and down , back and forth , her eyes closed in piglike pleasure . But not for long . " Simon says , ' Be a dog ! ' " Sandy went to her hands and knees , then her haunches . She had been the one scratching herself when the other children had wandered in . Now she incorporated her nervous habit into her role : she vigorously scratched her fleas ! Near her was a frightened-looking boy dog , a towhead named Donald , who had just turned eight . Throughout the game , Donald had been copying the actions of his ten-and-ahalf-year-old sister Stacey , as if we had been playing Follow the Leader instead of Simon Says . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit . Donald tried to follow but his way was blocked by a big mastiff with bared teeth . This was Carrie , a sullen-looking black girl of eleven . The big dog barked threateningly at the little one . The pup tried to bark back but his opponent was so big and fierce , tears came instead . Seeing his distress , his big sister left the rabbit chase and came bounding back to the rescue . But just as she arrived , the mastiff had reared up and become a light-footed vision of gentle grace who would n't have hurt one of Sandy 's fleas . Tricky Simon had commanded : " Be a ballet dancer ! " No question about it , a game 's the thing to get children involved in a new activity . Their desire to have fun playing the game overcame their social anxiety . Once they got into it , this game generated its own security and belongingness. 224 Worth learning When they were inside the game , they were inside the group , and so could relax their fears . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wildness and little silliness cropped up , because playing the game by the rules is self-disciplining . The children themselves would handle any unruly player who disturbed the ritual of playing . Playing this special kind of game also helped overcome the children 's reluctance to commit themselves to this new group , because it helped define the nature of the group . It was n't a class or a club ; what was it ? Simon and his magic transformations began to answer that question . He also made it fun to be part of the group , whatever it was . And seeing one another do interesting and funny things was a good way to satisfy their curiosity about one another . Other things were happening too . Take Brent again . Just by looking at him gracefully defying death on that high wire , one could see how much he was involved in what he was doing . His whole body , and his inner sense of his body , were involved in an imaginative re-creation of how physical equilibrium is maintained , lost , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have seen such an artist in an actual circus or on television . And maybe his own private dreams of glory , as well , were represented on that high wire . Children often pretend to be someone more powerful or heroic than themselves in their private fantasies . The difference is that , perhaps for the first time , Brent had a chance to become his fantasy in the flesh . And he had moved his fantasy out of himself and into public view . So often a child meets with a patronizing attitude , or even contempt , if he reveals his secret life to adults . Normally , Brent would have been afraid of being laughed at if someone " caught " him pretending to be a high-wire artist , 225 Will it grow in a classroom ? or acting out any other cherished dream or weird story he might have told himself . If his fantasies are held in low esteem by the adults who guide him and whose love and acceptance he needs , he can not possibly esteem them very highly himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall off his acceptable " real life " from his secret , made-up one . But on that imagined high wire , Brent 's fantasy life and real life become one . By encouraging him to play out his fantasy , and by praising his public expression of it , we can begin to break down the psychic wall between his " real life " and his secret one . In this way , his secret fantasies become more available to him as a source of creative power in his everyday life , rather than a part of himself to feel guilty about and reject . Children are often made uneasy by adult questions like : " What are you going to be when you grow up ? " Or : " What do you like to do the most ? " Though they are natural roleplayers and experimenters , such questions and the attitude they represent may make children feel they would be more acceptable and loved if they could more clearly define themselves : as an aspiring fireman or nurse , or someone who likes only to play marbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and definition in a single role , or in a very limited number of roles , and discourage them from trying new ones . Experience in role-playing , such as our game of Simon Says , helps counteract this pressure to specialize too early and validates the child 's natural inclination to experiment . Another benefit is that by trying on different roles ? like hats , to see if they fit ? a child may discover elements in himself he did not know were there . A boy like Brent , who sits himself in a corner to wait for someone 's instruction before he moves , probably never thought of himself as poised or graceful or brave . But he 226 Worth learning could not be so skillful playing a high-wire artist unless he too had some of these gifts . This role is a way for him to discover new qualities in himself that his everyday life might never have given him the opportunity to sense . Simon changed Brent and the other children into snakes and dogs and monsters , as well as heroic tightrope-walkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however imperfectly , with a creature completely different from himself . He had to seek in his own imagination and experience for some inner connection , some understanding , of such a creature . Since he has identified with it , he may thereby be motivated to find out more about it . Certainly he has stretched his general capacity to identify and imagine . " I am not sure that I ever had a happier impulse , " says Frederick Buechner about his experience of simply and silently enjoying a sunset with his students . BY FREDERICK BUECHNER Late one winter afternoon as I was walking to a class that I had to teach , I noticed the beginnings of what promised to be one of the great local sunsets . There was just the right kind of clouds and the sky was starting to burn and the bare trees were black as soot against it . When I got to the classroom , the lights were all on , of course , and the students were chattering , and I was just about to start things off when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter dusk , and on impulse , without warning , I snapped off the classroom lights . I am not sure that I ever had a 227 Will it grow in a classroom ? happier impulse . The room faced west so as soon as it went dark , everything disappeared except what we could see through the windows , and there it was ? the entire sky on fire by then , like the end of the world or the beginning of the world . You might think that somebody would have said something . Teachers do not usually plunge their students into that kind of darkness , and you might have expected a wisecrack or two or at least the creaking of chairs as people turned around to see if the old bird had finally lost his mind . But the astonishing thing was that the silence was as complete as you can get it in a room full of people , and we all sat there unmoving for as long as it took the extraordinary spectacle to fade slowly away . For over twenty minutes nobody spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the near-dark and watched one day of our lives come to an end , and it is no immodesty to say that it was a great class because my only contribution was to snap off the lights and then hold my tongue . And I am not being sentimental about sunsets when I say that it was a great class because in a way the sunset was the least of it . What was great was the unbusyness of it . It was taking unlabeled , unallotted time just to look with maybe more than our eyes at what was wonderfully there to be looked at without any obligation to think any constructive thoughts about it or turn it to any useful purpose later , without any weapon at hand in the dark to kill the time it took . It was the sense too that we were not just ourselves individually looking out at the winter sky but that we were in some way also each other looking out at it . We were bound together there simply by the fact of our being human , by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there through the window , and by our curious significance in face of what was going on in there in that classroom . The way this world works , people are very apt to use the words they speak not so much as a way of 228 Worth learning revealing but , rather , as a way of concealing who they really are and what they really think , and that is why more than a few moments of silence with people we do not know well are apt to make us so tense and uneasy . Stripped of our verbal camouflage , we feel unarmed against the world and vulnerable , so we start babbling about anything just to keep the silence at bay . But if we can bear to let it be , silence , of course , can be communion at a very deep level indeed , and that half hour of silence was precisely that , and perhaps that was the greatest part of it all . Wanda Gray 's reflections on how she " generates creation " in her classroom of ten- and thirteen-year-olds reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find myself singing the same song over and over today as I get ready for my first class . The wind is coming down the road , The sun is shining and the sky is blue . The wind is coming down the road , The sky clouds up and there starts a weeping snow . There 's another verse , but I ca n't remember it , so I sing the same one again . It only became a song yesterday . Before that it was a poem , written by nine-year-old Tom on a piece of blue paper . A volunteer teacher comes in with his guitar , and we start the song again . As the children come in , they sing , too . Then we sing some other songs they 've written . 229 Will it grow in a classroom ? Blue is bright . Blue is light . Blue is a color , like no other . Blue is the mountains , Blue is the sea , Blue is the sky we look upon . Blue is you and me . That 's 11-year-old Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music is beautiful , and we sing it twice , appreciating the universality at the end . " Let 's sing Neils ' , " somebody says . We do , and Neils sings loudest , beaming . I like cloudy days , They 're so nice and cool . And on sunny days , I feel like jumping in a pool . Or shussing through the powder , La la la lala la-a-a ! I like almost all days . " Let 's sing a different one . . . Ann 's . " I walk in the woods , Where the shade is deep , But the sun shines , softly , On the pine and the aspen trees . Hers is long and we only know one verse , so she rolls out a long piece of newsprint and starts to copy the words for us . After Ann 's , we sing the many verses of 10-year-old Saga 's , belting out the chorus : Oh , I want to be a grownup , Over twenty-one . I want to be a grownup , They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " somebody says . Another child , leaving with the guitar teacher to finish his composition , 230 Worth learning leans back in the door to call , " I need a flute and a drum , " and two others go with them . Our class is rolling . Saga has written a myth about how the world came to have colors , and now she is directing it as a TV play to be videotaped . She and her actors start to practice the play on one side of the room where two girls are already lettering the credits and scene changes . " Let 's decorate the signs , " one says , and they begin drawing pictures around the words . At the opposite end of the room , four kids are making a sound and light show , using colors with sound and music to create various emotional effects . " This is angry red . " " No , I think it 's war . Blood and war . Let 's use part of Dr. Zhivago , that thundering part . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some birds singing . " " I think green is more like peace . You know , that yellowgreen when the leaves first come out in Spring . " They are using solid colored slides in a slide projector and taping bits of music from a stack of records . The arguing and negotiating is constant as they work . One boy is looking at a book of art reproductions , a girl is rummaging through the prop box selecting costumes for the play , and another boy is reading Moby Dick in a corner . A well-dressed lady visitor comes in . " What do you do in this class ? " She chooses the boy who is reading , perhaps because he is doing something " normal . " He looks up , " Well , right now we 're playing around with color , " he says , and starts to read again . I hear another boy 's half-growl , " Shoulda said we 're making a color bomb . " He has picked up the apprehension in her voice , and he and I exchange smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being observed , then leaves . If she thinks we are playing around with color , she is 231 Will it grow in a classroom ? right . By now , someone may be making a color bomb , too , I think to myself , for we never know quite where we 'll go from our beginning . The beginning that led to today 's class took place about a week ago . What I mean , here , by beginning is a planned experience , shared by a whole class , that provokes response , reaction and questions to stimulate the kind of self-motivated creating and exploring described above . Many teachers decide to stop being dispensers of knowledge and become resources to kids . It 's an important change . If made effectively , it can give kids much experience in thinking creatively and using resources . But often , in changing their practice , teachers become frustrated and discouraged . Some common complaints are : " They do so little , they do n't need a resource ! " " If I let them do what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have any strong interests . " " Their behavior has gotten awful , and they still do n't express their feelings . " " They just run from one thing to another and destroy things as they go . It 's chaos . " These teachers , in effect , are saying , " I want to change , but the kids wo n't let me . " They are waiting for the students to somehow spontaneously involve themselves so the teacher can be a non-directive resource . I have yet to see that happen . Although the responsibility for learning belongs with the kids , the teacher is still responsible for the way he teaches . That is his art . He must still design and structure . My approach is to first generate purposeful activity by designing and leading beginning experiences . When the children become caught up in exploring , questioning , and creating , I no longer need to direct and I can become a useful resource . Whatever was created or discovered during our beginning experience is used for further exploration and learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through creating and using the creations , in being stimulated by one another 's feelings and ideas , and in seeing their own ideas and creations stimulate other people . I do not grade the children 's work ; I acknowledge and appreciate it . Mistakes are challenges for further work , not " black marks . " Let me describe the beginning that led , over the course of a week , to the class described above . In preparation , I gathered pieces of paper in all the colors and textures I could find . In class , I said , " Everybody sit in a circle on the floor and close your eyes . " They sat quiet , eyes closed , and I said softly and slowly , " Listen . You hear a color . Hear it ? It is close to you . You are becoming that color . Breathe it in . It is going to your toes , up to your knees , up your legs , all through your body to the tips of your fingers and the top of your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe it out . You are that color , and nobody else knows what the color is . But you know and you feel the color , because you are the color . Softly , open your eyes . Colors are raining from the sky . " Pieces of paper I had dropped were floating to the floor . " Find your color , or one you like , and write anything you want on it . " Everybody wrote ( including me ) , then we read what we wrote aloud and passed the colored papers around and read and commented on each other 's . Two of the songs quoted above were written , as well as many other descriptions and comments . We laughed and talked and admired each other 's work , and considered the questions and ideas that came up : " What if there were no colors ; everything was black and white . I 'll bet it 'd hurt your eyes if you saw colors ! " This was Saga and later she explored her idea in the play she wrote . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw was red . " This and similar comments inspired the light and sound show experiment . 233 Will it grow in a classroom ? " I was scared when I was blue . I was this icy , icy blue and when people saw me their blood ran cold . My blood was cold , too , and all my hair stood up . " We talked about being scared . " I am deep , soft purple . I wrap around and hold things , and love them . When light hits me I shine , and I like it when I am in a play or on the costumes of kings and famous people . Sometimes other colors are jealous of me , but I can just melt and cover them all , so I do n't mind . " We talked about loving and feeling jealous , and then about colors that are usually associated with jealousy and love and of other color symbolism . I told them about The Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick and one of the boys told about reading Invisible Man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes scratches when she plays . Like yellow . " We talked about animals and other things that make us think of colors . " I am dark , mean red . I creep up on things and squeeze them till they are mean and red like me . " We talked about feeling mean and whether or not we feel " squeezed up " inside when we feel mean . The writing is full of personal feelings . We question and talk about them , but we do n't analyze or make judgments . We looked at the pictures around the room , some our own and some reproductions . Looking at a Gauguin print , Gail said , " I like that picture because it has a red dog . I mean , if the dog was brown , it would just be plain , not any good at all . " Turning to a Lautrec poster , she continued . " I do n't like those green and yellow faces . The people look sick or something . Why did he make those . . . ghouls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know this woman who has pink lights in her house because she says it makes people look pretty ! " 234 Worth learning This conversation went on until suddenly Tom announced that he 'd written a poem but it would make a better song . Humming , he went off to find the guitar teacher to help him compose the music , leaving all of us rereading what we 'd written to see if , perhaps , ours were songs , too . That was a beginning . I call such experiences beginnings because reaction and response begin . Whatever follows can not be planned by the teacher . It is the child 's own , with no right answers . The teacher can , and should , provide media through which the responses can be expressed and he can acknowledge and accept responses , but it is the child 's questions and reactions that determine the action and creation . For example , I did not foresee , when the children sat on the floor and became colors , that poems , songs , plays , a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things would come from the experience , and I did not assign any of those projects . But they did n't " just happen . " They happened because everybody was interested in the experience , and each had a chance to communicate what he thought and felt about being a color . Nobody was cut off or ridiculed , every contribution was accepted as worthwhile by the entire group . Every question and comment was regarded as a possibility for further exploration . For example , when Robert said , " I wonder if you could make people mad if everything they saw was red ? " I said , " I do n't know . How could you make everything red ? " Comments came from around the table . " If you had a big red light , everything would look red , " someone suggested . " We do n't have a red light , " another said . " Use a projector , and put a red cloth over the light , " the first responded . " Yeah , " said Robert , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a classroom ? " I 'll bet we could . Let 's try it . . . wan na help me ? " turning to a friend . Three kids wanted to help , and in the course of " trying it , " they figured out how to make slides using colored gel and decided to use many colors , not just red , to see what would happen . Every project evolved in a similar way , with no assignments from me . My job , and that of the entire group , was to respond , probe , make suggestions , provide materials , and to be ready to go in any direction . During the next three weeks , we continued to talk and explore as we painted and drew , colored with felt-tip markers and crayons , and branched off into separate projects . We became aware that it 's difficult to look at colors in isolation and , on one child 's suggestion , went downtown and looked at the color schemes of different places . We tried to figure out such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnut furniture and an elegant French restaurant had red carpets , gilt furnishings and white tablecloths . Someone asked why most schools have drab halls and white classrooms , and we made some changes in our own school . We read the color poems from Hailstones and Halibut Bones . We also had several other group experiences to reinforce the beginning one . One morning , full of crazy energy , we all danced to music , becoming vari-colored autumn leaves , floating wildly through wind and storms and finally resting in a heap on the floor , waiting for the winter snow . Another morning , feeling quieter , we blocked white paper into four equal parts with masking tape and , while soft music played , we each painted our color impression of ourself and three other people in the room . After that , we tried to guess who each picture was , and talked about why we had used the colors we did for each person . Then we took the masking tape off and tacked the pictures to the wall as a reminder of 236 Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in relation to color . Each experience helped us to feel and see color in a different way . Meanwhile , individual projects were going on and generating other work . Finally , we capped our exploration of color . We finished the play and videotaped it , using some of the color songs as part of the soundtrack . We finished the sound and light show and gave it in a school meeting . Some of the poems appeared in the school newspaper ; some decorated our walls . The songs were used in a movie about the school . The color myth inspired several other myths and plays , not about color , which we dittoed and made into an illustrated book . The book was a present to a class of younger children , and some of our group went every day for a week to read it to the little kids . We had felt and explored color , used our creations , and were ready for new adventures . Demonstrating the usual progression , our work with color had unfurled through a three part process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the entire group . ( 2 ) Communicating , exploring , and creating from the experience , done together and individually . ( 3 ) Using the creations . In planning beginnings , the idea is to use objects and concepts that are already familiar , but to see these and our feelings about them in a close and different way . We magnify , take apart , and play with the experience and our responses . The experience should be physical and sensory : we have to use both our bodies and minds in order to experience it . It should be dramatic and stimulating enough to provoke sensations and questions , but not so threatening as to inhibit the expression of whatever was felt or experienced . It should be open-ended , so that we can see it from many points of view and take it in many directions : there is no one right answer . A sense of daring to go into 237 Will it grow in a classroom ? the unknown , of adventure and expectation should be heightened by the experience . Ideas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in reading , in watching and hearing other teachers , in creativity tests ? and when the time seems right , I modify them to fit the children I 'm teaching . Here are a few beginnings designed to heighten sensory awareness , particularly vision , hearing , and touch , and to increase the ability to communicate quick , unusual , and apt analogies , which many researchers see as the most accurate determiner of creative ability . ( I use other beginnings for problem-solving and body movement and have , with some modifications , planned beginnings to explore math , science , and social studies in useful and creative ways . ) Blindfolding is a dramatic way to focus on sight , or the lack of it , and it brings to the surface quick , strong feelings . An exciting beginning is to explore the school while blindfolded : the classroom , the halls , and outside , the yard . All the familiar places suddenly become strange , maybe dangerous , full of surprises , and a little scary . When we do this , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice the only link with the familiar world of authority . All else relies on the hands , feet , and body of each child . Their feet clutch the ground , their hands and arms become antennae . After we 've tried the swing and the slide , explored the fort , lost our way , bumped into strange things , recognized familiar ones , and listened and felt until our bodies strain , we feel our way back inside , rip off the blindfolds , and write . This beginning goes in and out of our conversations , writing , drawing , and reading for the entire year and we experiment with it in many ways . Some kids do it again , with other friends . Two kids come to class blindfolded every day for a week , keeping a diary about losing their 238 Worth learning vision . We all blindfold ourselves to see if we can identify each other , or we try to identify objects that we pass around . Once we went to a Braille Nature Trail blindfolded and tried to identify the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages with our fingers . Again , we had a " taste test , " trying to identify a dozen or so tastes while blindfolded and holding our noses . Sometimes we close our eyes and listen intently to music or the random sounds around us . Almost the opposite of being blindfolded , or removing sight , is to focus vision closely on one object . We have a beginning the children call Trying to See What You Did n't . This consists simply of collecting interesting objects , taking them one at a time and seeing them every way we can . For instance , I place a rock in the middle of the table and say , " What do you see ? " Everybody looks . Somebody turns the rock over so that it looks like a shelter and says , " A bug house . " Another says , " A giant jewel , " and holds the rock archly to one ear . A boy giggles , " A birdbath for hummingbirds , " turning the rock again to show an indented spot . Responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . a petrified cloud . " By this time everybody has held the rock , it has been listened to ( " Earplug for a giant with insensitive ears " ) , felt ( " Paperweight or doorstop " ) , and even tasted ( " Tongue-sharpener , or sharpener for birds ' beaks " ) . I continue to give objects as long as there are requests for more . Sometimes I offer a situation with the object . " You are alone in this room and it is empty . Your job is to decorate it and all you have is three million of these . " I produce a large silver safety pin . Laughs , groans , they pick it up and hand it around . " I would hook some of them together into chains and hang them at the windows and doors like those beaded curtains . " " I would put a big stack in the corner 239 Will it grow in a classroom ? and we could slide down it . " " Melt some for a sculpture . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Use them for toothpicks when you have guests . " At some point during these suggestions , one will catch our fancy and we pause for a conversation , and our ideas flow into action . We explore objects further by using pantomime , which is an excellent medium for heightening vision and awareness , for in it the mime has to be aware of how he looks to others . Here , an object is passed around our circle as we sit on the floor , and each person , in turn , pantomimes a different function of the object . A hat may become a steering wheel , a frisbee , a wash basin , a mirror , a mixing bowl , a treasure hugged and hidden from the rest of us , or a container with a strange and magic essence inside . Sometimes , instead of having a real object , the first person will pantomime an action with an imaginary object . When it is recognized by the next person , it is passed to him . He continues the action until he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts pantomiming using a yoyo . The second transforms it into a bouncing ball . The third bounces the ball a few times and pops it into his mouth : it has become a ball of rubbery gum . The next person takes it , chews awhile , then pulls out a long strand , which he starts to play with a bow , like a onestringed violin . This play with objects is a physical way of making comparisons and analogies , and almost immediately similes and metaphors related to the experiences begin to appear in children 's writing . Briefly , a few other beginnings : Collect commanding-looking faces from magazine pictures , take them to class and " read people . " Become the character for a dramatic improvisation . Use a Polaroid camera to make pictures of just hands , feet , or backs of heads of people in the class . How can you tell who they are ? 240 Worth learning Make your own musical instruments and try to " talk " to each other with just the instruments . Pair off and give instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much do you rely on hearing to communicate ? How much on sight ? Sit , facing one another , and express with just your face such words as " hungry , " " hate , " " angry , " " love , " " happy , " " cold , " " revenge . " Try it again , standing and using the whole body . Tape short , representative excerpts from eight or ten different musical genres : electronic music , Bach , Mozart , rock , Dixieland , jazz , a country instrumental , a popular song . Play them and ask one " unanswerable " question with each : What is this place ? What is happening here ? What kind of girl is this ? What kind of day ? Jot down responses , then tell why you heard as you did . Intentionally , the ideas I have suggested for beginnings are sketchy . Fleshing them into dramatic , stimulating experiences appropriate to specific children is a design job for each individual teacher . As you start to design beginnings , look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical , sensory experience . Then ask : Is the experience open-ended ? Stimulating ? Safe enough ? A little daring ? Can my students relate to it . . . does it fit them . . . is it already part of their lives ? If you answer yes to these questions , you have a good beginning . If you can also insure open , respectful communication , can encourage questions and ideas , and are willing to venture with kids into strange places , you are likely to generate truly exciting exploration and creation . In the process , you may find yourself less often handing down static information and beginning to serve , instead , as an instigator of experience and a useful resource to the creative work of children . 241 Will it grow in a classroom ? Fights in the classroom , hurt feelings , and even deaths are openings for dramatic plays or discussions that explore children 's feelings and help them deal with anxiety . Here , the death of Martin Luther King , Jr. , caused grief and tension . Miriam Wasserman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " mourn " through a homemade drama . The subject is social studies ( as a response to history in the making ) . The technique is improvisational dramatics . And the message is : teachers do not need a " confluent-arts " program to teach to the heart ! BY MIRIAM WASSERMAN It was in I.S. 201 , just then the center of the whole city 's fury , and it was the day after the M. L. King funeral . A group of girls in a domestic science class started a play , being ladies talking about King , the funeral , peace , nonviolence , etc . They acceded to my request that I be an audience , even starting again from the beginning after they had seated me . The play quickly became a discussion in which they revealed the fears and anxieties aroused in them by the murder , the subsequent rioting in Harlem , and violence in general , I suspect , including the violence and general disorder of the school . They kept referring to King as a man of peace , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in Africa . " In order to point out the resistance rather than simply the nonviolent element in King 's philosophy , I asked permission to be in the play " for just one question . " They gave it . Other kids started to gather around and wanted to contribute . At first the original cast would n't let in outsiders , saying they could n't talk because they 242 Worth learning were n't " in the play . " I asked if they could n't be in the play , and they said , " No , ' cause she was running around . " Eventually you could earn entrance into the play by sitting around quietly and listening for a bit . By the end of the hour the entire class was either " in the play , " or listening . What we had then was an organic group , not a coerced one created by the teacher . It grew out of a common pressing concern , whose consideration was initiated by one or two natural leaders and which took a form which , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal involvement . ( They were using a bowl of artificial flowers as pretend grown-ups ' refreshment , although of course some of them had M &M's,; etc. , in their pocketbooks and pockets , and from time to time as feelings would begin to rise precipitously , the " hostess " would jump up and pass the artificial flowers around with little simpering ladylike murmurs and smiles . ) At the end of the hour there was a kind of relaxation in the room which suggested that some gratifying catharsis had occurred . I do n't know that I contributed much to the process . Possibly the following : ( 1 ) I did n't try to take over the class , so at least I did n't prevent it from happening . ( 2 ) I perhaps gave the proceedings legitimacy by attending them myself . ( 3 ) I may have helped the nucleus grow by asking if other people could n't be in the play . But I 'm not sure this would n't have happened anyway . On the other hand , I am pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , I would have smothered the whole thing . ( 4 ) Maybe somebody got the political message that King was murdered not for his nonviolence but for his resistance . I think with more experience , I could have developed the technique of helping a concerned nucleus grow and then leading the students to new insights . I would of course like 243 Will it grow in a classroom ? to see some other teachers try it . I 'm beginning to believe that that 's one of the most important legitimate functions a teacher can perform , maybe the only one . Ron would like to add a few words about love : If you have thought much about education , you probably have an ideal image of teaching and learning . For instance , Plato 's ideal was mature men discoursing , seriously but joyfully , over ample food and drink . Comenius ' was an enlightened schoolmaster opening unformed young minds to the light of revelation and science . For Montessori it was a community of children in an environment responsive to their awakening powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've always been attracted by Pestalozzi 's simple image : Gertrude slicing pieces of bread for her children . As each child comes up to the table Gertrude slices just the right amount , because she knows how much each child likes this kind of bread , how big an appetite each has , how well they ate at the last meal . Here is the poetical inspiration , the gravid myth , which underlies much of our 244 Worth learning recent school experimentation with " individualization , " where this means adjusting the curriculum , the matter to be " covered " or mastered , to the capacities and interests of each student . Translated from physical to temporal terms , it becomes " going at your own best pace " through the curriculum . Translated from quantitative into qualitative terms , it becomes permitting different students to master the same basic material according to their different learning styles and predilections : rote drill , physical manipulation , didactic instruction , multi-media presentation , collaborative learning . Still , it 's the same loaf being sliced , though our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as matter , and to slice even according to the eater 's personality and tastes , as well as his appetite . But suddenly , today , at an ice-skating rink , I was struck hard by another image ? as hard as Pestalozzi 's had struck me when I first read it . A woman was being taught to skate by a man who swept her over the ice with his arm around her waist . In love , they glided around together , she carried along ? by him , by their speed , by the fearlessness of being held expertly , and , I suppose , by the fact that 245 Will it grow in a classroom ? learning to skate did n't really matter , compared to the by of being with him , so close . Because they were going so fast , she really could n't stumble , and by moving just as he did , she learned ? through a kind of combined empathy , imitation , contagion , and love . The erotic blended with the didactic , of course ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once . He stopped , they laughed a lot , he helped her up , brushed her off , kissed her , they kissed again , laughed , then clumsily got back attached and started skating again . Nothing had been lost by the mistake , it was just as pleasurable as the successful skating . If anything , it was an added delight , because it put them , momentarily , in a slightly altered relationship , always a pleasure for lovers : she looked slightly different , sitting on the ice , so he saw another little aspect of her face , her figure , her spirit . And they had a chance to laugh , kiss , brush off . Gertrude 's eye was keen , her mind clear , her heart open , and her knife sharp . But if we need all the love we can get , and hunger , too , always for growth in our lives , then we had better make our learning a part of our loving . 246 Other ways No teacher can escape asking then questions : Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools be reformed ? Are there alternatives ? At this point a myriad of new ways of teaching have been explored . But a few teachers , together with students and parents , are beginning to go beyond innovations in classrooms and schools . They seek other ways than schools to learn and to grow . Schools without walls , voucher systems , the " deschooling " proposals of radical critics like Ivan Illich and Paul Goodman ? all of these raise some basic questions that every teacher , no matter how committed to working within the existing framework , must now face . Does the teacher , no matter how dedicated , run the risk of doing more harm than good ? Are there feasible alternative ways to learn ? Will it grow in a classroom ? John Holt wrote the following letter in response to an invitation from the National Association of Elementary School Principals requesting that he participate in a symposium on educational alternatives . Holt expresses his doubts about entering into such a discussion and states his reasons for feeling as he does . ( If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified by what happened at the symposium , the transcript appears in the April 1973 issue of the Association 's Journal . We were two of the participants , and in our opinion , Holt was right about what would happen ! ) BY JOHN HOLT Thank you so much for your letter of 16 November . I have some doubts about attending your meeting , and I think the best thing for me to do is to try to explain as concretely as possible what they are . What troubles me about the present discussion on educational alternatives is that people seem to me to be trying to find alternative ways of doing what the schools are now supposed to do , but are obviously not doing very well ? that is , getting large numbers of people to learn what other people have decided will be good for them . It is this fundamental notion hidden in the word " education " that I now have to reject . My position is a good deal more radical than merely saying that the state should not have the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that it is the proper business of the state , at least one that calls itself democratic or free , to tell anyone what he should know or learn . I fear that this discussion may start from the premise that schools 250 Toward teaching ? and beyond are not doing a very good job of teaching everybody the things that they should know in order , as the popular saying goes , " to function in a technological society , " and that we must therefore find other ways . I altogether reject this notion of the proper function of any kind of educational resource . The only educational resource that I will recognize as legitimate is one that helps people learn whatever it is that they may happen to want to find out . So I 'm very much concerned and distressed with anything that limits access to what is already known , or to people who can do things . In the case of medicine , medical knowledge , and medical tools , Illich has put it very well when he says that we must learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case of children learning to read , I do not know why we can not put a lot of the kinds of information now only available in classrooms on the sidewalks and walls and windows of our streets and buildings and public spaces . It is not just poor children but poor people of every age who do not have access to reading material . In a poverty stricken area of a large city , there are practically none of what my neighborhood is full of ? branch libraries , drugstores with a big supply of magazines , bookstores , and so on . I am interested in the idea of mini-libraries in storefronts or in converted trucks or school buses , using mostly newspapers , periodicals and magazines . Beyond that , I am even more interested in the idea of a free press . We are so used to thinking in abstractions that we think " freedom of the press " means the right of people who own newspapers to publish whatever they want in them . But it initially meant something much more concrete than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to print yourself whatever it was you wanted to say . Modern technology now makes this fairly easy . For very much less than what it costs to build a classroom ? indeed for a small fraction of that cost ? we can put into each neighborhood a 251 Will it grow in a classroom ? multilith press and associated equipment that would make it possible for the people right in that neighborhood to produce their own neighborhood newsletter ( what in older times used to be called broadsides ) about whatever interests them , or to prepare texts on many subjects for all the people in the neighborhood , including children and students in schools . I read all the time that schools in poor neighborhoods are in a bind because they do n't have enough materials , because they can not afford to buy the expensive materials commercially produced . Why not give them the power to print and distribute their own materials to their own communities ? This is the sort of thing that interests me and that I would like to talk about . Herb Kohl has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in our cities there is a big outcry about it . Great campaigns are waged against graffiti ; all kinds of threats of fines and so on are made . This seems to me to be a step in exactly the wrong direction . It is easy for people with money to get access to ways of making their ideas widely known . Why should it be so hard for people without money ? Why should n't there be a great deal more than there is in the way of public bulletin boards , or spaces deliberately prepared for graffiti writers ? The kind of thing that Herb Kohl had when he was running the Other Ways School . Some of the things I have suggested are the kinds of things that people in a community , a community as small as a single block , might be able to do if every family in that block had the $500 or $600 or $1000 that the schools spend , and exceedingly badly , on each of their children . A multilith offset printing press does not cost very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a small part of what we spend and misspend on schooling children , and more and more on providing guards and police protection , we could make available ? quite literally 252 Toward teaching ? and beyond to every block ? tape recorders , photographic equipment , language tapes and texts , various kinds of laboratory equipment , and so on . But people might not choose to spend their money this way . They might prefer to spend it on travel , music or musical instruments , or I do n't know what . In short , I would like to expand enormously our definition of what we understand by educational resources , and not just limit them to those items that would help people learn out of school the kinds of things now being taught in school . I 've done an immense amount of self-educating since I left school twenty-nine years ago , and none of it has been in classes or with school textbooks . Thus a textbook is almost by definition a book that nobody would read unless he were compelled to . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys , games , puzzles ? the kinds of things that rich kids get for Christmas , use for a week or two , and then put away in a closet somewhere ? Paul Goodman wrote more than once that there was probably nothing that could be done that would be of more educational value to people growing up and living in New York City than to ban cars , trucks , and buses from most of the streets . We hear people say all the time that if the children were n't in school they would be on the streets . The streets of a good city , or of a healthy community in a good city , are one of the most exciting and fertile educational environments that men have ever invented , which is why people left the farms and the small towns to go to the cities : There was such a greater variety of people there and things to see and things to do . If in fact we have made our streets unlivable , unusable , and dangerous , and not just for young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the streets of a community are so dull and boring and so unsafe and crime-ridden that the schools are truly better places to be , then the children of 253 Will it grow in a classroom ? that community are not going to learn much even in their schools . The schools , whether public , independent , parochial , alternative , storefront , or whatever , can at best only add to and enrich what a person learns in the community and streets he lives in ; they can not make up for it or undo it or reverse it . In this connection , I would like to urge with all possible force ? and indeed I think I would make it a condition of my taking part in such a symposium ? that all participants read and ponder what Jane Jacobs has written in her book , The Death and Life of Great American Cities . She talks eloquently and hardheadedly about what the streets can do and can be and how they can once again be made safe and interesting . And we might talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more available to people as a resource . I 'm not talking here about things like the Parkway Project , which is just fine for the 700 students who are able to attend it ? out of the 10,000 or so who applied and the I-don't-know-howmany hundred thousand students in Philadelphia . I am talking about making much better directories of the city and what is in it and making them much more widely available ; about systems of street signs and transportation signs that will make it much harder for people to get lost ; about reducing ( or eliminating ) the cost of public transportation so that people , and particularly poor people and young people , can make full use of it . There is an awful lot going on in most cities , a hundred times more than could ever be put within the walls of a school building , even in pictures or slides . We need to think of a community , and a community of communities , in which it will be much easier for people to share what they know , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably already written more than I would be 254 Toward teaching ? and beyond able to say in the entire length of a symposium , which makes me wonder whether such get-togethers , with all their expense and inconvenience , are really the most efficient way to generate ideas and get them spread around . Still , if you had n't asked me I would n't have written this letter . Anyway , this gives you an idea of where my thoughts are and the kind of things I want to talk about . So if there is some substantial overlap between my current concerns and those of other people you are thinking of inviting , we can certainly pursue this matter further . Some of the people you are inviting are good friends of mine , and it would be nice to see them . There is always the possibility that we might strike sparks off each other and together think of things that none of us have thought about singly . So my mind is still open . Voices from the oppressed sometimes echo Holt 's despair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Side . BY FRED GONZALES I am pro education but I am anti school . School is a heartless gamble with young people 's lives . Our young people are looking for a new way of life and finding only a way to survive . My name is Fred Gonzales . For many years I have lived on the Lower East Side with my brothers and sisters . I 've been in school for 11 years and only have begun to read and write at the age of 16 . There are many reasons for this and I 255 Will it grow in a classroom ? will try to explain . One is that my parents did n't have sufficient education to teach us and it was up to the school to do it . In all this time all they 've taught me is " Freddie you 're stupid and you 're never going to learn anything . " They said " you 're illiterate , you 're never going to amount to anything , you 're wasting our time , quit . " For a long time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at what was really there , and realized you 're only recognized by your 90 's and 80 's . Anything below that and you are an outcast to the school system . Many times I have found that teachers become psychiatrists and if you do n't react and just sit in your corner you get a pat on the head and told " he 's a nice boy , I wish all my students were this way . " But if you 're loud and rowdy you 'll find in your records that this child is a " disciplinary problem " who probably will end up dropping out of school and going to the streets . I know , I was that cat and I had to face the reality that in order for me to survive I had to read and write . And during that year that I was out of school and in the streets I learned more than I ever had in my whole school life . Many other young people may never get the same opportunity . If educators do n't start re-educating themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer in reading machines and new ways of educating they will continue to cripple the people instead of serving them . Education to me means a door to open and if you want to walk any further you can ? it 's your choice ? it should never have ratings or averages . But you should have some way of measuring what you 've learned . It should n't be a race you 're forced to join if you do n't want to join . It should n't be something pounded into you ? it should be free and most of all it should be a choice . They should make it a family type environment and not a competition . Then we would have one thing in common ? to explore learning . We 're not going to hold back 256 Toward teaching ? and beyond because we 're ashamed . There should be a lot of sharing ? like " what did you get out of that book . " If I could share my experience with one other person , teach him what I 'd learned , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not living . Schools do n't allow new reading machines . They do n't use anything that will make learning faster . They want some to go to the top but they want some to stay on the bottom . I tried to rap to some of the guys about school about what they are doing and trying to tell them that their only road is school . In order to fuck the system you have to join it . Education is the true revolutionary gun to free our oppressed people . They can stop you and shoot you for throwing bombs but if you stop and think about it your greatest weapon is that pen and piece of paper and all the knowledge you can get . Jim Aufderheide expresses the confusion that so many teachers feel today . These teachers are brave enough to know that none of the old answers will work , but they are unsure of what comes next . BY JIM AUFDERHEIDE We 've got a problem , and we 're not alone . Last year , as a first year teacher , I taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amazed at the apparent apathy of the student body toward education . Nothing " turned them on . " Mistakenly , as I now perceive , I blamed it on the traditional type system , and the people 257 Will it grow in a classroom ? in it . We tried many of the traditional methods , some new innovations ? a little bit of everything . Nothing got those kids moving . I moved to Apollo School because I had heard it was one of the newest , best , and most innovative in Minnesota , and I think it is . They try here . Each department continually tries new methods and approaches . The curriculum is examined quarterly . Scheduling is examined yearly . Emphasis is on the student : What does he need , or want ? How can we fill his needs , or wants ? What can we do to make education more meaningful , more worthwhile ? The building itself houses perhaps one of the best facilities in the Midwest . We have the equipment , supplies , books , and supportive personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educational need . The most practical and relevant , and we 're trained to use the stuff . Each faculty member has his own office , and free time to spend helping students , just being with students . Stress is on helping them to learn on an individual basis . But something is missing . There is even educational apathy here ? towards school , towards education , towards learning , towards success in anything . It 's the same I 've found in the " best of both educational worlds . " And from discussions with educators in other areas , and other fields , it 's a common situation that is spreading . We 've spent many hours trying to find the problem . Are teachers to blame ? Are n't teachers capable of reaching students ? Are we doing something " wrong " ? Is it the school ? Was our beautiful facility misplanned ? Curriculum ? Scheduling ? Environment ? But it 's none of these , or all of them . Society , the world , 258 Toward teaching ? and beyond has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to attain the changed goals have changed . Education does not seem to be , to these kids , the way to achieve those things important to them . Success , as we see it , is no longer important , is no longer success . Achievement is so commonplace it is no longer a goal . We 're used to it . The world has achieved the moon , the sun , artificial organs , and artificial life in these kids ' lives ? plastic , changing people in a plastic , changing world . Toffler 's " storm " of change is upon us in all its fury , and it 's touching everyone , and everything . To a world that has been desensitized to achievement , other things have moved into the needed place of importance . Peace , a clean world , personal , inner happiness , a self concept , a quiet place in the midst of the storm ? these have moved into the limelight now . The kids want life . Students feel they have the skills to survive ; perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to know , as the need arises . Too many college graduates are jobless . Too many high school graduates are without jobs . Perhaps their reasons for not wanting or needing the type of education we are offering are valid . Priorities have changed , and the type of institution we are using no longer fills the bill . Perhaps the type of education we are offering is no longer relevant . We have n't found a solution . We 've been shocked by the realization that we , and our system , might be obsolete . We 've had a difficult time convincing ourselves that the things we 've been teaching , and enjoying , might not be necessary . Perhaps we 're wrong . We 're searching for alternatives . I wonder if anyone , anywhere really knows . . 259 Will it grow in a classroom ? Hal Lenke found one answer that is suited to his own needs and those of his community . He calls his answer " teaching less . " It is a model mainly because it suggests that we , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our personal situations . " The way of the masters was to find their own way . " BY HAL LENKE For two years I have been a teacher-at-large ? at large in the sense that criminals or wounded or rogue animals are spoken of as being at large . For the two years before that , I was a teacher positioned , located , a classroom teacher , a teacher-at-small . I was a teacher , in a classroom , in a school . My first year on the job , I yearned to be one of my students . I was confused in my role , seditious in my loyalties . It was confusing to my students , too . All they knew of me was that I , like all the other teachers they shuttled among , had a big desk and was paid to blare into their privacy , to tinker with their impulses , and to teach them . I , of course , did n't want to see myself that way . I wanted them to know I was with them ? but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I gained any strength , first for myself as a person with them , and then for myself as a teacher who could be their advocate and justify what I was doing . My first year 's lesson was : accept the power you have , and use it . But I found other lessons equally informative . One of the operational root assumptions behind public education is that it is a collective , public , democratic enterprise , and everyone is involved in a common benevolence toward the 260 Toward teaching ? and beyond well-being of the individual children . So-called anecdotal report forms , guidance counselors , testing , evaluations , which call upon a teacher to express his ( intimate ) feelings and sense about a child with whom he shares a class are predicated upon the central thesis that all who avail themselves of such materials do so in an enlightened way and will apply them to the best interests of the child . But this is a deceit and an invidious seduction . For to pour out what you really know about a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied in such a benign way , often merely consigns the child to an inescapable label . To make such material available to the file folder , the dossier , the computer , the machines of continuity charged with the tracking of the child , is irresponsible and destructive , and yet it is at the crux of what is required of teachers . How many teachers characterize their students this way , fill in the forms , and violate the indescribable status of a personal relationship ? So the child is treated as a game , ephemera , without meaning to you ? for to the extent that the person had meaning you would be unable to fill in those blanks . Such obvious things as that dawned on me in flashes through the year . My revelations were mundane , vulgar , yet they nourished me . So much recent school reform forgets that school is part of the society , and that each person who comes to it every morning is a multi-faceted carrier of that society , its culture , its latent deviance . School is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aggregate population without correlations . It 's a short-circuited organism , a disordered molecule . I was interested in questions other than those promulgated by the administration . For instance , do the kids behave differently in the classroom when I am out of the room ? How are the combined irritations , daydreams , enthusiasms of thirty people manifest in a classroom period ? 261 Will it grow in a classroom ? How do my own patience and moods , my own generalizations , get reflected to the students ? To what extent can/ should a classroom period transcend the constraints of being in school ? To what degree is it doing a disservice to high school kids to be so different from their other teachers ? How can I be a learning specialist ? What is there to be learned in a classroom ? First of all , there are the concomitant lives of thirty other people . That is the shared-time-and-space reality . There is the headknowledge , the abstractions , information , theories , and ideas . There is body-knowledge , the fact that all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passive , pliable for seven hours a day . ( Though television has eased that burden : they wanted me to entertain them , polished productions , clever commercials , and all . ) Then there was the woman teaching a Problems of Democracy course : the first thing she told her class was that there would be no discussion . Eventually , I lost my job . That is , I left the classroom . Jonathan Kozol : " The school that flies the flag is .. . accountable to that flag and to the power and to the values which it represents . " So what of the teacher who defines himself in the terms of that school , which is defined in the terms of that flag , which is defined in the terms of that power and those values ? If all you are is a teacher , in those terms , you ca n't be doing any good . The professionalization of the function denatures it . All true teachers ? gurus , maestros , masters ? have been adepts , practitioners , disciplined embodiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise of experience . But if you do not permit yourself experience growing toward proficiency , fluency , outside the pronouncements and postures of pedagogy , your teaching is vacant ; it lacks authority because it profoundly lacks authenticity 262 Toward teaching ? and beyond the authenticity of one who can tell the tale because he came back from the adventure . Only such a one can replicate the experience for his cohorts . He has scanned the experience for its sources , its intent , its implications , its consequences , its modification , its applications , and he can lay it out for examination and analysis . That is part of the lecture I gave myself periodically . Professional teachers are often accused of being ineffective because they have not been able to make concrete what they have " internalized , " so they convey their own conclusions and ask their students to accept them as premises , without knowing whence they derive nor where they tend . A learned thesis is personally defensible because of its apprehended closeness . The professional teacher too often keeps the tenets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into formalizing their exterior guises . Thus , they are never learned , and never truly at the service of the student . The classroom is less distended if the teacher 's presence is a connection that could be made any number of ways , and finding themselves in this room now is a happy accident for which students and teacher have both prepared . A teacher gives himself , gives himself out , expends himself , becomes expendable . If there is no chance of a teacher being excelled by his students , he is holding out on them and should be deposed . It is easy to fix on the teacher : the teacher is the student of his students , attentive to each . His authority comes from realizing that knowledge can not be withheld . His teaching is a style of learning . A teacher gives other people back to themselves , he returns them , turns them around , turns them on , turns them out finally to face their changes . The teacher restores wholeness , unifies fragments , enabling energy to go beyond its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own wholeness. 263 Will it grow in a classroom ? So I am striving to be a teacher-at-large , which is something other than being an unemployed teacher at loose ends . While he is in the classroom ? most classrooms , perhaps not all ; most of the time , perhaps not always ? the teacher is an extract of a person . The new teacher acknowledges his limitations , to himself and to his audience . The new teacher disavows any educative imperative : it is all right , he assures us with his whole manner , he will not be out of a job if you do n't want to study this now , if you disagree , if you have a different style . The new teacher encourages diversity , uniqueness , interplay . The new teacher does n't have all the answers . The new teacher has his own inklings , intimations , hints . He may reveal them , he may teach in parables . The teacher 's teaching will be accounted in how he handles himself , and in what comes of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An effort to codify and instrumentalize it may not be a step forward . But we might try to describe features of it . One function of the teacher is to reveal , to exhibit . The teacher is an exhibitionist : he does a thing , he performs an operation , he displays , uncovers , disrobes , decodes , unhampers , and by this process he makes something accessible that was n't before . " A man is n't what he seems but what he desires , " wrote Adrienne Rich in a recent poem . There is so little one person says directly to another . It seems to me that we should be showing people how to learn without us , but that makes us crucially important while we 're with them . Are teachers learning specialists ? Not the ones I 've known and worked with . They 've thought remarkably little about learning , remarkably little about what is " best " for either their students or themselves . 264 Toward teaching ? and beyond In our clumsy reckoning , the most advanced sovereignties institutionalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic effects . The societies we think of as more backward and underdeveloped acknowledge their violences with far more openness . Thus , the civilizing process is one of masking fundamental traits . Its dissemblings are maintained by a sophisticated despotism . So with individuals , nations , classrooms . Instead of presiding over a vicarious world , a teacher might become part of an actual community . I am living in a rural West Virginia county . With 2500 students in the schools ; about 25 percent of the high school graduates go to college , mostly state colleges . In some recent attempts to affect local practices , I realized that I was turning for assistance to the parents of that 25 percent , when in fact there was nothing more than amenities that they could desire from the system . It was the other 75 percent that I wanted to assist . Is it the missionary impulse , this being an ombudsman-oncall , a " learning resource , " a teacher at large ? Is it what Jacques Ellul calls " The Political Illusion " ? that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern careerist dichotomy , dividing us as recklessly as the mind/body dilemma split schools of philosophy . Is a teacher a moral/spiritual force , or is he a political organizer ? Or something else , a cross between a " child advocate " and a " technician of the sacred " ? some rare mutation out of the ordinary dust ? A teacher must be intelligible , must acquire a native approachability . That has occupied my time for the past year . The teacher at large that I would like to be depends in part upon hard thinking and strategy and in part upon happy coincidence . To be of use to people , they must first see me as usable to them . That 's a very different mandate from the one imposed upon the classroom relations . 265 Will it grow in a classroom ? The teacher-at-large that I am groping for is a teacher of and to his community . His motto is to rise to the occasion . As a financial proposition , he might either open up shop the way a doctor or lawyer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in exchange for services or goods . Or , he might be paid from a community fund . It is important that he not be exclusively dependent on any factional payroll . He might incorporate an agency , with a board of community people who would provide suggestions and guidance on priorities . Specifically , such a teacher would do research for people and bodies of the community , from town government to a bank to the Chamber of Commerce to the school board to a farmer to a woman on welfare . He would obtain information , or show others how to find out what they want to know . Things I have done include writing interviews with the school board candidates for the county newspaper , the first time anything like that had been done . I was invited by the superintendent of schools to talk to the county principals about ways of using non-school people to help students . I have proposed ways to use the library as a community resource , reading to children on Saturdays , getting volunteers together to tutor children there , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired people 's group to talk to them . I am interested in challenging the license renewals of local radio stations whose programming does n't contribute anything to the population . I am talking with people about establishing a learning resources exchange such as exists in a number of places around the country , to provide instructional companions in a variety of areas . I am working on developing an apprenticeship program with local craftsmen and women . I am in touch with people who are interested in marketing co-ops , in child care centers , and in youth centers ? none of which we have now . 266 Toward teaching ? and beyond It is slow . I have just been called for the first time to do substitute teaching , and that opens up all the old sores . I have substituted in second and third grades , the first time I 've taught in an elementary classroom . I am beginning to talk with some of the thirty teachers in the county who are teaching for the first time this year , to implement in a more concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am talking with the local doctors about people 's nutritional problems , and with lawyers about the problems they see , and with ministers , mothers , old people , mechanics , grocers , and with people who defy classification . That 's a large part of it . I am not talking about some deified teacher . I am really still mired in old Movement terms ? talking about being a " change agent , " a provocateur , a catalyst , a facilitator , and so on , words that were romantic but never meant much to me . If I call being occupied this way a teacher-at-large perhaps it is just an excusable extravagance of my saturation with the vocabulary of schooling . Here I am , amidst what Sylvia Ashton-Warner in Spearpoint calls " the agitation of the race itself , " and , as she says , we have no words for it . Other people are doing the same thing in other ways , certainly . That is what some of them mean by " open classrooms " ? although I think no classroom can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is what some mean by " free schools " ? though there is something of a contradiction in the phrase . All those things we were told about being a teacher that beguiled us , all those epiphanies about affecting eternity , all the fantasies about " helping " little children , have brought us up against our own bedrock capacities . Finally , we see where we have been evasive with ourselves . Finally comes the test of what we have learned ? survival and love must not be irreconcilable . We have finally undertaken to teach ourselves all that our education darkened . That is 267 Will it grow in a classroom ? what we shall be occupied with for the foreseeable future , inspired by each other , sharing what we can , eager in our work , filled with life . Some parents who have the time and credentials are opting to " grow their own " ? return to the traditional mode of educating children at home instead of sending them to school . Art Harris is one of these enterprising and articulate parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one small step toward de-schooling society . " One of the two children is unusually gifted academically , the other is more social , but Art feels the experiment has been successful for both . BY ARTHUR S. HARRIS , JR . Elsewhere , in magazines like Outside the Net and even in the Sunday supplements , I 've chronicled how Phyllis and I , both one-time teachers , became so disillusioned with public schools that we just had to withdraw our two boys at the end of their fourth and sixth grade years and oversee their education ourselves . Rather than go over all that ground again , I 'd like to move on to how we 're doing . First , who does the teaching ? Frankly , we do n't have much teaching . We believe that children learn best what they want to learn when they want to learn it . Too often adults actually get in the way of learning . Taken to its infinite end , one could wonder whether schools with all 268 Toward teaching ? and beyond those instructional hours do n't sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Phyllis was a part-time public school " art teacher " as recently as last year . I put " art teacher " in quotes because Phyllis brought up all manner of subjects in her disadvantaged schools . Auditing art supervisors and principals loved it . So what if she showed slides of our trip to Japan or arranged to bus a class to see maple syrup being collected ? The children were interested , were n't they ? My own full-time teaching , in college and prep school , ended some years ago . But both of us began to question increasingly the structured establishment in which we taught . Were people being " taught " or did they " learn " in spite of us ? So we sit back and let our older son Kevin read . For six months he read almost nothing but books and articles about astronomy . For awhile he got hooked on the American Revolution after seeing the play 1776 ; then he got back into the A 's again with astrology , architecture , and archaeology . They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we to dictate a child 's interests ? Our youngest child , Clifford , who is no reader , is always taking engines apart or building something or fixing a leaking radiator in my car . Is this learning ? Why not ? Since he has more " personality " than almost anyone you 'll meet , we recently were gratified to learn from the Christopher Jencks study that personality ( along with luck and graded performance ) had much to do with success in life . Our own children seem to learn without that omnipresent teacher . Probably Professor Louis Agassiz demonstrated this in the way he taught his student , Nathaniel Shaler ; he had poor Shaler spend over a hundred hours examining a fish without telling him anything about the fish . He wanted Shaler to learn for himself . In the same way , we feel the most important thing is for a child to learn 269 Will it grow in a classroom ? how to learn . The trouble with school is that too much is " taught . " Too often a teacher is positioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that material . Curriculum : The word is anathema to us . If we laid out a course of study for our sons , they 'd surely feel they were back in school again with those narrow subject areas of history , English , geography , and math . Sometimes I get the idea that the mere defining of a subject is the first step toward robbing it of its mystique . When Kevin is reading about some archaeological discovery in Mexico , he is n't consciously thinking , " Now this is archaeology . " In the truest sense , subjects all fuse with one another . Once Kevin became absorbed in Transcendental Meditation ( and took a college credit course in it at Queens University in Kingston , Ontario ) , he began to delve into psychology , religions other than Christianity , the culture of India , mysticism , even elementary Sanskrit ? all sorts of things , almost none of them offered in school . Who are we to fence in his learning with narrow subject areas of math , history , English , and civics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knows nothing whatever about corruption in the Harding administration , probably does n't even know a man named Harding was ever President . But I 'll bet he knows more about the American Revolution than anyone on our block . Is this bad ? And if you tell me he is n't becoming well-rounded , I will show you most of his school contemporaries ( I probably should slip into jargon and call them his " peer group " ) who know nothing of architecture , archaeology , astronomy , or astrology ( just to take the A 's ) , to say nothing of zen , penology , psychology ? well-rounded indeed ! Social Life : It 's the same as before : Kevin , our introspective reader , is still a loner without friends as he was throughout the first six grades . Clifford , our gregarious one , 270
