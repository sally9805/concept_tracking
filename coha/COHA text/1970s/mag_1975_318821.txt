WWII <P> by JAMES JONES <P> Designed by ART WEITHAS <P> 272 pages . Grosset &; Dunlap. $25 . <P> <P> If Viet Nam was the first televised war , World War II marked the coming-of-age of photojournalism . The frontline cameras of Edward Steichen , Margaret Bourke-White , W. Eugene Smith and Robert Capa brought that war home in living-and dying-black and white . So powerful a messenger did the camera become that it overshadowed the ancient craft of combat artists . <P> Now , during the 30th anniversary of the end of World War II , the men who went into battle with brush and pencil can finally be fully appreciated . Drawn from U.S. Government archives , this collection of more than 160 sketches and paintings recalls such familiar dogfaces as Bill Mauldin 's Willie &; Joe and George Baker 's Sad Sack , as well as the efforts of many unknowns . Most of the work is by Americans who seem to have been undergoing a collective hangover from the Great Depression . Their styles range from bitter caricature through gritty social realism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Allies is curiously missing , but a smattering of pictures by Japanese and Germans is included . There is even a painting of a town square , allegedly done by the young Adolf Hitler in the manner of an arthritic Utrillo . Yet distinctive styles did emerge from the chaos and mud . Kerr Eby , a professional artist who had also sketched the fighting in World War I , turned smudged charcoal into Miltonic scenes of darkness made visible . Howard Brodie 's slumping G.I.s are stark icons of bone-weary courage . Brodie , who was a sergeant attached to Yank during the war , went on to sketch such peacetime battles as the Chicago Seven trial and the Watergate hearings . In The Two-Thousand-Yard Stare , LIFE Artist Tom Lea caught the essence of battle fatigue . <P> Tropic Lightning . " I 've seen men with that look on their faces , " writes Novelist James Jones of Lea 's picture . " I 've had it on my own face . " This intense involvement with the illustrations elevates Jones ' text well above the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off the art work . <P> Jones , of course , lived many of these experiences . As a Regular Army enlisted man , he was at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 . As a corporal with the 25th ( Tropic Lightning ) Division , he was hit by shrapnel at Guadalcanal . As he made his bloody retreat to an aid station , Jones recalls , " the thing I was most proud of was that I remembered to toss my full canteen of water to one of the men from headquarters company lying there . " <P> This quiet , embattled camaraderie is the book 's dominant-and winning - tone . Because he was one of them , Jones pays respectful but not sentimental attention to the ordinary Joes who did the fighting , suffering and dying in both theaters of the war . He alludes to distant political decisions and grand strategies when his story can not avoid them , but his tale is really a loose collection of vivid details : the cheery wave he received from a low-flying Japanese pilot on a strafing run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo plane pilots during the battle of Midway ( " No Japanese kamikaze pilot later in the war ever went to his death more open-eyed or with more certain foreknowledge than these men " ) .
