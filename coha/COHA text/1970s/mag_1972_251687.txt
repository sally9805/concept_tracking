I. Fearless Fosdick Faces the Pentagon <P> FEW officials in Richard Nixon 's Washington are held in higher esteem as masters of governmental management than is Elliot Lee Richardson , 52 , the next Secretary of Defense-even though almost no one can adequately explain just why . The public Richardson is stuffily Bostonian , serenely confident , vaguely remote . His set speeches are bloodless and dull . His ad-lib language is so convoluted , yet grammatically correct , that one questioner at a Senate committee hearing jokingly confessed that he could not quite tell from a Richardson answer whether he was for , or against , drug abuse . Moreover , Richardson has been appointed to so many high posts ( five in the past 15 years ) by appreciative Presidents that he has rarely been able to finish any task he has tackled , leaving no clear record of concrete accomplishment . <P> Yet everywhere the nomadic Richardson moves , the morale around him seems to rise . The men with whom he works most closely consider him not only warm but witty . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable-and rare-capacity both to retain intricate detail and discard unproductive trivia , keeping basic goals in focus . His aim at HEW , he explained , was " to get away from the hypnotic absorption in tending the machinery and to look outward at what is happening to people . " Richardson not only contends that HEW , which has 280 programs and a budget larger than that of the Pentagon , can be managed but also that he proved it in his two years as its head . His associates tend to agree and praise him further for lifting spirits in a department staffed heavily with liberal civil servants largely antagonistic to Nixon 's conservative social policies . Some do fault Richardson , however , for too blithely accepting Nixon 's rejection of both his plans for prompt school desegregation , such as the use of busing in Austin , Texas , and his attempts to compromise with Congress on welfare reform . Richardson has a self-protective knack of getting along with his superiors .                @ @ @ @ @
