 | Heat-saving fireplaces - enjoy the flames without the waste @# Beset by charges that wood-burningfireplaces are hopelessly inefficient , wasteful , and even counterproductive , the people that make are fighting back . As well they might with their existence at stake . In some parts of the country , fireplaces have actually been outlawed in new construction . The son is that a conventional fireIce ineptly used may not only produce very little heat ; it may en chill your house . The threat fireplace builders is a threat to I us open-fire buffs as well . To keep their product viable in energy-short world , innovative fireplace makers have attacked the problem on four major fronts . Generally , these new designs are availe in complete , new fireplaces . me of the methods used , however - can be adapted to many older places ( see PS , Nov. ' 77 , Sept. and concluding box ) . Dampers and doors The most serious charge against the ordinary fireplace is that it steals room air ? air that you 've spent energy dollars to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may keep right on doing so even when it is cold and dead . This between-fires heat loss can total more than the heat gained during the hours a fire is burning . All you have to do to reduce this loss markedly is close the damper as soon as the fire is fully out . That 's if your fireplace has a damper ? one that 's not too difficult to use ? and it seals effectively . And if you remember every time . To answer all these problems , fireplace manufacturers are now supplying more effective and convenient dampers . Such dampers also save energy by providing fire control . A damper that may need to be wide open while a fire is being kindled can soon be partly closed to control burning speed , thus saving wood . But there is a far more effective control available for use either alone or in conjunction with a damper : metal or glass doors to close off the fireplace opening . The prime time for using doors is when you leave the house or go to bed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the damper under such circumstances . But you can seal off the fireplace opening by closing the doors ; thus you keep the warm room air from rushing up the chimney as the fire smoulders and dies . Some doors may be closed even when there 's a fire burning . Your fireplace then converts to stove efficiency . If the doors are glass , you still have the pleasure of watching the fire . A fireplace door can be an important safety device as well , protecting against sparks and rolling logs . Among freestanding units , the equivalent of the fireplace with a glass door is a cone-shaped model called Carousel . Made by Malm Fireplaces , it is glass all the way around under a metal hood . One glass section opens for log placement and draft control . Circulating fireplaces One version of the fireplace that heats and circulates air has been around for a long time ? the doublewalled steel firebox around which a masonry fireplace is built . It is best known under the trade name Heatilator , used by a principal maker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline because of competition from the far cheaper , more adaptable , and faster-toinstall zero-clearance units . But the early zero-clearance fireplaces fell short in efficiency . Now manufac-Continued OCTOBER 1978 1 133  | turers have introduced new aircirculating versions . Air is drawn in through a slit below the firebox or perhaps at the sides , and is forced out at the top of the opening , through wall grilles above the fireplace , or to the sides . The circulator zero-clearance units can be installed in a matter of hours directly on wood floors and against framing studs . Fire-code requirements are met by providing a hearth and surrounding the opening with a fireproof material . While a zero-clearance circulator can go almost anywhere , the masonry-surround circulators require solid foundations to hold masonry walls . Chimneys are commonly masonry , too . Water pipes passing through a fireplace have long been used by ingenious builders to heat domestic water supplies . In an extension of this idea , one fireplace ( called Hydroplace ) now comes with coils through which water ( or other liquid ) passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat exchanger . This heated water then warms the house , and , if desired , the domestic hot-water supply . The natural complement of this system is a solar heating system , for which the Hydroplace provides backup heat on dull days . You can retrofit a conventional fireplace with the Hydrohearth , a water-circulating grate . Air circulators are also available for retrofitting . Some types are simply hollow grates that sit in the fireplace . Others use fans . For freestanding fireplaces there are heat extractors that install around the lower part of the smokestack .

If this is your problem , you want a circulator designed to du heat to other rooms . Both the zeroclearance types and the ones requiring masonry surrounds can do this . Ducting is simplest , naturally . when the second room to be heated is directly behind the fireplace . . A fireplace in such an interior location will also return to the house a greater portion of the heat produced in it . - In new construction or extensive remodeling , it 's usually feasible to carry ducts to more distant rooms . Some models can be ducted to rooms on other floors . The most efficient arrangement is one in  | which the furnace ducts are connected to the circulator fireplace as wel1 . Any fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Some , such as the Pyroplaces , are designed for this use . Outside air for combustion Most fireplaces take their combustion air from the room they 're in . Such a large quantity of air is involved that in many modern , tightly constructed houses a winmust be opened for the fire to burn without smoking . When this great volume of room has already been heated by a furnace , it is wasteful to burn it up . Some new fireplaces include a connection to outside air . Other models have optional kits for this . With a masonry fireplace it may possible to supply outdoor air without special ducting . The ashpit be cleaned and kept open , wing air to be drawn directly into the firebox . The necessity of supplying ample air to a fireplace was demonstrated to the family of Richard Sanford , a carpenter in Monticello , a . Sanford had insulated to the hilt .
