THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment F 4 VER since President Sadat made his trip to Jerusalem , a drama of peacemaking has been unfolding within sight of the world . We can see the episodes in the story even as they occur , because a network of communications satellites , in orbit above the earth , has brought the planet 's various regions into a visually synchronous whole . At times , as the people around the world have sat in front of their screens watching the events in Jerusalem , Cairo , Washington , and Ismailia , it has seemed that the earth has been turned into a vast stadium , in which the people of the earth are seated as a single audience , looking down from dim bleachers onto the floodlit spot where statesmen move and act . Sadat did not create this audience by going to Jerusalem ; he merely became the first man to step out before it . When he did so , everyone could recognize that it had been there all along . Some observers have tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television politics , " in the phrase of one American columnist . Their skepticism is understandable . Considering the history of organized publicity in our century  --  its origin in the democratic nations as a means of selling products , its full flowering in totalitarian nations as a means of providing the public with a substitute version not only of present events but also of history , and , finally , its reimportation in recent times into the democracies , in the form of political image-making  --  it is not surprising that any exercise in mass communication should arouse profound suspicion . All in all , we in the twentieth century are probably the most lied-to people in history , and it has become hard for us to take anything at its face value . But in the case of the publicity surrounding the new negotiations over the Middle East there are reasons for believing that something more than the usual " television politics " is going on . For one thing , the coverage has not been imposed from above . It has not been force-fed coverage , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less captive audiences within their own territories . President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin may have welcomed the coverage , but they have not commanded it , or controlled it in any way . Every country has been free to accept or reject what was being sent through the air . The people of the world are themselves hungry for this news . And they have good reason to be . Everyone has the most urgent and personal interest possible in the success of the negotiations : the protection of his own life from the threat of a global war that could one day be touched off in the Middle East . For just off camera  --  and sometimes on camera  --  are the military patrons of the Middle Eastern powers : the superpowers , with their weapons of world destruction . If in recent years television has created a world community of potential spectators , the spread of nuclear weapons in that same period has created a world community of potential victims . The world has been paying attention to the dealings among a few minor powers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is at stake . ( By contrast , the world has shown no such interest in events , including actual wars  --  the one between Somalia and Ethiopia , for example  --  in which the commitment of the superpowers is not very deep . ) It would not he exaggerating to say that in making themselves available to global television President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin , far from aggrandizing themselves at the expense of a gullible public , were actually fulfilling a responsibility to all of us . By reporting to everyone on the progress of their talks , they in a sense recognized their accountability to everyone . Certainly the world has responded , in the main , as though this were so . " World opinion " ? heretofore a largely ineffectual , perhaps even a mythical force in world affairs  --  has suddenly taken on body and shape . The gauges of public opinion , including the public-opinion polls , have been shooting up and down at a startling speed as tides of opinion , unconfined by local barriers , have washed back and forth across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded that in the new global audience certain wide gaps have been conspicuous . Neither the Soviet Union nor China showed its people President Sadat 's speech before the Knesset , and in these countries subsequent coverage of the negotiations has been scanty . Coming at a time when a newly constituted world public was discovering its voice and its will , and making its first tentative , groping common affirmation of the goal of human survival , the decisions to censor the news from the Middle East became something more than just another instance of information control . It became self-imposed exile from the family of nations  --  a boycott of the human race . We have always known that those who suppress human rights pay a price in loyalty . Now it appears that there is an additional price to pay . Nations that take away the freedoms of their own people in effect drop out of history . They strand themselves in a backwater of time . ? ? Winter Into Summer E got a call recently from David Daniels , a Cambridge , Massa-chusetts , painter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he has over two hundred and fifty rose-bushes in a fifteen-by-thirty-foot garden next to his house . The last time we had seen Daniels , he was sitting in his blazling rose garden . This time , he said , " Come on up and I 'll show you my snow yacht . " Just over a year ago , he bought a piece of land in the mountains of central ( Massachusetts north of Worcester which Bostonians call the Snow Belt . This is land that was America 's most fertile farmland the Ohio of its time  --  until around 1840 , when the farmers moved west and began to farm Ohio itself . Now it is hidden country , for the most part : small towns , some of them prosperous , that make furniture and machine tools ; villages with quietly well-to-do summer folks and a few farmers . Most of the nineteenth-century farms are forest again . To people driving by , they look as if they had always been forest , and therefore much of the land in the Snow Belt is land that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the first summer clearing a field every weekend with his wife , Virginia , and some friends . " Most people say you ca n't clear a field , " Daniels said when we drove up to see his snow yacht . " ' Oh , is n't it a pity that it 's all grown over , ' they say . But these fields are very easy to get in trim , because trimming is what is required . All we had to do was chip away like Michelangelo and reveal the beautiful estate within . As we worked , I began to see why people from England called this land New England . They left the old trees spaced out , and the farms they made were landscaped like parkland If you get all your friends together , you can clear your fields in a few weekends This is a thing that can be done , because everyone has friends . We cleared a three-acre field with one small Sears tractor mower , a small Toro lawnmower , and a Weed Eater , and now Virginia can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours ' work a week . Chi Pai-shih , the Picasso of modern China , wrote in his memoirs , If you want to do something , do it  --  and sooner or later it will be done . ' And it 's true , no If you took practically any mountain farmland in New England and trimmed it , you 'd come up with a beautiful English park . People are afraid to do it , because they think it 's hard . It 's not hard , and once it 's done , it seems that doing it was nothing . And now let 's talk about stone walls . People tend to think that it took generations of farmers with ten sons to a farm to build the stone walls of New England . But Charlene GniIette and Judy Steinfeld and Cathy Todd , three of my friends from Cambridge  --  three girls with a combined weight of three hundred and eight pounds  --  looked at some of the old walls on the farm and said , ' It does n't look so hard . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's easy , ' they said ' You just roll one stone after another to where you 're working , and put it in place . ' " The reason Daniels cleared the fields is that he believes that nothing gives a man more peace of mind than seeing JANUARY 9 , 1 9 7 8 a few acres of cleared field . If danger is com-ing from anywhere , you can see it ; there are no snakes ; bugs are re-duced by fifty per cent ; it 's pleasant . This past summer , with his fields already turning into a lawn , Daniels built his snow yacht . It 's a small house that stands on a sloping field and looks south across the new lawn to a thirty-two-acre lake . The founda-tions were poured July 8th ; the house was completed September lst . It was built entire-ly on weekends , by Daniels , with the help of some friends and two carpenters ; it cost no more than ten thou-sand dollars altogether . ( The land  --  five and a quarter acres  --  cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom , a pre-cut log cabin , ten feet by sixteen feet , that sits over the concrete basement . To the east side of the bedroom is a four-by-eight-foot bathroom , and be-yond that a prefabricated eight-by-twelve-foot greenhouse . On the west side of the bedroom is a twelve-by-twelve-foot porch , with six sliding glass doors set next to each other , like sliding Japanese screens . An old Oriental rug that Daniels bought in Cambridge some years ago covers the floor of the sun porch , and there are a couple of comfortable chairs covered by fur throws . Daniels says he decided to use the rug when his brother Michael , a Washing-ton attorney who represents Japanese wool-textile exporters , assured him that an Oriental rug is as tough a flour cov-ering as concrete , besides being far more beautiful . Moths wo n't get into such a rug except under a chair in a dark corner . It wo n't fade , because the wool it is woven from is dyed and dried in the sun many times before the weaving begins . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ceiling of the yacht is pine planks formed into the clerestory shape of the ceiling of a wide-gauge railroad ob-servation car of the nineteenth century . From the porch , you go up a couple of steps to the bedroom  --  which has beams cut in zigzag , lightning-bolt shapes , in the old Carpathian peasant fashion , and a double bed , and an eight-foot-wide sliding glass door looking down toward the lake . The ceiling is decorated with five little carved wooden Russian churches hung upside down like stalactites and , along the walls , with little Indian tigers sitting on Windsor chairs  --  these right side up and seeming to hold up the beams . You cross the bedroom and go down a short flight of steps to the greenhouse . The greenhouse currently has a bougainvillea vine , a bougainvillea tree , a gardenia , a Persian-lemon tree , a key-lime tree ( for key-lime pies ) , a lipstick plant ( it has hale red flowers that look like lipsticks ) , a flowering cactus , and a few roses from Daniels ' Cambridge garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the basement , where there 's a Shenandoah wood-burning furnace , you climb down a set of aluminum hoop rungs set into one wall of the greenhouse like the ladder inside a submarine . Daniels says that , with all its different levels , the house has exercise built into it , so he does n't have to jog . There are electric heating panels along the bottom of the walls on the porch and also in the greenhouse . Daniels uses them and the Shenandoah furnace to heat the whole house . Daniels got the idea for his shipshape house from Frank Lloyd Wright , who called some of his early houses prairie ships , because they looked like schooners riding the Illinois prairie . Daniels figured that in the Snow Belt a snow yacht would be more appropriate . " How much would it cost to buy a yacht ? " he said . " And only a millionaire can have a private observation car . But if you think railroad car or yacht you can have a fabulous house . The trouble is , people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a house Iike a boat , because you have to be on your best behavior in a constricted space . But a house is a stationary yacht . It just does n't goat . " Daniels ' aim in building his house , he said , was to be able to sit in a T-shirt in a completely glass-enclosed space when it was twenty below outside . " The idea for heating the house I got one summer day in my garden in Cambridge , " he explained . " First , I thought of the Roman method of building a hot room and circulating the air from it . Then I remembered Joseph Conrad 's ' Youth , ' a story I read as a student at the University of Chicago . A sailing ship is hound for Bangkok , and the coal in the hold begins to go up in spontaneous combustion . What if it were a contained combustion ? At first , I thought just of a Shenandoah wood furnace in the cellar of my house . A furnace like that can keep a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The furnace heats the basement , and the basement is airtight , so , with relatively little heat loss , the whole basement becomes a furnace . After the fire has been going for a while , the air temperature at the basement ceiling is a hundred and ten degrees  --  and then all you have to do is blow this air out and circulate it . But it takes something like half an hour to heat the house up , so an architect friend of mine suggested electric heat as a starter furnace . ' There 's nothing like electricity for raising heat fast , ' he said . The electric heat can warm the house thirty degrees in just a few minutes  --  and then the wood furnace maintains the heat . The only expense is a few minutes of electric heat , plus about ten cents ' worth of electricity a day , when the house is being lived in , to power a small fan to circulate the hot air from the basement through the house . The wood is free . We cut down about fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've since found that every year every acre of woods produces about a cord of surplus wood ; and most of it does n't even need to be chopped down it just falls . I 'm about fifteen years ahead on free wood right now . I never studied architecture , but I used to go into Frank Lloyd Wright 's Rohie house once a week when I was a student in Chicago . It 's all just common sense , no ? " We sat on the porch of the snow yacht and talked . Daniels had a T-shirt on . It was ten degrees outside , and we looked at sunlight gleaming on the snow covering Daniels ' field and on the ice covering the boughs of the trees down by the frozen lake . Bright pale-blue sky , bright dark-green pine trees , bright gray oak trees , bright , bright snow . Chickadees perched on a sock full of thistle seed that Virginia Daniels had hung from a tree near the house . Inside , it was warm as toast . " Pleasant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a T-shirt on a day when it 's ten degrees outside , and wishing it were a little cooler . With a free wood fire , we can enjoy the beauties of winter with the easy clarity of bright summer . Shakespeare says that in the forest of Arden ' the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter 's wind . ate counsellors that feelingly persuade me what I am . ' But why do you have to have icy fangs to show you what you arc ? What 's wrung with a little sunshine ? We can let bright sun on bright snow show us what we are . " Igor 's THE best time of day for an Anne G. Special , which is one of the best sandwiches in New York  --  an outstanding Lithuanian meal-in-itself combo of roast beef , cheddar cheese , grilled tomato , bacon , and Russian dressing on pumpernickel  --  is three o'clock in the afternoon , the hour when the lunchtime rush of nurses and doctors from St. Vincent 's Hospital and students and professors from the New School thins out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tenth Street . This is a tiny restaurant that seats thirty-six people and serves eighty-nine different kinds of sandwiches , and also omelettes , blintzes , schav , salads , soda , beer , ginger beer , Berliner WTeisse , tea , and coffee , not to mention tortes from Miss Grin-lb-Ws bakeshop around the corner on Greenwich Avenue . Just before three , Igor and Sonja Sudarsky , the two proprietors , get a chance to sit down in the back of the store and take it easy for a while  --  Igor with a cigarette and a book ( he 's reading Lillian Hellman at the moment ) , Sonja with a cup of coffee . Igor makes the sandwiches ; Sonja is the waitress and makes the soups , the salads , the blintzes , and the omelettes . The restaurant has a homegrown look ; there 's a long counter behind which Igor works  --  left over , along with the name Art Foods , from a deli that occupied the premises earlier . The store is a rectangle that runs back from Sixth toward Patchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and extends almost to the back . Up front , there 's a wooden banquette and wooden tables altogether , room for ten . A short stucco wall in front of the counter has a window in it through which Igor hands sandwiches to customers up front , and there 's a little striped awning over the window . A plate-glass window looking out on Sixth has an awning outside over the avenue and another striped awning on the inside , over the front tables . Igor tacks up on the back of the banquette the jackets of new books by writers who come into the restaurant , SO the jackets can be seen from Sixth . Running the length of the restaurant opposite the counter arc five red Formica-topped tables for four and three red Formica-topped tables for two . The hack table for four is usually piled with the books Igor is reading  --  books by Arthur Koestler and Gershom Scholem , the foremost scholar of Jewish mysticism ; a biography of Her7.1 ; the stories of Sholom Akichem  --  and there are more hooks on a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls have tongue-and-groove pine panelling halfway up and , above that , white plaster crowded with pictures , Two of Igur 's heroes are represented among the pictures : there 's an old Sarah Bernhardt poster and a photograph of the Lubavitcher rabbi out in Crown Heights . As a kid in a village on the Volga , and later in Berlin , Igor was fascinated by Bernhardt . He liked her energy -- a woman who had a leg amputated but did n't give up acting , who played for seven years with only one leg . Igor attends the Lubavitcher services on the High Holy Days . He Likes to call himself a non-religious mystic . The Anne G. Special was co-invented fifteen years ago by Sonja and Anne G. , a friend of hers who is a Lithuanian psychiatrist . The recipe for the sandwich first saw print in one of James Beard 's food books . Beard lives a couple of blocks away from Art Foods and is a regular customer . In " Beard on Food , " he says that the Anne G. and two of lgor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nu . 1 , are " imaginative , carefully made , and taste as if someone put them together for themselves , not for the assembly line . " Beard is right : the Anne G. is a remarkable get-together of tastes and impressions light and heavy , tangy and chewy , crunchy and runny , a lingering taste of beef , bread , and cheese . Igor is sixty . Sandwich-making is his third career . He studied economics in Berlin , and then , when Hider came to power in Germany , went to art school and became a commercial artist , because he had already begun to draw and he decided he needed a trade that was portable . Being a commercial artist undoubtedly saved his life in the war . Only a few thousand of the one hun dred and fifty thousand Jewish Lithuanians survived the Second World War ; statistically , they were the worst hit of all communities . Igor left Germany in 1934 , going to Paris and Prague , where he made movie sets , and then to Kaunas ( Kovno ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he got jobs painting movie posters and reviewing plays and movies for a couple of newspapers . At the begin ruing of the war , the Russians occupied Lithuania , and Igor and nineteen other commercial artists were commissioned to redesign the wrappers and labels for all the cigarette packages and beer and seltzer bottles in the country . Igor drew a cloth cap and a dbouette of the Kremlin to replace a top hat and a mosque on the two most popular brands of cigarettes . Igor met Sonja in Kaunas ; she was a farmer 's daughter who was a sculptor . They had become engaged by the time the Germans marched into Kaunas , on a beautiful day in June , 1941 . All of Kaunas 's forty thousand Jews were herded into the poorest neighborhood in town . Igor and Sonja got married right then , because they heard that married couples had a better chance of not being sent away . They lived in a stable with a leaky roof . Igor kept the rain out by nailing to the roof some good oil paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicest-looking roof that over was , " Sonja says . Sonja is short , blond , hustling , and twinkly . Igor is tall , pale , reflective , slightly gaunt , with an incandescent smite . He says Sonja is Prussian and organized and he is Slavic and dreamy . When the Russians got near Lithuania in 1944 , the fifteen thousand Jews still alive in Kaunas were sent to Stutthof , a concentration camp near Danzig . A couple of weeks later , Igor was sent on to Dachau , where , because he could make blueprints , he was put to work building an underground airfield . Working indoors saved his life , he says , because it was warm there and he had no shoes He does n't know why he and Sonja were n't killed there was no logic to it . Once , a friend told him that one of the guards did n't like people with glasses , so he took off his glasses when that guard came around , and he was n't taken away . He says he agrees with Dr. Viktor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that survival has nothing to do with strength ur cleverness . Smoking a cigarette in the hack of Art Foods at 3 P.M. , Igor says , " Sometimes when the guards were looking for people to take away it was right to turn to the left when you walked in front of them . Sometimes it " 1 guess it 's just one of those days when nobody has any dirty clothes . " ? was wrong . How could you know ? There were hundreds of such small adventures every day . We should have been dead already thirty years . " After the war , Igor and Sonja found each other again through the Red Cross , and Igor , who speaks Russian , Lithuanian , German , Yiddish , and a bit of French in addition to English , read letters for the American censors and worked for urrRizA in Munich . Then , in the summer of 1946 , he and Sonja came to New York . Neither of them had wanted to stay in Germany . They spent a year in North Carolina working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a commercial artist in New York , designing boxes for cigarettes , perfume , and candy . In 1948 , a friend called him up  --  a Polish lawyer , who was thinking of buying a small grocery store and delicatessen on Sixth Avenue with his wife , also a Polish lawyer . Did Igor want to help ? He should come give it a look . Igor was a partner in Art Foods for ten years , and became sole owner when the Poles got tired of the business and the husband got a good job with a Japanese doll company . The Poles sold him their interest in the stoic for a dollar . Igor phased out the gro ceries and built up the sandwich business , modelling the sandwiches on the ones sold by Oskar Davidsen 's , the famous restaurant in Copenhagen , which he had once visited . ( Igor 's sandwiches are not open-faced , though . ) He named several sandwiches after people who came in and ate them regularly : the Michael Sinclair Special , the Ted Estabrook Special , the Diane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country and who also writes children 's books . Her special , a nice , light sandwich , is egg salad , sliced pineapple , cream cheese , and lettuce and tomato on pumpernickel . Michael Sinclair  --  ham , fried egg , and fried onions is an English stage manager . Ted Estahrook  --  liver p ; lit6 , tomato , and cucumber  --  runs a television workshop upstairs over Art Foods . E. E. Cummings , who lived on Patchin Place , always ate a Fifth Avenue Special turkey , ham , Swiss cheese , cole slaw , and Russian dressing . A. J. Lichling , when he lived on Fifth Avenue at Ninth , liked to come in for three Brevoorts at a sitting  --  turkey , ham , hard-boiled egg , tomato , and Russian  --  washed down with four or five bottles of Fix , a Greek beer , which Igor stocked for him . Other regulars over the years have been Arthur Miller ; Dustin Hoffman ; Willem de Kooning ; David Amram , who lives upstairs a few doors away ; Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch with his father at Igor 's . Mailer pare liked to say to Igor , " You see my son ? He thinks he 's a writer . " Igor and Sonja have two daughters , Claudia and Ilona , now twenty-three and twenty-one . Claudia is in nursing school , and Ilona is studying to be a cosmetician  --  she wants to do makeup for TV performers . Igor once named omelettes after the two girls , the Princess Claudia and the Princess Ilona , but later took the names off the menu , because both girls said they did n't want to be princesses . Igor did some painting on the side for a while after he became a restaurateur . He painted concentration-camp scenes , but they did n't satisfy hint . It was impossible to express what he had seen , so he stopped painting . He says he likes the food business . " Love you forget , but you always remember food , " he says .
