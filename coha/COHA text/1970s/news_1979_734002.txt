txt EFFORTS TO GET the Chicago - area 's mass transportation system back to normal were dealt another setback Friday night by a freezing rain that crippled western CTA rapid transit lines . The CTA problems rippled through the entire system . Rapid transit riders crowded onto buses and commuter trains , and the week 's painfully slow improvements evaporated under a new weather onslaught . Many businesses closed early to give employes a head start on the rush when word spread of the CTA 's troubles . That resulted in heavy crowding and major delays on commuter railroads before the evening rush began , the Regional Transportation Authority reported . The Chicago and North Western and the Illinois Central Gulf railroads abandoned their schedules and express trains . Trains were sent out as they filled in an effort to handle the early crowds that streamed into stations . THE RTA SAID other commuter lines adhered to schedules , but suffered delays because of overcrowding that forced longer station stops . " We just got hit with a heavy , heavy surge of passengers , " an RTA spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , however , got a break : The cars were so crowded that conductors did not bother to take tickets . And there was good news for South Shore riders : Some service is expected to be resumed Monday on the line , which has been closed all week . CTA buses were crowded , as they have been all week , and many weatherweary commuters watched in anger as full buses drove past stops . O'Hare International Airport had five runways open , though delays of up to an hour were still reported . THE CULPRIT Friday night was not snow , as it had been since last Saturday 's 20.7-inch blizzard , but a drizzling rain that turned to ice on rapid transit tracks , creating difficulties on the third rail , which carries the power . Tom Buck , a CTA spokesman , said a misty morning snow plagued northern rapid transit lines , stranding thousands of passengers on elevated platforms .

Tribune Photo by Walter Kale All bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad tale of many Chicago area commuters who waited for late-running and overcrowded buses Friday . Push , shove , cuss : that 's Friday rush hour // western lines the most , " he said . Buck said the ice virtually shut down the Lake Street line at the height of rush hour and ended service on the Douglas line . That meant long waits between trains-45 minutes to an hour ? on the Congress and Eisenhower lines as they took up the overflow . TITE CTA ADVISED rapid transit riders to try to get home by bus or commuter train , and there the riders found the delays that had plagued riders all week . So , for many commuters , the week ended much as it began  --  amid confilsion and delays . The waits had not shortened  --  but tempers had . " I have been standing here for half an hour and I want on , " an angry woman shouted in vain as the doors of a CTA bus with a full house closed . Variations of her cry were heard all week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blizzard of ' 79 melts into memory . Besides the cold , snow , and long waits , commuters have been complain . ing about a lack of information about the delays . That complaint surfaced at Friday 's meeting of the Regional Transportation Authority . SUBURBAN AND city RTA board members alike called for an emergency commupnicatlons system that would link all buses , trains , and train stations with a control center . " We 've had an extraordinary problem with communications since the weekend snow , " said D. Daniel Baldino , a board member from Evanston . " It 's just going to be unacceptable to the public if it continues . " Board chairman Lewis Hill agreed . " Let 's find out what it costs and go ahead with it .. .. Our goal should be to have it fully installed throughout the system by next winter , " Hill said . FOR MAJOR expenditures such as that needed to build such a system , the board normally seeks state and federal funds . The federal share of such funding is about 80 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from planning to installation , one observer said . CTA trains are equipped with public address systems that conductors can use to advise passengers of delays . Several stations are equipped with public address systems , and plans are under way for the installation of others . The Illinois Central Gulf Railroad has speakers at all of its stations , but most commuter rail lines have loud speaker systems only in their downtown terminals .
