MACBETH <P> Directed by ROMAN POLANSKI <P> Screenplay by ROMAN POLANSKI and KENNETH TYNAN <P> No sound , no fury . Instead , a palpable sense of clammy despair and an eerie surrealism . The milieu is torn from Polanski 's imagination and flung into some medieval limbo . The visual images are often gripping , but the poetry of the play-as well as its force - is missing . <P> Shakespeare 's Thane is a man possessed by his own craving for power . He is destroyed by the evil within himself , not , as Polanski would have it , by witchly auguries of doom . Polanski is most at home dealing with black magic , and Macbeth 's second meeting with the witches ( " Bubble , bubble , toil and trouble . . . " ) is expanded into a veritable convention , with dozens of naked , withered old crones cackling and drooling all over themselves . It looks like a remnant of Rosemary 's Baby . Polanski 's affection for the supernatural is so unrestrained that many of the movie 's straight scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into conversation , and some of the best lines are simply tossed away . This may make Macbeth a bit more contemporary , but it also makes it ordinary . <P> Polanski takes occasional excursions into outright fantasy , as when Macbeth has a feverish dream following his second meeting with the witches . But the scene is visually uninspired and mechanically clumsy . Faces and images swirl up out of the hags ' cauldron , spin about , dissolve , disappear , as if in some hybrid of hallucinogenic nightmare and the kind of antique special effects that looked awkward over 25 years ago in Hitchcock 's Spellbound . <P> Francesca Annis makes an interestingly brittle Lady Macbeth , but Jon Finch 's Macbeth seems to be consumed by tuberculosis . In the climactic battle with Duncan , Finch looks as if he was having some trouble hefting his broadsword . But the supporting cast ( Martin Shaw , Terence Bayler , John Stride ) is fiery , and Polanski manages most of the violent confrontations with brio . <P> The Tynan-Polanski adaptation contains some arresting notions . Ross becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare banished to Ireland early in the action ) here reappears at the end of the play , riding across the grim countryside to seek counsel from the three witches . This ominous epilogue neatly evokes the idea of a cyclical , irresistible destiny . <P> ? J.C .
