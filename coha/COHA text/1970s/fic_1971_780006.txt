 | They were sturdy , noisy , argumentative , offended because I did n't spend more time with them . There was no need to . My father came every Sunday , devoting himself fully to Alma and the boys . But he had never taken me to a ball game , never fished with me , never taken a long hike to a snow-capped mountain . Our relationship was polite but distant . Even when mother died , we grieved apart . But he was not gentle in criticizing my behavior . Only a week earlier , he had called me into his office to discuss difficulties in funding his grant . It was a pretext for something else . " You do n't carry your weight in this laboratory , " he said bluntly . " We 're in a race with Duckworth and you 've been absolutely no help . You 've lost all sense of purpose , of honor . " " I do more than my share , " I said hotly . " Frolicking in the hay with my lab technician ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said . I shook my head angrily . Two years back , there had been an abortive affair with a sloe-eyed blonde graduate student . It had been exciting , tempestuous , and had fizzled out a few months later . But Sarah Frey was a totally different kind of a girl . There were bonds between us that grew stronger by the hour , something neither my father nor my wife would ever understand . My father had gotten rid of the blonde graduate student , but so far he had n't acted against Sarah . I think he knew it would be no use . " I 'm very fond of Sarah , " I said . " There 's nothing in it beyond that . " My father snorted , and I got up and walked out in a huff . Of course he was right . I was entangled from the first day Sarah Frey walked into the laboratory , six months back , her thick black hair lying in two woven plaits along the stiff white back of her starched smock ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a warm smile . She was efficient , good with our animals , and very careful about recording data . One morning , when my father had come in unexpectedly , he found us in a passionate embrace . I would have preferred an explosion , but he remained calm , pretending nothing had happened . He even spoke dispassionately to Sarah about preparing a new diet for our capuchin monkeys . The recollection was still painful . I shuffled the papers on my desk aimlessly . It took the most enormous effort of concentration , but I tried to pull my thoughts back to my work . And for some moments , I succeeded . Twenty years back , I had begun my long search to determine the influences controlling the biological clock . What was it that sent the body temperature of a warmblooded animal through the same up and down cycle , day after day ? Why did so many metabolic functions depend on the length of day ? My father and I had discussed these questions at great length and it was agreed that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emmett Duckworth , the noted biochemist , had been our closest competitor and we could literally feel his hot breath on our tails . But chance was completely on father 's side . It was his good fortune to be the first to show that brain potentials were definitely dependent on fluctuations in the Earth 's magnetic field . Working first with capuchin monkeys , then with humans , he demonstrated that the most significant of the brain biopotentials , the alpha rhythm , varied between eight and sixteen times each second , just as the fluctuations did in the Earth 's magnetic field . And my father had been called to Sweden to receive the magnificent gold medal and the fat cash award . I was proud of my father , proud of his trail-breaking  | accomplishments , and also fiercely envious . I had given up ever understanding why . Maybe it was the unrelenting sense of competition that surrounded everything he did . Even now , he was still striving to be first , engaging me in a competition I did n't want , both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes two to race , " I said out loud . " And I 'm not going to run . " My telephone rang . It was my father , a lousy fifty feet down the corridor , but too busy to walk over and talk to me directly . It was hard to control the contempt in my voice . " What is it ? " I said . " I have something of tremendous importance to discuss , " he said . " And I 've a lot to show you . Could you spare me a few minutes ? " A few minutes ? I had great chunks of empty time ahead . " I 'm tied up now , " I said . " But I 'll be over in a half hour . " I leaned over and set the alarm of my electric clock one half hour ahead . My father could tolerate many things , but never tardiness . I arrived punctually at my father 's office and sat down in the very comfortable leather chair just opposite his desk . We looked directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I looked down at the rug . It was uncanny , almost unnerving at times , to see how much alike in appearance my father and I were . Except for the silver hair and the toughened , wrinkled skin of a seventy-year-old , we could have passed for brothers . My father sat there puffing on his pipe . The rich aroma of his honeyed tobacco began to fill every corner of the room . I had detested that smell , even as a child . " I have something to show you , John , " said my father .  | He spoke out of the corner of his mouth without removing his pipe . That , too , annoyed the hell out of me . " I would very much like to get your opinion on it , " he said . " Since when did my opinion matter here ? " My father glared at me . " To hell with your self-pity , " he said . " I want your scientific acumen if you 've got any left . I 'm thinking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grinned in spite of myself . My father had always been preoccupied with this question , for as many years as I could recall . It was an obsession . " We both know , " said my father , going along lines he had taken innumerable times , " that on a microscopic level there is no preferred direction for time . The equations of motion do n't give a damn whether time moves forward or backward . " " But it does matter on a macroscopic level ? " I asked , pulled into the dialogue in spite of my resentment . " After all , if the direction of time were equally likely in the forward and backward directions , then there would have to be a total symmetry in the form and process of all animals . We know there 's a rough kind of symmetry , but it breaks down when you examine it closely . Obviously , the human heart and aorta are not symmetrical . " " You 're absolutely right , " said my father , and I got a thrill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more vigorously on his pipe , and great blue clouds of smoke began to surround his head . It presaged a good deal more talk . " What it boils down to , " said my father , " is that on a small scale , say on the scale of the Earth itself , there may not be a macroscopic symmetry . But over the enormous reach of the universe , things have to average  | out . If men on Earth have a heart and aorta that point one way , then , on some other planet in some remote corner of the universe , other men have hearts and aortas that go the other way . " " That sounds like an extension of the particle-antiparticle reasoning to me , " I said . " Exactly , " said my father . " I might even speculate that since we age in a particular direction here on Earth , perhaps other men grow younger with time elsewhere . " I started to laugh . " And come out of their mother 's wombs , gnarled , bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his pipe . " You 've reduced my remarks to complete absurdity , " he said quietly . I was happy to see my father angry but it also made me uneasy . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " But your remarks did seem to point in that direction . " My father stood up abruptly , knocking the ashes of his pipe into a huge embossed silver tray that had been given to him by the laboratory staff when he had received his Nobel Prize . " Talk is cheap , " he said . " Let 's go into the laboratory . You 'll see what I mean . " We walked into the outer corridors , which were dimly lit , and on to the capuchin monkey laboratory . In the center of the laboratory , on a large bench , was a single wire cage . Just behind it was a tall rack of electronic equipment with an L-shaped arm swinging out above the cage . Affixed to the arm and directly over the center of the cage was an enormous bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered into it , clucking very softly to the animal within . I came up behind him and looked over his shoulder . There was a  | very old animal inside the cage , one so wrinkled and gray that I was amazed it still lived . " Do you recognize it ? " asked my father . " Not really , " I said . " It 's our young Ginger . " At first I thought it was a grotesque joke , but of course I knew my father had no sense of humor . I looked up at the bank of coils above the cage . My father 's eyes followed mine . " That 's the magnetic field synthesizer I had built , " said my father . " With it , I can place a controlled field into a one-millimeter area at any point within five feet of the synthesizer . I can vary amplitude and frequency over a large range . " " And Ginger ? " " I locked her into an eight cycles per second magnetic field , " said my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track metabolically with the fluctuations of this artificial field . Gradually , I began to increase the rate of the fluctuations . As you can see , her biological clock speeded up internally , and aging began to take place at a very rapid pace . " " It 's incredible , " I said . " I would n't have believed it possible . " For the moment my jealousy and antagonism fell away , and the magnitude of his achievement caught hold of my imagination . I examined the animal closely . The features were similar to those of Ginger , but I could n't be sure . Around her ankle was a tiny identification bracelet marked " Ginger . " But it might have been transferred from the real Ginger . " I know what you 're thinking , " said my father . " But I 've never faked data in my life , and you damn well know it . " He lifted a thick notebook which was at one side of the cage .  | " All of my records are in here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer me your comments . " I took the notebook out of his hands . It was truly heavy . For a fleeting moment , I thought of how upset my father would be if I burned the notebook . Then I pushed the idea out of my head . " One question , " I said . " How do you direct this field at the animal ? Do you need uniform field strength ? Do you have to focus in a particular site of the cortex or are there several areas involved ? " " There is a single site involved , " said my father . " Read the notebook ; it 's all in there . " For a moment he looked at me , his eyes warm and almost , it seemed , loving . " You 've called me cold and aloof . But what I 'm suggesting is that you now carry out the experiments of slowing down the field fluctuation rate . " My eyes filled . It was enormously generous of him , I knew . In effect , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could be the threshold to immortality for the first time in man 's history . The concept was breathtaking . " I 'll start reading your notebook at once , " I said . On the way back to my office , I passed Sarah Frey . She reached out and caressed my arm . Oddly enough , I was annoyed . I nodded at her , curtly , and went on without a word , laboring under the weight of the great notebook . I read through every scrap of the data , my excitement mounting all the way . It was clear that we had beaten Duckworth to the punch and that the experiment of slowing down the fields was really going to rock the world of science . And then it hit me , the great shock of realizing that all of this was my father 's work , all his accomplishment and none of it mine . He was handing it  | to me on a silver platter . But I had n't degenerated to the point where I could accept such a gift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his notebook . He looked at me , his great black , almost youthful eyes now expressionless . " It 's your work and not mine , " I said . " You 've done a fantastic job , but I 'm not going to climb on to your bandwagon as though it were my own . I 've got to make it myself . " My father sighed . " Either I give you too little or too much . Why ca n't you climb aboard ? There 's enough glory and accomplishment here for five men . And there is so much yet to be worked out . Or do you want to burn up all of your creativity inside Sarah Frey ? " I began to shout . " Leave Sarah out of this . What I do with her is my own goddamned affair . And it 's a damn sight more loving , more human and meaningful than your preoccupations with gold medals and applause . " " So that 's it , " said my father . I stormed out of his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the childishness of what I had said and done . My father was right , and I ought to have joined him . But I could n't . I was like an upended hour glass , losing all of its sand , and no one was able to turn me right side up so I could get a fresh start . I spent the night with Sarah . I telephoned my wife and told her , as on countless occasions , that I would be working late at the laboratory and sleeping over . And as always , Alma sighed and pretended to believe me . In the morning , I told Sarah that I was going to divorce my wife . She was sitting before the mirror , brushing her hair with long , even strokes , unleashing a rich perfume from the blue-black locks , and her hand began to tremble .  | But she said nothing . Did she believe me ? I swore that I meant it this time , but Sarah was unconvinced . Or was it really the twenty-year difference in our ages ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days thereafter I ignored her attempts to approach me . My father was more direct with me . If he met me coming down the corridor , he would turn back . I knew his work went on , perhaps the very same experiments I had refused to do . But I would not humble myself . One evening , when I had forced myself to stay behind and work on a lackluster paper which I was scheduled to give at a spring meeting , my father broke into my office with great excitement . His step was springy , and he seemed to be bursting with a vitality that belied his years . " Come with me , " he said . I followed , great fear building in me . We went back to the capuchin room and the cage of Ginger . My father gestured at the cage , and I looked inside . She had been restored to her youth ! " Congratulations , " I said , but I was close to complete despair . It might have been my own achievement . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of my mind took form . " I know that as yet you have n't tried this process on a human , " I said . " I 'm willing to volunteer . " " It 's courageous of you , " said my father . " But the danger is enormous . It would require extreme care and a protracted exposure to avoid reversing the metabolic processes too abruptly . " " It 's not courage , " I said . " I want another chance to start afresh . Twenty years would give me that chance . Perhaps then I could avoid the things that led me into a blind alley . " " It 's too late , " said my father . " You 've a wife and three fine boys . You ca n't turn back . "  | " I 'm determined , " I said . " If you wo n't help me , you know that I will get there by myself . " " I know , " he said . " But you 're a fool . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory sink and washed his face vigorously with soap and water . The dried , leathery skin seemed to vanish like smoke , and a clear , ruddy skin emerged . " All make-up , " said my father . He reached up and removed the silver hair , and a full head of chestnut-colored hair , the counterpart of my own , emerged . " As you can see , " he said , " I 've already carried out the experiment . " I looked at him . He was almost my mirror image . " You 're a swine , " I said . " A lecherous beast . You took my work , my ambition , my wife and children . Now you 've taken my body . " " It 's not like that at all , " he muttered . " You know it was logically the next step in my research . " " Was it ? " I said . " Are you logically headed next for Alma 's bed ? " He flushed to the roots . " I 'll trade her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least you can give me that . " " I 'd do it gladly , " he said grimly . " And I would take far better care of your family than you ever did . But even supposing I were to entertain your absurd proposition , what would become of me , the old me ? " " That 's your problem , " I said . " For once in your life , think of me first . " " You 're out of your head , " said my father . He reached out and took hold of the silver hairpiece and very carefully tugged it back into place . Then he walked out of the laboratory .  | That night I did n't even bother to call Alma . I got roaring drunk and stayed that way until I lost track of the days . When I awoke , I was bone weary . My head was splitting , and every part of my body ached beyond description . It was much more than a hangover . I tried to lift my arm and the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself at a strange desk . I stared at the pile of neatly lettered papers , the thick notebook . I looked down at my hands . They were gnarled , the hands of a man in his seventies , the skin puckered , leathery . I lifted the water-spotted shaving mirror that lay at one side of the desk and looked at my reflection . It was the face of my father , or rather , his face before he had turned back his biological clock . Or was it really my face ? I was terribly confused . Waking from a long nap does that to me . I was still in that half-awake state where one is not sure what one has dreamed and what is real . Sarah Frey came gliding in to drop a report on the desk . I reached out to caress her rump , and she nearly leaped out of her skin . She was out of the room before I could say a word . I looked at the notebook , opened it , and idly turned the pages . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to doze off , and out of the corner of my eye , I saw a younger version of myself , standing motionless in the doorway of the office , staring at me with his large , dark , angry eyes . And just in the moment that I dropped into the deep solace of my nap , I thought , " You fool , the things you took were ephemeral . But I , after all , am now the Nobel laureate. "  | IT WAS COOL in Duckworth 's lab but the sharp barking of rifles outside had heated my blood . " Silly bastards , " I said . " I 'd like to bend those rifles around their necks . " It was , of course , the day of the great match , a rifle shoot between our University and Picayune U. Earlier , two hundred protesting students holding cork-firing popguns had circled round the spectators but the Sheriff had ended the demonstration by confiscating the corks . Duckworth , as always , seemed oblivious to all of the brouhaha that was taking place outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where two glass cages sat side by side on a table . There were several rabbits in each one . " Remarkable , " he said , stroking his unkempt little beard . " What 's remarkable , " I said bitingly . Duckworth seemed unruffled by my tone . " These fellows here , " he said . " Look at how well they 're getting on . "  | I looked , and they were . Inside one cage were four of the plumpest rabbits I 'd ever seen . The four in the other cage seemed average in appearance . " It does n't make sense , " said Duckworth . Patiently he explained the nature of his latest experiment . " As you know , " he said , " my macromolecule is rather unstable . One of the fragmenting submolecular links , which I call Momine , tends to combine with oxygen in a compound so stable that you ca n't pry the oxygen loose . " He lifted the cover off one of the cages and struck a match , then placed it within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " I said . " The atmosphere in that cage contains Momine . Therefore the bound oxygen wo n't support combustion . It is remarkable . " " That 's not quite what I meant , " said Duckworth . " What I do n't understand is how the rabbits can thrive in that same atmosphere . How do they utilize the bound oxygen ? " I shook my head , baffled . " What concentration of Momine do you maintain in the cage ? " " About one part in a trillion trillion , " said Duckworth . " It 's uncannily effective . " The sound of rifle fire outside intensified as the match began to reach its climax . And for the first time , Duckworth seemed to be annoyed . He walked to the window and raised the sash . " Do n't do that , Duckworth , " I said testily . " What about the air conditioning ? " But Duckworth had rolled the table with the rabbit cages over to the window and had set up a small electric fan behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage for just a fraction of a second . The rifle fire stopped abruptly .  | " That 'll teach them , " said Duckworth . " Good God , " I said . " Your Momine has kept the rifles from firing ! " " I expected it would , " said Duckworth . I fished out my pocket handkerchief and mopped a brow that had begun to exude sweat . " Those fellows might not be able to breathe , " I cried . " No such luck , " said Duckworth . " You saw what happened with the rabbits . Momine does n't hurt humans , either . I 've already inhaled some myself . " I walked to the window and looked out at the two competing rifle teams . There seemed to be a good deal of confusion and several of the rifles were being taken apart . " How long will the rifles be immobilized ? " Duckworth smiled . " It 'll be hours before they can ignite a cartridge , " he said . As I left the Chemistry building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mustachioed faculty adviser and coach of our Rifle team . He held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the National Guard . " Hi there , Colonel , " I said . " Going to turn your rifles into ploughshares ? " " The quotation is swords into ploughshares , " he muttered . " Better find some new cartridges , " I said . " Somebody sold you a lot of duds . " The expression on Armbuster 's face told me I 'd overstepped the bounds . " How did you know our cartridges would n't fire ? " he said suspiciously . He turned his gaze on the Chemistry building . " I took courses in Science , once . I know Science Fiction , too . Was it a force field ? Or a beam of muon particles ? "  | I looked at his gaping mouth and I longed to put my fist in it . " It was just Momine , " I said . " An offshoot of Duckworth 's macromolecule . " " Duckworth , " said Armbruster , shaking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned alchemist . " He insisted on seeing Duckworth straightaway so I had no choice but to go along with him . Duckworth was quite annoyed with me . " You 're just an old-fashioned garden variety of snitcher , " he said to me , sotto voce . I hung my head . Armbruster , who had caught the drift of Duckworth 's remark , defended me . " He was right to tell the truth , " he said . " What the devil did you do to our rifles ? " Duckworth showed admirable restraint and patience . He lit a match and showed how placing it in Momine extinguished the flame . Armbruster was staggered . " It 's a witch 's brew , " he said . " If enough of it got around , there 'd never be another rifle fired . " " I had n't thought of that , " said Duckworth , growing pensive . Armbruster turned to me for support but I shook my head at him , and ashen faced , he tottered out of the lab . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw Armbruster trace a wavering path right into the Administration building . He emerged several minutes later with two gentlemen behind him . One of them had an awkward stride as if both legs had been broken below the knee and never properly set . " Holy cow , Duckworth , " I cried . " Armbuster is coming back with President Hinkle ! " Featherman , a puckish graduate student who had just come into the lab , drew out his harmonica and favored  | us with a chorus of " Hail to the Chief . " Duckworth shushed him with a single bleak look . " Let them come , " said Duckworth . " They ca n't intimidate me . " As the trio of complainants entered the lab , it was clear that the third , as yet unidentified , member of the group was a VIP of high rank . He was a balding , redfaced man of medium height , wearing lederhosen about his spherical outline , and carrying a piano accordion . President Hinkle was escorting him with all the deference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , closed his eyes in pain , and stood there , swaying , unable to speak . The VIP brushed past him . " Who in blazes is this man ? " he bellowed , cocking his head in Duckworth 's direction . President Hinkle , in a virtuoso gesture of mixed pride in Duckworth and truckling humility toward the VIP , said , " This is Dr. Duckworth , a Nobel laureate in Chemistry . Sometimes his zeal for social causes is misplaced . " Duckworth fixed a level , unintimidated gaze on the VIP . " My pleasure , sir , " he said , unsmiling . " And this , " added the President , gesturing toward the lederhosen-encased human sphere , " is Frederick Fuller , originator of the Fuller Foundation . " " A charitable trust ? " I offered , concealing my annoyance at being ignored . Fuller stiffened . " I 'm in ladies undergarments , " he said truculently . " I 'm also chairman of the University Board of Trustees , and president of Fuller Firearms Incorporated . " " Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's diversification , " he said coldly . Fuller was bristling at all the diversionary chitchat.  | " Why the hell did you stop our rifles from firing ? " he demanded of Duckworth . " I do n't like rifles and I do n't like the noise of shooting , " said Duckworth calmly . Fuller shuddered . Armbruster sat down heavily in Duckworth 's personal but battered armchair . President Hinkle edged forward and addressed himself to Duckworth . " Duckworth , " he said , his entire body swaying from side to side as though he were intoning one of his interminable convocation speeches , " do n't you know that Rifle teams teach our students respect for guns and for human life ? All the false ideas they gained as children , looking at television and playing with toy guns , are dispelled once and for all . " " Gun fees , " added Fuller , " pay for conservation . Are you against conservation , Duckworth ? " Armbruster pulled himself together and lifted out of the armchair . " And what about Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quavering . " The first thing Hitler did was to take away guns from the people . " " I know what you 're thinking , " added Fuller . " Guns kill people . But anything can kill people . " He lifted his accordion high over his head . " I could maim you with this accordion , " said Fuller . " Just do n't play it , " said Duckworth . Fuller began to choke , gestured once or twice with the accordion , and then stormed out of the lab . He was quickly followed by Professor Armbruster . President Hinkle looked at Duckworth sadly . " You ca n't behave this way , Duckworth , " he said . " I do n't like guns any more than you do . But they are still needed in this cruel , imperfect world . " Tears had come into his tiny eyes and I noticed that Duckworth seemed moved by his eloquence . He started  | to reply , but before he could say anything , Armbruster staggered back into the lab , gasping for breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. President , your office has been seized by a band of students . " Hinkle turned livid . " My office ? Why ? " " They demand that you reinstate Duckworth . " " But I have n't suspended him , " cried the President . I thought the moment ripe for sound advice . " Why not suspend him so you can reinstate him ? " I offered . But the President had gone , flying to relieve his besieged office . " That 's a hell of a mess you 've cooked up , old chum , " I said to Duckworth . But he was back at the bench , poring over his recorder readings , totally oblivious of anything I had to say . The following day , the students withdrew from Hinkle 's office and I sighed with relief . But I might well have saved the sigh . At four in the afternoon , a delegation arrived from the Pentagon . There was no doubt what mission they had come upon . An attempt was made to bar me from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He insisted that I be present at all discussions .

" " I keep Momine in tanks , " said Duckworth . " Test tubes , tanks , what the hell 's the difference ? "  | said the General . " What I mean is , you must turn your formula over to us . It 's a matter of Life or Death ! " " I 'll be glad to , " said Duckworth . I could n't believe my ears . " Duckworth , are you finking out ? " I whispered into his red-veined ear .

" One other thing , " said General Weathershaw . " We 'll have to impound your notebook and all other data pertaining to the development and production of Momine . " Duckworth smiled . " There 's no need to do that , sir , " he said sweetly . " I have an ample supply of reprints of my paper . It includes everything you 'll have to know . " " Reprints ? " cried the General . " You 've published al-ready ? " " About two months ago , " said Duckworth . " In the International Journal of Applied Chemistry .

" Momine has no effect  | on fission or fusion . Still , it should mean some peace and quiet around here and the survival of deer , partridges , and liberal politicians . " " Fuller may get you fired , " I warned . Duckworth shook his head confidently . " Not with Momine around , " he said . " From now on , everyone will have to hold his fire . "  | IT WAS HALLOWEEN and I was wending my unsteady way across Campus to my bachelor apartment . I had just come from the Faculty-Students Ball , a shivaree that had started slowly and gained tremendous momentum as the evening had spun on . Professor Laura Magi , a sharp-featured , gray-haired harridan who affected tight skirts and spike-heeled pumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening to convince her that I was not the Prince . President Hinkle had also enlivened the party with a harangue on the cost of running a University . I avoided colliding with a moving tree , and then I caught sight of the windows of Duckworth 's laboratory . A great sheet of orange light seemed to be pouring out . I stumbled over to the entrance to Chemistry Hall and with trembling fingers unlocked the outer door . I 'm as appreciative of student horseplay as the next man is , but not in the Chemistry labs . I groped my way down the corridor to Duckworth 's laboratory , guided by the unearthly glow . I had , thank  | God , enough presence of mind to rap on the door before breaking in , because it opened quietly with Duckworth standing there , framed in the orange light . He seemed to be quite pleased to see me , and quickly put my fears to rest . " It 's just my new synthetic Neon compound , " he said . " It has the most remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" I ca n't remove this stuff , " said Duckworth pensively . " I have to protect my hands very carefully . You see , I 've tried all the solvents I know without a bit of success . As a matter of fact , it 's the most amazing preservative I 've ever seen . Look over here . " A sweep of his arm indicated several small mammals , all dead , and all perfectly preserved . I rose to my feet and examined each one carefully . And then the inspiration hit me . " My God , Duckworth , " I cried . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Duckworth 's fluid , which I named Forever , sent a shudder through the Campus . Duckworth tried to play down his discovery . " Perhaps it only seems to be a perfect embalming fluid , " he said . I ignored this false modesty and sent out press releases to every wire service in the country . The response was immediate . The most interesting reply came from  | Mrs. Billy DeVere , widow of the recently demised showman . She came , in person , to plead with Duckworth , and it was one of his most difficult hours . She offered the University a huge endowment . " I 'm not an undertaker , Madame , " said Duckworth petulantly . She sat there , lovely in her mourning attire , a high bosom above a short black skirt . Duckworth nudged me . " Miniweeds , " he muttered in my ear . Mrs. DeVere lifted a tiny kerchief from her reddened eyes . " I 've built Billy the most gorgeous mausoleum , " she said . " I want him to last forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his frown softened . " Wo n't you do it for me ? " she said softly . Duckworth personally applied the fluid to Billy DeVere . It was a work of consummate artistry and I was almost moved to applause . " Fortunately , " said Duckworth , " he was a tiny fellow . Else I might have run out of the fluid . It would take months to make up another batch . " He turned on a small hair dryer and gently blew on the little chap . " There now , " he said . " He 's ready for the tomb . " As a gesture of heartfelt gratitude , both Duckworth and I were privileged to witness the dedication of DeVere 's last resting place . There were four magnificent stained-glass windows , six platinum plaques encrusted with precious stones , and a translucent coffin of perfumed amber . Duckworth was intrigued by two vents on the coffin , one located at each end . " What on earth could they be for ? " he mused .  | Flanagan , designer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad you asked , " he said . " Because of the many priceless objects within the tomb , I 've made the door burglar-proof . Then I began to worry about some visitor being trapped inside accidentally . " " I do n't quite see , " said Duckworth . " Blow into one of the coffin vents , " said Flanagan . Duckworth demurred , but I blew , and a sharp whistlelike blast pierced the air . Duckworth was intrigued . " Did you notice ? " he said . " DeVere plays the part of the pea in the police whistle . " It was great fun , too , trying to decipher the motifs of the stained-glass windows . " Those large spheroids stand for his first wife , " said Flanagan . " And that starched sheet is for the books he had ghostwritten . " Duckworth stared fixedly at a wavy horizontal line . " Was his second wife Chinese ? " he asked . But an outthrust thumb baffled both of us . Flanagan chuckled . " Billy was a butcher for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears even to the resistive eyes of Duckworth . It was delivered from a howdah atop an elephant 's back to commemorate DeVere 's greatest hit show . Even the elephant was moved , to the dismay of the groundkeeper . Just before we left , I stole a last fond look at little Billy . I almost lost my breath . " Duckworth , " I cried . " Look at him ! He 's glowing . " " Glowing ? " said Duckworth , his cheeks ashen . " It ca n't be . " Flanagan was at work on the amber coffin , prying the  | lid off , and when he had finished , we all noted that Billy DeVere was indeed aglow , bright as a neon sign . " That glow should only occur with a live man , " said Duckworth . " And DeVere is dead . " " Was dead , " said Flanagan , his ear to Billy 's chest . " I guess when we blew into the coffin , his heart started up again . All we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us again . " Duckworth shook his head . " What he wants to tell you , " I said , " is that , as yet , Duckworth has found no way of removing the fluid . " Despite our fears , Mrs. DeVere did not withdraw the five million endowment to the University . She even came , unheralded , to Duckworth 's office where they spent a secluded hour together . After she 'd gone , I went in to see Duckworth . He had a dreamy smile on his face . " Did she forgive you ? " I asked . " No , " said Duckworth . " But she did thank me. "  | I HAD JUST LEFT the Computer Center , when I ran into old Ashby in the hall . Ashby is one of the senior people in Chemistry , and his face was sheet-white as he leaned against the wall . I thought he might be having a heart attack . " Anything wrong ? " I asked anxiously . Ashby looked at me silently , his eyes clouded with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " Do you remember the name of that six-foot rabbit in the old play ? " " Do you mean Harvey ? " I said . " He was an invisible rabbit . " " Well this one 's six feet long and visible , " said Ashby . " I saw him in Duckworth 's lab . " As unobtrusively as I could , I sniffed the air just around Ashby 's mouth but I could detect no scent of booze . But then , I thought , it might just be senility . Nevertheless , my curiosity was piqued and I made straightway for the Chemistry building and Duckworth 's lab . His door was locked but there was a dim  | glow over the transom . I hesitated for a moment and then knocked . There was no answer . I knocked again and a shuffle of steps approached the door . It opened and Duckworth peered out , clearly annoyed . But his face brightened when he saw me and he waved at me in a friendly manner . " Come in , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of something . " I followed on tiptoe , drawing on experience gained in the fourth-year kindergarten many years back . I had been in these hallowed surroundings before , but I had never lost the sense of reverence at seeing Duckworth 's complex maze of apparatus . There was a mass spectrometer in one small room , a countercurrent apparatus of many glass curves and bends , and beyond that a microscope stand into which Duckworth was gazing . I took a seat nearby and sat quietly . After a while , Duckworth entered some penciled notes into a stained gray binder , sighed contentedly , and turned to me . " I suppose you 've run into that idiot , Ashby , " he said . I was startled at his reading of my thoughts . I coughed in embarrassment . " I did see him in the corridor outside the Computer room , " I said . " He 's an ass , " said Duckworth . " I showed him an amazing thing , a bead and wire model of a new complex molecule I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for growing an entire living organism . Ashby stared at it for a while and then he said , Somebody 's going to poke out their eyes on that wire . ' " I smiled . " He mentioned something about a six-foot rabbit , " I said . Duckworth frowned .  | " Oh , Emma , " he said . " I suppose the secret 's out now . Come along and I 'll show her to you . " He led me through a side corridor into his Animal room . He opened the door in a gingerly manner , fumbling for the light switch , and then it flicked on . I almost leaped out of my skin . There , working its nostril whiskers amiably , was the biggest rabbit I 'd ever seen . " What do you think of her ? " asked Duckworth . " God she 's big ! " " A slight miscalculation on my part , " said Duckworth . " But look at those gorgeous blue eyes and the snow white fur . " " She is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get past her size . " " Do n't get hung up on her length , " said Duckworth . " The important thing is , l made her . " The room reeled about me . I steadied myself on what I thought was Duckworth 's shoulder until I realized I was holding on to the rabbit . I recoiled , as if from an adder . " What do you mean , made her ? " I said . Duckworth sighed . " Everyone reacts in the same way , " he said . " I told you I had a new complex molecule from which I could grow a living organism . It was the logical next step from my macromolecule , which was so like the RNA-DNA complexes . I decided to work out a way of formulating my own genetic coding and create something according to blueprint . " " And the rabbit was your first try ? " " Emma was my fifth , " said Duckworth . " But she 's the first to develop into a viable creature . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've cracked the greatest secret of the Ages . Why have n't you announced it ? " " Too many ramifications , " said Duckworth . " Besides ,  | I 've got one Nobel Prize in Chemistry . I do n't think 1 could get another . " I pulled out my handkerchief and wiped my brow but the sweat popped out afresh . " My God , " I said . " Wait till the ecclesiastical types hear what you 've done . " " That 's why I 've kept it quiet , " said Duckworth . And then a sudden thought struck me . I hesitated to voice it . " Is it now possible , " I said tentatively , " to create some kind of human creature ? " Duckworth stroked his beard calmly . " Odd that you should ask that , " he said . " The preparation I was examining when you came in is just that . " I shook my head violently . " You 've gone much too far , " I said . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at a very early and tricky stage of development just now . There are cells in the process of dividing . At the moment , they are in the blastocyst stage . I 've got to supply a pseudo uterus for anchoring . It will be a couple of months before it will look human . " " What color will the baby be ? " I said . Duckworth shrugged . " I did n't give a thought to color , " he said . " It will eventually be a white female . " " Ah ha , " I said . " You did n't think about color but you chose white . That will open you to the charge of racism . " Duckworth 's eyes widened . " I suppose you 're right , " he said pensively . " Most of the world is non-white . I probably should have made her black . " " Then you 'd have been accused of condescension , or at best , of appeasing the ghettos. "  | " I ca n't win either way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . Then present Emma to the world . That rabbit should be enough for starters . " " You mean kill the embryo ? I could n't do that , " said Duckworth . " It 's alive . " I sighed . " Good God , Duckworth . People have had abortions before . There are circumstances which make it perfectly proper . " " Not to me , " said Duckworth . And his jaw set in a manner I 'd seen before . It was clear that further argument was futile . We both sat there , silently , brooding over what had taken place , and then Duckworth 's innate optimism won out . " It will all work out , " he said . " Wait and see . " " What about President Hinkle ? Does he know what you 've done ? " " No one but Ashby and you , " said Duckworth . " I underestimated Ashby 's loquacity and your strong ethical code . " " You 'd better tell the President before he gets it indirectly . And quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate like hell to do it , " he said . " But I suppose you 're right . I 'll let him know today . " It took some convincing but I finally persuaded Duckworth that it would n't do to tie a bright pink ribbon about the Rabbit 's neck and set a basket of colored eggs at her side . He muttered something about my lack of humor and went to the phone to dial the President 's office . I can still see the look on President Hinkle 's face when he came into the lab . Right behind him was his secretary , Myrna , and I was in position to catch her as she fell backward .  | President Hinkle kept muttering , " Goddam , " as Duckworth patiently described what he had done . He also avoided looking at the Rabbit , although every now and then he sneaked a side glance at her . I kept patting Myrna 's wrists and chafing her temples until she came to . Duckworth had paused , and I assumed that he was about to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slowly backed out of the room and beat it the hell out of the Chemistry building . I went home , turned on my television set , and watched the basketball game of the week . It was wild , exciting , with some of the finest defensive play I 'd ever seen . But I was waiting for something else , and it came . During overtime , a small line of news flashes suddenly broke at the bottom of the picture . The name of Duckworth appeared , " secrets of life discovered , " and a lengthy quote from President Hinkle . I switched off the set and decided to make amends for my cowardice and get back to the side of my friend . When I arrived at Campus , an enormous mob was there , held back by the biggest array of state troopers I 'd ever seen . For a moment I was totally perplexed . - We already had a black-run department of African Culture , two hundred black students , and four courses in Swahili . Then I realized that the TV flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make no headway through the lines . Then I saw a guilty looking chap ease out from under the barricades , gingerly balancing a small package . He was neatly dressed and clean shaven , but I recognized Duckworth at once . He clapped his hand over my mouth before I could shout his name , and we stumbled off together . When we had gotten some distance from the crowd , I pried his fingers from my mouth . " Why are you running away ? " I asked .  | " Have you got a better idea ? " he snarled . " There were twenty television cameras turned on me and a deadly stream of the most idiotic questions . Besides , I did n't want them to find out about the embryo . " He pointed to the package . " Is it in there ? " Duckworth nodded . " Did n't you tell Hinkle about her ? " I said . His shoulders sagged . " I could n't , " said Duckworth . " I decided the only way to handle this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it develop to full maturity , and then publish the information in a scientific journal . " " And the Rabbit ? " " Hinkle will be good to her , " said Duckworth . " Some day , when Emma is older , she 'll understand why I had to abandon her . " " It 's a mistake , Duckworth , " I said . " Eating in diners , sneaking chemicals from the corner drugstore , holing up in the High Sierras . It wo n't work . " Duckworth chewed on his lower lip . " There is another way , " he said pensively . " I could have Laura Lockman look after the embryo at her apartment . " Laura Lockman , your graduate student ? Does she know about the human embryo ? " " Not officially , " said Duckworth , " but I think she 's on to what I 've been doing . I 'm sure she 'd help and we 'd only require a minimum of equipment at her place . " And that 's what we did . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd slip me a little black and white photograph to look at . " Notice , " she said , " it 's now about one-quarter inch long . That tiny tube is the heart , and it 's beating strongly . " Five weeks later , she pointed out the head , the begin-  | ning of fingernails , the tiny closed eyelids . It was fascinating and chilling . Month by month it developed , from embryo to fetus , fetus to an about-to-be-born baby . The most difficult part , I gathered , was the special membranous amnion that Duckworth devised out of a selectively permeable plastic material . On the academic front , Duckworth was constantly plagued by visitors , invitations to television interviews , and correspondence from the National Institutes of Health , asking him to gather his ideas and techniques into a monograph on creation of life . " It 's hopeless , " said Duckworth to me one morning . " Between all this harassment , sneaking over to Laura 's apartment , and maintaining my research here , I 'm exhausted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I would n't miss you for the world , " I said . " Specially since a contingent of Fundamentalist Churchwomen is promising to disrupt the proceedings . " " Do you really think so ? " said Duckworth wistfully , his face brightening for the first time in weeks . " God , I hope they do ! " But they did n't . The dinner proceeded mechanically along its predestined dull path . President Hinkle , in a flowery introduction , outlined his own career and capped it with his penetrating discovery of Duckworth teaching chemistry and coaching basketball at a small girls ' college in the Berkshires . As Duckworth arose , spreading his spidery fingers through the wrinkled notes of his speech , an usher came quickly down the aisle and pressed a note into his hand . He read it , turned livid beneath his newly restored beard , and bolted from the dais . I clutched at his tuxedo as he went by . " Duckworth , " I cried . " What 's happened ? " " It 's Laura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The baby is being born ! "  | President Hinkle had also jumped to his feet and waddled over to me . " Where 's he going ? " he whispered hoarsely . " He 's disrupting the dinner . " " It 's the baby , " I said without thinking . " He 's got to go to Laura Lockman at once . " President Hinkle stared at me , thunderstruck . " Baby ? " he cried . " Duckworth ? Laura ? I ca n't believe it . The scandal could destroy the University ! " And he fell heavily into a nearby seat without giving its occupant a chance to get out from under . The dinner ended in confusion , amid wild distortions of why Duckworth had left precipitately . Indeed , to this day there are those who still insist that Duckworth produced the infant by a rather standard approach . But the academic world knew better . The excitement and adulation that followed the publicizing of Duckworth 's rabbit was nothing compared to what erupted on the announcement that a girl baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raging moral issues underlying artificial creation were debated across every breakfast table . But Duckworth seemed impervious to all of this furor . He called me aside one morning to show me three 6 x 8 free photos of the baby that had come with the diaper service . " It 's amazing , Duckworth , " I said . " You 've kept your balance and avoided a display of hubris . Why sometimes even I feel overwhelmed by it all . " " I ca n't afford to be , " said Duckworth . " I 've a new mouth to feed now . And besides , a certain high Government official is meeting with me this afternoon . It 's all very hushhush , but I refused to come unless you were present . After I 'd ignored the reasons detailing why you ca n't get a security clearance , they reluctantly agreed . Will you come ? " " I 'm flattered , " I said . " But what help can I offer ? "  | " I have an idea of what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , I think I 'll need your moral support . " I was apprehensive all through the preliminaries of the meeting . Mr. Hubbard of the Defense Department , was surrounded by a half dozen of his brightest aides . On our side was President Hinkle , his secretary , Myrna , Duckworth , and myself . Mr. Hubbard , in glowing terms , began to outline a vast grant program involving millions for the University , with Duckworth heading a new Chemical Research building . Duckworth looked at me , eyebrows raised . I shrugged . " What do you get in return ? " asked Duckworth quietly . Mr. Hubbard smiled . " Not me , " he said . " Uncle Sam . He 's wise enough not to tell Emmett Duckworth what to do . But we do have one little specific project in mind . " He paused , shuffled his papers , cleared his throat , and went on . " Dr. Duckworth , " he said , " the Government would like you to produce a test run of fifty male babies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies ? " said Duckworth . " But why ? " Mr. Hubbard looked around the room . " There are a considerable number of us present , " he said . " Could this be just between you and me ? " President Hinkle arose , swaying like a seal , his pride clearly injured . " I 'm ready to go , " he said , his voice breaking . The six aides to Mr. Hubbard jumped up quickly . " He stays , " said Duckworth , pointing at me . Hubbard hesitated , frowned , then nodded , and in short order the three of us were alone . " Now , " said Hubbard , " in my portfolio is a fully  | detailed program . I 've been working on it since the announcement about your six-foot rabbit . I knew that eventually you 'd have to produce a human child . " He glanced down at his papers . " It 's taken me many months of arduous work . " " No doubt , " said Duckworth drily . " Briefly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our Nation has been frustrated and held back in its military policy by the fear of deaths among our military personnel . Some observers feel that one of our Presidents was driven from office because of casualty lists and the resulting resistance to the draft . Every mother whose son may be sent into battle becomes a potential propagandist against the Government . But she 'd be quite placid if she knew that her sons would never have to go to war . " " Meaning ? " said Duckworth . " If we had a group of youngsters comprising our Armed Forces , all without family ties , real and yet not real , belonging to no one but Uncle Sam , there 'd be no protests , sit-ins , or demonstrations if they died in battle . It would be the ultimate solution of our military manpower problem at minimal cost . " I sucked in my breath . Duckworth looked at me and placed his hand on my shoulder . " As I understand you , " he said severely , " you want to use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy and Air Force , " said Hubbard . " It should be child 's play for you , " he added , " and no pun intended . You might even give us youngsters predesigned with particular aptitudes for the military life . " Duckworth stood up and I joined him . " The answer is no , " he said . " Forget the idea . I 'll never cooperate with you . " " Bravo , Duckworth , " I murmured .  | Hubbard ignored me . He looked at Duckworth and sighed . " I was afraid you might react this way , " he said . " I know you think you 're taking a moral stand , but you 're wrong . Do you want to condemn real youngsters to death ? " " I want no youngsters to die , " said Duckworth . Hubbard gathered his papers together . " You realize , " he said , " that we can proceed without you . I took the precaution before this meeting of impounding your notebooks under the National Security Act . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on your notes . " " I do n't doubt that you 'll find biochemists to help you , " said Duckworth . " But it will take quite a while before you 'll get what you want . " Hubbard smiled . " Perhaps , we 'll see . " Duckworth leaned forward . " Could you use an entire army of women ? " Hubbard frowned . " Why women ? " " Because as yet I 've been unable to produce a male , " said Duckworth , " a problem in synthesizing a perfect Y chromosome . I have n't the foggiest notion of how to solve it . " " You 're bluffing , " said Hubbard . " Ask your chemists , " said Duckworth . " And while they spend ten years digging up the answer , maybe I can scuttle your plan . " Later , as we walked under the fragrant pines that bordered the Campus , I congratulated Duckworth on his stand . " Imagine that S.O.B . calling my little girl unreal , " he said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess  | I 've gotten into . But Science does n't produce evil consequences , only men do . " And for the rest of the afternoon , Duckworth and I pooled our intellects and went through a list of four hundred girls ' names without finding a single one we could agree upon .  | I WAS INDULGING my hobby and tracking marine iguana in the Galapagos when the news flash came through . Senator Maynard had been shot down right on the Senate floor by a lunatic bystander in the gallery . It ruined my vacation . Once again the Nation was stunned and took to its television sets for the catharsis of a prolonged and somber funeral . The reaction of Congress , for once , was swift . Gun control was of course out of the question . But after a brief and highly emotional debate , it was decided to close Congress to visitors . In addition , a rider was added stipulating that henceforth all candidates for Federal office were to conduct their campaigns on television . Under no circumstances were they to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was this rider that almost ruined me . As the head of the leading publicity and advertising firm in the country , and the acknowledged master of the multimedia , I had landed Clint Speare as my client . Clint was an Oklahoman , owner of uncounted oil wells , and reputed  | to be worth several hundred millions . He ran perennially for the Presidential nomination and had never gotten it , although in each case he 'd spent a small fortune trying . I liked Clint . He was no intellectual and had a limited grasp of the subtleties of domestic and international politics but he knew how to multiply dollars . And there was a huge bonus in the pot if I could get him the Presidency . As soon as I returned to New York , I called Clint and told him it was important for us to get together that evening . He sensed the urgency in my voice and agreed . I arrived with Al Dix , my confidant and general business major-domo . Clint Speare was a hospitable host , short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a booming laugh that had the ring of sincerity . He held his liquor magnificently even though he had consumed a full quart over a three-hour period . " Al must have told you , " he said , shortly after we walked in . " This time I mean to win . I 've never felt as confident and Al agrees that my chances are very good . " " What I meant , was the following , " said Al Dix , looking at me a little ruefully . His rimless glasses gave him the look of an earnest schoolteacher as he began to play with the hotel silverware on the snow white tablecloth . " Clint projects superbly , in person . Turn him loose to press the flesh and he communicates his integrity to every man , woman , and child in the street . If we key him to talking about the issues that are in everyone 's heart , he definitely could make it . " " I agree , " I interjected . " But to put it bluntly , when Clint goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifty eyed politician . And now that Congress has banned in-person campaigning , we 're really in trouble . "  | Clint 's face grew somber . " I just do n't feel natural in front of those cameras , " he said . I looked at Al Dix and he looked at me . We both sighed . Suddenly Clint brightened . " We 're not licked yet , boys , " he said , pouring us each another round of drinks . " You 'll come up with something . And you know why ? Because there 's too much money at the end of that rainbow . " For days thereafter , I ran over several possibilities in my mind , but prospects were bleak . Clint Speare was not my only client , but he provided most of our bread . I was overfocused on his problem , so much so that I found it hard to concentrate on other matters . It could only have been for this reason that I agreed to visit a small beat-up East Side theater , to see a demonstration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater , I saw Al Dix coming up the aisle with a tall , handsome black man . We shook hands warmly . " This is Sam Carsons , " said Al . " I know , " I said . " Sam and I are old friends . " " It 's been fifteen years , " said Sam . " Are you still bugged on lizards ? " " It helps me relax , " I said and we both grinned at memories of desert field trips in another era . " How is Lillian ? " I added . " And the kids ? " Sam shrugged . " We 're divorced . " His fingers began to tremble , ever so slightly . It was an awkward moment and Al solved it neatly . " Let me tell you about Sam 's new system , " he said . He sat me down in one of the center orchestra seats and fastened a small bracelet to my arm and a clip to my ear lobe .  | " Sam has wedded an old idea to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensors . They monitor your skin resistance , pulse rate , arterial pressure , and blood gases and tell us if you 're angry , indifferent , happy , excited , and so on . This information is telemetered to a receiver backstage and processed by computer . " " Let me take over , " said Sam . He looked at me with the beginning of a smile on his lips . " Would you like to see your father ? " he said . I was jolted . " My father ? " " Well start , " said Sam , " by projecting a three-dimensional image of a man on to stage center . It 's done by a holographic process and you might be fooled into thinking it was a real man . At first , he wo n't look a bit like your father . But I 'll call out , nose . Depending on whether or not you think his nose is like your father 's , it will begin to change until it is exactly like your father 's nose . Then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was intrigued but skeptical . " Let 's try it , " I said . The nose took form with surprising speed , then the eyes , the chin , ears , and hair styling . The complexion followed . Then I worked on the arms , posture , height , and body shape . Within minutes my father looked out at me from the stage , big and frightening as he 'd been in life . " Uncanny , " I said . My throat was choked and my heart was pounding . " I developed this system , " said Sam , " with the idea of selling it to the various Missing Persons Bureaus around the country . It seemed to me to be a hell of a lot better than having an artist sketch from verbal description . " " Then , " said Al Dix , " it occurred to him that he had a neat way of determining the best package for a perfume or a breakfast food . A computer stores all of the  | choices , and depending on how the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by step to the most desirable form . " " It 's a powerful idea , " I said , still shaken by that man on stage who seemed to be my father . " What a pity it has no sound ! " " But it has ! " said Sam . " Let 's take your Dad one step further . " I was startled as the image began a rambling statement on the weather , in high-pitched falsetto . Then the voice began to deepen as I reacted . It shifted an octave lower . Next it developed a slight quaver , ultimately arriving at a thickening of the s 's , adopting a New England twang , and my shock was complete . The total reproduction of my father in form and voice was unnerving . " It 's witchcraft , " I told Sam , and he grew inches taller . Al Dix was beaming as we shook hands all around . I looked at him for a moment and then a new connection suddenly went through . " It 's here , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problem right in this auditorium . " Al looked at me , puzzled . " Do n't you see ? " I said , grabbing his arm with ferocious intensity . " By using representative audiences , we can find out exactly what Clint must say to please them . We can film these sessions , cut it into edited one-minute tapes , and spot them on television . " Al caught the idea immediately . " It 's wild , " he said . " But it might work . " " Wait a minute , " said Sam . " I 'd like to know what 's going on . " I told him the truth , but not all of it . I did n't think it expedient yet . Sam was reluctant .  | " It 's not what I had in mind , " he said . " I figured on packaging products , not people . " " Give it a try , " I said . " I want a six-month option . At the end of that time , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . And I 'll pay you well , more than you ever dreamed of . " " Let me think it over , " said Sam . I walked outside with Al Dix and I sketched out some of the things I wanted to do with this system . Al added some of his own ideas and our excitement began to build even further . After a suitable time , I reentered the auditorium . Sam was still sitting there , but onstage was Lillian , Sam 's ex-wife , as lovely as I 'd remembered her . The deep brown skin had a lustrous sheen . I backed out of the auditorium , waited a few minutes longer , and then called out before going inside . Lillian was offstage now , although in another sense her image had n't been on it . Having met her several times , I knew that she was white . " I still have my doubts , " said Sam , " but as long as I hold full rights to withdraw my system after a sixmonth trial , I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our first live audience of two hundred viewers was made up of carefully chosen members of the suburban middle class . I can still see the pseudo Clint Speare as he appeared onstage . His voice was affirmative , strong , and his gaze level and direct . His ideas were at first vague , shapeless , with just a hint of something concrete underlying each point . He attacked crime in the streets , poverty , corruption in high places , disrespect to elders , the high cost of living , unfaithful allies , and the bankrupt policy of the current National Administration . But then he began to heat up . His statements became more biting and he began to attack minority elements  | by name , his voice became passionate , and the audience was aflame with excitement . I watched the real Clint Speare at my side , and it was amazing to see how he mimicked the projection onstage . The audience had narrowed the nostrils of the speaker slightly , and Clint Speare narrowed his . In some incredible way , he was adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudo Clint Speare . And he began to mutter , sotto voce , right along with the speaker , the words and phrases paralleling what came through to the audience . Afterward , he was elated . " Did you see that ? " he kept saying . He was too excited to sit down . " Remember , " I warned . " That rousing ovation was n't really for you . They were applauding themselves . And left to themselves they might abolish welfare , legislate restrictive housing , segregated schooling , the works . " " I intend to give them what they want , " said Speare . " Do n't be a fool , " I said . " There are other audiences . You 've got to be something more than the man we saw on stage tonight . " Sam had said nothing but now he opened up . " It was sickening , " he said . " I was skeptical about this deal when it started , and I did n't know the half of it then . I 'm pulling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clint . " I 'm no bigot . I 'll satisfy all of the people . " " Sam , " I said , " do n't be hasty . You still have the right to withdraw after six months . But I have another test planned that I think you 'd enjoy seeing . I want to set up our next speech before an all black audience . " They were restive at the beginning until Clint Speare seemed to appear on stage . His appearance began to alter in subtle but important ways . The nostrils were broader , the skin a little darker , the hair more curly . The actions became broader , the voice intoned more  | rhythmically , and an impassioned plea for equal treatment under the law , in housing , schooling , and jobs came from the mouth of the pseudo Clint Speare . At my side , the real Clint had taken on the look of the reconstructed stage figure , and was going along vocally with everything the speaker said . The close of the speech was greeted with an impassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats . Afterward , Sam asked Clint how he had reacted to the audience . " How do you feel about today 's speech as compared to the last one ? " " I stand behind everything the man said onstage , " said Clint . Sam was nonplussed . " How can you ? A certain amount of hedging is normal , but outright contradictions do n't make sense . If one of these groups gets wind of what you 're saying to the other , they 'll cut you to pieces . " " That will never happen , " said Clint . " I do n't need that man onstage . I can sense what people want to hear . I 'd like to go up there on my own , next time , with an audience that represents everybody . " " Not yet , " I said . " You 'd be getting ahead of the game . " " It wo n't wash for me , " said Sam . " I never meant to create a human chameleon . I 'm going to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't knock chameleons , " I said . " Besides , this system has gotten too big for petty squabbles . I 'll be glad to pay you a fortune in royalties if you stay with us . But if you pull out , I still wo n't let go . You 're a pretty sharp man , but I can buy all the brains I need to keep this thing going , and I will . " " You 'd be infringing on my patent rights and breaking our agreement , " said Sam . " I 'd beat you in court . " I laughed . " Go ahead , " I said . " And in fifteen years I 'd be  | forced to give you what I would have paid you anyway . And that 's only if you win . Do you have the time and the money to buck my high-powered lawyers ? " He was silent . I thought of the time , seventeen years back , when Sam and I had been at college together . We 'd held the Dean 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be smart , Sam , " I said . " I do n't want to do this . But I will if I have to . Do n't make me , for old times ' sake . " " Old times ' sake , " he snorted , and walked out of the auditorium . " What 's he going to do ? " said Al Dix . " He 'll stick , " I said . " But I do n't trust him any longer . I want another programmer put on this project right away . I want every move that Sam makes checked and double checked . I do n't want anybody or anything sabotaging our next meeting . " " What kind of a meeting is that going to be ? " asked Clint Speare . " We 're going to run one more test with two hundred people chosen to match the entire national voting population . Let 's see how our system works then ! " It was clear that we could no longer count on Sam 's help . He rarely appeared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to biting remarks about amateur zoologists playing with human specimens . But he came to the key meeting . The audience was strikingly different from those we 'd used before , weighted perfectly for income , age , color , and religion . Clint Speare was more jittery than I 'd ever anticipated he could be . And then , suddenly , I lost control . Just before the speech began , I became nauseated from the tension and had to leave the auditorium . I spent ten painful minutes turning myself inside out . When I came back , the air  | had filled with shock , and the figure of the pseudo Clint Speare onstage was immobile and silent . I grabbed Al Dix 's arm . " What 's going on ? " I cried . " That 's really Clint up there , " he said . " The damn fool ran onstage . He wanted to prove that he 'd caught the true feelings of the entire nation . But when he got up there , he just seemed to freeze , as if all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Get him off the stage , " I said . " Get him off at once . " We did , but it was too late . Clint had gone through a nervous shock that had disintegrated all of his controls . It was clear that he would probably require hospitalization and extended treatment . As he was carried out to a waiting ambulance , I noticed that Sam was one of the stretcher bearers . When he came back , I stopped him . " I guess you won out , after all , " I said . " I did n't win a goddam thing , " he said . " I never hated Clint personally , although it was clear that he was n't fit for any office , let alone President . But you 're the lizard man . You should have had the foresight to see what might happen . " " Foresight ? To see what ? " " To visualize , " said Sam slowly , " what happens when you put a chameleon on a plaid . "  | I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was frightening to have it confirmed from his own lips . The great biochemist for some time had given up his research activities , unnerved by the near tragic consequences of his macromolecule . He took to long walks in the countryside with a knapsack loaded with wine bottles and an occasional slice of bread . His long unkempt hair was , of course , unnoticed on Campus , and his lectures if anything were more popular than ever . His wit was still biting even if his speech had somewhat thickened . And he still loved to gently pinch the rumps of the eager coeds who crowded about him after class . He caught me in the faculty cafeteria one day , eating a cottage cheese salad and drinking black coffee . He smiled at me knowingly . " On the chubby diet again ? " He patted his flat waistline , smirking all the while . " I eat what I want when I want it , " he said . " Fat chance of getting anything solid into your stom-  | ach , " I snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duckworth seemed unperturbed at my barb . " That 's the trouble with you teetotalers , " he said genially . " The Elves were talking about it the other day . " At first I thought I had heard wrong . " Elves ? " I said . " And Gnomes , " added Duckworth solemnly . " They 're both in complete agreement on this score . Although , " he added , sighing , " they 're not always ready to accept one another 's views . " " Elves and Gnomes ? You 've seen them ? Talked to them ? " I said . " Frequently , " said Duckworth . " Still , they 're not the best of company . They tend to be dogmatic . " I gulped down my coffee and scalded the roof of my mouth . I also attempted to edge my tray away from his . " It 's funny , " said Duckworth , stroking his straggly beard . " For years , there has been a spate of reports on alleged sightings of flying saucers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been utter nonsense . " " Of course , " I said . " But , " resumed Duckworth , " the crowning irony has been the neglect of the really important clandestine guests , the visitors from Inner Space . " I could n't help it . I smiled broadly . Duckworth , who had been sinking his yellowed teeth into a huge jelly cruller , stopped to wag his finger at me . " Let me remind you , " he said , " that the eminent English astronomer Edmund Halley wrote in 1692 about inner shells within the Earth , including the innermost solid sphere ( about the size of the planet Mercury ) , capable of bearing life . "  | He chewed on the cruller for a bit , emitting sighs of pleasure , and then resumed his remarks . " The Northern lights , which you have written a monograph about , were also explained by Halley . " He had probed a sore spot in reminding me that I had deserted physics for computers . " I know , " I growled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights are supposedly due to the escape of a luminous gas which is really the atmosphere of the inner planet . The thinner crust at the Poles allows this gas to escape from time to time . " " Bravo , " cried Duckworth , and began on his second cruller . " Are you claiming , " I said in exasperation , " that you 've actually talked with these visitors ? " Duckworth licked the jelly off his fingers before replying . " They 're all around you , " he said amiably . " Do n't you realize that with our students growing long hair and raggedy beards , the little people have no trouble at all in passing at the University ? " " What about their size ? " I said critically . " And the curled , upturned toes ? " " Your sarcasm is misplaced , " said Duckworth . " Have you taken a good look at Rickstein ? " I jumped to my feet . Rickstein was the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts . A rather tiny man , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're out of your mind , Duckworth , " I cried . And then he did it . From inside of his grimy tweed jacket , he produced the most gorgeous pearl I 'd ever seen , and casually dropped it into my sweating palm . At that moment I 'd have sold my soul for a jeweler 's loupe but it was evident , even to the naked eye , that this was a pearl among pearls . Duckworth reached over , retrieved the pearl , and before I could stop him , dropped it into a glass of wine . A cry strangled in my throat .  | " Do n't carry on , " said Duckworth . " The Dean gave it to me . He 's got tons of jewels . " I was too shaken to carry on the conversation after that and muttering an excuse about a conference with a student , I departed . But later , I found myself outside the Dean 's office . Eying him out of the corners of my lids , I could see he was an imposing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he also sported a neatly kempt reddish beard . He beckoned to me , and I gingerly went into his inner sanctum . " Duckworth been talking out of turn ? " he said . I blanched . Could the little beggar be reading my mind ? " The answer is yes , " said the Dean . " How else could I have forestalled a student takeover of my office last month by tacking up Wet Paint signs ? " I could n't answer . " Do n't be frightened , " said the Dean . " Usually I tell this tale to occupants of stalled cars on desolate mountain roads . But since Duckworth has spilled the beans , I 'll tell you , too . I can rely on your discretion , of course . " " Of course , " I said . The Dean picked up and fondled a small solid gold paperweight . It was a replica of a pickax . " A reminder of the good old days , " he said nostalgically . " Of course , Inner Space is no picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with the average age of Gnomes a thousand years or so , you can imagine what it 's like inside . " I nodded . " Well , let 's get down to business , " said the Dean briskly . " What will you take to keep your mouth shut ? The gift of prophecy ? A golden tongue ? Or a gorgeous pearl like Duckworth asked for ? " " Duckworth blackmailed you into giving him that pearl ? " I said . I shook my head in disbelief .  | " Blackmailed is a crude word , " said the Dean . " Cajoled might be more appropriate . " " He dissolved the pearl in a cup of wine , " I said mournfully . " That 's what comes of seeing Hamlet too often , " said the Dean . " That pearl was without price . " He reached into his drawer and retrieved a chamois sack , emptying its contents on his desktop . My eyes bulged . There were huge diamonds , pearls , emeralds , and rubies scattered in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hesitated . " Come on , " he said genially . " You can even have two . " I took a diamond and a ruby . Neither , I knew , would dissolve in wine . Then I put them back . " Why hesitate ? " said the Dean . " Do you want a third ? " " I 'm not greedy . But what am I committing myself to ? Are the Gnomes and Elves planning to take over Outer Earth ? If so , I ca n't stand by passively . " " Do n't be so dramatic , " said the Dean . " All we want is to be left alone in a little breathing space . " " I 'll think it over , " I said . Later , I sought out Duckworth . " What did the Dean offer you ? " asked Duckworth . " A diamond and a ruby , " I said . " But how did you know ? " " You did n't take it , " said Duckworth . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty bribe from a Gnome . " " I thought he was an Elf , " I said . " Elves have no treasure , " said Duckworth scornfully . I flushed to the roots . " I 'm confused , " I said . " I do n't know what to do . "  | " Just stay away from the Fuzz , " said Duckworth . " This is an academic matter . " " Shall I bring him before the Faculty Council on charges of being a Gnome ? " " Why not ? " said Duckworth . " I 'll bet he did n't put that piece of information in his Curriculum Vita . " " But he wants to take over the Earth ! " " Just a small piece of it , " said Duckworth . " Take his jewels . You can build yourself the biggest goddam particle accelerator in the world . It 's the opportunity of your lifetime . " I sighed and shook my head . Duckworth walked away , exuding contempt from every pore . One week later , Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was deported along with thirty of our shortest students . I went into Duckworth 's laboratory and he smiled at me , knowingly . " I did n't do it , I swear , " I said . " I know you did n't , " said Duckworth . " I did . " " But you asked me to keep quiet about it . " " Just testing you , " said Duckworth . " And you were true blue as ever . We could n't let these little bastards take over . It 's hard enough to find an apartment as is . And if the ceilings got any lower ... " We both shuddered . " How did you do it ? " " One of our trustees is head of the Diamond Syndicate . A whisper about free precious stones and he sensed what it could do to the market price of his uncut diamonds . The rest is history . " I should have been happy , but instead I was depressed . " What the hell , " said Duckworth . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . " After the fifth bottle , I agreed with him .  | I WAS IN DUCKWORTH 'S LAB one afternoon , boring him with the details of a new computer program I 'd written , when I heard a radio flash on a sniper shooting several people at a Southern campus . Although Duckworth had been pretending to be wholly absorbed in a spectrophotometric measurement , he too caught the message . His black eyes lifted to mine and he shook his head sadly . " It 's just too much for me , " I said . " One violent act follows another . " " All a matter of time and place , " said Duckworth gently . For a moment I was annoyed . " I suppose that 's meant to sound profound , " I said . " But the message eludes me . " " Simply this , " said Duckworth . " Take that same sniper out of his tree on that campus , and put him in a tree in an Asian jungle , and his actions would become socially desirable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Honor . " I nodded dumbly , for Duckworth 's logic had me  | stumped , momentarily . Later , over a cocktail at the faculty bar , I pursued the point . " Your argument smacks of sophistry , " I said . " You might as well claim that a man setting fire to a theater would be performing a socially useful act if he were lighting the stove at home . " " I 'll go one step further , " said Duckworth . " Ideas , suggestions , and proposals that sound silly to you at this University , might be justifiably acclaimed elsewhere . " He never got to elaborate on this point , because a special delivery letter arrived at that very moment . It was postmarked from the White House . Duckworth read it through with a grave face . " My country needs me , " he said , placing his hand over the breast pocket in his white smock . " How can I refuse ? " " Even if it means participating in a dirty war ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and I walked away , fuming . Duckworth was given an indefinite leave of absence . The students had mixed feelings about his departure . Placards blossomed in front of his laboratory building , some reading , DO N'T DO IT , DUCKWORTH . Others , including the one I carried , read , DUCKWORTH IS AN ESTABLISHMENT FINK . In several months , Duckworth was just a memory on Campus and a dim one at that . But the personality of my old comrade-in-arms was still vivid in my mind . I wondered if I had judged him too harshly and what he was doing at his new post . As if some telepathic link had been established , a note arrived from Duckworth , almost pleading with me to pay him a visit . I agonized over this invitation . My affection for Duckworth was still strong , but I feared that his new  | research might rouse violent feelings . But I was also profoundly curious . I decided to go and Duckworth was overjoyed to see me . " I 've missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow-white buildings , I 'm surrounded by clutches of yes-men . " " I 've missed you , too , " I admitted . " And I hope you 'll be returning to the ivied halls of Academe pretty soon . " Duckworth smiled . " Sooner than you might think , " he said . He insisted on escorting me about the grounds of the enclave where he worked , despite the tough security regulations . We stopped in front of an enormous plane hangar , and Duckworth led me past the uniformed guards . " In here you 'll find one of my hottest projects . " I stretched my neck upward and stared in disbelief at a huge metal cylinder which was inside an even larger glass bell . " My God , " I said . " What is it ? " " A variant of the Tibetan torture drum , " said Duckworth . " It produces a vibratory note so violently painful to the auditory nerve , that we dare n't even test it . " " You have a use for this drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Duckworth . " We plan to set up an enormous parabolic reflector in a jungle clearing . The torture drum will be set at its focal point and the striking mechanism activated . Every guerrilla , for miles around , will find his nerves turned to quivering jelly . " I shuddered . " It 's gruesome and a perversion of Science , but it 's ingenious , " I admitted . Duckworth coughed . " There 's one bug , " he said . " And that is ? " " Notice , " said Duckworth , " that the drum is inside a  | glass bell . The air within the bell is pumped out and a near vacuum exists . That , of course , is to prevent accidental drum vibrations shattering our own people . " " Of course , " I said . " The drum , " resumed Duckworth , " must be transported inside a total vacuum . But before it is placed in front of the parabolic reflector , we have to get the damned drum out of the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum will be excited to vibration . " I began to chuckle . " Then you ca n't use the damned thing ? " Duckworth nodded . " For the foreseeable future , " he admitted . We walked on to another huge hangar . The guards here were carrying submachine guns and they leveled them at me as we approached . I slipped behind Duckworth and he produced a pass . They muttered unhappily but let us through . " You know , " I said to Duckworth , " I could n't even get clearance to enter a post office . " He ignored my words and pointed to what seemed to be a multistage space vehicle inside . " A space platform , " said Duckworth . " Would you like to know what it 's for ? " " Are you allowed to tell me ? " " My plan , " said Duckworth , " is to mount a huge lens on this platform . The focal length will be three hundred miles . " " Do n't tell me , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same distance over the enemy 's jungle hideouts . " " Precisely , " said Duckworth . " An electronically controlled shutter , triggered by telemetered signal , will enable us to focus the sun 's rays on any desired site . Instant conflagration will follow . " " Perfectly hideous , " I said . " But it may work . " " Not really , " said Duckworth.  | " ' Why not ? " " Because the enemy has prepared an enormous mobile reflecting mirror which , if properly placed , would burn up our space platform . " " What a pity , " I said sarcastically . Duckworth 's shoulders drooped . " Have you anything else to show me ? " I asked . He pulled at his lower lip . " Not hardware , " he said . " But I have a new strategic concept . " I was blunt . " I do n't quite see you in that role , " I said . Duckworth stiffened . " Then hear this , " he said . He looked about to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of entropy ? " he asked . " Entropy , " I said didactically , " is a measure of the disorder in a physical system . A decrease in entropy means an increase in order . " " A plus , " said Duckworth . " As you well know , the total entropy of a system can never decrease . Conversely , the total order can never increase . More order in one spot means less elsewhere . " " So ? " " We in the United States , " said Duckworth , " have built a highly efficient , beautifully organized community . We have increased order in our own land to an enormous degree . But by the law of entropy , this increase in order must be offset elsewhere by a similar decrease in order . " " - Vould this explain our troubles in Vietnam ? " I asked . " It would . To end that war , one would have to generate some disorder at home . " " And disorder will diminish abroad . Since it wo n't happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | We walked on in silence . Overhead the sun had begun to set and the vast cloud banks were delicately tinted with roseate streaks . " Come home , " I said . " Your strength lies in pure research , not in destruction . " He shook his head . " Not until I 've finished my stint here . " All at once I caught on . " Of course , " I said . " It 's your theory of stupid things being right at the proper time and place . But it wo n't work . And some might call it treason . " " Would you ? " I grasped his hand and shook it warmly . " Is there anything I can do to help ? " " Just defend my good name when someone attacks me on Campus . " Back on Campus , I plunged into the daily routine of harassing students who did n't enter their names in the computer log book . And then a shocking thing occurred . Campus eruptions broke out all over the country . Blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruptive strikes . Shortly thereafter , peace talks began in Paris . And hard upon , Duckworth returned to Campus . I tried to be discreet and avoid mentioning his last project . But one night , after three stiff shots of Jack Daniels , my tongue loosened . " That last one bring you home ? " Duckworth speared the olive out of his Martini and popped it into his mouth . He chewed it with great relish . " You 're quite right , " he said , after he 'd ejected the pit . " I came back when my last scheme succeeded . " " But you did n't do anything to make it happen , did you ? "  | " Of course not , " he said . " That 's why I became so frightened . " " Frightened ? " " Look at it this way , " he said . " For the first time in the history of mankind , the world has within its grasp the chance for a durable peace , a peace without foreseeable end . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America with her capacity for unlimited , unending domestic violence and disorder , and the unique knowhow to carry it out . " " Do n't worry , Duckworth , " I said . " The world can count on us , we 'll never let them down . " And glasses held high , we drank to that universal dream , again and again .  | IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN sooner or later . In an age of intense specialization , one branch of Science was unable to understand what any other was doing . Emmett Duckworth , eminent biochemist , recalls how the idea popped into his head . " I suppose it was those rat experiments , " he said , looking up from his bunsen burner . " Some chap had trained rats to run a maze . Then he fed some of their cortex , chopped fine , to untrained rats . These rats learned to run mazes much faster than the originals had . " " I decided to repeat this experiment and go one step further . But this time , after feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new rats . To my amazement , they ran the maze anyway . It meant that a total memory transfer had taken place . All at once , everything fell into place . If we could snip a bit of cortex from an Einstein , a Pauling , a Bertrand Russell , then feed it to a youngster , we would start him off with every single thing his donors knew . The rest is history . "  | And so it was . IQ Soup , as the wags called it , was fed to preselected youngsters and , overnight , each one absorbed the total knowledge of the donor . The next step was to choose the likeliest of the youngsters and feed him a composite compote taken from each of his companions , giving him a kind of super memory . This lad then took the next step , which was to feed on tissue taken from his own cortex . The world now had on its hands the purest distillation of knowledge ever known . This super genius belonged to no one and to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decided that a world tour was in order and he journeyed and gave audiences in Australia , China , the Soviet Union , Europe , and Africa . On the way home , his plane developed engine trouble but an astute pilot gently eased it down into a dense forest of Brazil . There , he was rescued , washed , and eaten by the chief of a small but hardy tribe of cannibals.  | I ENTERED THE GREAT MEETING HALL of the Directorate with many misgivings as to why this emergency session had been called . Ezio Wattari was there , his bald head gleaming under the combined illumination of the concealed panel lighting . Wattari , the fifth Secretary of the Solar System Directorate , was a vigorous , extroverted man who commanded little love from his colleagues but a good deal of respect . He was a decision maker , able to sift important facts from the unimportant chaff . That was his chief virtue . But his reasoning was too simplistic , failing to take into account the many subtleties and nuances of intergalactic politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fixed itself in his mind , it could not be shaken loose . I felt in my bones that the meeting must concern itself with the Sentient problem and I was right . Within a few moments , the Directorate had been called to order and the agenda laid bare for all to see . Brenner , head of Psychiatric Services , suppressed a smile as Wattari outlined his version of the Sentient problem . I was infuri-  | ated because Brenner was as guilty as we were in knuckling under to Wattari 's dictatorial suggestions . " We 're in a life and death struggle with the Sentient culture , " said Wattari emphatically but with little passion in his voice . " They outnumber us in population by ten to one , and in first rank scientists , by about twenty to one . If you add to this the tremendous natural resources of Planet Gamma , the picture is dismaying . " Dismaying ? There was no one who dared raise an objection to the one-sided analysis . The Sentients occupied one of the three inhabitable planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed markedly from the Solarites in appearance , language , and customs , but were talented , versed in music , literature , and the graphic arts . They were honest in their commercial dealing and forthright in keeping their treaty obligations . But they were also enormously productive and extremely ingenious in making low-cost finished goods which we could n't compete with in price . In the middle of the twenty-first century , radio astronomical contacts had been made and several formal visits of state were exchanged . But further exchanges were impossible now that our intragalactic trade had fallen to almost nothing . There were many hostile reactions to the Sentients throughout the solar system and Wattari had been elected on the promise of breaking contact with the Sentients and outdoing them economically . He had even hinted at developing new weapons , a suggestion that sent shudders through all of us who had read of the long-past Fission Wars . " I 've enlisted our greatest scientist , Dr. Andrew Cook , " said Wattari . " Under his direction , his student Dr. Anatole Duval has produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . " He nodded toward a short , plump man on his left who was glancing through typed sheets of paper . 1  | " I wo n't attempt to describe the function of this device , " said Wattari . " I 'll leave that to Dr. Duval . But when he has finished his exposition , we 'll continue in closed session . " Duval was not a good speaker . He was burdened by a speech impediment that thickened his s 's . He seemed upset by the importance of his discovery and by certain unresolved questions which had been raised by his conscience . " With Dr. Cook 's help , " said Duval , " I have designed an instrument which can duplicate any object in the solar system . We had hoped to use it to duplicate tools and manufactured goods very economically . Unfortunately , the energy demands of the unit are so enormous that the cost of duplication exceeds that of the normal method . " " There is another difficulty , " he added . " Results are predictable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not anticipate a complete atom by atom duplication . I 've utilized a sampling approach which examines the object to be duplicated by a pseudo-random scan . Consequently , we can expect perfect duplication only fifty percent of the time . " " If Dr. Duval will forgive my interruption , " said Wattari , " his Duplicator does excellent work . I have seen samples of its output . " " Can it duplicate weapons ? " asked Czesni softly . Czesni was a plump , ruddy-cheeked man , whose dour disposition belied his cheerful appearance . He was also head of Solar Counter Intelligence . Duval stiffened . " I made it clear to Secretary Wattari that Dr. Cook and I would not permit this device to be utilized for weapons duplication . " " I gave him that assurance , " said Wattari hurriedly . " Subject of course to the flow of events . "  | " Can it duplicate Life ? " I asked , feeling that my question was probably ridiculous in the extreme . Duval stared at me without replying for some seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are risks inherent in such duplications . Since the statistical expectation does not fulfill itself in each case , all sorts of terrible aberrations might follow . It would be very dangerous to duplicate a small mammal , for example . " Duval went on to display several objects which he had duplicated with his machine . They were passed about from hand to hand , and I must confess that I had strong doubts that any of them were duplications . I looked about the room and it seemed that most faces were skeptical . But no one had the courage to air his doubts . The objects were returned to Duval and he placed them in a small carrying bag and left the room . At this point Wattari declared the Directorate was in Plenary Session , invoking the tightest security regulations . I hoped that Wattari 's plans did not involve Duval 's harebrained machine but they did . " Did it ever occur to any of you , " said Wattari , focusing his eyes on me , " what it would mean if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The days when a Galileo could contribute to different branches of Science are all long past . Dr. Cook specializes in particle physics , but what if he were able to devote all of his time to fuel problems , or communication problems ? " There was a stir throughout the room . We knew what Wattari was alluding to , but it was impossible to believe that he was serious . I stole a look at Brenner and I saw that he had gone pale . " In short , " said Wattari , " I propose to use Duval 's Duplicator to produce one hundred Andrew Cooks . The number itself is arbitrary . Our mathematicians tell me  | that we can expect perhaps fifty of these men to be as productive as Cook himself . And at one stroke , we 'd raise our creative potential manyfold . " Brenner could not contain himself . " If it could be done , it would still be a risky business , " he said . " I doubt if we could convince Dr. Cook . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it seems to me that none of the Cooks must know about the others . How could we manage that problem ? " " It can be done , " said Czesni . " This type of security problem is well within our capability . We would send each Cook to a different region of the solar system , operating under the tightest security regulations , regulations that forbid communication with other regions . " " But , " said Brenner , " we 'd also have to duplicate his wife and children . Are you ready to duplicate them one hundred times ? " " Why not ? " said Wattari . " The stakes are high . If we do n't move quickly , the chance may be gone . And which of us wants to end up as Sentients , stripped of our heritage , our individuality , our goods . Bizarre and risky as it seems , we have to try the duplications . " I wanted to object , but I was afraid . My criticism would have invoked morals and ethics and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Information was already on shaky ground , and it would be pointless to jeopardize it without any chance of succeeding . I voted " aye " along with all of the others and joined in the four-man subcommittee which was to determine how the duplications were to be carried out . Czesni expressed his doubts about Cook . " I do n't trust Cook 's loyalty , " he said . " Nothing concrete , you understand , just a feeling that he ca n't be counted on when the chips are down . Why not duplicate Edward Molloy instead ? "  | " Because although Molloy is good , he 's not in Cook 's class , " said Wattari drily . Brenner and I both nodded agreement . " I suggest , " said Brenner , " that we proceed as follows . " He outlined a plan of action and then proceeded to full detail that indicated a good deal of prior thought . " What a swine he is , " I thought . But there was nothing to do but acquiesce . Brenner 's proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only member of the Directorate who was a personal friend of Andrew Cook , I had to carry out the first step of the plan . I went at once to Twin Acres , a lovely triple-tiered aluminum house near the Cook Particle Research Center . I was embarrassed by the warm hospitality lavished upon me by Emily Cook , an outgoing woman of forty , lovely in feature and contour , who treated me with the special regard of an old friend . I fought off the guilt feelings that plagued me through the day , particularly when the four Cook children came in to join us . The three girls and one boy ranged in age from four to fourteen and they reflected the warmth of their mother and the quiet self-assurance of their father . Andrew Cook joined us in the evening , and although he usually showed little emotion , it was clear that he was pleased to see me . We chatted about his work and his current idea to reduce all particles down to a basic few . He joked about Duval 's Duplicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the heavenly aroma of an old-fashioned roast prepared by Emily Cook in a duplicate of a twentieth-century gas oven which Cook had built with his own hands . There had been a renaissance of interest in non-automated devices of the past  | and the Cooks had busied themselves restoring some of these relics . I found their efforts a charming eccentricity but not my cup of tea . Nevertheless , there was a personalized quality to the meal that gave me a great sense of ease . Afterward , we skipped the marvels of tactile entertainment provided by the Solar Recreation Network and just talked . It was a rare evening for me . But in the morning , I could not escape reality . I informed Andrew Cook of his new assignment , as yet undefined , at a new location , as yet unspecified . He and his family were to report for a complete physical checkup and receive space travel injections . He looked at me quizzically . " Of course you wo n't tell me why ? " he said . " Can you guess ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant enough to see through the transparent plot . " It has to do with the silly hullabaloo about the Sentients , " he said , unsmiling . " But more than that I would n't care to say . " " In a way it does , " I replied . " It 's an attempt to increase our productivity in areas that will benefit our economy . Indirectly , it will of course improve our status vis-a-vis the Sentients . " " Competition , " said Emily Cook angrily . " It 's a word I detest . " I sighed and accepted the aperitif that Cook offered me and after drinking it and glowing within from an epicenter of warmth , I handed him the instructions he and his family were to follow . The entire affair went off smoothly . Cook , his wife and family , were drugged briefly and then duplicated , one hundred times each . Duval was sick with guilt but he had been convinced by the argument that it was his patriotic duty . Afterward , he turned to me and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one  | hundred men of such brilliance and nobility as Andrew Cook ? " Although I detested Czesni , I had to admit that he carried off his job with dispatch . There was no hint of what had taken place in the news media , nor were there rumors floating about . Only members of the Directorate participated in shepherding the different Cooks to their many destinations and Czesni 's transportation scheme worked without a hitch . Andrew Cook ( the original ) and his family were of course restored to Twin Acres . I informed them that it had been decided , after all , to allow him to continue his particle work , undisturbed for the time being . Emily and the children were delighted , but Cook showed great uneasiness . " What 's been going on ? " he said to me , just before I left Twin Acres . " Really nothing , " I said hastily , trying to seem casual and forthright . " Just the usual administrative foul-up . Someone makes a hasty decision and then days later , after deeper consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . " " I 'd like to believe it happened that way , " said Cook and I shook his hand and left . As the months went by , Wattari seemed more and more pleased with his plan . Each of the Cooks had taken his new assignment and enormous progress was reported on diverse fronts . But Brenner , our psychiatric expert , had become increasingly morose . I buttonholed him one day , after a Directorate session filled with glowing reports . " I might as well tell you , " said Brenner . " My worst fears are being realized . " " What 's going on ? " I said , my dormant guilt feelings flaring up again .  | " There are difficulties that involve the new Cooks . " " What difficulties ? " I asked . Brenner sighed . " I 'm preparing an exploratory trip to find out precisely what 's going wrong . Do you think you could convince Wattari that you ought to go along ? " My feelings were mixed . On the one hand , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet on the other hand , I had to know . Brenner and I left the following day by Space Transport under sealed orders . Our visits to the different Cook families had a sense of unreality which I find it difficult to convey . Brenner was completely occupied with administering psychiatric tests under the guise of finding out how the families were acclimating to artificial atmospheres , but I spent most of my time speaking to these people on a social level . ( Andrew Cook ) 35 was almost indistinguishable from the original Andrew Cook , and yet in certain subtle ways which I could not define , he was different . The relations between each Cook and his wife and children were not always as I had recalled them to be . For example , ( Andrew Cook ) b3 's personality was so strikingly different that he seemed to be another man . He was profoundly depressed , withdrawn , and I could not engage him in conversation . ( Emily ) S3 spoke to me at great length over the changes that had taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this man , " she cried , close to tears . " He 's not my husband as I 've always known him . " I assured her that he was , but later , I got hold of Brenner and pressured him into telling me something about his officially secret psychiatric tests . " The mathematicians will be pleased to know , " said Brenner , " that forty-eight of these Cooks are like peas  | in a pod . Many of their responses to Rorschach blots are identical , word for word . The others go through a diverse scatter of characteristics and , of course , number eighty-three is dangerously depressed . I ought to recommend hospitalization for him but how could we keep it a secret ? I really do n't know what to do about him . " " How about the wives and children ? " I asked . Brenner flushed . " That 's the worst aspect of this unhappy affair . Although fifty-two percent of the wives are almost identical with the original Emily Cook , the other forty-eight percent also range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . As you know , we never attempted to match children , wives , and Andrew Cooks as closely as we could have . The result shows up in terrible stress within the families . Some of the Cook children have the feeling that their parents are not their real parents . This is a fantasy which all children have , you know . But the horrible thing is that in this case it is real . Some of the wives have doubts about their husbands and some of the husbands about their wives . Their sexual desires , their needs and attitudes , have been altered , usually subtly but always noticeably , and these things taken in concert with everything else have jarred these families off center . Need I tell you more ? " I became spacesick , although never before had I been upset by space travel . Brenner aided me through my difficult days with suitably administered tranquilizers which he prescribed in equal quantity and frequency for himself . Brenner 's report was delivered to the Directorate and nothing was done about it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer other than to reveal to all the Cooks what had happened . Publicity  | would have ruined us all , since what we had done , however patriotically intentioned , was a clear violation of the Solar Constitution , so Brenner 's halfhearted suggestion was quickly turned down . Even so , all might have worked out well , but for an unexpected move by the Sentients . Alarmed by the hostile and belligerent editorials in the solar press which attacked the Sentients almost daily , the Sentient Government published a manifesto offering us complete collaboration on all scientific and commercial endeavors . Collaboration was to be preceded by cultural interchanges on every level so that the peoples of both regions could learn first hand about each other . The Directorate had to counter quickly . In a carefully written statement ( which I wrote ) , Wattari declared that the Sentients were trying to divide and weaken us from within . " Such collaboration , if accepted , would obliterate all the uniqueness and color of our own culture . We would be made helpless by the numbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But despite our counterpublicity , the Sentient campaign began to bear fruit . Here and there , dissident influences , swayed by the siren song of the Sentients , began to agitate for acceptance or at least negotiation of the Sentient proposal . Czesni became active in ferreting out some of these potential enemies but even he was caught completely unawares when a petition burst upon us , signed by thirty outstanding solar system scientists , and the list was headed by the signature of Andrew Cook . I went at once to see the original Cook and showed him the petition . He was completely taken aback , primarily because he felt that some of the phrases in the petition could have been written by him . I realized , then , the error of what I had done .  | " It 's just a clever parroting of your writing style , " I said hastily . " You know , " said Cook , " I agree with this petition . I could have written part of it myself . " " But you did n't ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " I said lamely . " It 's just a cheap forgery . " " My signature was forged to perfection , " said Cook wryly . Czesni was determined to find out which Cook had signed the petition . " Since , " said Brenner , " only one Cook is involved , it ca n't be a normal ' Cook . It must be one of the aberrations . " " But the real Cook said he could have written it , " I noted . " Could have but did n't , " said Brenner . " Even the aberrants are not that different from the original . But this Cook was different enough so that he took action where the others might only have thought about doing something . " SCI agents were dispatched to one hundred locations and a discreet but intensive questioning of one hundred Andrew Cooks was initiated . Only ( Cook ) , the depressed Cook , responded badly to the questioning and in his case , it was suspended after only seven hours . I was awakened one night shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dr. Duval . His speech impediment had become so exaggerated that I could n't tell what he was saying . I impressed on him that he had to calm down and speak lucidly and slowly . After a visibly strong effort , he succeeded in telling me what had happened . " I received a call ten minutes ago from Mrs. Cook ,  | the eighty-third Mrs. Cook , " said Duval , spacing his words slowly . " Her husband has killed himself . " I was too shocked to even murmur the usual phrase of condolence . I just gulped and attempted to get my vocal chords working . " You must n't let this throw you , " I said at last . " The eighty-third Cook was so different from all of the others that something like this was bound to happen . " " It was my fault , " said Duval , keening . " I let you talk me into creating other Andrew Cooks and now I have destroyed him . It must never happen again . " Before I could answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what had happened . He snorted in anger . " I warned Czesni but he ignored me , " he said bitterly . " And now we 're faced with this suicide . How will we ever keep the others from finding out ? " I immediately called Czesni and he informed me , with great emotion , that Duval , that great idiot , had smashed the Duplicating Machine and destroyed all of the drawings . The guards whom Czesni had assigned to prevent this very occurrence were careless , and had arrived too late to stop Duval . It was clear to all of us that our great task , at this juncture , was to keep the other Cooks from finding out what had happened . And we succeeded , apparently . What Czesni did to the eighty-third Mrs. Cook and her family , I did not know , nor did I inquire . Brenner and I both averted our eyes whenever we met . Duval had disappeared after a rapid , unpublicized trial for destroying classified solar property . As for Wattari , he still exuded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next announcement of the Sentients destroyed the facade we had been erecting . Their Intragalactic  | Science Prize , they declared , had been awarded to Andrew Cook . But to which Andrew Cook ? And what if each one of them decided to accept it ? " There 's no question about it , " said Wattari at the emergency Directorate meeting . " It would be an act of high treason to accept this prize . Every single one of the Cooks must be warned of our feelings on this matter . " " If you will permit me , " said Brenner . " I think such an approach would produce the countereffect . You would inevitably force each Cook to rebel and then the whole story would come out . I suggest a more cautious plan . Let me visit the original Andrew Cook and tell him exactly what has taken place . We can then judge from his reaction what the others might do . Perhaps his better judgment will induce him to cooperate with us . " " I 'll go along with Brenner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am present at this meeting . " " I want to be there , too , " I said grimly . " After all , Cook and I are very close friends . " The meeting with Andrew Cook went very quietly at first . Brenner was carefully feeling his way along . And when he broke the story about the duplication , I held my breath . Cook looked at him , unblinkingly , his eyes smoldering . " I knew about the duplications , " he said and the left side of Brenner 's cheek began to twitch violently . " I was always aware that something had occurred when I was anesthetized but I could n't be sure what it was . Of course , having directed Duval 's duplicator work , I conjectured about that , too . The petition incident all but gave me the clinching evidence and then Duval told me about the death of the eighty-third Andrew Cook . " " Then he called you , too ? " I interjected . " Through a lapse in censorship control , he did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've contacted each of the other Cooks and apprised them of what has happened . " " How did you manage that ? " asked Czesni angrily . " There was a lapse on the night of the suicide , but only that one time . All of your mail , intragalactic wireless , and every one of your published papers have been meticulously monitored . " Andrew Cook smiled for the first time that afternoon . " I wo n't be naive enough to tell you everything , " he said . " But I 'll tell you this much . I deliberately wrote a tutorial paper on particles which was submitted to the Solar Journal of Theoretical Physics . Your agency cleared that paper with the proviso that a pseudonym be used . " " I know that , " said Czesni sullenly . " I used an approach , pet phrases , and personal allusions that only I could have known about . I injected minor paradoxes of the sort I particularly love . Suffice it to say , I sufficiently piqued the curiosity of forty-six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally simple but ingenious code I invented in my childhood . We have also banded into a unified group of Andrew Cooks and we intend , very shortly , to release to the entire solar system , the full story of the crime you perpetrated on me and my family . " " We 're not total fools , " said Czesni . " We anticipated the possibility of what you 've done and arranged for countermeasures . " He went to the door and signaled a group of SCI agents into the house . " I am ordering the immediate arrest of every single Cook and his family . Each one will be brought to SCI headquarters and kept there , pending disposition of this matter . "  | Brenner and I looked at each other in dismay . " You ca n't pull this highhanded business on your own , " said Brenner . " A decision of this magnitude can only be made by the entire Directorate . " " I 'm acting under personal orders from Wattari , " said Czesni drily . " You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started out , Cook took hold of my arm . I could n't turn and face him . " I suppose you despise me , " I muttered . " I helped split you into a hundred parts . " " I 've come to some sort of terms with my dispersal , " said Cook . " I 'm not happy about it , but I can live with it . Duval , of course , saw me as some kind of demi-god instead of the fallible , imperfect human being that I am . He could n't know how many times I 've failed as a father , and as a husband . " " Not as much as I 've failed in the role of human being , " I thought . And then I left . For me , it was the wildest aspect of the entire Cook affair . I walked through the enormous barred detention hall and looked at the many , many Cooks . It was as if I were in a Hall of Mirrors . They were , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not talking to any of them , just counting heads to make sure that everyone was there . When I came outside , I found Czesni , relaxed , smiling with a self-assurance I no longer had . " This business has really gotten you down , " said Czesni . " You look positively ashen . " " I 'm ill , " I said . " And I 'm resigning from the Directorate as of this very minute . " Czesni 's eyebrows elevated . " Are n't you reacting excessively ? " he asked , reaching over and patting my shoulder in a brotherly manner .  | " We do n't intend to harm the Cooks if they behave . We 're simply going to relocate them at one inaccessible spot until this situation blows over . " " What about the Science Prize ? " " We 're even willing to let one of the Cooks appear to accept it , " said Czesni . " Of course he must pledge to remain silent about the duplications . You see that I 'm not a barbarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of self-delusion , " I said . I was very tired and anxious to start on my journey . " Self-delusion ? What self-delusion ? " asked Czesni . " Did you include the original Andrew Cook in this group of detained people ? " I asked , ignoring his question . " Of course , " said Czesni . " There are one hundred Cooks in there , plus one hundred and one wives and families . " " There are one hundred and one Andrew Cooks in that room , " I said . " I counted them five times just to be sure . Cook has played his own little joke on you . " " Joke ? What the hell are you talking about ? " cried Czesni in sudden panic . Brenner , who had been standing nearby , listening to the interchange , came closer and fixed Czesni with his tormented eyes . " Are you an utter fool ? " he said . " Cook has sent us one extra Cook . He has built God knows how many duplicators , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are finished , all of us . And he buried his face in his hands . I did not wait to see if Czesni joined him .  | DUCKWORTH AND I first met Ying Chang Wei in the lobby of the Hotel Metropol in Moscow . We were all attending the International Meeting in Computerized Biochemistry and each of us wore the blue enameled badge that marked out all visitors . Ying spoke an almost perfect English with a touch of Brooklynese and at first I thought he was an American . " Oh no , " he said , suppressing a chuckle . " I did my graduate work at Columbia . But now I live in Kunming and teach at the State University . " The three of us went to the sessions together , walked through Red Square with linked arms , and visited all of the obligatory sights including Lenin 's tomb . I was afraid , at first , that he would begin to spout an antiAmerican line , but he kept off politics for the most part . And he had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking and he had taken away a few nasty ones from America . I became aware of this fact when he induced Duckworth to sniff at a rose in his lapel and promptly sprayed him with vodka . But Duckworth took it good-humoredly.  | " I see , " said Ying one morning after breakfast , " that you guys are giving a joint paper on some item involving roaches . " He wrinkled his flat nose and shook his head in mock horror . " It 's a hormonal distillate that I discovered last year , " said Duckworth . " It plays a part in mating and the smallest concentration drives female roaches into a frenzy of passion . My chum here wrote the computer programs that helped me work out the chemical structure . " I did n't mention the fact that Duckworth and I had contracted with a prominent exterminator to allow the distillate to be used to trap roaches . It meant a walloping piece of cash for us , enough to make us both independent of granting agencies and heads of Chemistry and Computer departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , dimly lit cafe off Gorky Street , where the aroma of sour cabbage seemed to seep into every crack in the room . I was nursing a single glass , but Duckworth had been fooled by the velvety feel of the vodka and was on the verge of being stoned . Ying was well potted , too . He began to complain about the difficulties he 'd had with his emancipated girl friend . " For a time , " he said thickly , " I even thought of slipping an aphrodisiac into her drinks . " " An intriguing idea , " said Duckworth amiably , " but I have a much better way . " Ying smiled patronizingly . " Sure , sure , " he said . Duckworth waggled his head sagely at the Chinese skeptic . " After I found the sex lure for female roaches , I wondered if a counterpart existed for humans . " " I doubt it , " said Ying . " Where 's the waiter ? " I said , trying to steer Duck-  | worth away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time being . " You 're absolutely wrong , " said Duckworth , ignoring my under-the-table kick . " Not only does a similar hormone exist , but I have a small quantity of it in my room at the Metropol . " Ying seemed to slide right out of his alcoholic haze . " How does it work ? " he asked . " I 've only tried it once , " said Duckworth , chuckling happily at the recollection . " But if sprayed on any male , however homely , it will draw women like a flame lures moths . " " Where do you get this hormone ? " " The uric acid of celibate men , " I interjected and I glared at Duckworth meaningfully . Ying yawned and shrugged his shoulders . " You guys are pulling my leg , " he said . " There 's no such hormone . " " Maybe there is and maybe there is n't , wise guy , " I said dourly . " Duckworth has said too much already . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ca n't believe it really works . " I made one last desperate attempt to change the subject to acupuncture , the science of healing by needles which is still practiced in modern China . But Ying would n't be swayed . Again and again he referred to Duckworth 's new hormone , taunting him and deriding him as a bluffer . " All right , " said Duckworth at last , provoked into foolhardiness . " But this stuff is powerful beyond belief . I 'll just use a tiny fraction of a cc . " We went back to the hotel and I helped Duckworth insert the key into his suitcase . He rummaged through the bottom until he found the blue sock in which he had hidden a vial . He withdrew it from the toe of the sock ,  | then removed a minute portion from the vial with a pipette . Ying was watching intently . " I 'll now place the contents on my friend 's left ear lobe , " announced Duckworth with the air of a stage magician . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught hold of me and before I could get away , the deed was done . Ying began to sniff the air vigorously . " I do n't smell a damned thing , " he said . Duckworth seemed annoyed . " You ca n't smell it consciously , " he said . " Women become aware of it through its effects . After all , infrared light is n't visible to the human eye but the burns produced are real enough . " " Maybe , " said Ying . He was clearly still skeptical . " Let 's go down to the lobby , " said Duckworth taking me by the arm and dragging me along . In the hallway , the chambermaid , a middle-aged peasant woman , was staggering along under a heavy load of linen . As I passed her , she quivered and swiveled her head rapidly in my direction . I walked quickly by , pretending not to notice her agitation . The sound of a heavy thud stopped me in my tracks and as I turned back , I saw that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wild look of passion on her ruddy face . Duckworth shoved Ying in front of me and pressed the elevator button feverishly . Ying addressed her in his best Russian , trying to shame her into going back but she would n't budge . She rode down in the elevator , caressing my receding locks and whispering soft love phrases between bites of my ear lobe . The ride lasted no more than forty-five seconds but in that short time I suffered through three passionate embraces that almost cracked my ribs . Emerging into the lobby was like going from the fry-  | ing pan into the fire . Within seconds I was surrounded by a heaving , sobbing cluster of women , some young , some old , some comely , and some homely as sin . All were buxom and clutched at me , kissed me , tearing at my clothing . Somehow ( I vaguely recall Ying flailing away with Judo chops ) , Duckworth pulled me to safety and got me back to our room . After I had washed the deadly stuff off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm vigorously . " You 're a genius , " he said softly and there were tears in those normally inscrutable eyes . " I 'd never have believed it possible . " I was thoroughly exhausted and Duckworth was feeling dizzy so Ying very kindly helped us into our respective beds . He insisted on staying until I fell asleep and I was touched by his thoughtfulness . Just before my eyes closed , I heard him say softly , " What an exquisite way to go . " The following morning , nothing was said about the hormone , each of us pretending that nothing had happened the night before . Duckworth presented our joint paper at the meeting two days later and the reaction was very gratifying . Afterward , he was surrounded by dozens of scientists , all enthusiastic about his discovery of the sexual lure of insects . But nobody suspected that Duckworth had carried the work into the realm of human beings . On the last day of the conference , we were all invited to a great ball to be given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited but Ying seemed bored at the prospect . " In my country , " he said , lapsing for the first time into a political comment , " the Soviet Chairman is a neorevisionist and a menace to the World Revolution . "  | " I do n't know , " said Duckworth . " I kind of like the old boy . He seems to be looking for peaceful solutions . " " That 's what you think , " said Ying bitterly and there the matter rested . The reception was dazzling . The profusion of caviar , herrings , smoked salmon , and sturgeon , and the generous pouring of vodka and champagne , made the affair a huge success . And then Ying decided to approach the Party Chairman and tell him what a great party he was throwing . " I 'm disappointed in Ying , " said Duckworth . " I did n't think he was a hypocrite . " I clutched at Duckworth 's arm in horror . " Look , " I said , " he 's asking the Chairman to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pudgy frame of the Party Chairman inclined slightly forward , a forceful spray issued from the rose . Even Duckworth was stunned . " I never thought Ying would pull a practical joke at this gathering , " he muttered . I closed my eyes , too cowardly to watch , but when I opened them I saw that the Chairman had responded by laughing heartily and was accepting the episode with good humor . He clapped Ying on the back and sent him on his way , wagging his finger at him as if to indicate , " Naughty , naughty . " And then the hordes of women descended on the Party Chairman . He was inundated , battered , swamped , and finally borne under . The security guards who hovered everywhere had the devil 's own time breaking through the screaming , frantic women and it took a full fifteen minutes to pull them off the Chairman . He climbed to his feet , dazed and bleeding profusely from the forehead , and was immediately guided from the room by a flying phalanx of the security guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to our room at once , " he said . We made our apologies and headed swiftly back to the hotel . Duckworth went at once to the toe of his blue sock . The vial was gone ! Duckworth was shocked beyond belief and furious at the double dealing of Ying . Above all , we could n't puzzle out the motive behind this schoolboyish trick . We never saw Ying again . I questioned the desk clerk , but either my Russian was inadequate , or else the man was being closemouthed . I could get no information on Ying 's whereabouts . Upon our return to America , it took us a good ten days to settle down . While I was poring over the backlog of program requests on my desk , Duckworth came in with the afternoon newspaper and pointed at the headline . There , in banner letters , was a statement of the downfall of the Soviet Party Chairman . The Western world was completely taken by surprise . That evening , as Duckworth and I sidled into the unappetizing corridor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who identified himself as a representative of the State Department . To my delight , he suggested a confidential discussion at some out-of-theway gourmet haven , all on a Government expense account . After the first round of drinks , he announced that he had come to us for rather special information . " If it 's about the Party Chairman , " said Duckworth , " we ca n't tell you much . We saw him once , and then , only from a distance . " He looked at Duckworth , taken aback . " As a matter of fact , " he said , " it is about the Party Chairman . It 's our understanding that in Moscow , you two spent considerable time with a Ying Chang Wei . All of our file information indicates that Mr. Ying was a  | very clever agent of Chinese Intelligence . What did you talk to him about ? " " Computers and chemistry , mostly , " said Duckworth truthfully . " And about love and his emancipated girl friend . " " No politics ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought there might be some link between Ying and the Chairman 's downfall . But I ca n't make the connection . " " Do you know why the Chairman was deposed ? " asked Duckworth . Our visitor grinned . " I suppose there 's no reason why I ca n't tell you although I do n't think you 'll believe me . Every Government setup has its stresses and strains and the Soviets are no exception . But when the wives of prominent Politbureau members are found in the bedroom of the Chairman 's dacha and brazenly refuse to leave , political ties tend to blow apart . " " That 's too far fetched , " said Duckworth . " I do n't believe a word of it . More likely it was some diabolical plot . " " Maybe , " said our visitor . We had another round of drinks and he regaled us with some salty anecdotes about the peccadillos of our own Congressmen , before he left . " By the way , " said Duckworth , as we all stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ying disappeared before we left Moscow . Do you know what happened to him ? " Our visitor seemed surprised . " Did n't they tell you ? He was found in the street , the night of the reception , mauled to death . The Chinese Government is claiming that the brutal beating was carried out by the Russian secret police . "  | Duckworth and I glanced at each other and I saw in his eyes that he understood , too . It was the artificial rose in Ying 's lapel that had been his undoing . As we shook hands with the departing visitor , I wondered if Ying could have chosen a better way to die .  | I HAD RARELY SEEN Duckworth in so ebullient a mood . His tiny eyes sparkled , his normally pale cheeks were aglow with color , and his wispy beard fluttered like a royal pennant . " You 've won the State lottery ! " I cried . He shook his head . His Federal research grants had been sharply slashed and he had taken to pasting lottery tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " It 's not that at all , " growled Duckworth . " I 've come up with a new idea and it has exciting possibilities . " He drew up a rickety laboratory stool and gingerly lowered his rump as he began to sketch out penciled squares on a lined yellow pad . " I ca n't make it out , " I said , staring at the irregular lines . " All a matter of recordings , " said Duckworth . " To take a simple example , consider sound . We 've captured the analogue of sound waves on disks , then on wire , and currently on magnetic tape . "  | I nodded my head . " And in the case of light , " I said , " we 've recorded on glass plates , then film , and now on photochromic materials . " " That 's the point , " said Duckworth . " And by use of the hologram , we can lock up interference patterns into a tiny space , which can be used to reconstitute a threedimensional image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes care of sound and light , " I said . There 's still taste , touch , and smell . " Duckworth leaned forward in a conspiratorial manner . " And feeling , " he added . " Feeling ? " " The full emotional impact of an event , once experienced , just as it happened to you , " said Duckworth . " Just imagine what it would be like to relive an exquisite , once-in-a-lifetime experience , and savor once again all of its joys . It would mean that one could transform the life of every invalid , every old man , every middleaged couple that 's lost the freshness of the honeymoon era . " " You 're an incurable romantic , " I said . " But I get your point . The great part of living is made up of tedium , trials and tribulations . The high spots are quite rare . " " But they do n't have to be , " said Duckworth . " I have worked out a way of locking them up , ready to be recaptured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My jaw dropped . " If you have , " I said , " then you 've outdone yourself . It sounds utterly impossible to me . " " So would holography a hundred years ago , " said Duckworth . He rose from his stool suddenly , and it clattered backward to the laboratory floor .  | " Come along , " he said , " and I 'll show you what I mean . " He dashed off down the corridor to his Animal room , unbuttoned lab coat fluttering around him . I followed after , warily . I had many a bump and bruise to show from test tube stands and dismantled fraction collectors that were set about in unlikely places . Duckworth flipped on the main light switch and pointed exultantly at six small cages set on a table in the middle of the room . Each one held a single white rat . Then he stroked his beard reflectively . " I suppose I ought to give you some preliminary information , " he muttered to himself . " Please . " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The internal effects of a real-life experience on a sentient being must affect all of the senses . Somewhere in the nervous system is a terminal cell or set of cells for each peripheral receptor . The pathways may not be easy to find . But in these terminal cells , every split second of experience is electrochemically recorded and stored sequentially . We can all , by means of a crude memory recall , relive very approximately some past experience . The reason for the roughness of the recall is because the record of the experience is cluttered over by the interfering effects of innumerable previous experiences and the hash of succeeding events . Besides , even without interference , there would be some degeneration in the record as time went by . " " I can accept your hypothesis , " I said . " But how can you possibly retrieve the information of these records , particularly in the correct sequence ? " Duckworth 's eyes began to gleam again . " First I freeze the records , " he said . " In that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I retrieve every bit of data in proper sequence . "  | I threw up my hands . " How ? " I asked in exasperation . " By combining old and new techniques , " said Duckworth . " For many years , we 've been able to map cortical areas in mammalian brains which correspond to various sensory inputs . In the brain of each one of these rats , I 've implanted thousands of tiny integrated circuit , charge-sensitive oscillators . Local temperature differences are sufficient to provide the necessary energy to power these oscillators , each of which operates at a different carrier frequency . The charge-pattern variations , both in amplitude and time , are telemetered to my special-purpose receiver-computer , which receives the information just as it comes , converts it to binary form , and stores it on magnetic tape . " " Can your little implanted oscillator receive information as well as transmit ? " " You 've caught on , " said Duckworth . " By playing back the stored pattern in the proper sequence , " I said , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reexperiences every sensation as he once felt it . " " Bravo , " said Duckworth . " That 's just what I 've done with these rats . I can make each one salivate as though he were eating . I can send him into paroxysms of terror or even arouse him sexually , depending on which of his experiences I play back . " " Will one animal respond to another 's recordings ? " " In principle it can be done , " said Duckworth . " But it would require the utmost care in matching up corresponding sites . " I fixed my eyes on him . " Are you thinking of trying out this scheme on a human being ? " Duckworth shrugged . " I 've been toying with the idea , " he admitted . " But  | choosing and convincing the subject might be a ticklish matter . There are surgical risks . " " To put it mildly , " I said . Then I backed away from him . " Do n't consider me , " I warned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not that much . " " I know , " said Duckworth . " I suspect that anyone I 'd approach would react the same way . And yet the rewards could be so great . I wonder if I 've been wasting my time ? " " You have n't , " I assured him . " Publish your results and you 'll see . I had no idea then of how prophetic my remarks were . Duckworth 's sober and rather stodgy account of his method of recording sensations appeared first in an eminent scientific journal . I expected him to get a few crackpot responses but I had totally underestimated the number . " I 've been flooded with thousands of nutty requests from auto-eroticists , " said Duckworth wearily . He had sidled into the Computer laboratory where I was debugging a new program to be used in his system . I shook my head sadly . " It 's an unfortunate truism that every nut in the world is attracted by this kind of scheme . " " But some of these letters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I was a man-about-town ! " He waved a heavily embossed piece of stationery at me . " This one is from the Nazir of Waddam . " " I know what he wants , " I said . " He asks you to record all of his current amatory exploits in his harem , so he can replay them in his old age . " " How did you guess ? " asked Duckworth . He was awestruck by my prescience . I shrugged off the question . It had been purely a  | matter of empathy . I had just put myself in the Nazir 's place . The demented and oddball amateurs posed one type of problem , but each one could be dealt with . The serious difficulties arose when the professionals appeared on the scene like a swarm of locusts . Each one had a surefire deal in mind , and talked in large amounts of dollars . I was afraid that Duckworth might be tempted . Maintaining his research on inadequate funds was wearing him out . And his professorial salary was quite modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oblique ones . One chap persevered , however . He was unstoppable , loquacious , and imaginative . His name was Hart Felsen , a short stout man in his late forties , wearing a floppy straw hat in the manner of vintage Sidney Greenstreet films . His clothes were of first quality , suggesting distinguished Saville Row tailors , but his bulging form inserted wrinkles everywhere . Felsen appeared at the University and made his first approach to Duckworth through the head of the Chemistry department . After being rebuffed , he tried the Dean 's office and finally appealed to President Hinkle , all to no avail . But Felsen was not discouraged . To supplement his research funds , Duckworth reluctantly decided to take on some consultation work for one of the more reputable drug houses . Sometimes these meetings took the form of a working luncheon . With consummate artistry , Felsen contrived to wangle an invitation to one of these luncheons where he sat on Duckworth 's immediate right . He began to chat with Duckworth on the decline in the quality of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sally on the inferior workmanship of new Bunsen burners drew a warm response . A little later , Felsen broached the subject of Duckworth 's recent paper and revealed an  | amazingly thorough understanding of what was involved . Duckworth was impressed with the acuity of his observations . " Could this system be fabricated in portable packages ? " asked Felsen . " It 's all portable now , " said Duckworth . " The receiver-computer weighs under ten ounces with batteries included . " Felsen licked his lips . " Dr. Duckworth , " he said , trying vainly to lean forward against the inertia of his waistline . " Might it be possible for one person to respond to another 's record-ings ? " " You may recall , " said Duckworth , " that in my paper I discussed this very point . I stated that it would require very careful mapping of the proper cortical sites in each individual to make certain of an exact correspondence . " " Of course , " said Felsen , " how stupid of me to forget . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week later , Felsen appeared at Duckworth 's laboratory with a ten-page proposal and a multimillion-dollar contract in hand . Duckworth refused to read either one . " Do n't be foolish , " said Felsen . " You could become completely independent of Government grants and do whatever you wanted to do . Besides , there 's more than money at stake here . You know what pleasure people get from audio recordings . Just picture the reaction to a catalogue of different joyous experiences . We could offer things that had happened to Presidents , surgeons , movie stars , courtesans . The potential for exploration , stimulation , and excitement is unlimited and the monetary rewards incalculable . " " It 's not what I originally had in mind , " said Duck-  | worth glumly . " It would be a gross perversion of my basic idea . " Felsen removed his straw hat and fanned his perspiring florid cheeks . " Let 's forget individual pleasures and cash rewards , " he said . " Let 's think in grander terms . What about One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , for the first time , an American President could actually experience the feelings of a Russian Premier and vice versa . Two otherwise hostile peoples could interchange vital life experiences with one another . For the first time in the history of mankind , a real pathway to permanent peace between nations might be in our grasp ! " Duckworth was shaken but only momentarily . " It sounds good , " he said , " too good . But I do n't believe the idea could ever be implemented . Not only two hostile individuals , but two hostile nations , would have to agree to submit wholesale to very delicate brain surgery to make it all possible . If these people ca n't agree now on less substantive matters , how could we ever get agreement on your proposals ? " " Nations have traded hostages before this , " said Felsen . " This scheme would simply be another variation on the hostage scenario . Give it a chance , Duckworth ! Give generations yet unborn a chance ! " Duckworth was pale . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your idea . " And that , he thought , ended that . It seemed to , although for days thereafter , Duckworth swore that he was being tailed in the streets and even on Campus . He maintained that olive-skinned men had been lurking about , some in the burnoos of the Middle East . Once , as I walked at his side , he nudged me and gestured at a horny-handed laborer type who walked stolidly behind me , his trouser cuffs white with cement dust .  | " See what I mean ? " hissed Duckworth . He moved his elbow knowingly once again at the laborer . " He looks more Italian to me than Near Eastern , " I said . " You 're becoming absolutely paranoid . " My triumph was complete when the laborer joined a construction crew working on the new South Campus building . Duckworth looked a bit sheepish , then he sighed . " Even paranoids have enemies , " he said . Ten days later , Felsen accosted us in the Computer laboratory . Duckworth stiffened as Felsen waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said warmly . " You 've passed the test . " " What test ? " snarled Duckworth . " Let me explain , " said Felsen . " I am really an emissary from your old friend and host , the Nazir of Waddam . His remembrances of your integrity , your courage , and your genius have lingered with him over the years . But he was n't quite certain if your character had changed . " " He has n't changed much , " said Duckworth . " I have a letter from him , suggesting an erotic use of my recording system . " " I know , " said Felsen , " that was part of the test , believe me . But now we can dispense with all pretense and get down to the heart of the matter . The Nazir wants you to come to Waddam . He has a most important proposition to put to you . And he will pay generously . " " I 'm too busy at the moment , " said Duckworth . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spare the time ? Is this what you say to the man who offered you refuge in your time of need ? " He was alluding of course to Duckworth 's flight  | when the news had broken years earlier about his macromolecule . Duckworth tugged at his beard reflectively . " I have responsibilities here , " he said . " Graduate students , laboratory assistants , grant renewal requests . Without my presence , it might all go down the drain . " " Splendid , " said Felsen . " I 'm sure your laboratory would benefit from a large grant-in-aid from the Government of Waddam with no strings attached . " " It sure would , " I interjected . Felsen beamed at me warmly . " And , " he added , " the Nazir has also requested the presence of your friend . We feel that his computer programming experience will be of great help in our project . The consultant 's fee will be quite handsome . " And so it was that Duckworth and I were flown to Waddam in the luxuriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Nazir was there in person to greet us . He embraced Duckworth and his cheeks were wet with tears . Duckworth stepped back out of his arms . " You 've forgiven me about the matter of the harem ? " he asked . The Nazir waved his hands effusively . " It never happened , " he said grandly . At this point I was introduced to the Nazir and I received a rather perfunctory handshake . The Nazir was a tall man , willowy , with a hawk-like proboscis which even dwarfed Duckworth 's magnificent beak . He wore the long flowing robes of his hereditary office and his fingers were completely covered with rings set with enormous diamonds , rubies , and emeralds . I thought it was a vulgar display and said so to Duckworth . " It 's all a matter of taste , " said Duckworth . " Personally , I think they 're colorful. "  | We were escorted into the air conditioned Cadillac of the Nazir and whisked to his palace , some fifteen miles from the airport . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minarets , winding stairways , and limpid pools everywhere . The East Wing was under heavy guard . " The harem , " muttered Duckworth . After a lavish dinner that set my gall bladder into violent reprisals , the Nazir , with Felsen at his elbow , put his proposal to Duckworth . " I am a humane man , as you know , Duckworth . I abhor violence and bloodshed . " Duckworth looked skeptical but said nothing . " After learning of your scientific publication from Mr. Felsen here , " resumed the Nazir , " I conceived of a magnificent plan to end turmoil , disruption , and misery in my country . " Duckworth leaned forward . " Then you 're sharing some of your oil royalties with the people ? Congratulations ! " said Duckworth warmly . Felsen coughed and studied the end of his five-dollar cigar . The Nazir looked alarmed . " Heavens no ! " he said . " I have a much less sordid plan to offer . As I see it , the rift that exists between me and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They think that my life is simply one of sybaritic luxury . They can not conceive of the preparations , the planning , the administrative details , in short the aggravation I go through . I want to end all that . " Felsen puffed deeply on his cigar . " If I may interrupt , your Highness ? " he said deferentially . The Nazir nodded . " What his Highness wishes to say is , that in the interest of his people , he is willing to volunteer to have the necessary surgery to implant your transducers in his  | cortex . But first , the leader of the revolutionaries , a fiercely stubborn man now in custody , will undergo the same operation . You gentlemen will thereupon record the emotions and frustrations of the Nazir in a typical morning 's work . This recording will be transmitted over and over to the brain of our revolutionary friend . He will then be able to communicate to his comrades the terrible hardship of being the Nazir . " " All a matter of empathy , " said Duckworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 're as understanding as ever . " " You bet , " said Duckworth . " And I suppose you had n't thought of recording your harem exploits afterward . " " To be honest , " said the Nazir , " I had . But that was a secondary benefit . What your military industrialists refer to as spinoff . ' " " Well my answer is no , " said Duckworth tartly . " I 'll have no part of this outrageous scheme . Instead of dealing honestly with your people , you want to trick them . " " If I dealt honestly with this scoundrel of a revolutionary , " said the Nazir , " I 'd boil him in oil . But I want to use the modern , humane approach . " " The brain surgery is difficult , " said Duckworth . " The physical risks may be great . I 'd have to personally tutor a surgeon on every single step of the procedure . Is it worth all this to you ? " " My dear Duckworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolutionary volcano , ready to erupt momentarily . If my enemies win , it would cost me my oil , my palace , my life , even my harem . But if your scheme worked , it would be worth every bit of the risk . Besides , if anything goes wrong with the operation , you and your friend would join me in the Gardens of Allah . " " Nonsense , " said Felsen soothingly . " Dr. Duckworth is too great a scientist for any such slips to occur . And  | who knows , we may have the answer to upheavals the world over . Think of it , Duckworth , you will personally usher in a new period of non-revolutionary tranquility . And if you 're still wavering , let me point out that we have the most up-to-date , fully equipped torture chamber in the Middle East . " I turned to Duckworth . " What do we do ? " He sighed . " There 's no choice , " he said glumly . I was disappointed in my friend , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , " I said . " I 'll help you . But only because I 'm a coward . " At these words the Nazir clapped his hands and an exquisite coffee liqueur was brought forward by a turbaned lackey . Hand-cut emerald goblets were filled and passed around . " To my people , " said the Nazir , voice throbbing , and we all drank somberly to the health of that harassed population . Two of the world 's finest neurosurgeons were flown in and teaching seminars were scheduled with Duckworth . My friend spent considerable time in briefing them on the special skills and problems involved in the implanting , and the absolute necessity for sobriety . As expected , the first operation was to be carried out on the revolutionary . Then , if all went well , the Nazir would risk his royal head . Despite careful and intense preparations , the first operation was touch and go . Once , Duckworth became enraged and threatened to take a scalpel to the skull of one of the surgeons . This offer seemed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implanting was finally successfully concluded . Ten days later , when the healing process was almost  | completed and no neurophysiological damage was apparent , the Nazir took a deep breath and went under the knife . This time the performance went more smoothly , to my intense relief . When the Nazir had completely recovered , we were summoned to his royal chambers . " I feel absolutely in the pink , Duckworth , " he said . " I 'm ready to proceed . " Duckworth bowed . " So are we , " he said quietly . " However , it would be dangerous to start prematurely . I 'd like to carry out tests on both of you to make sure that the implants are receiving and transmitting properly . " The Nazir insisted , purely as a precaution , on his first recording being taken that night at the harem . " In the morning , " he added , " you can record my reactions to the rigors of the job . " Even Duckworth was startled at the superb quality of the recordings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated his tests on the captive revolutionary with equal success . Felsen hovered about all the time , ostensibly to satisfy his curiosity , but in actuality to keep an eye on us . The Nazir , however , was impatient with all of the delays . " I want the recordings played back on this fellow , " he said . " And at once . When we are satisfied that they have taken hold , he will be interviewed on our National Television network and then released . " The playbacks were run off without a hitch and the patient carefully interrogated by the Nazir 's psychiatric staff . " This man really believes , " they chorused . " He is not shamming . " And indeed , on the Waddam TV network , he articulated his total empathy for what the Nazir went through daily in governing the country . He expatiated at great  | length on the mind-boggling problems of administering this little oil-soaked country . Duckworth was sitting off to one side , out of sight of the camera . " Then you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The revolutionary sprang to his feet . " You bet I would ! " he cried . " For the kind of harem the Nazir has , anything would be bearable ! " Later , when the man had been cut off the air , Duckworth and I were placed in the same dungeon . " What happened out there ? " I asked . " I ca n't understand it . " " I played two recordings sequentially , " said Duckworth . " The first , under the guise of test runs , was a playback of the Nazir 's night at the harem . The second was the administrative morning at the desk . " " I 'm proud of you , " I said . " But it may mean curtains for us . " " No it wo n't , " snapped Duckworth . " The Nazir is a proud man and the last thing he 'd want is publicity on this matter . He 'll let us go if we pledge secrecy . " " And our generous consultation fees ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did n't . Back in the States , I was tempted to initiate a whopper of a lawsuit but I held down my baser instincts . Duckworth was less restrained . I barged into his office and found him in the act of studying his Major Medical contract . " Anything wrong ? " I asked . " Not yet , " said Duckworth noncommittally . " Are you contemplating surgery ? " Duckworth sighed . " I have n't made up my mind yet , " he said . He pulled out a desk drawer and removed a five-inch reel of magnetic tape .  | " The harem recording of the Nazir , " he said laconically . We looked into each other 's eyes for a meaningful moment . I coughed . " How extensive is our coverage ? " I asked .  | IN THE NIGHT , Sam Schwartz disappeared from his crowded Lower East Side apartment . That 's how it all began . His wife , Hilda , attested to that fact in the morning . The following night , Hilda was gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police investigated and were frustrated by the absence of clues . Even Mrs. Lepkowitz , a neighbor who knew everything about everybody , was baffled . The landlord did n't quite know what to do , since the rent was paid up to the end of the month . Cousin Rhoda , a relative of Sam 's who had always been considered on the strange side , came by with a specialist in psychic phenomena . He walked about , hummed to himself , opened a small bundle of twigs and dried entrails , and evaluated signs . " What is it ? " demanded Cousin Rhoda , finally . " Is it a space warp , teleportation , witchcraft , or mass dyb-bukry ? " There was no reply , since the psychic specialist had vanished .  | One week later , an entire Puerto Rican family had vanished , then another . Eventually , the sequence of disappearances began to mount to avalanche proportions . A bride never made it to the altar , an entire battalion of firemen seemed to go up in smoke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio of ten millions in blue chip securities , was nowhere to be found . People went to bed in terror of what the night might hold . Within months , the population of Manhattan had dropped to one half of its original value with no end in sight . None of the other boroughs reported a similar problem although a few densely populated parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn were beset with unexplained disappearances . It was this factor , I suppose , that gave Emmett Duckworth his first clue as to the basis for the vanishing borough . The great biochemist , now retired to a life of contemplation and minimal sex , was taking his evening stroll through Central Park when I ran into him . " Duckworth , " I said jocularly , " are n't you afraid of being mugged ? " " By whom ? " he said . " There are so few people now left in Manhattan that even the subways are safe . Last week I saw an elderly woman sitting on the Lexington Avenue express . " " That 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's also been a startling rise in pupil reading scores , since so many teachers have disappeared . " " It 's serious , " said Duckworth , " but I 've been devoting some time to the problem and I think I 've narrowed down the possibilities . " I eyed him warily . Duckworth was a genius , twice a Nobel laureate , but an erratic thinker . I did n't always agree with his conclusions . " First , " said Duckworth , " I asked myself , why Manhattan ? Why not Queens or Staten Island ? "  | " Why not , indeed ? " I agreed indignantly . " It ca n't just be the air , " said Duckworth . " Granting the localized character of atmospheric composition , why would some people be affected and not the others ? " " Maybe disappearances take place at differing rates ? " " Perhaps , " said Duckworth . " On the other hand , it might be something in the water supply . " " Or the food ? " " Exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out an item in the local diet peculiar to Manhattan . " " But what ? " I asked . " Ah , " said Duckworth , " now you 've put the problem in a nutshell . " I visited Duckworth in the shabby confines of his private laboratory where a galloping inflation had eroded his once generous retirement pension . He was busy feeding special diets to groups of animals in an attempt to isolate the peculiarly nasty factor . " Have you tried Vanishing Cream ? " I asked . He sighed . " It 's tough enough without your abominable gags , " he said . " Only yesterday my two lab assistants disappeared . Last night the milkman and my maid vanished , followed this morning . by the janitor . There 's absolutely no heat in this lab , or have n't you noticed ? " I blew on icy fingers . " Vaguely , " I said . " The morning papers reported that Manhattan 's population is now down to one hundred thousand souls , " said Duckworth . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now be pure joy . Instead I find it 's a horror . " " There are thousands of empty cabs and abandoned passenger cags blocking the avenues , " said Duckworth.  | " We 're rapidly approaching a vehicular Armageddon . And to top it all , I ca n't even buy the simplest chemicals . " As we both shook our heads , Duckworth 's tiny eyes suddenly turned large and circular . " Did you see that ? " he cried . " See what ? " " The electroscope , " shouted Duckworth . " Look at it . It 's discharged . " " Big deal , " I muttered . " Watch , " he said . " I 'll recharge the leaves . " He touched the input sphere delicately with a slender glass rod , and the fragile leaves parted like the Red Sea , only to suddenly collapse together . " That 's it , " said Duckworth . " It must be a kind of bizarre radioactive phenomenon . " " Maybe there 's something in your lab , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch dial . " " Nonsense , " said Duckworth . " It would take a highly active source here to produce such a sharp effect . " He went to his cupboard , fumbled with the warped doors , and removed a Geiger counter . A moment 's silent tug-of-war followed and he had uncapped the detector probe . The needle shot violently upscale . " My God , " said Duckworth . " There is an active source in this room . " He stalked about , poking purposefully with the probe . The meter movement almost tore loose from its bearings as he neared me . I was both anxious and guilty . " Can I be the one ? " Duckworth eyed me soberly . " I 'm afraid so , " he said . I began to tremble . After a little hesitation , Duckworth put his arm on my shoulder , comfortingly . " Maybe it is n't contagious , " he said , half to himself . " At any rate , I 'd like to examine a small sliver of your skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said bitterly . Duckworth leaned over my finger and deftly nicked it with a scalpel . " That should be enough , " he said . I sat there , biting my nails as Duckworth went through a painstakingly careful series of microscopic examinations of the tissue . I fantasized all sorts of hideous diseases , until several hours later , Duckworth approached me with leaden steps . " Have I got something bad ? " I asked plaintively . " I 'm afraid so . Even under the microscope , cells began to disappear . I 've given a lot of thought to what 's happening and I have a theory . I think it 's spontaneous annihilation of matter which has inexplicably become uncontrollable . " " Annihilation of matter ? " " A current theory of cosmology , " said Duckworth patiently , " proposes that matter is constantly being created and destroyed . The rates usually differ . On Earth , for example , the rate of annihilation exceeds that of creation by a very tiny amount . Ordinarily it would take centuries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some insane reason , an accelerated annihilation of neutrons has begun . Along with this annihilation there comes a breakdown in body tissue which finally results in the total disappearance of the individual . " " Then I 'm done for , " I groaned . " Do n't despair , " said Duckworth . " If I can find the reason for this accelerated annihilation and reverse the effect , you might still hold on to your baby fat . As of now , my only clue is that all of this is taking place primarily in Manhattan . But why ? " The following day , we set out at dawn touring the food markets of the borough , Geiger counters in hand .  | The results were disappointing . Here and there a batch of Japanese tuna cans and Mickey Mouse watches showed signs of radioactivity , but not enough to satisfy Duckworth 's hypothesis . We visited fish markets , flea markets , and knisheries . Our most desperate effort was in sampling the CO , of carbonated water in Lower East Side candy stores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much hesitation , I got on the scales and was shocked to learn that I 'd lost five pounds during the day . " I 'm fading fast , Duckworth , " I groaned . " Who knows if I 've still got a liver ? " " The disintegration is probably uniform , " said Duckworth . " It would probably be proportional to the body mass . " He tugged at his beard . " Proportional to the mass , " he muttered . " By God , that must be it ! " He began to prance about and the overall effect was not ungraceful . " Have you uncovered a new lead ? " I asked . " More than that , " said Duckworth . " I think I 've found the key to this riddle . Manhattan has an enormous concentration of people . What if there is a critical mass of population density which can trigger off the wildly accelerated annihilation of body cells ? That may be the reason that so many of the ancient crowded cities of the Fertile Crescent suddenly lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hope so , " said Duckworth . " If I 'm right , a countermechanism may be triggered off as the density of population drops below a critical threshold . Have you ever noticed how plump the men and buxom the women are on underpopulated isles ? " My salvation lay in Duckworth 's last observation . Looking like a surveyor 's rod , I spent a hermit-like existence on a tiny island in the Azores , where after ten  | months I began to put on weight . When I tipped the beam at 330 pounds , I breathed a sigh of relief and waddled to the mail ship , ready to return to Civilization . Even today , I avoid traffic jams , crowded elevators , and tete a tetes . Manhattan has been restored by a thoughtful municipal government so that visitors can see what its deserted streets once looked like .

Totally depopulated , that is , save for Emmett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own town house with laboratory , a privilege granted to him by a grateful people .  | THE GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT of Ben Coulter 's life was his inability to play the violin well . As a child he had practiced for hours every day , fired by dreams of being a great concert artist . But his fingers were never supple enough and his performances never caught fire . His violin teacher broke the news to him when he was sixteen . He confirmed what Ben already knew , that he could never be anything but second rate in his playing . He went about numbed for months thereafter , and almost as an afterthought turned to electronics , where his mathematical skills could be woven into creative designs . But although he enjoyed his work , he found himself thoroughly disillusioned fifteen years later , carrying out repetitive designs of tapered waveguides for military radar sets . Although his parents had died during his early teens , he remembered his father very clearly , an excitable , volatile man who , as first-desk cellist , had drawn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been filled with music , with his father 's colleagues joining in the performance of little-known chamber works as a labor of love . These memories were still treasured by Ben Coulter . Outside of his music , Ben found little to interest him . When he tried in his off hours to interest himself in ballet or even in the dramatic theater , he found his mind drifting toward themes from his beloved chamber music recordings . Once , in the midst of making love , he had stopped to retune the girl 's drifting FM radio . She had thrown him out of her apartment in a fit of pique , and he was never quite sure why . But now , at thirty-one , he found himself one gray morning with a terrible sense of urgency gnawing at his vitals and a feeling of total dissatisfaction with his life . He went to his closet and removed the violin case , wiping the dust from the sloping sides with great care . He put on a recording of the Bach Concerto in D ( minus the solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the brio he could manage . But halfway through , he was appalled at his own ineptness and he turned off the record player and put away his instrument . He wanted to telephone his supervisor and say that he was too ill to come in that day . But he 'd always found it difficult to lie , and against all of his inclinations , he went into the office . His concentration was tenuous , and he found himself dozing off at vital conferences . His colleagues began to eye him with intermingled pity and hostility , and finally , his section chief took him aside and warned him of how things stood . He decided to make a clean break with the world of missiles , and greatly relieved , he took a job at a small research institute where he ran a poorly equipped electronic laboratory and designed instrumentation for research workers in neurophysiology . Occasionally he was slowed down by bouts of depression , but in the main , I  | the social values of what he was doing carried him through . His most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitter to stimulate tissues electrically through the intact skin . To better understand the application , Ben began to read works on neurophysiology with great intensity , dwelling with particular care on the electrical properties of nerve and muscle cells . When he felt that he had some insight into the values of parameters required , Ben set to work designing a tiny radio frequency unit which could transmit a programmed set of high frequency impulses through the intact skin of an experimental animal . A tuned coil under the skin received these impulses and , with the aid of a rectifying diode , converted them into the direct current necessary to stimulate the tissues . Within a few months , Ben had developed a reliable device to stimulate the hearts of surgically prepared animals . All that was required was to implant the receiving coil under the skin with fine electrodes running through plastic tubing to the heart muscles , and the external transmitter did the rest . The use of the stimulator on human patients with ailing hearts followed next with striking success . Ben received accolades from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not completely dispel his internal malaise , but he was very much gratified . He was even more pleased when his older brother , Abe Coulter , an inveterate horse player whom he rarely saw , came to his apartment and began to heap praises on Ben 's heart stimulator . But soon after , he began to realize that Abe had other motives for his visit . He challenged his brother on this point and Abe flushed . " All right , " he said sheepishly . " But what 's wrong with an idea that can make both of us rich men ? " " How ? " asked Ben skeptically.  | " Why ca n't you design me a pacer to stimulate horses by radio waves ? " At first Ben was stunned , then terribly hurt , and finally , amused . " Of course I could do it , " he said . But he wondered what his colleagues would think of such a sordid misapplication of his device . Still , the money might give him greater freedom to do the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I see it , " said Ben to his brother . " You 'd have to find the owner of a horse who would let you implant a coil under his animal 's hide . Then you 'd have to find a capable vet who would be willing to do the surgery . And finally , you 'd have to avoid being caught by the race stewards . " " I 've got an owner who 's just dying to let you operate on his horse and the vet who would be willing to do the surgery , " said Abe . " Fooling the stewards is something I 'm not sure of . But that 's part of your job . " Abe convinced Ben that he was serious about his offer and so , willy-nilly , Ben had to make good on his word , too . The electronic design was not the basic problem . The main obstacle lay in concealing the transmitting coil on the jockey in such a way that even after an intensive search , a steward could not discover that electrical stimulating techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved this part of the puzzle . He had a tattooed coil of conducting ink placed on the inside of the jockey 's left calf . He then placed a microminiaturized transmitter directly over the tattoo and held it in place with a tiny bandaid . This coil was the antenna , radiating the stimulating r.f. waves . When the jockey placed his thigh next to the slight bulge made by the implanted receiving coil under the horse 's hide , a rectified shock would sent the animal off at extraordinary bursts of speed . Ben was too nervous to attend the first race in which  | the stimulator was used , or even the second . But when all went as planned , he came thereafter to see his horse take commanding leads right from the starting gate and finish many lengths ahead of the field . After ten such races , Ben 's share of the winnings climbed to almost ninety thousand dollars , enough to permit him to open his own free-lance laboratory where he could work alone during the evening and on weekends . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job that was ultimately to have enormous consequences for him . The owner of the race horse who had been so successfully stimulated came to see him one evening in a state of conspiratorial agitation . Albert Field , owner of the horse , was a prominent sportsman and a man with a huge personal fortune . Paradoxically , he had come into the betting coup not out of desire to make more money , but solely because of a pervading need to win at any cost . The ten successive victories of his horse , a cheap and unproductive plater , had elated him beyond anything that had ever happened to him before . Therefore he now sought Ben 's help in realizing a dream that had dogged him all of his adult years . He wanted desperately to win the National Dressage Championships . Since dressage required the horse to go through an extremely complex set of maneuvers in response to the slightest knee pressures and body signals from the rider , only the most patient and skillful of riders , working for years with painstakingly trained animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field was a mediocre rider . He was also an impatient man , lacking the temperament to work the long difficult years that might bring him some order of competence at dressage . But he coveted the trophy with all his heart and soul . He offered Ben a huge fee to  | develop a new transmitting unit which , when operated from a distance , could provide the devilishly complex set of stimuli necessary for the animal 's maneuvers . Ben was intrigued because of the possibilities latent in this effort . He was also aware that the electronic design was again the most trivial part of the problem . Somewhere he would have to find a truly outstanding surgeon , capable of working out the anatomical sites for proper stimulation , using muscle signals to close feedback loops . And they would have to fabricate electrodes which would not destroy nerve fibers when used in chronic stimulation . With the assistance of one of his former colleagues at the research institute , he located a brilliant but unconventional surgeon who had lost much of his practice after an unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination and the style that Ben wanted , and he made an admirable collaborator since he , too , became fired by the enormous challenge of what had to be done . For nineteen months , despite the impatience and overt anger of Albert Field , they spent tedious hours working out the physiology of the problem . And after two and a half years , the job was done . There was a single chilling moment when Field , near the conclusion of the Finals , almost fell off his horse . But earlier , he had carried out such incredibly subtle maneuvers of his horse that the judges could not withhold the cup from him . A stunned audience of blueblood sportsmen sat mutely as Albert Field accepted the trophy which had once seemed totally out of his reach . Afterward , at a lavish party given for a select few at the Field estate , the sportsman carried on in such an unseemly manner that both Ben and Adrian Pennington drifted outside to the lawn , to look at the spring constellations.  | " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what I 've really been after all along . This dressage business was just a preliminary exercise . " " I know , " said Adrian Pennington . " But to work with humans is insane at this point . And no matter what that jury of twelve yahoos said about me , I 'm a careful and fastidious surgeon . It 'll take us another couple of years of chimpanzee work before I could even attempt to program human motor activity . " " Adrian , " said Ben , his voice so choked with emotion that he could barely recognize it , " I 've waited a good many years , and I 'm capable of waiting even longer . But I know that with our techniques I can become a truly great violinist . And now I 've got the money to finance your time in helping me . " " If I pursue this problem further , " said the surgeon , " it wo n't be because of the money alone , although my fee will be considerable  --  out of deference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not two but three years before Pennington learned how to implant multiple coils in the skulls of chimpanzees with separate pairs of leads running to sharply demarcated regions of the cortex . Concurrently , Ben Coulter was working out the fine detail of all the muscular activity involved in playing the violin . The culmination of this exhausting study took place when Maybelle , the nimblest of their chimpanzees , preprogrammed off a tape recording of Joseph Szigeti playing the Bach Concerto in D , gave a commendable rendering of the violin part on an instrument rented for the occasion . Ben Coulter and Adrian Pennington pounded one another , embraced , and went into an impromptu jig that terrified poor Maybelle . When they had calmed down ,  | plans were tentatively put forward to carry out a similar operation on Ben Coulter . " Remember , " said Adrian Pennington . " The risks are great . A good deal of experimentation should have been carried out on human volunteers . " " I 'm your human volunteer , " said Ben , and there the situation rested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seized by agonizing doubts about tampering with his own brain , but he simply refused to turn back . He spent all of the preoperative time working on his programmer , synthesizing all over again the manual and esthetic elements which he had garnered by analyzing hundreds of recordings of the finest violinists , and interviews with leading musicologists . The operation went well . Adrian Pennington 's only regret was that he had given Ben his solemn word not to publish the results of the surgery . And when Ben had recovered from the postsurgical trauma , he set about cultivating his new career as a concert violinist . For his debut before the open microphone of his tape recorder , he chose the Paganini Caprices , a difficult set of pieces and a splendid vehicle for his newly heightened talents . He dressed carefully in formal attire , took his A from the piano and slowly tuned his violin . Then , with just the barest advance in his pulse rate , he turned on his r.f. transmitter . His fingers began to flow along the strings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bowing arm flashed at blinding speed in smooth strokes . Notes took form one after another with a lightness and grace he had never before achieved , and the music swelled into every corner of his room . When he had finished , he turned off the transmitter and played back the recording . He sat for long moments with head cupped in his hands , intent on every nuance  | of the music . When the recording had run through , he rewound the tape and played it once again . It was very good , better than he had ever sounded before , but it was not good enough . His disappointment was sharp , intense . He went to his wall cabinet and took out the reel of Maybelle 's recording . He set it on the recorder and started the playback cycle . It was terribly painful to acknowledge , but objectivity compelled him to admit that the chimpanzee sounded better than he did ! Quickly he telephoned Pennington , who hastened to his apartment even though it was almost two thirty in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , he sighed . " What went wrong ? " asked Ben . " I always questioned whether simply directing the fingers was enough , " said Pennington . " There 's a very special ingredient that must come from inside the violinist . " When Ben Coulter dropped out of sight , Adrian Pennington was quite disturbed . He contacted Abe Coulter and was assured that Ben was all right , although Abe indicated that his brother preferred to be left alone . Pennington now felt free to openly pursue the more conventional aspects of tissue stimulation and plunged into applications involving paraplegics , with results that won him universal recognition . About a year later , as Adrian strolled along West Fifty-seventh Street in New York City , just beyond Carnegie Hall , he spied Ben Coulter , resplendent in a fine dark gray overcoat with velvet collar . He wore a wide-brimmed hat of brushed felt and strode along the street vigorously , cheeks ruddy , eyes sparkling , full of joie de vivre .  | " Ben ! " cried Adrian , taking hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emotional exchange , they went into the Russian Tea Room for cocktails , borscht , and conversation . Ben insisted on ordering for both of them . " I 've become quite adept at this art , " he said genially . " What have you done ? Where have you been this past year ? " asked Adrian Pennington , unable to contain his curiosity any longer . Ben brushed the bread crumbs off the snow white tablecloth and then looked up at Pennington with great affection . " I 'm at peace with myself , now , " he said . " I was crushed at first . I had hoped to make my second life as a virtuoso in the musical world . When I realized that my hopes were futile insofar as the violin was concerned , I decided that I had to enter the musical world in some other capacity . " " And that was ? " said Adrian Pennington , willingly supplying the straight line . " As an impresario , " said Ben Coulter . " I had all the cash I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just completed a successful tour of Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay , and Uruguay , and seventeen other countries on the European continent . " " And your client ? " said Pennington , knowing full well what the answer had to be . Ben smiled . " Who else ? " he said . " My star is Maybelle , our chimpanzee. "  | ON FRIDAY the eleventh of July , 1962 , Irving Pirokin , a ham radio operator working his twenty-watt rig out of a restaurant kitchen on lower Second Avenue , picked up a succession of unusual clicks while scanning the forty-megacycle band . Mr. Pirokin 's instinctive reaction was to take down these clicks as a message in International Morse Code , and the letters J V T A L appeared again and again on his note pad . Before Mr. Pirokin could pursue the matter , he was called out to his post as waiter by the owner of the restaurant , an impatient beefy-faced gentleman with a foghorn voice . When his tour of duty had ended , Mr. Pirokin returned anxiously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care , but to his intense disappointment , he could detect no signals . However , on the following ( and successive ) Fridays , he was able to receive the same repetitive series of clicks at about the same time of day . His curiosity piqued by this mystery , he wrote to his cousin Sam Pirokin in Philadelphia . Sam , by one of those great coincidences that enrich real life , is  | also a ham operator working his rig out of a kitchen where he , too , functions as a waiter . He was elated to find that he was also able to detect the clicks , almost identical in sequence to those his cousin Irving was receiving in New York . Baffled but excited by the cryptic JVTAL , Sam , who was then in attendance at a night school in cryptography , showed the " message " to his instructor , Bertram Luftmensch , a man who had steeped himself in the lore of code-cracking for the past twenty years . Although Mr. Luftmensch prepares a daily coded column for a local Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice for the reader , he nevertheless took time out of his demanding schedule to work on the problem posed by Sam Pirokin . Although Luftmensch tried every trick of the trade , he could not make sense out of the letter sequence , JVTAL . And thus the matter languished for several weeks , with Irving and Sam still receiving the clicks but unable to explain their meaning or origin . One Sunday morning , Mr. Luftmensch noticed that his son was using as a bookmark in his high school Hebrew grammar , the very sheet of paper on which he had worked over the JVTAL sequence . Opening the volume , Mr. Luftmensch took note of the Hebraic alphabet and with sudden inspiration decided to juxtapose the English alphabet with the Hebrew . Using this device , he found that the message JVTAL , read as LATVJ from right to left in the Hebrew manner , became in Hebrew characters , N.11:14 ( Israel ) . With tremendous excitement , he communicated his findings to Sam Pirokin who immediately put through a long-distance call to a candy store in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . Irving was at first unbelieving , but when the import of  | the discovery penetrated his core of disbelief , he reacted with a first-rate suggestion . Irving proposed that he and Sam employ directional antennae to attempt to localize the source of the signals . Although the finances of these two men are generally unstable , relying as they do primarily on tips and the uncertain tempers of innately hostile diners , they each did manage to procure at considerable expense , a highly directional array of antennae able to focus a beam to within one or two degrees of arc . On the very next Friday , by means of crude triangulation , Sam and Irving determined that the origin of the clicks was not some Israeli source ( as they had expected ) , but appeared to come from a position in the sky , roughly corresponding to the position of the planet Mars . Irving was so unnerved by his discovery , that he could neither eat nor sleep for days . The weakness engendered by his regimen produced a purpose tremor in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate of hot soup , and indeed resulted in the near scalding of a customer . It was obvious , of course , that for the first time a clear-cut indication of the existence of sentient human life on Mars had come to the fore . But why was the message in Hebrew ? Irving Pirokin decided to break the pact of secrecy which he and cousin Sam had tentatively entered into , and he showed the translated message to his brother-in-law , Ephraim Zeitz , now Dr. Zeitz , then a theological student specializing in the history of the Lost Tribes of Israel . Zeitz poured himself into this project , using his time and resources without stint and finally came up with the theory which , with certain minor changes , is still considered the most likely explanation of the affair of the clicks . " As is well known , " writes Dr. Zeitz , " the image of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night ' could well  | have represented a primitive atomically energized rocket . We know from the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the general evildoings of mankind had already led the Lord to the near annihilation of mankind by flood . It is quite logical , therefore , that a more advanced group of Israelites , the Lost Tribes , were not transported by Tiglathpileser as is popularly supposed . By utilizing methods of locomotion involving their atomic knowledge , they managed to breach the barrier of space travel and land on other planets , among them Mars . " Dr. Zeitz sent an elaboration of this position to the Pentagon where a prematurely negative response was elicited . But when a field investigator verified the clicks at Irving Pirokin 's receiver , the full machinery of the military was belatedly put into motion . Despite all attempts at keeping the story secret , it was broken to the press by a relative who received twenty-five dollars for scoring a news beat for the metropolitan tabloid in question . It was in this way that the military missions of hostile powers first became apprised of the cryptic clicks . It soon became apparent that the only place where the mysterious signals could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving 's rig . But this phenomenon was easily explained by the vagaries of the layers of the Ionosphere , which often produce these apparent freaks of unique reception . More disturbing was the torrent of criticism which began to erupt in an attempt to demolish the hypothesis of Dr. Zeitz . " Surely Mars can not hold these Israelites , " wrote one scholar . " The surface temperature of Mars is too high to sustain life and the absence of CO2 in the atmosphere would make the preparation of carbonated water , a staple in the ancient Hebrew diet , impossible . "  | " But , " rebutted Dr. Zeitz , " it is this very lack of CO , in the atmosphere that proves my hypothesis . Carbon dioxide is rare on Mars because it is being collected and confined to vessels of carbonated beverage which are sealed . " In the interest of complete honesty , we must make mention of those German scholars who have raised the counterhypothesis which conjectures that the Hyksos were the space migratory group . Utilizing what little is known of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Streitwagen , the German word for chariot , the invention of which is commonly credited to the Hyksos . The debate rages on and the military intelligence groups of both East and West are now engaged in exhaustive surveys of the Martian question . At the present writing , it is almost certain that the West is in the driver 's seat , chiefly on the data furnished by the Pirokins . And what of the Pirokins themselves ? They are both still hard at work at their old jobs . " Even a scientist must eat , " says Irving Pirokin . But they are not lionized by their neighbors . Perhaps the familiarity of daily , intimate contact makes the breeding of contempt inevitable . Max Flenner , a neighborhood haberdasher who is admittedly not on good terms with Irving , since he was the recipient of the soup-spilling incident , has the following to say : " Irving was always weak in the head . Every Friday they chop liver in the back and he picks up the clicks . " We shook our head in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up by his cousin in Philadelphia . " Mr. Flenner raised his eyebrows in disdain . " They do n't chop liver in Philadelphia ? "  | A POTENTIAL educational explosion is lying on our doorsteps . Children as young as two and one half years are now learning to read with the assistance of automated readers . The benefits are quite impressive . The emptiness of childhood play has been filled with serious reading . At the dinner table , parents and children can now argue about best sellers . As one grateful parent remarked , " I find my child interesting , now . " You might think that two and a half years would be the ultimate starting point for formal education . But Science often generates a momentum of its own and mighty leaps are sometimes followed by even mightier leaps . I refer to the work of an experimental psychologist , Dr. Vincent Plenum of the Katydid School in Ohio . Dr. Plenum is a modest , ruddy-cheeked , balding man who singlehandedly has ventured along a path which will make our current educational methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Plenum is now busily teaching the three R 's to the unborn embryo . Like many revolutionary ideas , his approach is sim-  | pie . Around the seventh month of pregnancy , the fetal nervous system is highly developed . Electric probes are now placed on the outside of the mother 's body , just opposite to three critical spots on the infant 's brain . Coded radio wave messages are now sent which store prelearned facts in the cortex of the fetus in the form of electric charge patterns . Initially Dr. Plenum set himself a very modest goal . " It was once believed , " said Dr. Plenum , " that a child could not be toilet trained until it was two or three . Many of my colleagues are now startled to learn that such training can be taught prenatally . Here at Katydid , " he added , his eyes shining merrily , " we have become a diaper-free community . " Dr. Plenum emphasized that all of the techniques used were first tried on animals . Elephant fetuses were chosen , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several were even taught to dislike peanuts . If this were the only accomplishment of Dr. Plenum , he would still be assured of a revered place on Science 's roll of Honor . But he has gone even further . In motion picture films soon to be released for viewing by obstetricians , the prenatal infants are shown carrying out ( after instruction ) a deliberate strenghtening of arm and leg muscles , using a modified form of the Canadian Air Force exercise program . The climax of this film shows several newborn children actually standing unaided , somewhat shakily , only moments after birth . On the basis of several informal discussions with Dr. Plenum , I can report that even now some children are emerging at birth as full-blown scholars , ready to take places in society as creative useful human beings . They are spared the fate of being dead weight , supported by their parents for eighteen to twenty years .  | With Dr. Plenum 's permission , I am going to reproduce here ( with names suitably disguised ) one of the typical case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall call Sam C. Sam 's parents are middle income professional people who reside in Lafayette , Indiana . They heard of Project Amnion through an acquaintance whom they heartily dislike . Because this individual hated the project , Mr. and Mrs. C. became interested in its possibilities , particularly since Mrs. C. was in the fourth month of pregnancy . The C. 's contacted Dr. Plenum and were invited to submit to a series of interviews . Ultimately , they were admitted to the program and each one was allowed to choose a skill or body of information which he wanted the infant to learn in the prenatal state . Mr. C. , a chess enthusiast , jokingly suggested the complete rules of chess with emphasis on the difficult middle game . To C. 's surprise , Dr. Plenum accepted this request as reasonable . Mrs. C. said she wanted the child to speak French at birth . Dr. Plenum did n't even bat an eyebrow . Later , Mrs. C. was wheeled into the " Classroom " where electrodes were placed on her abdomen and instructions given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the attention of the child tends to wander at first . But within a month 's time , one-hour sessions were given on a daily basis . In a letter to Dr. Plenum after the birth of Sam , Mrs. C. wrote , " The greatest thrill of my life came when the baby , right after birth , said Bonjour inaman . ' " Mr. C. was not quite as enthusiastic about the merits of the program , since he found that he could beat Sam at chess , two out of three games . Dr. Plenum has been criticized for failing to provide that his critics are wrong . " The rapid intellectual growth of the fetus takes him past the difficult developmental stages that kids usually pass through . It 's my belief that prenatally educated children will never pass through adolescence . Do you realize what a pleasure that will be for parents and policemen ? " However , all has not been a bed of roses . There has been tremendous opposition from a powerful joint lobby of toy firms and diaper services . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plenum 's side . They are fully aware that the harried taxpayer may be saved billions of dollars . Ernest Hocking , chairman of the Katydid School Board , recently cut the teachers ' salaries . After offering his regrets , he stated in part , " It is our earnest hope that , eventually , we 'll be able to discharge all of our teachers and stop building schools , since learning will be completed before birth . " Dr. Plenum is much more cautious in his claims . " We still have bugs in the program , " he says forthrightly . " Certain motor skills just have n't come off as well as I 'd like . Shoelace tying is still poorly managed . Getting boots off and on is a major problem . Left and right shoes are sometimes interchanged , even by infants trained in Einstein 's laws of General Relativity . " Had the new techniques caused disciplinary problems because critical emotional periods were bypassed ? " Where the bypassing is uneven , " said Dr. Plenum , " smoking sometimes results . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs before he is two years old . " Current gossip has it that Project Amnion is about to swing into high gear . One thousand mothers-to-be have  | volunteered to participate over the next two years . They will have no material inducement other than the benefit to themselves and their children . But they will receive special coupons permitting free 8 x 11 photographs of the baby , to compensate for the loss of similar coupons usually given by the diaper services .  | JOE FOUND MUCH of the Sentient city quaint , even charming , but it was not like home . It was an ancient , sophisticated city on an ancient planet , and yet it did not display the material comforts that Terra had attained after a meager fifty thousand years out of the Stone Age . He walked through the shattered cobbled streets in full gear , outfitted in the smart dark dress blues of the invading forces , looking for women and entertainment . It was not easy to find . Determined to make this a model occupation , the commanding general had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up severe rationing standards . Only three drinks of the potent ragacsi were permitted daily . And at most one woman a day . Meals and food packages were also strictly regulated by item and quantity . Rationing control was handled by the Central Terran Computer . Payment had to be in advance . Small input scan devices were located all over the city which only accepted dogtags and recorded serial numbers plus the  | nature of the transaction . Joe sighed . He had been scouring the shops for souvenirs to send home and he had already used up his quota of drinks for the day . But he still had a woman coming . The Sentients were behaving with scrupulous propriety . They had been badly beaten , but they had n't relinquished their basic dignity . As reparations for their prolonged and costly resistance , they had been forced to give up tremendous quantities of treasure and goods . Hence everyone was living on a substandard basis . But there was almost no black marketeering . There was very little prostitution , too . Traditionally the Sentients used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for erotic pleasures , good enough to pass muster with the most exacting of men . But most of the Terran soldiers , like Joe , considered this practice emasculating , a sign of the degeneration of the Sentient culture , and avoided the android women like the plague . Only a handful of the men , weak in moral fiber and controls , joking to cover their inner shame , had defiled themselves in this way . Fortunately there were a few real women around , whose circumstances were so straitened that they had gone to the streets to earn Terran credits . But only a few . Joe had waited now for fifty-three days . And the torment was growing stronger with each day . He stepped into one of the very neat candy-pink social clubs maintained by the Sentients for the Terran soldiers . There were four women seated quietly about the room  --  all of them android , he was certain . They were uncannily like the Sentient women in appearance . None were pretty by Terran standards . Their noses were too broad , their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . But they were extraordinarily sensuous creatures . He stared at each one in turn ,  | tempted but not quite enough . He took great pride in maintaining his own self-respect , in holding on to his masculinity . He advanced to the bar and asked the Sentient bartender for a ragacsi . " Your dogtag , please , " said the bartender . Joe slipped the metal disk into the scanner and waited stoically for the intermittent red flash to appear . It did and the bartender sighed . " I 'm sorry , sir . You 've reached your quota for the day . But I 'll be happy to serve you tomorrow . " " The hell with it , " snapped Joe . " I did n't want the goddam drink anyway . " He stepped angrily into the street and looked along the narrow lane . There was no one in view . High above , two young Sentient women had been leaning out of an oval picture window but when they caught his glance they both withdrew and closed the outer blinds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he thought , " but it is n't sex alone . I want intimate contact with another human being . " He stopped off at a curio shop and chatted politely with the proprietor . He even priced several expensive items although he knew he did n't have sufficient credits left to pay for them . The Sentient dealer was courteous , but no more . Joe tried to hint obliquely at how lonely he was , but the Sentient did n't seem to grasp his meaning . They parted on correct but distant terms . And then he saw her . She was n't even as pretty as the android women he had seen but she was alive . He was certain of that . She had her head averted and was looking wistfully into a shop window . He came up just behind her and looked over her shoulder . She was eying a lavishly packaged food assortment . " It looks mighty tempting , does n't it ? " he said softly . She turned to look at him , but said nothing . On sudden impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his food allowance on the package . When he came out into the street he handed it to the Sentient woman . " I can not take this from you , " she said . " No strings , " said Joe and when he saw the look of puzzlement on her face , he rephrased his words . " I want nothing in return , " he said . She looked at him warily for a moment and then reached out for the package . He was elated because she had accepted it . " Where do you live ? " he said . " You wish to come home with me ? " " Only to talk . Nothing more . " She shrugged and took his hand in hers , the warmth of her fingers coming almost as a shock to him . Together they wove through the maze of darkening streets , dimly lit by the orange glow of the setting Star above . There were tangles of debris everywhere since much of the destruction had not yet been cleared away by the Sentient population . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home , she asked him to wait while she went within . She returned in a few moments . " I ca n't ask you in , " she said quietly . " My parents will not permit it . But since I have accepted your gift , I feel I owe you something . " You do n't owe me a thing , " he said vigorously . " No , no , " she insisted . " I will go to your home with you , now . " His home ? He had no home on this planet . He was quartered with an elderly Sentient couple in a small bedroom with a private side entrance . He told her this , and she shrugged her indifference . But he wanted more than gratitude . They walked to one of the few parks that had not been shattered by the invasion . It was on a hill of several hundred feet that overlooked a river winding below  | like a metallic ribbon . He talked hesitantly about his parents , and when she looked at him sympathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show to her . She smiled and remarked about the resemblance . He asked her about herself , her family , but she would n't answer . " I see only destruction about me , " she said , and she pointed a slender finger toward the heaps of rubble that lay at the foot of the hill . Then she leaned toward him , and for the first time that evening , she ran her fingers gently over his cheek . His blood began to race at the implications of her caress . " Do you like me ? " he asked earnestly . " Really like me ? " " I do , " she said seemingly in earnest . Although it was terribly expensive , he hailed one of the few helibuses that hovered over the ravaged city . He had the pilot place them down a few blocks before his destination so that he might stop to purchase a corsage . He pinned the exotic flowers , despite her mild objections , to the shoulder of her brightly colored blouse . They entered noiselessly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair and spoke to her of intimate things , of his home , his loneliness , his contrition for the wanton destruction of her city , of his gratitude to her . She smiled at him as she reached out for her purse . She opened it and took out one of the small scanning devices issued by the Occupying Forces . He felt icy fingers close about his heart . " What are you doing ? " he cried . " Reporting the transaction to your Computer , " she said , the word your heavily accented . " I should have recorded it in advance . " " But this was n't just a transaction , " he said . " It was one human being showing friendship to another . " She laughed outright .  | " Me ? " she said . " Human ? " He sat bolt upright in the bed . " What do you mean ? " he said . " You even have parents ! You said so . " " Parents was just a euphemism for my owners , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . " He went to the closet and gathered up her clothes . " Get the hell out of here , " he said . She dressed before him with exaggerated slowness , moving her body in a caricature of sensuality . She curtsied grandly before she left , a grotesque mockery , he knew , of his Terran values . She walked through the streets in a leisurely manner until she reached one of the city 's communication centers . There she called her home , collect . Her mother 's face came alive on the Visiscreen . It was without emotion . " I did it , " she told her mother . " He is humiliated and unnerved . I made him something less than a man . " " It was a courageous and patriotic thing to do , " said her mother . " And yet I wish the glory were being garnered by someone else 's daughter . " Her mother 's face faded from the screen like a wraith of smoke . And then , after straightening the hem of her skirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street looking for another Terran soldier .  | WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED the call from Dr. Bennekoff , I assumed that he had unpleasant news for me . Dr. Bennekoff is the director of one of the finer music schools of the city , and my very talented young daughter is a student at his school . But his request that I visit him was not , he assured me , concerned with my daughter . " Purely a private matter of some importance , " he said . He received me the following day with great excitement , displaying the courtly Old World charm which was a hallmark of his behavior . He shook my hand warmly and ushered me to a frayed chair at the side of his huge scarified desk , a massive mahogany block covered with mementos of his distinguished musical career . I sat there diffidently , trying to keep my fingers in repose and wondering what sort of musical small talk I might offer him . I can not play any musical instrument but I 'm an ardent listener with some small insights into music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're an electronic engineer , are you not ? " said Dr. Bennekoff . His scant hair had come up in little wisps , giving him a fey quality that was ill-suited to his great bulk . " That 's correct , " I replied , baffled by the irrelevance of the question . " My major concern is medical electronics . " " But you know something of music , too , " said Dr. Bennekoff . " And you have taught . " He was alluding , I realized , to a conversation we had had some weeks earlier at a parent-teacher circle meeting , during which I had mentioned some of my parttime teaching activities . " I have taught classes in electronics , " I conceded . For one wild moment I had the eerie feeling that he was going to offer me a teaching position at his school , and what was even more bizarre was that I was tempted to accept such an offer . But he punctured this fantasy in short order . " Are you familiar with computers ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did quite a bit of the logical design for one of the early computers , " I replied . " But what has that to do with our meeting ? " " Just this , " said Dr. Bennekoff . " As you know , we are dreadfully short of room space here . Indeed , we have had to turn away many applicants for courses at the school . And of course I do n't have to elaborate on the desperate shortage of good teachers . " I nodded agreement with this classic lament . " I 've given extensive thought to the matter , " said Dr. Bennekoff , " and I think I know the way out . The Board of Directors is busy making plans to evict the people in the adjacent building and erect a new school building there . But all that will take years and inevitably the same search for space will occur . We have to attack the  | problem more directly and the proper way is through a collrputer . " I was stunned . " A computer ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennekoff . " To begin with , a computer which can teach the piano . " Although I had been taken aback at first by the suggestion of a computer , my thoughts immediately began to take shape as to how such a computer might work . It would have an eighty-eight-key keyboard but there would be no audible sounds save through headphones . The playing of the notes , the tempo , even the degree of pressure on the keys , could all be readily monitored by a computer . And when errors were made , the student would be told , through the appropriate tape , exactly what accounted for each of his mistakes . " A computer of this sort , " I said aloud , " could demonstrate proper technique to the pupil through programmed rolls , very similar to the piano-player roll . " " I see that my suggestion has caught your imagination , " said Dr. Bennekoff . " I 'm delighted . But what I really want from you is an examination of the feasibility of such a device . We are prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction and testing of this computer . It might revolutionize the entire field of musical education . " " I can say right now that it would be feasible , " I said . " I ... " Dr. Bennekoff held up his hand in a stop signal . " I want you to consider it very carefully , " he said . " And of course you 'll be paid for your time . But be gentle with us . " He chucked nervously at his admonition . " It will be a contribution from me to the school , " I said impetuously and regretted what I had said almost immediately .  | I spent several weeks of my off-hours , and some of my working hours too , mulling through in my mind just how such a device should be designed . There should also be , I thought , illustrative films of the greatest pianists of our time , to be flashed before the eye of the student at the appropriate times . I drew up a set of block diagrams illustrating how the new computer would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of multiple uses . I plunged more and more deeply into this project , thoroughly convinced of its practicality . One night as I returned home , bemused by thoughts of how I might save several packages of electronic printed circuit boards and further reduce the cost of the pianoteaching computer , I was pressed into escort service by my wife . She informed me that I had to take my daughter to her piano teacher 's home for the lesson that evening . " iVhy not at the school ? " I muttered . " It 's a make-up lesson , " my wife assured me . " And there is n't an available classroom . " I nodded my head vehemently . Of course , I thought . This situation emphasized one of the reasons for the pressing need for my computer . I had my daughter bustling into her coat and gathering up her music and we were off by crosstown bus to Miss Schwarz 's apartment . I enjoyed seeing Miss Schwarz again . She was a fiercely dedicated teacher , trained in Berlin at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing less than perfection from my daughter . " To me you are not a child , playing well for a child , " she would say fervently . " To me you are an artiste . " The lesson was going reasonably well and I sat in a plush , upholstered chair , half-nodding and musing about the computer that might ultimately supplant this  | impassioned pedagogue . My daughter then launched into the Bach G minor Prelude and Miss Schwarz raised her hand and stopped the child . " The tone is too tiny , " she said . " Think of something big , something majestic , something almost beyond the imagination . " " Jack and the Beanstalk ? " my daughter said timorously . " Grosser Gott ! " cried Miss Schwarz in broken supplication . " I am thinking of the Matterhorn and she says Jack and the Beanstalk . " " May I go to the bathroom for one minute ? " my daughter asked shyly . " Go , my sweetheart , " said Miss Schwarz . " Go to the bathroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned toward me confidentially . " I love that child , " she said in a stage whisper . " But because to me she is an artist , I sometimes forget that she is nine years old . Jack and the Beanstalk ! " I nodded at her as my daughter returned and took her seat at the piano , launching into the Bach prelude . She played magnificently , the tones swelling with almost organ-like sonority from the touch of her little fingers . Miss Schwarz was rapt and when the last notes had died away , she did something she almost never does . " You were magnificent , " she cried . " You took a whole year 's leap forward in that one piece . " " Thank you , " said my daughter , her face aglow at this unparalleled praise . " Tell me , " said Miss Schwarz , leaning forward intently , her face radiant . " What were you thinking about when you played that piece ? " " I thought of very tall trees , " said my daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodding comprehension .  | " With tiny birds , " added my daughter . Miss Schwarz stiffened . " Forget the tiny birds , " she muttered . I thought of the mighty Matterhorn all the way home that evening and awoke in the morning with my brain still awed by its heights . Later that day , I called Dr. Bennekoff to tell him that I was unable to conceive of a computer that could even begin to teach piano .  | LIKE MOST MEN , Amos Handworthy was a creature of many parts . To his business associates he was a sober , calculating entrepreneur , given occasionally to rash ventures which through outrageous turns of luck usually ended well . To his employees he was a distant , ominous figure , wandering through his electronics plant occasionally , staring with pale blue eyes at a myriad of trivial details , sifting through the reject box of discarded transistors , and occasionally stopping to ask a loaded but seemingly innocuous question of one of the production engineers . To his housekeeper he was a brusque , harsh man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sober , sedate , and completely absorbed in his pervasive habit of collecting automata . Very few men had ever seen the eyes of Amos Handworthy come aglow and Manny Steinberg was one of them . Manny was a superb engineer who combined the ability to carry out a sophisticated circuit design with the old-fashioned desire to tinker . It was almost physically painful for him to pass by a mechanical  | device that was not in working order . And so , in his first visit to the Pecos Saloon , a town landmark that had been restored to its pristine decor through the generosity of Amos Handworthy , Manny caught sight of the magnificent music-making machine as soon as he cut through the swinging doors . He proceeded first to the bar and availed himself of the tequila and lemon juice which was the specialty of the house . Much of the town showed the influence of its close location to the Mexican border , the large Spanish speaking population , the frijoles that were vended off street carts , and the tastes in liquor . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass-enclosed music maker , four vertical violins arrayed in a circle with a hoop of horse hair spanning about the four violin bridges , electromagnet stops hovering above the strings . ' A dried-out square of paper had been crudely taped across the glass with the clear inked inscription , " Out of Order . " He had removed the back door of the machine and was examining the innards when he felt a proprietary hand on his shoulder and swiveled about to meet the questioning gaze of his boss , Amos Handworthy . " I think I can make it go , " said Manny , not certain that he could but unable to leave this marvelous array of gears , levers , and multipinned rotating dials . " I 've tried to have it repaired and failed , " said Amos Handworthy . " But if you can do it , it 's worth a thousand dollars to me . " Manny nodded as though this offer had tipped the balance but in truth it made very little difference to him . Even the following week , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violins played the Mephisto Waltz , he accepted the check which Amos Handworthy placed in his hand with some puzzlement , not quite connecting it with the maintenance miracle he  | had just wrought . Handworthy insisted on having the machine play again and again , but after the fourth successful round , Manny had lost interest in the device and was more concerned in downing tequilas than in listening to the music . Later that night , as he lay abed on a rumpled sweatwet sheet , wondering how in hell he had taken a job in this God-forsaken town in Texas , he remembered dimly that his boss , Mr. Handworthy , had invited him over to the stately Handworthy Mansion . He was not sure when the invitation was for , or whether the occasion was of a business or social character , but he knew that it was mandatory that he come . Fortunately , a handwritten note on gray , unembossed letter paper arrived the following day , confirming the invitation and specifying a dinner date the following Friday evening at 8 P.M. Manny 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest restaurants in the country but he had never been to the home of a truly wealthy man before . It was with no little trepidation that he appeared at the door of the Handworthy Mansion and was ushered into the house by the liveried butler who was , to Manny 's intense surprise , white . He was somewhat taken aback to find that he was the only dinner guest and that the burden of making conversation would be totally his job . But he found that contrary to his expectation , Amos Handworthy did almost all of the talking . The food was plentiful but not lavish or exotic in character . Mr. Handworthy himself carved out liberal slices off the huge side of beef that was brought in on a , " great silver salver . And although Mr. Handworthy did not drink it , the wine was carefully chilled and of good Out not the best ) quality . Since Manny had been raised in a low-income Jewish section of New York City and had , despite his extensive  | rootless shifting about the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself quite taken with the rambling tales that Amos Handworthy told of his town 's history . " My father , " said Amos Handworthy toward the close of the dinner , " was one of the last frontier marshals and maybe the greatest . His draw was reputed to be so fast that the eye could barely follow it and he never missed his target . " " But he drank like a fish , " he thought , " and spent most of his time at the sporting house on East Maple . " " As a boy , " he said aloud , " I could think of nothing more ideal than to follow in his footsteps when I grew up . Handworthy sighed . " Course , when I had grown up , there was no more frontier , no more showdowns in the center of town . It was a terrible disappointment and one that I have n't gotten over , even yet . " " My father , " said Manny pensively , " claimed that I had clumsy wooden hands . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd never admit it to me . " " Do you know what disturbs me ? " said Amos Handworthy . " There have been challenges for me , some financial , some physical , others social , and I 've met and beaten every one of them . But I 've never been in the same mother naked kind of situation my father had to meet , where it was one man 's raw courage and skill against another 's . " " The thing that disturbs me , " said Manny , " is that whenever I knock off a particularly tough job , instead of being elated , I 'm totally depressed until the next challenging one comes along . " Amos Handworthy raised the wine bottle to the light and studied the play of color through the thickened glass .  | " Come inside , " he said abruptly . " I 've got something special I want to show you . " Manny followed after his host and found himself in a huge , high-ceilinged room flanked on all four walls by reward posters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no furnishings in the room , just a series of unusual pieces of furniture that proved on closer scrutiny to be automata of diverse types . In the center of the room was a great amorphous mass covered by an enormous sheet . " I have no kin , " said Handworthy , staring possessively about him . " I 've never married so I have no children . But I 'm a happy man , nevertheless . These are my children , " he said , gesticulating about him . " This one is a particular delight , " he added , his voice swelling with pride as he brought Manny over for a closer view . It was a gray enameled case surmounted by a glistening blue hemisphere adorned with tiny stars of silver and gold . Within the hemisphere was an exquisite miniature ballroom , the walls lined with mirrors , and when Handworthy wound up the movement and released the catch , two groups of tiny dancers began to waltz toward each other . Their images were caught up and multiplied a hundredfold in the mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a harp were plucked below in the gray enameled case . Before Manny could comment , he was whisked over to a superbly crafted wooden figure of a charming child , a painted smile wreathing the gently carved mouth . The child was seated on a mahogany stool , and when the latching hook had been lowered , it leaned forward and after dipping a feathered pen into an inkwell , began to write in smooth cursive flow . When she leaned back , her motions apparently brought to a close , Manny bent forward and found to his intense amazement a beautifully crafted letter of some fifty words written to the mother of the child .  | There were other amazing sights , an android that fingered and breathed wind into a flute that played sweetly , a reclining Cleopatra that rose , bowed gravely at the waist , and then lay down once more upon her feathered couch . Since each of the treasured machines was in perfect functioning order , Manny rapidly lost interest and merely followed Handworthy about , nodding politely , his mind distant upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was jarred back to reality when , with the reverence that one would use to lay bare a sleeping nymph , Handworthy removed the sheet from the huge centerpiece of the room . It was a small segment of a'Vestern street , complete with hitching post , before which stood an uncannily life-like figure of a town marshal , complete with vest and badge , chaps and holstered gun . The painted face was scowling and from closer scrutiny it was apparent that the figure was capable of complex motion . " The others , " said Amos Handworthy , " are marvelous antiques that I 've collected , but this fellow was made to my own specifications in Switzerland . His clothing is quite authentic and he really works . Watch this ! " He stepped forward and took a loosely draped gun belt off the hitching post to the right of the Marshal and buckled it about his waist . " The device is electrically operated , " he continued . " The instant I draw , the Marshal draws too , and the trick is to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that flashes out of my gun , before he can get off his shot . I can adjust the speed of his draw within fairly wide limits and I 've been moving him up to faster and faster speeds . But I 've gotten pretty damn fast . " With a drawing motion that was almost a blur , he whipped out his gun and pulled the trigger . The Marshal was fast , but apparently not as fast , for suddenly a  | recorded voice bellowed in pain and gasped , " You got me , you dirty varmint . " " A little touch of my own , " said Amos Handworthy . " That 's what happens when I hit him . " He looked down at his gun , almost proudly , and Manny had the eerie feeling that it was only with restraint that he did not blow the imaginary smoke away from the gun barrel . " That 's a highly imaginative device , " said Manny . " He is , " said Amos Handworthy . " But he 's still not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that you can make him the kind of opponent I need . " " What do you want ? " said Manny . All of his ennui was beginning to evaporate and the familiar exultant response to challenge had begun to grow in him . " I want him to be able to hit me , too , figuratively speaking , " said Amos Handworthy . " As things stand now , this shootout is entirely one-sided . I 'd like to know , for instance , if he 's been able to hit me . " " I can do it , " said Manny . " You 'll have to get me off my regular project , but I can do it . " " I 'll call your division chief in the morning , " said Amos Handworthy . " You 'll stay here with me and you can have all the time you need . " Manny did not sleep well in his spacious , overly comfortable bed . He was up early the following morning , poring over the construction plans for the Marshal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical thoroughness , had included in the neatly packed maintenance kit . He caught the guiding concept of the design at once , and made his plans to modify the Marshal along lines that incorporated control techniques that were basically electronic . He phoned the plant and requisitioned integrated circuits , transistors , metal film resistors , capacitors , and various other components necessary for his task . Handworthy did not approach him as he worked and his  | meals were served to him either in his own room or the great room where all the automata were located . He made all the changes himself , snipping leads , soldering , forming tight mechanical joints with deft fingers that almost seemed alive and apart from his body . Ten days later , he called in Amos Handworthy and demonstrated what he had done . " I 've modified both guns so that you and the Marshal will now shoot at each other with ultraviolet light . You 'll both wear vests that are sensitive to this light . I monitor the hits electrically by measuring the resistance of those areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will occur unless you or the Marshal are hit in such an area . Furthermore , you can both continue to shoot for an indefinite length of time . However , I 've altered the Marshal 's aiming mechanism so that if he 's hit in a vital spot , he wo n't shoot as accurately . Similarly , if you are hit , a defocusing mechanism operates on your light bulb so that your gun is no longer as accurate . And instead of the recorded voice , if either of you is hit in the heart , your gun goes dead . " Amos Handworthy 's eyes began to glow with a fire such as Manny Steinberg had never seen and it excited him that his work had brought on so wonderful a response . He slipped the new vest on Handworthy , handed him the wired holster and gun , and stepped back . After fastening his belt and readying himself , Handworthy drew as before and fired swiftly at the Marshal , who was firing back almost as rapidly . Suddenly Handworthy stopped and looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . " He 's killed you , " said Manny drily . " You beat him to the draw , but he 's hit you in the heart . " " I see , " said Handworthy slowly . " Then it looks like I 've got a hell of a lot more practicing to do . " It was a full month before Manny Steinberg was in-  | vited back to the Mansion , and with great pride his host demonstrated how he killed the Marshal , every time . " I 've got him set for his fastest draw , too , " said Handworthy . " At this point , he 's just no match for me . " " I guess that wraps it up , " said Manny , knowing full well that it could n't end this way . " You 're just too damned good . " Amos Handworthy shook his head slowly . " You do n't believe that and neither do I. It 's an unfair battle , unfair because we 've excluded the most vital element of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny although the answer popped into his head even as he spoke and he began to envision the approach that had to be taken . " There 's no fear in this situation , " said Handworthy . " When two men were in an actual shootout they were both afraid of being killed . But the Marshal is oblivious to fear and so for the most part am I. Suppose for instance in some way you could make him shoot better if I were nervous and shoot less accurately if I were deadly calm . " " There is a way to do that , " said Manny . " I can electrically monitor your vasomotor reflexes by means of your pulse and sweat reactions . Then I would program the Marshal 's reflexes in just the way you suggest . But the thing I ca n't understand is how such a step would have any real meaning . Why in God 's name would you ever be frightened ? There 's nothing in this situation to make it happen . " " I have a very vivid imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no playmates and still I populated an entire world in my mind , every one a distinct person . Do n't you see , I can project myself into feeling that I 'm in the real life and death situation just as long as the Marshal becomes a creature sensitive to fear . "  | It took Manny almost three weeks this time to make the requisite changes and he carried out in addition an extensive series of pulse and skin resistance measurements on Handworthy . When he was satisfied that the Marshal had reached the ultimate state , he called in Handworthy and demonstrated what he had done . " I 've installed , " said Manny , " a feedback circuit that 's inoperative when your typical emotional reaction exists . But the circuit comes into play when you become more nervous than usual and the Marshal will therefore shoot faster and more accurately . On the other hand , if you should become less concerned , calmer perhaps , the Marshal 's aim would tend to go askew and his firing rate would slow down . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nervous system whenever you strap on your shooting vest . " " Fine , " said Amos Handworthy and the brilliance of his usually lackluster eyes gave an added emphasis to the word . " You 've surpassed my greatest expectations with these new changes . And while I know it was n't part of our bargain , I intend to add a pretty big sum to your monthly check . " " Thanks , " said Manny automatically . Already he was becoming aware of the depression that followed his engineering triumphs . As he left the house , he had almost completely lost interest in his accomplishment . Meanwhile Amos Handworthy was examining the guns with great care , particularly the tiny switch that activated the firing cycle . It was evident to him that as soon as his gun lifted off the switch , electrical activity began . After first unplugging the Marshal 's electrical cable , he carefully removed the ultraviolet loaded guns from the fixture in his holster and the Marshal 's holster and replaced them with beautifully machined Colt .45 's that were loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mechanical ac-  | tion will be the same , " thought Handworthy , " and now the element of real fear , both mine and his will be in the picture . We 're going to have a real shootout , the kind you do n't see anymore . " He replaced the plug in the wall socket and turned about to face the Marshal quite squarely , shifting his belt around so that his gun would clear free of the holster . The Marshal stared at him out of sightless painted blue eyes , his mechanical hand resting stolidly on his gun . " Even now , it is n't an even match , " thought Handworthy ruefully . " I could n't be any calmer than I am now . I guess it never can come out just exactly as I want it to . " As his fingers flashed lightning fast to his gun , it suddenly occurred to him that Manny was right , that he and the Marshal were indissolubly linked through his own nervous system . He had no kin , no wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth really tied to him . And in that instant , a terrible surge of fear came over him at the thought of killing his own .  | WHO AMONG US has not speculated on the whereabouts of Judge Crater ?
