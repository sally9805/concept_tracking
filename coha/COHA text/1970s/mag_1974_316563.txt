Pocket calculators , designed originally to assist accountants and engineers , are rapidly becoming everyman 's instant genie . Worldwide sales of these minicomputers are expected to top 13 million this year and are growing in the U.S. alone at the rate of 400% annually . As prices drop ( one model was selling for only $22 last week ) , consumers are snapping them up to check cost-per-unit prices at the supermarket , balance checkbooks , figure out tax returns and do their schoolwork . But all work and no play makes even a calculator a dull gimmick , and now the little machines can be used as electronic Merlins . <P> The extracurricular role of calculators emerged as mathematically minded users found that the versatile devices could be used to play sleight-of-button games and spell words . Because on most calculators , the glowing digits of the readout screen , when inverted , look more or less like letters of the alphabet , * the calculator owner can use the machine to compose more than 100 words and endless riddles . For example , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : put 42.46407 into the machine , divide by 3 and multiply by 5 . Upside down the machine spells ShELL OIL ( the floating decimal separates the words ) . Faced with a parking ticket , the calculator owner can come up with Oh hELLS BELLS . To greet a friend , you divide 98 by 7 to get hl . A greater challenge is to ask friends what a golf duffer and the movie Casablanca have in common . If you punch 2572 , add 87 and multiply by 12 , and then hold the machine upside down , it will spell BOGIE . <P> These are not the only games calculators will play . They can perform mathematical magic acts undreamed of by their designers . An example : take a figure that is double your age . Add 5 . Multiply by 50 . Add the amount of change in your pocket , up to $1 , and subtract the number of days in the year . Add 115 . Divide by 100 . The calculator will display two numbers to the left of the decimal point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the correct amount of money . <P> Already it looks as if commedia della calculator will fast become a national craze . Says James Rogers , an editor of Scientific American magazine : " I went through the stage of saying ' I do n't need one of these . ' But once you get one , it 's sheer bliss . " To achieve BLISS , punch 441304 , divide by 8 and add 15 . <P> * Numbers used and letters they can make 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 O I Z E h S L B G
