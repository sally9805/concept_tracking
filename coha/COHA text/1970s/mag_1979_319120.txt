Musical Comedy Tonight , Oct. 1 , PBS , 8p.m . <P> <P> Without the American musical theater there might not be any American theater . Except for a very occasional O'Neill or Williams , the great writers of the U.S. stage have not been playwrights but composers and lyricists : Irving Berlin , Cole Porter , Jerome Kern , Richard Rodgers , George Gershwin , Frank Loesser , Leonard Bernstein , Stephen Sondheim , to name but a few . Beginning with the first modern musical , Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II 's Show Boat ( 1927 ) , these writers have created a durable and increasingly versatile native art form . Broadway musicals at their best fuse music , dance , drama and plain old show biz into total theater . <P> Musical Comedy Tonight is a serious attempt to explain just how the American musical grew up . The show 's host and creator , Sylvia Fine Kaye , is a songwriter ( for her husband Danny ) and a teacher ( at the University of Southern California and Yale ) . Her TV special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 minutes the audience watches 14 numbers from typical musicals of different eras : Good News ( 1927 ) , Anything Goes ( 1934 ) , Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) and Company ( 1970 ) . In between , Kaye describes the genesis and innovations of each show , augmenting her observations with demonstrations at the piano and interviews with Broadway veterans who helped create the originals . <P> The numbers are exceptionally well done . Rather than restage them for television-a deflating technique endemic to PBS 's Theater in America series-Kaye shoots them on a proscenium stage , usually with the help of the original set designs , orchestrations and choreography . <P> At times she even enlists the original performers : Ethel Merman belts Anything Goes and Gemze de Lappe dances Oklahoma ! ' s dream ballet as if these shows had never closed . Bobby Van and Bernadette Peters , who were not born when Good News opened , summon up the sentimental performing style of the ' 20s so well that their rendition of The Best Things in Life Are Free is surprisingly touching . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose Vegas slickness dissipates when he leads the chorus in Oklahoma ! Only Carol Burnett and Sandy Duncan disappoint : their broad delivery blunts the wit and anger of two Sondheim songs from Company . <P> Kaye 's enthusiastic narration packs in as many anecdotes as possible . She describes Rodgers ' legendary composing speed ( ten minutes for Oh , What a Beautiful Mornin ' ) and nudges Merman into an unflattering reminiscence of Porter 's voice ( " He sang like a hinge " ) . With the aid of Choreographer Agnes de Mille , Kaye re-creates the excitement kindled by Oklahoma ! , the first musical to integrate all its songs into a story . A few of Kaye 's points are debatable . She sweepingly dismisses rock musicals , even though rock is not necessarily incompatible with musical theater . ( Indeed , the Beatles sang a song from The Music Man on their first hit American album . ) Kaye 's list of ground-breaking shows ignores such obvious candidates as Porgy and Bess , Pal Joey , The Most Happy Fella , West Side Story and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musical Comedy Tonight is billed as the pilot for a series . By rights , it ought to run as long as the great musicals it celebrates . <P> - Frank Rich
