In California , beer and wine courses can lead to heady jobs <P> The sun is shining , the quarter is almost over and an enterprising band of seniors at the University of California at Davis is merrily quaffing homemade ale amidst the beakers and burners of a science lab . But wait . One of them is throwing his brew down the nearest sink . Has the ale addled his head ? Have the suds gone stale ? <P> Neither . The group is really hard at work . They are part of an 18-member malting and brewing science lab class that has just tasted and discarded a **25;4622;TOOLONG ale . The only college course on brewing in the U.S. , the lab comes under the auspices of Davis ' food-science department , itself part of the university 's highly touted agricultural college . Beer posters adorn the walls and beer bottles crowd the shelves , but brewing is no frothy business here . Only students who have taken biochemistry , microbiology and the like can take the fall lecture course and the lab work that follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spigots of a miniature brewery that looms like some Rube Goldberg creation in their Cruess Hall lab . After breaking down 20 commercial beers chemically , the students then create their own original product . Fruits of this term 's efforts : a barley wine , a dark German-type beer and a low-carbohydrate model . But both state laws and college custom decree that all potions be discarded after taste tests . " Sentence one , day one : there will be no abuses , " says Microbiologist Michael Lewis , a ruddy-faced Welshman who has taught the course since 1964 . <P> Not far from Cruess Hall , Dinsmoor Webb , a trained chemist , heads an even bubblier enterprise : Davis ' 98-year-old program of viticulture ( grape production ) and oenology ( winemaking technology ) , the foremost facility and oldest department in the country. * A diminutive figure who sports dashing mixes of plaid shirts , tweed jackets and velvet bow ties , Webb reigns over 150 grape-growing acres , 14 faculty members and 155 students , all of whom have completed chemistry , physics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they should have a little French , " says Webb , " but we do n't require a foreign language any more . " <P> Webb 's domain extends underground to a huge wine cellar where some 95,000 bottles of student wine are aging gracefully . Like the beer , alas , all 95,000 bottles will go right down the drain once a panel of faculty and staff has rated their taste and bouquet . Along with such courses as " analysis of musts and wines " and " wine production , " Davis offers a course on " sensory evaluation . " But its strictly scientific approach sets it apart from the wine-appreciation courses that have germinated on some 300 U.S. campuses . <P> To Webb 's oenology students , wine is not the " blushful Hippocrene " extolled by Keats but a complicated blend of ethyl alcohol , polyphenols and a hundred other compounds that must be subjected to decidedly unromantic analysis . At the moment , the department is trying to aid the time-honored sniff , sip and taste method of judging wines with a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds in wine .
