HIS life is a road map of modern architecture . The turns it took were his turns , the direction he pointed became the thruway . He is the compleat designer-of everything from kitchen cabinets to entire cities . <P> At 70 , Marcel Lajos Breuer wears 50 years of achievement as easily as one of his old tweed jackets . Indeed , he seems almost cherubic , a stocky , gentle man with a merry twinkle in his blue eyes . The more celebrated Walter Gropius was a teacher ; Ludwig Mies van der Rohe built crystalline monuments to a formula of his own devising . Unlike them , Breuer has touched and warmed contemporary American life by following a simple philosophy : " Architecture is a social art . It has an obligation to people . " <P> " How do you say thank you to such a man ? " asks Arthur Rosenblatt , a director of architecture and planning at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum of Art . The Met 's answer is visible this week . For the first time in its 102-year history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three central galleries to Breuer 's projects . <P> The usual models and photographs of architectural projects are there , but also huge replicas of columns and wall details that convey the magnitude and impact of buildings . Regrettably , the effect is to emphasize Breuer 's late work . While structurally forthright and beautifully executed-he considers every detail down to how his materials will weather over the years-these immense , sculptural buildings tend to lack the grace , originality and controlled exuberance of his earlier projects . <P> Breuer was born in 1902 , a doctor 's son in the university town of Pecs in southern Hungary . Knowing precisely what he wanted , he turned up at the age of 18 at the most stimulating and revolutionary design school the world has ever seen-the Bauhaus in Weimar , Germany , founded by Walter Gropius . The Bauhaus recognized the force of industrialism , the beauty of the machine , the potential of designing a new man-made environment by cross-pollinating the arts . <P> From the first , Breuer showed an original spirit ; he slept on top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He quickly questioned the Bauhaus slogan of " Art and Technology-a new Unity . " It implies , he said , that " art is wonderful , technology is wonderful , so the two together must be twice as wonderful . That is not so . " As for the famous tag- " form follows function " - Breuer wryly added : " Not always . " What he aimed at was " something simpler , more elemental , more generous and more human than a machine .
