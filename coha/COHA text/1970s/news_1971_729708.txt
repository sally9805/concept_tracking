txt George Romney , secretary of housing and urban development , explained today his department 's move to appeal Federal District Judge Richard B. Austin 's decision Friday to freeze $26 million in federal funds for the Chicago Housing Authority CHA . " We think that the HUD department should determine the discipline rather than the court , " said Romney in an interview . Romney made it clear that he agreed unquestionably with Judge Austin 's original decision in the case dating to 1966 ? that , in effect , the CHA was following discriminatory procedures in its assignment of public housing sites . Backs HUD Authority Romney also emphasized that at this point , he felt the discipline considered by the department ? withholding $20 million in neighborhood development progrhm funds if the city does not meet its site seGeorge Romney lection deadline of Dec. 15 ? should be administered by his department . Austin has ordered a freeze on Model Cities funds , which , according to Romney , " affect primarily the poor people in Chicago , " and also include mostly social programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a search of records , it is believed this is the first time Model Cities funds have been denied a city under similar circumstances . If the city does not meet the Dee . 15 deadline to find the sites , it would lose the $20 million permanently , Romney ' emphasized . Point of Concern Romney said that Austin 's decision had national significance . He added that one reason he was concerned ' about the decision is the Ignoring of HUD 's discretion in determining how " we should bring about compliance . " The HUD secretary said the policies which resulted in the Chicago situation predated the Nixon administration . Romney pointed to President Nixon 's statement of last June 11 on federal policies concerning federal housing . Asked about the President 's statement last December that " I believe that forced integration in the suburbs thru use of federal funds is not in the national interest , " Romney said he agreed completely with that position . " Most Explosive Problem " Romney called the issue of integrated housing " the most explosive of all problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that to try to achieve integration thru force at this time would result in resistance that would make the program impossible . He said : " In Chicago , if you want to tell the time of day , just look at the expressways . In the morning , the blacks are trying to get to the outer areas where the jobs are , and the whites are trying to get in to downtown . At night , it is just reversed . " To try to solve these problems on the basis of the center city , the legal city , is unrealistic , because " Chicago is not just the city , " he said . " The real Chicago is metropolitan Chicago , and that means the suburbs . " If integrated housing can not be forced on the suburbs , then why should it be forced on thus far segregated areas of the city where it may not be wanted , either , Romney was asked . " The department HUD builds no housing , " he said . " Chicago does not have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city requests them and meets our requirements . " Romney frequently pointed to Mayor Daley 's written agreement of last May 12 that the city would abide by a timetable under which 1,700 sites would be chosen and prepared for acquisition by Dec. 15 . The city has fallen behind in meeting various dates within the timetable . Other Views Told He stressed that he does not object to participation of the courts in housing matters . He observed that compared with desegregation of schools which began with a 1954 United States Supreme Court decision , " we are much earlier in the area of what law means in housing as opposed to education . " tie naa a worn of advice for communities in all big cities . Urges Communities to Act " At this point nationally , communities in metropolitan areas can take the initiative and determine how the housing needs of all citizens can be met , or they can wait until such programs are imposed on them by the courts , or other agencies , " Romney said . To underscore his point , Romney pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . Speaking of the questions that arise locally when governments " hammered out their individual local land use policies which are not appropriate for federal intervention , " Nixon warned : .. They no doubt will end up in the courts if they are not satisfactorily dealt with outside the courts thru timely and enlightened local . action . "
