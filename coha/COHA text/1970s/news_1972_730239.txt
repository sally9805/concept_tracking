txt Environmentalists have won a major victory in the Nixon administration decision to ban nearly all domestic use of the pesticide DDT . Yet even as they acknowledge this , many environmentalists remain skeptical of the depth of the Nixon commitment to the many-pronged fight against pollution . They charge privately that in some areas of the fight against air and water pollution the Nixon administration has been unwilling to seek adequate funds to do the job effectively . As an example they point to a study conducted by the comptroller general of the United States and released last week by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie . It said the government 's Environmental Protection Agency has neither the funds nor ? as a con- sequence  --  the manpower to supervise adequately the auto-makers ' auto-emission tests . The DDT question at this ' moment is an important issue internationally as well as within the United States . Developing countries are banking on DDT 's unquestioned effectiveness as a pesticide to increase their food yield , thus increasing their agricultural efficiency . The issue is being discussed during the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nixon administration gets a mixed reception from many observers here for its antipollution efforts . On the positive side , the ban on most domestic uses of DDT , announced Wednesday , is the second major action in about a month that strongly supports environmental needs over economic interests . // *DDT banned , but -- -the seesaw pollution fight // The other was the mid-May decision , also by the Environmental Protection Agency , to deny the request by auteinakers for a one-year postponement of stiffened auto-emissions requirements . Holding that present technology would make it impossible to meet the standards set for 1975 model cars , auto-makers had sought a one-year postponement . But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus ruled that technology does exist and refused to permit the delay . On the negative side , environmentalists were displeased last month when the Nixon administration decided to permit the Alaska pipeline to be built , to carry newly discovered oil from northern Alaska to ports in the southern part of the state . Environmentalists had held that there was a significant possibility of ecological disaster ; the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the budgetary requests of the Nixon administration as evidence that it is not wholly committed to a cleanup of pollution . A favorite target is the funding for cleanup of water pollution . For the two previous fiscal years Congress appropriated much more money than the President had requested . This year the Nixon administration sought some $6 billion over three years for water-pollution , cleanup . The House approved $20 billion for four years ; the Senate $14 billion for four years . ( A joint Senate-House conference committee now is trying to reconcile the two bills ; all concede it faces an uphill battle . But on Wednesday 's DDT ruling , even usually skeptical environmentalists here reacted enthusiastically , at least initially . " A victory for the ecology , " in the words of one . The problem with DDT is that it takes a very long time to deteriorate , and consequently becomes part of the so-called " food cycle . " It 's sprayed on crops , gets into birds and animals , eventually builds up to harmful concentrations . Similarly the highly toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans and can build up within human bodies . In announcing the ban on domestic use of DDT , Mr. Ruckelshaus said its likely substitute domestically for agricultural uses will be metholparathion . Although also high toxic , this chemical breaks down into harmless components much more quickly than DDT . The ruling Wednesday did not ban the export of DDT , which still may be shipped to those developing nations ( and any others ) that care to use it .
