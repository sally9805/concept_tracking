Every year , 100 million worn rubber tires and 26 billion nonreturnable glass bottles are discarded in the U.S. Disposing of them is a formidable problem , usually resolved by burning evil-smelling mountains of tires and burying tons of splintered glass . But there soon may be a neater and more practical solution : using the unsightly , troublesome waste products as construction materials in the 20,000 miles of highways that are built annually in the U.S. <P> In testimony before the Senate Committee on Public Works last week , Richard L. Cheney , executive director of the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute , called attention to an experimental product called " glasphalt . " Developed at the University of Missouri , it uses finely ground glass granules to replace the rock aggregates now used as a construction material for highways . One 58-foot-long test strip of glasphalt pavement , outside the Owens-Illinois Technical Center in Toledo , has held up well during the worst winter in years ; engineers reported virtually no cracking , rippling or holes in the surface and gave it a top rating for skid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; M. , Research Engineer Douglas Bynum , 35 , is testing his theory that the rubber in discarded tires might give asphalt added flexibility and more resistance to cracking . Working in the university 's Transportation Institute , Bynum prepared samples of asphalt combined with ground-up rubber obtained from old tires . Test results showed that the powdered rubber-used as a binding material-increases asphalt 's overall cohesiveness so that it does not split when roadbeds shift slightly or sink . Bynum 's findings seem to be a natural outgrowth of experiments by the rubber industry . Goodyear , for example , has discovered that liquid latex-not a waste product-improves the durability and traction of highway pavement . <P> Nonetheless , there are several remaining obstacles to waste-product highways . It may prove impractical to separate tires and bottles from other refuse . Processing plants to grind the materials to the right size and shape may be too costly . And highway builders must still be convinced that the new aggregates are effective . But Bynum is optimistic : " I think sheer economics favors the idea , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of these materials and get better highways . " <P> Best of all , Bynum says , there would be no foreseeable shortage of materials for the improved roads . Combined with asphalt , the old tires and bottles disposed of in 1970 could pave a freeway that would span the U.S. 23 times .
