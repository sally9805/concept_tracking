A CERTAIN WORLD : A COMMONPLACE BOOK by W.H. Auden . 438 pages . Viking . $10 . <P> Autobiographies or biographies of writers , W.H. Auden has said , " are always superfluous and usually in bad taste . A writer is a maker , not a man of action . His private life is , or should be , of no concern to anybody except himself , his family and his friends . " Accordingly , in place of any vulgar chronicle of his life , Auden is offering this wise and diverting annotated anthology . <P> " Commonplace books " were popular in the 18th and 19th century . Habitual readers kept journals by copying out passages from their favorite books and appending their reactions . Auden has been collecting his for much of his life . Quite correctly , he calls it a map of his secret planet . It is arranged in alphabetical order by a fascinating variety of subjects : " World , End of the " ; " Owls , Barn " ; " Prose , Purple " ; " Prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more literary quotations interspersed with Auden 's comments . To anyone who has read Auden , the book reveals the sources of his poetry as fully and incisively as any autobiography could . It also provides the casual reader with some of the most provocative and diverse literary strolling in years . <P> Auden , who is now 63 , has always been a cultural gamesman . Word schemes , puzzles and categories delight him . There are entries for acronyms , angelology , mnemonics , numbers , foreign phrase books . Always a zealous listmaker , he has included long entries of little-known names for woodpeckers and cuckoos and even lesser-known names for the human genitals ( 17 for the male and a lavish 28 for the female ) , as well as a wealth of arcane anecdote . Flipping to " Anagrams , " for instance , the reader finds the story of a 17th century British eccentric named Eleanor Audley who , having plucked REVEALE O DANIEL out of her name , launched a brilliant career as a clairvoyant . Arrested by a jittery government for predicting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was reminded by the judge that her married title . Dame Eleanor Davis , kaleidoscoped to NEVER so MAD A LADIE . <P> Lighter Side . Literary lunacies abound . Under " Shakespeare and the Computers " is a revelation from an Enfield College of Technology scholar who used a computer to crack the cipher of the sonnets . Solution : Shakespeare was really Edward VI , who , contrary to popular belief , died at 125 instead of 16 after writing all of Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , Francis Bacon and Don Quixote . <P> The lighter side of literary scholarship gives A Certain World only a small part of its total impact . Auden has involved himself in a great variety of intellectual pursuits , from his boyhood mania for lead mining to his mature infatuation with opera . They are all charted on this mental map , though music is slighted because , as the poet points out , " nothing can be said about music , except when it is bad . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
