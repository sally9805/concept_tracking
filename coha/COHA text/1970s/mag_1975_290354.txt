President Ford 's tour through Europe last week gave him no holiday from economic worries . During long meetings in Bonn , West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt urged the U.S. to coordinate economic policy more closely with Europe and specifically to avoid any restrictive moves , such as raising interest rates , that could damage the chances for recovery abroad . Later , during the 35-nation European Security Conference in Helsinki , French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing took Ford aside to restate his well-known position that a return to normal economic growth will not be possible without a thorough monetary reform leading to fixed exchange rates for currencies . British Prime Minister Harold Wilson , who now faces sharply rising unemployment ( July rate : 4.2% ) as well as a 26% annual rate of inflation , expressed the hope that improving prospects in the U.S. would boost his country 's sagging economy . The Europeans ' concern reflected not only the growing economic interdependence of the world 's industrialized nations but their declining hopes for a rapid recovery from what has , outside the U.S. also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The slowdown abroad , to be sure , has been milder than the U.S. recession . Yet as the U.S. economy shows ever more vigorous signs of reanimation , no similar trend is immediately visible in Europe . In the past few months , nearly every government has revised its 1975 growth forecasts downward . The main reason : West Germany 's economy , which accounts for fully one-third of the European Community 's gross national product , has failed to respond to the expansionary program of tax credits and deficit spending launched by the government last fall . Unemployment is holding at record postwar levels ( 4.4% in June ) , inflation has begun to rise slightly ( to a 6.4% rate ) , and exports for the first five months of this year have fallen 16% from a year earlier . The simultaneous slowdown in all the world 's major economies has caused world trade to decline at an annual rate of about 12% in the first half of 1975-the first drop in more than 20 years . <P> The industrial nations do expect some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has predicted a turnaround in West Germany before year 's end , a view shared by Bundesbank Vice President Otmar Emminger . Of the world 's major economies , said the OECD , all but Britain and Italy will enjoy real growth in the second half , a trend that will accelerate sharply in 1976 ( see chart ) . To make sure it happens , Schmidt and Giscard agreed a fortnight ago on a joint $5.5 billion pump-priming effort ( $2 billion to be spent in Germany , $3.5 billion in France ) . Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi Ohira has also promised further steps to stimulate demand . Yet as welcome as that news may be , it will mean little to the 15 million jobless in Europe , Japan and North America . Global unemployment , according to the OECD , will not begin to decline until mid-1976 , and it may rise further before then .
