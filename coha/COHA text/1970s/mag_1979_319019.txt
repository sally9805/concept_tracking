Although he has not quite announced his presidential candidacy , Senator Edward Kennedy has already completely changed the political equation for 1980 . TIME National Political Correspondent John Stacks interviewed Kennedy last week about his decision . His report : <P> The walls of Ted Kennedy 's high-ceilinged office are crowded with the framed memories of his family 's glory and its burdens : Jack with Bobby , Jack and Bobby with a thin , young Teddy , Joe and Rose . The children from all the families . An affectionate note from his mother correcting his grammar . <P> For more than a decade , Ted Kennedy has sat beneath these pictures waiting , reluctantly , for the time to try for his full share of that heritage . Now he has finally moved so close to the long-awaited campaign that his conversation is that of a candidate , not of a politician still considering , as he vows he is , whether or not to run . <P> The pressure to grasp for the nomination began to grow in mid-July , he explains , when Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own campaigns for reelection , began urging him to run . " During the month of August , " Kennedy said of the recent recess , " I had a chance to reflect , the time to review my family responsibilities , and to think about the extent to which my candidacy would be a divisive factor . " He met with his closest confidants , Brother-in-Law Steve Smith and Washington Lawyer Paul Kirk , and he concluded that damaging divisions already existed . Said he : " The things that are troubling the people are troubling them irrespective of whether I run or not . The more important problem is whether we as a country can deal with our problems . " <P> " This is a watershed period , " Kennedy went on . " Recessionary pressures will be growing . Energy issues must be decided . New solutions must be found to the problems of the 1980s . We ca n't look back to old answers . " Kennedy is beginning , gradually , to delineate his differences with Carter . He disagrees , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . Said Kennedy : " People are not less compassionate and decent than they were . They are just more concerned with their families . Can they afford the oil to heat their homes ? Can they afford food and housing and medical care for their parents ? Without reassurance on these matters , it 's hard for them to have any confidence about where the country is going . And this is not of their doing . If we fail to deal with these problems , the forces of negation , of negativism and of self-interest can be released . " <P> Kennedy feels that Carter has not compiled a bad record . " We have not been at war ; he has had some foreign policy success , " says Kennedy . But he returns to the economy as the issue on which he will focus : " Our economic vitality is crucial to the politics of this nation . A strong economy is the best social program we can have . And these economic issues affect the confidence the people have in all our institutions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
