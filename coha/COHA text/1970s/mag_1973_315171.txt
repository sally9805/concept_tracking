This week begins what may be the 1970s ' last extravaganza of American air travel : a record 8,000,000 vacationers taking off on 12,800 flights a day to spend the holidays with family and friends or at sun-warmed resorts . By Jan. 7 , the splurge will end , and so will a 28-year era of soaring expansion for U.S. airlines . That day , new federal fuel allocations will start forcing flight cancellations and crew layoffs on a vastly greater scale than anything the industry has ever before experienced . Airline stockholders , oddly , could benefit by the profits of forced efficiency , but almost everyone else will be hurt . <P> U.S. domestic and overseas lines plan to cancel 950,000 of the 5,000,000 takeoffs originally scheduled for 1974 and reduce flights by 285 million miles . About 275 planes , more than 10% of the airlines ' fleets , will be grounded ; Continental Air Lines figures to save 19 million gal . of jet fuel a year just by replacing 747s with DC-10s on its Honolulu runs . Many of the cabin luxuries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First class may give way to all-economy seating , and tourist accommodations may become more crowded as cabins are fit ted with extra seats . Last-minute reservations and changes of flight plans will become far more difficult to arrange as more flights depart with every seat filled . Nonstop service may turn to one-stop and two-stop , even on long flights between major cities . Youth fares , family fares and other bargain rates could go . <P> The cutbacks vary widely from route to route , but all major cities will lose at least some flights ( see chart ) . Several smaller cities are about to lose their scheduled service altogether , if the Civil Aeronautics Board , as expected , approves the lines ' plans . Pan American has petitioned to drop from its schedule all flights out of Washington/Baltimore Friendship Airport , Philadelphia , New Orleans and nine foreign cities , including Stockholm and Oslo . <P> Airline employees will bear the greatest burden in the retrenchment . More than 25,000 of the lines ' 300,000 pilots , cabin attendants , mechanics , ticket clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off beginning in January . Among the cockpit casualties : ten former Viet Nam P.O.W.s at Eastern and the first women pilots at American and Eastern , all victims of low seniority . <P> Airline executives claim that they will suffer financial damage too . They fear a radical drop in revenue and heavy expenses in maintaining grounded planes . A 747 , they note , costs $25 million , and payments must be kept up whether it flies or not . Some lines have asked for delays in accepting new equipment . These delays have contributed to a renewed cash crisis at Lockheed , which last week announced that it might have to seek new short-term loans . Many Wall Street analysts , however , think that the airlines ' costs will be outweighed by the efficiencies of dropping unprofitable runs , flying planes more fully loaded and cutting employee staffs . Several expect airline profits to rise 5% to 10% next year and are thinking of recommending the stocks as a buy . One worry gives them pause : maybe the Arab embargo will soon be lifted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make all those economies .
