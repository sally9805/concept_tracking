txt The American Medical Association , Already beset by sagging membership : and challenges . to its authority over the prOfession , is being swept by a rank- , and-file rebellion by thousands ' of doctors . The issue is government involvement in the . practice of Medicine and what dissident doctors view as the knuckling under by the association 's leadership to Federal officialdom . Many of the several thousand doctors who gathered here today for the opening of the A. M. A. 's annual clinical convention are angry over what they regard as the sell-out position of their leadership in dealings with Federal officials and the association 's , heads are openly worried about the widening rift . The focus of discontent is a little known law , passed by Congress a year ago , that created a national organization to monitor the quality of every doctor 's professional work , whether it be performing open heart surgery or making a house call , if the services are being paid for by Federal programs . Groups representing 65,000 ' doctors have already voiced some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . The law is bitterly resented // by ma.ty doctors , and 16 resolutions have already been introduced here at the A. M. A. 's House of Delegates calling for its repeal . However , association officials plead that this is unrealistic . " The law poses the greatest threat to the private practice of medicine of any piece of legislation ever passed by Congress , " according to Dr. Malcolm C. Todd of Long Beach , Calif. , the A. M. A. 's presidentelect . Urging Restraint But Dr. Todd said repeal of the law would be both " unattainable and politically naive . " He and the association 's president , Dr. Russell B. Roth of Erie , Pa. , are urging restraint . These leaders are attempting to head off an association confrontation with the Federal Government similar to the one that erupted before the passage of the Medicare legislation in 1965 . The battle to prevent Medicare 's passage cost the A. M. A , about $7-million and an incalculable amount of prestige in the eyes of many Americans . The new issue is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review organizations , or P.S.R.O. 's . One archconservative group of doctors , the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , says the initials stand for " physicians should roll over . " The act , 17 pages of fine print that comprise Section 249F of Public Law 92-603 , orders the creation of groups of doctors who will look over the shoulders of their colleagues to make sure that every medical decision involving Medicare , Medicaid and maternal and child health program beneficiaries is valid . Involves 50 Million This translates to a staggering amount of work involving 50 million people . As an example , it would mean that over 10 million hospital admissions would have to be reviewed every year to make sure that there is a proper reason for ordering a person into a hospital and keeping him there , that the patient 's diagnosis is correct and that the course of treatment is being professionally handled . About 350 specific procedures would be monitored . " It 's like an Internal Revenue Service examining the quality of care , " said Dr. Henry E. Simmons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Education and Welfare . Dr. Claude E. Welch of Boston , president of the American College of Surgeons , told a review organization meeting here yesterday that some medical economists had estimated that up to 20 per cent of hospitalization could be eliminated through this monitoring system . One high Federal health official estimated privately that 25 per cent of hysterectomies now being performed were unnecessary and should be eliminated by the P.S.R.O. 's work , and that perhaps as many as half of the antibiotic prescriptions now being written were unneeded . To Cut Health Bill The Intent of Congress was to eliminate such unnecessary medical services in an effort to reduce the increasing Federal bill for Medicare and Medicaid , which is now $18-billion . If national health insurance goes Into effect , as it probably will in a few years , the Federal health bill could be $50-billion . But many doctors bridle at the thought that review organizations are needed , feeling that their honesty is being questioned . In addition , fines of up to $5,000 could be levied against doctors ordering " health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is stated in the act . Opposition to the review organization law has accelerated in recent weeks as the Jan. 1 , 1974 , deadline nears for determining what size each one will he . The program is due to be operational in two years . One poll taken by a medical magazine found that two-thirds of doctors were opposed to the new system . Dr. James H. Sammons of Baytown , Tex. , chairman of the A.M.A. 's hoard of trustees , said he hoped to counter this feeling by arguing that the act may he amended to soften those features most onerous to doctors . Many doctors are also annoyed at Cost of Living Council regulations that have held down their increases in fees . The result had been that during the wage-price freeze doctor 's fees have gone up only about half as much as the cost of the living . A.M.A. membership is another problem . During the last year the number of doctors paying dues to the association rose for the first time in five years , mainly because of the inclusion of interns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did increase by 2,000 , the total number of new doctors in the country rose 10,000 . The percentage of doctors paying A.M.A. dues has declined steadily over the last several decades . Only 42 per cent of the nation 's 366,000 pay dues to the association noW .
