TAXES <P> In a few more days , storekeepers and their customers will begin the annual countdown of the number of shopping days left before Christmas . Counting along with them this year will be worried economists , who will be watching to see if consumers go on a buying spree that might lift the economy out of its doldrums . If that does not happen , President-elect Jimmy Carter is almost certain to recommend that Congress do the job instead by enacting a temporary tax cut of $10 billion to $15 billion-probably in the form of rebates to individuals on their 1976 taxes . <P> The faint possibility that Christmas buying will spark a business revival is about the last reason that Carter 's advisers see for hesitating on a tax cut . Indeed some , including his chief economic adviser , Lawrence R. Klein , urged Carter to call for a reduction late in his campaign . Others successfully opposed the idea on two grounds : 1 ) such a plea might look like an attempt to buy votes and backfire politically ; 2 ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell $11 billion below target levels in the first nine months of 1976 , might surge about that much above expectations in 1977 and stimulate the economy enough to make a tax cut unnecessary . <P> Both those reasons for delay have now effectually disappeared . The election , of course , is over . And last week the Office of Management and Budget estimated that spending in fiscal 1977 , far from soaring beyond expectations , will actually run slightly below the $413.1 billion called for in Congress 's budget resolution . Nor does it seem probable that the lagging economy will speed up spontaneously . Quite the contrary : all the numbers are going the other way , and economists are once again lowering their forecasts . <P> New Figures . The Government this week will announce new figures on how much the national output of goods and services rose in the third quarter ; the growth rate may turn out to have been even less than the anemic 3.9% first estimated . Unemployment rose to 7.9% in October from 7.8% in September , and layoffs are still spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that after Thanksgiving it will start laying off 8,500 of the 13,300 hourly workers in its Appliance Park complex at Louisville , Ky . Though no one can yet predict how strong Christmas buying will be , retail sales in October rose a mere .3% , to $54.1 billion-less than $100 million above the level of June . <P> Even within the lameduck Ford Administration , some officials are beginning to believe the economy needs some temporary stimulation . Says one Ford economist : " If the numbers do n't move in the next couple of months , no one will stand in the way of a tax cut . " In fact , Ford in his final budget will propose a tax cut of $10 billion and tie the cut to reductions of $15 billion or perhaps $20 billion , to begin about a year from now , in federal spending programs .
