What are the greatest books of the 20th century ? <P> That parlor question has been troubling Philosopher Mortimer Jerome Adler , 75 , partly because the sage of Aspen has an incurable passion for arranging ideas into categories , partly because this is the 25th anniversary of his proclamation , with the help of Robert Hutchins , of the " Great Books of the Western World . " To organize that 5-ft. 1-in. shelf , Adler bestowed the title of greatness on 443 works by 74 authors , but denied it to anyone after Freud and William James . <P> Now Adler is planning an equally weighty continuation of that shelf : a 20-volume series entitled , not surprisingly , " Great Books of the 20th Century . " Writing to the series ' editorial board-including such luminaries as Norman Cousins and Jacques Barzun-Adler asked which modern authors might be worthy of the company of Homer , Galileo and Marx . He added : " I am willing to stick my neck out by nominating the authors and works from which a selection should be made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers is , quite naturally , eclectic . It extends from the popular ( Orwell 's Animal Farm ) to the ponderous ( Sartre 's Being and Nothingness ) . To stimulate the board , Adler professes to consider his selections " woefully inadequate " and urges anyone to " challenge the soundness of my nominations . " <P> The offer is hard to resist . How , one might ask , could Adler nominate Eliot 's pretentious The Cocktail Party and not his superb Four Quartets ? If there is room for the historical musings of Toynbee , why is there no room for Braudel 's monumental The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II ? And if this list is supposed to update the original of 25 years ago , why does it recognize so few living writers ? Bellow and Solzhenitsyn are admirable , but where is the magic of Grass 's The Tin Drum or Robert Lowell 's Life Studies or Thomas Pynchon 's Gravity 's Rainbow ?                @ @ @ @ @
