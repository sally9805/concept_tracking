Some other , possibly euphoric , examples of the effect on consumers of Carter 's energy proposals : the President himself calculated that if his stand-by gasoline tax rises to 25 a gal. , a family of four driving 10,000 miles a year in a car that gets 27 m.p g. would pay $91 more a year for gas , but would get back $500 in income tax credits . A homeowner who puts in $2,200 worth of insulation theoretically can pick up a $410 tax credit free . If Carter 's program passes , the homeowner can arrange financing through his utility , which will add repayments to his monthly gas or oil bill , but his savings on fuel will cancel out the loan payments - or so says the Government . By federal calculation , the average person 's share of money raised by a proposed tax on crude oil and returned to consumers through income tax credits will be $47.
