New York 's Joffrey Ballet is often matchless for sheer glitter and sensuous invention . But virtuosity pursued for its own sake can be a vice , and showmanship pushed too far becomes a snare and a collusion . Of three new Joffrey offerings this spring , two , Confetti and Solarwind , are depressing cases in point . <P> Confetti , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , is , among other things , a " plaster bonbon . " The definition is cruelly apt as a description of Gerald Arpino 's creation , which turns three couples loose to the overture of Rossini 's Semiramide . Arpino 's brilliant passages of dance invention and his dancers ' great innovative skills leave the music behind . The ballet becomes a mere gymnastic feat . Solarwind is different-not a confection gone slickly sour but a modish sci-fi convention pursued without rhyme or reason . In a cosmic mood , Arpino sends his dancers blasting around the stage to assorted flatulent noises-pings , creaks and suckings . The score , by Avant-Garde Composer Jacob Druckman , is entitled Animus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said , used to take pepper just for the delight given by a freshwater chaser . Perhaps with a similar contrast in mind Jeffrey treats audiences to Pineapple Poll , a rarely seen romp created 19 years ago by John Cranko , now the director of the Stuttgart Ballet , to music of Sir Arthur Sullivan . Cheerful girls in peppermint stripes and ruffled panties collide with beerful British tars from H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun . Pineapple Poll herself appears and falls helplessly in love with Captain Belaye , an officer who combines the best qualities of Ralph Rackstraw , Captain Corcoran and Sir Joseph Porter , K.C.B. <P> Restaged for Joffrey by David Blair ( who danced the original Captain Belaye in London ) , the work produces unabashed delight in the mutiny , wholesale though ladylike transvestism , and twin marriages that follow , courtesy of W.S. Gilbert . As Poll , Charthel Arthur falls in love more energetically than anyone m recent memory . As dashing Captain Belaye , the man whose Apollonian suavity , superb condescension and sheer sexiness cause all the trouble , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One rude criterion for establishing a ballet 's worth is the impulse to dance that it stirs in an average member of the audience . By that standard , Cranko 's Poll must be judged a hopping success .
