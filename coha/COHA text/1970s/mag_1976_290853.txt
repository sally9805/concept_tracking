When Chile 's military government asked to play host to last week 's annual meeting in Santiago of the Organization of American States , the junta hoped the occasion might be a good chance to change its widespread image as the most repressive regime on the continent . No such luck . <P> At the opening session of the 23-nation conference , * Secretary of State Henry Kissinger walked to the podium in the steel-and-glass Diego Portales building and warned the junta that " the condition of human rights has impaired our relationship with Chile and will continue to do so . Human rights are the very essence of a meaningful life , and human dignity is the ultimate purpose of government . A government that tramples on the rights of its citizens denies the purpose of its existence . " It was by far the strongest statement on the subject that he had ever made anywhere , and it was greeted by stony silence . One delegate explained that the lack of applause applied to all speeches and was " traditional , " but the speech was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secretary 's statement was his carefully calculated response to the main topic of the meeting , a report on the hemisphere by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission detailing allegations of violations by 16 nations . The commission also filed a 191-page separate report on Chile and an 85-page brief against Cuba ( which was finished too late to be included on the agenda ) . The OAS charge against Chile cited numerous examples of people murdered , tortured and unlawfully arrested by the regime of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet . <P> If anything , the report on Cuba was even tougher ; it claimed that the Castro regime had set up a network of prison camps similar to Stalin 's infamous Gulag Archipelago . Kissinger in his speech observed that the report " confirmed our worst fears of Cuban behavior . " <P> Even discussing the human rights issue ( especially in Santiago ) was something of an innovation for the OAS-and for Kissinger . As one member of the American delegation put it , " Henry has come a hell of a long way on human rights in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about civic morality in Chile has coincided with strong signals from Congress that as far as the Pinochet regime is concerned , national security , economics and human rights are closely interrelated . Rejecting Administration requests , Congress has not only banned new military sales to Chile but has also cut aid from $70 million to about $30 million . Last week the Senate was prepared to vote down military assistance already in the pipeline-an act , the Secretary 's aides conceded , that would have made his visit to Santiago " extremely difficult . " <P> As it happened , the Chileans accepted Kissinger 's statement on human rights somewhat better than expected . The Secretary briefed Pinochet on the substance of his speech before it was delivered ; the Chilean strongman was apparently relieved that the text was not stronger .
