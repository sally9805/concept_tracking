A not-so-Communist manifesto hurts East-West relations <P> The signs of East Germany 's icy displeasure were unmistakable . Bound for East Berlin on a private visit , West German Christian Democratic Party Leader Helmut Kohl and three aides last weekend routinely handed over their passports at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint near the Berlin Wall ; there a squad of gray-coated Grenzpolizei , the Communist border guards , brusquely barred their way . Kohl had crossed the Wall several times in the past , but this time he was forced to wait at the checkpoint for an hour and then was told that his visit was " undesirable . " Although the Bonn government protested that the East German action was in violation of three treaties , border guards then prevented two other West German members of Parliament from entering the East . At the same time , many motorists seeking to drive into West Berlin via the East German Autobahn were being halted and subjected to searches by Communist police . The political forecast was for one of the sharpest freezes in relations between East and West Germany since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The trouble began earlier this month when the West German weekly Der Spiegel published a 30-page manifesto issued by a group of underground dissenters in East Germany who called themselves the League of Democratic Communists of Germany . The document denounced the Soviet Union for " brutal exploitation and suppression " of East Germany . With bitter sarcasm , the anonymous authors called their country " a pathetic imitation of a Soviet Republic whose worst features have been reinforced by German thoroughness . " Noting that Stalin had concentration camps even before Hitler , the manifesto charged that the " barbaric " Soviet system had since 1945 claimed " more victims in Eastern Europe than Hitler 's Nazism and World War II . " The manifesto called for the restoration of basic freedoms and the reunification of Germany , after the East has withdrawn from the Warsaw Pact and the West from NATO . <P> The manifesto also attacked corruption and greed in the government of Party Chief Erich Honecker . " These Politburo-crats are sick with conceit , " the document declared . " No ruling class in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling Communist families have , using our country like a self-service store . " Accused of living in " golden ghettos , " the leaders were said to have " enriched themselves shamelessly in special shops and by privately ordering goods from the West . " The worst offender was Honecker himself , who , the manifesto charged , had " stuffed the homes of his relatives from cellar to roof with the most modern Western conveniences " and obtained highly paid jobs for his wife and in-laws .
