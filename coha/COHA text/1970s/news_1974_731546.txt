txt NOBODY remembers Barney D 's full name . but the long-dead Civil War veteran has at least one thing in common with Richard Milhous Nixon . Both Barney D. and Richard M. were rescued by the stroke of a Presidential pen . Barney 's problem with the law started more than 100 years ago when he got drunk one night and tried to kill a fellow member of Mulligan 's Irish Guards . The soldier survived , but Barney was court-martialed and sentenced to die . As the story goes , minutes before the firing squad took aim one cold morning a horseman galloped into the Union army camp and handed the colonel a telegram . It read : " If you have not shot Barney D. ? yet  --  do n't . A. Lincoln . " MOST PARDONS in America 's history have n't been quite as dramatic as Barney 's . From George Washington 's day , Presidential reprieves have been issued routinely at an average of 200 a year for convicts dying in prison or long-reformed parolees who want a legal liquor , license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardons and reduced the sentences Jack Mabley 's column is on page 4. of 63 convicts , including labor leader Jimmy Hotta . And while there may never be an executive act of grace quite like President Ford 's decree almost two weeks ago , others have won headlines , a place in history , and more than a few enemies for the Presidents and governors who made them . Georgia 's Gov . Lamartine Hardman unwittingly fell into that category when he considered the cases of two notorious bootleggers more than 90 years ago . HARDMAN WAS a doctor whose hobby was phrenology  --  the untried and probably untrue theory that you can tell someone 's character by studying the bumps on his head . In 1929 , Hardman asked prison officials to bring the two gangsters into his office where he ceremoniously rubbed their scalps , declared them rehabilitated , and released them from the state penitentiary . The Hardman pardons created something of a fuss , but it was nothing like the storm over Leo Frank almost 15 years before . Georgia 's Gov . John M. Slaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not received a fair trial . The manager of a pencil factory , Frank had been convicted of the murder of one of his employees , Mary Phagan . There were a few things about the legal proceedings that bothered Slaton . For one thing , the jury had decided to convict Frank after listening for hours to a crowd outside the courtroom chanting , " Hang the Jew or we 'll hang you . " SO SLATON changed Frank 's sentence from death to life in prison and prepared to face the full anger of a mob that believed it had been robbed of its chance for vengeance . As soon as the news was out , Georgia 's Ku Klux Klan donned white satin robes and stormed the governor 's mansion to take Slaton 's life instead of Frank 's . Rebuffed by state police , they surged into an Atlanta jail cell where they swiftly vetoed Slaton 's pardon by dragging Frank out and lynching him . For years after , Georg ; anti-Semites haunted Slaton politically . he tried to run for the Senate a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years have realised that if you pardon somebody , the unwary voter thinks you somehow approved of what he did . Pardon an accused anarchist , as Illinois ' Gov . John P. Altgeld learned , and your enemies will call you an anarchist ; save a thief from the gallows and suddenly you are one . ILLINOIS GOV . Len Small , Republican , learned that political lesson in the 1920s when he pardoned 20 Chicagoans accused of being Communists . The decision came too late for three of the 20 , who died before Small issued his decree . Another had fled to Russia rather than take up residence in Joliet prison . Small said at the time that he thought the Communists ' ideas I which included such things as equal rights for women and sex edueation1 were " unwise " and " foolish . " But it did n't help much . The American Legion quickly called a meeting to censure him , and seine Illinois historians believe that Small 's politics were eyed suspiciously by staunch Republicans ever after . WARREN G. HARDING also infuriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his Presidential powers to release firebrand Socialist Eugene Debs from an Atlanta prison . Harding let Bobs out in time for Christmas of . 1921 , but the warm-hearted gesture had its political bite . He refused to give back the old radical 's right to vote . Historian Harry Barnard of Wilmette contends that sonic of the loudest cries of indignation over a pardon could be heard during the term of Illinois Gov . Altgeld . Allgeld , a Democrat , had watched like everybody else when eight anarchists were accused of murder during the Haymarket riots of 1886 . The ' eight were tried for murder and convicted on the theory , that whoever threw the bomb and killed a number of people had been inspired by their hot , radical speeches . FOUR OF THE anarchists were hanged , and a fifth committed suicide by biting a dynamite cap hours before he would have been escorted to the gallows . In June , 1893 , Altgeld cautiously pardoned the remaining three on the grounds that they did not have a fair trial , He avoided taik of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , such caution did n't make things any easier for - him . When election time came around , Altgeld was out . It took many years and several historical revisions before Ins Haymarket pardons were considered a blow for civil liberties in Illinois instead of an end to them . " MAYBE ONE lesson Alr . Ford should learn from all this is that it 's dangerous to pardon , " said Barnard , who has written extensively about Altgeld , Perhaps Ford , like other Presidents and governors , recognized that a thumbs-up in the political arena often does n't fare well with the fans . But Lincoln explained to a friend one time that something happens when a person suddenly has the power to be merciful . " You do not know how hard it is to have a human being die when you know that a stroke of your pen may save him , " he said after sending a slave-trader to death in 1892 . LINCOLN 'S confessed agony may explain why he probably pardoned more people than any President in our nation 's history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later  --  Gerald Ford  --  found It harder to watch Nixon face a court battle than for Ford himself to face a fight for his political future .
