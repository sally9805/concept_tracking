ANY AMERICAN WHO SUPPORTS the United L Nations , Colonel Robert McCormick used to tell his readers , must be " either a Communist or misinformed . " If misinformed , perhaps it was by the New York Post , which told its readers that the founding of the U.N . was " the greatest human gathering since the Last Supper . " The United Nations no longer arouses the old extremes of adulation or scorn . In fact , it arouses very little interest at all . Many Americans find General Assembly debates a turgid bore , the Security Council 's hand-wringing tragically irrelevant to most issues of peace and war . They long ago lost track of how many swamps have been drained , or children fed , or rice paddies planted , by the U.N . agencies . In Washington , the United Nations is so often praised in principle and ignored in practice that you hear it called the Better Business Bureau of world affairs . This month , however , the half-forgotten organization in Manhattan 's Turtle Bay enters one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-six-year history . Almost certainly by next year , and perhaps sooner , the U.N . will witness China 's formal debut as a great power in the world community . For two decades , the U.S. has invested an enormous political and emotional stake in keeping Peking out of the U.N . There is considerable worry in Washington and New York about what may happen once the bull is in the china shop ? or China , perhaps , is in the bull shop . Many expect the Chinese to carry on like raving , recalcitrant Maoists. using the U.N . primarily as a soapbox to attack " imperialism and its running dogs . " If so , this could not only bring U.N . business to a standstill , it could also undermine the organization 's U.S. support perhaps badly enough to revive the old political war cry of the Far Right : " Take the U.N . out of the U.S. , and the U.S. out of the U.N . " The sudden return of the U.N . to the forefront of U.S. concern also presents a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George H. W. Bush . His is the leading U.S. role as the General Assembly opens . A novice at the U.N. , Bush has no experience as a diplomat and no background in foreign affairs . In fact , he was not even considered for the U.N . until several weeks before his appointment ? when he himself suggested it to the White House . One of the most attractive and ambitious of the Republican " New Breed " Congressmen , Bush last November was feeling " totally crushed . " He had just lost a U.S. Senate race in Texas , and though he hoped to be named Secretary of the Treasury , the Administration was considering him for several lesser posts . The idea of the U.N . job was suggested to Bush by columnist Charles Bartlett and a few other Washington friends . " It would be a great personality showcase for you , " one of them recalls saying , " elbow to elbow with the top guys in the world . " Pleased with the idea , Bush sold it to President Nixon during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment a few days later , it seemed that the U.N . ambassadorship had become another of those political consolation prizes that Nixon habitually awards to Republican losers . Ah well , " good old George " could do no harm at the U.N. , and he had himself a prestigious if somewhat peripheral sinecure until the next election . Now , somewhat to his own surprise , Bush 's consolation prize has become the most difficult challenge of his career . What vastly complicates his major task at the U.N . this fall is the long U.S. tradition of diplomatic blackmail and political hysteria surrounding the question of the China seat . Like Nixon , Bush already knows something about that subject . In 1964 , running in his first Texas political campaign , the future U.N . ambassador firmly declared : " If Red China should be admitted to the United Nations , then the U.N . is hopeless , and we should withdraw . " That , of course , was a not uncommon comervative view at the time . Throughout the Fifties and Sixties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the most bizarre exercises in the annals of U.S. diplomacy . " I ca n't give you a figure in millions of dollars , " said a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. , " but we paid a good price . To vote against Peking , Country ' X ' would request a multimillion-dollar U.S. aid project . They 'd get it . Country ' Y ' would ask our help to obtain a crucial Secretariat job for the Foreign Minister 's incompetent cousin . They 'd get that too . " Knowledgeable U.S. diplomatic sources insist that even John Foster Dulles 's disastrous decision to withhold U.S. financing for the Aswan Dam was in some measure based on Cairo 's refusal to vote the American way on the China seat . Since China representation came up as many as a dozen times a year in various procedural votes , U.S. lobbying was virtually a year-round activity . During one agency meeting in Geneva , a senior U.S. diplomat was assigned to make midnight visits to the hotel rooms of sleepy European public health officials , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China-and the " People 's Republic of China . " In Manhattan , a junior foreign service officer would sheepishly search through cocktail lounges to round up delegates in time to vote against China . Sweetness and sugar PTIIHIS PAST SUMMER , AT LAST , the dramatic 1 announcement of Nixon 's " journey for peace " made a change in the China seat seem a question of when , not if . So it was a good time to listen to what the Chinese themselves were saying about U.N . membership , and a good place to do this was Ottawa . Red China established its first North American embassy there last February ? and Mao 's Long March to the United Nations began in earnest . By spring , they began receiving guests in their balconied penthouse at the rather posh Juliana Apartments , overlooking gothic Parliament Hill and the silver-steepled churches across the Ottawa River in Quebec . Canadian businessmen came to discuss trade , aides of U.S. Senators and journalists to seek visas . A half-dozen students from Columbia University dropped in to ask if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many meetings with sinologists from Canada and the U.S. Some of these conversations at the Juliana took place in a room furnished sparsely in Provincial style , with tasteful gold-weave upholstery and an Admiral color TV set . Fairly unobstrusive Mao portraits hung on the walls , along with a shell-relief of the Communist mecca of Yennan . Visitors were provided with white porcelain cups , which an official constantly refilled from a large metal teapot . Detailed reports on a half-dozen of the Juliana meetings offer an intriguing ? if highly tentative ? preview of what the Chinese may say and do at the U.N . Why , just six years after Premier Chou En-lai threatened to join Indonesia 's Sukarno in a rival " revolutionary U.N. , " does Peking now want in ? For one thing , say the Chinese , the Mao regime has always regarded U.N . membership as a " legitimate right " and deeply resented being blackballed from the club . As early as 1950 , Premier Chou was in touch with Trygve Lie and went so far as to announce publicly the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were never seated , and with the Korean war and the hardening of Maoism , the Chinese came to regard the U.N . as a vile instrument of its Western members . " If we should enter the United Nations , " said a confidential Work Bulletin of 1961 , " we would not be a majority . On the surface the situation would become easier , but in reality we should lose our freedom of movement . " Now Peking 's perception of the U.N . has changed . The new Afro-Asian majority , said the Ottawa Chinese , has given the U.N . " a different social consciousness " and Peking its first hon-est chance to compete in that forum against the two superpowers . The Chinese are candid about relating U.N . membership to their overriding foreign-policy interests : watching over , and outmaneuvering , " American imperialism , Soviet revisionism , and Japanese militarism , " and " ending the civil war " with the Nationalists . As the Chinese see it , Peking 's arrival at the U.N . will help convince Americans that Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . /A terms , how would the Peking delegates conduct themselves ? In the U.S. , views differ . As one sinologist with numerous State Department contacts remarked , " Washington seems to expect the Chinese to defecate on the Security Council 's carpets . " At best , most U.S. foreign-policy makers envision a Peking delegation resembling the obstreperous , veto-wielding Russians of the early 1950s . A different view prevails among many academics . Harvard 's John K. Fairbank , dean of . U.S. sinologists , thinks the Chinese are likely to spread " sweetness and sugar , rather than vinegar and dirty work . " The Chinese themselves suggested that there will be two touchstones for their U.N . debut . One is national dignity , including a very deliberate attempt to contrast themselves with Taiwan 's rather threadbare presence as a member of the Big Five . To take one example that might comfort the U.N . Secretariat , Peking could become one of the very few member governments faithfully to pay its assessed dues on time . The more important question is whether amour propre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . political issues . A second clue is that Ottawa visitors who referred to Peking as a " great power " were firmly corrected : the preferred usage at the Juliana is " middle power . " Undoubtedly , Peking 's first great goal would be to diminish the influence of the two superpowers at the U.N . and to emerge as leader of what Premier Chou has called a " broad , united front " of smaller nations . The Chinese even suggested a few of the first " united front " political issues at the U.N . The most critical is the Middle East . If Peking gained a seat on the Security Council , an all-out Chinese bid for militant Arab support could wreck the delicate negotiations of U.N . mediator Gunnar Jarring and the Big Four . Over the longer term , the Ottawa Chinese suggested that their strategy might include attempts to change U.N . procedural rules , and conceivably an eventual bid to move U.N . headquarters away from the ideologically " hostile " U.S. In the past decade . China 's public statements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic , social , and technological programs . In Ottawa , the Chinese mildly surprised one North American visitor by calling China " an underdeveloped country " with " many things to learn from you . " They appeared interested in joining multinational technological programs such as outer space and seismological monitoring , and do not exclude themselves from international efforts to control air hijacking , narcotics traffic ? and population growth . By contrast . the Chinese appeared to be wary of the U.N . ' s Third World economic-development programs . Presumably they do n't want to appear a debtor nation , coming bowl in hand to the U.N . for largely Western-financed assistance . Comic operetta A IF THE CHINA QUESTION were n't enough , the new U.N . Assembly session opens at a time of many other challenges and woes . For one thing . the U.N . is searching for a successor to U Thant , who is both tired and ailing . In recent months , the sixty-two-year-old Secretary General suffered several spells of dizziness and " extreme fatigue , " and announced that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now " irrevocable . " Under Thant. institutional confusion has become so severe that the U.N. , in the words of Canada 's External Affairs Minister , " is drowning in a sea of words . " In one recent twelvemonth period , the U.N . system printed 739.507,676 pages of speeches and documents and held a total of 6,717 meetings . Also , the U.N . is seriously hobbled by an arteriosclerotic leadership . Most senior Secretariat officials are in their sixties and seventies , and some are badly out of touch . The U.N . must deal with even more fundamental troubles . To many veteran observers , its standing has never seemed quite so low with quite so many of its members . The French , though more polite than under De Gaulle , think of the U.N . in le grand Charles ' cutting phrase . " les nations dues unies " ( the so-called United Nations ) . In Israel , young people call the U.N . " United Nothing " ; one ambassador described it as " comic operetta in a Tower of Babel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could revitalize its role in the 1970s by attempting to deal with the global challenge of ecology . With encouragement from the U.S. and other industrialized countries , the U.N . is preparing an ambitious draft program to protect the earth 's environment and resources . Whether this is more than an empty gesture will begin to become apparent next June , when the first U.N . Conference on the Human Environment opens at the Royal Opera in Stockholm . The Stockholm conference is already controversial . One U.N . ambassador , repeating a frequent criticism , accuses Nixon of " trying to turn the U.N . into a technological training institute " ? that is , of using " nonpolitical " issues such as environment to deflect the U.N . from its proper " political " role . Actually , an adequate program to control pollution would be highly " political , " intruding on national interests and sovereignty to a greater extent than has any other United Nations activity . But that simply is n't going to happen unless support can be enlisted from most of the U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution as a rich man 's ailment , competing for funds against their own immediate problems of poverty and underdevelopment . One way to gain Third World support for environmental programs has been suggested by President Nixon , an aficionado of " trade-offs " in foreign affairs . He has proposed to the U.N . that the U.S. and other coastal states renounce national claims to mineral and other seabed resources beyond the depth of 200 meters ( 0.12 miles ) . A new international authority would protect the seabeds from pollution and license exploitation . The authority 's potentially vast revenues would be spent " for international purposes . particularly the development of the poorer nations . " In the 1970s , the U.N . ' s role in Third World development is likely to be more crucial than ever before . The U.S. Congress and public are growing increasingly impatient with high-profile bilateral giving that can commit the U.S. willy-nilly to help maintain the stability of unsavory " client " regimes . To overcome these valid objections , the Administration has proposed shifting most bilateral aid funds to multilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals could offer a challenging agenda for the Seventies , whatever did happen to the more classically political U.N. ? the " last , best hope " for world peace ? In the Middle East ? or anywhere else ? no new U.N . peace-keeping operation is likely to be undertaken without detailed U.S.-Soviet advance agreement on how to conduct , finance , and control it . A crown prince D URING A TIME OF TRANSITION at Turtle Bay , a significant change has also taken place within the U.S. Mission . As the late Adlai Steven-son 's public-affairs assistant once remarked , America 's U.N . ambassadors ? Henry Cabot Lodge , Stevenson , Arthur Goldberg ? usually have been appointed under " the star system . " In political terms . Ambassador George Bush is more of an unknown ingenue . Except for a few interim appointees , he is the first U.S. ambassador who is neither a mature politician of national stature nor an accomplished professional diplomat . But Bush is easy to underrate . At forty-seven , he has the public-spirited dedication , social graces , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with the earned achievements of an oil millionaire and Republican vote getter in the Democratic state of Texas . Bush is also intelligent , handsome , compassionate . and endlessly energetic , all of which has made him something of a golden boy to Richard Nixon . During the wilderness years , Nixon developed a notable talent for identifying - and cataloguing hot new political properties . In Bush , a freshman Congressman from Houston , the President detected " a unique charisma . " Bush 's name popped up in Nixon 's overnight meeting to choose a Republican Vice Presidential nominee at Miami Beach in 1968 . Barring debacle at the U.N. , it may well come up again next August at San Diego . By the standards of the U.N . ' s strongest American supporters ? who are liberal , avidly internationalist , and more often than not Democratic ? much of Bush 's political record is dismal . His votes in Congress were a shade less conservative than his speeches on the hustings . But when last heard from on domestic subjects , Bush was still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plans for the schools . During the mid-1960s , he enthusiastically campaigned for higher tariffs and lower foreign-aid appropriations. against East-West trade and the nuclear test-ban treaty . Bush likes to portray his political conservatism as an ambassadorial asset . East Coast liberals have " clutched the U.N . to their breasts and smothered it , " he says , and it needs to be resold to - people like me , plain Middle Americans . " In fact , he is not a plain Middle American . Raised in Greenwich , Connecticut , in a fifteen-room house with three servants , George Herbert Walker Bush was born into what some are pleased to call the New England Plantation Class . His father , Prescott Bush , was managing partner of the international banking house of Brown Bros. , Harriman ; member of the Yale Corporation ; and . from 1952 to 1962 , U.S. Senator from Connecticut . At Burning Tree Golf Club and the winter watering hole of Hobe Sound , Florida , " Pres " Bush was the frequent golfing partner and host of virtually the whole Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That George often joined his father 's golf foursomes ? once against the curious pair of J. William Fulbright and Robert A. Taft ? has hardly harmed his political fortunes . Bush 's maternal family , the Walkers ( who enclawed golf 's Walker Cup ) , are no liability to him either . When Bush became one of the first West Texas oilmen to go public , his major New York underwriter was G. H. Walker &; Co. , a blue-chip brokerage house headed by his uncle and namesake , George Herbert Walker . That Uncle - Herbie " is also part owner of baseball 's New York Mets conceivably helps explain why this spring , for the first time , the new U.N . Ambassador , and not the Mayor of New York City , threw out the season 's first ball . John V. Lindsay 's staff was livid . Prescott Bush recalls teaching George " the family feeling that public service is a wonderful activity , and those who are most fortunate have the greatest obligation to serve . " After graduating from Andover in 1942 , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won his wings he was the Navy 's youngest pilot , and was the only survivor picked up by a U.S. submarine when his three-man Grumman Avenger was shot down in 191/1- near a Japanese-held island . Bush married Barbara Pierce , daughter of the president of the McCall Publishing Company , and enrolled at Yale after the war . " Poppy , " as he was then known , was captain of the varsity baseball team , member of Skull and Bones , and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in economics . A former chairman of the Yale Daily News remembers Bush as " a crown prince of the ' Greenwich Conspiracy , ' which ran Yale . They were all dedicated , earnest , encrusted with tradition ? the essence of white-shoed Yale do-goodism . " After Yale , Bush 's New England public-service strain turned into Texas boosterism . He moved " way the hell away " to the booming West Texas oiltown of Midland , he says , " because I did n't want to live in the suburbs and be Tres Bush 's boy . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get ? an oilfield administrative outpost plagued by sandstorms in spring and 110-degree heat in summer . As the town grew , Bush was a founder or fund raiser for nearly everything in sight ? the cancer drive , the first YMCA , the new bank , a Little Theater . When he first arrived , he worked as a $375-a-month executive trainee and oilfield supply salesman . George and Barbara lived among the field hands on East 7th Street . Neighbors ' pigs and chickens roamed underfoot , and the other half of their frame house was occupied by a hard-working prostitute . In 1954 , Bush and his partner , J. Hugh Leidtke , formed Zapata Off-Shore Company , named after the Marlon Brando movie . With Bush as president , the company became one of WHEN BUSH SOLD his oil interests to run for Congress in 1966 , he was a millionaire and , he says , " no longer interested in piling up money or things . I wanted something else to do . " He had moved with Zapata to Houston and , between serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had become one of the state Republican party 's most successful fund raisers . Despite some muttering that Bush was only a " country club Republican , " he was chosen GOP county chairman in 1963 and won the party 's nomination the next year for the U.S. Senate . Though Bush lost to incumbent Ralph Yarborough , he polled enough votes to make him the best statewide Republican vote getter in Texas history . In 1966 , he was rated as one of the most attractive new Republican faces in the South when he won a Congressional seat in Houston 's highly conservative , largely upper-middle class Seventh District . The Bush TV spots that deluged Houston showed a vigorous young man jacket slung over his shoulder , tie blowing in the wind ? pounding the pavements and looking concerned . Occasionally , Bush 's catchy campaign tune of 76 Trombones faded , and a voter would ask Bush whether he was a conservative or liberal . " Labels are for cans , " he would reply , " not for people . " Bush still uses that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created for him by a total newcomer to politics named Harry Treleaven , whom Bush recruited from Madison Avenue 's J. Walter Thompson agency to run his campaign advertising . Today , Treleaven has an office a half-dozen blocks from the White House with Jim Allison , Bush 's close friend and 1966 campaign manager . They run campaigns for some of the country 's most prominent Republicans , and Allison is also deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee . " The fact that I 'm in politics at all , " says Treleaven , " is due to George . " *After the 1966 campaign , Treleaven wrote a report on Bush 's race that he called UPSET : The Story of a Modern Political Campaign . One of seven Xeroxed copies was shown to Nixon 's law partner and campaign recruiter , Leonard Garinent , who hired Treleaven as Nixon 's creative director of advertising . Of Bush 's four years on Capitol Hill , one veteran Democrat says . " Around here we have craftsmen like Wilbur Mills , and we have operators like Rayburn or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new man , a damn shrewd one . " Bush was one of three freshmen in this century assigned a seat on the House Ways and Means Committee . Chairman Wilbur Mills , a Democrat , rated him " one of the very ablest members . " He was also Ways and Means ' most knowledgeable spokesman for the oil industry . Bush was quite an operator socially as well . It is difficult to imagine any other House freshman who could throw monthly dinner parties where a fairly typical guest list included : three ranking members of the Nixon Administration , two European ambassadors , one U.S. Supreme Court Justice , astronaut Neil Armstrong , and the director of the CIA . Interestingly enough ? and the racial record of America 's ambassador to the U.N . is always of wide interest ? the only rough political controversy Bush faced in his district concerned one of his votes on civil rights . In 1968 , the Johnson Administration 's bitterly debated open-housing bill passed the House . Bush voted for it . That Bush 's vote took considerable courage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it in a letter he wrote to a close friend while flying back to Washington after confronting his angry constituents . The letter also recounts an incident on the plane that captures the peculiar intensity of Bush 's commitment as a politician . ... I never dreamed the reaction would be so violent . Seething hatred ? the epithets ? the real chicken shit stuff in . spades ? to our office girls : " You must be a nigger or a Chinaman " ? and on and on ? and the county crowd disowning me and denouncing me and wondering if they could " still continue to support me " ? and at the Gridiron Dinner the snubs by legislative candidates who were wanting my support and fawning all over me a couple of months ago . . . . Tonight I got on this plane and this older lady came up to me . She said , " I 'm a. conservative Democrat from the district , but I 'm proud , and will always vote for you now " ? and her accent was Texan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would all be OK ? and I started to cry ? with the poor lady embarrassed to death-1 could n't say a word to her . .. . When Bush ran for the U.S. Senate last year against Democrat Lloyd Bentsen , friends wrote down his decision to arm-twisting by Nixon . Very little twisting was needed . Says Bush , " I want to score and then be captain , to get promoted and then be boss , to get elected and achieve something and then to get elected to something else . " White House clout HUSH 'S BACKGROUND in Congressional politics 1-10 is probably his most important asset for the United Nations . Much U.N . business revolves around the legislative-style lobbying that Dean Rusk called " parliamentary diplomacy . " Bush calls it " harvesting the votes , " and he obviously knows where the votes are . His very first social engagement after his U.N . appointment was a Washington cocktail party he threw for African ambassadors . The Africans , who were delighted , are by far the largest voting bloc in the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . Nixon 's first U.N . ambassador , career diplomat Charles W. Yost , had little clout with the White House . Yost left his U.N . post convinced that being a professional diplomat was " a distinct handicap . " Of his own relationship with the President . Bush says : " We 're not ' Dick ' and ' George . ' I do n't intend to big-deal-it every day on the White House hot line . " Nevertheless , Bush 's way of operating has already given the U.S. Mission a warm feeling that " New York " swings more weight in Washington . Last spring , Bush was scheduled to appear on Meet the Press during a delicate pass in the Middle East negotiations . Assistant Secretary of State Joseph Sisco asked him to cancel : he was new in the job and might say the wrong thing . According to Mission sources , Bush 's reply was : well , the White House wants me to get out and do these interview shows , so maybe the White House had better call me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing undiplomatic ) . Bush made his weight felt in Washington on another occasion that surprised a few of his political friends . By all accounts , Bush is a remarkably compassionate and thoughtful man , " far more sensitive , " says White House Counselor Robert Finch , " than most of our breed . " A prominent Texas Democrat says , " This kind and very attractive side of Bush is his greatest asset , and worst political liability . He lacks a necessary hardness . " The first U.N . test of that proposition came last summer when the White House wanted to appoint sixty-six-year-old Arthur Flemming , a retread from the Eisenhower Cabinet , as ambassador to the U.N . Economic and Social Council . ECOSOC badly needs vigorous U.S. representa tion . Bush vetoed the appointment , which was particularly difficult because Flemming 's son , White House aide Harry Flemming , is a friend . ECOSOC would probably be stuck with Flemming Sr. if Bush were a total cream puff ? or , perhaps , a career diplomat . The most important question mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as he puts it , for the often complex diplomatic negotiations at the Security Council and among the Big Four . But already , he has the U.S. Mission humming as it has n't in years , and has overcome a lot of initial skepticism about his appointment . It was a patently political one , and Bush wryly observed , " I did n't exactly expect the Council on Foreign Relations to take me out to lunch . " Though Bush is witty and urbane in small groups , he sometimes comes on in larger ones as though he would n't know what the Council on Foreign Relations was if it did take him out to lunch . Part of the reason is what a colleague calls " George 's Sioux City speech . " He has a Texas politician 's frenetic platform manner , and when he started at the U.N. , he confronted a vast new subject with little detailed knowledge of it . The frequent result was arm-flailing , podium-pounding , intensely dramatic speeches saying almost nothing about almost everything the U.N . has ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . " S INCE BUSH avidly delivered his Sioux City speech last summer everywhere from California to Dallas to the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce , his " aw , shucks " manner doubtless has a political method to it . As he frankly explains , " The fundamental importance of being in elected politics remains a priority for me . " But Bush has also never given less than his best to a job . To him , the U.N . is " like a losing ball club . It needs some big wins , and I 'm determined to do everything I can to see that it gets them , " Bush is probably in a better position to do so than a modest professional diplomat would be . The Administration 's development-assistance and environmental proposals could be politically important to the U.N . ' s unsettled future ? particularly now that the Chinese are not discouraging the hope that their 800 million people might soon be participating in some of them . At such a time , the interests of the Administration ? and the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , hell , " says a ranking State Department official , " Bush is a politician on the make . And maybe that 's exactly what the U.N . needs right now . "
