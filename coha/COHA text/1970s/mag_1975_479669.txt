would merely complete the business left unfinished at Yalta and so prepare for a great peace conference like that at Paris in 1919 . This expectation was not fulfilled . The agreements made at Yalta were challenged and repudiated . Issues long settled were reopened . By the end of the meeting the Allied unity of the second world war had been disrupted . The great peace conference was never held . Instead the way was opened for the Cold War The failure of the Potsdam meeting was a bitter moment in the history of mankind . The glittering prospects that had offered themselves as the war drew to a close were jettisoned for a generation . What went wrong ? Many writers have mulled over the Potsdam record , most of them eager to pin the guilt on the statesman of some rival power , a few of them to pin it on their own . The writing of history has itself become part of the Cold War . Americans , loyally followed by the British , have accused Soviet Russia of seeking to promote international Communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish economic control of the entire world under the guise of liberal democracy . C " ' ARLES MEE , the latest investigaVol tor , maneuvers to evade the problem by blaming everybody . The three leaders , it seems , deliberately set out to quarrel . " They perceived that they could enhance their power more certainly in a world of discord than of tranquility . " Therefore " they took the stuff of historical forces , of natural international conflict , of differA . J. P. Taylor , the British historian , is the author , most recently , of Beaverbrook ( Simon and Schuster ) . ing political and economic needs , and shaped them into the stuff of casus belli . " At the end of the book Mee quotes Lyndon Johnson as saying that war , whether hot or cold , is what enables a President to assume the maximum of power : " Roosevelt was never President . . . until the war came along . " Similarly Truman was never President until he had his war , and the same presumably applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If he did not succeed in bringing America to the rescue of the British Empire , he did succeed in stirring up and exacerbating suspicion and antagonism between America and Russia . " The final sentence of the prologue reads : " How the three leaders rescued discord from the threatening outbreak of peace is the story of this book . " We must take Charles Mee at his word and accept that this was the book he intended to write . He has not done so . After his introductory dogmatizing , giving away the solution of the mystery in advance , he sits back and lets the story tell itself . His book is an exercise in the fashionable art of instant history , in which every episode is hotted up with an anecdote . Those who like I-wasthere books will like this one . We learn the color of Truman 's bow tie and the cut of his suit . Churchill calls , not surprisingly , for whisky . Stalin appears , more surprisingly , smoking a cigar . Even on this basis the treatment is uneven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of anecdotes . Indeed , there are enough anecdotes to be spread over all the Americans present at Potsdam ? or even those absent . Churchill appears as an old ham actor who can no longer remember his lines , and the anecdotes about him are taken from such questionable sources as 95 Cadogan 's diaries . On Attlee Charles Mee is just plain wrong . He thinks Attlee was somehow lower class when he was in fact high professional middle class with a public-school education . Stalin is treated as not much better than a monster . This is not surprising when the only source used for him is a book by an anti-Bolshe. vik , Adam Ulam . ( Of course , this is largely Stalin 's own fault for not allowing Russians to write books of anecdote about him . ) No other Russian gets a look insofar as anecdotes go , and perhaps Molotov does not deserve any . Certainly you can have lots of fun with history as anecdote , particularly when treating international conferences . The Congress of Vienna has been a fertile source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , with Tsar Alexander I and Metternich sharing a mistress , to Castlereagh 's annoyance . We can read about 13ismarck stuffing shrimps into his mouth with one hand and cherries with the other at the Congress of Berlin . The Paris peace conference has hardly yet emerged from the flood of anecdotes surrounding it . Such treatment does not make us any wiser . A verbatim report of any discussion between a few men can he made to sound pretty silly with the interruptions and misunderstandings , the asides and the bad jokes that no sane man would laugh at . International conferences are not alone in this . We would get the same effect from company directors at a meeting or university professors at a faculty board . Yet such proceedings normally produce useful results which have rational explanations . The anecdotes get us nowhere . DAD AS IT MAY BE for budding au- thors , the truth is that history does not write itself , any more than a block of stone turns itself into a statue without a sculptor to hack it about . The historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background , shape it into a pattern , and so produce an interpretation that makes sense . Charles Mee certainly imposed a pattern at the outset , as I have already described , though he does not bother much about it thereafter . His pattern is , in my opinion , far too rigid and indeed totally wrong . Did the three men at Potsdam really set out to wreck the proceedings and so promote a state of international tension ? Truman may have been less adroit than Roosevelt . He was certainly less inclined to he conciliatory toward Stalin and had been avowedly anti-Bolshevik as late as the outbreak of the Sovict-German war , when he proposed that German . and Russians should be left to cut each others ' throats . That is a long way from saying that he was a deliberate wrecker . Churchill , too , had been an anti-Bolshevik in his day , but he later stayed in public life when he was already a dying man in the hope of promoting good relations between Soviet Russia and the West . As to Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of one to enhance his power , which was already absolute . With 20 million Russian dead ? a fact never referred to by Mee ? Stalin had surely had enough great wars to last his lifetime . The Potsdam meeting , like all other historical events , was a product of circumstances . The circumstances had changed since Yalta , and the spirit of the meeting changed with them . The overriding change was that Germany had been defeated . At the time of the Yalta meeting the three powers desperately needed each other and therefore had to agree . At Potsdam they needed each other much less . Even in regard to Japan , the Americans did not need Great Britain and could not decide whether they needed Soviet Russia in the Far East or wanted to keep her out . Germany was still a problem , but one that had changed its nature . The Russians still wanted security against a renewed German aggression , a desire that Mee , like Truman and Churchill before him , hardly grasps . This desire was not surprising after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal a sinister plan to dominate Europe or even part of it . The Americans , on the other hand , were anxious to be quit of Europe and were much more concerned with how much the occupation of Germany would cost them than with prolonging it . The key to Potsdam was mutual misunderstanding , not mutual rivalry or hostility . There was a deeper background to the Potsdam meeting which again Mee does not mention . Potsdam did not merely come after a great war . It came after twenty years when Soviet Russia had been excluded from international affairs . The Cold War did not start in 1945 . It started in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution . The second world war had been an interruption in Soviet Russia 's isolation and a very disagreeable one . Once the war was over all those concerned slipped back without thinking into their old attitudes . But not quite . The Russians having become unmistakably a power of the first rank , expected to be treated as equals . The British and Americans simply could not believe it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a say in regard to the government of Poland and for that matter in regard to the governments of Bulgaria , Hungary , and Romania as well . They were bewildered when the Russians demanded a say in regard to the governments of Italy or France . The British and Americans held military sway in the Mediterranean , as they still rather ineffectively do . Yet they were outraged when the Russians proposed to play a part in the Mediterranean . Here , it seemed to them , was the proof of Soviet imperialism and aggression . Suspicion of Russia was a self-fulfilling prophecy . Once the Western powers refused to treat Soviet Russia as an equal , they found reasons for suspicion in her every move . No doubt the Russians made a similar self-fulfilling prophecy on their side . The Americans also came to the conference table after a long period of Splendid Isolation . When England had been in this position , she was known as perfidious Albion , and Lord Salisbury , the foreign secretary , said arrogantly : " England does not seek alliances ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had graciously rescued the quarrelsome Europeans without incurring any obligation on their side . Woodrow Wilson claimed to be above the battle at the Paris peace conference . Truman repudiated many of Roosevelt 's bargains . He refused Great Britain the share in nuclear secrets that Roosevelt had promised Churchill in 1943 . He repeatedly treated the Yalta agreements ? for instance , over reparations ? as of no account . He told Stalin he was eager for a peace conference , while holding in his hand a note that it was in America 's interest never to hold one . This was not a deception peculiar to Tim-man . It was the normal behavior of a great power which no longer needs to conciliate others . CHARLES MEE does not provide any of this background . He does not even provide much foreground . In the few instances when he does so he gets it wrong . For instance , he says that at Yalta it was agreed that the two Polish governments ? the exiled government in London and the Soviet-inspired Lublin government ? should be amalgamated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganized with the addition of " democratic and anti-Fascist elements " from within Poland and abroad ? a definition that excluded the London Poles , who were neither democratic nor anti-Fascist . But then Charles Mee never explains who were the London or the Lublin Poles or what were the underlying causes of the dispute . Stalin wanted a Poland friendly to Russia ; the two Western powers wanted free elections in Poland ; the two aims could not be reconciled . Similarly , what was at stake in the argument over Poland 's frontier on the Western Neisse ? It is like following a move-by-move account of some board game , when we are never told whether the game is chess , checkers , or backgammon . Into this confused melee there intrudes the great issue of the atomic bomb . Charles Mee does it full justice . We get the sensational reports from the testing ground . We hear Stimson 's warnings and hesitations . Truman rejoices that he now has a new weapon which strengthens his hand against Soviet Russia . By the book 's end Charles Mee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb was dropped on Japan for the effect it had on Russia . " This is pressing things far too hard . The dropping of the atomic bomb has been deeply investigated . It is one of the few problems to which we know the answer . Japan was approaching defeat but was not yet willing to surrender . Some American authorities , including Eisenhower and MacArthur , thought she could be pushed into this without using the bomb , but they recognized that fighting lay ahead . The bomb seemed the quickest way of ending the war . Even so , the Japanese held out after the first bomb had been dropped . It was only the second bomb on Nagasaki that drove the emperor of Japan to insist on surrender . Until the last minute it was touch and go . The prime motive in dropping the two atomic bombs was to end the war . A second motive was the desire of the scientists to justify the vast expenditure on nuclear research . The warning to Russia was an uncovenanted benefit that came a long way behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen the most dramatic , though not the truest , version of what happened . No one would dispute that the Potsdam meeting was the prelude to the Cold War . This is very far from saying that any of the participants deliberately set out to provoke the Cold War or foresaw its coming . Moreover , the consequences were not all disastrous . Of course , the ideal outcome would have been for the three great Allies of the second world war to live forever in amity and cooperation . But this was not on offer . The Allies had been forced together by common dangers . Once these were removed , their cooperation ended . Short of One World presided over by three benevolent powers , partition was the best solution . This is what happened : Germany was divided . Soviet Russia had her zone of security in Eastern Europe . The United States had its zone of security in Western Europe . The nuclear weapons of Soviet Russia and the United States have canceled out . This has been expensive and occasionally alarming . But it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of unparalleled prosperity . That is not something to be sneezed at . One can add a more cynical note . If the Potsdam meeting had succeeded , it would have riveted the dictatorship of the three great powers on the rest of the world for good and all . As it was , the peoples who are slightingly called backward , undeveloped , or ? not being pink-colored ( white ? ? uncivilized , have been able to get out of hand . Failure at Potsdam was bad news for the British , the Americans , and the Russians . It has brought good news for the Chinese , the Africans , and the Arabs . Maybe Potsdam was the first step toward the end of white supremacy . Potsdam is a great theme and demands a great historian . No one less than Thucydides could do it justice . Charles Mee is no Thucydides . He a lively narrator who can draw anec dotes out of a hat and reduce the greatest issues to trivialities . As en tertainment his book is highly sue cessful . As serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
