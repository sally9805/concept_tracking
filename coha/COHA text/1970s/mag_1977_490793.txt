THE TALK OF THE TOWN the Man ' label . While he notes that he 's not a designer himself , the fashion industry generally credits him with helping popularize the three-piece vested suit , reflecting his own specific tastes in clothing . " Not only is Telly not a designer but in this picture he is looking at his bolt of cloth as though it were about to unfold an unpleasant surprise , like a dishonorable discharge . Yet if Telly pretends to no experience in the matter of clothing , he could hardly deny that he has access to an enormous reality catch basin . Telly has accumulated an enormous reality fortune on television . He has gathered reality to himself by appearing on a " Celebrity Roast , " by appearing on talk programs , and ( most important ) by appearing week after week as Kojak , the policeman who takes no backchat . Telly has so much reality that recently he was very nearly able to rescue a live Evel Knievel special on which Evel Knievel ( after an accident ) was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of a man named Orval , who exploded a chair he was sitting in , and the help of Jill St. John ( " You know , Orval told me he 's lost fifty per cent of his hearing doing this , " Miss St. John said ) and of several others , but it was Telly who supplied the reality . Not long ago , drawn by Telly 's reality , we attended the inaugural presentation of the Telly Apparel for the Man line of clothing . The premiere of the Telly-inspired wardrobe was held at the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf-Astoria , a room that lost its reality some time ago and had to be recast as a Venetian biscuit box . There was a stage covered in blue carpeting , and there was a podium constructed of that interesting wood-grained material that the manufacturers of inexpensive Oriental sound systems use . The audience included buyers and retailers . The presentation was a Total Experience , in the sense that there were models , three screens  --  one large and central , two small and flanking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the show began , the left-hand flanking screen showed the name " Telly " and the right-hand flanking screen showed the phrase " The Man , " while the large central screen showed different Views of Telly the Man . Then all three screens showed views of Telly the Man . Telly was shown with Mike Douglas and with the Queen of England on the flanking screens . ( Later , on the central screen , he was shown with Sammy Davis , Jr. , and Lucille Ball . ) " People like Telly because they know that Telly- likes people , " a Voice said . Then the left-hand screen showed the name " Telly " while the right-hand screen showed the word " Appeal . " " Now the Telly appeal can work for you , " the Voice said . After a while , some models came out in some clothes . The clothes were in the " Kojak " manner . The models danced , in a way , to the discothque music . Then the screens came on again , and the Voice told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and how many people read about Telly in " print " ( not nearly so many ) , and how Telly was sure to attract people to any store displaying the Telly Apparel for the Man line of Telly-inspired fashions . On the left screen came the name " Telly . " On the right came the phrase " The Brand . " The Voice grew very warm and very insistent in its discussion of the Telly brand . " Telly fashions for the man are real , because Telly would n't have them any other way , " the Voice said . " Telly 's not a model or a designer , but your customers are not models or designers , either . " The Voice seemed to imply that Telly , who had supplied the crucial reality to his line of fashions , had had it up to here with models and designers , who , after all , are known to he people of limited appeal , excessively preoccupied with clothes . ANOTHER genre of endorsement we have studied lately involves the authority inherent in Pretty People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial way . Pretty People were used to decorate or to entice or , sometimes , to convince , but , since they were frequently identified with the concept of Good Taste , they were usually not allowed to raise their voice . In perfume advertisements , for instance , Pretty People have only rarely been allowed to speak at all . Recently , however , there has emerged an interest in strip-mining the authority inherent in Pretty People , and there is now in Grand Central Terminal an articulate little display set up in an articulate little glass booth ( which we like to think of as an articulate little museum ) , and this display shows the new technique at work . The display consists of important advertisements for one of the Salem family of cigarettes , which , more than any other advertisements , have given voice to the new , more assertive Pretty Person . Some of the Pretty People on display are men , some are women , some are black , one speaks a sort of Spanish , but all of them sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear expensive shirts with at least two buttons open at the top . All these Pretty People are at home in Sausalito and Aspen ; all of them look the viewer straight in the eye . All of them are in touch with their bodies . These Pretty People have seen the sixties close up , and from time to time take a meal that is all wine and cheese . They spend more money on their soft , shiny hair in one week than a Portuguese peasant earns in a year . Most important , they smoke one of the Salem family of cigarettes and would rather button their shirts right up to the top than stop smoking Salems . " If I 'm smoking it , you know I 'm enjoying it , " a black man says , in a caption . " Incredible , " exclaims a formidable girl with hair so long and lustrous it makes you weep with pleasure . " Some people smoke and do n't enjoy it . " A girl with brown hair ( and crossed legs and an expensive shirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some people . " We all smoke for enjoyment . Remember ? " she asks . How low one feels not to remember that . But the Pretty Person one is most reluctant to face is the authoritarian man with becoming gray hair who asks " How come I enjoy smoking and you don'tP " We 've tried to be tough hack to this guy . " How come we enjoy Pointillism and you do n't ? " we have murmured to him . " How come we enjoy the sprung rhythm of Gerard Manley Hopkins and you do n't ? How come we enjoy The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas ' and you ca n't spell your stupid name ? " But nothing wipes the smug smoker 's smile off his face . ? Extensions Downtown WP.A. : In a number of places be- low Fourteenth Street , certain aesthetics ( old and only partly occupied ) have been claimed and inhabited by people who have an interest in their surfaces . The aesthetics involved have been extended to encompass ideas they had not encompassed before . At W.P.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Deal has been extended to encompass the idea of luxury . Harry Gottlieb , David Margolis , Augustus Goertz , and Sarah Berman Beach were there the other day , sitting around a table with a black tablecloth . Sarah Beach looked at the murals at V.P.A.N Some of these murals showed muscular men at work ; others showed dancers in a night-club setting . Sarah Beach , who had worked on the W.P.A. mural project during the Depression , ignored the night-club scene but nodded politely toward the muscular men . " That looks a little like the W.P.A. , " she said . " Well , " said Harry Gottlieb , who did lithographs and silk-screen prints for the W.P.A. during the Depression , " it 's what you call saloon art . " " Remember , we all used to go to that bar , George 's ? " Augustus Goertz , who had also been a W.P.A. artist , L Tow said . " At Seventh Avenue and Bleecker ? There were some murals there with a kind of Egyptian quality . I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kavkaz , on Fourteenth Street , " Sarah Beach said . " That was n't a bar , " Mr. Goertz said . " No , but you could get a meal for sixty-five cents , with seven-layer cake for dessert , " Sarah Beach said . Now there was music at W.P.A. A tape played first " I 've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm , " then " Thou Swell . " Two of the proprietors of the restaurant  --  Stephen Chambers , who is a real-estate broker with Douglas-Elliman-Hollyday &; Ives , and Ron Doud , who is an interior designer for fashionable stores  --  sat down at the table . " Did you paint these murals yourself ? " Harry Gottlieb asked . Ron Doud said that the murals had been designed by George Stavrinos , an artist who often has work in the Times Magazine and Book Review , and executed by one of the painters at Artkraft Strauss who did the " King Kong " poster in Times Square . " Mmm , " Harry Gottlieb said . " When we opened here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surroundings  --  the industrial buildings , " said Mr. Doud . " The real W.P.A. must have been incredible , " said Mr. Chambers . " Would you like to hear what I contributed to the W.P.A. from 1934 to Pearl Harbor ? " David Margolis , a W.P.A. muralist , asked . " First , I did a mural of the history of costume for the Strauhenmuller Textile High School , on West Eighteenth Street . That 's still there . Then I did a mural on the history of music for the music room at Samuel j . Tilden High School . That mural was destroyed . ' Then for three and a half years I worked on a big mural for the administration building at Bellevue Hospital ? The Evolution of Man in an Industrial Age . ' I showed modern agriculture and modern recreation and modern medicine . The central panel had the theme of the citizen-family in the industrial age . It was very , very large . My largest work . It was done in fresco secco . I worked on it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Second World War . It 's still there , but painted over . I had another sketch approved , to paint another section of Bellevue , but then it was Pearl Harbor . Still , I did n't stop working . They requested me to teach camouflage up in Harlem to black Army recruits . It was recognized that I was radical , so I was assigned to teach in Harlem . I got twenty-seven fifty a week . I got altogether maybe ? eighty-five hundred dollars for all those years of work . " " And you were getting paid as a supervisor , " Augustus Goertz said " The regular artist got only twenty-three eighty-six a week . " " I wonder if we should tell about the job march on - Washington , " Sarah Beach asked . " Not all of us were involved in that , " Harry Gottlieb said . " We should talk about the sit-in . I was president of the Artists Union in 1936 . We were a very militant organization . We fought like hell to stop layoffs of artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in . This may have been the first sit-in in New York City . It was at the W.P.A. Regional Director 's office , on King Street . Two hundred and nineteen artists sat in . " " Harry stayed at the union offices , on Eighteenth Street , " Augustus Goertz said . " They told me , ' Someone has to stay to notify people ' ? parents and loved ones who called up  --  so I agreed to stay in the office , " Harry Gottlieb said . " Of course , this has nothing to do with what is happening today . ft 's a bit of vivid historical background , " Augustus Goertz said . " But it was very exciting . It is a fragment of the mosaic of American history . What we did was , some of us went down to the Regional Director 's office on phony errands and we let the others in . We all linked arms and we would n't let them take us out . The cops came , but they could only take one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember I had my arms linked to two people , and two cops were pulling at my legs and the buttons on my overcoat almost popped off . We all ended up in jail , and when we were arraigned we all gave the names of Old Masters  --  Mr. van Gogh , Mr. Rembrandt , et cetera . When our case came before the judge , the cops could n't identify any of us , so they let us go . " " Vito Marcantnnio was the lawyer for the artists , " Mr. Gottlieb said . " We had no photographer , so I made a very realistic painting of it , " Sarah Beach said . " I 'm planning to give it to the exhibition . " Harry Gottlieb explained that next fall there was to be an exhibition mounted of the past and present work of two hundred W.P.A. artists who are still painting in New York , and that he was vice-chairman of the committee in charge . " There is a big interest now in W.P.A. artists , " Ron Doud said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a club in the Village . " ? S pFcrAL WHEN Lrr : Joe Misiti , one of the young proprietors of Special When Lit , which is a store that sells new and reconditioned pinball machines , gave a party the other night on his premises , on Greenwich Avenue . Early in the evening , there were more machines in the room than people . Among the machines were Buckaroo and Flipper Cowboy , both of which have animated back-glasses ; Captain Fantastic , which Joe Misiti 's partner , a young girl who calls herself Pinball Patty , obtained from a man who won it in an Elton John promotion ; and Four Million B.C. , a German machine . Pinball Patty introduced her guests to the machines , all of which were set up to play unlimited free games . " Where did you get this German one ? " we asked her . " Germany , " she said . Four Million B.C. has a very eccentric board , which allows the player to 26 FEBRUARY 2. 8 19 7 7 keep as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine is tilted , the word " Gekippt " shows on the back-glass . " See ? " said Pinball Patty . " I like all the German words . Look at the kicker buttons . " The kicker buttons were in German , too . " I 've played pinball all over Europe , and all over the Jersey shore , " Pinball Patty said . Joe 11/lisiti and Pinball Patty think of themselves as running a high-priced gift shop , where the items range from about three hundred dollars to thirteen hundred . New pinball machines are not usually bought outright . An operator places a machine in a " location " without charge and then collects half the revenue . Reconditioned machines , however , are available for outright sale , and cost only half as much as the new ones . Later in the evening , there were more people than machines , and people had to wait for a chance to play . We saw Gasper Ingui , the proprietor of Artistic Neon , of Glendale , Long Island . Mr. Ingui began in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During his apprenticeship , he worked at making Ballantine-beer signs ; he made the letters " B " and " E. " A few years ago , he was drawn into the new neon-art movement . He was at the pinball party because , at a certain level , the new neon-art movement has intersected the new pinball movement . There are ? ? neon-art works by Gasper Ingui on display at Special When Lit . " You must have heard of Sri Chinmoy , the guru , " Mr. Ingui said to us . " I did a piece for Sri Chinmoy  --  a rose . He roust be pretty thrilled with it , because he has it in his home . " We also met a very young girl named Hillary Richards and a very young man named Kerry Kollrnar . They told us they were involved in a cable-television program that used pinball machines . " It 's called ' The Game Show , ' " Kerry told us . " We have a pinball machine , and we 've attached a device to the flippers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch-tone phones . " AFEW days later , Kerry , wearing jeans , earth shoes , and suspenders that were a promotional device for Rolling Stone , faced two color-television cameras in the studios of the Experimental Television Cooperative , which feeds Manhattan Cable Television ( from 110 East Twenty-third Street , second floor ) , on the occasion of the first live telecast of " The Game Show . " Hillary , dressed in a red shirt and a black velvet skirt , stood stock-still beside him . Behind Hillary and Kerry was a gray curtain . To Kerry 's left was a pinball machine  --  an Airport from Special When Lit  --  whose flipper buttons had been fitted with small metal plungers designed to respond ( with a brisk in-out movement ) to the sound impulses generated by touch-tone telephone . For a time , Hillary and Kerry and Airport were silent together in a stiff tableau , waiting for the show to go on the air . There was clearly an aura of extension about this tableau : the second-generation hip ethic that Kerry and Hillary seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the notion of playing a pinball game had been extended to encompass an unexpected aspect of remote control ; the idea of calling in to a television program had been extended to encompass communication with a machine . Extension and juxtaposition are essential to novelty ( although not to originality ) , and we looked forward to seeing something new . Also , as the tableau held , it was impossible not to notice that there were three levels of sophistication evident in " The Game Show " : the modest level represented by the immediate human effort involved ; a middle ground occupied by the pinball machine Airport ; and the very high level on which the **36;5501;TOOLONG interface was operating . When " The Game Show " went on the air , Kerry explained to the television public that the left-hand flipper button of Airport could be worked by-pressing the digit 1 on a touch-tone telephone , that the right-hand button would respond to the digit 3 , but that it was not possible to activate both flippers at once . " This is a concept that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kerry said . " This pinball machine is Airport , made in the year 1969 , " Hillary said . A young woman named Linda called on the telephone . One of the color cameras went into a closeup of the board of Airport while the other stayed on Kerry , who put a ball in action . The ball , rolling down the board , nearly went into one of the side alleys that make Airport such a difficult machine to play , but the ball missed the alley and came within range of the left-hand flipper . Linda , seeing her opportunity ( on her television screen ) , pressed the digit 1 on her touch-tone telephone and , activating the left-hand flipper at just the right moment , sent the ball back to the top of the board . " She 's got it back up there , " Kerry said . " Come on , Linda , " Hillary said . Linda scored two thousand two hundred and seventy-seven points on Airport , with two balls . The next player , a young man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , who was named Ron , asked if he might sec his score as he played . Since " The Game Show " also had two black-and-white cameras , this was possible . One of them ( the other was transmitting the studio 's telephone number ) picked up the score on the back-glass of the machine , and the engineer cut in the image of the score over the image of the board , so that both were visible to Ron and others in the audience . Ron did very badly on his first ball  --  it just rolled down the middle , leaving him with a score of one hundred and fifty-one . " I do n't know , " Ron said . " I think maybe the score is a little distracting . " The board alone appeared on the television screen for Ron 's second ball , and he did better , ending up with a score of one thousand two hundred and eighty-nine . By this point , it was obvious that " The Game Show " was going to he successful as novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became slightly more aggressive in his manner . When Ron 's first ball flopped , Kerry was candid . " Well , you got dumped on with a mere one hundred and fifty-one , " Kerry said . " Can we say another special thanks to Special When Lit , who furnished the pinball game ? " said Hillary to Kerry , off microphone . " No , let 's not do that , " said Kerry . When " The Game Show " went off the air , Kerry ran to the control booth . " It 's a hit , and you did n't tape it ! " he shouted to Dan Fodor , the show 's producer and engineer . Then he went to a telephone and called a friend at Rolling Stone . " Did Joe watch it ? " Kerry asked , referring to Joe Armstrong , the publisher of Rolling Stone . " Joe watched it ! " Kerry shouted to others in the control room . " Did Jann watch it ? " he asked , referring to Jann Wenner , the editor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll watch it next week , " Kerry said . ? PUNT : Events at C. B . G. B. &; O.M.F.U.G. , the Bowery night club ( where there is in operation a coherent social and musical aesthetic ) , possess the qualities of low-level threat , low-level claustrophobia , and that sense of free time we can associate  --  thinking of telephones  --  with the telephone " hold " button . Many other , mandatory urban experiences possess these qualities , but at C.B.G.B. 's there is intention as well , and the right amount of irony for this moment  --  an amount that is just enough to be noticed . The prevalent ratio of wit to toughness is nicely indicated by some wall-writing near the hack of the room which reads " Nancy is so ugly . " A young man called Legs , who is often there , was there the other night with the new issue of the magazine Punk  --  the one with the English group the Sex Pistols on the cover  --  and so were three girls in dark lipstick . ( There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung out together . ) One of the three was called Roxy and had a significant run in her antique stockings . Another had sent away to England for two packets of special hair dye  --  one pink , one blue , and one for Roxy , one for herself  --  and she was in a fury because the post office had sent them hack to England . The third was a good listener . There used to be a number of girls who wore dark lipstick at Max 's Kansas City , but they all looked as though they had been to a great many places and had ended up at Max 's . At C.B.G.B. 's , the girls in dark lipstick look as though they were taking their first step out of the Outer Boroughs . Danny Fields , the editor of the magazine Sixteen , was there , because the Ramones were playing and he manages the Ramones . The Ramones are four young men from Forest Hills , none of whom are named Ramone . " I refused to see them for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny Fields said . " I thought they did Salsa . " In reality , what the Ramones do is very hard rock-and-roll . " Until the Kamones , I never heard a band that was hard enough for me , " Danny Fields said . " Either it was n't hard enough or it had blues in it . This had no blues in it . I was so delighted . " The Ramones began to play , and we sat at a small table with Danny Fields to listen . In front of us were a number of crowded tables and the stage ; in back of us were a few more tables and a lot of people standing up at the bar . There was not much incandescent light . At C.B.G.B. 's , neon beer signs
