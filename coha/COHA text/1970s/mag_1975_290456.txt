Although the impact of still higher fuel prices in the economy will remain unclear for some time , indications are mounting that the long-awaited recovery is arriving sooner and snappier than many forecasts had predicted . Last week the Commerce Department reported that its index of leading indicators , which foretell the future direction of the economy , was up substantially in July for the fifth straight month . Meanwhile , the Labor Department announced revised figures showing a 5.8% rise during the April-June quarter in productivity in private non-farm sector jobs , which is vital to corporate profits and has been slipping for most of the past two years . Still , not all the signs are sweet , and in fact they are turning sour in one key area : the cost of the money that consumers and companies need to buy the goods and finance the building needed to create jobs and profits . <P> Up Smartly . For two months interest rates have been climbing worrisomely . Early last week the rate on 13-week Treasury bills rose from 6.4% in mid-August to nearly 6.6% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for short-term money since January . Recently the Treasury was forced to pay more than 8.5% on four-year notes , or barely .5 percentage points under the mid-1974 peak of 9% . Private borrowers , too , are beginning to feel a money pinch . Having settled down to a two-year low of 7% in early June , the prime rate charged for credit-worthy corporate customers has inched back up to 7% at most commercial banks . <P> The cost of money is rising mainly because other prices are moving up smartly . Alarmed by the 1.2% jump in consumer prices in July , which translates into a compound annual rate of 15.4% , commercial banks and other lenders are protecting themselves against the possibility of continued double-digit inflation by charging more for their money-especially on some long-term loans . Rates on four-year Treasury bills are now two percentage points higher than three-month rates-an unusually wide spread that plainly signals an upsurge in inflationary expectations in the money markets . <P> Although inflation is the chief villain , heavy borrowing by the Treasury to finance the Ford Administration 's $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . So , too , has a deliberate tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board . Having allowed the money supply to expand at an unusually brisk annual rate of 14% to 15% during May and June , the Federal Reserve cut back slightly in July to bring monetary growth more in line with its announced goal of 5% to 7% per year . Chairman Arthur Burns has been emphasizing recently that the nation 's central bank " will continue to pursue " policies aimed at staying within that target .
