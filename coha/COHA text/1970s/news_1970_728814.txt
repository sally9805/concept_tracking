txt South Vietnam 's armed-forces commander says he believes Hanoi plans to maintain a generally low level of fighting in South Vietnam for the next year or so until most of the American troops are withdrawn . Then , in his view , the Communists will try to strike again hard Gen , Cao Van Vien said that if he were running the show in Hanoi he would adopt precisely the same strategy which the Communists appear to have decided on for the moment  --  one of low-level , protracted warfare aimed at preserving manpower for a bigger push once most of the Americans are gone . Election timing forecast That push , the general predicted , probably would come in 1971 when the bulk of the American combat forces are expected to be withdrawn . By mid-1971 , bigger battles could be expected once again , said the general , in a rare interview at his office near the Saigon airport . General Vien did not. , however , rule out the possibility of small , localized offensives occurring before the end of this year , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . He thought it likely , for instance , that Associated Press Gen. Cao Van Vien North Vietnamese forces would kick off some kind of offensive in the northernmost provinces of South Vietnam sometime this fall to coincide with the elections in the United States later this year . " The Communists always link their military offensives with political aims , " said the general , who has been chief of the joint general staff of the South Vietnamese armed forces for the past five years . General Vien said a South Vietnamese Marine brigade was flown into the I Corps area embracing the five ' northernmost provinces three weeks ago to help meet the threat there , a threat which he felt could be successfully contained . Terrorism discounted Unlike some other military officers and government officials , the general did not seem concerned about this year 's rise in assassinations and kidnappings in the countryside , or the fact that the Communist forces are concentrating their efforts increasingly on the government 's pacification program . " We can cope with this , " General Vien said , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare was a sign of weakness on the part of the Viet Cong . The armed forces commander appeared to be as much concerned about the economic plight of his troops as anything else . Living on low , fixed incomes , South Vietnam 's soldiers , along with its civil servants , have suffered more than anyone else from the steady inflation brought on by the war . // *Viet chief sees Red blitz in ' 71 // General Vien feels that raising the soldiers ' salaries is not the answer to their problems because , in his view , this would immediately trigger more price increases , which would in turn wipe out any advantages to be gained from bigger salaries . The solution , he said , is to set up a post-exchange and commissary system to provide inexpensive food and necessities to the troops and their families . The nucleus of such a system has already been established in cooperation with the U.S. command here , and it is being expanded , he said . The general said that a recently published report that the desertion rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said the total number of desertions had increased , but that this was because the size of the armed forces had increased greatly over the past year . Thus , he said , there was no increase this year in terms of percentages compared with what he described as a desertion rate last year of 1.6 percent out of the total armed forces strength . No duration predicted General Vien declined to be drawn into making any firm predictions about the possible duration of the war such as that made by President Thieu recently when he told correspondents the war might fade away , except for some limited fighting in unpopulated jungle areas , within the next three years . In looking to the future , the armed forces commander was obviously concerned over the continuing infiltration of North Vietnamese troops through Laos into South Vietnam , which he said was on the rise this year . An estimated 1,800 tons of supplies , ammunition , and equipment were moving monthly down the Ho Chi Minh Trail , he said , compared with 1,100 tons at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently , from an estimated 12,000 a month last year to an estimated 15,000 this year , he said . From a strictly military point of view , therefore , it would make a great deal of sense to send troops into Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail , General Vien said , though both U.S. and South Vietnamese leaders have been publicly ruling out this possibility . South Vietnam , General Vien said , is like a basin filled with water . The Viet Cong are the water . The South Vietnamese armed forces are trying to empty the water out of the basin . " But if we can not turn off the faucet which keeps refilling the basin , then the war could last 20 or even 40 years . " Another worry for the future , General Vien said , were the more than 300,000 regular Army troops in North Vietnam which Hanoi has not yet committed to the war . According to the general , some of these troops might be sent southward after the American withdrawals from South Vietnam have reached an advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
