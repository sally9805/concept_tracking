txt Can police departments market crime prevention like soda pop and laundry detergent ? The Dallas Police Department is spending $336,000 on a 10-monthprogram to find out . It is an attempt , perhaps the first of its kind . on such a massive scale , to reduce the Dallas crime rate , which is soaring . Most U.S. urban communities have the same problem . Police Chief Donald Byrd believes that the typical Dallas citizen is willing to join in thefight against crime ? if he understands the problem . Chief Byrd is hopeful an advertising campaign by his department will alert the 800,000 residents of Dallas to the fact that they can prevent much crime . That 's the idea behind the campaign 's slogan : " Do n't ask for it . " One of Chief Byrd 's newspaper ads , for example , suggests that an alert neighborhood can thwart many crimes . A photograph shows a group of middle-class residents with the headline : " Tough crime prevention unit . You and your neighbors . " The closing lines of the ad urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . If you and your neighbors are op the watch for them they wo n't have a chance . " The " neighborhood check group " idea is only one of several being promoted in an advertising blitz using 19 Dallas-area radio stations , five television stations , two daily newspapers , Dallas Transit Company buses and their overhead ad cards , and a number of church , minority , and suburban weekly publications . A second 10-month campaign will appeal to Dallas radio-TV stations for free public service air time . " Many of the stations have indicated their willingness to provide it , " a spokesman sayi . During the second phase , the print media will be used sparingly . // * How to popularize the fight against crime // In filming the campaign 's television commercials , the department 's agency used actual policemen instead of actors . One commercial shows two patrolmen stopping their patrol car on a quiet Dallas street . One of the officers gets out and walks to an open garage door . After picking up an old newspaper , he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " " Police departments have dabbled with advertising before , but mostly in the areas of recruiting , " says Ed Spencer , a civilian police department employee and coordinator of advertising for the anti-crime campaign . " But this is the first extensive general ad campaign of this type that we know of . The idea was tried statewide at one point in Illinois , but it did n't work well , I understand , because of a lack of money . " To finance his campaign , Chief Byrd turned to the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration ( LEAA ) which provided a $787,205 grant , about half of which is going into the ad campaign . The remainder is supporting related crime-prevention activi ties , including speech training for 130 Dallas policemen and market surveys to evaluate the effects of the anti-crime campaign . The need for citizen involvement in crime prevention was demonstrated by a pre-campaign marketing survey . Says Mr. Spencer , " It showed that 137 of the 800 people contacted had been victims of a crime in the past six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reported to the Dallas Police Department . " Also , more than half of the sample was unaware that the Dallas crime rate was worse today than six months ago . If its " Do n't ask for it " campaign is a success , the Dallas Police Department is well aware that the city 's crime rate may get worse in a hurry . " We are encouraging better reporting of criminal activities , " Mr. Spencer says . " And that could send the figures even higher . " But that thought does not alarm the city 's police chief . He is all in favor of the city 's citizens doing their part , as he phrases it , to make it " harder for criminals to ' do their thing . ' "
