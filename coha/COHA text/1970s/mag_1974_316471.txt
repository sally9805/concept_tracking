Investors have concluded lately that most major currencies will lose much of their purchasing power in the months ahead . The doubts have set off a worldwide stampede to buy tangible commodities of all kinds : copper , silver , sugar , even potatoes . Most of all , the nervous are buying gold , a mystical symbol of eternal value . The price of gold rocketed up to a record $163 an ounce in London last week , almost double the quote a year ago , and up $23.50 in less than a month ( see chart ) . <P> The gold rush is paradoxical for two reasons . Gold price leaps used to reflect primarily doubts about the worth of the dollar-but the dollar 's price in foreign currencies has generally been climbing for the past several months . Also , the values of most major currencies are no longer formally tied to gold . But now investors are disturbed by forecasts that inflation will average close to 9% in the U.S. this year , 10% to 15% in Europe , as much as 20% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer goods and services , no matter what the price at which they can be exchanged for each other . <P> Now , gold is being purchased avidly by just about anyone with assets to protect : corporations , banks , Arab oil sheiks , offshore mutual funds , Germans who still remember the wallpaperization of their currency in the Weimar years , and French farmers . <P> Even American citizens are joining the rush . They can not yet legally buy gold bars , but they have always been permitted to own gold coins . Sales of British sovereigns , Mexican 50-peso coins and good old double eagles ( U.S. $20 gold pieces ) are booming . In the past two weeks alone , double eagles traded in New York have gone from $200 apiece to nearly $300 . <P> Some central bankers are showing renewed interest in gold , too , although it is supposed to be phased out of the world monetary system . Some government officials have suggested tripling or quadrupling the " official " $42.22 price of gold held by government banks ; that might enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported oil . The U.S. opposes any move that would enhance the role of gold in international finance . If the Common Market countries raised the official price and the U.S. and other nations did not , the move might be interpreted in the markets as amounting to a devaluation of their currencies , although under the present rules of the monetary system it actually would not be . A Common Market revaluation of gold without agreement from other countries , however , would violate the rules of the International Monetary Fund . <P> Whatever happens to the official price , traders can see little that might bring the free-market price down soon . Production in South Africa , which mines most of the world 's gold , has been declining in recent years as veins become played out-a trend that has helped keep the price up . Contrary to myth , however , gold purchasing is not without risk . The world supply available for trading is so small that the sudden sale of a few million dollars ' worth could yet send the price plunging .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
