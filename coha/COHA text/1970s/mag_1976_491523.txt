A PILGRIMAGE FOR PEACE The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Centennial and Hawaii reflects on Cardinal John Joseph Krol 's journey to the Holy Land . By James A. Michener The oldest building in the world in unbroken use as a Christian place of worship is the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem , the Holy Land , scene of the first Christmas nearly two thousand years ago . A low , massive building , it was originally constructed by Emperor Constantine in A.D. 330 and has often been patched up and reconstructed since then . It is one of the holiest places in Christendom , and a visit there is the goal of pilgrims worldwide . To its small entrance door , with top so low that even short men and women must bow to enter , came an unusual pilgrim not long ago . He was a tall man , over six feet , so that he had to double up to enter the holy place , and he was a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . A prince of the most powerful church on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowly born son of a carpenter . It was also his purpose to further Christ 's teachings about brother  --  hood . For John Joseph Krol , Car  --  dinal of the Archdiocese of Phil  --  adelphia , this emotional visit to Bethlehem was one more halt in his international pilgrimage for peace . In previous years he had visited Poland , Ireland , and In  --  dia , talking with national lead  --  ers , meeting the heads of the lo  --  cal churches and always praying with resident populations . But the highlight of his tours would be this one to the Holy Land and the surrounding coun  --  tries . In quick order he would traverse many of the sites famil  --  iar to Jesus and the men and women who founded Christian  --  ity . He would visit Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , and Egypt , always endeavoring to define those problems which good intentions and fellowship might alleviate . In Bethlehem he focused on this Church of the Nativity , the ancient , sprawling edifice with cool , cavernous insides where candles provided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A forest of pillars rose from the floor like cedars of Lebanon , supporting a distant roof , while trapdoors with big iron rings decorated the slabs of the uneven floor . When Cardinal Krol entered this most sacred of buildings he confronted a curious problem which faces all Roman Catholic prelates when they visit either Jerusalem or Bethlehem . The holy places of Christendom  --  all of them  --  have always been controlled by the eastern branches of the Catholic Church , and never by Rome . Thus , the Church of the Nativity is under the general supervision of the Green Orthodox and Armenian Churches . But in the grotto beneath the church floor , where the manger in which Jesus was born is still preserved , the Roman Catholics do possess certain rights , especially the control of the manger itself . To gain entrance to this sanctuary , Cardinal Krol 's party was required to descend by narrow stone stairs to a cryptlike opening in the rock . This was the dark , quiet spot at which Christ was born , and where every visi  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene . The fact that John Joseph Krol should be leading two hun  --  dred pilgrims through the Holy Land was itself a miracle . Born the son of Polish immigrants to Cleveland , he had spent his child  --  hood in a modest house in an impoverished ethnic neighbor  --  hood , surrounded by hostile en  --  claves of other ethnic groups which forbade trespass on their turf . Krol 's father was a handy  --  man unusually skilled in picking up the manual arts by watching experts perform tasks which he could then imitate with a re  --  markable degree of skill . Young Krol , always big for his age , attended St. Hyacinth 's Catholic grade school , and while still attending Cleveland 's Cathe  --  dral Latin High School he landed a job in a local box factory . At this time he felt no call to the priesthood and was so content with civilian life that , upon grad  --  uation at age sixteen , he went to work for a chain grocery store , was made store manager at age eighteen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Lutheran with whom he did business kept ask  --  ing Krol so many persistent ques  --  tions about religious doctrine that he began to suspect that God may have been using this interrogation as a test of his ca  --  pacity for religious life . Of this experience he would say later , " Our Lord says , ' You do not choose me , I choose you ' ; He has his own ways . He uses people , and if it is His intention that you are to become a priest , nothing will prevent this outcome . " So the promising young businessman sold his Model T Ford , strapped his battered suitcase together and marched off to the seminary . Even before he had been graduated , his superiors had identified him as a young man of considerable promise . After Continued on page 74 Michener continued from page 67 ordination he was assigned to the Polish-speaking Immaculate Heart of Mary parish in his old Cleveland neighborhood , where he heard con  --  fessions , walked through the snow to visit shut-ins , married off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a short time , though , he was to his astonish  --  ment sent to Rome for the further  --  ance of his education . " It was a notable experience , " Krol recalls . " All of my classmates at Gregorian University in Rome were destined to serve the church con  --  spicuously . Cardinal Conway of Ire  --  land was in my class picture . " One of the best experiences was Rome itself , this timeless city . " When he left Rome hurriedly in 1940 , just before the Italians went to war , he was a devout , sophisticated priest recognized by his contempo  --  raries as a young man to watch . He resumed priestly duties in the Cleve  --  land area and before long became a bishop . Even then there was specu  --  lation that he was destined to be  --  come a prince of the church , but tradition dictated that the church have only seventy Cardinals , a vast majority of them Italian , working in sequestered quarters within the shadows of the Vatican . In this sys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer Cardinals than their numbers would have war  --  ranted , and this represented some  --  thing of a scandal , especially when the substantial financial contribu  --  tions of the American Catholics were considered . Pope Paul VI and his immediate predecessor , Pope John XXIII , changed this , announcing that they would no longer be bound by the tradition of seventy , and that hence  --  forth as many Cardinals as the grow  --  ing church required would be ap  --  pointed . In 1967 Paul selected Krol , who was then Archbishop of Phila  --  delphia , to be one of the nine Car  --  dinals from the United States . His post would be the Philadelphia Arch  --  diocese . The appointment caused a sensa  --  tion . Krol , who had never sought responsibility nor turned any down , was Polish-American , and Philadel  --  phia had grown accustomed to Irish-Americans as prelates , be they bish  --  ops , archbishops or cardinals . Mary Quinn , a widowed septua  --  genarian housewife from the city 's Mount Airy section , had difficulty comprehending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Car  --  dinal . They gave it to Krol . " " OWho ? " Mrs. Quinn called back . " No , just Krol , the Polish bish  --  op . " " Oh my God , not even an Ital  --  ian . " The burgeoning numbers in the College of Cardinals astonishedmany , but the prize headline came from Krol 's brother 's neighborhood in Ohio , where the local newspaper proclaimed , " Al Krol 's Brother Named Cardinal . " The new Cardinal at once estab  --  lished his credentials , winning praise not only from his tiny Polish faith  --  ful , but also from the huge Irish and Italian majorities in Philadelphia . He proved himself austerely conserva  --  tive in churchly dogma , but warmly liberal in civic matters . Quickly he became a national leader in defending the church 's po  --  sition on doctrine . Unwavering in his dedication to Catholic principles , he became the most outspoken oppo  --  nent of the Supreme Court 's legaliza  --  tion of abortion . " No right over one 's body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be exercised at the expense of the right to life of another human being . Others are also threatened , the aged , the incurably ill , and all who may come to be regarded by society as undesirable or burdensome . " He also fought vigorously for the right of Catholic schools to obtain governmental funds and was again bitterly opposed to the Supreme Court 's various decisions denying his church schools access to those funds . Krol 's devotion to Catholic school  --  ing is evidenced by the $120 million in construction he piloted in his first ten years in Philadelphia . He has often showed himself to be a stalwart defender of Pope Paul in the latter 's pronouncement on birth control and has rebuked those who propagate the use of contracep  --  tives as a vehicle for social reform . " It is especially reprehensible , " Cardinal Krol has said , " to see public assistance programs , designed for the poor , used as instruments for estab  --  lish ing population level controls . " Krol has also opposed any weak  --  ening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a basic tenet of the priesthood , since priests are , bib  --  lically speaking , " to be left free for the things of God . " Krol states , " Unmistakably , the value of priestly celibacy is most important today for the church and all of humanity and should be retained . " Because of such orthodoxy , and because of the death of Cardinal Spellman of New York , Krol found himself pushed forward as the spokesman of the Catholic Church in America . To his surprise he was elected president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , and in this capacity was called upon to represent the church in various mat  --  ters . He gave testimony to lawmak  --  ing bodies , offered the invocation at a 1972 national political convention , and spoke vigorously for self-de  --  termination and freedom for op  --  pressed minorities . It was during Krol 's presidency of this conference that the bishops rec  --  ommended that if there was ever to be any round-table discussion of the future of Palestine , the Palestinians had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake . This , the bishops felt , was the Palestinian prerogative . " They have a right to a state , " the bishops decided , " and a right to compensation for past losses to be paid for by any members of the in  --  ternational community responsible for the 1948 partition of their land . " At the same time that Cardinal Krol was establishing a nationwide reputation for religious leadership , he was proving himself to be a man of the widest humanitarian concern . He has welcomed blacks into the schools of his archdiocese whether they were Catholics or not . " If I were a priest and I could choose , " Cardinal Krol reflected , " I would work in a black neighbor  --  hood . They have a lightness of spirit that reflects the Gospel . Many of them are forced to live from day to day , and many of them know how to be happy without worrying . " Krol , the street-wise former workingman , has always been con  --  sidered a friend of labor . He is deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re  --  spects the world is changing , and has always been concerned with the problems of the young . " Charity with justice , " is how Krol approached the Vietnam am  --  nesty question , urging , " a generous pardon to those convicted under the laws of the Selective Service Act , with the understanding that sincere conscientious objectors should re  --  main open in principle to some form of service to the community . " I have been privileged to spend many hours with Cardinal Krol in different countries and have ob  --  served his reactions to varied situa  --  tions . I have found him to be in  --  tensely interested in the people about him , as much at home with Palestinian refugees as with Israeli businessmen . I have listened while Krol , a brilliant man able to speak ten languages , conversed in collo  --  quial Spanish to refugees from Cuba , and in Polish to convent children . He is especially considerate of young and elderly priests who come to him with problems and is attentive to the nuns of any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his priestlike best when he visits hospitals and or  --  phanages . He has a remarkable sense of humor and is the master of the one-line sardonic joke . He enjoys a beer with his friends , has always followed sports and is widely informed on most aspects of American life . When I have been with him I have had a good laugh at least once every half hour and I recall when , at the end of a very solemn session with some stal  --  wart Catholics , he startled them with his final blessing , " Be good . Love one another . And try to stay out of jail . " Cardinal Krol acted no different  --  ly in the Holy Land . After his oblig  --  atory visits to the great sanctuaries of his religion , he delighted in meet  --  ing with local politicians , where his priestly candor sometimes surprised them , and always his dedication to ecumenism was obvious . In Israel he paid homage at the Wailing Wall , sacred to the Jews , but also at the Dome of the Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab ref  --  ugee camps which are such a sore point in Near East relations , and in Lebanon he met in consultation with primates of the various Eastern churches , sharing with them their apprehensions about the future of this strife-ridden state . storm among Jewish newspapers , and Krol was presented to their readers as a Catholic dignitary spon  --  soring the Palestinian guerrillas . When the storm subsided , however , Krol was seen not as a man speaking against the Jews , but one in favor of a general peace in the region . Rabbi Morris Dembowitz , presi  --  dent of the Board of Rabbis of Greater Philadelphia , called Krol 's statements " those of a man of God , whose central concern was peace , and forthright in the tradition of our shared heritage . " Today this tall , vigorous Cardinal occupies one of the principal posi tions in the church . Certain nations , like France , nominate one of their Cardinals to be the primate in that Continued on page 84 But it was in Egypt that Krol did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American church 's friendship and determina  --  tion . He traveled widely among the political leaders of this country and held long consultations with Coptic Catholics who have always played an outstand  --  ing role in Egyptian his  --  tory . What does an American Cardinal accomplish on such a trip ? First of all , he gives the world evidence that as a nation Americans are concerned with the wel  --  fare of other countries . He proves to the local leaders that his church is not indif  --  ferent to their problems . He demonstrates a willing  --  ness to listen and gives evi  --  dence of a compassion for the ills that beset all com  --  munities . And above all , he returns home with a better understanding of the com  --  plexities of the modern world . On his pilgrimage to the Holy Land , Cardinal Krol could not escape the pas  --  sions that mark this tor  --  mented part of the world . While stopping in Amman he was taken to an impro  --  vised camp housing Pales  --  tinian refugees who in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Krol was appalled at the conditions under which they were living , at the ani  --  mosity he saw in the eyes of children who had known no other home . The earth  --  en shanties that had no floors , the rude streets that had no sewers . The wretchedness of the camp preyed on his mind , and he became convinced that this insanity should be ended . Late that night at a press conference the Car  --  dinal was asked , " If the Pal  --  estinians present their case to the United Nations in New York , would it be per  --  missible for Yasir Arafat to represent them ? " Krol , re  --  calling the decision made years earlier by the Ameri  --  can bishops , replied briefly , " Why not ? " He added that he considered Arafat a human being and entitled to the rights accruing to all man kind . This response aroused a continued from page 75 country , usually the man represent  --  ing the oldest district , and he speaks for the church . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Cardinals to be primate , but in the passage of years certain preeminent Cardinals have enjoyed that distinction informally . The great Cardinal Gibbons of Balti  --  more held that honor , and so did Cardinal Spellman of New York . It seems probable that John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia could become the informal primate of this country , a remarkable conservative-liberal who serves both his church and his society well . There is speculation on what will happen when Pope Paul VI dies or retires to allow the Papal throne to be occupied by a younger leader . The chances are overwhelming that when a vacancy does occur , an  --  other Italian will be chosen , for this has been the tradition since the reign of Adrian VI , a Dutchman , ended in 1523 ; and under it the church has prospered . Numerous Italian Car  --  dinals now serving are papabile ( qualified to become Pope ) , so there would be no necessity to seek out  --  side their ranks ; although there is the delicious possibility , however long the odds , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of the Cardinals . In theory , any breath  --  ing male Catholic can be elected Pope , be he a preadolescent tinker from the alleyways of Belfast , or a married shopkeeper from a town in New Jersey . And there has been quite a bit of whispered discussion over the past forty years that perhaps the time has come for the consideration of some non-Italian . The stormy politics of Italy and the desire to heal old schisms among the rites are two valid reasons . Others include the fact that Italians are outnumbered in the Col  --  lege of Cardinals and that numerous Cardinals outside of Italy are emi  --  nently papabile . Cardinal Cooke of New York would be one . And cer  --  tainly Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia . If insensitive , would-be king  --  makers broach this delicate subject , Krol tells them , " This is one position I would never seek , because I feel I am needed right here in my own backyard . " " It is terribly presumptuous of any man to think about the possibil  --  ity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't imagine anyone aspiring to the burdensome , tiring duties of the Papacy . It is a much more satisfying duty to visit the sick or to console the relatives of the dead . " Rome , St. Peter 's , Vatican City , they are all so awesome , frightening even . If given the luxury of day  --  dreaming , I 'd rather daydream that all of my bills have been paid and my schools have just received some mysterious grant that will keep'them open for all time  --  or at least until it is someone else 's turn to worry about them . " LI continued from page 81 act in a heartless , vindictive man  --  ner  --  as a means of punishing the former President . And , Mr. Nixon 's supporters would like to know , why did n't President Ford step in and raise his voice against such unseemly treat  --  ment of his predecessor ? The feeling is that the President has been seeking to assuage the anti-Nixon savagery still lurking in the media and a Dem  --  ocratic-controlled Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ford . Many Nixonites do n't feel he is as conservative as Ronald Reagan . And while they cheered Mr. Ford for his handling of the Mayaguez incident , they were positively outraged by his undiplomatic slighting of Alexander Solzhenitsyn . As for detente , they never believed it should mean a dimi  --  nution in efforts to expose the true nature of the Communist beast . And Secretary Kissinger 's coddling of the Castro regime , presumably with President Ford 's blessing , leaves them absolutely cold . Even before he was forced to leave the Soviet Union , Solzhenitsyn made reference to the " dense hypoc  --  risy characteristic of today 's Ameri  --  can political life " and most notably " of the Senate leaders with their dis  --  torted view of the discordant Water  --  gate affair . " " Without in any way defending Nixon or the Republican party , " the Nobel laureate went on , " how can one not be amazed at the hypocrit  --  ical , clamorous rage displayed by the Democrats ? " Has American politics not been full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except , perhaps , that they were not on such a high level of electronic technology and remained happily undiscovered ? " Never have I seen truer words written . Meanwhile , as he works on his memoirs , Mr. Nixon ca n't help thinking of the future . And this is Ho hat troubles some of his critics who fear that , as he has in the past , he will make some sort of political come  --  back . But resuming an active polit  --  ical career is the last thing Mr. Nixon has on his mind . So his critics can breathe more easily . But what does a man in his ex  --  traordinary position do ? What role can he play in which he will be able to utilize his enormous talents and experience in all aspects of public life ? These are questions he mulls over constantly with family and friends .
