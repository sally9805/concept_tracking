One hot June evening 51 years ago , a scared young man named Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones stepped off the train at Grumbling , a tiny community in the pine woods of northern Louisiana . At 19 , newly graduated from Southern University near Baton Rouge , he faced a formidable mission : to teach biology , chemistry and physics , shape up a football team , strike up a band , act as registrar , and help cut firewood at Grambling 's 25-year-old school for black teachers . <P> Jones succeeded so well that in ten years he took over as president . Over the next 41 years , he saw his country school blossom into Grambling State University , legendary in pro football and a leader in remedial education . At 71 , Jones is finally retiring this spring . TIME Education Editor Annalyn Swan visited Grambling to talk with him about his half-century in black education . Her report : <P> " Prez , " as Jones is affectionately known by staff and students alike , is jovial and easygoing-given , as he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern tradition , he splashes his tales with emphatic " Oh , Lord 's " and resounding laughs . As he drives around his 380-acre campus in a canvas-topped Oldsmobile 98 , he waves to students and invites visits to his office . There , a small plaque on his desk proclaims LOVE YOUR ENEMIES ; BLESS THEM THAT CURSE YOU . Says Jones : " I 'm a front-row , ' amen ' Baptist deacon . " <P> When he first arrived in 1926 with a degree in science and men 's tailoring and one homemade suit , he found Grambling to be just a few small wooden buildings lighted by oil lamps . Students often slept two to a bed , board was $10 a month , and both men and women residents worked on the school 's farm to produce their food . The teachers ' salaries were paid with proceeds from a touring minstrel show . Jones ' band was a 17-horn affair-the brass bought on credit from Sears , Roebuck &; Co . Many of its members also played football and would parade out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for impoverished Grambling , Governor Huey P. ( " Kingfish " ) Long approved the school 's efforts in 1928 to become state supported , and the first funds arrived two years later . But not until 1944 was the first B.A. degree awarded , marking Grambling 's ascent from a teacher and trade school to a four-year college . Meanwhile Jones pioneered a field service that toured the backwoods , teaching such basics as hygiene and how to fix a harness . " We were asked off of some plantations , " recalls Jones , " because they thought we were running their labor away . And sharecroppers did leave with the unit quite often because they wanted something better . " On the side , Jones continued to coach baseball , as he still does , amassing over the years an impressive record of victories . <P> Today Grambling is best known primarily for its stellar football teams and its 150 alumni who have played in the pro football leagues . But the college stresses mind over muscle . About 40% of the faculty have Ph.D.s ; most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular major-even among athletes , who once specialized in physical education-as Grambling encourages them to prepare for life after sports . Too , Grambling became a university in 1974 , qualified to grant master 's degrees in education and sports administration .
