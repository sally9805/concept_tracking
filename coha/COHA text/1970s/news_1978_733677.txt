txt President Carter is being urged by his " troika plus one " to reduce the federal budget deficit by about $20 billion each year to the end of his term . . If Mr. Carter accepts this " unanimous " advice from his top economic advisers , said a key White House official , he will have to stand firm against the protests of special-interest groups , all demanding more money . The goals of this tough fiscal policy , the official said , are twofold : ? To show Americans that the White House means business in the nation 's critical fight against inflation . ? To fulfill a Carter campaign promise to get " control of the uncontrollable " ? the huge spending machine of the federal government . " Middle America , " a White House official said , " elected Carter on his pledge to bring government under control . We have not done so . " Budget goals outlined by presidential advisers call for no more than $50 billion worth of red ink in fiscal 1979 ( compared with about $53 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal 1980 , and $15 billion to $20 billion in 1981 . The term " troika plus one " refers to Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Charles L. Schultze , Budget Director James T. McIntyre Jr . ( the troika ) , and Stuart E. Eizenstat , assistant to the President for domestic affairs and policy . // From page 1 Stiff budget cuts urged by Carter advisers Already President Carter has informed Congress in writing that he will not hesitate to veto any spending bill for fiscal 1979 " which I do not believe the country can afford . " Earlier Mr. Carter lopped about $7 billion off the prospective 1979 budget deficit by reducing the size of his suggested income tax cut . A smaller tax cut means more revenue for the government and less for the U.S. Treasury to borrow funds from the banking system . Legislators Praised A senior White- House official gave high marks to the chairmen of the Senate and House budget committee , Sen. Edmund S. Muskie ( D ) of Maine and Rep. Robert N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts to check federal spending . " They face even greater pressure than the President does , " the White House official said , " in standing up against pressure groups in Congress . " Republican leaders are prodding Mr. Carter to cut federal spending even more , charging that outlays are rising about 11 percent yearly . An alternative budget offered by Republicans would hold growth of federal spending to 7.5 percent in fiscal 1979 . Most of this growth results from inflation and from spending mandated by law . Millions of Americans , for example , get higher social security and other benefit payments when the rising cost of living triggers an automatic increase in benefits . Cuts are tough Heal spending cuts , therefore , are extremely hard to make , unless the President and Congress are willing to forgo new spending programs or cut programs already under way . Any ax would seem likely to fall on non-defense spending , because President Carter has agreed ? as part of NATO 's effort to counter the Warsaw Pact 's military buildup ? to boost U.S. defense spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and congressional talk about what kind of national health plan the United States needs , senior Carter economic aids see little likelihood of such a program in the near future ? if fiscal prudence prevails . All this , ironically , seems to cast Mr. Carter in anything but a liberal Democratic mold ? higher defense spending and a hoiddown on social programs .
