txt RONALD REAGAN scored a political hat trick Tuesday , apparently edging President Ford in a close Indiana primary and scoring easy victories in Georgia and Alabama . Though theoretically the late counting could still provide F &d; with a narrow popular victory , the delegate contest was clearly Reagan 's . In Washington , Ford campaign director Rogers C. B. Morton conceded that Reagan had won the majority , of the delegates and would probably carry the popular vote by a narrow margin . " For Jimmy Carter , there was no suspense and not much opposition as the former Georgia governor added to his delegate totals with easy victories in both Indiana and Georgia . Carter took an early lead in the District of Columbia primary , but he Was suffering a disappointment of sorts in Alabama , where George Wallace was heading for his first victory of the campaign year . WITH MORE than 90 per cent of the Indiana precincts counted , Reagan was holding on to a 51 to 49 per cent lead . Reagan was leading in the Gary area , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes in scoring his first ' victory outside the South . Early in the evening , gloom overtook the Ford headquarters , where campaign aides pointed to the apparent crossover of conservative Democrats to vote for Reagan in the Republican primary . " It was Texas revisited , " one dejected Ford aide said , referring to last Saturday 's primary , in which massive Democratic crossovers gave Reagan a sweep of the Lone Star state . But defeat was hard to face . John Breen , the Indiana head of the Ford campaign , had said earlier , " I 'm not giving up . I can remember Feb. 24 . " That was the date of the first primary this year in New Hampshire , where Reagan led most of the night , only to see Ford forge ahead early in the morning and eke out a narrow victory . THAT VICTORY seemed to spell the end of Reagan 's hopes , especially because it led to another Ford victory the next week in Florida . The former governor of California , however , righted himself in North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas . ' Reagan added to his southern string Of victories Tuesday night with a 68 per cent-plus share of the vote In Georgia , and he took an early lead in the Ala. bama delegate contest , winning 28 delegates while Ford has none . On the Democratic side , Wallace headed for his first win , taking 18 of the first 23 delegates chosen , with Carter getting two . Wallace could take no solace from his thowing in Georgia and Indiana . In peorgia , with 97 per cent of the 2,179 precincts reporting , Carter was getting whopping 84 per cent of the vote to 12 per cent for Wallace . CARTER ALSO SEEMED to be sweeping the delegates garnering at least 42 of the 50 delegates in the early returns . Even Julian Bond , the celebrated black state senator running as a delegate pledged to Rep. Morris Udall ( Ariz .. ) , was being swamped in the Carer tide . In Indiana , Carter was getting 68 per cent of the vote to Wallace 's 15 per cent and 12 per cent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livist , was getting 5 per cent of the vote . There seemed to be a clear connection between Wallace 's decline and Reagan 's success . With Wallace 's candidacy a lost cause owing to his defeats in earlier primaries , conservative Democrats and independents have been opting for Republican ballots and casting them for Reagan . Morton said the crossover problem was a real one which will haVe to be dealt with by developing a new strategy for of the states where crossovers could be are permitted . THESE INCLUDE Michigan , whose primary is May 18 ; Tennessee , May 25 , and New Jersey , June 8 . " I think Ford . will win in the non-Southern states where there are no crossovers , " Morton said . " We did not count on the Democrats voting in the Republican primary . " Morton said one of his first tasks would bn to consult with Senators Howard H. Baker and Bill Brock of Tennessee , one of the states were crossovers could be a problem . But he also indicated that the Ford ? campaign may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crossover states . " I 'M NOT PREPARED to give too many details tonight , " Morton said , " but I will say that we will redouble and perhaps concentrate much of our attention in noncrossover states such as Ohio and California . " Though the final Indiana ioutcome remained uncertain , Morton virtually conceded defeat , saying Ford would get only 12 of the state 's 54 delegates . Morton said he hoped for six to 10 delegates from Alabama , but held out no hopes for any of Georgia 's delegates . Reagan aide John Sears predicted victory , saying , " Over ' the weekend it became clear We had the momentum . " Sears made no predictions about next week 's race in Nebraska . If Reagan holds on to his Indiana lead , he will have successfully blunted the argument that he is merely a regional candidate whose success is confined to the South . Ford himself called Indiana " crucial " to his candidacy , which now seems as weakened as Reagan 's was a month ago . FURTHERMORE , the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their party 's challenger with more pledged convention delegates than the incumbent president . The Damociats have no such problems . Ostler went into Tuesday 's voting with at least 428 delegates , and perhaps others quietly pledged to him . After Tuesday 's primaries , he will have more than 550 delegates , well over a third of the 1,505 needed for the nomination . THE REPUBLICAN contest in Indiana once considered a cakewalk for Ford , took on a new complexion alter Reagan 's big win in Texas . The Californian hoped . that his Texas shutout victory would give him the momentum that would strengthen him in Indiana . Though the Indiana vote followed too closely on the heels of Texas for any major new issues to emerge , both candidates threw charges at each other , in the closing days of the campaign . In the two deep-South primaries  --  Georgia and Alabama  --  Reagan seemed on solid ground among the ultra-conservative Republican electorate , but many party leaders backed Ford . In the Alabama Democratic primary , Wallace has made support of him in his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Carter , who filed delegate slates in every congressional district . Wallace retunned the favor , challenging Carter in Georgia . Udall also had pledged delegates running in a few districts around Atlanta .
