txt Initial public reaction has been good to efforts by some financially struggling U.S. airlines to cut out free " frills " ? such as meals ? and thus to reduce air fares . Americans this spring may find they can fly to many destinations at new , 35 percent lower fares minus such extras as free food and drink . Such discounts are being proposed to the Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) by two major airlines ? National and Eastern ? and other carriers are expected to follow , suit . " We 've been quite busy handling calls , " says an Eastern spokesman . " People are asking what it 's all about . We 've already begun to take reservations " . ( which will be canceled without charge if the CAB does not ? approve the plan ) . Harvey Burman of National Airlines says " response has been overwhelming . .. the phones are coming off the wall . People are already making reservations . " Both airlines will continue to offer two free cocktails to coach section passengers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers while National will not offer alcohol to its new " no frills " flyers . Under both the Eastern and National packages : ? Passengers must purchase tickets seven days in advance at the ticket counter of a travel agency ( tickets will not be mailed ) . ? Nonalcoholic beverages will cost a quarter . ? No meals will be served ( passengers may bring their own ) . ? Customers will be charged 10 percent or $10 , whichever is more , for cancellations . ? The fares are available only certain days of the week . // *Cheap air fares coming ? // A third-class fare on a National flight from Miami to Los Angeles , for example , would be $112 , as opposed to the current $183 coach fare . ( Bus fare costs $113.90 and train fare is $178 for that same trip . Some observers are worried the new fares may pull the rug from under Amtrak 's desperate efforts to attract more train passengers ) . - Air travelers this spring will have a variety of discount plans to choose from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and qualifications fixed to them . Airline officials concede the complex requirements ? such as 60-day advance reservations , mileage limits , minimum and maximum numbers of days a traveler must remain at his destination , etc. ? are confusing . But discount " no frills " flying appears to be coming . Laker Airways , a British-owned charter airline , has also applied to the CAB for permission to operate a shuttle between New York and London . Laker officials say they have gained approval of the British Civil Aviation Authority , but they charge the CAB with holding up the needed U.S. approval for " political reasons . " Laker would offer one-way flights to and from London for $135 , about $75 to $100 cheaper than conventional tickets . Laker 's " Skytrain " shuttle would allow passengers to purchase food and drink with their tickets , which they would buy six hours prior to takeoff . Passengers could also bring their own food and drink . Under Eastern 's discount plan , telephone reservations would be accepted , but tickets must be purchased seven days prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . National 's plan does not allow for phone reservations and restricts its " third class " service to wide-body jets only . Both plans are subject to CAB approval and would go into effect in mid-April . Senator checks hot air of committee room Charleston , W.Va . State Sen.
