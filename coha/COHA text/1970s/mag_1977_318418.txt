&gt; As the New York Times 's chief theater critic for the past decade , Clive Barnes is the night mayor of Broadway , a lively , literate reviewer who can make or break a new show with a stroke of the pun . Barnes is also the paper 's leading dance critic , and in a typical week the indefatigable aesthete shuttles from theater to theater covering both arts . <P> His Times editors finally decided that his schedule is too busy and two weeks ago stripped Barnes of his drama post , leaving him with the less prestigious chair of dance critic . The move surprised many at the Times , Barnes among them . " I would like to have been given the choice of which job to keep , " he said , " but I 'm perfectly stoical about it . Presidents last only eight years . " <P> His superiors explain that it was easier to find a new theater critic ( second-string Times film reviewer Richard Eder ) than to replace Oxford-schooled Balletomane Barnes as dance expert , the job for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other possible reasons : many in Manhattan 's theater community resented Barnes ' immense power , and some disliked his tendency to review plays as works of literature rather than live performances . Barnes , 49 , has also starred in local gossip columns concerning some marital problems , and his bosses at the Times were thought to be not amused , a prudishness they deny . " The idea that we 'd tell him how to conduct his personal life is impudent , " bristles Executive Editor A.M. Rosenthal . Though Barnes has lost his Times drama hat , he will continue his weekday theater and dance spots for the paper 's radio station . Says he : " I 've been going to the theater for 40 years ; one does n't give up that sort of thing . " <P> &gt; Shortly after Carll Tucker , a book and theater critic for the Village Voice , turned 25 , his father-in-law , Manhattan Radio Station Owner R. Peter Straus , took him to breakfast to discuss the young man 's future employment prospects . Straus brought along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 in 1940 . Cousins " liked the cut of his jib " and last week found something for young Tucker to do : buy and then edit Saturday Review . The price was from $3 million to $6.5 million , depending on various future expenses , and part of the money comes from the Straus and Tucker families . Cousins , 61 , will stay on as editor for a couple of years as he trains Tucker to succeed him . <P> A 1973 Yale graduate who has written five unpublished novels , Tucker hopes to enliven the magazine 's high-minded mix of essays , reviews and reportage to draw a younger audience . " It 's a damn good magazine with a lot of interesting stuff , " he says , " but it 's always somebody 's aunt who reads it . None of my contemporaries do . I only began reading it after that breakfast . "
