FUNNY LADY <P> Directed by HERBERT ROSS Screenplay by JAY PRESSON ALLEN and ARNOLD SCHULMAN <P> There is no getting around it ; Funny Lady is kind of a kick . <P> It ought not to have been . The movie is a continuation of Barbra Streisand 's first starring vehicle . Like Funny Girl ( 1968 ) , Funny Lady is gaudy and inane . As before , the star cuts up and camps up a revamped biography of Fanny Brice , here and there belting out a tune as if the lyrics were marching orders . Streisand is still more the enthusiastic personality than dexterous actress . She changes costumes faster than moods , and usually tosses off her lines like a rich girl rummaging through a drawer full of last year 's clothes . <P> None of this , as it happens , makes much difference . Neither does a script that draws its inspiration from every stage musical ever mounted , then defies you to care . What can one make of writing that calls for the leading lady to meet her leading man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comment to a friend , " Bobby , this is a shrewd kid " ? There are several possible reactions : get huffy , go with it , or be thankful she does not add " He 'll go far . " Funny Lady repeatedly invites all such responses . The good thing about the movie is the nervy way it proves that they are not mutually exclusive . <P> It may only be that Streisand has worn us down out of sheer volume and stubbornness , but she seems to have mellowed . She does not act quite so much like the stepchild of Ethel Merman who spent summers with Mae West . When she does come on , James Caan is available to perform whatever deflation is necessary . Caan , who plays the flashy Broadway impresario Billy Rose to Streisand 's Brice , stands up well under the painful effulgence of her superstardom . He is a scrappy actor , always looking for an opening , and he finds his full share of them-or makes them . Only Robert Redford in The Way We Were was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by playing off Streisand and cooling her out . Caan goes straight at her , battling for every breath , every inch of screen space . <P> Ingratiating Delirium . If this cockfight between the stars lends the movie its feisty appeal , its wholehearted trafficking in musical cliches imparts an air of ingratiating delirium . There are the usual lavish numbers-including a reproduction of a Billy Rose Aquacade - staged with a satiric glint by Director Herbert Ross ( The Last of Sheila ) . But the best tune in the show is a ballad ( If I Love Again ) , delivered quietly by Streisand as she stands with a song sheet over a piano . The writers have also supplied a fair number of punchy Broadway wisecracks . Says Caan , proposing to Streisand as he flashes a hulking ring : " I paid retail . " <P> The plot , which matters least of all , has to do with Fanny Brice 's later years after her separation from Nicky Arnstein , who did her so bad in the original . Omar Sharif , forever limpid , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny away from Billy , but she rejects him . The ending is an occasion for a few tears and a little heartbreak ; we well know from all the funny ladies of movie history that happiness does not come with success . Only producers might think otherwise , and they keep it to themselves . ? Jay Cocks
