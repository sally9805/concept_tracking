THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON April 20 , 1971 , the Supreme Court announced its decision in the case of Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education  --  the first " busing " case to he ruled on by the Court . The decision was unanimous , and the opinion , which was delivered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , stated that although the judiciary had neither the mandate nor the desire to set a " fixed mathematical racial balance " of white and black students in public schools , government-ordered busing was a proper Constitutional remedy in districts where segregation was officially sanctioned and school authorities offered no other acceptable plan for desegregating . Many Southerners had apparently hoped , and expected , that the Nixon Administration and the Burger Court would eliminate busing , and yet a majority of the people in the South seemed to react calmly and sensibly to the decision . In North Carolina , where the order applied immediately , Jonathan Yardley , an editor of the Greensboro Day NCWS , wrote that summer , " Since May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going to obey the law , we are going to obey it fully , and we are going to obey it in good spirit . " Yardley supported his contention by citing what had happened in Greensboro , where a case like the one in Charlotte had been before a lower federal court at the time of the Supreme Court ruling . Once the ruling had been announced , he wrote , the Greensboro suit was quickly and amicably settled , without the expected " community-wide resistance and school-board recalcitrance . " He went on : From that point , the city was mobilized . Though more than a few white parents fled to the local day school or one of the unaccredited " Christian " academies , by and large the city made clear it would stick with the public schools . Parents , including those from the most affluent white areas , organized trips to the schools where their children were assigned . Most importantly , an organization called Concerned Citizens for Schools was formed ... to focus community sentiment on public education  --  and on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization has been extraordinary ... and it has probably done as much as possible to insure a tranquil and productive period of adjustment . Down to the finest details -- eheerleaders , student government , Hi-Y clubs , football practice  --  arrangements have been made to make a sticky situation , if not wholly comfortable , far less sticky . In other cities  --  Durham , Norfolk , Raleigh  --  much the same has been done . Less than a month after the Supreme Court decision , the government imposed a strict busing plan on the school system of Austin , Texas , and , as the United States Commission on Civil Rights later commented , the plan was " courageously accepted " by local school authorities . However , the decision was not accepted by a federal judge for the district , who rejected it , late in July . About that time , Republican state chairmen from the South met to discuss strategy for the forthcoming election year , and reported afterward to President Nixon that the increase in school desegregation was destroying his Southern base . Other reports indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Wallace , of Alabama , who was clearly preparing to run again for the Presidency , and who had indicated that he intended to make busing his principal campaign issue if he ran . During the summer , Governor Wallace began hitting that issue hard and constantly , and charged the Nixon Administration with having done more than any preceding administration to desegregate public schools . Then , on August 3rd , President Nixon publicly repudiated the Austin plan , which had been approved by both his Attorney General and his Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare . The President also announced that he had ordered them to hold busing " to the minimum required by law " and had asked the Secretary to submit to Congress that same day an amendment to the proposed Emergency School Assistance Act  --  providing a billion and a half dollars to aid schools in the process of desegregating  --  to " expressly prohibit expenditure of any of those funds for busing . " At the time he made the announcement , he said , " I am against busing as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently opposed the busing of our nation 's schoolchildren to achieve a racial balance , and I am opposed to the busing of children simply for the sake of busing . " Of course , the Supreme Court had stated in the Swann case that it was not approving busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance in schools , and no one , except perhaps bus manu-facturers and bus drivers , had ever proposed busing for the sAo. - of hosing . In fact , just about everyone disliked on regretted the use of busing , but in most cases so far no one has devised a more ef-fective method for breaking up un-Constitutional patterns of segregation in public schools , and in some cases no one has devised any other method . ( As it happened , the busing ordered in Charlotte to destroy segregation was less than the busing that had ? been used there to preserve segregation . ) Two days after the President 's statement , Governor Wallace announced that he would run for the Presidency , and attacked Mr. Nixon by telling the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our children just keep on getting bused . " A week later , the Governor ordered that a schoolgirl in Alabama who had to ride twenty-two miles to school by bus be reassigned to a school nearer her home . That made the front pages , and so did a telegram he sent the President demanding support for his campaign to stop busing altogether . Shortly after the telegram reached the White House , Ron Ziegler told reporters there that Mr. Nixon had warned government officials that if they suggested more than the minimum busing required by law they would " find themselves involved in other assignments or quite possibly in assignments other than with the federal government . " In the South , racists were jubilant , whites and blacks who had worked for racial amity were embittered , and school officials were bewildered . In Jackson , Mississippi , for instance , the school hoard had ordered sixty-five new buses , at a cost of nine hundred thousand dollars ( including drivers ' salaries and maintenance costs ) ; it had been promised a federal subsidy to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he withdrawn . Far more important , though , was the effect that the President 's statement had on the millions of people who had finally crone to accept integration as inevitable . " President Nixon did a darn good job of messing things up for us , " James R. ? Johnson , a member of the Jackson school board , said . " People here were finally psyched up to accept busing and integration . But now the President has given fire to the conservatives . " It had taken a hundred years to get that fire under control . " And along comes Mr. Nixon , " Yardley wrote . " In words clearly designed for the most cynical political purposes  --  especially , one supposes , for the votes of the key 1972 state of ' Texas  --  he tells us in effect to ignore or circumvent the law .... The South has come , however slowly , to understand that the law must not be tampered with for political expediency , and it has committed itself to obeying it dutifully . For the President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unconscionable , and a disservice to every Southerner who is working earnestly for racial peace . " In the late nineteen-sixties , lower federal courts began ruling that , since de-facto segregation ( resulting largel ! , from housing patterns ) was fostered and accepted by local officials , it was effectively the same as de-jury segregation ( sanctioned by law ) , and was equally un-Constitutional . Because of such rulings , a substantial number of schools in the North were ordered to begin desegregating last fall , often by way of busing . Naturally , that made the issue a national rather than a sectional one a fact that Mr. Nixon could scarcely have been unaware of when he delivered his anti-busing statement in the summer . Last fall 's protests and riots against busing in the North delighted some Southerners in Congress as they watched their Northern colleagues squirm under anti-busMARCH I 1 1 9 7 2 ing pressure from their constituents . Then , in mid-January , the Supreme Court agreed to consider , in effect , whether dr-facto segregation is the same as de-par segregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the South and from the North had responded to the anti-busing fervor , which Mr. Nixon had done so much to create , by drafting scores of anti-busing bills and anti-busing amendments to the Constitution . Having set off this inflamed reaction , the President poured fuel on it by announcing that he had ordered a stud ) to determine whether legislation or a Constitutional amendment was needed to reverse court decisions that upheld or ordered busing . " My views on busing are well known , " he said at a press conference in early February . " I favor local control of local schools . I oppose busing for the purpose of racial balance .... The problem we have now is that some courts have handed down decisions veluch seem to differ In those views , and so the question arises as to whether legislation or a Constitutional amendment is necessary if we are to see that those views that I have just enunciated can properly he held and implemented . " In an editorial a couple of days later , the Washington Post summarized what the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Supreme Court has never authorized or even ruled on busing for the purpose of racial balance , " that it has strongly hinted its opposition to such busing , that it has very clearly authorized busing and similar measures only for the purpose of overcoming the effects of officially intended racial segregation , and that the lower courts which have been handing down busing orders have been doing so on the same stated grounds . To enact an amendment such as that currently favored by supporters of the move on the Hill could therefore hardly have much effect on a practice that does not even exist and one which the Supreme Court seems unlikely to endorse . What it actually cradd do is throw into new and terribly disruptive litigation much of the progress and achievement the Nixon Administration claims for itself , much of the hard-won success in desegregating school systems formerly segregated by law ; at worst , it could amount to an effective repeal of the Fourteenth Amendment where the schools are concerned . Moreover , repeated statements issued by the White House that the THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Constitutional amendment of his own gave legitimacy to a campaign that had theretofore amounted to little more than a demagogic exercise by members of Congress who were up for reelection . Now , all sides agree , the President 's decision will determine the course of the civil-rights movement for many years . tion ; it derives from acts of Congress , and can be amended am time that Congress chooses ; for that matter , so can the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court . Of course , that kind of extreme reaction on the part of Congress is unlikely , but the alternatives to it are not much better . If anti-busing legislation is enacted and if the courts uphold it , they will he reversing themselves , and thereby admitting that they can he intimidated . That admission would undermine the law , and the people 's respect for it , almost as much as congressional action to change the existing judicial system . Mr. Dooley once remarked that even Supreme Court judges read the election returns . If they do , then lower federal judges must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime tenure , they are exposed to many outside pressures . For one thing , judges live in communities and are subject to all the ordinary social and personal pressures , which at times only the most devoted servant of the law can resist . For another , District Court judges naturally hope to he promoted to the Court of Appeals , and Court of Appeals judges naturally hope to he promoted to the Supreme Court . And , finally , the courts invariably take their lead from the Supreme Court , which has rarely stood op to Congress , let alone to Congress and a President . As Woodrow Wilson observed , " Congress must wantonly go very far outside of the plain and unquestionable mean- ing of the Constitution , must hump its head directly against all right and precedent , must kick against the very pricks of all well-established rulings and interpretations , before the Supreme Court will offer it any distinct rebuke . " If , on the other hand , a Constitutional amendment is adopted , the people will have been encouraged to casually and frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby circumventing the judicial system altogether . That outcome , of course , would transform the rule of law into the rule of men . ? Vhatever the resolution of the crisis , it was unnecessary from the outset , because experience has shown time and again , even in the most implacably resistant parts of the South , that the people 's fear and hatred of busing reach a peak when the system is first put into practice , then rapidly diminish , and eventually all but disappear . This year , though , the President seems determined to keep the people 's fear and hatred at the peak until election time , whatever the cost to the nation 's children and to its laws . Concert at the Point WE went to a pop concert of the peace-and-love variety at West Point one recent Saturday night . It was at once reassuring and slightly disorienting . West Point is a hit over an hour 's drive north of the city , on the west hank of the Hudson . We arrived a little early and stopped for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure just inside the south gate of the United States Military Academy . In the lobby , a warm fire blazed in the fireplace , and cadets lounged with their dates . The cadets wore gray ; their dates were more variously dressed . One young woman , we noticed , had on a long black-and-white gown slit dramatically to the hip . In the hotel coffee shop , downstairs , we asked the girl behind the counter if she was going to the concert . " I 'd like to go , but not with hint , " she said pertly , and glanced at a dejected-looking young man on the other side of the room . " I mean , who wants to go with a straight ? " We took our tray into the next room , where there were a couple of pinball machines . A cadet was hunched over one of them with a friend , and we headed for the other . " Have you got a dime for two nickels ? " asked the friend , who was wearing a black blazer with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button-down shirt , and a tie with gold , black , and gray stripes . We had , and handed it over . " Arc you a cadet , too ? " we asked . " Yes , we 're both plebes . " " And they let you wear civilian clothes ? " " Well , this is a uniform , too . " " All , " we said , and we looked down at our own double-breasted suit . " What made you decide to go to West Point ? " " Sometimes I wonder , " he said . " All my friends back home are freaks with hair down to here . But it 's free , and it 's a good education , and I come from a military family . " " The main thing , " the other cadet said , " is that we 're normal people , too . " We headed for the concert , which was being held in the Field House , a building larger than a football field . Bleachers and folding chairs had been set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewise into the gigantic building , the feeling was one of surprising intimacy . Most of the chairs  --  there were roughly two thousand of them  --  were occupied by cadets and their dates , and most of the cadets were in gray , but a fair number were wearing black blazers with crests on the pockets , gray trousers , white button-down shirts , and ties with gold , black , and gray stripes . Upon inquiring , we found that the young man at the pinball machine had not been making a philosophical point when he said he was in uniform . The main attraction was the folk singer Melanie , but the concert opened with a set by a duo called fancy and Dennis . Janet ' wore a long homespun dress and Dennis was all but invisible behind a cloud of hair , and the cadets enjoyed their performance . Their last song was about a steamboat called the Robert E. Lee . " Class of 1829 , " Lieutenant Colonel Patrick H. Dionne , the Academy 's information officer , told us . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably why they 're cheering . " After an intermission , Melanie appeared . Melanie , whose full name is Melanie Safka Schekeryk , is a young singer-composer . She is twenty-five years old . She grew up in Manhattan and in Bayside , Queens , and Long Branch , New Jersey . She has made six record albums , consisting almost entirely of her own songs , which are dramatic and emotionally charged , sometimes verging on the sentimental . From the first , she has been wildly popular among young girls , who still crowd hut concerts , bringing homemade gifts with them to deposit reverently on the stage and lighting candles when she sings " Candles in the Rain , " one of her most popular songs . Her music does not fit the usual categories ; it 's not belligerent enough to he rock , it 's ton lush to he folk , and it 's too straightforward to he art song . She has never been taken very seriously by the pop critics , but the rest of the world seems to think highly of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General Assembly at the United Nations staff party , and later this year UNICEF will send her around the world . The cadets liked her . She was wearing a long dress of many colors of velvet  --  mostly mustard , red , and blue . She has a pretty face with broad , Slavic features , and it peeked out from under a mass of dark hair as she sang . After her first song , she said , " Would you like to clap along , in strict time , to this next song ? " and the cadets laughed . After she had sung for about an hour , she said , " I think a good point was MARCH 119 1972 made by asking me here . Well , I got something to say to make the point a little more obvious . This is a new song . I just wrote it a few days ago . I did n't know I was going to do this , but I got a feeling I was supposed to sing it here for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We jotted down some of the words : Hearing the news ai n't like being there . Hearing the news makes it easier . Nothing seems real unless it 's happening to you . And because we do n't know 1,17e try and understand . And because we do n't know We hurt our fellow-man . And because we do n't know We 're fitting in the plan . There are people who are living on the death in the land . The audience gave Melanie a standing ovation . Afterward , she climbed a flight of metal steps at one side of the Field House to a locker room , and members of the Dialectic Society , a cadet theatrical group , which had sponsored the concert , followed to thank her . The cadets shyly posed for pictures with her . On a blackboard in the locker room was this note : DEAR MELANIE : May we please have your autograph ? THE ARMY BASKETBALL TEAM Melanie wrote her name on the blackboard . Colonel Dionne said , " Write ' Beat Rutgers ' on there , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable , but she wrote " Beat Rutgers " in tiny letters at the bottom of the blackboard . A tall , skinny cadet emerged from the crush around Melanie carrying a photograph and wearing a beatific expression . We asked if we might have a look . On the picture Melanie had written " For Ed , with love . Melanie . " Under her signature she had drawn a flower . " Nice , " we said . " Yeah , " the cadet said . " Heavy . " Westward SINCE its birth as a network pro-SINCE gram in September , 1954 , " Tonight " has become something of a local landmark and tourist attraction as well as a continuing national advertisement for the city . But now , as of the first of May , " Tonight , " like the middle class and the New York football Giants , is moving to the suburbs  --  all the way to Burbank , California  --  and we are sorry to see it go . When we heard about the move the other day , we called N.B.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson , who is now in his THE NEW YORKER tenth year as the " Tonight " host . On the appointed afternoon , we went up to the R.C.A. Building , where we were greeted by an N.B.C . public-relations man . He took us to the seventh floor , steered us down a long corridor , and stopped at a locked door . He unlocked the door and pushed it open , revealing another long corridor . " Security , " the p.r . man said , smiling . " We get a few burglaries these days . " At the end of the second corridor , the . p.r . man stopped at an unmarked door that looked as though it might lead into a closet . But inside was a small , softly lighted office containing two young secretaries . Beyond them was another closed door , and beyond that was a larger office  --  Mr. Carson 's  --  which looked more like a living room than an office . It was decorated in blue and tan , and was furnished with a sofa , two easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , and a rotund marble-top table . Mr. Carson , wearing brown slacks and a gold turtleneck sweater , was seated at the round table going through his mail . As soon as we had said hello and taken a seat , we asked Mr. Carson why he was leaving the city . " It has nothing to do with New York City , " he told us . " I dig New York . It 's still the center of everything . But when you have to do that show five nights a week the talent pool gets a little thin . Of course , you have Broadway , but practically all of television has moved to the West Coast , and much of the talent lives there . So it 's a change that I think will help the show . " We said that we had watched " Tonight " off and on ever since its Steve Allen days , that it had always seemed to us to have a New York atmosphere , and that we wondered if losing that might not he a disadvantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York atmosphere for the show anymore , " Mr. Carson said . " I think the show makes its own atmosphere , wherever it is . But , any way , I do n't think that matters now . It used to be you 'd say , ' And now , direct from New York City , ' and it was exciting to people out there . You know , you 'd have re- ? ? motes  --  Arthur Godfrey in Miami , and they 'd show a pool , and people would think , Wow , it 's from Miami ! But it 's just different now . That does n't impress them anymore . I do n't think there are any rubes left . People are so much more sophisticated . They get live programs from all over the world , by satellite . So you 're not going to impress them by broadcasting from New York . Those days are over . " " Well , there are plenty of movie stars out there , but what about new talent ? " we said . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , were unknown comedians , working in clubs in the Village . Will you he able to find new talent like that in Hollywood ? " " Again , I think it 's a different era , " Mr. Carson said . " It 's nice to say you 're going to go to these terrific little clubs and discover new talent , but where in the hell are they ? How many of those places are left ? Night life in New York City , when you come right down to it , has not been good for years . " " Will the show 's entire staff make the move ? " we asked . " Most of those who want to go will go , " Mr. Carson said . " The principals.3I Doc Severinsen , Ed McMahon . The producers . The director . They 're all looking forward to it . For one thing , the physical facilities for the production of television shows are better out there . This building was n't built for television . It was built for radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to he made somewhere else and brought here in trucks . Out there , it 's done across the hall . " We asked Mr. Carson whether the hardships of city life had influenced his decision to go West . " Not really , " he said . " We make jokes about it  --  about the crime , and other problems  --  but New York has always been pretty much the way it is now . And some cities have even worse problems . " " Will you miss the city at all ? " we asked . " Absolutely , " Mr. Carson said . " But it 's not as though I could never come to New York . It 's just five and a half hours away . And we 'll bring the show here for visits , the way we used to visit California . But , as I said , it 's not so much where you arc ; it 's whether the work is going all right . If the show is going well , everything else falls into place . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
