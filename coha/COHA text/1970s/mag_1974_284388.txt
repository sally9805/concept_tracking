" I smell defeat , " said pro-monarchist George Geogeoppulos , a retired army officer , after seeing the first returns . Defeat it was . By an unequivocal margin of 69.2% , Greece voted to abolish the monarchy that has ruled the country since 1833 . At his home near London , exiled King Constantine , 34 , disconsolately watched the televised election results mount against him . Meanwhile , thousands of his jubilant countrymen converged on Athens ' Constitution Square to celebrate the birth of their nation as an " uncrowned democracy . " Constantine now joins the small but select group of unemployed European monarchs ( see box ) . In a brief statement of concession to his former subjects , he prayed " that future developments may justify the outcome " of their vote . <P> Most Greeks felt , however , that the King 's past performance offered sufficient justification for their action . During his brief active reign ( 1964-67 ) Constantine displayed the royal penchant for political highhandedness that has troubled Greece for much of its modern history . To resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , he simply dismissed liberal Prime Minister George Papandreou from office , even though Papandreou had won a landslide election victory the previous year . None of the five caretaker Cabinets that Constantine then appointed proved capable of resolving the political chaos that followed Papandreou 's ouster-a situation that eventually led to the 1967 military coup . <P> The indecisiveness that characterized Constantine 's dealing with the hated junta , the failure of his attempt to dislodge the colonels in December of 1967 , and the silence he maintained for most of his seven years in exile further eroded what sentiment remained for restoring the King to power . During the prereferendum campaign , Constantine emphasized his willingness to accept a purely ceremonial role as constitutional monarch . The voters , however , were not inclined to trust a man whom many still hold responsible for the bitter experience of the past seven years . <P> Gaullist Inspiration . The Greek Parliament , which began meeting last week for the first time since 1967 , must now fashion a new constitution for the republic . Premier Constantine Caramanlis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , has proposed a Gaullist-inspired system of presidential government , with strong consolidation of power in one office . If Parliament approves his draft constitution , as it is expected to do within the next three months , another election will be held . Whether the President is elected by Parliament or through a national plebiscite , a Caramanlis victory is certain .
