Undeterred by an unseasonal dusting of snow , Emperor Hirohito and several other members of the imperial family trooped into their private box last week as the strains of Kimi-ga-yo , Japan 's national anthem , wafted over the Senri Hills near Osaka . While multicolored flags and paper cranes swirled about them in the brisk breezes , cannons boomed a five-gun salute and a 100-piece orchestra blared Fanfare of the 21st Century , a piece specially written by composer Masaru Sato . Then two giant robots clanked into Festival Plaza , disgorging 110 members of a children 's band who launched into the Expo March . Japan 's gaudy Expo ' 70 was officially under way . <P> World 's fairs have been a Western fixture ever since Britain 's Prince Albert staged his Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851 . But this-astonishingly-is the first world 's fair ever to be held in Asia . The site is eminently suitable . Japan , all but crushed at the end of World War II , has far outdistanced every Asian nation , and most of those in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into third place ( behind the U.S. and the Soviet Union ) among the world 's industrial giants . Gaudy , opulent , bursting at the seams , Expo ' 70 stands as the supreme symbol of Japan 's growing self-confidence and strength . <P> At least , that is how its hosts feel about it . " Subarashii terrific ! " said Prime Minister Eisaku Sato , after a pre-opening tour . " This is not a statement of the 20th century but one of the 21st -a good expression of our national power . " <P> Animals No More . Two years of intensive preparations and more than $2 billion ( a large part of it for new roads , subways and housing to handle the mobs ) have gone into Expo . " Why not ? " asked Taizo Ishizaka , president of the Japan Expo Association . " Once in a blue moon , we Japanese must indulge in one colossal binge . " Another Japanese businessman , commenting on the cost , predicted : " Nobody outside Japan is going to call us economic animals any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent so much for such a thing . " <P> Seventy-seven countries and one colony ( Hong Kong ) have pavilions on the 815-acre Expo site . The U.S. exhibit , catering to the baseball-mad Japanese , features Babe Ruth 's uniform , a lunar module and a genuine moon rock . The Russians are showing the two Soyuz rockets that docked in space in 1969 , as well as a replica of the elegant 19th century room of Composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky , complete with his actual grand piano . <P> Fair officials say they expect 50 million Japanese ( roughly half the country 's population ) as well as 1,000,000 foreigners to visit Expo . Japanese police are ready to offer a special greeting to 203 guests-internationally known pickpockets whose biographies and photos have been supplied by Interpol ; the police are also on the lookout for 482 outstanding locals . <P> New Version . What worries officials most of all , though , is the prospect of horrendous traffic jams and an acute shortage of hotel rooms . The Osaka area is heavily booked and even the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tokyo , 250 miles north , is jammed as well .
