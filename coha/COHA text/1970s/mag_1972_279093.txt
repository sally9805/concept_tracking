AFTER AFL-CIO Boss George Meany and three other union leaders stormed off the Pay Board in March rumbling that Phase II rules are stacked against workers , it seemed that the U.S. might be in for a new period of labor turmoil . The exact opposite has happened ; 1972 so far shapes up as the year that the nation 's strike fever was broken . In May , work stoppages reached a 30-year low for the month . During the first six months , production time lost to strikes was only five seconds out of each potential man-hour of work , or little more than half the rate a year ago . In only four full years since World War II has the strike pace been slower . <P> Administration officials believe that the absence of costly , wasteful strikes is a key reason for the nation 's surge of economic growth . In one sense , 1972 was almost bound to be a quieter labor year than 1970 or 1971 . The number of workers whose contracts come up for renewal this year is only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past two years . But employers , some local union officials and mediators agree that a new and less militant psychology is also at work in labor bargaining . <P> Says Washingtonian Guy Farmer , a frequent adviser to management negotiators : " We simply have a more peaceful labor scene . " The standout reason is that paychecks are finally keeping ahead of inflation . In the years just before 1972 , ever-fatter wage settlements negotiated by unions were all but canceled by increases in the cost of living , keeping the actual buying power of U.S. workers just about level and breeding bitter discontent in the factory . By contrast , real earnings have inched ahead about 3.2% in the past four quarters ( see story , page 53 ) . In effect , a drop in the inflation rate has made the smaller increases that labor can achieve without strikes in 1972 worth more than the bigger gains won by striking in prior years . Government intervention has also helped mightily to cool tempers . Federal efforts began in April 1971 , with formation of the Construction Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the building industry 's then-chaotic labor relations . Its existence has given local leaders an excuse to justify moderate demands to militant members . In addition , the committee chairman , Harvard Economist John Dunlop , has demonstrated considerable skill in negotiating with both sides . In 1970 , work stoppages preceded the signing of 30% of all new construction contracts ; in the first half of 1972 the rate fell to 9% . Moreover , construction wage increases have dropped off from a horrendously inflationary 15.3% to 5.7% . A few unions have settled for even less . Plumbers in Washtenaw County , Mich. , recently signed a contract providing no increase whatever in their already-high $10.17 hourly rate .
