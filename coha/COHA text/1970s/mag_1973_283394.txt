AMERICAN MISCHIEF by ALAN LELCHUK 501 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $8.95 . <P> For those who missed the pre-publication publicity , Alan Lelchuk 's American Mischief is the novel in which Norman Mailer is shot to death by a young radical intellectual who obviously read An American Dream but forgot to close the cover before striking . <P> Mailer was outraged by the scene in which a character bearing his name , rank and serial number was shot by a punk recruit . Furthermore , the bullet was fired into the very end of his digestive tract from a range that politely can only be called pointblank . At a meeting of lawyers and publishers , Mailer offered to reduce Lelchuk to " a hank of hair and some fillings . " That literary phrase turned out to be a pretty good description of the novel itself . <P> Despite selection by the Book-of-the-Month Club and advance compliments from Lelchuk 's friend Philip Roth , American Mischief is not much more than another exploitive , topical novel . Lelchuk romps through the confusions and contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratuitous looter in a cultural disaster area . <P> Ground zero is Boston and its environs , which Lelchuk turns into a combination Sodom and St. Petersburg on the eve of the Russian Revolution . His characters even faction off nicely into modern American equivalents of Mensheviks , Bolsheviks and Nihilists , with Lenny Pincus , a subway Trotsky from Brooklyn , hopelessly trying to keep two feet in all three camps . <P> Pincus is an ex-student at Cardoza College ( read Brandeis , where Lelchuk teaches English ) . But the first half of the book belongs to Pincus ' former teacher Bernard Kovell , the school 's 35-year-old humanities dean . By day Kovell is the model liberal , upholding the life of the mind and responsibility to the commonweal . By night he juggles his " family " of six girl friends . Most of the girls have an illustrative neurosis . But after more than 100 pages of Kovell 's describing his curative powers in tedious Deep Throat detail , it is time to reconsider H.L. Mencken 's endorsement of monogamy as convenient and hygienic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seems satisfied with joylessly initiating one 14-year-old virgin and watching her take up with heroin . Pincus ' passion is for revolution and cultivating flowers of evil from all the standard humanities-department seed catalogues . He is an organizer of the destruction of art in local museums and the burning of Harvard 's Widener Library . He kills Mailer , further extending those justifications for hell raising that Mailer himself borrowed from Dostoevsky , Baudelaire , et al . <P> The next step for Pincus and his guerrilla band of young suburban terrorists and ghetto scholarship dropouts is to kidnap ten of the nation 's leading intellectuals . Here Lelchuk plays it safe by identifying them only as A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I and Kovell . The plan is to " de-mandarinize " the elders at a secret New Hampshire hideout . This promising situation is not fulfilled with much imagination or wit . Pincus ' fate is equally drab : prison , where he is reduced to suffering from a chronic earache.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
