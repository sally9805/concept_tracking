txt In a city of relatively few high buildings , Centre Point stands out as a skyscraper . The 32-story tower in the bustling West End probably is London 's tallest , most spectacular and potentially most profitable office building . Also the emptiest . As a matter of fact , since the building was completed in 1965 , it has n't had a single tenant . " I feel very sad that it 's empty , " says Richard Seifert , Centre Point 's architect . " A building deteriorates , in an esthetic sense , when it 's not occupied . " Others say Centre Point is deteriorating in more ordinary ways . Because of disuse , they contend , the air-conditioning system no longer flari  --  tinns. , and the cost of the neglected interior may run to $2 million . The building is n't vacant for any of the obvious reasons that explain why imposing structures sornc-drnPg become white elephants . Unlike in New York City , for instance , there is n't a glut of office space in central London . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-estate men say London 's rents accordingly are the highest in the world . Office space in the West End rents for the equivalent of $15 to $20 a square foot . And it 's even costlier in the city , as London 's financial district is called . Negotiations That Failed Nor is Centre Point unattractive to would-be tenants . Located at the busy intei-=.1 ? tinn of Oxford Street , Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road , the building has been sought as a headquarters by such important % ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - as British Steel Corp . and EMI Ltd. , the big international entertainment group . But in every case , the negotiations broke down . The landlord asked for too much rent or insisted that the tenant make pre-occupancy repairs or demanded that one tenant let the entire building , its top-story restaurant , 36 adjoining duplex apartments , 114111. ? , 111 shops and a 150-car garage . Different reasons have been offered  --  but the building is still empty . " If you talk to eight people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still uniet , " says Oliver Marriott , a financial journalist . The one man who knows is Harry J. Hyams  --  and he is n't offering any explpnntinwa Mr. Hyams , Centre Point 's mysterious owner , is a 43-year-old property tycoon whose penchant for secrecy has made him known as " the Howard Hughes of British business . " Mr. Hyams wo n't discuss Centre Point or any of his business dealings . Neither he nor his staff answers mail on the subject . The London Stock Exchange says it halted trading in Mr. Ilyams ' closely held public-property company this year because of his failure to disclose sufficient financial Information . Mum 's the Best Word Secrecy , however , has proved the best policy for Mr. Hyams . At the time trading in his company 's shares was halted , they had a market value of about $300 million , with his 40% personal stake worth $120 million . Secrecy is at the heart of the entire Centre Point deal  --  and explains gsnrni.thing about how business is conducted , and how fortunes are made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when London 's municipal council decided to alter the traffic-clogged int. **RPctirm where Centre Point now stands by clearing old buildings on the site and making a traffic circle . But some landowners got word and held out for more money than the city authorities could afford . Then a solution was presented to the planning committee by its lawyer , now Lord Goodman , who also happened to be Mr. Hyams ' lawyer . Mr. Hyams would buy all the property and present it to the local government for its traffic circle , known here as a roundabout . In return , the London council would permit Mr. Hyams to build a skyscraper on a traffic island and in the air rights above the roundabout . This proposal was gladly accepted , and Mr. Hyams ' was granted some , highly favorable concessions . First , the building was permitted about double the office space of comparable sites . Then , the council granted Mr. Hyams a 150-year lease at about $45,000 a year , without any provision for an upward revision . Mr. Marriott and others regard this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose $30 ' million in - ( Ironically , the traffic-pattern plan that provided the impetus for the transaction was abandoned , and the traffic circle under Centre Point has never been used . ) Other factors in London 's real-estate picture apparently . will make it extremely profitable for Mr. Hyams to keep Centre Point unoccupied . The Labor in 1964 banned construction of . more offices in central London in an effort to t'r , " ournge business firma to relocate outside the crowded metropolitan area . But , with the resulting tight supply of office space , rents have been driven continually higher . Another factor is a curious provision in the property-tax regulations . At one : time it held that rates , or municipal taxes , were n't due on unoccupied premises . Largely because of Centre Point , this law was later dad to make an owner liable for half the rates ; since 1888 , Mr. Hyams has been paying about $276 , - 000 annually . When the building is let , of course , Mr. Hyams wo n't have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation under British law . No one suggests that Mr. Hyams is n't acting entirely , within his legal rights in demanding a rental above the market or in otherwise setting conditions that are making Centre Point Britain 's tallest empty house . But there are critics . " Where is the social justification if it 's more profitable to keep the building empty than rented ? " asks Kenneth Blessley , a tax valuer for the Greater London council . " It's- all perfectly legal , but it 's being done at great taxpayer expense . " With London still suffering from an acute housing shortage , Mr. Hyams also , must provide constant security - such as private guards accompanied by watchdogs , to defend the building against a threatened live-in by squatters . Most property experts suggest that Mr. Hyams , with a huge real-estate empire , is using all these expenses to offset his income taxes . Meanwhile , the tight rental market in London apparently assures him of a higher profit the longer Centre Point is off the market . Some valuers estimate that if Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring in $30 million profit . Real-estate ' experts , however , believe that the Tory g . t may be easing restrictions on new office space , in London 's tight market and that ' rentals may be leveling off , even though no more than 1% or 2% of . the 187 million square feet of office space are available : " It might yet become a little bit of an emba .. t to have an =let Centre Point , " says Arnold Hammond , a real-estate man . - And in the near future Centre Point undoubtedly will lose some of its aura . An even bigger building by Mr. Seifert , who is acknowledged to be Britain 's most ful c cial architect , is ' under was ' .
