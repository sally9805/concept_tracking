One of the lessons of history is that art is a better preservative than Formalin , and sweeter smelling , too . Even if the patron is an outright criminal while alive , he seems , after he dies , to take on the noble and decorative character of the works of art that he bought . <P> One of the most notable examples was a prodigiously wealthy , vain and talented son of a French king , Jean , the Duke of Berry . Jean de Berry was born in 1340 , and his patronage of artists changed the whole pattern of late medieval painting . " No patron of his time , and few before or after him , had a comparable effect on the arts , " wrote Art Historian Millard Meiss . " Between 1380 and 1400 every great cycle of miniatures in France was commissioned by the Duke of Berry . " A superb exhibition of 14th and 15th century French miniature painting , organized by Professor Meiss , is now on view at Manhattan 's Pierpont Morgan Library . Inevitably , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Even by aristocratic standards , Jean de Berry 's appetite for possessions was extreme . He liked animals ; so his menagerie included 50 swans , a wolf , a camel , an ostrich , 1,500 mastiffs , and a number of tame bears which , lurching along in specially designed carts , followed the duke on his frequent moves between chteaux . As with beasts , so with priests : " He maintained in his home , " wrote one chronicler , " many chaplains who day and night sang the praises of God and celebrated Mass , and he took care to compliment them whenever the service lasted longer or was more elaborate than usual . " <P> Holy Grail . This conspicuous piety also inspired a large collection of relics , including the mummified corpse of one of the Holy Innocents slain by King Herod , fragments of nails used in the Crucifixion , and the chalice from which Christ supposedly drank at the Last Supper . <P> The Duke of Berry 's belief in a connection between riches and virtue was quite like J.

The result was a triumph of manic connoisseurship-the greatest private collection in Europe . <P> One part of it was a library of rather more than 300 manuscripts , many illuminated by artists whom the duke retained at court . Today , book illustration is considered a minor art . In medieval France , these tiny images stippled on vellum were considered the most important form of painting .
