Rusty Staub of the Detroit Tigers is a creature of habits , routines and quirks . He believes they help make him a successful designated hitter . Everyone else thinks they make him a successful DH who is also a little , uh , weird . But , really now , what 's so weird about traveling with your own bottled water , or taking a 90-minute nap before every game , or wearing one pair of gloves for batting and another for running the bases ? // What really sets Staub apart from most other players is his hitting . The 34-year-old lefthanded swinger from New Orleans is in his 16th season and with his fourth team , and he currently ranks in the top five among active players in hits , doubles and RBIs . A rightfielder until he went to the Tigers from the Mets in 1976 , Staub is now the consummate designated hitter . He hit .295 in 36 games as a DH ( and .299 overall ) in 1976 . Last year he had the DH job full time and hit .278 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs ( 84 ) and hits ( 173 ) . This season he has been even better . Staub leads all DHs with a .298 average ( the league average is .254 ) , well ahead of runner-up Jim Rice , who is batting .284 when DH-ing and .340 when playing in the outfield . Staub is even challenging Rice for the league RBI lead , trailing the Boston slugger 96-95 . " We 're like the tortoise and the hare , " says Staub . " I can get one or two RBIs a game , but with his power Rice can get 20 in a week . He must have had some kind of physical problem , or we would n't be this close . " // In truth , the tortoise has had problems of his own this year , particularly a sore back . Before each game Staub 's back is rubbed with liniment , and he is strapped in a tight elastic corset . Nonetheless , he has played in all 114 of the Tigers ' games , and has been conspicuously slump-free . Rusty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has failed to reach base via a hit or a walk in only 11 games . He has driven in 46 runs in the last 45 games , of which the Tigers have won 29 . They now are in third place in the East , 10 games behind Boston . // " I 'm a grind-it-out person , " Staub says . " I 've got to work harder than the next guy to get the same results . If I did n't realize that , I 'd have been out of the game a long time ago . That 's what I try to impress on the younger players : if you understand yourself , if you know what you can and ca n't do , then you 've got a chance . You can adjust and compensate . " // Staub learned the lesson the hard way . After just one season of minor league ball , he became a regular with Houston in 1963 and batted .224 . In half a big league season the following year , he hit .216 . He did not start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a hot streak lifted his average to .256 . Over the past 13 years , Staub has averaged .290 and shown occasional home-run power ( a high of 30 with Montreal in 1970 , when he became known as Le Grand Orange and rivaled Jean Beliveau for popularity in Canada , and 19 so far this year ) . Staub would certainly be a career .300 hitter if he had just a little speed , but he comes out of the batter 's box as if he were mired in quicksand . // " When I first came up , I saw myself as a long-ball hitter , " he says . " I was a dumbnagle . After 2 ? years I finally said to myself , ' Hey , dummy , you want to go back to the minors ? ' No ? Then hit to left sometimes . ' " // This is only one of the techniques that Staub has tried to pass on to young teammates such as First Baseman Jason Thompson and Leftfielder Steve Kemp , both of whom also bat left . Kemp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , says , " I 'm a better hitter because of Rusty . He teaches you to hit your pitch . To make contact without trying to kill the ball . To stay in control . " All of this is fine with Manager Ralph Houk , who says , " If a young player wants to learn how to hit , all he has to do is watch Rusty Staub. " // It is the development of these young Tiger players that has made Staub the team 's permanent DH , a role he regards with mixed feelings . " I told Ralph last year that I did n't like it and I did n't think I deserved it , " Staub says , " but I also said I would try to be the best DH I could . Instead of fighting it , I 'm assuming it . But I am smart enough to realize that by doing it now , it will add years to my career . " // For Staub this is an important consideration because he figures he has a good shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday against the White Sox , Staub was 674 short , but if he bangs out as many hits from 1978 to 1982 as he did from 1973 to 1977 , he will make it before he turns 39 . Says Staub , who has never had a 200-hit season and is not likely to come close to one , " If I stay injury free I think I can do it . That 's why I work my tail off to stay in shape . " // Staub keeps in condition year-round . He plays racquet ball and runs for 20 minutes almost every day during the winter . During the season he runs as often as he can before heading for the park , and then performs stretching exercises and does push-ups once he arrives . No wonder he needs a nap . Three times a week he does elaborate hand and wrist exercises after a game to tone his forearm muscles . // Staub 's quirks are most evident in his routines before and during games . He girds himself with knee pads and ankle tape and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily recognized , and not just for his bright-red hair . Staub does not look like the other guys . For batting practice , instead of baseball shoes and a regular uniform top he wears rubber-soled shoes and a dark-blue warmup jacket with the right sleeve cut off near the shoulder . Instead of following the current fashion of wearing uniform pants with legs low enough to meet the top of high-stirrup socks , his pants legs extend to just below the knee and his stirrups are short , exposing very little of the white sanitary hose underneath . // Staub is also not a typical ballplayer once he gets in the batting cage . He stands in front of the plate , well outside the batter 's box , and he uses a ponderous 38-ounce bat . Instead of just swinging freely , he practices game situations : hit and run , sacrifice fly , opposite field . // Before the game begins , Staub changes into dry clothes ( replacing one obscene T shirt with another ) and puts on his regular uniform jersey and spikes . He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it near the bat rack , not in it . At the plate , he stands as far forward as possible and as close to the plate as he can . He chokes up and hits with a quick , compact swing . And hit he does . " With a man in scoring position , there 's no one I fear more , " says Texas First Baseman Mike Hargrove. // If Staub gets on base , he exchanges his lighter , softer , more expensive gloves for a heavier , more durable pair . If he makes an out , the bat boy is under instruction to hand him the bat so he can return it to the dugout himself  --  a penance , one supposes . // Between appearances at the plate , Staub often returns to the clubhouse , where he either watches the game on television or listens to it on the radio . He may also jump rope or , if he is particularly upset with himself and wants to clear his mind , work on a crossword puzzle . // " The toughest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being mentally prepared to hit . I 'm a very intense person and if I mess up I need something to take my mind off it . I used to be able to do that by playing defense , but not now . That 's why crossword puzzles are so helpful . " // Which brings us , finally , to this question : Does anyone know two five-letter words that mean red-haired , good-hitting eccentric ? Rusty Staub ? That 's it . That 's it exactly .
