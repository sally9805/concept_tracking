FIRST-TIME visitors to Europe are usually impressed by something that its citizens now take for granted-the pervasive signs of economic growth and prosperity . London , Paris , Milan and Frankfurt are cacophonous with construction and clogged with cars . An international network of autostradas , Autobahnen and autoroutes links the Continent 's major ( and even minor ) cities . In winter , such fashionable ski resorts as Gstaad , Chamonix and St. Moritz are booked solid ; in summer , there is a mass migration from Europe 's colder climes to such resorts as the Costa Brava and the Costa del Sol , as well as to ( almost ) unspoiled beaches on Sardinia and Yugoslavia 's Adriatic coast . <P> Europe , in short , looks prosperous and to a large extent is prosperous . And it is no longer only the privileged who share the wealth . A decade ago , a skilled worker in France , Germany , Italy or Belgium was likely to have ridden a bicycle or motorbike to work . Today he owns-or is saving to buy-a Volkswagen , Fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV set ( black-and-white , not color ) . He almost certainly has a savings account ; and if he is lucky , he lives with his family in new , subsidized housing-architecturally undistinguished , but more comfortable than picturesque squalor . <P> Europe , of course , is not yet paradise . The Continent still lags well behind the U.S. by the standard measures of wellbeing , but is catching up ( see charts ) . Income is still distributed inequitably , with many poor people within the richer member countries of the Common Market and widespread chronic poverty in the poorer nations of Italy , Britain and Ireland . All too many homes in the slums of Glasgow lack baths and hot water , and in France thousands of working-class families can afford meat only once or twice a week . Throughout the Common Market , however , social benefits help to compensate for low incomes . Medical services are free , or virtually free ; family allowances ( $65 a month for three children in Belgium , for example ) help to feed and clothe the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is efficient , cheap and lavishly subsidized by U.S. standards . To be sure , none of those and other benefits are really free , since they are paid for by a complex of income and indirect taxes . <P> The extent to which the average European 's economic dreams remain unrealized was quite apparent last week . In Italy , 10 million workers walked away from their jobs for periods ranging from 15 minutes to 24 hours . In France , a strike by air traffic controllers went into its second week , grounding virtually all civil aviation . Britain was crippled by strikes and slowdowns that halted trains , cut gas supplies to some homes and factories and closed schools in London . <P> The issue that brought out the strikers , from Milan to Manchester : living costs that are rising faster than wages . Consumer prices in the Common Market as a whole rose some 8% last year , compared with 3.3% in the U.S. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) warns that this year prices could rise by as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
