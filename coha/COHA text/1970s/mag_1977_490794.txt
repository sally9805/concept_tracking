THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND of ours writes as follows : We all have our ways of placating the betrayed past as we ease into the future . For example , when television first became popular , my grandfather , who was not short of cash , and whose life was devoted to pleasing the eye , chose instead of buying a television set to accept a castoff that had a bullet hole in the middle of the thick glass which covers the screen . It was a neat hole , with a halo of tiny , cobwebby cracks . One could not look at this set without imagining the scene in which someone had picked up a gun and fired at it . No program that one might watch on this television could compete with that scene . The bullet hole made everything that appeared on the set look insipid , if not ludicrous  --  as in the case of newscasters and heroines , who carried on unaware that they had a hole in the head . It also gave the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aura of deep disgrace . Sometime in the past , the set had committed an unpardonable offense , and though it had survived , it was doomed to carry an advertisement of its own outrageousness forever . On these terms , my grandparents and I accommodated ourselves to the age of television . A more recent example concerns the gift of a Cuisinart to my friend Constance . A Cuisinart , as you may know , is a slick , very expensive modern kitchen appliance that cuts up vegetables at an unbelievable speed . It cuts up vegetables so fast that it makes people feel silly . A hollow plastic cylinder protrudes from the flat plastic lid of a rounded clear-plastic container that sits on the base . If you put some carrots in the cylinder and press lightly on a little plastic presser , the carrots are in thin slices splattered around the bottom of the container . Instantly . The carrots are whole and on top ; the carrots are somewhere else all sliced up . It 's irrational . There is no transition , no reas swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the passage in Muriel Spark 's novel " Robinson " in which the heroine goes into somebody 's study while he is away . Feeling a little nervous , not knowing what she is doing there , she picks up his eyeglasses and idly puts them on  --  whereupon all the books fly out of the bookcase . The reader 's inference that the books ' flying out of the bookcase had something to do with the spectacles  --  actually , there had been an earthquake at that very moment  --  has several names . I like to call it the Fallacy of Concomitant Variations . The action of the Cuisinart upon the carrots makes one feel like a dupe of the Fallacy of Concomitant Variations . The fact that it is not an illusion only renders it more shocking to the common sense of a person who has not become hardened to it . The rude efficiency of the Cuisinart was one reason Constance resisted admitting it into her home . A second reason was that , as its name suggests , the machine is associated with a racy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harking hack to a country childhood , has always favored a cozy kind of cooking . Actually , she confided to me , she would prefer a KitchenAid . An old-fashioned Kitchen-Aid electric mixer . There was one in her grandmother 's kitchen ; it had been there for years , and there had never been a thing wrong with it . " I like to bake , " said Constance militantly , be-cause she was under growing pressure from her boyfriend , who likes racy cooking , to accept the Cuisinart . He had lined up a string of Cuisinart lobbyists , one of whom , a new owner , had raved repeatedly about something she had made in the machine called " duxelles . " Constance spoke the word with scorn . " It 's some kind of mushroom butter , " she said . " What are you supposed to do with a thing like that ? " Her boyfriend said he had heard that it was wonderful for " stretching eggs . " Constance hooted , and said , " That certainly sounds economical . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headway , had also told ecstatically of how she had used the Cuisinart to make cupcakes . This had served only to further reinforce Constance 's opinion of the Cuisinart as ridiculous , " You do n't have to pay two hundred and twenty-five dollars to make cupcakes , " she said . " You can make cupcakes in any thing . " The next time I visited Constance , she took me immediately to her kitchen . Without consulting her , her boyfriend had gone to pick up the Cuisinart , and , knowing that it was the only condition under which she would accept it , had at the same time bought a KitchenAul . The two machines stood side by side , taking up two-thirds of her counter space . Alone , either would have been neutral and fairly uninteresting , but in conjunction they summoned up a silent , uncompromising war between two entirely different worlds . The KitchenAid reminded one of a nineteen-forties Oldsmobile . It was heavy and rounded , at once motherly and powerful-looking , its shape serenely functional and suggesting a long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dutifulness , of readiness to go to work but only when asked . In comparison , the Cuisinart looked vain , high-strung , and predatory , and much too eager to prove how smart it was . Those few parts of it whose shape followed their function , such as the plastic cylinder on top , were dinky , giving it an air of here today and gone tomorrow . The heavy base exuded power , but , perhaps because of the lightness of the parts on top , it was a willful , unbalanced kind of power . It gave no sign of loyalty . Clearly , it would as soon chop up you as your mushrooms . The KitchenAid made you think of roomy country houses , of the smell of something baking in the afternoon , of coming in out of the snow , of children . It made you think of cooking as generosity , as an integral part of a texture . It made you think of families . The Cuisinart did not make you think of families . It reminded you of clever , unencumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light blades . It suggested not comfort but competition . Especially after you had seen it work , it made you feel as though you had better watch out and hurry . And it made you think of cooking not as part of a texture but as a hedonistic obsession . The KitchenAid projected a sense of proportion in life , the Cuisinart a kind of disproportion in which the importance of some things becomes crazily magnified while others completely disappear . In short , the KitchenAid humiliates the Cuisinart . Though the Cuisinart would seem blameless alone , next to the nobility of the KitchenAid it acquires all the bad qualities with which it is associated in Constance 's mind . In this way , it is put in its place . Perhaps the same effect could have been achieved by shooting it , but Constance does not own a gun , and , besides , it might not survive . For the fact is that , like television , the Cuisinart does have its uses . The actual value of the KitchenAid , on the other hand , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistfully puts it , " there 's something pointless about baking for two -- so much is left over . " If you want my opinion , neither machine belongs in hey kitchen , which is small for such an intense and ongoing drama and really does not have much to do with the issues in any event . Her apartment is not a farmhouse , and it is not a Beverly Hills ranch , either . Nor is it a French restaurant But one does not always have a choice in these matters . ? ? Lecture MARGARET MEAD , the anthropolo- gist , spoke on " Keeping in Step with the Future " in the auditorium of the American Museum of Natural History the other Sunday and attracted a crowd of more than a thousand , some of whose members looked about twelve years old and some a good deal older than Dr. Mead , who is seventy-five . Dr. Mead was wearing a navy-blue dress with a matching jacket and black open-toed shoes , and when she sat down at a table onstage and began to talk she sounded just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she discussed museums , stones , stuffed birds , cave paintings , Cro-Magnon man , children , parents , grandparents , dinosaurs , whales , the possibility of life in outer space , education , the youth revolution of the nineteen-sixties , the oneness of the human species , pollution , the ground , the sea , the air , the stratosphere , evolution , growing up in New Guinea , relations between the sexes , the nuclear family , communes , group liv h'IARCH 7 , 1 9 7 7 ing , and the fragmentation of communities . One of the most engaging things she said , we thought , was that if some of our spacecraft should leave the solar system and zoom past inhabited planets , then earth would have inflicted UFOs on other civilizations . After Dr. Mead had answered questions from the audience and received a standing ovation , we joined her as she walked through the auditorium on her way to an informal reception that was to he held upstairs . We remarked that the walking stick she was carrying , which was about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , looked like a divining rod . She shook her head , saying , " Some people confuse it with a divining rod , but they are misled by its V-ness . In a divining rod , the V is bigger , because you 'd have to hold it by the two forked parts , so that the other part could move up and down as you walked along . Dowsing is a fact , you know . " We said we 'd never been too sure about that . " Oh , yes , " she said . " There are people who can dowse , because they have a greater sensitivity to the changes within the physical world . Some people can do it and some people ca n't . " Dr. Mead paused to give a few autographs , and as she continued toward the rear of the auditorium , we asked her what she thought of the present state of things in general . " ' Well , this is a stressful period , " she said . " And consciousness itself is stressful . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening in the world a thousand years ago , you find that a lot of awful things were happening . But the people in one place did n't know that they were happening in another . Now we know a very large proportion of the things that are happening . They impinge on us all the time . But one reason I 'm able to remain optimistic about what the human race is going to be capable of is that I have seen people move so rapidly . I mean , there are very few people in the world who have seen the kind of change that I have  --  have actually seen it with their own eyes . I know it can happen . I know it in my bones . I 'm not completely optimistic , of course . I want us to do something about this nuclear threat , or we 're not going to be here . But I have seen the children of headhunters and cannibals becoming doctors and lawyers and dealing with complex mathematical and philosophical questions and walking around with ' The Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and cried , " Dr. Mead ! Dr. Mead ! I 've got to tell you something . You were responsible for my marriage . Thirty years ago , you spoke at the University of Denver . My family had been opposed to my marrying this man , but after I heard you speak I knew that I wanted to marry him , and I did , and I owe it all to you ! " " Are you still married to him ? " Dr. Mead asked . " Yes , " the woman said . " Good , " said Dr. Mead , and she walked on , smiling . Faces WE stopped by the public lobby of the United Nations General Assembly Building one recent morning to attend the opening of a photographic exhibit called " The Great American Face . " The particular faces on display were there because they had won a photography contest begun a year and a half ago , the idea of which was to assemble an entire family of great American faces . The show contains the photographs of forty-eight Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom , according to the judges , have the greatest . These twelve people are also the subjects of photo essays by Arnold Newman , the portrait photographer , which make up a large part of the exhibit . The owners of seven of the greatest faces  --  the Great American Grandfather , Grandmother , Father , Teen-Age Girl , Pre-Teen Boy , Baby Girl , and Baby Boy  --  were actually present in the lobby . ( Missing were the Great American Mother , Teen-Age Boy , Pre-Teen Girl , Young Adult Male , and Young Adult Female . ) That made the event resemble something that has come to be thought of as performance art , although in this case most of the performances were rather restrained , John Dorian , the Great American Grandfather and the possessor of a spectacular white handlebar mustache , performed with the least restraint . After two hours at the U.N. , all the Great American Face people went to the World Trade Center for lunch . There Mr. Dorian serenaded his companions with Greek and Turkish songs . Then he dozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all the time . He told us that , in addition to Greek and Turkish , he speaks Ar menian , French , Italian , Spanish , and " some English . " To certify his grand-fatherhood and his greatness , he hod brought along four of his grandchildren and one great-grandchild . Some of his descendants had n't seen him for a while , because a year or so ago Mr. Dorian , who was a chief mate in the merchant marine and later spent eleven years working on tugs and ferries in New York Harbor , went to live with one of his daughters , in Poway , California , near San Diego . Life there apparently agrees with him , for he pointed out a California state-flag pin on the jacket lapel of his three-piece blue suit . The Great American Faces , although more than a few of them look as if they had been ordered from Central Casting , actually come from all over the country . For instance , in the Great American Grandmother division , Keziah Patterson , of Marshalltown , Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selecting winners must have been tough on the judges , but , having met Mrs. Patterson , we agree that she was a sound choice . When we approached her , she was involved in a polite conversation about the New York weather with some people from the Kinney Shoe Corporation , which sponsored the photography contest . Mrs. Patterson continued that thread with us . " It 's been awfully cold in Iowa this winter , but we have n't had enough snow , " she said " I 'm worried about my red-raspberry bushes . Also , the alfalfa crop has been hurt , because there was n't really any snow cover when the cold came , and alfalfa 's like strawberries  --  if the ground freezes and then thaws enough times , the roots will break . " Mrs. Patterson , a widow of seventy-seven , used to operate a dairy farm with her husband , and now she owns a small flock of sheep . Arnold Newman 's work shows her during a fairly typical day : embroidering a quilt ; eating lunch with her son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith Briggs ; carrying a covered dish to a church supper and chatting with her close friend , Billie Huston . The portrait of Mrs. Patterson that won the contest was taken by Mr. Briggs , a Quaker minister who freelances as a photographer for the Marshalltown Times-Republican . He , too , was at the opening of the show , and he told us his technique for photographing a great American face . " Well , I just went and knocked on her door one day , " he said . " I was working as an extension agent with the 4-H Clubs then , and Mrs. Patterson had some extra land on her farm that we wanted to use as a vegetable garden . I introduced myself and said what I wanted . I told her , do n't want to be pushy . Take your time thinking about it . I can give you a reference , if you like . ' And she said yes , and my wife and I became her friends , and then her ' adopted grandchildren . ' Then , eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson just right : her smile ( plenty of teeth ) , her rimless eyeglasses , her short white hair ( kept under a hairnet ) , and the wrinkles that a seventy-seven-yearold woman is entitled to . Having the owners of so many great American faces present in one room offered several press photographers a chance to play with a broad range of permutations ; e.g. , Great American Baby Boy with Great American Father , and Great American Baby Girl with Great American Teen-Age Girl . Jason Jardine , the Great American Pre-Teen Boy , got fed up with the whole thing fairly quickly and spent the morning bending over , punching his forehead with the heel of his palm , and telling his parents that it was time for lunch . At one point , Mrs. Patterson stood in front of her portrait as someone from the Associated Press snapped away . " I 'm not hungry , I 'm just a hit tired of standing , " she said . " And , actually , I 'm not even tired of standing . I 'm just tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . ROBERT GALE , the United States Department of Agriculture veterinarian who serves the special needs of wayfarers at the Animalport , at Kennedy Airport , run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cru city to Animals , now has on file an official account of the events surround-ing the recent escape and recapture of Gallagher 's Pioneer , an eight-hundred-pound Aherdeen Angus hull . Galla-gher 's Pioneer has since been expatriat-ed to France . The official account , a dispassionate report handwritten by John Schneider , who is an attendant at the Animalport , is printed in its en-tirety below . In his statement , Mr. Schneider does not assign specific blame for what has come to be known as " the loose-bull incident . " However , he has told us privately that nothing un-planned would have happened if Gal-lagher 's Pioneer had been equipped with a proper nose ring . Kevin O'Brvan , the foreman of Gallagher 's Angus Farm , in Ghent , New York , where Gallagher 's Pioneer was horn , last May 6th , disputes this conclusion . On Wednesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer for the ride to J.F.K. , Mr. O'Bryan per-sonally removed Gallagher 's Pioneer 's nose ring . At that point , a well-plotted scenario called for the bull to board a cargo plane the next day to fly to France for the Salon International de PAgriculture  --  where G.P. , a perfect all-black specimen , is in fact at this moment trying his best to represent all Angus cattle everywhere . The getting there , however , was a bit of a problem . Historically , French people who have bothered to think about it have thought rather lightly of American Angus cat-tle , but Jerry- Brody and the Ameri-can Angus Association would like to change that . Mr. Brady , a member of the association , owns Gallagher 's Steak House , on West Fifty-sec-ond Street ; the Oyster Bar &; Restaurant at Grand Cen-tral Terminal ; Gallagher 's Angus Farm ; and sixty-three registered Angus hulls , cows , and calves . The pride of this herd is Manhattan Gal , who was named Su-preme Champion at the American Angus Breeders ' Futurity in Louisville last summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas City last fall and the National Western Stock Show in Denver a couple of months ago . Mr. Brody was feeling sanguine about his career as a cattleman until the loose-hull incident intruded . " Ev-erything was all set , " Mr. Brody ex-plained to us the other day . " Kevin O'Bryan brought the trailer with the bull down from the farm on Wednes-day , and while he was on his way I talked with a guy on the phone who told me that Seaboard World Airlines , the cargo airline that the bull was supposed to fly on , had a strike in Paris . All flights were landing in Frankfurt or Amsterdam and trucking to Paris . I said , ' We ca n't do that . He 'll never clear all the paperwork in either of those places in time to get to Paris . ' This bull had just spent elUrtyfour days in quarantine . Kevin left him at the A.S.P.C.A. place , and I arranged for the bull to fly with Air France on a Friday-night cargo flight . Then , on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull got loose . " We rake you quickly to John Schneider 's statement : Date : February 11 , 1977 Time : 6:15 p.m . Where : A.S.P.C.A. Garage Subject : Bull handling while trying to load At or around 6:15 p.m. found that the halter was not on the hull . Mr Harvey Coates ( livestock transporter asked horse groom , name unknown , to put it on . Said he would try . Try he did . Had only partial success . Got halter only around neck . Gave up after 15 minutes . At or around 6:30 p.m . Mr. Alex Nichols horse transporter and Walter Walter Wylie , horse handler and 2 unidentified men tried to put halter on . Had only partial success , before hull got out of stall . Halter was around neck only . For the next 5/2-hour they tried to get the bull hack into his stall . Could not do it , so we left him in the garage to calm down . About 15 minutes later they tried again , and after about 5 minutes they got the hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin O'Bryan 's reaction : " They tried to put the halter on all wrong . They tried to put it on the neck instead of the head . Then , once they let him out of his stall , they decided they could n't load him that night . They called up and said , ' We ca n't load him without you . ' So I had to go to Columbia County Airport and fly down to J.F.K. Saturday night to put on the halter . By the time I got there , Dr. Gale had managed to get the halter on , and all I had to do was give the bull a tranquillizer . Unfortunately , by then the word 's all the way to France that Gallagher 's Pioneer has a poor disposition . The fact is , he 's a victim of circumstance . Anyone who 's had proper experience working with cattle would have known how to fit on that halter . That nose ring was not the problem . He does n't need the nose ring to help him behave I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just needs to be treated reasonably . By the time I got down to New York and flew back to the farm , " Well , today I dreamed the impossible dream , and it was impossible , all right . " I wondered if we were doing the right thing trying to send that hull to Paris . I wondered if somebody was n't against us , or something . " And now Mr. Brody continues the saga : " So the bull ca n't fly out Friday night . Meanwhile , while Kevin is flying down Saturday to put on the halter , the people at Air France decide that they 're going to end up with an unruly bull on their hands , and they say we need to send an attendant with the bull to Paris . Now , this is a cargo flight , so I say , ' What are you going to do  --  make someone sleep on a mattress down in the cargo hatch next to the hull ? ' Air France says , ' Oh , no , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free drinks , everything . ' Meanwhile , the shipping charges have tripled , so I begin to have second thoughts about the whole thing , and decide to put the hull back in the A.S.P.C.A. shelter for the night . The next thing we heard was that the Seaboard cargo handlers in Paris had ended their strike , so we made a reservation with them on a Tuesday flight . All day Monday , I 'm on the phone again , talking with the people from Cofranimex , a French livestock-import-export firm . This has blown up by now into an international incident . They say , ' Your bull is too dangerous . We refuse him . ' I told him it was n't the bull 's fault , and they were willing to reconsider . I might add that the guy from Cofranimex is personally a hit peeved , because he 's already shown up at the airport three times to meet the bull and the bull has n't landed yet . Next , a Department of Agriculture man in Washington calls me and says , Should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position where they can say , " We told you so . Your Angus bull 's no doggone good . " ' So what we decided to do was compromise and have the U.S. agricultural attache meet the bull when he landed in Paris . The poor hull finally left at ten o'clock in the morning on Tuesday and did n't end up landing in Paris until three the next morning . Despite all that , the last we heard , he was doing just fine . " A few final thoughts from John Rivera , foreman , Animalport : " Hav ing a bull out here is a rare thing . I did n't see this one get loose , but I heard he was a real tiger . This is an animal-hotel-motel facility . I remember the time we had thirty cobras , but lately , with the wildlife-protection regulations , it 's mainly dogs and cats , and a lot of monkeys . We had six elephants once . They stayed a long time  --  I 'd say a good month and change . They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage doors to take them for exercise and they knew which way to go . They would n't try to run away . Then we had Oliver , the half-man , half-apeyou know , the missing link . He looked like an overgrown chimp to me , but he actually rode in the passenger section of the plane when he flew . If he could do that , I do n't know why they had to bring him here . I guess the government makes all sorts of AT.I.P. arrangements . Our job here is to see to it that there is no act of cruelty to an animal . I wo n't move certain animals without talking first to their handlers . Bulls are special . With a bull , you got to know what you 're doing . "
