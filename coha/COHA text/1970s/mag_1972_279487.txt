For eight days , miners from Washington State to Appalachia had filed into hundreds of washup shacks to vote-polling places with names like " Bill Shelby 's bathhouse at the foot of Chicken Ridge . " Many cast their ballots at the end of their shifts , still covered in coal dust . Despite the United Mine Workers ' violent tradition , there was no disorder . And despite the membership 's habit of following authoritarian leaders , the count last week showed that the men were bent on rebellion . By a vote of 70,373 to 56,334 , they ousted W.A. ( " Tony " ) Boyle , 70 , their autocratic union president for nine years , in favor of Arnold Miller , 50 , the courtly , soft-spoken leader of the union 's insurgent reform wing , a man just two years out of the mines . <P> The Labor Department had taken great pains to make sure the election would be honest , fielding 1,000 federal poll watchers during the balloting and hand-picking those who would do the counting . During the last election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was all over , Boyle 's defeated challenger , " Jock " Yablonski , was shot dead along with his wife and daughter . <P> To a large extent , Miller 's victory was a repudiation of the corruption in the Boyle regime . After the Yablonski shooting , two U.M.W. officials , one of them a close Boyle associate , were indicted for conspiracy to commit murder , and Boyle was convicted by a federal jury of handing out $49,000 in union funds to political candidates , among them Hubert Humphrey . But they also mistrusted Boyle for other reasons . He had grown aloof and unreachable . He lived high and dressed fancy , and though he won fat wage increases for his men , he seemed oblivious to the occupational hazards of mining . <P> Miller , on the other hand , was one of their own . A victim of black lung disease , after 26 years in the pits , he had become the chief spokesman for the miners in their battle to win compensation for black-lung disability . He campaigned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuratively . He promised not only to reduce the president 's $50,000 salary , but also to relocate the union headquarters from Washington , D.C. , to a spot nearer the mines . Miller , who had horrified the traditionalists by arguing for stronger controls of strip mining , credited his victory to the younger miners . " Sixty percent of the work force today are 30 years of age or under , " he said , " and they are all very much aware of the issues . " His new secretary-treasurer , Harry Patrick , 41 , saw it a little differently . He declared : " The men were just plain fed up with the whole crooked Boyle business from top to bottom .
