They wore knee-length linen dresses , white pumps and pearls instead of blue jeans , T shirts and sandals . When upset , they exclaimed only " Oh , heavens ! " or " Darn it ! " They called themselves ladies as often as they said women , and they sometimes said hero when they meant heroine . They were , in short , Republicans , not Democrats . But for all their modesty of style and rhetoric , they had unexpected influence . ' I 'm a Democrat , " said Betty Friedan , who was observing the proceedings for McCall 's , " but the emergence of women at this convention may be more important than what the women did at the Democratic Convention . " <P> The woman who was most visible was the first woman ever to give a keynote address at a major national political convention : Anne Armstrong , co-chairman of the G.O.P. National Committee . Indefatigably amiable , perpetually smiling , cello-voiced , she was charged , appropriately , with winning over Democrats to the Republican ticket . Her speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat . She herself is a convert . Brought up in upper-crust Creole society in New Orleans , graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar , she remained a Democrat until-it must be said-she married the very model of a Marlboro man , sandy-haired Tobin Armstrong , whose Texas ranch is measured in miles rather than acres . She has thoughts of running for public office when the last of her five children reaches college age . <P> Less on display but working just as hard behind the scenes were other softspoken , steely , resolute women intent on hammering out a party platform that would recognize women 's rightful role in the G.O.P. The Republicans ' answer to Gloria Steinem was Jill Ruckelshaus , wife of the director of the Environmental Protection Agency . " She has helped to de-radicalize the movement in the eyes of Republican women , " says Kitty Clyde , a comely press aide to Anne Armstrong . De-radicalize ? A phrase is born . A Roman Catholic mother of five with the clear-eyed look of a swimming instructor at a fashionable girls ' camp , Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no more chance with the Republicans than it did with the Democrats . But the plea 's the thing . " You ca n't be abrasive and hostile in a convention like this , " says Jill . " We had to come softly through the door to get women moving . " <P> The main mover was Congresswoman Peggy Heckler of Massachusetts , a peppery redhead who likes to talk and talk . And people listen . She was determined to include in the G.O.P. platform a plank on federally sponsored day-care centers for children , thereby challenging her own President , who had vetoed a child-care bill because , he felt , it would weaken the family . Refusing to take no for an answer , Peggy had a way of converting it to yes . " Language is a barrier , " she says . " Words do not mean the same to men as to women . " So she held a class for the men on the Platform Committee , who had probably not received such a lecture since they were caught filching apples from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn a lot , " sighed New Jersey Congressman Peter Frelinghuysen.
