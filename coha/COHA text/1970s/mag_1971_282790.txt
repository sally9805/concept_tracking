" I 've had only one idea in my life-a true ide fixe . To put it as bluntly as possible-the idea of having my own way . ' Control ' expresses it . The control of human behavior . In my early experimental days it was a frenzied , selfish desire to dominate . I remember the rage I used to feel when a prediction went awry . I could have shouted at the subjects of my experiments , ' Behave , damn you ! Behave as you ought ! ' " <P> - B.F . Skinner 's Walden Two . 1948 <P> THE speaker is T.E . Frazier , a character in Walden Two and the fictional founder of the Utopian community described in that novel . He is also an alter ego of the author , Burrhus Frederic Skinner , who is both a psychology professor and an institution at Harvard . Skinner is the most influential of living American psychologists , and the most controversial contemporary figure in the science of human behavior , adored as a messiah and abhorred as a menace . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to a machine , Skinner is vigorously opposed both by humanists and by Freudian psychoanalysts . Next week that opposition is bound to flare anew with the publication of Skinner 's latest book . Beyond Freedom and Dignity ( Knopf ; $6.95 ) . Its message is one that is familiar to followers of Skinner , but startling to the uninitiated : we can no longer afford freedom , and so it must be replaced with control over man , his conduct ' ' and his culture . This thesis , proposed not by a writer of science fiction but by a man of science , raises the specter of a 1984 Orwellian society that might really come to pass . It accounts , also , for the alarm and anger that Skinner 's current popularity arouses in his opponents . <P> Like the Utopians who preceded him , Skinner hopes for a society in which men of good will can work , love and live in security and in harmony . For mankind he wants enough to eat , a clean environment , and safety from nuclear cataclysm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his famous didactic novel , Walden Two . Those principles include : communal ownership of land and buildings , egalitarian relationships between men and women , devotion to art , music and literature , liberal rewards for constructive behavior , freedom from jealousy , gossip , and-astonishingly-from the ideal of freedom . Beyond Freedom and Dignity , in fact , is really a nonfiction version of Walden Two . <P> Disastrous Results <P> Skinner acknowledges that the concept of freedom played a vital role in man 's successful efforts to overthrow the tyrants who oppressed him , bolstering his courage and spurring him to nearly superhuman effort . But the same ideal , Skinner maintains , now threatens 20th century man 's continued existence . " My book , ' ' says Skinner , ' ' is an effort to demonstrate how things go bad when you make a fetish out of individual freedom and dignity . If you insist that individual rights are the summum bonum , then the whole structure of society falls down . " In fact , Skinner believes that Western culture may die and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union or of China . If that happens . Western man will have lost the only form of immortality he can hope for-the survival of his way of life . <P> Skinner 's reasoning is that freedom and free will are no more than illusions ;
