THE WRECKAGE OF AGATHON by John Gardner . 243 pages . Harper &; Row . $6.95 . <P> Dying in a Spartan jail in the year 500-and-something B.C. , the hero of this sharp and provoking little antihistorical novel finds no difficulty in giving verbatim quotations from the Dryden translation ( 17th century A.D. ) of Plutarch 's Life of Lycurgus ( 2nd century A.D. ) . It is true that he is a certified Seer of Apollo , and the future drifts before his eyes as effortlessly as the past or the present . So the reader need not be really surprised to find Lycurgus ( spelled Ly-kourgos , in the barbarous tradition of contemporary university classics departments ) , a dim semi-mythological figure , flinging out his arms in V-for-victory signs like General de Gaulle , or to hear members of the Lacedaemonian jet set chatter psychoanalysis , market analysis and Black Panther ideology while they swap wives by the suburban swimming pool . <P> The seer 's name is Agathon . He shares his cell with a family of rats that nibble his toes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demodokos , who being only an apprentice seer is called Peeker . In alternated monologues , Seer and Peeker describe the cycles of personal passion and international politics that brought them to their stinking dungeon , lit at night by government buildings burned at the hands of revolting Helots , the Spartan slaves . <P> Agathon was once a handsome and ambitious academic-political young man , an Archaic Period Kissinger to the John Mitchell of Lycurgus , the famous lawgiver who recast the constitution of Sparta in a fierce authoritarian mold . Now Agathon is a drunken old bum . In between , he has fought a battle disguised as a woman , seduced and married the daughter of an archon , helped the Ionian philosophers invent humanism , rationalism and Western civilization , betrayed his best friend to the Athenian FBI , and made love to the wives of all his friends . By teaching his greatest love , a Helot woman , to read and write and think politically , he has set events in motion that end in a blaze of atrocity and civil war . <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . But the author , in addition , sets out on a number of symbolic quests . At times Agathon , whose name in Greek means the Good , stands for the whole Western tradition of humane tolerance , now threatened by the twin fanaticisms of repression and revolution . At others , he is some kind of primordial natural force , a witness to agelong woe and fatality . At still others , when what he calls facticity catches up with him , Agathon is just a slobbish old lecher smelling of onions . In this guise he represents the irreducible , incorrigible lump of humanity that always jams up the bright theoretical machines continually being invented by one Lycurgus or another , and thus saves mankind from betterment . <P> In this guise , Agathon saves the book too . With his rambling wit , his irrelevancies , rages , blunderings , unfairnesses , with his tender-rough efforts to jerk his friend Pecker to wisdom through the muck of the world , he emerges as one of those scapegrace saints who have adorned literature from Socrates to Gulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
