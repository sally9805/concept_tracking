On top of each is a form . &nbsp; MAABoth of you sign these chits for the pieces .  --  11  --  Sweek reacts more than anyone else to the appearance of the side arms .

Buddusky and Mule stand on either side of Meadows . Meadows quivers involuntarily . Together they walk out of the office . In a moment they can be seen from the window walking down the sidewalk to the carryall . Snow flurries start to blow . The MAA tugs at his trousers , which are too tight .

Coming from Meadows , who looks incapable of any action , the statement is particularly ludicrous . Buddusky winks at Mule . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( seriously ) No , I do n't think so , but you know how it is . &nbsp; MEADOWSYes , sir . . . but , I do n't need to use the head , anyway .

Navy feels that in certain kinds of vehicular transport the prisoner shall have the use of both hands to save himself in case of accident . &nbsp; MEADOWSYes , sir . Buddusky comes up with the key and starts to unlock the handcuffs .

He removes the cuffs . The bus takes off . Buddusky looks up , as does Mule , to see passengers staring back at them , some whispering and guarded , some gawking . The two are suddenly embarrassed . They sit back . Meadows just sits and stares at nothing . 16 Out the Greyhound Window picking up on the bleak terrain from Norfolk to Richmond . Mule and Buddusky look out opposite windows . Meadows stares straight ahead , eating a Baby Ruth , getting chocolate on his hands . Mule looks idly toward Meadows , sees him eating the Baby Ruth . &nbsp; MULHALLWhere 'd you get that Baby Ruth ? &nbsp; MEADOWS ( sullen ) I had it with me . Buddusky has looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor . I was n't accusing you of nothin ' . Meadows looks at neither one of them . He wipes the chocolate from his hands onto his pea coat . They observe this , shrug , and turn back to look out their respective windows . 17 Close on Mule staring out his window . He 's leaning against the window , almost dozing , when he hears a crunching sound . He looks over to see Meadows eating corn nuts out of a cellophane package . Mule taps Buddusky 's shoulder over Meadows ' head . Both look at him again . This time Meadows sees Mule watching him . &nbsp; MEADOWSI had ' em with me ! Mule laughs .  --  18  --  &nbsp; MULHALLI ai n't said a word ! &nbsp; BUDDUSKYEasy , Meadows . You 're making Mulehouse hungry . Meadows does n't react to this , and they all lapse into silence .

They look conspicuous . The crowd gives them room , insulating them . Meadows holds the handcuffs close to his middle , trying to hide them . He keeps his eyes on the floor . An adult shushes a child and pulls his hand down when the child points toward them . A crowd of chattering schoolchildren led by their teacher pass by . They fall silent .  --  19  --  The doors swing open , and they and the crowd walk down the long , gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directed by the conductor there . 21 At a Steep Ramp they find themselves behind a frail , old COUPLE struggling to push their luggage cart . &nbsp; MULHALLCould you use a little help with that thing ? &nbsp; OLD WOMANWell , it is heavy . Mule takes the cart and pushes it to the top of the ramp . A bag of groceries with a bunch of carrots jars loose . Meadows catches it , holds it until they reach the top of the ramp . &nbsp; OLD WOMANThank you kindly . &nbsp; MANThank you , young man . They pass them and board the train . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( as they move to him ) Another good deed by our fighting men of the U.S. Navy . Mule does n't react , and Meadows certainly doesn't. 22 Int .

Buddusky leans over and undoes the handcuffs again . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( mechanically ) Do n't try any funny shit . &nbsp; MEADOWSNo , sir . Buddusky sighs , does n't even bother to correct Meadows .

Mule stops and massages his legs . His bag splits open and groceries spill into the snow . He swears . &nbsp; MULHALLFuckin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  117  --  Nobody answers . Meadows bends down to help him with the groceries , and his bag splits open too . Buddusky looks on for a moment . Then : &nbsp; BUDDUSKYThere 's a fireplace thing up there on the level . We can build a fire and warm up . The two continue picking groceries out of the snow . 119 Fireplace Level They are gathering up a few sticks of firewood and trying to break them over their knees .

He begins to chant softly , holding the stick and looking at it . When the chant builds , he tries again to break the stick over his knee . It breaks . He looks up to Buddusky and Mule . 125 Mule &amp; Buddusky &nbsp; MULHALL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( not moving ) Yeah . Buddusky rises and goes over to get another hot dog .

Suddenly Mule and Buddusky realize they are fighting alone . They head for where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They look off , past a clump of evergreens , and see that Meadows is running . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYMeadows . . . Meadows . . . Meadows ! Meadows stops abruptly .

He keeps running , furious . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( barely audible ) I lost my shoe , I lost my shoe , I lost my fucking goddam shoe . . . . It appears as if Meadows is out front and going to get away . Buddusky starts to take aim . &nbsp; MULHALLBuddusky ! No ! Buddusky looks to Mule , then back to Meadows , who suddenly disappears from view . 126 With Meadows tumbling down into a hidden gulley . He pulls himself to his feet . He still tries to chant , gets momentarily confused about what direction he was running in . He starts up the same slope he had fallen down and runs into Buddusky , who hurls himself onto Meadows . They fall in a heap on the side of the slope . &nbsp; MEADOWS ( screaming ) Let me go ! Let me go ! I want to go ! . . . I want to go , I want to get out of here ! . . . Please , God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has a hard time trying to hold Meadows down .

He tries to resist . 128 Moving Shot Across the Prison Compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look behind him . Meadows still tries to resist and is chanting loudly now . Buddusky and Mule have to hold him up . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYWill you shut up , will you please shut up ? 129 Int . Prison Hallway  --  Day They move down a hall toward the OOD 's office . Meadows is out of control and still chanting . As they reach the entrance a MARINE SERGEANT looks up from his desk . &nbsp; SERGEANTYou ca n't report with him in there like that . Baker , Mooney . Prisoner from Norfolk , on the double . Two hefty guards move down the hall toward them . &nbsp; SERGEANTJesus Christ , what did you do to him ? Meadows stops chanting . The two guards arrive and start to pull him away from Mule and Buddusky.  --  123  --  As the three part , there is one moment of silent exchange between them . They look at each other , and for this moment Meadows seems calm  --  all three seem like they want to say something reassuring to one another . Then Meadows is hustled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporal stands behind the OOD , a young Marine officer , who is seated at a desk . Buddusky and Mule stand at attention in front of the desk . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ( strained ) First Class Petty Officers Buddusky and Mulhall , sir , reporting as ordered with Seaman Meadows , a prisoner . &nbsp; OOD ( acidly ) Yes I saw the prisoner . OOD looks back at the orders , then up again at the two sailors . The OOD takes his time . He is , even for a Marine , immaculate  --  he should be the most immaculate military figure in the film . His short hair fairly bristles when he rises . He deliberately completes a circle around the two sailors . &nbsp; OODStand at ease . The two stand at ease  --  a posture between attention and at ease . The OOD continues to look them up and down . &nbsp; OODYou are a couple of piss poor chasers , Buddusky , are you aware of that ? Piss poor . Mulhall , are you aware of that fact ? &nbsp; MULHALLWhat fact ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  124  --  &nbsp; OOD ( right in his ear ) That you are piss fucking poor  --  answer me sailor . &nbsp; MULHALLNo , sir  --  I was not aware of that fact . &nbsp; OODWell you are now , are n't you ? Are n't you Buddusky ? Buddusky 's face has grown redder and redder . Mule has cast anxious glances in his direction , clearly fearing another outburst of violence from Buddusky . &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ... I 'm aware that you say so ... sir . The OOD nods , aware that Buddusky is trying to avoid capitulating completely . The OOD stands there a moment , trying to size Buddusky up , possibly gauging by just how much he wants to humiliate him . Buddusky has begun to tremble . The Marine notices it . &nbsp; OODI see you 're a signalman , Buddusky ... I realize that shore-patrol duty is not your permanent MOS , but where do you get the idea that strapping on an arm band and a side arm entitles you to abuse the prisoner ? Where ? Do they teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good time ... Buddusky is shaking more now . The OOD is inches from his face . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYI guess ... &nbsp; OOD ( aching for him to do something ) You guess what , sailor ? What ? &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ... nothing ... &nbsp; OOD ... nothing ? ...  --  125  --  &nbsp; BUDDUSKY ... nothing ... sir ... &nbsp; OOD ( quickly , to Mule ) Did the prisoner offer any resistance ? &nbsp; MULHALLNo , sir . &nbsp; OOD ( back to Buddusky ) Did he try to escape ? &nbsp; BUDDUSKYNot exactly . &nbsp; OODThat 's a little vague Buddusky , either he did or he did n't . Which is it ? Buddusky glances uneasily at Mule . &nbsp; OODYou do n't have to look at him for the answer Buddusky , or maybe you do . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYHe did n't . &nbsp; OODHe did n't what ? &nbsp; BUDDUSKYHe did n't try to escape . &nbsp; OODHe did n't try to escape sir . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYHe did n't try to escape sir . The OOD goes back to the orders . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  126  --  &nbsp; MULHALLSir ? &nbsp; OODYour orders were n't endorsed when you left , so according to this you 're still in Norfolk . &nbsp; MULHALLWell we 're standing here . &nbsp; OODYes , but you have n't left yet . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYThat 's not our fault our orders were n't endorsed , ... sir .... &nbsp; OODYes , but you have n't left ... &nbsp; MULHALLLook , both of us have a lot of time in , captain ... &nbsp; OODWhat 's that supposed to mean ... &nbsp; MULHALLToo much time to be hard-assed because some dude in Norfolk forgot to endorse our order ... sir . &nbsp; OODYou 're asking for trouble , sailor . &nbsp; MULHALLI 'm asking to see the XO . &nbsp; OODDeep trouble . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYNo , we ai n't about to say anything more until we can see the XO.  --  127  --  &nbsp; OODWhat makes you think the XO can be bothered ? ( he endorses orders ) Now get the hell out of here . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYYou 're supposed to pull a few copies . Furious , the OOD pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . 131 Ext . Portsmouth Naval Prison Buddusky and Mule move quickly out the side entrance , Buddusky redfaced . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYGoddamn grunts , they think they can get away with anything ... &nbsp; MULHALL ... yeah ... &nbsp; BUDDUSKYTelling me my job , I know my job . I know my job better than any goddamn body in the goddam Navy , goddam grunts ... &nbsp; MULHALL ... yeah ... &nbsp; BUDDUSKYWell , we told that son of a bitch , did n't we ? Reaming our ass all over the joint , and he do n't even know enough to pull copies  --  buncha candy asses . Buddusky sounds a little out of breath . He pauses at the corner . For the first time he looks directly at Mule , breathing heavily . &nbsp; MULHALL ( quietly )  --  I hate this chickenshit motherfucking chickenshit goddam detail .  --  128  --  The two stare at each other for a long moment . Then they look away , each inadvertently gazing down opposite ends of the street . Until the very last exchange they do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MULHALLNorfolk . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYI mean now . &nbsp; MULHALLDo n't know  --  stop off in Baltimore maybe . You ? &nbsp; BUDDUSKYGo back to New York . There 's a sticky pause . They look at each other . &nbsp; MULHALLWell , see you in Norfolk . &nbsp; BUDDUSKYYeah , maybe our orders came through . They walk away from each other . THE END pp. 90-114 &nbsp;
