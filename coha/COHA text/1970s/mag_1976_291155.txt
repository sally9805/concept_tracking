Now that the absorbing but unsatisfying televised debates are all over , it can be seen that they took on an undue burden because there was so little else in the campaign on which to make a judgment . Perhaps this accounts for how little sympathy the press and the public gave to the nervous participants . Even the setting made the candidates look like men in the dock , or like those carnival games in which you throw baseballs at a head sticking out of a hole . <P> As part of television 's great fall season of sports and entertainment , the debates were also a kind of World Series . If so , compare the correct professionalism of the news correspondents in the debates with those sports commentators who whomp up any event , regale you with anecdotes and pay maudlin visits to the victors ' dressing-room celebrations to fawn on the owners . In this chilled televised courtroom , the reporters were the prosecutors . Throughout the debates , a vital distance between news coverage and promotion was still kept . <P> This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our speech , the debates were more than a game . The added edge to reporters ' questions came from a frustrated feeling that here at last the candidates should be pinned down . As John Chancellor said in a recent speech , " I do n't think I 've ever seen a pettier campaign , an emptier campaign , a campaign so lacking in a discussion of real issues . " Even in the debates , the candidates had narrowed the range of things they intended to say no matter how a question was put ; they were , until the last and best debate , often demeaningly petty ; they felt free to parrot lines they had used many times before , and as a substitute for argument they regurgitated mouthfuls of numbers that were a feat of memory in an absence of thought . Nonetheless the candidates had to respond to questions they would have preferred to avoid . <P> The questions were often better than the answers , though as the old saying goes , a fool can ask ten questions while a wise man is answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than electronic journalists ; the best-balanced team of questioners were the three who queried the vice-presidential candidates ; the best single questioner was Max Frankel , who exhibited the sharpness he will bring to the New York Times editorial page when he becomes its editor in January . His question to Ford produced the famous gaffe on Eastern Europe , which Frankel , unbelieving , gave Ford a chance to correct . An equally pertinent Frankel question to Carter went unanswered as Carter unabashedly took off on his own prepared denunciation of Administration foreign policy . In this , Carter 's tactic was reminiscent of the way General Charles de Gaulle , brushing aside a flurry of specific , needling press questions , would begin loftily : " I have been asked about Algeria . " In a thousand living rooms , people might say , " Carter 's not answering the question , " but Carter was willing to take that chance ( as was Ford ) to score a point . For these were not true debates , nor true press conferences ( they were closer to an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
