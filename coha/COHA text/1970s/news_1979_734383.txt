txt THE CHICAGO Board of Education approved Supt. Joseph P. Hannon 's revised desegregation plan Wednesday despite warnings by two members that mandatory busing provisions will touch off protests by parents of all races . Hannon will take the plan , an expansion of his " Access to Excellence " program , to Patricia R. Harris , secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare MEWL on Friday as the city 's response to federal demands for desegregation . Board members John D. Carey and Mrs. Carey Preston said they expect the plan to be the basis of negotiations with the federal government that will lead to an agreement ending the student desegregation controversy that has hung over Chicago since 1964 . " IT WAS A great victory for Chicago today , " said Carey , board president . He predicted the plan would keep Chicago schools out of the courts on the desegregation issue . Mrs. Preston , who lauded the plan 's mandatory provisions , said , " 1 believe we took the first step in negotiating the final plan with HEW . " She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have opposed many Hannon proposals . Carmen Velasquez , a Latino board m e m b e r , noting that desegregation plans in other cities have weakened bilingual programs , praised Hannon 's proposal as a " framework " for integration . She called for Latino participation in developing further details . The revision was approved on an 13-to2 vote , with the dissenters , Mrs. Patricia O'Hern and Mrs. William L. Rohter , predicting that parents will take children out of public schools rather than go along with parts of the Hannon plan that require busing . " TIIIS PLAN constitutes a clear and present danger to public education in the City of Chicago , " said Mrs. Rohter , a resident of the Far Northwest Side . " I have not spoken to anyone across the city who wants to be moved . No way will you ever be able to put a child on a bus whose parents do not agree . Black parents , white parents , Hispanic parents , and all other parents reserve that right unto themselves . " A whole group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell no , we wo n't go .

Up to 30.000 more students would face busing , though they could select their new schools as long as they improve the racial balance . The plan would go into effect in the fall of 1980 . THE CONTROVERSY was stirred by four compulsory segments , which could lead to the mandatory busing . They are : ? Overcrowded schools would be reduced to 100 per cent of capacity . Students would be urged to transfer to schools where they would improve the racial mix . If not enough elect to move , a lottery would be held to determine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile classrooms , long a symbol of containment for the black community , would be phased ? out . In schools that remain above capact y , enrollment would be reduced through the same procedures used to end overcrowding . ? Schools under 60 per cent capacity would be considered for closing . Students would be bused to another school of their choice where they would improve the racial mix . ? Enrollment would be frozen when a school becomes 50 per cent black , Hispanic , or other minority . Students moving into the school 's attendance area would have to choose another school where they would improve the racial balance . HANNON SAID , " We are most grateful that a plan was adopted crossing all racial lines . We still have a long way to go .

" If we start on the road to mandatory assignment , what will step people of all races from sending their children to their neighborhood private school ? I do n't know how we can push a mandatory program on people . "
