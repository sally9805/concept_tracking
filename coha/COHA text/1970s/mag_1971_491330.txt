// comedy and a skirting of outrage and irony such as the nation has rarely seen . His material , the absur  --  dity of the human condition , has moved humorists from the dawn of man , but Al Capp has given it a special style and sharper bite . His target is the sense of outrage at loose in the world . His tools are tele  --  vision , radio , records , the theater , books and the lecture platform ; he gets as much as $5,000 a night just to insult college kids to their faces . But his most trenchant , and enduring , tool is a comic strip called " Li'l Abner . " It has made him , simply and unquestionably , the foremost satirist in America today and one of the most hyperbolically hated men in the nation . ?

" Now that he 's making fun of the Left , they do n't think he 's funny anymore , " said William F. Buckley . Al Capp is his normal se  --  rene and reflective self about all this . " Puberty worship has achieved such lunacy that subhumans are permit  --  ted to babble as though they were talking sanity , " he says with his customary cheerful reserve . Actually , he was not talking of his critics so much as of his most ardent constit  --  uents  --  the radical left and those elements in the young whose ravening malice has given him an extended and vastly exciting career . With  --  out them , he might have drifted off into a prosperous and peaceful celebrity , re  --  nowned mostly as a satirist mixing surrealistic gobbets of horror , action , and mys  --  tery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930 's and thereafter  --  as venal politicians , sadistic cops , and bloated big businessmen .

Those were the rich , warm days of yesteryear when Time magazine reported breath  --  lessly about Al Capp : " The faithful number him among the great men of U.S. arts and letters . " The enthusiasm began to wane somewhat when Capp began satirizing some of the antics of the New Establishment  --  the untouchable young andthe radical left . His methods were classically Cap  --  pian : he came up with a comic-strip character named Joanie Phoanie who had unraveled hair and sandal straps that devoured her legs , who gulped down caviar in front of starving children , and who sang folk songs of brotherhood in order to incite riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the boys in blue .

Be  --  sides , he growled , " She should remember that pro  --  test singers do n't own protest . When she protests about my right to protest , she 's killing the whole racket . " Lost in the cloud of controversy is the more enduring significance of Al Capp as a creative contributor to Americana . His satire , and the comic characters and language which are its vehi  --  cle , have become as much a part of the folklore of the nation as Huck Finn and Torn Sawyer . A pub  --  lisher recently said : " Any city that does n't run Li'l Abner in one of its papers is comparable to a city that does n't have Mark Twain in one of its librar  --  ies . " He gave not only Dogpatch but Sadie Hawk  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ture . He gave not only Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae but also Joe Btfsplk , the Noodniks , Appassionata Van Climax , General Bullmoose , and Fearless Fos  --  dick to the panoply of American character . He gave Kickapoo Joy Juice , a liquor of such stupefy  --  ing potency that the hardiest citizen of Dogpatch will  --  on one sip  --  pop into the air , stiff as a frozen cod . To the American palate lie gave the Shmoo , which cheerfully satisfies every man 's avarice , and the Kigmy , which just as cheerfully receives every man 's hostility ( without kicking back ) to the American dream  --  gave " amoozin ' but confooz  --  in ' " and " natcherly " and " as any fool can plain  --  ly see ? / can see " and the more-written-than  --  spoken expletive " Sob !

" Another time he had to be rushed to the hospital for a gallbladder operation . " 1 was working two days later . In absolute agony . " He carried the strip around with him on planes and in hotel rooms in order to keep it up to date : " It was like living on the edge of a precipice . " Why did he do it ? " Because Abner be  --  came the most popular com  --  ic strip in the world before I knew how to do it , " he says . " And it began making a n enormous amount of money and piling up an enor  --  mous list of newspapers , and 1 collected an endless stable of insolvent relatives  --  and all of this was based on an enter  --  tainment I did n't know any  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd come out of a remorseless span of abject poverty and he did n't know how to go about the business of staying rich . " It took me so long to draw any  --  thing . It took me so long to make up my mind about what I was writing . I should have served a ten-year ap  --  prenticeship , but I had no apprenticeship . I just went in and six months after I creat  --  ed it , I had the most popular comic strip in the world and I did n't know how I 'd done it . I had n't the faintest idea  --  there was never a strip like this and it was out of sheer desperation that the thing was so lively and unpredictable for so many years . " There was an exhilarating sense of chaos about the way in which Capp went about all this . He has never , for instance , found a permanent home for Dogpatch ; it 's pretty much where he needs it to be for the story line  --  sometimes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  low . The characters come from the hyperbolic cerebrations of Capp himself . The " Shmoo , " he says , came when he asked himself " What would happen if we really had everything we wanted could we bear it ? " The Shmoos , which offered everything " we " wanted , were his answer . " It turned out we could n't bear it , " he says . The names of the characters come from his own viscer  --  al touch with literature . " My guy was Dickens , " he says , " and if Dickens had a character who led a twisted life , that was his name  --  Oliver Twist . " So it was with all of Dickens ' characters -- Scrooge was clearly a miser , Fagin is clearly the kind of man who trains young boys to be thieves . " No nonsense about it  --  you knew who the character was by his name , " says Dickensian Capp . His names have the same quality . The guy who runs the Skonk Works in Dogpatch is  --  who else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  what else ? ? Senator Phogbound . His stiff-necked old industri  --  alist was-what else ? ? Stubborn J. Tolliver . His characters named Slobberlips Mciab , and Moon  --  beam McSwine and Appassionata Van Climax  --  guess what her role was ? ? had everything but sub  --  tlety . Even his self-image , Joe Btfsplk , had some  --  thing authentic in Capp 's own popularity : " the only way you can pronounce it , " he says with a half-grunting hoot of laughter , " is as a Bronx cheer . " The greatest danger in all this is in something happening to the real people on whom certain sa  --  tirical characters are based . " I try to pick very healthy characters , " says Capp . If the subject dies during the ten weeks between the time when the strip is drawn and when it 's printed , " then I 'm guilty of tastelessness beyond measure , because the public is convinced that every strip was done the night before . " So far , " no public figure has died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EzioPinza , the opera star who also played the male lead in South Pacific . " I invented an operatic thief called Ezio the Pincher , ' " says Capp . " He used to steal things during intermission at the opera . " Capp had sent the finished strips off to the syndicate when suddenly Ezio Finn fell desperately ill . " I really sweated that thing through , " he says . " If he had died , and Ezio the Pincher was cavorting through the comic strip , I would have been the most heart  --  less creature in the world . But bless his soul , he struggled through . " The sequence was ended and then a few weeks after that " he had a relapse and died . " Late last summer , Capp had penned a se  --  quence in which a character strikingly like Hubert Humphrey walks through the strip . " Good God , Hubert had better be careful ! " He also has another " live one " in an industrialist named Larson Whip  --  lash : " He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he looks like Ralph Nader . Larson Whiplash moans , ' why did he pick him of all people to look like ! ' He says , ' If I die , I 'll look up from wherever I am and see everything in his hands . ' " Capp has his own problems with the characterization : " Nader- bless his little hide  --  better stay alive . Or I 'm in trouble . " But not - all things considered  --  in as much trouble as Nader . No longer does it take Al Capp every waking hour to accomplish all this . For one thing he 's learned in the last four decades is how to accom  --  plish Li'I Abner in three and one-half days a week . None of the work is done in his Park Avenue apart  --  ment in New York . That 's reserved for his TV and business enterprises . He goes " home " to get the comic strip done and " home " is in the citadel of liberalism , in Cambridge , Massachusetts ( " a stone 's throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt much " ) . Actually , Capp only lives in Cambridge  --  if you want to call that living  --  but he works on Beacon Street in Boston . " I bought a building there and had an apartment remodeled into a studio , " he says . He likes to get to work early in the morning " the morning is the best time to create , your en  --  ergy is at its peak " ? to explore the basic story line of the strip . He does it with his two assistants , Andy Amato and Harvey Curtis , dramatizing his story ideas with them , " taking all the roles myself and acting out the lines and writing them down . " His assistants , exposed to Capp 's ideas daily since 1934 , are not terribly enthusiastic about them . " They have a resistance to everything I say  --  they 're gloomy , very gloomy , " says Capp in mock exasperation . Both Amato and Curtis are sharp and original gag men , but they do n't share all the theological compulsions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my running ( for sena  --  tor ) against Teddy Kennedy , they were appalled by it , " says Capp . It is not because they think the theology is wrong ; they simply feet that it does n't belong in Li'l Abner . " Their attitude is ' A political  --  cian is just a poor soul we draw in the strip . ' They say ' Let 's get on with Dogpatch and let the world run itself . ' " In calmer moments , Capp tends to agree : " I 've always taken a strong stand on what I feel and my strongly patriotic stand lately has hurt the strip . " But the calm moments are not often seen on Beacon Street . Andy and Harvey watch Capp bustling about the world and observe sagely , " Why do n't you simmer down ? Run this studio  --  let the President run the country . " Capp has worked with them since 1936 and he 's not only accustomed to their insults but he measures their mordancy with barometrical precision . " At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally and wearily say , Well , that idea is n't quite as lousy as the others  --  we might as well try it . ' That 's the highest praise I 've ever gotten from them , " cheerfully says Capp . " What they really mean is that at last one of my ideas is half as good as one of theirs . " At that point the conference is over . " I take a blank strip , put the dialogue in and I map out the action , " says Capp . He gives the strip to Andy who develops the characters and the action from the Capp outlines , with Harvey 's advice . " Then I bring the strip along to another stage and they bring it to a further stage . " Then Harvey inks in the dialogue over Al 's pencil marks . In the end , Capp inks in thefaces . " No one touches the faces but me . " Over the years , each story within the daily strip has taken six weeks to tell . Then Al began feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months ago . " Now the stories take only about four and a half weeks to tell . In doing all this , Al works in the studio without coming up for air ? " I take my lunch at the desk . " At night he goes home and sometimes works at a drawing board there . " So I only work three and a half days a week , but I average twelve to fifteen hours a day , " he says . The value of having assistants is that they can do the background and inking-in on a normal workday span while Capp is off doing something else , such as : ? Writing a weekly column syndicated by the New York Daily News . ? Writing a spoken piece set to music called " Cantata for the Disgusted . " It is expected to be performed this winter with the Winnipeg Sym  --  phony Orchestra . " And some other orchestras are asking about it . " ? Putting together a weekly talk show for tele  --  vision . ? Putting together a book of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been published and he 's under contract to produce three collections of his comic strips . ? Going on the lecture circuit : he makes as many as four appearances in two days , picking up as much as $20,000 for his efforts . ( " I charge an extra $1,000 at Ivy League schools , " he says . " For combat pay . " ) Most of his fees are designated for scholarships to black and white students . When he is n't doing this , he 's making a whirl  --  wind vacation in England . He scoops up as many of his eight grandchildren as are available ( " I feel the role of a grandfather is to corrupt his grandchil  --  dren with kindness " ) and bundles them onto his favorite vehicle , the S.S. France . ( " The French have n't yet learned how to run a country  --  or much of anything  --  but they sure can run a boat . That boat has the last surviving civil Frenchmen . You can sink France and keep that boat and you pre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes them off to England and they go to the Savoy Hotel in London and Al lets the kids rip . ( " I have never yet had the courage to look at a bill of mine at the Savoy . I want nothing as squalid as money to inter  --  fere with my enjoyment of that hotel . I do n't want to know what anything costs  --  I 'll just tell my lawyer to sell my home . . . . " ) Not unexpectedly , the bill may include eight or ten people ? " I 'll have some grandchildren with me and my wife and daughters and son-in-law , whoever 's available . " Nevertheless , it is the grandchildren he enjoys most . " I take them back home thoroughly spoiled , " he says triumphantly . " They certainly are no longer adjusted to the comparatively sordid little lives that kids must lead when their grand  --  parents are n't around . " The remarkable thing in all this hyperbolic ac  --  tivity is that Al Capp does it on one leg- an artifi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thigh . It 's the result of an accident that took place when he was nine years old and living in New Haven , Connecticut : he was hitching a ride on an ice wagon one day and he fell off and under the wheels of a streetcar . " When they took me to the hospital , I had no identification and so they roused me and I looked at the leg and it was a mess  --  like scrambled eggs , " he says . " There was just nothing that you could call a ' leg ' left of it . " It tended to accent his youth in a variety of ways . " What irritated me was the concern of other kids . The kids who were my natural enemies  --  the little beasts who were my closest friends  --  suddenly became very tender , " he says . " I coul n't stand that . " In adolescence , he found the lack of mobility a little confining for the classic American calisthenic : girl-chasing . He 'd take up a leaning spot against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move  --  he could do some station  --  ary girl-chasing , using his vocal more than his leg muscles . " As long as I stayed in one place , the girls I stared and whistled at treated me like any other street-smart wise guy  --  with an exaggerated dis  --  dain , " he wrote in an article in the Atlantic Month  --  ly , back in the days when such liberal magazines vied for Capp 's prose . He 'd spend an ego-filling afternoon , matching inviting look-backs vs. snooty look-aways when one day an exceptionally pretty young lady went by and , after looking at Capp , dropped her school pad in the street . Her look invited Al to pick it up and re  --  turn it . " My triumph filled me with pan  --  ic , " he has recalled . " If I moved after the pad , she 'd find out " ? about his be  --  ing one-legged . So he stared stonily off in the other direction until the girl-in  --  the-car was gone . Then he limped out quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name and address . She lived in the best section of town ? " an area of great houses , with wide ve  --  randas and all with steps . " Steps are a particular torment to a boy with a wooden leg . On level ground he can ex  --  ploit a certain rhythm in swinging the artificial leg after him ? " I look at it as something that it has to go where I go , " says Al Capp . But climbing steps is a slow and painful process : step up on the good leg , stop , pull the wooden leg up , stand and get your balance , step up again with the good leg and repeat the process . " It is a slow and unappealing process  --  one that irritates me to this day , " says Capp . But he phoned the girl and agreed to come over to her house to return her pad to her  --  about 7 o'clock one Satur  --  day night . Capp got to her house long before the appointed hour , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on a veranda swing well be  --  fore she came out to greet him : he simply did n't want her to see the way he walked . Shortly before 7 o'clock , the girl appeared at the screen door and seemed startled to see him there already . " I 'm sor  --  ry -- 1 have to go away tonight , " she said abruptly . " Thank you very much for returning the pad . Please leave it on the chair . " Capp dropped the pad and  --  after a moment  --  painfully limped away . He never saw her again . " It would have been too much for both of us to bear . " For they had been playing the same game : she had planned to be on the ve  --  randa swing early  --  just as he 'd planned the same thing . " For in that instant of her turning away from the door , I had seen the stiffening of her shoulder , the outthrust movement of her hip , the sure signs that she , too  --  of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . " There were times when being one-legged cheerlessly invaded Capp 's sub  --  conscious . " I had nightmares about be  --  ing a father and suddenly having a child born with one leg , " he says . But he did not let them plague him often : it is n't in his makeup to be defeated by mere di  --  saster . " A loss is a loss and there is n't any sense brooding about it , " he says . " You work with what 's left and see whether you can make some kind of spiritual or emotional profit out of it . " The thing it did for him was turn him in  --  to a vagrant  --  he dropped out of high school and began limping around the country . " That was in the day of the wandering kid  --  kids who wandered all over the country in freight cars , " he says . " I was determined to hitchhike and jump trains  --  do what the other kids did . " It was on one of these teenage ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of Tennessee and Ken-more work . " So I have shoes made " ? by a London boot maker ? " and I order three right shoes for every left shoe . In effect , I 'm buying 3 pairs of shoes . " He does not much pamper his wooden leg  --  it is old and worn and not too ex  --  otic , as artificial legs go . " This thing must be twenty years old , " says Capp , pulling up his pant leg . " It 's obsolete , it 's a museum piece  --  maybe I 'll have it painted to get rid of the nicks and scrapes . But it 's comfortable and be damned if I 'm going to give up two or three days of my life trying to get ad  --  justed to another leg . " What amuses him is the way other people adjust to his " other leg . " " My daughters , my grandaughters , were all absolutely fascinated by it , " he says . " They discover about the age of four that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one granddaughter now who al  --  ways stiffens one leg when she walks with me  --  she wants to walk like me . " He also has a dog that regards the leg as his enemy ; he snarls and circles it hos  --  tilely if Capp happens to leave it lying around the house . " Once the leg fell on him and he 's absolutely convinced that the thing kicked him , " says Capp . The controlled reaction that he cites best  --  and most hilariously  --  took place in the Savoy Hotel in London . He retired and , as was not unusual , he slipped the wooden leg under his bed , still shod with shoe and sock ? " there 's no sense in undressing the shoes and socks on a wooden leg be  --  fore you go to bed . 1 mean , it 's not going to sleep any better " The next morning , a waiter arrived to take his order for breakfast in bed . As Capp was ordering breakfast , the waiter gave a start : he 'd just seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under the bed . But he was terribly correct about it : when Capp finished with his order , the waiter simply said , " Very good sir . And now what will the other gentleman have ? " That Capp can not throw out his old legs is part of his personality pattern : " I ca n't throw out old clothes , I save old paper clips  --  I think it 's sinful , just sinful to throw things away . " He grew up poor ; when he got married he had so little money that his bride , Catherine , had to go back and live with her parents in Amesbury , Massachusetts , while he tried to make a living as a cartoonist in New York . " I still wake up in the morn  --  ing , stunned to think that I can buy a necktie if I want to , " he says . " I am enveloped by a feeling of opulence every time I hail a cab . " He 's been mak  --  ing big money ? in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still afraid I may not eat tomorrow . I 'm fright  --  ened  --  I 'll probably never stop being frightened . " This cloud , like the clouds of con  --  troversy and of physical catastrophe , come from knowing the subject  --  the grinding , mindless , soul-searing pov  --  erty  --  from the inside , instead of as an abstraction , or a study in history or a special project of the college economics classes . " Dogpatch is a country club compared to the ghettos where I grew up , " he says . He was born on September 28 , 1909 , as Alfred Gerald Caplin . ( He changed his name legally in 1949 to conform to the signature he 's always used in the strip . ) He lived in New Haven , Connecticut , then , and his mother tutored the children in the techniques of living on nothing at all : wheedling stale bread from bakers , refusing to deal with grocers who would n't hire one of her sons , leading the children on rub  --  bish raids that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even an unused piece of coal . " Her hair turned white before she was thirty-five , " Al has re  --  called . " She was cheerful enough but she had sort of a haunted look  --  she never had any pretty clothes or good times . " Later , when her four chil  --  dren got in the way of good times , they sent her a handsome hunk of cash every week " so that what  --  ever years she had from fifty on would be different from the years before . " But the money did n't seem to change his mother 's way of life . She did n't move into a new home ; she kept saying she was comfortable in the old one . She did n't hire any maids ; she kept saying she liked to do housework . She would n't go on vacations to Florida or to Europe ; the children planned them for her time and again and time and again she postponed them . When she died , some twenty years later , the four kids assumed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd sent her . They were astonished to find that their mother had almost nothing when she died . For what she 'd done with the checks from her children was to get four more children  --  war orphans she asked to have sent to her by a ref  --  ugee organization  --  and raise them as she 's raised her own . Only in better circumstances  --  in a home and with a family not far from her own . " She never told us about the four new kids , " says Capp . " I guess she was n't sure we 'd approve of her going through the whole mess again . " They not only ap  --  proved but were enlightened by her effort : as Al Capp says , they came to understand that " mother  --  hood is sort of an incurable condition . " Al Capp also learned much from his father , if only how to part the eternal clouds hanging over a man . The elder Caplin was glib , cheerful , and out ? wardly optimistic  --  but , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . His father had studied law at Yale  --  because that 's what his family wanted  --  but felt himself drawn in other directions ; he spent many of the years wandering off to seek his fortune in a variety of schemes . " My father 's real talent was drawing , " says Al Capp . " He was a most naturally gifted com  --  ic artist . I grew up watching my father do comic strips on brown paper bags with my mother and himself as the two principal characters . He always triumphed over her in those strips . But only in them . Never in real life . " Al himself found the same metier somewhat ego-building . He did passably well in school until he hit mathematics ? " I was reduced to an ox , a stunned ox , " says Capp . " I failed geometry nine times . " But he won a certain celebrity in school with his drawings and illustrations . " 1 inherited just a little bit of my father 's gift for drawing . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . I had a little bit of talent and I worked hard and now I 'm a competent illustrator . But my father had a great bug-winning sense of humor and I inherited just a little bit of that . " When he was twelve , Al read about Bud Fisher , who created " Mutt and Jeff . " He was making $4,000 a week and constantly marrying French countesses , " says Capp . " I did n't understand about the French countesses then but l sure did understand about the money . " That kind of Continued on page 148 ? El AL CAPP continued from page 45 ambition responded to his own in  --  stinct : " I could be a story teller and 1 could be drawing pictures . " In his teens he was n't doing much at school ? " I was a truant ; I could n't take the boredom " ? and he did n't quite know what to do about his own drawing ambitions until he dis  --  covered that the Pennsylvania Acad  --  emy of Fine Arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stu  --  dents on the basis of a portfolio of drawings . He had nothing else ; he could n't get a transcript of credits .

He man  --  aged to stay there for a few months , conning the school and boarding  --  house keepers about the money that never quite arrived . Finally he got thrown out for non-payment of tu  --  ition and rent , and he hitchhiked around the country to find another school where he could go for a few months until he was faced with hav  --  ing to pay . He never aspired to paint  --  ing . " I simply wanted to draw , like my idols who illustrated stories in The Saturday Evening Post . I consid  --  ered them greater artists than those in museums . " So he concentrated on learning the basics well ? " I 'm a pretty good draftsman " ? and when he was n't getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hitch  --  hiking around , looking at the coun  --  try literally from the ground up , and storing up experiences . " It took me three or four years to get a pretty de  --  cent , if rather chaotic education in art , " he says . Eventually he wound up in New York , living on the bum in Central Park some of the time , living in " air  --  less little ratholes " in Greenwich Vil  --  lage the rest of the time . He drew advertising strips for a few dollars apiece , drew " Colonel Gilfeather " ? an out-and-out imitation of " Major Hoople " ? for the Associated Press , and eventually got a $22.50-a-week job as an assistant to Ham Fisher , who drew " Joe Palooka . " It took two or three years  --  and a bride who had to be sent home to her parents  --  before he took his idea for a strip based on hillbillies to King Features and was offered $200 a week for it  --  a fortune at the time . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody 's interested in hillbillies . We 'll put the action in a nice sub  --  urb . " Capp turned them down .

" Li'l Abner " was what he wanted to do  --  nothing else , and nothing less . Final  --  ly , United Features agreed to take a chance on the startling new strip at a cautious $50 a week . It proved to be an enormous and immediate success . " Because it was outrageous , " he says . It was a hiero  --  glyphic in hyperbole : he would de  --  velop an utterly impossible situation and have his characters survive it ? " this was the early days of my mar  --  riage and the beginning of my chil  --  dren , and I was going through all this myself . You found it in the strip , " he says . He tried to keep the humor high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . " I build fun the way an architect builds a house , " he says . " I know what you place as a foundation , and how you erect the framework , and how you finish it off . It all takes thirty sec  --  onds in the reading and yet it 's all put together as carefully as a new home . " Through it all he was terri  --  fied that the urgent clamor of popu  --  larity would die --  " I 'd take a month of strips and throw them in the wastebasket and start over because 1 thought I could do better . " He also used every drawing technique possi  --  ble to focus the reader 's eye on his strip , not on the one above it or the one below it . He made his characters very big and very simple , he made the girls superbly well-built , and he made certain words in the dialogue very provocative : " Daisy Mae DOES N'T LOVE anybody but Li'l Abner " in heavy capitals . He had fun doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance  --  as well as those of the na  --  tion . Capp 's Joy Juice for a soft drink . Somehow it never led him into the stock market ? " I never bought a stock on the stock market . I have no confidence in it . " He invests principally in municipal bonds , which return a modest rate of interest . " I have no head for high finance . have the attitude of a day laborer , " he says . " 1 do a day 's work and I get a day 's pay for it . I believe in that sort of money . " In all these years , he was a certi  --  fied " liberal . " For many years he has been a life-member of the NAACP  --  joining back when it was n't chic and actually risky for a public figure , and in the 1950 's he was satirizing some of the repressive aspects of the red-hunting tactics of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy . He became a wild  --  ly popular figure in the Old Liberal establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends on the Harvard faculty and became something of a hero in that commu  --  nity . When a list was drawn up for a national magazine of the twelve  --  most-popular party guests in Cam  --  bridge , Capp turned up on every list  --  the only person not on the fac  --  ulty of either Harvard or its Cam ? bridge neighbor , M.I.T. In general , he was regarded as the living apothe  --  osis of Mark Twain , Lewis Carroll and Voltaire , and his creations were an historic folk tale told in the media of 20th-Century America . The fact was that Capp was in  --  spired less by a political creed than a personal one . " The strip was about the way the powerful use power  --  and abuse the powerless , " he says . " The possession of power must never he accepted as deserved or un  --  arguable . You must always remain skeptical . " He stayed skeptical  --  but the " deserved and unarguable " pow  --  er of the thirties , forties and fifties shifted into other hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on insistently by the high priests of television , Capp shifted his targets . It was n't simply that he satirized the Youth Cult or the TV men who made it popular ; it was that he sat  --  irized the politicians who rushed in hoping to acquire a political future through an ego-caress of today 's youth . He also began satirizing those who made a cult of their disaffection for contemporary American society , those who do not simply expose its flaws  --  as Capp himself did in the thir  --  ties , forties and fifties  --  in an effort to heal its illnesses but to whom the illness is more important than the healing . Their effort , as Capp sees it , is less to raise the ghetto to the level of the rest of society than to punish society by reducing all of it to the level of the ghetto . " There 's an ugli  --  ness in American life today  --  you see it in the way some of the kids dress , the way some of them act . Somehow in the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world into a ghetto . I think that this generation has made everything as ugly as the ghettos I lived in  --  not out of sympa  --  thy , but as a form of punishment . " He suggests that the cultists preach love but act out hate  --  that they " are using the people trapped in the ghet  --  to to build hate for other people . They 're telling us , they 're telling them , ' Hate and despise your neigh  --  bor and you 'll elevate yourself . ' But I grew up in a ghetto , a poorer one than most of these kids have ever , ; cen and I know the people in the ghetto are n't as much interested in hating those who live better lives , as in joining them . " He did more than just talk and write and draw about all this . He took action on his own ironic action . He began using some of the income from his lectures on campus to send ghetto kids to col  --  lege and to help support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some former students from liberal Eastern colleges during a bank robbery in Boston , Massachusetts . The pungency with which he ex  --  presses all this  --  as sharp and biting as his old satire of the Right  --  has caused a massive disaffection by his old friends and onetime admirers . His popularity in the home pre  --  cincts , in particular , began to fade . He was not only not on all the party lists in Cambridge , but soon he was n't on any of them . " My neigh  --  bors are solicitous about my condi  --  tion when they meet my wife in Har  --  vard Square , " he says . " ' And how is poor Al ? ' they ask . As if having lost my liberalism I 've lost my health . " His wife is a shy , retiring woman any  --  way , who does not care much for any public notice , much less the ce  --  lebrity that her husband attracts . " She wo n't go on a speaking date with me because she 's sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " And I 'm afraid she 's right ! " His granddaughters , however , are utterly enchanted by the same op  --  portunity . " They 're not upset too much by the chance that somebody may boo me , " he says . They came with him to Chicago last spring to hear him address the National Asso  --  ciation of Broadcasters . It was one of those sadomasochistic gestures on both sides in which the opposition warmed up by giving the guest speak  --  er a heated  --  not warm ? welcome . " Do n't you worry , " Al told his granddaughters . " They 'll be cheer  --  ing " Gumpy " ? the children 's nick  --  name for him ? " by the time he 's through . " He was right . He genially roasted the TV news shows ? " I 've studied tact under Spiro Agnew , " he explained  --  and the audience ate it up . He started by saying that he lamented the treatment accorded " the most despised minority group in this country  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nighttime network talk shows . . . " Or on the nighttime news shows . ? " Walter Cronkite tries to be fair . Frequently he succeeds . ? " Eric Sevareid is too high-mind  --  ed ... or , possibly , too exhaust  --  ed . . . to revile the President , but it 's clear that he regrets him . ? " David Brinkley and Frank McGee try to conceal their contempt for the President , but not very hard . John Chancellor makes no effort to conceal his  --  not even in the Presi  --  dent 's presence .. ? " Harry Reasoner does n't al  --  ways snarl at the President . Some  --  times he merely sneers . And their staffs , the Kalbs , the Kaplows , the Wallaces , the Agronskys , are honest men , too . They are honestly biased against the President and they make an honest effort to conceal it , too . But they ca n't . Too honest , I guess . " What , he asked the NAB , do the newscasters accomplish by " relent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely destroying this President as we destroyed the last one ? Or are we destroying the Presidency itself ? " The standing ovation he received from the audience of 3,000 who were associates of his targets  --  and who were sometimes their employ  --  ers  --  went on for five minutes , an eternity-without-talk in TV land . It reflects one of his internal feelings : that there is a greater variety of opin  --  ion ? a broader range of outlooks  --  in America than is reflected , or permit  --  ted , by the small minority of men who announce the news . It is not necessarily that Capp 's audience agrees with him ; it is that they agree with his right to express , pungently , a different opinion than is delivered on TV . " You go on campus , 90 per  --  cent of the kids are eager to hear you , although they may disagree with you , " he says . " But you 've got a tiny number , a dozen or so crazed little Nazis , and you 're in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one . " He 's had to cancel only one campus appearance because , he says , of a plot to attack him physical  --  ly . But no audience he has ever faced , even on the most turbulent campuses , has ever succeeded in silencing Capp . Capp has startling political opin  --  ions . He regards President Nixon , At  --  torney General John Mitchell , and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as defenders of liberalism  --  because of their hostility to anarchism  --  a view that might dismay those men . His writings and drawings , though now denounced by the left as having changed to pro-right are basically un  --  changed from his early days . They still express Capp 's sympathy for the underdog  --  his determination for puncturing the pomposities in public life , for slicing at power wherever it exists , even , as he now feels it exists on the left . Thus he could not as  --  sume power : he could not possibly , for instance , take seriously the sug  --  gestion that he run in 1970 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , he is too independent a man : in one of his earliest radio jobs , on a program sponsored by Lee Hats , he trium  --  phantly made it clear that he did n't wear a hat and that he only owned one hat  --  an Adam hat . For another thing , his present platform is broader and more flexible than politics pro  --  vide . " Whether my voice adds to the chaos or helps clear the air , I do n't know . All I know is that it speaks for millions of otherwise voiceless Americans . " Beneath , however , one can detect a wish to escape the con  --  troversy that hangs over his head like the cloud over Joe Btfsplk . " I 'm six  --  ty-two now and I 'm tired of this bat  --  tering . I want to live the next few years peacefully . But while there is no peace in America , it 's up to guys like me , I think , to serve in any way we can in the combat . " n  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
