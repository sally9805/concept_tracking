txt Some new clashes with King Hussein 's Jordan forces and a few scattered attacks against Israeli settlements on the Lebanese border have not done much to change the new " low profile " of the Palestinian guerrillas . This results from the September civil war in Jordan . The Jordan Army badly mauled the guerrilla movement , which is recovering fast under the conditions of relative peace it has enjoyed during the past month . The guerrilla leadership under Yasir Arafat , Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) central committee chief , also has reached a sobering realization : Most of the movement 's outside allies , even the Chinese Communists , are not unconditional ones . Some of them , like the Syrians and Iraqis , can be a liability at times . Former Tunisian Premier Bahl Ladgham , who has supervised implementation of the peace accords between guerrillas and Jordan authorities , was reporting to Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Sudanese Maj. Gen. Jaafar al-Nimery in Cairo on progress toward peace when new fighting erupted briefly in Amman Nov. 3 . The mission of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has enhanced Tunisian prestige in the Arab World .

Convene , chief photographer Palestinian guerrillas ' stay low ' *Arab guerrillas regroup // Egyptian Brig . Gen. Ahmed Abdel Hamid Hilmi , chief Arab military observer in Jordan , flew into Amman from Cairo Nov. 3 to investigate about five hours of sporadic shooting between armed Palestinian civilians and the Jordan Army . Each side blamed the other for starting the fighting . The Jordan Government said an unspecified number of soldiers and policemen were killed and some vehicles burned . The guerrilla version was 15 persons killed . There is an obvious desire of the Palestinian leaders , including the radicals such as George Habbash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , to avoid trouble with Arab governments .

For the first time , the Al-Fatah newspaper even printed a photo of King Hussein . He was shaking hands with Mr. Arafat in the Oct. 13 ceremony signing the peace accord . In Lebanon , the Palestinians have made several conciliatory gestures toward the new government of Prime Minister Saeb Salam . The central committee helped search for a former Syrian intelligence officer kidnapped here and Mr. Salam said he was satisfied the Palestinian had nothing to do with it . Mr. Arafat led a meeting in Beirut at which the 10 major guerrilla groups here decided to improve their relations with the Lebanese . Guerrilla offices outside Beirut were ordered closed , except for one PLO bureau each in the 15 refugee camps . Each of the 10 main organizations keeps only one office in Beirut .

The Arab Liberation Front , sponsored by the Iraqi regime , is suffering from a dispute between rival factions of the ruling Baath ( Arab socialist ) Party clan in Iraq as a result of failure of Iraqi troops to help the guerrillas in the Jordan crisis . Command being revamped In Al-Fatah , Mr. Arafat had earlier delegated many of his formerly sweeping powers to subordinates to take on administrative tasks in the PLO command structure . The Al-Fatah command is itself being revamped . The central committee newspaper has announced the " reorganization .
