An American family retraces the steps of the pioneer wagon party who met death in the Donner Pass by starvation and cannibalism more than a hundred years ago . TAMES CLYMAN , A MAN AT HOME in the Western j wilderness before any map maker charted it , wrote the ironic and tender words into his journal while sitting beside a fresh grave in Kansas in the summer of 1846 . The grave held the body of an elderly woman who had come down by wagon from Illinois bound for California . Clyman had met her son-in-law farther west , at Fort Laramie , an old friend who fought with him and with Abe Lincoln in the Black Hawk War , James Fratier Reed . Of Scottish and Polish descent and only year earlier a prosperous Chicago businessman , Reed had sold out his business interests , commisdoned a huge two-story wagon his daughter Patty ! hristened the " Prairie Parlor Car , " and with his rife and children and mother-in-law and teamters set out for California . In Independence he tinted up with the wagons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other lagons going west , to make a train . Some then ailed it the Donner-Reed Party ; the Donner ' arty , we call it now . Clyman could not have known , as he wrote eside the grave in Kansas , the horrors that the ? onner Party would meet at the barricade of the Terra Nevada ( could not have known that of 83who reached the mountains just as the first blizzard of Sierra winter broke only 48 would survive , that Reed would kill a man and be banished and out of the banishment build an army of rescue to save those who banished him , that some among the Party would descend to cannibalism to spare themselves certain starvation , or that the Dormers would give their name to the great Pass of California emigration ) , but he knew his own dangerous journeys through the mountains and knew his own restless searching for strange novelties and knew tile American temper . Today 's Interstate 80 , straightened somewhat , still follows the Donner trail from Salt Lake City to Sacramento . So does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lung trail , still unsettled , still exploring . Only two generations , 124 years , separate us from the Donner Party 's excursion of 1846 , and one generation more , seventy years , returns us to the American Revolution . Some among the Donner Party were children on our first Fourth of July . One of the Donner Party 's grandchildren is alive today . Once a year she visits Sutter 's Fort to see the doll that her mother , Patty Reed , carried secretly down from the death camp in the Sierra . Clyman 's generic , always on the strech , became Thoreau 's specific . " Eastward I go only by force , " the isolate New Englander wrote in Walden , " but westward I go free . " He thought his forests extended to the setting sun , but larger landscapes lay west . Ten thousand years before a New England pond became our metaphor for life lived in the natural world , a great lake covered western Utah , southern Idaho , and eastern Nevada , and the land that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water . Then the level of the lake 's water fell below the level of its outlet and it began to dry up , leaving , today , salty Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake to preserve its bitter dregs . The shoreline of Lake Bonneville , as it came to be called , still runs for hundreds of miles high up in the mountainsides . Emigrants used that shoreline in places for a natural road . Early explorers mistook Lake Bonneville 's salty remains for an inland extension of the Pacific Ocean , and searched in vain for a salt river flowing west . They found none , did not for years comprehend that west of Utah rivers do not flow , as rivers ought , to the sea , but spread out into alkaline sinks where their waters evaporate into the desert air . Clyman knew , another strange novelty . And earlier still , a massive faulting of the earth 's crust forced the edge of Nevada down below California and thrust up the Sierra Nevada , sheerest of mountain ranges . Gabriel might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would walk across those mountains ? Yet farmers and businessmen did , and so did the children , only a child and a grandchild ago . Old geology . It should remind us of where we are , and how recently we came here , and how tentatively we have settled . The astronauts ' clever photographs are deceiving : from any near vantage , our planet is n't small . We live on its surface as ants might live in a penthouse garden , relying on its first six feet of soil to sustain us , tunneling not much further down for our minerals and oils . We live on the broad floors of old seas , or crowd together on shores worn away from ancient hills , or watch the sun rise late and set early high mountains that are yet mere cracks earth 's thick mantle , and below that mantle an ocean of oceans of basal magma and iron . Oozing up from cracks deep in the floors of our seas , those heavy liquids move our continents around as easily as flowing water moves autumn leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can not , short of memory as we are , comprehend . The earth was here before us , and will remain after we are gone . We are not poisoning it : we are only poisoning that part of it which sustains us on its surface . For some unknown object never to be realized even by those the most fortunate . IOSEPH SMITH OF NEW YORK DISCOVERED Amer- Itj ica , a place of latter-day saints . He could not believe so rich a continent had no human past . The visions came easy , the visits with the angel , the stone box half buried on a hillside , the plates of gold and brass . Easy to record them , even tedious as they crowded on . The history of a people from B.C. 600 to A.D. 421 . How they left Jerusalem , wandered the wilderness , built a boat , sailed to America , founded cities and nations . How Christ came here and showed the people his wounds and delivered again his parables , his Sermon on the Mount . The people straying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and farms . The plates sealed up in the box on the hillside . A few of the people surviving , forgetting their knowledge of iron and the wheel , becoming savages , becoming Indians . Their traces in the lower continent , the Aztecs , the Incas . An entire human history in the New World sprung from Smith 's visions and then the evidence concealed . God flinging a city to the bottom of the ocean or underneath a mountain with a flourish of Smith 's pen . It is as if William Blake sat in upstate New York envisioning his Prophetic Books , but Blake had no church rich in property and followers grow up to honor him . It needed Americans to believe such visions , to become Latter-day Saints . It needed a history of the land they would occupy large as the land itself and Jesus brought over on a thunderbolt to bless it . The Saints marched into Utah on a trail the Donner Party cut . Cut , twenty able-bodied men , swearing and sore , through the Wasatch Mountains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced their oxen and their wagons up a steep canyonside rather than cut more . The Saints came over the mountains to a desolate val . ley where one lone nee grew beside a lake of salt , a valley desolate enough , Brigham Young hoped , that no I me would ever bother them again , Smith murdered in Missouri in the Carthage jail , riots in Independence , riots in Illinois . The Saints made the desert green , a fertile hideout . A pall of smoke suspended on the cold lake air covers the Great Salt Lake , waste from the smelting stacks of the Kennecott Copper Corporation dug like an amphitheater for giants into the hills at the lake 's south shore , waste from the stacks of a steel mill twenty miles down the road , waste froir automobiles moving steadily up and down the val . ley . The guide at the beach says no one can touch Kennecott Copper , the state 's biggest taxpayer . blot the steel mill , apparently . You could buy this state for a million dollars , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Coors beer . The lone tree the Saints found in the valley , a businesswoman says was chopped up and sold in pieces to raise funds Her son will be a missionary for two years , car rying the story of the Saints to the Gentiles be yond the valley . Kennecott Copper 's two stack : could be filtered for less than twenty milliot dollars . The peaks of the Wasatch gleam with snow , : landscape of glory for the city socketed into thei foothills , fine houses on the foothills , a golden temple in the heart of the city . This is the Brigham Young said when he saw it , fresh from a briefing with Jim Bridger . Fish from the mountain streams die in the Salt Lake and wash up on its shores , trout , catfish . Only brine shrimp live in the lake , thousands of tons seined out annually and boiled up to make tropical-fish food for America and the world . The Donner Party camped on the lake 's south shore by twenty curious wells , holes in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again when you dipped water from them . A man from California told the Party to cross the desert straight instead of going around . The Saints , coming over the next year , crossed no desert , staved east of it and made their portion green . Copper ore is sold at the beach of the Great Salt Lake , and jars of perfectly spherical sand , and crystals of salt . On an island in the lake a pleasure palace sits empty and rotting , its great roller coaster long ago burned down , and on another island buffalo and antelope forage on the edge of the strange water . In the city , on a weekend , a party of married couples getting away from home and children check in at our motel and lie long afternoons beside the blue pool eating pizza and drinking beer . We ask one of the couples to dinner in our room , order hors d'oeuvres , and some unknown chef , bored on a Sunday night in Salt Lake City , makes up a mammoth tray of shrimp and olives arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner enough , and the talk is good of Saints and sinners . Beside the gray and turgid lake you lick salt from the back of your hand and find no seashells on the shore . Its salinity reached its maximum in 1953 . It is fresher now , a little fresher . Kennecott Copper muzzles in the earth , throwing back humps of black slag . On a holiday they close the liquor stores in Salt Lake City . The Wasatch water the valley , keep the golf courses green , guard the eastern flank . Moroni and Mormon , lead Americans now become angels , keep watch . Here Christ will come again in glory and lay the ; gentiles low . O N THE GREAT SALT DESERT , lakes of our imag- ining floated above the black highway and pread across the white salt to our north and outh . On the Great Salt Desert , William Eddy of he Donner Party saw twenty William Eddys tumbling before him on the second day , and the xerr 's feet broke through the salt crust to the hit-rr waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Donner Party , must have known , knew hat was in store fur them . They crossed the esert in September , following the Californian 's &leading; trail , and saw their two-day forced larch stretch into three and then into four . James eed lost his Prairie Parlor Car and all his goods id most of his oxen . The shoreline of Lake Bontville looked ironically down . At a new rest slam in the salt flats two highway engineers who rew their history well pointed out Pilot 's Peak us , the peak toward which the Donner Party id driven , theta walked , then stumbled and run , knowing at last that water was even farther from them than that distant hill . The desert spreads inviolate beyond the highway . The trails of the Donner wagons still scrape it in their antique ruts . It is a giant bone , the earth 's skull scalped and bleached by the Indian sun , and the air above it shimmers with the hallucinations a dying skull might bleed . It humbles men now once it broke them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crouching animal inside their own skulls . To leave that landscape , to drive up into treeless and sage-covered hills , and to encounter then , at the Nevada line , a flourishing casino , was to see again how we perch , birds on a twittering machine , atop the surface of the earth . in a land of endless sun we found people pale as cave dwellers pulling and pulling on the tireless and cynical levers of chromed machines . Children hang so on their mothers ' arms , receiving as irregularly a coin or two of quiet . We ate quickly and drove ahead , crossing most of Nevada the same day . The highway rolls out straight as a wire until it approaches a mountain , curves then around it in a faultless curve , and runs straight again to the next mountain . Ground squirrels , nothing better to do , fling themselves at your car , and occasionally a small town exits off the Interstate . Painted cattle-guards police the exits , but no cattle can be seen , nor even sheep , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , the mountains around which the Donner Party wandered desperate and dry for half of October while the nights grew cold . In Nevada small towns paint their names gigantically on mountainsides , the Interstate narrows to two lanes and creeps through the centers of towns to sustain the trade , and outside the towns there is land to burn if anyone cared to burn it . The Sierra , the continent 's western barricade , robs Nevada of water and robs it thus of life . And since Americans live there , they respond by bringing in the shining machines that supply Nevada with its greatest natural resource , gambled coin . Nevada maintains its perfect highways because they lead to only two places , to Las Vegas and to Reno , both sited just below the Sierra to entice Californians eastward over the mountains again . By such craft the state has achieved what few other states in the Union have even dared to consider : it has preserved much of itself as a natural wilderness , free even today from the heavy taint of man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress , we ate , we slept , and then we went on , soon to meet the Truckee River east of Reno , a silver latchstring hung out all the way from Lake Tahoe to guide us , if the great wire of the highway were n't enough . lrylHE TRUCKEE WINDS AND TWISTS AND TURNS , a I rush of clear water descending to arid Nevada from Lake Tahoe , that sample Bonneville high in the Sierra . In the Donners ' day , explorers thought the river was outlet to what was then called Truckee Lake , the lake to which the Donners later gave their name and around which they camped that fatal winter of 1846 . Truckee , kindly Indian chief , one of Nevada 's original settlers , told parties of emigrants to follow the river to the high lake ; beyond the lake rose the Pass over which thousands of Americans would cross to California . Now the river is Truckee and the little logging town just east of the lake is Truckee , and the lake is Donner and the Pass is Donner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Emigrants ' for all the history it has seen . Tragedy has its reward , poor enough pay for the suffering the Donner Party endured . Truckee Meadows , where the Party camped too long so that they could recruit their hungry oxen , is now Reno , and hardly a blade of grass in sight but , higher up , the older landscape remains much as it was a hundred years ago , altered only by the broad fills and cuts of the Interstate . Beside the highway , at a point three miles west of Truckee , rest still the remains of one cabin 's worth of Donner emigrants , a little hatch of a bronze marker clamped down over their heads , and the cars and trucks speed by . So we live , in layers , never having been a people to fool with skulls , memento mori , on the mantelpiece . We stayed at Lake Tahoe , in a pleasant cabin with an electric blue roof , all but alone at the end of the winter off-season . The lake exacts its tributes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and blue that you can see the Sierra 's granite boulders 30 feet below the surface in the sloping bottom off the shore . A Sierra lake is no child 's ivading pool , certainly not this huge one filled up from the base of the mountains . Fifty years ago , entrepreneurs carted two oceangoing steamships up the mountainside and assembled them at Lake Tahoe . Both now lie sunk at the bottom of the lake , oceangoing or not . One imagines Tahoe in wintertime , gray and chill while the Sierra snowstorms batter it and pile fifteen feet of snow on its shores , its waters a frigid 39 degrees . The Donners were wise not to have visited it ; with their luck they would have fallen in . But in early summer it blooms into beauty , its shores yellow with pine pollen . On one of its beaches my children built a city of miniature rivers and houses and cars , a water-soluble imitation of what developers with the best of intentions and an eye for harmonious design are doing to Tahoe 's North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of casinos and bars . The North Shore outran its sewage-treatment capacity a year ago and has lately held up building disavow : they could hardly wander without them , unaccustomed to the work of walking . They seem , there in the cold mountains , most forlorn , acting out guerrilla theater on the roads and beaches , skirmishing at the safe edges of an invisible war , the boy shuffling down the middle of the road grudgingly moving to the grade to let a car go by , the boy sticking out his tongue next to the restaurant window at the businessman glaring at him from inside , the teen-age girls bravely following their older men and bearing because they must the angry or lustful stares of the middle-aged men who pass them on the sidewalks . They live as they live because it is possible to live that way in America today , despite their rhetoric of revolution . Theirs is no revolution but a marginal retreat , a simple and old-fashioned pulling of fat off the continent 's incredible bounty . Their sadness , their despair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of how to achieve it or of interest in the achieving , testify to their acceptance of the world as it is . They exist in a state of psychic hibernation , awaiting some better age . Each day I drove over a mountain from Tahoe to Truckee and beyond Truckee to Donner State Park , wondering , as I have wondered since I began iliinking of the - tonner Party as some archetypal America in a ni - tor mode , what led this inexperienced group ol prosperous farmers and businessmen to brave st terrible a journey . California 's fertility could not have been enough : they lived in fertile Illinois and Missouri to begin with . Then I paced off the distance between the cabins . The Donner Party reached Truckee Lake in the first hours of a snowstorm that would bury the Pass in thirty feet of snow , and the ground around the lake in fifteen . They found a cabin left behind by young Moses Shallenberg.er two years before when he had been forced by similar snow to camp at the lake for two lonely months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an addition to that cabin and two other cabins nearby . They panicked ; they knew their doom ; they huddled together there on the mountainside . Yet two of the three cabins at the lake are spaced more than seven hundred feet apart , and the third more than a mile from its nearest neighbor . But assume for the sake of argument that the families who built those cabins so far apart did so from motives of distrust . George and Jacob Donner , two brothers who had lived and worked side by side all their lives , certainly had no reason to distrust each other . Forced to halt a few miles away from the other families , at Alder Creek , with no time to build cabins , they yet chose to set up their tents more than four hun dred feet apart across the creek . They could hav ( gathered wood for only one fire , could have cooked one common meal , could have shared the work of nursing . They chose not to , driven ever in their extremity to put distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ter ritory was vaster than ours , and if you accept the assumption then you must also accept the assumption that some subtle process of erosion , some anonymous compulsion of nerve and blood and insensibility , has released us from their need for territory and enabled us to live in crowded cities and breathe poisoned air and jostle each other almost beyond endurance , And taught us to prefer it . Nor can the process be reversed ( though it might he modifiedl even if the people in our cities already knew the lifetime of skills necessary to live off the land . Having been , as a child , something of an amateur pyromaniac , I have liked lately to daydream of a benevolent nationwide conflagration , government sponsored and approved , where we all get together and burn down our cities and start over. * But we could n't make it , if only because we have completely polluted our national water supply . I had the advantage of the fishermen and campers who go to Donner State Park , for I had visited it before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could people it with ghosts : Moses Shallenberger trying manfully to eat coyote and giving up in disgust ; Patty Reed playing with her doll and eating strips of rancid hide pulled off the fire rug ; Louis Keseberg , dark Bavarian , growling in his cave of a cabin mumbling human bones ; Patrick Breen coldly refusing food to others and noting the progress of madness and death like a recording angel ; and over them all , the white burial of the Sierra snow . Oh , they were modern enough , people who decided , having read a book and heard a story or two , to go to California , a journey they undertook as casually as one might say , let 's go to the lake , or let 's go into town , when in fact they might have said let 's go to Tibet or the Amazon , they were that innocent of what such a journey entailed , that convinced that God in his wisdom would preserve anyone American by birth or American by choice from harm . And on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad advice because the source of the advice had a necktie on , they ? many of them ? refused to share with each other when the need was upon them , and so half of : hem died most horribly of exposure and starva- , ion . Yet they were also not modern , revealed he coarse soil of their birth , the toughness of the - ural tradition in which most of them grew up : if 89 people , half of them children , 41 dead be-ore they achieved the winter passage , none cornnitted suicide : preferred slow death by starvation o suicide , preferred cannibalism to suicide . That act alone must stagger us today with its implicaons of strength and of trust in the ultimate beevolence of life . There is no reason to believe we ick that strength and trust today , though we tight have to dig for it . We may well need it bere we are through . */ similar vision , it seems , animates the Japanese ehiteet Kenzo Tange. whose new master plan for Tokyo , city of some 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and building a new one . ? - 1 1 W N SAN FRANCISCO , COME DOWN FROM the moonI tains late on a Wednesday morning , we checked into a motel at the edge of Chinatown and , as soon as we could , boarded a cable car for Fisherman 's Wharf . The afternoon was to be the children 's , but it became ours also . Even in early June , the Wharf was crowded with tourists come to eat shrimp and crab and to play in that adult playground . On the sidewalks , protected by wooden roofs , vendors sold paper cups of shrimp and displayed pale coral crabs . Green lobsters struggled to find footing on beds of shaved ice , and over it all blew the air of the salt and iodine sea . Behind the row of restaurants , on the wharf itself , fishermen coiled their lines in wicker baskets . Near the launch ramp , where a dredge worked to deepen the channel , a charter boat loaded longhaired Indians for the ride to Alcatraz , the island they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf behind them expelled gusts of garlic , so that they seemed launched on an aromatic breeze to their labor of reclamation . " Did you see the Indians ? " asked our Italian waiter at Alioto 's , as any Westerner might have asked any stranger come into town a hundred years ago . Yes , said the children , gravely coiling spaghetti onto soup spoons , we did . They seemed disappointed that Alcatraz 's free occupants had no feathered headdresses on . an oversight in their education I have worked to correct . After lunch we boarded ? receiving ticket stubs from a bearded sailor ? the Balclutha , a nineteenth-century iron square.rigger now permanently docked at the Wharf . She whaled ; she traded ; she grained ; she fought her way around Cape Horn ; she made the Alaska run and carried tall timber to the shipyards of New England ; she ran aground off the Alaskan coast ; finally the San Francisco Maritime Association fitted her out as a floating museum . My Midwestern children , who had never been aboard anything larger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang the ship 's bells , pulled the great wheel , winched the anchor winch , and clattered through the decks to the hold , still stocked with wooden crates and ballast barrels . The Balclutha shone with varnished railings and hand-pegged floors and smelled of pitch and brass and hemp and iron . She must have been a fine ship for sailors , built in Scotland after that country 's forests were gone , her great iron mainmast buried like a challenge thrown down from heaven to the very basilica of the hull . Melville 's massive blubber hooks hung on one deck , and a once-obscene bas-relief from naughty San Francisco leaned nearby , a nymph and satyr disporting sans genitalia , their mutilation decreed by a decency committee long ago . Whatever their public image , the Victorians of America and of Europe were in some ways far less prudish than we . Which of us could cut up a whale , or live at night with the smell of our own urine and night soil urging up from under our beds ? They lived ? the sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trade ? harder than we , and did it younger . Their portraits ? the Balclutha displayed many ? they took seriously , men in black with moustaches and beards grown early to hide their youthfulness , frowning as manfully as they could muster out at the varnished wooden box of the camera . If they seem larger than life now , it is because they tried to be larger than life then , braving the deserts and mountains and seas they crossed , braving the loss of their young to any disease that casualed by , braving surgery without anesthesia and love driven through a convention of last names between even man and wife . Yet the Balclutha would have given them security within her iron hull ; she floats today , docked next to the feeble tin machines parked on the street , as a monument to a time when a few things at least were built to last . We left her reluctantly , my wife and I , both of us in love with the sea . The children raced down the ramp under the baleful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk touring we stopped to drink at a German bar where a black myna predictably named Blackie perched in a cage above the smoke whistling at the patrons and obviously convinced that he was in charge , since after all he hung high above the rest of us , Father Mapple in ecclesiastical black with a sermon or two in his craw . An entertainer in lederhosen played an electronic accordion , and standing at the bar a young German , blond and blue-eyed and muscular , put his dimpled chin in the air and closed his eyes and not so much heard as smelled , breathed , the polkas and edelweiss and Danubes the accordion evoked . He might hal . e been standing in an Alpine ski lodge in 1938 savoring empire . Along the way to the bar the children had acquired monumental all-day suckers ; they licked them gravely and looked around to eyes that honored their sun-bleached hair . Most of the people in the bar were heavy , filling the narrow chairs and barstools to overflowing , yet the heaviness implied muscle as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to San Francisco drinking deeply of the Old Country on a sunny Wednesday afternoon ? If Fisherman 's Wharf were in Disneyland they would have been animated plastic Germans with coloring too high along the cheeks and a tendency to practical jokes , but this was San Francisco and the people were real . On then , on this tour of people 's museums , to the Wax Museum , with figures courtesy Madame Tussaud 's . We might have visited many uplifting places in San Francisco , I know , but we were savoring the vernacular this trip . Whatever recent judgment the outside world has rendered , in the museum you may still adore Jack and Jackie , Jack standing there next to George Washington looking like Peter Marshall delivering a Senate prayer , Jackie plain in a black suit , white gloves in hand , her hemline unfashionably below the knee . Eleanor bravely behind Franklin seated in a chair , and in the limelight , between the flags of the Presidency and the nation , Lyndon Baines Johnson .

The museum has its basement , just as we do just as the Donner Party did , that place wher fantasy rims into nightmare . except that the basement is as real for the race as it was for the Donners , pure violence acted out in the name , usually , of the Higher Law . In the museum , heads roll from the guillotine to make official the French Enlightenment , the rack stretches another Spanish heretic in the name of the Church , a man screams silently from the double hook on which he hangs live in the name of Allah .

It is a most allegorical museum , we discovered then , because up from the basement of horror , past the street level of distinguished and notorious humanity , we ascended on carpeted stairs to a hall of religions , there to be treated , with music appropriate to a California mausoleum , to the religious leaders of the ages : irritable Moses examining a tablet of Commandments , Buddha in his garden , Christ at the Last Supper ( holding , as do the Twelve , an empty glass tumbler of the sort motels provide ) , and , in another diorama , delivering the Sermon on the Mount to an unlikely collection of auditors , a turbaned African , a pale and aged Nordic who might have fled from a Bergman set and shriveled under a Bergman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth gathered together as if Norman Rockwell had cast them for the part . It is enough for us ; we leave the way we came , a wax guard directing us to the exit . On then , to placate the boy , to Ripley 's Believe It or Not Museum , and here , as on the Balclutha , I am home . So many American children , in those days that seem now so long ago , during and before World War II , grew up on Ripley 's and Richard Halliburton arid Tom Swift . Ripley 's was not some Precambrian game of trivia to us , but the only kind of history we respected , a history of fabulae , a history of the follies and monstrosities of mankind . We knew , listening to the grown-ups talk Depression and then war , that the world was strange and more than a little bizarre ; Ripley brought the truth home to us in concrete examples we could trust .

Of course we believed it , as we believed the tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorer and a gorilla , a half-human blond man-ape still roaming the African jungle , or of the suppression of Tucker 's futuristic car by a jealous General Motors , or of the appearance of flying saucers in the sky .

We did n't do much more , although we did it more intricately : we carved 364-foot wooden chains from a solid pine board , or fleshed out a full-color Last Supper painted in postage stamps , or dried apples to create wizened doll faces , or made typewriter paintings , fish-scale flowers , nut sculptures , or stitched clothes for fleas . You can not visit Ripley 's without concluding that the human animal will do almost anything to fill time . It is n't the Puritan ethic ; it 's the way our brains work . The Orientals keep as busy , if Ripley 's ponderous Oriental collection is any measure : grow giants who write fairy talcs and midgets with I3-foot queues , drill holes in their heads to carry candles on the night watch , construct wheels to add up chits in heaven , carve ivory or cherry-tree roots .

W E HAD COME WEST , WE THOUGHT , TO mt . but no American ever went west to visi he went west to find a wilderness of his own . VI found ours at last , three hours south of Sz Francisco , but to understand what we found yr must understand what wilderness once was , in California and in America . John Muir , knowing that it was already behind him , described one version of it : When California was wild , it was one sweet bee-garden throughout its entire length . . zones of polleny forests , zones of flowery chaparral , stream tangles of rebus and wild rose , sheets of golden compositae , beds of violets , beds of mint , beds of bryanthus and clover , and so on , certain species blooming somewhere all the year round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of March , April , and May , was one smooth , continuous bed of honey bloom , so marvelously rich that , in walking from one end of it to the other , a distance of more than four hundred miles , your loot would press about a hundred flowers at every step . This is one wilderness today , one wilderness 1970 , where at last we came : Punta de los Lobos Marinos , point of the sea wolves : Point Lobos , a state reserve just south of Carme ? by-the-Sea on the Monterey Peninsula down the coast from San Francisco : 1,250 acres that one literate visitor called " the greatest meeting of land and water in the world . " You drive through a simple entrance into pines . The cool air forces your windows clown . A ranger takes your car fee and gives you a brochure . You drive a shaded road , slowly , thinking yourself in an ordinary park , and then a wary but unfrightened doe stands suddenly in the road before you , looks back over her fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadway , casually moves on . At a circle of gravel you park , get out , take a foot trail toward the point . Wildflowers grow so thick that you can not see the ground and the surf crashes through narrow caves and canyons to break before you far from the shore . Sea otters bark from their island off the point , and at some seasons , the brochure says , you may watch gray whales glide past you to a union far to the south , a union that is no concern of yours . The blue sky races mirages of sail overhead , puffs angling on a fleecy tack . Ground squirrels feed from your hand . The rare Monterey cypresses , gnarled by ocean storm , black out fantastic shapes against the sky , a man erect dancing with three naiads , a lust of matted hair , skeinings of branches , gray-bleached skeletons of tangled limbs . Red rock layered with charcoal , the strata of dried oceans rise up to remind you of the planet 's age , carvings of rock subtler and bolder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carvings of men , and breaking against them , carvings of water , the spume flashing in the sun , that humble you with their indifference to permanence , their casual indifference to passing time . You leave the rocky point and return to the path , and realize then that in this wilderness of 1970 you are hound within wire-edged walkways , pledged not to pick one flower or disturb one stone , to harm no creature , to smoke no cigarette , hardly to breathe if you can help it . And realize that we are now what we always were : creatures who should not be allowed to touch a wilderness because , having touched it , we will destroy it it we possibly can , So we are not of the wilderness . however much you , I , all of us may yearn for it We are not Indians gliding through the forest . Ws are , whatever the evolutionists may say , some ye unexplained separate creation , most bloody ant until recently most unbowed . The Indians whorl Sutter sent out to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew agar from the Forlorn Hope , the first gang of Don ners to cross the Winter Pass , when they saw ths Hope eating each other ; could not comprehend race of people who would sink even in starvation to what the Indians thought such depravity ; am for their gentle qualification Luis and Salvado : were shot and eaten in their turn . And wired away now from our wildernesse. , , realizing as a murderer must realize after the ac of murder how completely we have destroyed wha we most deeply loved , we decide that the time ha come for the destroying to stop . Because now Donners all , we understand that we are destroyin ; the one creature who really matters : ourselves each other , the man or woman or child or children : we love . The water is full of mercury and arsenic the air of monoxide and lead , DDT builds up i our bones , and radioactive iodine in the gland of our children . And the wilderness is guarde by wires . And now that we know we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having bee red before as a night battlefield flared by fate shells . Now we go to green . become conservatior ists , docile and humane . Now we are signatoric of the whole earth . It has got to be the irony t end all ironies , this docile greenness lately sprun among our consciences . Our very teeth , incisor and canines and bovine molars , attest our ambb alence . Why , we are the Vietcong of the Wester world , tooth and fang lately bared for quietud The Donners did n't brave the Sierra for bravery sake , nor for glory 's ; they merely thought it the natural right to ride into wild California and mal farms and factories where there had been r farms and factories before . They strike terror us even today because they did n't , as we have fl two hundred years routinely done , merely rape tl wilderness that spraddled before them , but suffer ( it like animals . Whatever the Sierra Club says , the wilderne wo n't save us , is not the preservation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a other pets , but wo n't preserve us . We will mal the continent a garden , not a wilderness , or I will make it nothing at all . Because we want get on with facing the real wilderness , the on one that has ever challenged us , the wilderness our own brains . That is the one that is always the strech . It promises Sierras that beggar imr ining.
