I stayed kneeling and crouched beside her just listening to her cry and trying to hold her head steady so it would n't hurt . Finally they had come to the room and put the head of the bed on blocks and put her neck in traction , and then gone over the extremities of her body with pins . " Do you feel that ? " And finally they had put her to sleep . The apartment was dark and stuffy . We faced south over some lovely gardens , but in the late afternoon the rooms were full of shadows . I opened the windows in the living room . The plants were all right , and everything was tidy . Alice came in half a day a week . A note from her . " Dear Mr. L , I 'm so sorry . She was such a nice lady . If you need me extra , just call . " I took the suitcase with the letters into the second bedroom , which I used as a study , and then I took the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The head was still up on blocks for the traction device . I suddenly realized that I would have to sleep in that bed . In the country I had slept in my study since Fran had died , but there was no bed in the study here . Well , there had to be a first time . That 's what I was there for . I went back to the living room to the bar table and took a swig of gin from the bottle . Fran used to kid about that . In England when I would complain about the weaknessof the martinis , she would laugh and say , " You 're no judge . Why do n't you just ask for a bottle and a straw ? " It was inevitable that for a while everything I did or touched or saw immediately associated with Fran . After all , these were all our things . Each piece had a history of some sort , pleasant or unpleasant . I looked at a lamp I violentlydisliked and had raised a row over because it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even more now because my hating it then had made Fran cry . Why the hell had I done that ? Why had n't I let her do the apartment the way she wanted to ? Why was I al/ways warning about the chancy nature of our careers ? " We ca n't live as well as we might like today so that we wo n't ever have to live as poor as we may be some years from now . " God , I hated the sound of my own voice , remembering . Where had that come from ? My father : " I have made it a practice always to try to save about half of what I earn . " And he had made me do that as a boy with my allowance , and later when I had earned my own money , I had saved what I could . And it had been a damned good idea . It had seen us through these years of sickness when nothing much was coming in . I hated the self-serving , self-righteous way my thoughts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't as though we had stinted in any large sense . After we had started earning money , we had had a lot of things . But they were never enough for Fran . Fran always liked first class . Why the hell had n't I let her have what she wanted ? I went to the study and turned on my desk light and pulled the shades at the windows . Habit , writing habit , to shut out the sun or the rain or the snow . Without sitting down , I took out the letters and telegrams and flower cards and stacked them to one side . I stood looking at the picture that it made  --  paper , pens , pencils , warm light . It was a picture that I liked , that I could create any place in ' the world . It was my place of work , a brightly warm and invitingspot in a shadowy room . But I did n't sit down . I heard the city through the open windows , and something in me wanted to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Fran would want to lie down and rest after the trip , and I would want to hit the streets . I turned out the light , raised the shades , and left the apartment with a guilty sense of relief.  |p78I  made Bloomingdale 's my destination . ( My father had always said , " Do n't amble . Always walk as though you had a destination . " ) Bloomingdale 's had been my walking area for years . I rarely bought anything . I just walked through every floor . It was a covered , all-weather bazaar with enough varied activityand things of interest to take my mind off my work . In the early days Fran and I had walked through the store many times together on winter Saturday afternoons , often bringing home something utterly useless , just to buy something . I used to say that Fran hated to go to museums because there was nothing she could buy . She always had to bring home a favor from the party.  |p79Now  each young couple drifting aimlessly through the store , arms loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After buying a few things , I headed back to the apartment . Some letter paper for the notes I was writing , and a large photograph album . I had taken a great many pictures of Fran during the last four or five years . Movies too . When I knew that she was going to die , I went out and bought new cameras , and started taking pictures of her on all occasions . I had also bought a tape recorder . It had all been a desperate effort to save any part of her I could . Friends and students were beginning to send the snapshots they had taken . I could not yet look at the pictures or play the tapes . But one day I would . Back at the apartment , there was a stack of mail in front of my door with a note from the couple on the floor below . " We heard you come in but did n't want to disturb you . We are so sorry . " That was a true city dweller . I opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the light and glanced at some of the envelopes . Just the return names and addresses , some from abroad , touched me . But I did n't want to read the letters or go into all that now . I felt drowsy , without pills , and I wanted to take advantage of it . I lay down on the couch in the living room , putting a piece of newspaper under my feet and a light throw over my legs . ( Fran 's instructions . ) It had always amused Fran that I took naps on couches rather than on beds . For me , lying on a bed was too positive an act . It scared away sleep . You 're supposed to sleep . No sleep ! There was something more like stealing sleep on a couch , holding a newspaper for a few moments and being surprised by sleep . I dozed off quickly . When I woke up , it was getting dark outside . Lying there , really wishing I could just slip back into sleep , I looked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners , making cocktails , one woman dressing . I had looked at her before with amusementand curiosity . She always pulled the shade eventually , but it never seemed to occur to her until she was almostdown to her skin . Tonight she filled me with loneliness and longing . " Get out and see people . " It was Fran 's voice . " You should n't just sit around when I 'm not here . It makes me feel awful , leaving you the way I have to . . . " " . . . I like to be alone . " And that had been true , to a certain extent . Always , of course , with the knowledge that I was not absolutely alone . Fran was someplace . How much I had been dependent on her to create activity in my life ! I had very few men friends . We had friends together whom we enjoyed together . But if I were alone in the city or in the country , I would n't call a friend for lunch or dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . The telephone rang . I had sworn not to answer phones this weekend . I had come here not to answer phones . It stopped . It occurred to me it might be Jean . Though I had not sent the telegram , sooner or later she would hear and get in touch . It rang again . Automatically I reached for it . That had been Fran 's signal . To ring , hang up and call back immediately . It was my lawyer and oldest friend , Roger . " I 've been trying to reach you . " " I drove in this afternoon . " " Oh . How about coming over for dinner . We 're going to sit down in a few minutes . Just us . " " No , thanks , Roger . I just want to be alone . Get caught up . " " You could just come for dinner and leave when you want . " " Thanks , Roger . " A pause . " Are you sure ? "  | " I 'm sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything at first . " How about lunch then on Monday . We have to go over the will and I have to make a date with the Internal Revenue to open Fran 's safety-deposit box . " " Really ? I 'd never heard of that . " " Yes . " " I do n't think you 'll find anything much in it . Everythingof any importance is in mine . . . I think . " " You have no idea what we find in these boxes . " " She had one in Boston too . She kept it for old times ' sake . " " Well , we can go over it all on Monday . One o'clock at the office ? " " Fine . " " Sure you wo n't come for dinner ? It smells very good and I 've got some Tanqueray gin . " " No , thanks . " " We have n't really seen you . . . to talk . " " I know . We will . " Each family of friends wanted their time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get the chance . " I 'm not sure it 's wise for you to be alone , Chris . " " I just seem to want to be . " " Well , if you change your mind , we 'll be in all eve-ning . " I went into the kitchen to see if there were any canned things I could eat . The phone rang again , and I stood in front of it and waited for it to stop , thinking all the time , " Who could it be ? " Undoubtedly some of the calls I had n't answered had been from Sarah . That would have to be faced . The kitchen was spick-and-span . Nobody had eaten there in a month . I opened the cupboard door and two cockroaches scampered across the shelf and down thep82crack in the back . In our first apartment in Boston , Fran and I had had cockroaches . When we went out at night , on our return we 'd each grab a handful of paper toweling and then turn on the light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard door , put on my jacket , and took a taxi to my club.  |p83As  I entered the club , the " one drink before catching the train " group was leaving . I checked my coat and went into the bar . Many of the faces I passed were familiar ; that is , I had seen them in the club for twenty years , but I had no idea of their names or they of mine . Some I recognized as classmates whom I had not known at college nor since . Fran had occupied most of my time at college . There were a few classmates whom I had known vaguely , and we always smiled and waved or shook hands and said " Hello , " but we never broke our stride or said anything more . I ordered my drink and went upstairs to the library . I sat in a large overstuffed leather chair in the dimlyp84lit book-lined room and looked through the newspaper . I had n't the slightest idea of what I was reading . It was like walking through the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last years . Turning the pages , relating to little or nothing . Marking time . I had related to little because I did n't really know who I was except a man waiting for his wife to die . I was about to put aside the paper when I read : New Hope For Cancer Cure . I broke out into a sweat . For years I had grabbed at any scrap of news about new treatments or possible cures . Now I did n't want there to be a cure . Not yet . Not so soon after Fran 's death . If this actually turned out to be a cure , and I had let her die . . . Reading on reluctantly , I was back in Fran 's bedroom that night , calling the ambulance and the doctor , and he had brought her around and she was alive and we would try this treatment , and . . . The investigators emphasized that this development does not mean an immediate breakthrough . It will be at least a year before the drug can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perversely relieved , and waited for my breathing to return to normal . Of course , even if they could stop the cancer , Fran 's bones could n't have been mended , the spine . She would be alive , but . . . I needed a drink . Leaving the library , I noticed an older man slumped asleep in one of the chairs , and anotheracross the way with ashes down the front of his shiny coat . I had remembered men like this , of course . I had seen them before when I had eaten a quick meal on the way to the theatre . But now I looked at them in a new light . They seemed utterly without resources . I had thought of coming back after dinner to browse among the books until it was time to go to bed . I decided I would n't . As I went down to the bar for a second drink , the clubp85had practically emptied except for men like those in the library , the nightly inhabitants . I decided I would have one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the apartment . I had letters to write . I had things to do , to occupy me . What had happened to these old men ? Were they widowers ? Old bachelors ? What ? Old men seemed so much more pitiful than old women . During the daytime I had never seemed to notice them among all the active , vigorous younger men , heading to and from the squash courts , laughing at the bar , rolling dice at the backgammon tables . This was the residue . Did they live at the club ? Did they have homes ? I would n't come back here alone . It would be better to cook somethingand eat it at home . I stepped into the bar . Nobody but the bartender at the far end of the bar , reading the newspaper . He got up as I entered , but I turned on my heel and decided to have my drink at the table . I entered the huge dining room and saw that there was only one old man , sitting at the long table which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked up at me with a hopeful smile . " I 'm looking for George Benson , " I lied . " Have you seen him ? " " No . I do n't think I know him . " " Thank you . " And I walked out , picked up my coat , and hurried out of the building . God ! Avoiding restaurants where I was known , I found a small place between Fifth and Madison where I had never been . Business was not particularly good , and I was seated at a small table along the wall . I ordered my drink and felt alone and awkward . Single people should really eat at home or at Schrafft 's or in a bean wagon on a stool . Could n't they find anyone to eat with ? My God , theyp86must really be creeps ! Or does he prefer to eat alone , and if so , he is more of a creep . I spread my napkin on my lap , and felt uncomfortable without a newspaper or magazine . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for it , it was n't there . It must be in another coat . I just had to sit there naked . I sipped my drink and tried not to feel sorry for myself . I had rigged it all this way , to be alone , as I had done so often in my life . There was no need for me to be alone . Across the room were three people , a man and two women , all in their late thirties . The women were talking animatedly . The man did n't seem very interested . Which one was the wife ? It was a game Fran and I had played often . One of the women turned and looked in my direction . She was beautiful . She laughed at something the other woman said , tossed her hair , and suddenly I desperatelywanted to touch her . She had dark hair , a wide face with a sensuous mouth , a womanly figure . I remembered how during the war , the night before I was to ship out of San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of me in the bus . I had wanted to reach out and touch her hair , to hold her head close to me . And now this woman . I stared at her unashamedly . I wanted to be enveloped by this woman . I wanted to be passive and have her make love to me . I wanted to be warmed by this unknown woman who was all woman and to tell her about Fran and how terrible it had all been . I continued to stare , and she looked away from her friend for a moment and looked at me . She had dark beautifuleyes . Could she have any thought of what 1 was thinking ? I wanted her to know . I continued to look . The curve of her breast under her sheer blouse made me wretchedly homesick for a woman 's body . As she talked , she seemed kind and responsive . I began to fantasize . She was not thep87wife . The others would have to leave early , and she would stay on . And what would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towards me . I continued looking at her for a long moment , then dropped my eyes to my glass and took a sip . My heart was beating rapidly . I wanted that woman desperately . In my anguish I had always turned to a woman . But this was more than anguish . True , the husband wanted comfort , but the man simply wanted the woman . I felt a warmth and excitement , and began to get an erection . I looked up again , and she was looking at me , just for a moment , then her glance went back to her friend and she answered some question . I continued to stare at her . She turned towards the man and said something to him . He looked over at me for the first time , and I flushed and looked away . After a moment I looked back casually , and the second woman had twisted around to look at me . The man looked sternly at me . From time to time after that , when I glanced at their table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would look away when I caught her at it . What would I do if she stayed behind ? I had never picked up a girl in my life , that is , in a public place . A certainongoing part of me was taking over . It was responding to the city and the situation and my need . Hunger had made me finally get out of bed that first morning alone . There was something rueful in my awareness of the paradoxesand contradictions . I lingered over my coffee . Perhaps they would leave first and she might cast a last look back . But they did n't leave , and I began to feel foolish dawdling over coffee . I looked at my watch . It was after nine . Safe to go home . Five to nine were the hours of anxiety when I was alone . After nine it was all right to go home to an empty apartment , buy a newspaper on the way , glance at it , have a couple of drinks , watch a few minutes of television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to have nothing to do between five and nine gave me a sense of panic . I would have to learn to cope with it . Start reading . How long I had hoped for time to read for myself , books I needed to read and wanted to read . The last years I never seemed to find the tune . Now I was alone and could read to my heart 's content . But somehow I did n't want to read alone in the apartment . I got up from the table , now risked a smile at the woman across the room , and handed the hatcheck girl my check . As I put on my raincoat , I looked hack , and the lady was looking at me . I left . Perhaps she was not the man 's wife . Perhaps if I had stayed . As I walked away , I thought I might go back to that restaurant another night . She might come there often . I felt excited . I had been " the gentleman in the restaurant . "  |p89Back  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , but I went into my study , turned on the desk lamp and created " my world " and started answeringthe letters , writing about the last years and Fran 's spirit and gallantry , and soon I had transferred my longing to Fran . After a couple of long letters , I was tired and drained of emotion . The phone rang , and I let it ring itself out . There could be no emergency that would involve me . David ? Yes , something could have happened to him , but he had Gretchen , and I doubted if I would be called until the emergency was over . Sarah ? I sat on the couch with my drink and put my feet onp90the coffee table . Of course I would have to start answering the phone and I would have to start making calls . What did other people do ? I started thinking of other people who had lost wives or husbands . I had some special friends , eight or ten years older than I was , and I always checked them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how they were holding up , how they were meeting various crises , success , failure , children , divorce , middle age . But in thinking about them , I had come to realize that death was not an abstraction but something that happened to individuals and individual relationships , and the reaction depended on the individual and his relationship to the person who had died . One friend had gone completely to pieces and had committed suicide . Another had shocked everyone by marrying immediately . I thought about that for a while . I could n't imagine standing up there and saying " I do . " In a strange way it would be a final death for Fran . She still lived as my wife . " My wife and I " was still Fran and I.And yet , what about my feelings for the woman in the restaurant ? That was something else . I closed my eyes and thought about her , her mouth , the curve of her breast , and suddenly she was naked and multiplied by ten , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engulfed in flesh . I got up and poured myself another drink and stared out the window . All the curtains were drawn . I stood over my desk , saw my address book and picked it up and went in and settled down on the couch again . The first page or two , there was nobody I wanted to call , to see . Had our lives been made up of keeping in touch with people we reallydid n't care about ? I could remember good and friendly times we had had with them all , but I did n't want to call them . I wanted something much more primitive or much more complex than I could find with friends.  |p91The  phone rang again , and I picked it up . It was Sarah . " I called earlier , but there was no answer . " " I was out . I 've just come in . " I was angry with her for calling , and thoroughly ashamed at being angry . I sounded distant and disinterested , and I was ashamed of that . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my troubles in a bath of sensuousness . She was ready to help me again . She could n't understand that though I desperatelyneeded to hold and be held , it was different now . Now there would be something ongoing about it , and I could n't feel that way about her . And I was angry with myselfall over again for having " used " her . " I tried to call you in the country this afternoon . " " Yes . I drove in this afternoon . " " Am I calling at the wrong time ? Is it embarrassing for you to talk to me now ? " What the hell did she mean ? That I would have someone else here with me now ? Some woman ? What was I getting upset about ? That 's what I wanted . Some image of a woman who did n't know me , who had n't known Fran , who would just listen to me say how much I had loved my wife and how lost I was and who would believe it all and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find myself in some complex way in her body . " What do you mean ? " " I just wondered from the way you sound . If someone else is there , I could call tomorrow . " " I 'm alone . " " Would you like to come over for a drink ? " " It 's late . " ( It had been late before when I had called urgently and had begged to be allowed to come over . ) " I 'm writing letters . You know . All the letters people wrote about Fran . " " You could get printed cards for that . " " I do n't seem to want to . "  | " You should n't sit around in that apartment alone . Could I come over tomorrow and cook you up some din-ner ? " I began to feel sorry for her , and I knew what happened when I felt sorry for a woman . Once , when I was a freshman in college , I had gone to a dime-a-dance place , and during one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no partner . Some men standing near me kidded each other , saying , " There she is . Just for you . " Anotherone said , " That dog ? " I thought she looked terribly lonely and hurt out there , and I went out and gave her my tickets and danced with her . Perhaps I am always projectingmy terror at loss of pride . Obviously this girl could n't have cared less that she was left alone . When she started to dance , she ground her belly and pelvis against me , chewinggum and looking the other way all the time . The whole thing had been ridiculous as she maneuvered me into a dark corner and ground herself into me until I had an orgasm . " Sarah , I 'd like to be alone this weekend . There have been so many people . " But at the same time I had a vision of the club and the restaurant alone . And I knew I would have to see her sometime to explain , to end it . " Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , do n't do that . " " I 've got a lot of manuscript reading to do anyway and I 'm finishing a new short story of my own . Just let me know in time so that I can get some food . My kitchen is being ripped apart , so it will have to be yours . " Sarah had not been to my apartment . Some nicety had kept me from letting her come . What I had done with her , I had done away from my life . It had no connection with my life . I did n't want her to come to my apartment now . " This place is a mess . The kitchen has n't been used for months . If we do anything , we 'd better eat out . "  | " I could come over early and clean it up . " " No . . . Look , Sarah , I really did come here to be alone with myself . Get through these letters . I do n't want to sound rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . " There was a pause at the other end . Normally I would have softened such harshness by saying , " We 'll do it later . " But I did n't . " If you do n't mind , I 'll check with you tomorrow . You 're walking wounded now , and by tomorrow night you may need someone to talk to . " Her nursing instincts sensed a sick person , wounded prey . I would need her desperately . Wounded people , ostracizedpeople , often became the willing prey of solicitouspeople they normally would n't spend time with . I decidedI could always just not answer the phone . " Okay . But if anything else definite comes up , do n't turn it down . " " Nothing else will come up . Do n't stay up all night writing those letters now . Go to bed . " " Okay . " " Good night . " And she hung up . I felt trapped and angry with myself for leaving the door open at all . I finished my drink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then call her back and say that I 'd just had a call from David , and I had to leave in the morning for Boston . But I knew I 'd have to handle the thing better than just running out . I finally decided that I would call her in the morning and invite her out to dinner . We 'd go to a small restaurant near her place in the Village , and we 'd talk , and that would be that . The few times when we 'd been together , we 'd always met at her apartment and stayed there . I did n't want to stay there this time . Anyway , she said her kitchen was torn apart . And I did n't want to be seen with her . I flushed with embarrassment . Why not be seen with her ? My God , it was obvious why not . My wife was dead ap94week , and here I was in the Village . . . But I was in the Village , was n't I ? So why should n't I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickened and confused me . What did I care what people thought ? I cared . It was vitally important to me and to Fran 's memory and the memory of " us " what people thought . I walked into the bedroom . I had forgotten to take the bed off the blocks before I went out . I did n't feel like doing it now . I also did not want to sleep in that bed . Not yet . The paradox of wanting to stay close and yet not too close . I moved a pillow into the living room , threw a blanketon the couch , and decided that for tonight at least , I 'd stay there . I took a couple of sleeping pills , undressed , and turned out the light , and thought about the woman in the restaurant , and let her make love to me till I went to sleep.  |p95Sarah  's street in the Village was depressing . This time I noticed it . Before I had just put my head down and hurried through the block . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I had stopped to buy a fifth . This time I did n't . The fifth had been necessary the other times . A drug to my conscience , a prelude to complete abandon , a bedside companion . This visit was going to be different . Other times there had been a tension , a driving sexual urgency which had tumbled us onto the bed with animal groans and clutching hands and arms . I felt no urgency now . Nothing . Only embarrassment which anesthetized me completely . She had said , " You always are so ready . You leave me nothing to do for you . . . Come over sometime when you are not so ready . Trust me ! " And she told me of a man who had been with her , who even though he stayed inside her , would insist on bringing himself around with his hand at the end . " So untrusting . Would you trust me ? Just lie there and trust me ? " I had told her I did n't know . I had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulting not to be ready from just the idea of the woman , the touch . Fran had given it significance too . Sarah said it was not trusting , not being willing to be really naked , and she said something I laughed at , but it was true . " A man with a hard-on is not naked . " I rang the hall bell , and after a few moments Sarah buzzed and I entered the building . The grime and peeling paint and smells of cooking depressed me . At the top of the stairs Sarah 's door was ajar . I knocked , and she called out , " Come in . " She was in the bedroom . " I was just changing . " Although Sarah had not done much to fix up her apartment , it was definitely a woman 's , and I felt both homesick and uncomfortable the minute I closed the door . Sarah came down the short dark narrow hall buttoningher blouse , a blouse that I had unbuttoned on other occasions . " You did n't say where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " She kissed me lightly on the lips . " I thought we might eat at the place around the corner . " I was not known in this neighborhood . It was unlikelythat we would meet anyone who might know me . " That place has dreadful food . " She buttoned her cuffs . " You know what I 'd like ? I 'd like to go to Lu-chow 's . " " I do n't know as I feel like anything that "  --  I hesi/tated  --  " that big , you know . " I was appealing to her understanding that I was n't emotionally ready for a big public place like that , while I knew what I meant , and was embarrassed . " I 'd just like to get out of the neighborhood . I know , what about Charles ? That 's quiet , and they have booths , so you would n't feel surrounded by a lot of people .

" The kitchen 's a mess , but the ice thing is working . I 'd like just some vermouth on the rocks . " I had hoped that we could have gone out immediately . The memories of my other visits to this place when I had wallowed in her bed were now too painful . I brought the drinks into the bedroom . She had taken off her blouse and was in her bra and skirt . " If we 're going to Charles , I 'd better put on somethinga little more fancy . " She turned and smiled at me as she raised her arms to slip into another blouse . If she had been any other woman , I would have taken her in my arms and we would have tumbled onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put her drink on the dressing table and sat in the one chair , behind and away from her . I wanted to go into the other room , but I could n't do this . " How are you getting along ?

"  |p98I  shrugged my shoulders . " I 'm just doing what I seem to want to do . And I seem to want to be alone . " I felt this was too unkind , so I added , " . . . Mostly . " " I 've read parts of the pamphlet you 've been writing on Fran and your marriage . " " Oh . I have n't finished it yet . " " Chuck gave it to me to read . " She looked at me in the mirror .

" " I never told you , but I once went with a man , a stage manager who had worked with Fran . He said she was nice . " I was offended by the tepid description " nice . " It seemed so insignificant for the Fran I had been remembering . I watched her put on her lipstick and remembered her carefully removing it so that it would not be on my shirt or neck , or " anywhere . " She looked somewhat like the woman in the restaurant , dark , lush , sensuous . I thought I could sec the large reddish-brown nipples through her blouse . It was just memory . She caught my eyes in the mirror and just sat there , perhaps waiting for me to come up behind her and cup her breasts and press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to reach for the zipper . After a moment she snapped off her dressing-table light and stood up . I helped her on with her coat . She said , " You look tired . You need taking care of . " As she opened the door , she noticed something on the bookcase . " Last time you were here , you forgot your pipe and tobacco . I meant to send it to you , but then felt it might . . . lead to prob/lems . " I reached for them . " You can take them when you come back . You do n't want to lug them around . " I had hoped to avoid coming back , and I paused for a moment , then said feebly , " I might want to smoke after dinner . " " A pipe at Charles ? You 'd better not . " I took them anyway , and we went down the stairs . I had never eaten at Charles with Fran , though I had been there a couple of times on business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our booth , I glanced quickly around the room to see if I recognized anyone . And I felt cheap doing it . After we had been served our drinks , Sarah looked at me and smiled . " You know , around the office there 's a great deal of speculation going on about you . " " What do you mean ? " " It 's not really appropriate to discuss now , but life goes on , and . . . anyway , they are wondering if you would get married again and who you might marry . " I frowned . She went on . " I know , but it 's inevitable . I went to a funerallast month , and as I came out , I , saw the widow being helped to her car by a male friend of long standing , and someone next to me said , That 's the new husband . ' Peopleare just that way . " I smiled at the gruesomeness of the story and shook my head . " I feel very much married to Fran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more married than before . A greater sense of responsibility . . . " I really did n't want to go into all this with Sarah , but it might help her to understandmy attitude towards her . She looked at me as though wondering if she should say what she was about to say . " Do you know Spender 's lines At first you did not love enough , And afterwards you loved too much . ' The first part does n't apply to you , as far as I know , but the last part is worth thinking about . "  |p100I  was upset at her constant small references to my feelings for Fran . " Maybe . " " It 'll make it very hard for a real live girl . " The waiter brought the menus . After we ordered , she went on . She could n't seem to get off the subject . " You have an interesting time ahead of you , do you know that ? " " What do you mean ? " " I was a very innocent girl when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I had my head in the sand . But when it blew up after five years , my eyes were opened . SuddenlyI was showered with luncheon invitations from my friends ' husbands . And I was on their lists to call when wife was out of town visiting family . More married men came scratching at my door . " I wondered if she realized how she was making me feel . She must have , because she went on . " Oh , you 're not included . I do n't mean the way you came . Please understandthat . You were different . " And she touched my hand . " But these others . I saw the underside of most of my friends ' marriages , and it was n't pretty . It 's given me a rather jaundiced view of marriage . " She sipped her drink . " I do n't know about you , Chris , but I do n't think I 'd ever try it again . I 'd settle for a nice long love affair . " She looked into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , I 'm being realistic , at thirty-five that 's about all I 'm being offered . " She smiled at me . I wanted this to be over as soon as possible . I knew I was supposed to say something pertinent . I had just had an offer , an offer which embarrassed me . I had come out of courtesy and obligation to try to let her know that things were different now . I had hoped that she would have sensed by my small signals that things were different . Insteadshe had just suggested a long-time love affair . One afternoon in her bed she had said , " You do n't need to apologize . You do n't need to apologize at all . " And she had laughed . I had never thought of myself asp101much of a lover , and when I had come too fast for her one time , I had mumbled something , and she had said , " At the risk of turning your head , you have nothing to apologize for at all . You 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " You 're very thoughtful . Shall I go on , or have I reassured you enough ? " And she had smiled . Her compliments had aroused me again . I had been surprised that I had been up to her needs and demands . There was a certain grossness about her which excited me . Later that same afternoon she had looked at me a long time and said , " I 'm going to break all the rules of our relationship , but I 'll go crazy if I do n't . " And after looking at me again for a long time , with a kind of fear , she had said , " I love you . I God-damn-it love you . " She had hugged me , and I had turned cold . " Do n't answer ! Do n't say anything ! Forget it ! " And I had managed to smile at her and kiss her and stroke her face lovingly . Now her offer of a love affair had been left hanging . I did n't answer it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some discussions on love affairs and marriages . " After a while there 's nothing ongoing about a love affair , and I 've found that any relationship requires something ongoing . " I talked about marriage , and inevitably to some extentabout Fran and me . " Yes , I read all that in your little book . But as I said , your relationship was unusual . . . almost unbelievable . " She knew I was rejecting her , and in retaliation she attackedmarriage more and more , and I defended it . Then we made the transition to talking about our writing , and I talked to her about her use of her feelings about sex and love and marriage in her writing . And she attacked my feelings about love and marriage not as they actually were , but as they appeared in my work . She knew I wrote close enough to the center of my feelings so that she could attackme by attacking the attitudes of my characters . " I always feel I would like to dirty your men up a lit/tle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make any sense to you ? " " Yes , it makes some sense . " I wanted to say to her that I would like to give some of her brutalized characters some feeling of sentiment and affection . But I did n't . It was she who wanted to hurt me for not accepting her offer . I just wanted to retreat with the best terms possible . And I had sometimes felt some kind of hypocrisy in me and my male characters . I had come to Sarah from a sick wife . A special privileged category . But had I come so innocently ? Had n't Fran 's illness been something of a selfrighteousexcuse for something I had wanted to do ? " Why do n't you put one of your men in bed with someone like me and have him do the things we did together . He 'd still be a nice man . At least I think so . " After dinner it was only nine-thirty . I did n't want to talk any more . I could n't just deposit her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't feel like one . But it would keep us quiet for a couple of hours and pass the necessary time . After the movie we walked back to her apartment , and at one crossing I took her arm to help her , and she respondedby pressing my hand to her side and up to the edge of her breast , with her elbow . I kept my hand there . It would not be much longer . " What are your plans ? " " I 'm going back to the country . There 's a great deal still to be done . Then I thought I might just go away someplace . I know you think it 's not healthy , but right now I have so much to straighten out inside my own head that I find straightening out my other relationships almost impossible . " I had unexpectedly added the last part . It had just seemed to follow , and she accepted it as an explanationof my attitude towards her that evening . " I understand . " She pressed my hand.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran 's old college around commencement time to hand out a prize and scholarship I 've set up there in her memory . And then I should go to the cottage at the beach . " " You have a lot to do . " " I seem to want to clear this all up , wind it up , and then get away . Disappear . " That word " disappear " had kept cropping up when people asked me my plans . I wanted to leave her at her doorstep , but that would be too much . As she opened the door , she said , " Come up for a nightcap ? " I looked at her and smiled . " Not tonight . I really am very tired . " I hoped she would not press further . " I understand . Well , anyway , come up for your pipe . Oh , no . You took that , did n't you ? Took all your belongings . " She smiled . " I 'll go upstairs with you . " As we climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a card from wherever you disappear to . " " I will . " " And you have my number . " " Yes . " " I 'll see you when you come to the office . " " Yes , of course . " " Though I 'm thinking of switching jobs , get something that will give me more time to write . Do n't tell anyoneyet . " " I wo n't . " She opened the door and looked at me , a wondering , longing , sad look . I suddenly felt great compassion for her . How many times had she been left like this ? And I wondered , " What if right now , standing there , she had put her arms around my neck and said I 'm so God-damned desperatelymiserable and lonely . Please come in and stay with me and sleep with me . ' " What would I have done ,  |p104and  what would I have felt ? I would have done it , of course . And I would have enjoyed it if that 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night . " " Good night . " I leaned down and kissed her . She looked at me and smiled , no longer trying . " What you 're in for the next few years ! Promise we can get together sometime , in the distant future , and you 'll tell me all about it . " I smiled . " Yes , sure . We 'll compare notes . " Now that she was not pressing , I felt tender towards her . This had been a terrible evening , but there had been warm and good ones , and we should part on that note . I embraced her , held her close , not kissing her . " Thanks , Sarah . I 've got such fouled-up , confused feelings about everything now , guilt and sadness and loneliness , and I do n't know what . But you know . . . back then . . . in a way you saved my life . " She held me tight for a few moments , then she kissed my cheek . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a wonderful time . " There were tears in her eyes . " Good night . " She moved inside the apartment and half closed the door . " Keep me in your telephone book . " And she smiled and closed the door.  |p105On  a fine day in mid-June , I drove up to Fran 's college just outside Boston to make the award which I had set up in her memory . It was too soon , really , for this kind of pilgrimage , but I wanted to go . If the award was in memory of Fran , I wanted the winner to know something of who and what Fran was . To this end , I had been working on a collection of pieces about her , pictures and articlesand a few of her letters . I intended to have them kept at the college so that each girl through the years could glance at them after she had won the prize . I pulled up at the Inn , took out my two suitcases , one filled with letters about Fran which I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just throw them away.  |p106Those  people do n't expect an answer . " But I needed them . This Inn had many memories for me . As I checked in , I heard the jukebox from the dimly lit bar where after rehearsalsof college plays Fran and I had shared our dreams and ambitions and confessed our sins . I had come out from Cambridge often to act small parts , and sometimes she had come to Cambridge to act in our plays . As I signed the register , I remembered that I had a key back home to Room i6 . We had had a habit of keepingthe keys to hotel rooms where we had enjoyed ourselvesthrough the years . I forget how Fran finally managed to sneak up to Room i6 the night she opened in Saint Joan . It had been an exhilarating night . She had been terribly effective and she was " high " with the excitement . I was staying at the Inn over the weekend ( I saw all the performances ) and after we had escaped from the cast party and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " I 'm coming up to your room . " As I say , I 'd forgotten how she managed it . It had something to do with the ladies ' room being on the second floor . I smiled . Fran always found a way to do everything she really wanted to do . We did n't make love that night . She would not let me in her , and did not until we were married . Oh , over the months I begged and pleaded and cajoled and pretended that I was going to force myself on her , but she did n't want that and she was very positive about it . We had a marvelous time anyway , lush with sensuality and discovery and humor and just feeling loved and in love . We experimentedendlessly and found all kinds of ways of exciting and satisfying each other . She introduced me to a way she had said was " very European , " but she would never tell me where she had learned it . Though she did tell me that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older boy . And he had left her . And I told her about a girl and a marriedp107woman who had " indoctrinated " me . " She did a very good job . " And she laughed . Fortunately they did not give me Room i6 or any other room we had occupied on our many returns to college . As I climbed the stairs with my suitcases , I nodded to parents who had come to see their daughters graduate . The daughters all looked so young . It was impossible to believe that Fran and I had been this young . I turned a corner in the corridor and surprised a boy and girl kissing . I smiled and said , " Sorry . " And they laughed easily , and suddenly I was miserably lonely for Fran and for our youth , which had been our best time.  |p108Those  of us on the stage stood as the girls marched in for Prize Night . There was no uniformity of dress . This was not Graduation . It was the more informal occasion of giving class poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls sat down , the lights in the auditorium lowered , and the program began . We looked at the girls , and the girls looked at us , faculty and guests . A phrase of my mother 's came to mind . " The pricelessgift of youth . " I had never really known what she was talking about when I was young . It had n't seemed a gift at all but a burden until I met Fran . I had longed to be older and mature and poised and self-assured . But now in myp109early forties , I knew what she had meant . Even those girls who were not really pretty were beautiful with youth . I looked along the rows , and I thought how nature repeatsherself ! I could almost name each girl for her counterpartin Fran 's class . I felt like smiling at them in recognition . Pat , the studious one . Myra , the poet . Mimi , the seductress . Rachel , very much involved with settlement houses , with really no time left for frivolous things like combing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did look like Fran . She had what always had been described as Fran 's " heart-shaped face . " I wondered if she could be the one who had won the drama prize . It was uncanny . I kept looking back at her . I thought , " I never should have risked coming here . It 's too soon . But perhaps if I just read the words I had written I can get away with it . " One of my friends had laughed and said , " I 'm beginning to be attracted by my daughter 's girl friends , and that 's bad . " How easy it was to be attracted by them ! I felt as young as they looked , actually younger than I had felt at their age when I had been a kind of hypochondriac . . . until I met Fran . Then all symptoms had disappeared . I remembered that one outspoken friend had remarked on it . " You know , you used to more or less fade into the woodwork . What the hell 's happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wandering , snooping , attendingcountless movies alone , but a girl on the other end of the phone , work done quickly so that I could get to her , evenings not dreaded for their emptiness but anticipated for their possibilities . I had had the feeling of being suddenlyliberated from the prison of my inhibitions . Everythingwas possible . My eyes looked further back in the hall , and there were the young men . Their young men . Was I ever that young ? Not alone , but together with Fran I was that young . In a sense , she had given me my youth . I looked for myself in the rows of young men , but I could find no one.  |p110Oh  , I would have liked to have identified with that tall ruddy-faced young man with all that lustrous hair , but honesty would n't permit it . I still had a mop of unruly brown hair , but that was about it . Now the heart-shaped-face girl was coming down the aisle to receive a prize in higher mathematics . Fran could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like Fran 's . She would run to fat later on . Fran could still wear the clothes she wore on her honeymoon . The ribs were the test . You should always be able to see your ribs , was her contention . And no bra . If you wear a bra , the muscles get lazy . Of course , after the operation . . . Finally . . . " This evening we have a new award which we have n't had on Prize Nights before . It is in Drama "  --  I sat up and reached in my pocket for my notes  --  " for the most promising actress in the graduating class . And we 're honored tonight to have with us the donor of the award , the novelist , Christopher Larsen , who will presentthe award , and , I hope , say a few words about the woman it honors , Frances Larsen . " I started from my chair to approach the lectern , when she went on . " I think it might not be inappropriate to announceat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our new theatre , which you all have seen under construction across the campus , will be named The Frances Larsen Theatre . " There was a burst of applause at this announcement , and I was left moving to the lectern with a lump in my throat . It was unfair to throw this at me when I had everythingunder control . I started to read what I had written , trying to think of anything but what I had just heard and what I was saying . " Thank you , President Brewer . I just wanted to tell you , perhaps , the Why ' of this award . It is a frankly sentimentalaward . As many of you know , Fran came to collegep111here , studied acting here , and played in many plays under the direction of your beloved Miss Allison . " I turned and bowed towards a spare little lady who had given Fran most of her fierce standards , who had always been proud of her , and who had always kept in touch . The audience applauded , and she waved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fran went on to be an apprentice the summer she graduated , at the Chapel Playhouse on Cape Cod . I was an apprentice , too , that summer . It was there that she blossomed into being a fully accomplished actress , and it was there that she persuaded me to give up acting and become a writer . " The laughter made it easier . " Fran always believed that the only way to learn to act was to act . So this award is appropriate . A full scholarship with room and board at the Chapel Playhouse this summer and a small amount to help pay for a cold-water flat in New York or someplace else next fall . " I looked at the slip of paper which Mrs. Brewer had given me as I approached the lectern . " The winner this year is Marianne Chappelle . " I looked out into the semi-darkened auditorium to see which one would be Marianne Chappelle . Somehow I had not seen her as my eyes had wandered over the rows , or I would have known . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tall and slender and held herself beautifully , almost like a dancer . Her dark hair was worn in her own particular style , not the style of the day . And as I moved to the edge of the stage to help her up the stairs , I saw her large dark eyes , and they were filled with tears . She smiled at me as she took my hand to be helped . The entire effect of her was striking . I led her to the lectern , handed her the envelope and stepped aside . She smiled desperately and looked at a small piece of paper she had crumpled in her hand . " Thank you . " And I knew she was never going to make it . Tears started comingp112to my eyes as I tried to smile encouragement . " I . . . I ca n't tell you what this means . . . what this . . . " She bit her lip , turned to look at me helplessly , and then walked rapidly off the stage into the wings and disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully . The sympathetic audience burst into understanding laughter and applause to cover her confused exit . I returned to my seat . When the ceremonies were over , Miss Allison made her way to me and put her arm around me and kissed my cheek , and said gruffly , " Thanks for the nice words . You did n't have to . " " I wanted to . Fran always said you were the most importantinfluence in her acting life . " " Fran always was too generous with her praise , but that was Fran . " She kept her arm around my waist as we walked to the side of the stage . " Look , this is all rough for you , I know . But it means a lot to us all . Thanks . " " I wanted to come . " " Because Fran would have done it , I know . But it must be one hell of a strain . That girl has great promise . Sorry she muffed it up there , but ever since she 's known she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could make summer plans  --  she 's become very involved with Fran and her life , and she identifies with everything that 's happened to you and Fran , and . . . well , I guess it was just too much for her . " " That 's very touching . " " Well , she 's read all the things you sent up , and the things you 've written about Fran , and of course we already had a raft of material on her . " " She 's very striking . Fantastic features for the theatre . " No one part of her face is beautiful except those eyes , but it all adds up to an impression of beauty . I think she 's going to be great . " We were leaving the building . " You look as though you could stand a drink , or several.  |p113Some  of the members of the department and a few of the better students are coming to my house for whatever they can find . Would that be too rough on you ? Just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a difficult one to visit . Fran and I had met there when I had come from Cambridgeto try out for a play ( to meet girls , really ) . And we had often rehearsed in her large oak-beamed living room , and matchmaker that she was , Miss A had managed to leave us alone in the house a number of times , had turned it over to us to cook meals for ourselves . We had lain entwinedfor hours and hours on the couch in front of the fireplace . . . She looked up at me . " No ? All right . Some people want to run away , never go back . Some do n't want to run away . We started across the quadrangle in the direction of her house . Fran had really been deeply influenced by this no-nonsense yet terribly considerate little woman , who had spent most of her life living other people 's lives . " I seem not to want to run away , at least yet . I 'm staying in the house . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nothing but her . Maybe it 's a way of holding on awhile longer . " She put her arm around my waist again and studied the path as we walked . " I 'm going to say something very tactless , so forgive me . But I do n't know when I 'm going to see you again , so I ca n't be too nice about my choice of time . But I hope that you find some nice woman and marry again . " She must have felt me tighten . She looked up at me . " I said it was the wrong time , but remember it six or eight months from now . You adored Fran , and that was good . And you will go on adoring her . And that will also be good . I 've been reading what you 've written about her . And it 's lovely and true . But you 've given her credit forp114everything you ever did , inspiration , et cetera , which is touching and understandable at this moment . But it simplyis not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life out of tending a legend . Now I 'll shut up , and let 's go get drunk . "  |p115A  dozen or more of Miss A 's " kids " were already in the house when we arrived . Those who had been at Prize Night had changed into jeans and sweaters . They were in full charge of the party . Miss A sang out , " Look , everybody . This is Chris Larsen . You all know who he is . If you want him to know whoyou are , take care of introducing yourselves . But not until he 's had a drink . " And she led the way into the kitchen . I smiled and said " Hello " to the students we passed . They smiled back . I knew the ropes of this kind of eveningfrom talks I had given at other colleges . When I had mydrink , it would be up to me to break the ice . Probablynone of them had read anything I had written . Tonight Ip116was strictly Fran 's husband , and I would do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , parrying questionsabout myself , find out the special interests of each and encourage her or him in that interest . We entered the kitchen , where Fran had taught me the basics of cooking . A few girls were getting things ready . " Christopher Larsen . . . Debby Thompson , Bonnie Rogers ( a very funny comedian ) and Helen Margolis , my righthandeverything . . . Where 's the booze ? " I tried to talk to the " funny comedian " and ask her what she had played , but she was shy . " Oh , Miss A exaggerates . I had this funny part in the last show . So I was funny . " " It was a nothing of a part , and you were funny . So , you 're funny , " Miss A shot at her . " However , she 's off to get married , so that 's that . I hope your husband likes a funny girl . I imagine it would be a great asset in marriage . " She took me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her study-library . " I 've got a gift for you . We entered the study . Books , pictures , model sets , costume sketches , a jumble of theatre objects . " That 's a model of the theatre . Fran 's theatre . That took you by surprise , did n't it ? I was mad as hell about holding the announcementtill tonight . I told them about Fran , how sick she was , but they would n't . I wish she could have known . " I stood and looked at the model of the theatre and frowned . I had found this a way to block emotion . The next moment I had a headache , and took a drink . " It looks great . " " It 's not what it should be , but then , like most small college theatres , it has to double as lecture hall , concert hall and movie theatre . We 're just lucky it does n't also have to serve as a gymnasium and annex to the infirmary . " She went to her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open this now . And do n't open it ever if youp117do n't want to . But I 've gathered together the pictures of Fran when she was acting here . And the ones of you too . You looked very good in tights . I 'm sorry you were n't inclinedtowards older women . " She smiled and handed me the envelope . " Now I 'm going to see if Marianne has arrivedyet and send her in to you so that she can thank you properly . " " Look , please . She does n't have to . . " Just stay here , " and she left . I had just about decided to risk opening the manila envelope when Marianne Chappelle was standing in the doorway with a drink for me . " Miss A said I was to bring you this . " She had changed into blue jeans and a faded scarlet turtleneck sweater , and her dark hair was down around her shoulders . " Thank you . " I took the glass and put the empty one on a table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for my incredible clumsiness at the ceremony . " " Oh , that was charming . " " I had something all written out , but then . . " I understand . Congratulations again . " " It was bumbling , and I ca n't stand bumblers . I wanted to say something about your wife . I 'd done so much reading about her and you , and it was my responsibility to say something about her . " " I 'm very touched that you wanted to . " Her large dark eyes looked at me with such challengingintensity that it was difficult to return her look . There was an air of concern , as though she were saying , " How are you , really ? " It was all I could do not to reach out and touch this girl . " What parts have you played here ? " " Oh , the inevitable for someone of my height . Rosalindin As You Like It , Joan in Saint Joan . " " Fran played Joan . "  | " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept thinking that in the back of her mind she was saying , Why ca n't you do it the way Fran Larsen did it ? ' " Again the lovely smile . I had forgotten about beautiful girls . " I 'm sorry I did n't see you . " " I 've read all the pieces you 've written on Fran . I'msorry , but that 's what we call her here , since she 's more orless the patron saint of the Drama Department . " " That 's nice . That 's fine . " " I 'd like to know more . You know , with the poetry prize , it 's the obligation of the winner to write a paper on the poet in whose memory it 's given . " " That seems a rather arduous task . . . But I 'm getting together some material , a kind of scrapbook . " " I 'd like to see it . " " And I have some tapes . " She never took her eyes off me . It was as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be down at the beach cottage this sum-mer ? " I looked at her for a moment . " I do n't know . That 's going to be the hardest place to go . " " I can imagine . I feel I know it all by heart . " " How ? " " From what you 've written about it . " " It 's just the way we left it in a hurry last year . The beds are probably still unmade . We never had anybody help down there . No intrusions . " " I 'll be down there at the theatre . If you do n't want to go , I could take care of things . Send you anything you might want . I should do something for my scholarship . " She smiled , and her eyes talked and questioned and seemed to plead . I had never seen such expressive eyes . " Thanks , but no . I want to do it myself . " " I understand . " " I may not get there till fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of tears in her eyes , though she was smiling at me , and again I wanted to reach out and hold her . Tears and this lovely girl . I had the most terrible body hunger , an almost uncontrollable desire to hold her . The loving and inconsolable husband of Fran Larsen , keeper of the flame , survivor of the beautiful marriage , had no other desire than to hold this lovely girl who looked at him as though she wanted him to tell her everything . I cherished the concern in this girl 's eyes . I wanted to tell her that I was exhausted , burned out . I wanted to tell her how much I had loved my wife and how much I needed to make love to her . " Here is what I was going to say tonight . " She handed me a crumpled piece of paper . " It 's not the same as saying it , but at least you 'll know I meant to say it . " " Thanks . " I started to open it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll feel silly . " She put her hand on mine to stop me . " Well , has she made amends ? " Miss A had returned . Marianne quickly withdrew her hand . " I 've just given him what I meant to say . " " If you get to the Cape this summer , drop in and look at her . She 's good . And this one is n't going to get married . " This embarrassed Marianne . I remembered that Fran had said she was never going to get married  --  then one day she married me . " Incredible dedication . The purestgirl I ever met . " And she pointed a finger at Marianne . " I do n't mean her love life . I do n't know anything about that . Ha-ha . But I mean purity where it counts . " Completelyflustered , Marianne blushed and looked at me , wondering what I would think . " I leave you nothing to say . Good . Then get out and mingle with your peers . Your puppy dog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shoulder and kissed her on the cheek . She turned to me . " I used to call you Fran 's puppy dog , re-member ? "  |p120As  Marianne retreated , she said to me , " I 'm going to write you a proper letter . " " When she learns how to spell . " Miss A shooed her from the room . As she went into the hall , I saw a young man 's arm go around her waist . " Fran would have been proud of that girl . She shames me with her dedication , her discipline . Did you see the way she holds herself ? Fantastic . Such style . Absolutely ruthless with herself . It 'll take her weeks to get over not having said her little speech tonight . " She sat down on the couch and patted the place beside her . " Now , let 's talk . "  |p121After  two weeks at home in Connecticut , I headed for our beach cottage on the Cape . One more " duty call " to make before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not just to disappear geographically but perhaps to disappear as Chris Larsen , his attitudes , his history , his strengths and weaknesses . During the two weeks there had been constant invitations to dinner , picnics , movies , cookouts . Some I had accepted , and some I had not accepted , thereby offending and losing friends . Others had simply dropped in . " We were passing and saw the lights . " So that finally if I wanted to be alone , I closed the garage door and sat in the kitchen in the dusk without turning on a light.  |p122I  had found myself staying in bed longer , withdrawing from the empty days . There had been times in my life when I had managed to doze away whole days and weeks rather than face the anxiety of emptiness . The letters gave me something to do , and I welcomed them . I was a writer and I should write . I would have to start earning a living soon . But I could think of nothing but Fran , of the last years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about them . I had often envied men who had to get up and go to an office and busy themselves with business routines . I enviedthem more now . Their business obligations seemed to me to provide them with at least a framework for their otherwise possibly shaky lives . I ran over assignments which had been offered me . I must check with my agent . Get out of here . Get an assignment in a foreign country , if possible , where nobody would know me . I would go to the Cape to set all that in order , and then . . . I stopped to shop in a town ten miles from our beach cottage , in a place where I was not known . I then approachedour entrance by a back road , avoiding our village and the houses of friends . I had dreaded this visit , yet knew it had to be made , almost longed to make it , longed to keep finding the pain , thus keep contact with Fran . During the years of illness I had ticked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult after her death . And this place was always the hardest . It would be the place most dominated by her absence . At the entrance to our drive , I stopped and swung open the gate , started to look in the mailbox , then decided against it . All second- and third-class mail stuffed into the box . If I removed it , Bessie , the mail carrier , would know I was there , and the news would be around town in an hour . I drove the car through the gate , got out and closed it , andp123started down the twisting avenue of pines that led to the clearing and the cottage and the water beyond . This cottage had been our first real home . We had bought it with the first money we had saved and with the help of my father . At first Fran had not liked it because it was run-down and ramshackle , but her best friend had talked to her and told her how essential it was for me to have a place away from our lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford at the time . The morning after the first night we spent in it , we had had a fight . She had said " Call the real-estate agent and tell her to sell it . " I forgot what it was , the smell from the kerosene hot-water heater . I do n't know . But I had insistedthat we keep it , and as she fixed it up , she had come to love it . I knew we needed someplace of our own , away from our small five-flight walk-up in the city , with its incessant going and coming of Fran 's friends and students , someplacewhere we could be alone . And it had been just that for us . Over the years it was a place to which we had brought our jangled nerves , our differences , our murderouslyconflicting schedules , and on the beach , in the water , in the simplicity of the house we had been able usually to touch base again . We had been lovers in this village when we had been apprentices at the summer theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to this cottage . Even after we had basically moved to the country and only kept a small apartment in the city , this was still our place to get away to . We would instinctively sense that it was time for us to get to the cottage , recharge our batteries while driving through the winding roads . ( She alwaysloved to " tour "  --  " Look , Chris , there 's a road we have n't taken ! " ) I could never explain why , but at the cottage we al/ways seemed to be so much better suited sexually . In the city , days and weeks would go by , anxieties over work , hers and mine , would build up , time schedules would make any kind of moving together impossible . We would meet each other coming and going . Yet we were so ambitious for each other , so proud of each other , that we would try not to notice the loneliness of our marriage . Then sometimes we would grab at each other , knowing that it had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in our make-up we wanted it . And often it had not been at all satisfactory . Frantic , distracted , a " thing " we did together with an unspoken promiseof a more relaxed and real and meaningful coming together at some later time . Keeping the franchise . Resentments would grow , inevitably . Bad timing , poorly concealed accommodations to each other , transparentexcuses . Yet when we got in the car and drove towards the cottage , it was as though we could sense that things would be different up here . We had the memory of intensetimes of love-making , days naked on the beach , the sensuousness of salt water and sun . Up here we seemed to be able to cope with the simple problems of the cottage and the more complex problems of ourselves . It was , in a sense , playing house . And perhaps we were both better at that than at keeping house . I drove out of the woods and there the cottage lay , down by the water . The grass had not been cut . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year . " You want me to cut the grass again this year ? " I stopped the car and just sat there . The wall had not been finished . Last fall , when we had left here so suddenly , Frank had promised it would be fixed by spring . It was force of habit to check the chores we had left to be done . When we had driven up from the city on Friday nights , arrivingafter dark , before we would go into the house , we would explore the grounds with flashlights or use the lightsp125of the car to see what work had been done in our absence , to see if the roses had started to bloom , if the shelves had been put up in the shed . Each nail driven , each plant planted , each stone laid on a wall made it more ours . And sometimes in the summer we would take off our clothes and run into the water and then hurry shivering back into the cottage to start a fire . " Why ca n't it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like spoiling it by saying , " It could be , if only . . . " But I did n't say it . It all seemed so petty in the light of our joy at that moment . And she did n't say whatever it was she might have said . We asked questions . We never faced the answers . I got out of the car , leaving the door open , and walked through the high grass and around to the front of the house and the wooden deck facing the beach . Fran 's " birthday roses " were in bloom . Roses which came out almostwithout fail within a day or two of her birthday . Frank had apparently cultivated around the bushes . And he had cut a small stretch of lawn by the side of the house . Why had he stopped ? The late-afternoon sun felt warm and good . I do n't think I could have stood it if Fran had died in the winter . An odd thought , but one that had occurred to me several times . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the back door , took the key from under the rock . Ants were crawling all over it . I opened the door and stepped in . The house was dark and chilly and smelled of dead mice . I went to the kitchen cupboard and took a couple of swigs from the bottle of bourbon , opened a window , turned up the thermostat to kill the dampness , and went outside again . I walked around the outside of the house , peering in the windows like some trespasser . A ground hog scampered from his home beneath the shed across the lawn and into the field beyond . Fran had hated ground hogs and always wanted me to shoot them . I had tried once , but had onlyp126wounded it and had n't been able to find it to put it out of its misery . I never shot another . I sat on the railing at the edge of the deck and looked out at the long stretch of empty beach and the water . My head was aching . I needed another drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was warmer . Although it was summer now , I had felt cold ever since Fran 's death . I could have asked Frank to come in and turn up the heat for my arrival , but then people would have known I was here . What did I hope to accomplish here ? Some final burning-out of the wound ? One last and terrible encounter with the pain ? And then it would be over ? Cold turkey ? Or some compulsion to stay close to Fran , secure and hurting . I went around to the car , took out the provisions , entered the house and closed the door . The kitchen was a mess . I had kept it more or less clean that last month we had been up here , but the last day we had left in such a hurry . " I 've got to get to the hospital , Chris . The pains are very bad . " Then the long and painful ride into the city for the final operation . I opened the refrigerator to put away the things I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . How much she had eaten then , and still skin and bones . Breakfast and then a midmorning something , lunch , tea , and then dinner and a nighttime snack while I read to her . I hardly seemed to get out of the kitchen before she would giggle apologetically and say she was hungry again . I dumped everything into the garbage can , took the bourbon and moved into the living room , which Fran had made so bright and cheerful . It was still a little damp and I started a fire and then sat back on the large country couch . " Well , Fran , here I am . Here we are . " Fran 's presence had always been with me . Other girls I had known disappeared from my thoughts when theyp127were absent . There was no " idea " connected with them . Lively , beautiful , desirable , interesting . Fran was always more than that , an idea , a set of values and aspirations . A soul . It was not important that she be there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , often more " there " when not actually present , diminished slightly by dailiness . Now dead , therefore , more " there " than ever . A friend who was trying to comfort me had told me that his wife had been dead ten years and he could hardly remember her face . I could n't believe it . Or perhaps it was Fran 's being an invalid , in my charge for those years , my child , in effect , as well as my wife that put some kind of indeliblestamp on her image , on our relationship . I looked unseeing into the flame . " You never looked back , Fran . When we kissed good-bye on street corners or at airports or stations , you always turned away and walked on without looking back . I always stood there for a while , or kept turning to see if you were turning . " " Let go , Chris . Let me go . " I was so much more dependent on you than you were on me . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependencyin that way , physical , taking care of . I was dependent on you for the quality of my life . The endless hours I hung around rehearsal halls , or the stopping by to take you to lunch or dinner between rehearsals or your classes . I seemed to have no life independent of you . It was my work and you . But that had been my understanding of what marriage was . Or simply my need . I would like to have one person I could talk to , talk and talk . Try to go through everything , sort it all out . But there is nobody but you . And after a while we did n't talk much about what mattered . How often there were things I wanted to say to you , but I waited till you were away or I was away , and then I wrote them to you . And we never mentioned the letters when we were together again . So open in my letters . My letters from the Pacific , not aboutp128the death and destruction around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I get back , let 's just be alone for a while and try . " But you were always more formal , barely humoring the ardent man in the letters , perhaps not trusting him in real life . Your letters full of what you were doing and " I miss you . " My letters full of tortured emotions and longingexpressed in sexual terms which embarrassed you , though I explained that officers censored each other 's letterswithout reading them . I looked around the room . This room had been our world for two months last summer . Taking care of you , washing you , cooking , massaging . I refused all offers of help from women of the village with nursing experience . For so much of our lives we had been unavailable to each other , it was as though I wanted to make up for it all in the time we had left . Voices and images and memories began to drift back . " I 'm not going to get better gradually . One day I 'm just going to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll be well . " When all hope has gone , there has to be something . " You must not tell her unless she demands to be told . It is not something you force on a patient just because it is your theory she should know . If she wants to know , have her make an appointment with me . I have had more experience in telling patients these things . As her doctor it is my responsibility to tell her . " The night here in the cottage when she had asked for the truth , perhaps the third or fourth time ( Oh , Jesus , that night ! ) , and finally she had calmed down and had eaten her supper and taken a Demerol . I had washed the dishes and gathered things together for my trip to the village dump . She was stirring as I passed through the living room . " I 'm just going to the dump . You all right ? " She had nodded . " I 'll be back and read to you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p129I  put the garbage can in the station wagon and drove off into the twilight to the dump . It had been raining for two days , and I had n't been able to get out , and now I was out and away from the questions I could not answer . After stopping at the dump , I suddenly found myself taking the turn away from the beach , away from the cottage , and soon I was driving with almost suicidal recklessness through the twisting country roads , exhilarated by the risks I was taking , unable to stop . I drove on and on , inviting Fate at every curve . Finally it was dark , and I was calmer , and I turned back towards the cottage . As I emerged from the woods into the . clearing , I saw no lights . Fran would be asleep where I had left her . I stopped the car , got out and took the garbage can into the kitchen . Then I heard weeping . I went into the living room and turned on the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I turned to the deck , and there she was on her hands and knees in the dark , sobbing . " What 's the matter ? " " Where were you ? " " I was at the dump . " " But you were gone so long . You 've never been gone that long . " " I just drove for a while . What are you doing out here ? " " I was frightened . " " Of what ? " " I do n't know . I just did n't know where you were . " I was angry , and hated myself for being angry . I had just wanted to drive , had had to drive for an hour , and she had punished me by doing this . Not punished , for Christ 's sake . She was helpless , frightened . As I helped her into the wheelchair and back inside the house , I murmured over and over , " I 'm sorry . I'mp130sorry . I just wanted to drive . It was so beautiful . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , and after a while I read to her till she felt tired enough to go to bed . Every cruel , unkind , short word came back to me . " Chris , maybe it would be better if you put me back in the hospital . " One morning when she wanted breakfast before I was really awake . " No . No . Just give me a minute to get awake . " People wondered at the care I took of her . I wondered at their wonder . She was going to know that she was loved . Let that be her last knowledge in this world . Why had I been so anxious to have her know this ? This internal dialogue had gone on ever since Fran had died . I had total and instant recall of every moment of cruelty . I got up and shuffled towards the bedroom . The bed was still unmade . Last fall I had hastily thrown a cover over it . A pair of her shoes tossed in a corner . As we were leaving hurriedly , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have to take my shoes . " Sharply . " We ca n't take them all . I want to get you to the hospital as soon as possible . " In tears . " I want to take my shoes . " In anger I had gathered together the ten pairs of shoes we had carried back and forth from the city , though I knew she would never wear any of them again , would never walk again . Of course I understood their meaning for her , for God 's sake . I was n't stupid . But I was tired and beyond my limit . She had said we could leave this pair of shoes because she wore them only at the cottage , and I had tossed them angrily towards the closet . Ashamed and guilty , guilty of everything that was wrong with our marriage , even guilty of her death , I leaned against the doorway to the bedroom and started to cry . I cried for I do n't know how many hours until I finally fell asleep.  |p131Sometime  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt drained . I did n't really allow myself to come fully awake . I was vaguely aware that I needed to go to the bathroom , but it could wait . The sun was up . I could see it on the beach and water . I did n't know what time it was . I did n't care . I woke up again sometime later . Half asleep , I got up and shuffled into the bathroom . I stumbled back to the bed . I felt like some very old people I had known , crumpledon their beds . " Go away ! " That 's all that they had been able to say , and they had meant it . They were not asking for pity , or for someone to insist on staying . Theyp132genuinely wanted to be alone . They did n't have the psychologicalenergy to make or endure social contact . I lay there on my side , staring into middle distance . I had reached the depths I wanted to reach . Surely there was no further to go . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that I was hungry . I had n't eaten last night . I had drunk a lot , and maybe I 'd wolfed some crackers , but I was hungry . I moved through the living room into the kitchen . I put some water in the coffee pot , took oranges from the refrigerator , and was about to squeeze them when I looked out the window towards the beach . Sitting on the railing at the edge of the deck was a girl . I just stood there and looked , resenting the intrusion . Were the kids from the village taking over this beach , knowing I was n't here this summer ? I looked up and down the beach . Deserted . She turned and looked in the direction of the house , and I saw that it was Marianne . Were the apprentices at the theatre using the beach ? Sometimes Fran and I had invitedthem down for a beach party after a performance or for an occasional afternoon swim . Perhaps it was just Mariannewho was using it , and maybe the boyfriend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at Miss A 's . I felt annoyance at the intrusion , but at the same time I was once more aware of what a lovely girl she was . Black hair , white T-shirt , faded blue jeans , bright orange towel on the rail beside her . I did n't want to be rude . She had been so very touching after the award ceremonies , but I did n't think I could stand watching her and her boyfriend running down to the water , clowning , and finally lying out in the sun on that orange towel . She must have seen my car . Why did n't she knock ? Not knowing what I was going to say , I opened the door onto the deck and stepped out . She heard the doorp133opening and jumped off the railing and came towards me . " Hello . " " Hello . " " If you want to be alone , just tell me to go away . I 've been coming down here afternoons to swim and sun . Today we have the whole day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have gone away when I saw the car . " She was looking at me again with that concerned look . " No . No . I 'm glad you 've been using the place . " " How are you ? " That small frown . " I 'm okay . " I obviously did n't look it . " It 's a beautiful place . " " Yes . " " How do you like the job I did on your lawn ? " " Did you do it ? " " Yes , but this is all I managed before- I broke the mower . . . And I dug around the roses . " " Thanks . Usually a man does this . I guess he thought I would n't be coming down this summer . . . You looked as though you were waiting for someone . " " Me ? No . I just come alone . " She flashed her radiant smile at me . " I would have cleaned up the house for you , but I could n't get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the people who had done that . . . before . " " The key is kept under the flat stone near the back door . " " When did you arrive ? " " Late yesterday afternoon . " " I did n't get here yesterday . May I see the house , or would you rather I did n't ? " " It 's a mess . " " I peeked in the windows . It looks lovely . So bright and comfortable . " " I was getting myself some breakfast . "  | " I wish I 'd known when you were coming . I would have laid in some things . " We moved towards the door . " I stopped at the marketon the way . " " It 's a sweet village . " " I shopped up the coast . I did n't want anyone to know I was here . " Just inside the door she stopped and looked at me seriously . " Then I should n't be here . " " No . I 'm glad you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She paused before the production photographs of the plays Fran had done , studying them carefully . " I saw that one . It 's the first play I ever saw . " " It 's all a mess . We left very suddenly . Fran woke up one morning and wanted to get to a hospital . " " If you 'd let me , I 'd like to help set it straight . Onlywhat you told me to do . " She had the gentlest voice . " It 's not required for your award , you know . " She smiled . " I know , but if you 'd let me . " " I do n't know how long I 'm going to stay . " She looked around quickly with a frown . " Oh ? " " I 'm not so sure it was such a good idea coming down . " " You look very tired . " " Well , I need a shave and I fell asleep in these clothes . . . " We moved back towards the bedrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bed was still unmade , the shoes on the floor . We moved into the other room , where I had spent the night . " This is the guest room , or really , my study . We did n't have many guests down here . It was the place we came to be alone . " She looked over at the almost empty bottle of bourbon on the night table and moved to thep135windows . " Most of the rooms open onto the beach or ocean . Get up in the morning and run right out and take a dip , skinny . " " I 've been doing that . I mean , swimming skinny . There does n't seem to be anybody around . " She looked at me with that smile . And I just looked at her , and her smile died slowly and that frown took its place , her eyes never leaving mine . I reached out and touched her face , barely touched it , and shook my head . She moved her head slightly and kissed the palm of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms and crushed her to me . Her arms went around me and held me to her tightly , as if this had been something she had been wanting to do . With short , quick movements she kissed my head , my cheeks , my eyes . Her intensity took me by surprise . My body surged with desire . My hands stroked quickly up and down her hack , clutching and pressing her against me . It was all urgent for both of us . We said nothing , just small noises , murmurs . I felt her small breasts under the thin shirt . She moved away quickly and went to the bed and lay down with her arms open for me . I plunged into her arms and held her , and just rocked her . The feel of a live , vital body pressing into mine . It was a feast , but not the time to feast and savor , but to devour . My hand went under her shirt . With a quick motion she stripped it off and unsnappedher bra and offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my erection . I thought I would come before I got near her . I wanted just to lie by this body and hold it and touch it and experience it , but I also wanted to be in it , moving strongly and unafraid . I reached for the buttons on her jeans , but she was there before me , and the whole awkward business of removing clothes was over in a second . I reached down to fondle her , but she took my body and urged it on top of her . She was ready . She needed nop136more . With a cry that was half a groan I entered her . Her legs clasped around me . With her arms she clamped me to her . She would allow no control , no waiting , no technique . With a kind of purity she insisted , and gratefully I acceptedand selfishly drove on to my own release.  |p137When  I came , I did n't stop because I knew shehad not come yet . But after a minute or so she stoppedand put her hand on my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Just . . . No . " And she stopped my movements . I lay there , chagrined . She had seemed to want it thisway , had wanted no caresses , had simply wanted me to goahead . My feelings were confused , part enormous gratitude , and part resentment that she had almost forced meto use her like this . I had not always been successful withFran after our marriage . It had been so great before . Butafter , I had sometimes found myself coming long beforeshe was ready , and when I had tried to take a longer timebefore , with my hands or mouth , she had said , " No . . .  |p138No  . . . I want you in me . " And sometimes when she had n't come and I had tried to bring her around with my hands or mouth , she would say , " No . . . No . It was nice just having you in me . " I had never believed her . I came to hate that phrase . Now I reached down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped my hand and said , " No . No . . . Just stay close . " " I 'm sorry . " " Why ? " " It 's just . . . " Her eyes were still closed , smiling . " I wanted it that way . " It 's just so selfish . " " No . I 'll be selfish later on . Perhaps . If we feel like it . Just rest . " I reached down and pulled the sheet over us . I stroked her breast , but she said , " No . . . No . Not now . " I raised myself on one elbow and looked at her , smiling . She smiled back , a smile of satisfaction . I shook my head . " What ? " I kissed her lightly . " Do n't you want to rest ? " I lowered my head next to her . " What ? " she asked again . What ? Everything which one day I might tell her . How incredible it was to have everything all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and richer still for the sadness that lay behind it . I would have been incredibly happy just to lie beside her and hold her cool body for a long while , but she had been eager and so pure in her eagerness , that I should be with her completely . " Thank you . " " Oh , no , no . I wanted to come to the Inn back at collegeand be with you that night . " " I wanted to reach out and touch you at Miss A 's . " " Why did n't you ? " " It would have seemed . . . incongruous . We 'd beenp139talking about Fran and your feelings for her , and mine . . . " She raised herself on her elbow and looked down at me with great seriousness . " Does this , our being here like this , upset you ? I mean . . . " I smiled and frowned . " Becauseif it does , if this makes you feel in any way . . . I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feelings for Fran . " I reached up and pulled her down and kissed her . She snuggled in my neck . I kissed the top of her head . I knew that in some odd way she was here with me because of my marriage , or what she felt about my marriage . We lay there for a while , not saying anything . I was filled with the complexities of my feelings , the ironies . I was here because Fran was dead . Out of my deep sadness had come this great delight . Did Marianne , this child , feel anything for me , or was this just an act of mercy ? Did she feel she was some surrogate come to take care of me in my grief ? What grief ? I felt no grief at the moment . She began to stroke my chest . " Why do n't you take your shirt off ? You left your shirt on . " " I know . " " Do you always leave it on when you make love ? " " Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl I was embracing said , My , you 're thin . ' I think I 've always been self-conscious of that ever since . " " Let 's see how thin you are . " And she unbuttoned the last button and opened my shirt . " I do n't think you 're too thin . " And she kissed my nipple . " I 'm the one who should keep my top on with these little breasts . They 're ridiculous , are n't they ? " I reached over and cupped one . " They 're adorable . " I started to kiss them , excited again , to my surprise . I looked down at myself . " Later is now . " She ran her hands over me , and addressing my rising cock , said , " Thank you . " I started to caress her , leaning onp140one elbow , but she eased me down flat on my back and said , " I can only seem to manage if I 'm on top . Does that bother you ? " I was delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was touched and aroused even more by her openness . " Just lie back and I 'll do all the work . " She smiled . While she arranged herself , I again had the fear that I would be too fast for her . I would have no control now , since she would be regulating the pace and the movements . Fran and I had tried this way a couple of times when we were first married , but she had n't liked it . She leaned down and kissed me . " Are you shocked ? " " No , delighted . " I reached up and held her breasts , then ran my hand down her long arching back and stroked her bottom . I moved my hand to her clitoris . " No . I do n't need that . " And I went back to stroking her breasts . In a surprisinglyfew moments her pace quickened , her eyes closed , and driving herself upon me , she reached her climax and sank on my chest , her hips still moving sensuously against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was this ? It gave me an incredible feeling . After a few moments she looked down at me through her dark hair falling over her face and smiled . " It was n't good for you . " " Yes it was , " and I hugged her . " What a pair we are ! You do n't like it that way . " " I loved it . " " Come now ! " And she started to move her hips . " No . " I stopped her . " Save it for later . " She laughed and rolled away . We lay spoon-fashion , and in a few moments she was dozing . I had no desire to sleep now . I was too filled with paradoxand pleasure . And gratitude . Why had I always feltgratitude , as though the woman were doing me a favor ? With Sarah , I had felt gratitude but also shame . I hadp141had no desire to hold her damp , fleshy body after sex . I had simply wanted to get out , embarrassed that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her and fondled her and smiled at her through half-open eyes , as though it were all real , but I sensed the hypocrisy . Lying there with Marianne dozing in the angle of my neck , I could n't believe it . That was the overriding feeling . Wonder . And again , gratitude . And the exhilaration of feeling my own sexual power , in a sense , returned to me . The beautiful simplicity , uncomplicated by tension and resentments . I looked down at Marianne 's lithe , tan body nestled against my white body . I had never felt particularly comfortableundressed , not thinking much of my rather thin body . " Women are not as conscious of bodies as men are . " But I did n't believe it . Little-boy talk , little-boy thoughts . Obsessed with questions of virility . Yet I remembered the great judge who had confided in me in his last years when I had gone to sit with him in the afternoons that the one thing he would like would be to have an erection , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been spent in bed making love . My arm was going to sleep . My hand twitched a little holding her small breast . I had lied about her breasts . I liked breasts , had always liked womanly breasts . But now I loved her breasts . My hand involuntarily started to move gently across her nipple . She murmured . My erection returned . The telephone rang . She woke with a start and looked across my chest at the phone by the bedside . I looked at it and frowned . She looked up at me , questioning . I just let it ring , troubled by its implications , more complex than I could realize at the moment . Finally it stopped ringing , and Marianne dropped her head to my chest again . " I 'm not here . I do n't want anyone to know I 'm here . "  | " Did n't you tell anyone you were coming here ? " " No . I just told a few friends I was going away , to he alone , and that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face seriously . " Have I clone something wrong , breaking in on your being alone ? " I kissed her forehead . " People will find out you 're here , of course , sooner or later . I used to hear the phone ringing when I was on the beach . " " I hope they do n't find me . I really want to be alone . " She looked up again . " With you . " And I put my other arm around her and held her . My erection , which had died when the phone rang , came back , and she smiled and leaned down and kissed it . " We must do something about this . " I brought her head up to my chest again . " No . Not now . " " But does n't it hurt you if you do n't ? " " No , it 's a lovely feeling . I want to keep it for a while . I ca n't tell you how lovely . " " You have n't had your breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was very weak . How long since I 'd bantered with a girl . " Just lie there , and I 'll bring you breakfast . " " I hate breakfast in bed . My Puritan soul . My Calvinistsoul . " " Are you a Calvinist ? " " No , but in many things I might as well be . Terribly disciplined . " " I like that . " " It gets the world 's work done . It 's not always easy to live with . I mean , for a person to live with his own Calvinistsoul . " She reached out and touched my cheek and looked at me a long , long time , then smiled and shook her head in a sense of disbelief . She reached down by the side of the bed and pulledp143on her T-shirt . " We made a terrible mess of things , " indicatingour clothes on the floor and chairs . " Look the other way till I get my jeans on , " and she slid out of the bed . I understood her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different quality from her nakedness walkingaround the room . " Which bathroom shall I use ? " " Use the one there . I 'll use the one in our room . " We both caught the " our . " My friends at home had gently tried to get me to shift my pronouns from " our " to " my , " from " we " to " I. " But it was impossible . It was not my room . It was our room , Fran 's and mine . I did not do this and that , travel here and there . We did . It was useless to try to censor a person out of your life by changing pronouns . She ran water into the basin . I got out of bed quickly and grabbed my clothes from the floor and chair and went to our bedroom . I threw my clothes on the unmade bed and went into the bathroom . All Fran 's lotions and creams and sickroom things were there . As I closed the door , I saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond . I looked at myself in the mirror . A mess , sunkeneyed , unshaven . There had never been any pleasure for me to look at myself in full-length bathroom mirrors . But it was a shock now . Marianne 's loving had somehow transformed my body in my mind 's eye . Now I looked at it , long and poorly put together , and I wondered how she could have handled it so lovingly . There had not been any real change in my body since I was in my late teens , so I did not feel middle-aged or decrepit in that sense . I was just very white and not very prepossessing . I shaved quickly but carefully . I had forgotten my razor and had to use one Fran had for her legs . Then I showered , and as I dried myself , I could still feel Marianne'sbody , and I began to get excited and exhilarated by the stirring in my cock.  |p144In  the bedroom I opened the bureau and found some underpants and a sweater . I did n't like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the closet I looked for the khaki slacks I liked . They were too big around the waist . I knew I had lost weight in the last year , but not that much . I slipped into sneakers . From the time I was a kid , there was always something about getting into sneakers for the first time each year . They meant summer , outdoors , games , running , sloshing in the water on the beach . I combed my hair carefully in front of the mirror . I was going out to play . It was a fantastic feeling . I did n't think about anything except that there was this extraordinary girl out there who had dropped into my life . She was life , not death , and for some reason I could not understand , I functioned beautifully with her.  |p145In  the kitchen Marianne was opening and shutting cupboards . " I ca n't find a squeezer . " I got it for her . " Do n't look in that corner . There 's a dead mouse . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , it 's very dead . A long time . " I scraped it up in some cardboard and went outside and threw it into the brush and came back . Watching her cutting the oranges and getting the glasses did something to me . I came up behind her and put my arms around her and pressed myself against her . " You have an adorable bottom , do you know that ? " " Yes . " She giggled.  | " Good . That night at Miss A 's , your blue jeans all worn pale over your bottom . . . " I pressed my hardness to her . " You see , you should have let me take care of that . " " I want to preserve the feeling as long as possible . I have n't felt this way in . . . so long . " My hands cupped her breasts . " Kitchens do something to me . A woman being womanly . I do n't know . For other men it 's black nightgowns . For me it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd see a doctor about that if I were you . " And she wriggled her bottom against me . " That 's how it was with Fran the first time . She offered to cook me a dinner on our second date , and . . . we never ate the dinner . " She turned and smiled with that look of concern in her eyes . I let her go and reached for the coffee cups . " My friends tell me I should n't talk so much about Fran . " " I want to hear about her , and you . " She stopped squeezing the oranges and came to me . " You came down here to be alone . Whenever you want me to clear out , just say so . " I looked at her a long time and shook my head . " I was going to clear out this morning . I came down here yesterdaybecause I was desperately lonely , not for people , but for some meaningful human contact . And I knew , though it would be murderous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morbid , perhaps . But I was being driven crazy by the kind but essentially superficial contact with my friends . I wanted to find someone I could . . . let myself go with . . . and Fran was really the only one . Now . . . " I reached out and touched her check . I felt tears come into my eyes . I had thought there were no more tears after last night . Marianne came to me quickly and put her arms around me . This is what I had wanted . Someone to say , " You 've been hurt , you 're suffer/ing . It 's awful . It is n't just awful what 's happened to Fran . It 's awful what 's happened to you . " I made no sound . I stood there imposing my needs on this girl . How seldom in my life I had told anyone what I needed , or asked for it . But there I was with no defense against the urgency of my need . My mind was ashamed , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been alone the night before , convulsive , endless tears , but quiet tears in her hair punctuated with " I 'm sorry " and her cooing " Shhhh . " Within an hour or so I had rendered myself up to this girl whom I hardly knew . I had smothered her with my physical needs , my emotional urgencies . My tears were over in a few moments , and as I held her , I felt myself hardening against her . I shook my head at this contradiction . Something insists on living , on surviving , on seeking out its own interests and satisfactions . Marianne was obviously aware of my excitement , but this time she made no move . As I pulled my head away , still saying " Sorry , " she said , " Imagine loving anyone that much . " I was surprised at this . " Have n't you ? " " No . I wonder if I could . I envy you . " I needed to be honest , at least as honest as I could be at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . I ca n't tell you what it is . It just happens . But I think there must be some very unattractive motives , some very selfish ones . " " Well , that 's all right too . " " Thanks . " " Please do n't thank me again . " She looked very stern about it , although she was smiling . " Do you still feel like eating ? " " Yes . By all means . " She finished squeezing the orange juice and handed it to me . She held my eyes for a moment . " Thank you forp148that . " She nodded towards the corner where we had just been . " Why ? " " Just thank you . " And she turned back to the counter.  |p149A11  during breakfast I could n't keep my hands off her . I would reach out and touch her face , stroke her hair . Suddenly I would get up and crouch by her chair , pressing my face into her breasts , or stand beside her and press my hardness against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , but we had time , and the prolongation of the feeling was exciting . As I stood beside her , she would cup me through my khakis and whisper , " How 's my friend ? " " He 's fine . " She was a very tidy girl , insisting on cleaning up after breakfast and wanting to go beyond that and clean the whole kitchen . I pulled her away from that.  |p150We  stood in the living room with our arms around each other . I did n't want to stay in the house . I wanted to get in the car on this shining day and drive through the countryside with this girl . I wanted to show her all the lovely spots , the beaches , the old houses , the moors and marshes . Strangely , I wanted to shop with her . I wanted to push a cart for her in a market . Amazing how quickly I revertto the domestic . I wanted this lovely girl , but I wanted it to be domestic . And yet I had hated so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to do it alone , when Fran had been away . " I would like to put you in the car and drive you to all my favorite places , faraway beaches , junk shops , hot-dog stands . But . . . I do n't want to go out that gate . I have a feeling that once out there , I 'll pass someone , meet someone ... " There seem to be miles and miles of deserted beach right out there . Let 's walk there . " We left the deck and headed down the beach , arms around each other , stopping every once in a while to clutch each other tightly and exchange looks of disbelief , or kiss lightly on the cheek . I realized there were hundreds of things I did n't know about her , but I wondered if I wanted to ask . I felt that if I said , " Tell me something about yourself , " there would suddenly be a gulf between us . We hadleaped all formalities and clutched each other desperatelyin bed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , " Who are you ? " There was a dimension between us , also asimplicity which might be spoiled with particulars . Therewould come a time when touching , grasping and strokingwould not be enough , and we would want to know more . We picked up shells and unusual-looking stones . Ilooked for delicate white shells , while she hunted out eggsizedstones she said would make good paperweights forp151me . Finally we were tired , and flopped in the sand . I immediatelykissed her on the neck and started to nuzzle . " You know , you 're like a little puppy dog . " I thought of what Miss A had said . " Your puppy dogis waiting for you out there . . . " But I said , " I just can'tstand not being in contact with you . Does it annoy you ? " She laughed . " No . It 's lovely . " " I just ca n't get enough of touching you and holding you . I suppose there are all sorts of reasons why , which we could talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze it . " Side by side was not close enough for me . I stretched out , and curling my legs up behind her as a back rest , I put my head in her lap facing her belly . I pulled up her T-shirt and kissed her stomach . I thought of Fran . " The important thing is to be able to see your ribs . As long as you can see your ribs , you 're not fat . " She loathed fat people . " You know , you 're a surprise . " I looked up at this . Were we going to start to talk about us ? " In what way ? " " I do n't know . Just a surprise . " " A disappointment ? " She pressed my head to her stomach . " No . " " What had you expected ? Perhaps you 'd better not tell me . " She looked at me , obviously trying to be careful . " I had n't expected you to be so . . . physical . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give a very strange impression I 'm not aware of . An ascetic ? " " No , it 's not that . Maybe I do n't have much experience in these things . " " No , it 's been said before . Even when I was a kid , mothers would trust me with their daughters when they would n't let them out with other boys in our group . I alwaysfound it insulting , but in the end , rewarding . " I smiled  | " It 's a nice surprise . " She leaned down and kissed me . " It 's had its advantages . I get away with murder because I seem so innocent . " " What kind of murder do you get away with ? " She looked at me as though she had caught me . I shrugged . " If people were to see us together , for example , they never would suspect anything . He 's harmless . Besides , in this instance , he 's an old man , and she 's . . . How old are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs . " Were you ever unfaithful to Fran ? That 's a very little-girl question , I suppose . But in reading all the stories you write about marriage , and what other people have said , I won-dered . " Without hesitation I answered " No . " Because that 's what she wanted to hear . And because , though she would have understood Sarah , I was so ashamed , I could n't mention it . It hardly seemed an infidelity . Just something mechanical . And Jean . . . ? " I thought not . " " Remember , you only know what I want you toknow . " It was a poor saving of face for my conscience . She laughed in a kind of disbelief . " I 'm sure . " I raised myself on an elbow and stared at her . " Why do you stare at me so ? " " I just ca n't believe it . " " Am I a surprise ? " " I had no opinion of you . I knew from that night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . But we are a surprise . " " Are you glad ? " I leaned down and kissed her , and holding my lips to hers , moved my body closer to her . I covered her face with kisses . There was a smile on her face which seemed to be saying " I 'm glad you 're enjoying me . Find every place on me that gives you joy . "  |p153I  kissed her breast through the thin T-shirt and felt the nipples rise . Did we want to be together here , or did we want to wait ? I stopped suddenly . She opened her eyes . " Let 's go in the water and then back to the house . " She smiled , understanding that the water and the sun would only elevate us to another plateau of excitement . She half raised herself and looked up and down the beach . " Nobody . Nobody ever comes around here this early in the season . " She looked at me a moment . It was a new kind of nakedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood and kicked off my sneakers and took off my khaki pants . My cock was erect under my boxer shorts . She laughed . " I 'm sorry . It just looks so funny like that . " And she wriggled over on her knees to kiss it through my shorts , as though in apology . " It does not like to be treated as laughable . " " Oh , it 's not . It 's just that in your shorts like that . " " Well , then , we 'll take them off . " I pulled them offrather awkwardly . " Now , that 's something different . " She touched it , then started to laugh again . " You know , I once thought a man had three of these . " " Only pawnbrokers . " She rocked back , laughing . " Where the hell did you get that idea ? " " I do n't know . " " Come on . Let 's go ! " " You 've left your shirt on again . " I stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty was strange , but to be respected , no matter . I backed away from her a few yards . I had my own feelings of modesty about my behind . I then ran towards the water and recklessly and uncharacteristically plunged in . Immediately I leaped high up into the air to escape the cold , then sank into it again to wait for it to becomep154warm . I lay on my back and looked towards Marianne . She was bending over , taking off her jeans . I was filled with an incredible joy . The expectations and the certainties of the next few hours were beyond belief . The sun , the water , this enchanting girl and my own feeling of power and vigor . Uncomplicated . Pure . Sensual . Marianne came running down to the water . She had left on her T-shirt and her cotton panties . She was right . She had good instincts . There was something infinitely more erotic that way , though she probably had n't thought of it . I stood up and came towards her , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , but then taking long strides , she waded into the water and dived in and swam towards me with clean , strong strokes . " You 're quite a swimmer . " " I like it . " She stood next to me . The dark nipples clear through her wet T-shirt . I reached over and cupped one breast . " Let 's just swim for a few minutes . All right ? " She flashed a smile . " You go ahead . " I felt it was something she enjoyed doing alone . " Just for a few minutes . It 's such a fantastic day . " And she set off , moving swiftly and beautifully through the water . An exercise , a routine , a discipline . With slow , steady strokes , head down , head up , she kept going . It was indeed something she did well . I swam , then turned over on my back and floated . The sun beating on my face and exposed body . I looked out towards Marianne . Beyond her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes it into his mind to come in . I had n't thought about that . Friends with boats . We were quite far down from the house . They might not make the connection . Marianne was coming back in now . I turned over andp155swam towards her . There was something deliciously sensuousabout the flow of the water on my naked body , the movement of the ripples through my legs , almost caressing as my body turned with the strokes . As she approached , I stood up . The sensations had excited me again . She looked at me and laughed . " How can you swim with that like that ? " " As you can see , I do n't swim much . " I moved towards her . Shaking the water from her ears , she breathed deeply , still out of breath from her exercise . " Oh , that was lovely . Did you mind ? " " Of course not . " " I do n't like to just dunk in the water . I like to swim until I 'm tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lips . " Do n't go away yet . " I started to run my hands over her body . " The texture 's all different in the water . " I pulled her down and we moved about in the shallow water for a few moments , just staying afloat by kicking our feet , or shoving against the bottom . " Does n't it feel different ? " " Mmmm . " " You 're very smart , keeping your things on . " " Why ? " " It 's nice . " My hand ran down between her legs . " Different . " " I was just suddenly embarrassed . " " I understand . " I took one of her hands and guided it to my cock and balls . She immediately took the initiative . She looked at me . " Is that nice ? " I just closed my eyes and smiled . " Will you tell me what you like ? " " With pleasure . " Her fingers and the movement of the water were almost unendurable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went under water , and we separated , each struggling to gain balance . Coughing and laughing and choking , we headed for the beach . I suddenlyp156grabbed her and kissed her . " I ca n't stop touching you . " " It 's not something you have to apologize for . " And she ran up to where we had left our clothes . We had no towels . We stood looking down at our few clothes . I handed her my pullover to dry herself . We did n't want to sit wet in the sand . We looked at each other . " Let 's go back to the house . " She skinned her Tshirtover her head and pulled on my sweater , but not before I leaned over and kissed her breast . " Sorry . Now you can put it on . " She shook her head . We slogged back through the sand , arms around each other . We were in a hurry , The teasings and caresses and sensations of the morning had been building up . I made it difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I touched her panties . " Are n't these uncomfortably wet ? Do n't you want to take them off ? " She laughed . " I will . In time . " When we reached the house , we went to my study , where we had been earlier . I slid open the windows so that now the room was part of the sun-drenched deck . I threw my clothes on the chair and turned to Marianne . She was already in the bathroom with the door closed . I went to the linen closet and brought two fresh bath towels . I heard the shower running , and I opened the door . I moved to the shower stall and knocked on the glass door . She opened it and looked at me . " You 've been away for two minutes . " I stepped into the stall . She was glisteningwith soap . I held her to me , running my hands up and down over the slippery surface of her skin . She looked at me and smiled . " Another texture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to me , my cock hard between our bellies . " I do n't know how to expressit . I feel I would like to press you right into me , to absorb you . " My hands cupped her bottom and pressed it still harder to me . I held her like that for a moment , thenp157the wave passed , and I stepped away . I took the soap from the dish and moved my hands between her legs . " I 've already done that . " " It needs doing again . " And I ran my soapy hand up her legs . The sensation was almost too much . I reached my hand through with my strokes to her bottom . " No . No . " And she tightened and wriggled away . She took the soap and started to wash me . I winced with the sensation . " That 's enough , " and moved away from her . I turned on the cold water , and we both gasped . I turned it off , and opened the stall door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took her towel and insisted on helping . She tried to dry me at the same time , and as we got tangled up in arms and legs and towels , we both started laughing and she said , " I think it 's simpler if we each do ourselves . " " Simpler , but not as much fun . " I kissed her belly button . She backed away , and for a few moments we worked on ourselves . But then I moved to the toilet seat and started on her again . " This needs special attention , " and I gently started to dry between her legs . She just stood there looking down at me , smiling , enjoying the gentle rubbing . Suddenly I dropped to my knees and began kissing her belly , and then her hair down there , and then opening my mouth , I moved lower . She moved away slightly , and I looked up and saw her frowning . " Why not ? " " I do n't know . " " You kissed me there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading look of distaste on her face . " It 's very nice for me . You 're lovely all over , you know . " Still the little frown . I was n't going to force it . Obviouslythere was a story . I might hear it in time . I justp158pressed my lips to her hair again , my hands stroking her bottom , and then I stood up . . . and we moved out of the steamy bathroom to the sunlit bedroom.  |p159|pulled  the curtains partway closed so that the sun would not be in our eyes . When I turned hack to the bed , she was lying face down , her head buried in the pillow . I crouched on the bed next to her and leaned down and lightly brushed my lips over her back . She shivered . I blew on her hack , gently , as though I might he cooling something . She giggled . I ran my hand the full length of her hack . It was so beautiful and strong , and even lying like this , proud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden double image of the indelible-ink crosses on Fran 's spine . I shut my eyes and quickly kissed her bottom , seeking by some immediate strong sensation to blot out the crosses.  |p160While  I was kissing , I moved my hand up her legs and began to caress her . Then I realized I did n't want to " do things " to Marianne . I had " done things " to Sarah in the messy , dingy apartment . We had " done things " to each other , to excite , stimulate , even humiliate to the point of excitement . I wanted to touch and kiss and feel Marianne , but it must not be " doing things , " mechanical tricks . I lay on my back next to her . She raised herself on her hands and slid over so that her breasts were above my face . It was a lovely invitation . I raised my head . " Sometimes it happens for me just from having my breasts kissed . " It was a challenge I accepted , but after a minute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guided me into her . Her face flushed from her position . Her eyes closed , she began . Again I experienced this strange sense of control and power . Though it was enormously exciting , I felt I could go on forever , that I could will almost whatever I wanted . This extreme control was something new to me and added pleasure in performance to pleasure in the act . Why was it happening ? I thought of other times , sometimes with Fran , when I had been too fast , and I had flushed when I had heard that psychologists interpreted this as an expression of hostility , resentment , a desire to frustrate and disappoint . Disappoint Fran ? Why ? Marianne started to murmur , and her breath came more sharply , and I thought , " Shall I hold on ? I could . " There was an impulse to exploit this new control , to revel in it . But I sensed we would not be together again that afternoon . It was not a time for sexual athletics . That was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , contortedin concentration , eyes tightly closed . Imagining what ? I lay there conscious of the power to give her pleasure . I almost smiled at her determination to press on to her own completion , aware all over again that sex is atp161once selfish , selfless , together but alone , impulsive , calculated , colored by all the hues of each personality . There was something demanding in Marianne . I wondered how she could say , " It 's nice just to have you inside me . " The pitch of her involvement was so intense that I imagined she would be half crazed with frustration if she did n't achieve orgasm , once she had been aroused . She came in a series of short climaxes , separated by ten or fifteen seconds . And then I knew she was through , and though I had not come , I had pretended . I almost laughed . I , pretending ! She half turned over on her side , I still inside her . She had n't opened her eyes . Her long dark lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suddenly felt like an intruder . I did not think she wanted me to share the tears . I did not think she wanted to be comforted . I slowly withdrewand reached down for the sheet to cover us . Though we did n't need it in the bright sunlight , it seemed called for . She turned her back to me and drew herself up in a semi-fetal position . I turned on my side and put my arm around her . In a few moments she was asleep . I stared blankly over her shoulder out the window at the water and the sky and the white clouds . It is a strange thing that I find impossible to explain , but often during the months and years when I knew Fran was dying , I would walk along the street and would say to myself , " How will I think of her when she is gone ? " And for no reason that I can understand , I came to attach her to white , floating clouds . As I looked at the clouds over Marianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted the mirage , the oasis to vanish , and I longed for the desert again . That was my life . Fran 's death was my life . Though I had not been drained sexually by orgasm , still I sensed " the little death . " The relationship of this day with Marianne was over . It had saved me , but now the rest of my life rushed in with ap162completely different kind of urgency and richness . I wassad , frowning . Wondering why , I finally sensed it was asthough I had been listening to some overpoweringly beautifulmusic and thinking , " I wish this had been with Fran . " But it had n't been like this with Fran for years . The telephone rang . Marianne started out of her sleep , raised her head . I held her tighter . We listened to it ring till it stopped . " I must go in a few minutes . " I did n't protest . I just kissed her shoulder . " I have n't asked you anything about how you like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me . " Are you going to stay down ? " I looked at her and then smiled . " Yes . " I kissed her lightly . " People will sooner or later find you 're here . " " I suppose so . " " Where will you shop , ? How will you get food ? " " I 'll go out under the cover of night . Some town far enough away from here . Where are you living ? " " Over Mrs. Grader 's barn . " " Yes , I remember that . " Fran had lived there as an apprentice . " I could bring you things . Shop for you . " I did n't want her to move into the cottage with me . I wanted her , but I did n't want her there , living there . " I 'm involved at the theatre , of course , most of the time , and they like us to watch performances at least a few times a week , but there would be time . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps sensed my feelings of withdrawal . She looked at me a long time . " May I come here . . . some-times ? " I smiled at her and kissed her . " What a question ! "  | " Well . . . " " Please come . " " I only want to come when you want me . How will I know ? I ca n't call you . " I thought of Fran 's signal , two calls in quick succession . But then , if I started answering the phone , someone might find the line busy , and the local operator . . . I touched her face . " Please come whenever you can . " I found myself excited by what I had said , by this kind of commitment to this girl . A moment ago I had wanted her to go away . And now I had said " come whenever you can " and had been moved by my saying it . And yet wondering if I really meant it . " Why do n't you tie a dishtowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " All right . " She sat up and moved to the edge of the bed . I reached over and touched her long , lovely back , and then moved to her quickly and kissed her and held her for a moment . She was sad , perhaps just the normal sadness after sex , and I wanted to hold her . I could never stand the abrupt change that sometimes came after making love , as though it were the end of something rather than just an episode in a continuing feeling . Marianne slipped into her jeans while I watched . She turned and smiled . " I 'm no longer embarrassed . " Her Tshirtwas still wet . " Wear my sweater . " She pondered this for a moment . I thought , There 's a whole bureau full of things in " our " room , but it would offend Marianne if I had offered them to her . I watched her pull the sweater over her naked breasts , then turn to the mirror and brush her still-damp hair . Watching Marianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thought for a moment of pulling her back to bed , but I also wanted her to go . She went into the bathroom , and I quickly got out ofp164bed and slipped into my trousers and sneakers . When she came out again , we just stood and looked at each other for a long moment . Then we smiled and shook our heads in acknowledgment of what had happened between us . " We strike the set tonight , and tomorrow 's setting up and dress rehearsal , and more rehearsing Monday . . . " It sounded as though she were outlining a schedule which would make it difficult for her to come back . I thought of David and his avenues of retreat . And my own . " I know you 're busy . Come when you can . " That sounded very casual . What were we doing here , offering each other open doors ? " What will you do here ? " " Oh , lots of things . " I smiled . " I find myself doing all the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did . " I shook my head . I kissed her . " I 'll be here . " With my arm around her , I walked her out of the bedroomonto the deck and around to the shed where she had left her bicycle . Now that she was about to go , I did n't want her to go . We held each other without saying anything , then she kissed me quickly and walked her bike into the yard with her long , strong strides , mounted it , and rode off . Just beforeshe entered the tree-lined road , she waved without looking back , and though she could n't see me , I waved too.  |p165I  turned back to the cottage , walked around to the deck and went in by the door to my study . As I lay on the bed and looked at the ceiling , I could still feel Marianne 's body on my body . It had been that way in the beginning with Fran . We had just lain on her couch in her room for hours on end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early hours of the morning , I could feel the pressure of her body long after I had turned out the light in my own room fifteen miles away . I felt very much at peace , as I had felt the first time with Fran when it had been for the most part an emergencefrom the grubby world of adolescence , with grabbed opportunities in dark and furtive places , morbid and soli/tary fantasies and practices . And then suddenly a sense of rightness and of focus . But again I felt the sadness , not the sadness of Fran 's death , but sadness for the loss we had suffered long before , long , long before . Sadness and guilt in some ways more troubling than her death . I had tried . We had tried . Fran , I think , more to humor me , perhaps knowing that I would not accept what was supposed to be inevitable . It was too bleak . That was for other people who did not try hard enough . If only we tried , we could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other people . Had she been depressed at my periods of silent moodiness , periods when she must have known I was wondering " Why ? "  --  periods which ended with another try , and still another . " Depressed people are very susceptible to diseases , even things like cancer . " Once she had decided to leave me , because she felt she was making me sad . But she did n't leave . She had simply taken a position as an actress in residence for a semester , and then returned . Nobody had ever known of this , and she had n't told me till long after . " These things happen . " But that 's too simple . Why ? How often affectionate impulses were stifled by some resentmentor hurt or insensitivity ! My longing , and her longing too , to hold , to press , to fondle and kiss and lie all over each other on the couch . But inherent in doing this was forgiveness for slights and hurts . " Everything is all right , then ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , to imply forgiveness . And it is impossible to love freely and still hold resentments in reserve or abeyance . By your insensitivityyou have hurt me or belittled me or been completelyunaware of my feelings , but tonight I need you . I do not need you specifically , my wife , my husband . I need a body . And so it all becomes fragmented and so rarely all together . Tonight because I am lonely . Tonight because Ip167think I did a good job today . Tonight because you are depressed . Tonight because we both drank too much at the party and we can overcome our resentments and defenses and have at each other desperately and lie back exhausted and wonder why it ca n't be like this always . And for the next day , stay clear of differences , pretendingthat our free and urgent coming together proved that basically we are good together . Intimacy which passed for the real intimacy we had somehow lost , and then found in the days of her dying and now had lost forever . Marianne had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran had said that and I had not believed her . But Marianne had gone on to her own release , and many times nothing had happened for Fran , and I had suggested we go back to ways we had known , things we had done before we were married , but she had said " No . I just like the feel of you in inc . It does n't matter that I do n't come . " And often I had felt diminished , inadequate , and had sometimes for long periods stayed away from her , avoiding contact or closenesswhich might lead to contact , unwilling to face again this defeat , this feeling of inadequacy , yet troubled and angry that she would not let me help her in other ways . And then sometimes we would manage . That strange night in Vienna when suddenly for no reason she was open to everything , taking the initiative , possessed . And the sense of relief for both of us . But in the end the relief only telling me that " just you in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really ? If it had been , how sad ! The nights we could have been close . I turned my head and saw Fran in her white flannel nightgown standing in my doorway , her face lit up with an extraordinary wild smile . " Look , I 'm walking . I made it from our bedroom without my canes . " I had smiled and said , " That 's marvelous , " knowing she would soon be dead . I turned and buried my head in the pillow , trying top168block out all the compounding sorrows and guilts . " Man is in love and loves what vanishes . " Loves it with a guilt for not having loved it more while he had it . I wanted Fran back so that we could play it all over again and have it different.  |p169I  looked at my watch . Ten o'clock . I had been asleep on the couch for almost an hour . I had slept for a couple of hours after Marianne had left , and now this hour after writing letters . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the large table I had cleared around four o'clock for Fran 's letters . Seven letters written , long letters , interrupted by a supper of hash , a sliced tomato , half a head of lettuce , and coffee . The letters had drained me . Letter by letter I had reinforcedthe image I would hold of Fran , the image I could live with , the image I wanted people to live with.  |p170I  reached for my drink on the floor beside the couch . What happens now ? Only ten o'clock . The phone rang . Nobody but Marianne would call at this hour . I wanted to hear from Marianne . There was at last somebody I wanted to call . But our being together was perhaps dependent on my not answering . When she came back , we would have to arrange something . " When she came back . " Would she come back ? How had we left it ? We 'd left it that she could n't reach me . I would n't answer the phone . No plan for a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ridiculousafter our day together . Yet there had been caution , the usual almost compulsive caution , or why had n't I made plans with her ? Partly out of consideration for her . We had said practically nothing . What we had done had been spontaneous . I had wanted her to leave when she did , and she had sensed it , or had she sensed my need to be alone before I expressed it ? Did I express it ? No . I was just " that way . " How would we be at our next meeting ? There would inevitably be some shyness , awkwardness as we went back to " introductions " and got to know each other . Who is she ? What are her commitments ? Does she have any ? Is she thinking it all over now ? What would she be doing now ? I looked at my watch again . In a little while she 'd be helping to strike the set and move in the new one for next week 's show . They used to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I realized that we were not going to drift together again as we had the first time . Someone would have to make a move . She might come down again " for a swim , " but she could hardly do that now . She knew what coming down would mean . I could drive to the next town and call her from ap171phone booth . Call her where ? Nobody 's answering phones at the theatre now . I doubted she had a phone in her room , and I could n't wake Mrs. Grader . I could drive out . It was late now . The village was asleep except for the town constable driving around . If she was through at the theatre , she might be in her room over Mrs. Grader 's barn . Maybe she shared the room with anothergirl . Fran and I had lived in that room her first summer . I had n't asked her if she lived alone . I had n't asked her anything . And if she did live alone . Barging in in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , need time . But I wanted to be in touch with her ! " Touch " was the word . I wanted to touch her , to hold her . I wanted to tell her everything this day had meant to me . It was unthinkable to spend such a day with a girl and not reach her in some way . What kind of man is that ? In town I would have rushed out for armsful of flowers . Much of the pleasure of being in love is to rush out and buy things , silly things , oddities with hidden meanings known only to the two of you . An orgy of trivia which would show up years later , treasured in the back of a bureaudrawer . To overwhelm someone with significant small attentions . When Fran had not received an acting award she had deserved , I had learned of her itinerary for the following day and at each stop , hairdresser , fitter , luncheon , doctor , I had arranged to have her met with a small nosegayof flowers along with copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My desk at home was practically awash with such mementos  --  a porcelainmouse nibbling on cheese , small paperweights , a china jar from Fortnum and Mason which had contained some caviar we had had on some special occasion . Tomorrow I must go into the next village and get Marianne some silly things . But tonight . To be in touch.  |p172Something  ! Some object I could get to her which would not embarrass her if she came home with a roommate . My eye fell on a few of the smooth stones we had found on the beach this morning.  |p173The  village was quiet . No lights in the houses . At the far end of the green was the town hall , converted to a theatre in the summer . Lights were on but there was no activityoutside the building . A car passed , and I rubbed the side of my face as it went by . Would they recognize the car ? Then I remembered that I had a new station wagon since I 'd been here last . In a village like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and it 's months before you get that finger of recognition barely lifted from the steering wheel . I drove slowly past the theatre . There were a few cars in the parking lot and a few bicycles in the rack at the side of the theatre . Was one of them Marianne 's ? I drovep174closer and saw her red bike with the basket . I could leave the stone in the basket . Would she see it ? It was only as big as an egg . I could leave it on the seat of the bike . She might knock it off in the dark without seeing it . I moved away from the theatre and down the street the few blocks to Mrs. Grader 's house . I looked down the dark , shaded path to the barn . There was a light on at the top of the steps , just outside Marianne 's door . If Mrs. Grader were awake , she would have already heard the car slow down . In the country a person can hear a car stop in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up and down the stairs before she could really be aware of anything , since she did n't have a view of the back of the barn and the stairs . Still , the bicycle was perhaps a better idea . I was right . In my rear-view mirror I could see the yard light go on . I stopped a few blocks from the theatre and wrapped the stone in my handkerchief . Then I slowly approached the theatre , drove up as close as I could to the bicycles and hurried over to Marianne 's and tied the ends of the handkerchiefaround her handlebar , got back in the car and drove away , my heart pounding . It felt good to be out and away from the cottage , and I wanted to drive for a while . I wanted to drive in and out of the streets of the village and perhaps wait until Mariannecame out of the theatre and watch her find the stone . But that was not a good idea . The village was in effect a mutual protection association , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . I took a chance and drove once more past the barn . The yard light was still on , and I did n't slow down . I just went right on and took the next turn that would lead me to the main road . As I drove , I did n't want to go back to the cottage . I wanted to go back to the barn and up to Marianne 's room , and get into that big bed and wait for her . I assumed thatp175it was the same as when Fran and I had been there many , many years before . A great old room with a fireplace and window seats , exposed beams . I had an almost overwhelmingdesire to be absorbed into Marianne 's life . " Take care of me . " The image I had of myself in the bed was curled up , a child , a baby . I would just stay there curled up for days and days and wait for her to come home and care for me . I had an enormous longing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilly , and I turned back towards the cottage . Perhaps when she found the stone , Marianne might come down . This was ridiculous , a three-mile bike ride after midnight . But she might . No one saw me enter my drive . It was a couple of hundred yards before I could see the house and the lights . I felt a pang as I remembered how Fran and I had liked to go outside on a summer night and walk around the house saying how cozy it looked all lit up . We would look in the windows and say , " This is a nice house . I wonder who lives here ? " I drove the car into the shed and entered the house . I was about to turn off the outside light when I stopped . I knew it was ridiculous , but I left it on . An hour later I turned it off and went to bed and fell asleep immediately.  |p176I  awoke the next morning smelling burnt toast . I lay back , smiling . My God ! I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup and saucer and making a little sound of annoyance when she did . I just lay there for a few moments , enjoying the prospect . Then I called out , " I can hear you trying to be quiet . " She burst out laughing . " Are you awake ? " " Yes . I 'll be there to help you in a moment . " " You stay right where you are . I 'm getting you breakfastin bed . " " I hate breakfast in bed . You have n't read my books . All my men hate breakfast in bed . " " Well , you 'll have to put up with it for once , becausep177I 've been planning this all night . Go to the bathroom and do whatever you have to do and get back into bed . " I went to the bathroom , then padded down through the living room to the kitchen . Her back was to me . She was wearing my red sweater , her jeans and sneakers . I came up behind her and put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were supposed to stay in bed . " " I 'll get back in whenever you 're ready . " My hand was on her breast . She looked back at me and kissed me . We looked at each other for a serious moment . " I missed you . " I missed you too . Thank you for the stone . " " Crazy . I wanted to be in touch with you so badly . I thought of writing you a letter , but then I figured if I left that on your steps and you had a roommate , it might embarrassyou . Do you have a roommate ? " " No . " She went on with the breakfast . " All that ingenuity for nothing then . " " I loved the stone . It was just right . Just enough . I slept with it under my pillow . " She turned and looked at me . My erection was bulging in my pajamas . She laughed . " Is that a permanent state with you ? " " I wish it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She put the bacon on paper toweling . " I snuck down to your bedroom when I arrived , and there you were all sprawled out , the covers off you , and just like that . " She pointed at my pajamas . " Only it was all out in the open . It was very funny . You sound asleep but our friend very much awake . " " Most men wake up with erections . Did n't you know ? " She looked at me quickly . I should n't have asked that question . " No . " And she put the things on the tray . " Now run back and get in bed and be surprised and grateful like a normal man should be . Go on ! "  |p178I  went through the living room and into my room and jumped into bed and pulled the covers up and sat there grinning , as she followed , carrying the tray with the orange juice , bacon and eggs , toast ( scraped ) and coffee . Also a glass with a rose in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . She held the tray and hovered over me for a moment , looking at my lap . " Is it safe to put the tray down ? " We both laughed , and she put the tray on my lap and sat on the bed next to me . My laugh faded to a smile and then to a look of complete adoration . I reached out quickly and drew her to me , just holding her . Then I drew back and looked at her , and shook my head . She kissed me lightly . " You need a shave . " " You did n't complain yesterday . " " I know you better now . I feel I can be frank with you . " She smiled and reached out and touched my face . " You have a button off your pajamas . I 'll see if I can find one to match . " I was infinitely touched by this small domestic gesture . I kissed her . " I keep wanting to kiss you . " " Eat your breakfast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tell me after breakfast . " " Have you had your breakfast ? " " Hours ago . I only take juice and coffee anyway . I 'll have a second cup with you . " " You cycled down here in this fog ? " " It is n't bad until you get right down here . " She watched each mouthful . I could n't keep my hands off her , or my eyes off her eyes , large , intent . I touched her face and looked at her for a moment , seriously . " How are you ? " " I 'm fine . " She smiled . " How are you ? " " Fine . I worried about you . " " I worried about you . "  | " Why ? " " You tell me first . " I nibbled a piece of toast . " I do n't know . It was all so marvelous , so perfectly right . But then being out of touch with you , I began to worry that you might be having secondthoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly lonely for you . You know , all the time I was working at the theatre last night , I could still feel you here . " She put her hand on her breast . " I could feel you too . That 's nice , is n't it ? " " I 'd never had that . . . lingering feeling before . " She broke into a broad smile . " I guess nobody ever held me so hard before . " " Nobody ever needed you as much before . " I put the tray aside . I had to hold her . " You have n't finished . " " I just want to hold you . " I quickly drew her to me . " You 're so incredibly dear . " " I like that word . I do n't think anyone has ever called me that before . I mean , they 've never said You 're dear . ' " I just groaned and held her , feeling the young resilienceof her body . I began to put my hand under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're out of luck today . " " What do you mean ? " " I 've got the curse . " Instinctively I drew her closer and rubbed my face against her hair . She went on . " Bad timing . " " I 'd say perfect timing . You did n't have it yesterday . " " That 's right . " I just held her for a few moments . She reached over to the tray and snitched a piece of toast . I hesitated before I went on . I did n't want her to misunderstand . " You know , it does n't bother me , your having . . . if it does n't bother you.  |p180She  looked at me . " It bothers me . " " Okay . I just wanted you to know that there is absolutely nothing about you that I could possibly find . . . distasteful . " " I should think it would be awful . " " No . " She shrugged her feeling of discomfort about it , then abruptly changed the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Liar . " She snuggled down next to me . " I have the most terrible desire to have you hold me . But if it 's going to make it difficult for you and our friend . . . " I drew her down close to me and eased myself to a prone position . " He loves it . " " I always thought it was painful like that , if nothing happened . " " It 's a totally bearable pain . " Then I intruded on her world again . " That 's an old line with boys , to tell you how painful it is and you 've got to do something about it . " She nestled her head in the crook of my neck for a long moment while I stroked her hair . " Do you want me to . . . do something about it ? " " No . . . No . " I kissed her hair . " I will . I 'd like to , if you want me to . " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her " thank you " and just look at her . " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " As I held her , I wondered . It would have been very exciting to have her " do something for me " but , in another way , it was almost more exciting to say " No . " One day we might do this together , or something else . Her willingness to " oblige , " to " service " was very touching and a little sad . And it told me something of whatever relations she 'd had with boys . But at that moment it was important to my feelings about myself to say " No , " to say , in effect ,  |p181that  man does not always have to be served . He is capable of an unselfish act . Perhaps I was being sentimental . I knew that there were times when a woman enjoyed being regarded simply as a sex object , enjoyed being used , even degraded . I held her tight . She was indeed " dear , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really true ? Fran had been an open girl . ) She grappled me to her . " Hold me hard ! I want to feel you there the rest of the day . " I held her hard . " I suppose this is not so good on a full stomach . " " It 's delightful any time . " I relaxed my grip on her . Her hand stole down my belly and to my erection . She began to fondle me . I reached down and took her hand and moved it away . " Are you sure ? " " Sure . " " But what if I want to ? " " Then I would know it . " I kissed her and sat up . " Let 's get up and start a fire and lie on the couch , and neck like a couple of kids . " I realized suddenly that , of course , she was a kid . I leaned back and kissed her . " Do kids still neck , or is it all . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face . " We neck . " As I started to get dressed , she looked the other way . " Missing a good deal if they do n't neck . I used to say to Fran . . . " I stopped . " I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to go on talking about what Fran and I did . " She smiled . " I hope to hear a lot more . . . if you 'll tell me . " She left for the kitchen with the tray , and I finished dressing , shaved quickly , and went to the living room to make a fire . It occurred to me that my apology was to the wrong person . It should have been to Fran for discussing us with someone else . She had always hated this . " You 've been talking about us to friends . "  |p182Listening  to Marianne in the kitchen , I wanted to join her and watch her and hold her . For me the need was still very much to hold , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship we would have spent the next days touching , holding , cuddling , romping , swimming , walking , shopping , laughing , eating , fucking . Affectionateanimals . On safe , mutually pleasurable ground . Now with Marianne 's period , we would be possibly defining ourselves , expressing attitudes , opinions . There had been a girl I had slept with early on in college , and we had had a great time until we had gone to the college art museum one day and argued violently over styles of painting . We had both apologized later , but it had never been the same and we drifted apart . Marianne brought in a tray with two cups of coffee , napkins , cream and sugar . A very neat girl . I took the tray from her and kissed her . " When you become bored with my compulsion to touch and kiss you , please do n't say so . " She laughed as we sat on the couch . " I 'm the one who asked to be held . " And she curled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stone ? " " I just wanted desperately to be in contact with you . It seemed all wrong after the day we 'd had , for us to be apart . It just seemed cold . " She kissed my hand , which was on her shoulder . " I did n't know the setup at Mrs. Grader 's . Sometimes two people have that room over the barn . " " When I found the stone , I almost laughed out loud . It was so dear . Then I went to the phone booth by the post office , and I was going to call you , the double ring that you and Fran used as a signal , but then I did n't . For a lot of reasons . First , your hearing that signal ring in this house . Then I thought you might feel you had to answer , and I knew you did n't want to answer the phone . Then I thought I 'd ride down here . " " I wish you had . " " Do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in/truding . The stone was charming but a touch ambiguous . It said I 'm thinking of you . ' It did n't seem to say Hurry down ! ' " She had caught every nuance of what I myself had n't really known I had meant . " I left the outside light on till I went to bed . " " Did you ? " " I did n't really expect you to come all that way at night on your bike . " " That 's one thing that kept me from coming . " She did n't mention the other reasons . " How are we going to keep in touch ? " " I 'll just be here whenever you feel like coming down . " " I want it the other way around . Not you waiting for me , but for me to come whenever you want me . " I hugged her . " That 's impossible , your just sitting here . There may be times when you do n't want me to come clown . How will I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew there might be , but at that moment I did n't want to think about reservations . She squeezed my hand , acknowledging the commitmentbut too wise to believe it . " There are times when I have to be alone . " " Of course . " " Do you mind being alone ? " She turned to look at me as though it were a question that concerned her more than me . " I have always said I do n't , because I 've had to be alone a lot . Fran 's work , and for that matter , my own work . I love solitude . I hate being lonely . I not only hate it , it frightens me . " " I 'd rather he by myself than have a lot of chatter-ing . " " Did you read that in one of my books ? "  |p184She  looked at me , surprised . " No . Did you write that someplace ? " " I must have , because it 's the way I feel . It 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people , ca n't always be that meaningful , significant . It 's nice when it is . " I tightened my grip on her and kissed her hair . " When I say to boys , people , that I do n't think I want to get married , they say I 'll be lonely . I think I 'd rather put up with that than the loneliness I sense in most of the marriages I 've seen . " I smiled . " That 's an enormous subject . In a way it 's a choice of which loneliness you can stand . " She looked at me , puzzled . " Your marriage is the only one I know about that seems to have been what marriage should be . " I tightened my hold on her shoulder . " I 'm sorry . Do you want me to shut up ? " " No . " " I told you that when I knew I was winning the award , I read everything I could about Fran and you , everything you had written about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your stories , which I took to be at least somewhat autobiographical , and . . . I do n't know . . . the way you worked together , appreciated each other 's talents , encouraged them , respected each other , maybe that kind of marriage . . . " I did n't say anything . I felt uncomfortable listening to her , yet it was what I wanted to hear . I curled in closer around her , wishing really that I could change positions with her and that she could hold me . Odd quick changes of feeling , sometimes to want to be with her as a man , flaunt the pleasure of my reawakened virility , sometimes to want to be held and comforted . After a long silence , she asked , " Do I make you happy ? " " Do n't you know you do ? " " I also make you a little sad . A little . "  | " No . " I kissed her cheek . " If I ever make you sad . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know from what you write that you 're a fiercely moral person . " " Oh , come on . " " Maybe that 's not the right word . But if what we do troubles you , makes you have any troubled feelings , then I 'd hate myself . " She looked at me seriously . " Do you understand what I mean ? " " Yes . " I kissed the end of her nose . " Do you think I should have troubled feelings , being such a moral person ? " She smiled , but also frowned . " Do n't tease about it . It 's a part of you that 's very important to me . I feel very right about it all , but if you did n't . . . " " I , too , feel that it 's all very right . But I have a very selfish interest in thinking that . Does that change your feelings about me ? " She snuggled against my chest . " I have a feeling I 've committed a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then you do feel I should feel troubled . " " No , I do n't want you to . Oh , I 'm saying it all very badly . I should n't have said that . " " My mother , who lives in England , is having a very hard time getting over Fran 's death . She 's gone . into some kind of deep mourning , has canceled all her engagements , and so on . I wrote her that I did n't think she should do this . I said that nothing any of us did now could make any difference to Fran . " She took my hand and kissed it . " That 's nice . " She was comforted but not convinced . Nor was I.We just lay there for a few moments , feeling the pressure of each other . " You know , I have n't asked you anything about how you 're getting on here at the theatre , if you 're enjoying it . " " Oh , yes , I am . It 's a fabulous opportunity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned and beamed at me . " Are you going to get a chance to act ? " " I think so . I 'll know soon , but just being around , watching actors develop parts . I 've always played a little small , a little tight . Miss A 's been trying to get me to open up , vocally , physically . I always listened to her , but I could never quite grasp the idea . Well , the first week of rehearsals , watching some of the pros , I knew immediately what Miss A was talking about . " " So now you have opened up physically and vocally ? " She swept her arm out in a grand gesture and boomed out , " How now , brown cow ! " and laughed . " Tremendous ! " I looked at her mouth , smiling . Her whole face lit up when she smiled , the big dark intense eyes shone . I shook my head . " What ? " For years I had written of and believed in married people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions , loving more desperately , more really . Did I believe it ? Compared to this ? Yes , I believed it , had done it . But this . I longed to be ignorantly drunk with this girl and the possibilities . For a time not to know what I knew . In so many areas of my life I had learned to hold back because I knew too much . Commitments to causes which faded away , to ideals which were compromised . " I adore you . " It was too much . She parried , smiling , " I 'd rather you found me dear . " " I do . Dear and adorable . . . and funny . " " I 'm not funny . Nobody has ever found me funny . " " I do . Funny and witty . " " What have I said that 's witty ? " " You just are . " " I 'll believe you because it makes me feel good . I do feel good with you . " She pressed her face into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p187I  stroked her cheek . " I wish we could get in a car and take off and drive all over New England , do whatever we wanted to do , picnic , antiquing , country inns with big feather beds . I have a tremendous desire to go shopping with you . " " Shopping ? " " I 'd like to buy you things , clothes , trinkets . I miss not having someone to buy things for . " " I do n't want you to buy things for me . " " If I want to , you must let me . I would get great pleasure in browsing through stores looking for things you might like . It will please me seeing you wear things I 've picked out . It will keep me close to you when we have to be apart . " She looked at me  --  at this unconscious projection of our life together . A car door slammed outside . I sat bolt upright , almost pushing Marianne away from me . I rose from the couch and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . It was Frank in his pickup truck . He had n't been there to take care of the place all spring . What instinct brought him here today ? He was one of the last of the originals . Way back when Fran and I had first bought the place , he had showed up the second morning and just lingeredaround out on the lawn until we came out to ask him what he wanted . " You bought this place ? " " Yes . " " Well , I come with the place . " And he laughed . He must have been about fifty or so then , and ever since he had taken care of the grounds and the cottage . The last time I had seen Frank had been at his wife 's funeral , last September , just before we had left . I quickly opened the kitchen door and went out to meet him before he could reach the house . He was at thep188side of the house where Marianne had used the lawnmowerand cultivated the roses . " Hello , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the place . Was n't sure what you wanted . " We shook hands . He was looking over the grounds . " You want me to , I can come down tomorrowwith my rig , get the place in shape . " " No , thanks , Frank . Maybe later . I do n't know how long I 'm going to be here , and just now I 'd like to leave it . Just want to hole up . " He looked at me . " Do n't blame you . I wanted to do that when Helen passed away . But I had the girl . " The girl was his mentally deficient daughter , now probably in her thirties . " I used to come down here evenings last winter , light a fire and smoke a pipe . Hope you do n't mind . " " I 'm glad you did , Frank . " " I filled up the wood box again . " " You did n't have to do that . " " Read one of your books . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sitting there night after night looking at that wall of books , I got up one night and looked closer and came across one of yours . Ca n't say I understood it all , but I liked it . " " I 'm very pleased . How are you ? How are you making out ? " " Just came down to take a look . Someone said they saw some kids coming through the gate . Thought I 'd bettercheck it out . " " Thanks , Frank . Probably some kids from the theatre . I do n't mind if they use the beach . " He broke a dead stalk from a plant . " Got myself marriedagain , did you hear ? " " No . Congratulations ! " I patted his back . " Nothing to be congratulated about . Would n't havep189done it except for the girl , you know . Someone to look after her . " " Who is it , Frank ? Do I know her ? " " Girl friend of mine from when I was a kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances . She do n't play piano no more and hates for me to fiddle . I go out and fiddle in the silo . " " Well , when I leave , Frank , come over here and fiddle . " " Fiddle makes a pretty sound in the silo . " He moved off , looking at the roof of the house . " I patched a couple of places on the roof , the wind blew off . Earn my keep . " He smiled at me . " Thanks . The place seems in good shape . " I turned and saw Marianne 's bicycle leaning against the shed , her scarf tied to the handlebar . Frank could n't have missed it . He walked around a few moments , feeling the paint , checking on repair jobs he 'd done over the years . ' ' Thought you might bring Mrs. Larsen up here . I pass Helen 's grave every day on the way to town . " " I thought of it , Frank , but we decided on back there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . Nice woman . " He poked around the windows . " Looks like the shutters could stand some touching up . " " Maybe when I leave . " I looked through the window , wondering if Marianne could be seen . " Lots of junk mail in your box . Did n't think you were here when I saw it . " " I thought I 'd fool people , Frank . If Bessie saw the box empty next time she delivered the mail , the cat would be out of the bag . " " People gon na see you around . " " I 'm not going to be around , if I can help it . I 'd appreciate it , Frank , if you did n't tell anyone , even your wife . "  | " Lettie ? " He snorted . " Hardly speak to her as it is . But she looks after the girl , kind of . Never would have done it except for the girl . People around here thought I showed disrespect for Helen , marrying five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl . Anyway , I do n't consider myself really married to her . Helen 's still my wife . Do n't tell Lettie that , not that she do n't know it . She 's forbiddenme to mention Helen 's name in the house . Helen 's house ! How do you like that ! She even gets mad as hell when we go into town and I look over at Helen 's grave . " " Could n't you have found someone else ? " " An old goat like me ? Now in your case it 's different . Hell , if I 'd been your age , you think I 'd have settled for Lettie ? And if I had n't had the girl . . . " He considered the house for a moment . " My great-grandfather came over on a boat , and his wife died on the trip , and by the time he landed in New York , he was married again . ' Course , the trip took longer then . . . You do n't want I should cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . " Not until I go , Frank . " " Yup . Well , all right then . I know how you feel . After Helen passed away , everyone was baking me cakes , bringing in stews and things . I had to let them do it because of the girl . But I just wanted to sit and talk to Helen . " " Yeah , I guess that 's about it . " " That 's what I come down here for nights . Well , I 'll call you to see how you 're doing . " " I 'm not going to answer the phone , Frank . " " Well , then give a holler if you want me . " The telephone rang inside . We looked at each other and smiled . " I could never do that , sit listening to a phone ringing . Might be some feller wanted to give me some money . " " As a writer I 've done it all my life . " " When you decide to get out , take a drive over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's fixed up nice . "  | " I will , Frank . " He walked to his truck and opened the door , then called back , " I appreciated you coming to the funeral . " He got in the truck , pulled into the road and disappeared in the trees . I moved Marianne 's bicycle into the shed . A futile gesture . I was angry with Frank and ashamed at the same time . I rationalized that I was angry because he had intrudedon my widower 's right to privacy , and yet I knew that what really bothered me , and made me ashamed to be bothered , was that he might have found Marianne , might even now have put two and two together . I felt a quick flash of hatred for Marianne , and then a feeling of shame for that hatred . In the house , Marianne had n't moved . She was still lying on the couch , scrunched up , hiding . I was embarrassedat my dash out the door to prevent him from discoveringher , and embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is he gone ? " " Yes . Frank . Old man who takes care of the place . " She made a place for me on the couch , but I was too upset to sit down . " I 'm sorry . I suppose now it will be all over town that you 're here . " " I do n't think so . Frank 's a kind man . " I suddenly flushed at having hidden Marianne 's bicycle . It had been a reflex action . When she found it moved , she would know my real feelings , that in addition to not wanting to be disturbed , I did not want people to know she was here . She smiled a little-girl smile at me . " I was pretty good , was n't I ? " " What do you mean ? " " Hiding . "  | " Yes . " I sat down and touched her face . It was obvious that we were both upset at this feeling we had to hide , but she was carrying it off with humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was relieved . " He may have seen it . I moved it into the shed after he left . " I shook my head . After a few moments she looked very serious . " Maybe I 'd better stop coming down . " " No . " I drew her close to me . " It would be awful if I ended up hurting you , making you hate me . " " How could you ? " But she knew how she could . She could n't help but sense my preoccupation with this man and what he might mean . Something had been lost . She kissed me , as though to reassure me . Then , " I have to go . " " What time 's your call ? " " Ten-thirty . " I got up . " I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to get back today , or tonight for supper . It 's opening , you know , and there 's the inevitable beach party after with the apprentices , and . . . " She finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were giving me an inventory of her obligations to cover her retreat . " I understand . I 'll be here . " She shook her head , frowning at the idea . " I have my letters to write , and it 's clearing , so I 'll swim , and I 'll sleep . I 'm tired . I 'll be all right . " " May I call you ? I could use two rings . . . no , three rings , and you 'd know it was me . " I hesitated . She retreated . " We 'll think about it . " We kissed good-bye in the shed . She looked into my eyes intently , worried , as though she were trying to fathom what was going on inside me . She . held me more tightly than I had ever been held ; there was a sense of desperation in it , as though this might be the last time we kissed . I looked down at her . " Have a good day . I hope thep193show goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have them ? Down at the cove ? " " Yes . " The eyes still searching . " Have a good time . They 're fun . " They were fun becauseFran and I were together . Was Marianne together with someone ? I did n't ask . " I ca n't stand the thought of you here alone . " " It 's the only way I can see you . " She took a step towards me and hugged me again , pressing her head against my chest . " If you hear your phone ring three times . . . " " If you find a stone on your stairway . " She leaned away and looked at me , smiling . " You 're a funny man , Christopher Larsen . . . " And she turned and mounted her bike and headed up the road , her graceful long back straight as she stood to get more power.  |p194As  I turned back into the cottage , I was frightened by that sudden gut feeling of resentment towards Marianne . To resent someone I adored because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of my love , the public image . And somehow it all reflected not just on me but on Fran . I thought of an entry I had made in my notebooks some years ago , an idea for a story . A man alone , suffering a heart attack , a mild one from which he would have recovered , but sensing death , he had struggled up the stairs to his study to destroy some embarrassing or incriminating material , and was found dead with his desk drawer open and the material half torn in his hands . No wonder I hadp195made that note . I was capable of doing that if an image was threatened . What was the moment in my own life which had made me think of that idea ? I could n't remember . I did remember . A letter from Jean which was perfectlyinnocent except that it mentioned Fran 's illness , so that if she had found it , she would have known . Another entry . A man whose wife had died at home under questionable circumstances trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . And the proofs which would be most conventionally acceptable would be no proof at all . No sins of commission , only of omission . And why that entry ? I went into the living room . It should have all happened in Paris or Rome or London . The legend and the idyll could have been kept separate , and I not so aware of my hypocrisy . I looked at the letters on the table . If I wrote those now , there would be nothing for the afternoon . Besides , I somehow felt cheap , not the husband who could sit down and write feelingly about his wife and his marriage . There was so much to be done , but I did n't seem to want to do any of it . I looked at myself in the mirror . Pale , still pale . . . I could do that , lie in the sun on the beach . Get some color . Look a little less old . One minute Fran , the next , Marianne . I shook my head . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started taking off my shoes . And I began to notice things . The small antique silver candlestick , our " fucking light . " Very daring for Fran , who did not use words like that . Another version of the reading stand I had built so that she could read lying flat . I was comforted by the love I had put into that . It was as if I had imagined that if I made that just right , everything would be good again . The sense of triumphwhen she found she could use it and could stand being left alone . Small pathetic victories on the road to inevitabledefeat.  |p196None  of this had registered with me yesterday when I had dashed in to shower and change before going back to Marianne . Another of Fran 's " Should " lists on the table by her side of the bed . Strong , beautiful handwriting . She drew the same way . Costume sketches as suggestions for a designer . Stroke ! Stroke ! The same way she walked . I could always tell her firm step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , hesitant lines . And I ambled . And again , the shoes where I had thrown them in anger that last day . I could n't go through all these things . " When I go to the village finally , I must get boxes for them and store them away in the attic back home , for some later quieter time . " I put on my bathing trunks , still sandy from last summer , threw a sweater around my shoulders , and started down the beach . Perhaps I should be with people , talk to them . This constant introspection ! Had I thrown away the crutch of their consideration too soon ? I remembered when I had had an operation on my knee , and I had used crutches and then a cane , and people had been so helpful in getting taxis and holding open doors . The first day without the cane had been a shock , and I had gone back to the cane for a couple of days , and had finally kept it in the closet , saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on days when I need a little extra kindness . " I scuffed through the sand , the sun warming my back . Marianne and I could be together in a motel up the coast . We could meet someplace on the road , and I could put her bike in the station wagon , and . . . It would never work . I felt a certain shame in even thinking about it . It was not that kind of relationship . Why had she hugged me so desperately just now ? What did other men do ? How often I had asked thatp197question in my life ! And what did it matter ? It did . I knew nothing about my friends , how they managed the deeply personal parts of their lives , the really important parts . I had learned most of what I knew about men from women . Men talk to women , some women , some men , in the depths of intimacy or loneliness . And then women talk to men and tell them how other men feel , and that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a stone . Mariannewould like this one . Then a few yards further on , anotherone . Then when I saw a third , I discarded the first one , and suddenly I found myself zigzagging down and along the beach , bending over , examining , comparing , eager to show my cache to Marianne . " Look what I found for you ! " " Look what I brought you ! " " Look whatI wrote you ! " " Look what I made for you , did foryou ! " I found a sheltered spot and lay down . I was going to strip off my trunks , but then I remembered Fran 's saying it was " sexy " to have that part white and the rest tan . " Focusedattention , like long black silk stockings on a woman are sexier than bare legs . " Thinking of our two small trianglesof white flesh and dark hair made me excited , and I shook my head . Does n't a person still live if the thought of her body can excite you ? The excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stones . The smooth and rounded stones were warm and oddly sensuous in my hand . I put one against my chest . I would rest it on her belly . I put it on my belly , then slipped it inside my trunks and felt its smooth warmth against me and was excited again with thoughts of Marianne . The warm , smooth stone was Marianne , and I enjoyed the sensation , and smiled at my easy and spontaneous reaction . " I want . I want . " This part of me was going to lead me back to life , was going to insist on living.  |p198I  lay there drowsy in the sun , when I thought , " What if she should call ? I wo n't hear the phone . " I sat upright . " But what difference does it make ? I 'm not going to answer it . " But not to hear it ! It suddenly seemed terribly importantfor me to hear the phone . I ran down to the water and dashed in and floundered around for a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried back to the cottage , listening as I got closer . When I reached the deck and stretched out in the sun , the phone rang , but it was not Marianne 's signal . Who was trying to reach me ? David ? I suppose I should not be cut off from my son . But he was not alone . But in case he needs me , I must let someone know I am here . Roger , my lawyer . After a late lunch , I napped again , giving up the hope that Marianne would call . Why should she call ? Had n't I given the impression that her presence here troubled me ? Later I drew the curtains in the living room , lighted the lamps on my desk , and was able to write some more letters , stressing perhaps more than usual how important Fran had been in my life , how dear she had been . The phone rang . I stopped in the middle of a word to count . One , two , three . It stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three . Without thinking , I reached out and picked it up , just raised it from the bar and held it there , listening to hear if Marianne would say anything . Nothing . I hung up . I wondered where she was . At the theatre ? A phone booth near the post office ? Eight o'clock . Probably at the theatre . I had n't asked her if she was on the crew or if she was just going to watch the opening . The mood of the letters was broken . I got up and went into the kitchen and poured myself a drink , suddenly feeling trapped in my cottage . What was there for dinner ? My old stand-bys  --  hash , tuna fish , frankfurters , soups , let/tuce , tomatoes , bread , jelly , milk . I 'd lived on these for weeks sometimes when Fran had been away . I started to open the hash , then stopped . I wanted to get out . I could drive twenty miles or so up the shore to some joint where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shopping center where I 'd never shopped , and call Roger . Just get out !  |p200For  a while I just drove around , enjoying the eveningafterglow and the exhilaration of being out . When it was dark , I returned to the Coast Road and stopped at a place that was new since last summer . BAR AND GRILL , CLAMS , LOBSTERS . There was no counter . The owner , in shirt sleeves , showed me to a booth . " Arc you alone ? " " Yes . " They hate wasting a booth on loners , but it was late and the place was almost empty . I looked around . In the coldly lighted room the fewpeople looked like corpses . I was the only person alone . I ordered my drink from a beefy waitress and sat therelooking around . I should have brought a newspaper orp201magazine . I was an old enough hand at eating alone to know that . " Do you by any chance have a newspaper ? " " You can get one over in the shopping center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one now . But thank you . " As she turned away I remembered I was going to call Roger . " Is there a public phone ? " " By the rest room . " " Roger , this is Chris . Sorry to call you at home . " " Where the hell are you ? " " I 'm at the cottage on the Cape . " " I 've been trying you there . " " I know you have . " " How do you know I have ? " " I 've heard the phone ringing . " " Why did n't you answer ? " " I did n't want to . I came up here to be alone . I have a lot of friends up here and I did n't want to be in touch with them all , yet . " " I understand . How are you feeling ? " " Pretty good . " " How long you going to stay there ? " " I do n't know . " " I 'm not sure it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm okay . Do n't tell anyone I 'm here , please , except David , if he calls . Has he called ? " " No . Some people have called , wanting to start some kind of fund in Fran 's memory . But listen , all that can wait . The important thing is , how are you ? " " I 'm okay . " What would Roger think about Marianne ? It was almost unfair to accept his concern based on the assumption that I was up here going through " cold turkey . " We had all been at college together and he had been very fond of Fran . " Look , we 've got to get together with the Revenuep202man and open Fran 's safety-deposit box . It 's holding things up . " " There 's the one in Boston too . Ca n't I send you the New York key with authorization ? You 're co-executor , and you and he can go down and see what 's there . " " I 'd rather you be there . You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I do n't know about the Revenue man , but you 'll keep him honest too . " As I returned to my booth , the waitress put the seafoodsalad in front of me . I ordered a beer and picked up my fork . " Music I heard with you was more than music . " Conrad Aiken 's line . Food I ate with you was more than food , and food I now eat alone is almost disgusting . I took out my wallet , and while I picked at my food , started going through my cards and receipts and licenses and all the bits and pieces of paper I had stuck in there over the last months . The waitress brought the beer and looked at me as I sorted things out . " We do n't accept credit cards here . " " No . No . I understand . " I spent a few minutes trying to figure out what a salesgirlhad written on a charge slip at Bloomingdale 's . Whateverit was , it had cost $25.67 . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bonwit charge card . Bergdorf 's . All Fran 's which I had had to use the last year , shopping for her . I 'd keep these cards . A cleaning ticket . What was that ? God , I had n't been through this stuff in months . The safety-deposit-box key wrapped in tissue paper , which I would send Roger . Another one for Boston . I scooped up the scraps and put them in my pocket to discard in a more private place . I felt the small stone I had found for Marianne and cradled it , warming it , missing her . I took another mouthful and a swig of beer and looked across at the shopping center . Lots of jalopies over there , with boys leaning against them , smoking , talking.  |p203Then  I saw a boy and his girl standing in the shadow of a car . He had her pressed up against the car with his hips , and he was kissing her and rubbing against her , and she was laughing . I almost retched . I closed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold and be held . My God , did n't this ever stop ? The instinct to touch , to hold . Brokenand exhausted men during the war . . . my blind old grandmother when I was young , reaching out and groping , " Chrissie , where are you ? " and just holding my hand and nodding and smiling . . . in my own loneliness , as a boy , holding myself , my hands clutched between my legs . " Is there something wrong with the salad ? " I opened my eyes . " No . " I looked out at the boy and girl again . From somewhere I remembered " To live alone a man has to be more than human or less than human . " I looked at my watch . Ten-thirty . There was no way I could see Marianne tonight . The play would be over in a few minutes . Then the beach party and all the young people , sitting on blankets , lying on blankets , wrapped in blankets . I had a terrible need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant to me . Each desolate moment of loneliness was making her meaning more clear and urgent . If I could n't be with her , I could write to her , achieve a closeness by writing of my need , and love , and devotion . On a couple of pieces of paper which the waitress reluctantlyfound for me , I started to write in a frenzy of longing . " Dear Marianne . . . " And I said everything I was feeling , all the words , reckless , impassioned , tumbling on top of each other , " saved " . . . " never before " . . . " adore " . . . " never so needful , never so happy . " I finished the letter , deeply and passionately in love with Marianne . I was exhilarated , feeling a very pure and direct and honest feeling which I had expressed without reservation . There was something joyous in just doing that . I sat back , excited , anxious to deliver the letter , top204have her read it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholeheartedness of it , the absence of checks and balances . I paid my bill , left much too large a tip , which I hoped would embarrass the waitress ( but I knew it would n't ) , and walked across to the shopping center and bought a package of envelopes in the news and stationery store and got in my car . The lovers pressed against the car did not make me feel lonely this time . I smiled at them , and the girl waved and smiled . I sat in the car for a moment . I could n't be with Marianneeven if she wanted me . Which I was n't sure . She would be at the beach party . How close could I get to her ? As a young man I had sat in front of girls ' houses just to be close to them when they were n't able to be with me . I had watched lighted windows far into the night . What was the good of it ? The good of it was that it was obeying an instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to tell her next time I saw her that I had . . . What ? Oddly enough it was Fran 's voice I heard saying " If you have an impulse to do something , do it . " Eleven o'clock . I started the car and headed for the cove and the beach party.  |p205As  I neared the bluff overlooking the cove and the beach , I looked down to see the fire and the shadowy figures huddled together in pairs or scampering in and out of the light . I had said that I wanted to see Marianne functionin her world , but now I did not want to . I turned back away from the coast road . Quarter to one . The town usually insisted these parties break up at one . They broke up officially , then couples wandered off down the beach or into cars . Who had brought Marianne ? It was impossible that there was n't some boy , or many boys . Usually by this time in the summer there had been pairing-off . Also , young leading men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrespon/sible , would dabble among the younger and prettier apprenticeswho might be flattered by the attentions of a professional actor . I suddenly felt like a father . I knew all the pitfalls my daughter must avoid , all the ruses of young men . I drove back towards the village . I would leave the letterand the stone on her stairs . As I approached the barn , I visualized Marianne 's room and had an overwhelming impulse to be there , not just to leave the stone and the letter on the steps , but to be in that room , in her world , taken care of by her . There was no light in her room . Her bicycle was not in the rack . Not allowing myself to think , I drove two houses beyond the barn and turned into a long driveway and drove behind the house and pulled into a parking area in front of garage doors . I turned off the lights and sat quietly , listening . Dorothy and Ben were abroad . They had written that if I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the cottage , nobody would be there in July . The key was behind the deserted wasp 's nest on the back porch . I did n't want their house . I just wanted someplacedark to park the car off the street . I opened the car door , but did n't close it completely , and started off across the back lawns and gardens like a burglar . I shut off my mind . I knew what I was going to do , what I must do , and if I were discovered , well , I still had to do it . With my heart pounding , I climbed the stairs two at a time . Only as I reached the top step and looked at the door did it occur to me that it might be locked . People were beginning to lock doors now , even in a village like this . It was n't locked . I opened it quickly and went inside and closed the door and listened . No sounds . I turned and looked at the room in the glow cast by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran had had it as an apprenticep207while she was still in college , and we had had it our only year down here as a married couple . She had been a regularmember of the company then , and I commuted to Bostontwice a week to teach in summer school . A car drove by slowly , and I felt like a thief . I looked out the window but I could n't see who it was . I moved away from the window and approached the double bed and sat on it . One o'clock . She should be getting back soon . Should n't I give her some warning ? How ? What if she did have a boy and he did come up here with her ? I could n't possibly get out if they started up the steps . What the hell was I doing here ? I 'd only wanted to come to her , to be with her , to make a committing gesture , but it might cause her embarrassment , and if not embarrassment , it was forcingthe situation . What was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . I heard a car come down the street and I rose so that I could see it as it passed . It was the constable 's car . Sad old man . Nothing ever happened in the town , but some years ago his wife had run off and left him , and since then he had taken to patrolling the streets late into the night . I felt Marianne 's stone in my pocket . I went to the table and there was the stone I had left the night before . I could put these on the steps . That would n't tell her I was inside . I could leave a note under one of them . But what kind of note that would n't cause trouble if the boy were to pick it up first ? I sat at the table and thought about it . FinallyI found some note paper and wrote in large letters which she could read by the light from the streetlight . I AM INSIDE ! ! In looking for an envelope , I saw some lettersaddressed to her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even asked her where she lived . Were these from home , or someone else ? I put my note in an envelope , sealed it , and wrote in block print ( which might be Mrs. Grader 's writing ) , IM/PORTANT MESSAGE FOR YOU . . . OPEN AT ONCE ! I opened the door and put one stone on one step , and the new stone on the next to top one with the envelopeunder it , and quickly withdrew into the room . The whole thing was becoming complicated . I lay on the bed and waited . I had surprised Fran once , and it had turned into a fiasco . Corning hack from a shakedown cruise during the war , the day before the ship was due in Philadelphia for repair and overhaul , it had put in at Annapolis so that the midshipmen could take a look at it . I left the ship at Annapolis with the idea of getting up to Philadelphia by train , surprising Fran and spending a few hours in bed with her , and getting back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started trying to reach her the moment I left the ship , but all I could find out from my parents , with whom she had been visiting , was that she had left the house and was presumably on her way to Philadelphia . I arrived in Philadelphia full of the excitement of my own effort , found out she had not arrived at the apartment hotel where we were going to stay , and proceeded to sit in the station and meet every train from New York . It was madness . By the time she finally arrived at one o'clock in the morning , I loathed her , and the whole reunion was a shambles , and at four o'clock I had headed for Annapolis and the ship with very little desire to sail back up to Philadelphia . Ridiculous ! We had laughed over it many times . I looked across at the single bed near the window , where Fran 's roommate had been the first few weeks of that first year . She had conveniently left in a huff when she was n't promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had been able to come up and spend some nights . ( There was a Mr. Grader in those days , and Mrs. Grader had slept more soundly . ) And later , the summer we lived here legitimately , the single bed had been a kind of escape when I 'd feel stifledp209sometimes by Fran 's closeness . How long it had taken me to get used to this closeness , to cherish it and crave it ! It had almost been as though I had had to preserve some privacy , some secret part of myself that preferred to be alone . How long , in our courting days , before Fran had been able to coax me into spending the whole night . I had loved being with her , sleeping that lovely " afterwards sleep . " But then I sometimes had wanted to go back to my room in the middle of the night . There was some final commitmentinvolved in spending the night . Possibly some hint of domesticity that frightened the young lover . Or maybe just that instinct for detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter I had written in the restaurant . I jumped up and took it from my shirt pocket and propped it up on her desk and lay down again . And began to have misgivings . I was coming on pretty strong in the letter . It could easily frighten her , scare her away . In a sense , I was laying my life at her feet . It had excitedme to write the words , to feel so committed . But did I really mean it , or did I just long to mean it ? A car came down the street . I held my breath and listened . It stopped in front of the barn . The motor was idling . If it was switched off . . . It was switched off . I broke into a cold sweat waiting for the next sound , the sound of doors opening and closing . It did n't come . They were sitting there . I lay there looking at the ceiling , and suddenly I got a picture of myself , and I was ashamed and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have escaped . I was not a romantic young apprentice having a lark lying there waiting for my girl , I was a middle-aged man , a recent widower , waiting for a girl half my age to whom I had awarded a prize which I had established to memorialize a wife whom I presumably adored . I got up and took the letter from the table and shoved it in my pocket.  |p210The  car door opened . A mumble of voices . A " Shhhh . " Then a moment . A last kiss ? The door closed , the car started and after a moment pulled away quietly . I started breathing again . I went to the window and watched her pick up the first stone and then the second stone and open the envelope . She looked up quickly towards the door . Instinctively she glanced around as she came up the last two steps . She opened the screen door and I opened the inside door . She stepped in quickly and closed the door and then in an intense whisper , said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she was smiling . " I know . I just had to be near you . " And I put my arms around her She was still holding the stones and the note . " My God ! " She let me kiss her , then moved her mouth away . " How did you get up here without anyone seeing you ? " " Sheer genius . " " Shhhh . Where 's your car ? " " I parked it back of a friend 's house down the street . He 's away . I snuck through gardens and hedges . " She moved away to put the stones down , looked at me , shaking her head , and then came to me and put her arms around my neck and hugged me . " I was suddenly so lonely for you . " " Then it 's good you came . " And she kissed me . " But I get so nervous . " She looked out towards the street . I had a sudden wild thought that perhaps the boy in the car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I said , " This day and age , is anybody shocked at a man in a girl 's room ? " " In this town they are . It 's fantastic . It 's causing a lot of trouble with the apprentices . They 're used to pairing up in college , but down here . . . boys in one house , girls in another . "  | " I hate to disillusion you , but even back in my day , boys managed to find their ways into girls ' rooms . It 's been going on for centuries . " " Well , you 'll never believe it , but a boy and a girl were sent home . " " I believe it . Mackenzie has always had to be careful not to outrage the locals . I think it 's mostly that it 's in their houses that it 's going on that bothers them . " All the time I was pressing her to me , moving my hands over her body . I moved us towards the bed and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go in a minute . " She pressed my head to her cheek . " It 's absolutely silly . But somehow I 'm nervous , worried . For you , too , you know ? " She moved away and looked at me , reminding me of my reaction to Frank . " I thought of all that , but I was having dinner in some dreary joint up the beach , and I saw a boy and girl kissing and holding each other , and I just forgot everything and had to come to you . " She leaned over and kissed me . " I sound so selfish . " But there was no easing of her tension . Her lips were on mine , but her eyes were " listening . " I was tense too . We had managed to get together , to make the statement after the chill of the morning , and now both of us were more concerned with my getting out unnoticed than with anything else . I got up . " I 'll go . " A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I wanted to bring you this stone . It was warm from the sun when I picked it up . Knowing that I was going to bring it to you , that it had already become yours , you , I kept it warm down here . " " Oh , my poor friend . " A car passed slowly . She stood up . We both looked towards the window . " I 'll go . " " All right . I 'm sorry . "  | " I just had to come . Selfish . " " No . " She held me . " Did you hear my phone call ? " She smiled like a delighted child . " Yes . Thanks . I picked up the phone . " " You did ? I did n't hear you . Did you say anything ? " " It was after the third ring . " " I must have hung up . " " I did n't say anything . I just wanted you to know I had heard it . " She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot something . I bought you a present . I was shopping for props this afternoon , and look ! " She held out a false nose with a big mustache attached . " What 's this ? " " A disguise for you . So you can wander around town and nobody will know you . Put it on . " I slipped it on . She was tickled . " Wonderful . " She kissed me again . " I never kissed a man with a mustache before . Shall I come down tomorrow ? " " Please ! " " But not in the morning . I 've got a part , a very nice part . I just found out this afternoon . I 've been planning how I 'd tell you , and with all this , it just went out of my head . " " Congratulations . " I hugged her . " We rehearse in the morning , but I 'll be down later , and since I 'm in the show , I do n't have to come to the theatre at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So . . . " " Lovely . " I took off the nose and mustache and held her one last time tightly , in anticipation of those nights , pressing into her . " Good night . " " Good night , " she whispered in my ear . I released her and moved towards the door . " You know , this part of it , the escape , is all rather undignified . To preserve the romantic atmosphere , perhaps you shouldp213go into the bathroom and only come out when I 've made my departure . " She giggled and put her hands over her mouth . " I 'm going to watch . " " Very awkward for a middle-aged man . " " Why do you keep saying that ? " " Because it 's true . " I put my hand on the doorknob . " Stand back in case there 's shooting . " She doubled over in silent laughter . I opened the insidedoor and listened . Then the screen door . It used to squeak . Someone had oiled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now there was nothing to do but just to go and trust to luck . I went quickly down the stairs , and back to my car through the lawns and gardens . As I opened the car door , I looked back at Marianne 's room and saw the light go on . I did not close the car door , but started the car , and holding the door with one hand , went out the drive and into the street . At the end of the block I slammed the door and drove off , feeling giddy , daring , and very much alive.  |p214The  next afternoon David and Gretchen arrived from Boston . I had been having a fine day . I had gone to sleep the night before , still shaking my head over my impulsive adolescent " occupation " of Marianne 's room . When I had graduated from prep school , the headmaster had said to us all , " My fondest wish is that while you develop the minds of men , you will retain the hearts of boys . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes . I had slept late , awakened around nine-thirty by Marianne'sring ( she must be about to go to rehearsals ) . I had done everything with the knowledge that Marianne would be there later.  |p215I  cleaned up the kitchen , removed the winter 's mouse droppings from the backs of cupboards , scrubbed them with ammonia , and made a marketing list for a party dinner . I ran a mop around the floors and put fresh linen on the bed in my study , after airing it in the sun . Early afternoon I sunned myself , swam naked in the ocean , now enjoying the play of water over my body , " our " body , " our " friend . My body had taken on a whole new meaning now that it was shared with someone , alive to another person . I noted the slight color which had started everywhere but the pubic triangle . I found a few new stones for Marianne , and around two-thirty I dressed and drove away with my shopping list to a distant town . Joy infused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine or white ? What kind of vegetables ? Cheeses ? " At the fruit section I saw oranges . Would she be there for breakfast ? Did I want her there for breakfast ? I bought the oranges , not quite sure . On the way back to the cottage , with the rear of the station wagon loaded with provisions , I picked up some geraniums . Then I found the gate open . I entered the drive and got out and closed the gate . As I reached the end of the wooded drive , I could n't see a car . Then David came around the side of the house . I froze . My mind rushed ahead to Marianne 's arrival . All the things in the car . I stopped far short of the house to avoid his looking in the car , and got out . " David ! " He came towards me , and Gretchen appeared from around the house . As I approached him , I saw his MG pulled up alongside the shed . " David , this is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hi , Dad . " We shook hands . I had always kissed my father . I do n't think David had ever kissed me , or at least , I could n't remember . " Gretchen . " I kissed her cheek . She was wearing a T/shirt and jeans , no shoes . I was suddenly aware that my girl was the same age as my son 's girl . " We tried to call down here to see if anyone was here , but we never got an answer . " " I 've been hiding out . " I moved them towards the house . " How long have you been here ? " " About fifteen minutes . We could n't be sure if you were here . It looked that way , but we were n't sure . " " Well , this is very nice . Have you shown Gretchen the house ? " " Yes , but mostly the beach . " I must have had a glassy look on my face , completely phony . My mind was racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I was talking , I was trying to think what I 'd say if I reached her . What kind of messagecould I leave ? How would she feel about being asked not to come down ? I suddenly felt angry that she was coming . Angry with David for busting in . Angry with myself for being angry . " Why do n't you and Gretchen go in for a swim ? " If I could get them away from the house , I could call the theatre . " Actually , Dad , we 're on our way further down the Cape . . . to visit friends . " I was relieved but also annoyed at what I was sure was a lie . They had taken a chance to come down here for the night , but finding me , David had gone through that instant withdrawal . My feelings were corroborated by Gretchen 's quick look at David . " We could take a quick clip . " David was firm . " We promised them we 'd get there to swim with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brusque treatment of me . She and I had always gotten on very well . " Well , at least I 'd like to look around a little more . I 've heard so much about this place . " I could excuse myself to go to the bathroom and shutp217the bedroom door and try to call . The phone rang . It was not Marianne 's ring . " I could never stand not answering a phone , " Gretchen said . " I 've wanted to be alone for a while . Get caught up with myself . I was pretty much overwhelmed by friends back home . Nobody knows I 'm here . I have n't been to the theatre , and I go to great lengths to stay out of the village , shop several towns down , where I 'm not known . " I almost broke into a sweat at what I was saying . How would it all sound if Marianne were to arrive ? " Would you excuse me for a second while I go to the john , and then I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phony exit lines , but it all just kept coming , and each thing I said sounded worse than the last . " David , show Gretchen the shed , where you used to camp out . David established his independence very early . " I tried to smile , and went into our bedroom as David and Gretchen sauntered around the side of the house . I called the theatre . Who would answer ? It was the girl at the box office . Disguising my voice very little , I asked for Marianne . She would send someone to see if she was still rehearsing . Before she came back on the phone , I heard Marianne 's bicycle bell announcing her arrival . I hung up . I did n't want to go out there . I did n't know what to say . I was tired of the little half-truths , all self-serving . What would Marianne say ? Let her say it before I came out . But how would I know what she had said , to match stories ? I could n't stand the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the living room and towards the back door . As I went , I could see Marianne standing there , still holding her bicycle , shaking hands with David and Gretchen and saying something . The first thing I noticed was that she had my sweater knotted around her neck . It was a fairly common sweater . David probably would n't recognize it.  |p218I  tried to learn something from watching David 's reaction . Gretchen was smiling and chatting with a girl her own age . David was n't smiling . He was just standing there looking at Marianne . I went out the back door , calling a hearty but ambiguous " Hello . " Marianne sang out , " The others ca n't come swimmingtoday . Mac 's got them scrubbing flats and doing all sorts of dirty chores . I think he suddenly got the idea the apprentices are having it too easy . I 'm privileged , since I 'm rehearsing . " She said the last like a grand lady . How beautifullyshe 'd brought it off ! " You 've met , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Relieved , I babbled on . " I 've been trying to persuade them to stay for a swim , " now actually eager that they should stay to normalize the situation . " We 've got to be getting on . " David was unrelenting . I wondered if Marianne had had time to say that she had Fran 's scholarship , and if this would make things worse . I decided not to mention it . I became overeager . " Why do n't you reconsider and stay on overnight ? You know it 's going to be too late to swim when you get wherever you 're going . Where did you say it was ? " There was something small in my " calling " what I considered David 's lie . " Truro , " David said , and I could tell he was annoyed that Gretchen had looked at him with a frown , as though I had caught him out . Marianne said , " I 'll go get my swim , because I 've got to get back . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I do n't see you again , it 's nice to have met you . " David mumbled something , but Gretchen called out " Yes ! " and fluttered her hand in a wave . " There are plenty of beds , you know . I 've been sleeping in the study , but you and Gretchen could . . . "  | " No . We 're expected down there . I just wanted to drop in and show Gretchen the cottage . " His awkward , somewhat spastic jerking motions with his arms and body always let me know when David was under tension . As a boy it had been a certain repeated hunching of the shouldersbefore he said something difficult . " Well , how about stopping on the way back , tomorrowor whenever you 're coming back ? " " We 'll be getting right back . Gretchen 's got classes . . . " " I could cut that one . " David was again annoyed with her for not playing the game . " Well , I want to get back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may not stay here very long . But you know where the key is and how to turn things on . " David 's hands were jammed into the back pockets of his jeans . " Yeah . Thanks . " I looked at him a moment . " How are you ? " He ducked and dodged . " I 'm fine . " " Good . " I smiled at Gretchen and put my arm around her . " Taking good care of him ? " I could see that David was uncomfortable at my touching her , and somehowit was different for me this time too . I had not been a father who had secret longings for my son 's girls . There was a natural barrier which I understood and accepted . Was it because my mother had once said about a fortyfive-year-oldman in our town who was chasing a girl of twenty , " What does he think a young girl would see in an old goat like him ? " I had accepted this attitude as valid and had not allowed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be acceptable . David had turned away from the spectacle of my touching Gretchen and was moving towards the car . Out of consideration for his feelings , I omitted kissingp220Gretchen good-bye , but she reached up and kissed me and put her arm around my waist . " How are you ? " " I 'm okay . " " I ca n't see how you stand it down here . " " Well . . . " I looked at David . I thought I saw a trace of a smile as he stood with the car door open . " You know David and I could clean this place out for you , pack things away . . . " " Thanks . It 's really something only I can do . " " Come see us in Boston if it gets too grim . " She gave me a last peck on the cheek and got in the car . David and I looked at each other across the top of the car . " Thanks for dropping by . I still wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the top of the car , and we shook hands . He was in a hurry to get out of the situation . He started the car , wheeled it around expertly , and headed for the drive . Gretchen waved out the window , but I noticed as they drove past my station wagon , David cast a long look at the boxes and bags and pots of flowers . " Close the gate ! " I called . But they did n't hear.  |p221When  they had disappeared into the trees , I drove the station wagon nearer to the house and just sat there for a moment . I could imagine the conversation in the car . Gretchen : " Why did n't we stay ? " David : " Oh , come on , Gretchen , could n't you tell what was going on ? " How did Marianne feel ? I had n't denied her , just not acknowledged her . I left the provisions in the kitchen and went down the beach to where she was sitting , hugging her knees and staring at the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with her " public " face , but then seeing me alone , she smiled wanly . I moved quickly to her and held her tightly , wishing that this gesture could handle all thep222words that should be said . An essentially verbal man , but always so eager to communicate by simpler and more ambiguoustouching . She looked at me with a little bright smile . " Were you proud of me ? " I hugged her . " I did well , did n't I ? " " Yes . And I did very poorly . " " How ? " " I should have said , I 'd like you to meet Marianne , whom I love . ' " She looked quickly at me , a small frown . I had not known what I was going to say . I kissed her . " That would have been very silly , even if true . Anyway , I had already said my little piece about the others . " " You 're a very good actress . I was a complete coward , more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard your bicycle bell . I saw you coming towards them , and I just stood there and said , Let her handle it . ' " She looked at me . " Do you think he knew ? " " I do n't know . " " It 's all very confusing . I 've been trying to project myselfoutside the situation . But I ca n't . I 'm in the situation , and it all seems so right . " " My father used to say , Whenever you wonder whether or not you should do something , always imagine what it would look like in headlines on page three of the Daily News . ' " " Good Lord ! " She stroked my hand for a moment . " How are things between you and him ? I mean David . " " As complex , I suppose , as they are between most fathersand sons . He adored his mother . He did n't see muchof her because she was often away , on tour , making films . But he adored her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nanny , of course , after we could affordone . Fran was more like some lovely indulgent aunt whofloated in with love and presents . She used to say , It 's notthe quantity of time you spend with a person , it 's the qual/ity of the time . ' And Fran gave full quality to every second . . . I 'm sure he finds me guilty of many wrongs , some I 'm not even remotely aware of . I do n't know . We 've just never been very close . Nothing specific . I accept my part of the blame , whatever it is . " I kissed her cheek and rubbed my face against hers . I returned to the more immediate issue . " Of course , when I was his age , I could n't imagine a man of forty-three being in love . Men of forty-three were businessmen , heads of families , golfers , poker players , drinkers . And as for a young girl having anything to do with one of them . . . " She just smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot what he thinks . " " Yes , I suppose so . One always wants to be under-stood . " " If you could make him understand , what would you want him to understand ? " She looked at me . I thought for a few moments , then smiled . " I do n't know . " " Sometimes I would be horrified if people understoodme . " She shook her head . " It bothers you what other people think too , does n't it ? " " Does n't it bother you ? " " Oh , very much . But in this , with Fran , you know how it was , do n't you ? At the theatre they talk to me a lot about Fran and you , because they think having the scholarshipI should know . And my God , it 's . . . well , you know . " " I told you the survivor is always the sinner . Death puts a person beyond reproach . De mortuis nihil nisi bonum . Which leaves the survivor with some almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was everything ' ? " " Oh . . . petty , trivial cruelties . " " Oh , well . . . " She shrugged . I was being forgiven , which is what I wanted , but Ip224felt dishonest . I felt there was some more major charge I was n't mentioning , did n't know myself , wanted to discover . " It sounds very ruthless , I mean , you with yourself . I somehow have a feeling that God is more forgiving than you are . I smiled . " Perhaps He does n't know as much about me as I know about myself . " " You want to know definitely , finally , without questionthat you loved Fran and that you were a good hus-band . " " Yes , I guess that 's it . " It was too simple , but it was as far as we were going to get . She looked at me , took my hand , and then said very formally , " Then I tell you just that . Go and sin no more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she kissed me , laughing . We lay there in each other 's arms for a while , kissing , nibbling . The sun was going down behind us . " You know , I do n't know anything about you . I know some of your attitudesand opinions , but nothing about where they came from . " " There 's not a great deal to know that I want to talk about . My ideas on marriage were formed very early , specifically , at birth . I never saw my father . Oh , I 've seen picturesof him , all I could get my hands on . Very handsome . Good family , whatever that is . My mother was just a pretty girl in the town , poor family . My mother tells me that there was a marriage and a quick divorce , and some money changed hands . She never married again . She has a very low opinion of men . She 's a physical-culture nut . Used to hail me into her room periodically to show me how well she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . A rather dull woman , I 'm sorry to say . Her interests do n't seem to extend beyond her body , a neat house and television . Sometimes I 'm very sympathetic to my father . "  | " Did she come for graduation ? " " No . She came once to see me act , and she felt so uncomfortable with the other mothers and fathers , she 's always made up some excuse since then . Miss A has been more of a mother to me . " " Do you know where your father is ? " " No . He turned into a bit of a hermit , I understand . Strangely , I do n't feel much bitterness towards him . My mother used to go on and on about how horrible he was , but since I could n't stand her , I instinctively got very defensiveabout him . His image has been very important to me . A man who could n't stand the mediocrity of my mother 's mind and attitudes . . . I fantasize that he 's somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great body of important work , and one day . . . one day he 'll show up at a stage door where I 'm playing , and . . . " " And what will you do ? " She did n't answer . I looked down and saw that she was pressing her lips together very tightly and she was frowning to hold back tears . Then suddenly she turned her face into my neck and cried . I just held her and stroked her head . " I 'm sorry . It 's very sloppy . I ca n't stand sloppy people . " She dug in my trousers ' pocket for a handkerchief . " You do n't need my troubles . " She blew her nose . " I 'll wash it and bring it back . " She sat away from me , looking at me , her eyes blinking with tears and trying to smile . " I do n't cry very often . I really do n't feel that strongly about my father . It was just . . . today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the damned curse . " I reached out and brushed back her hair . " I like girls who cry . " " Why ? " " It 's very trusting . " She smiled . " I 'm feeling a little cold . Can we go in-side ? "  |p226We  had dinner in the kitchen  --  candles , checkeredtablecloth , wine . " I 'm afraid I 'm not a very good cook . " She was n't . I kept reaching over to touch her face , getting up to crouch beside her and rub my head against her . She kept eating and enjoying her food and laughing at my need to be close to her . " Do you do this all the time when you 're married ? " She fed me a mouthful . I smiled . " No . I come from a very affectionate family . Though you might not think it from what I 've said about him , my father was a tender man . He did n't want us to have animals in the family . He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be done with another member of the family . "  |p227She  laughed . " But what if you wanted cuddling and petting but at that particular moment loathed all the other members of the family ? " " My father 's theory was , I think , that if you needed the affection badly enough , the hunger would make you overcome your loathing . I think he was afraid that if no effort were made towards each other , we 'd all sooner or later just turn to the dog for easy and ready affection . " After dinner she wanted to tidy up , but I would n't let her . " It spoils the whole feeling dinner gives you . Come on , let 's lie down . " I headed towards the couch and the fire , but she guided me along to the bedroom we 'd used . " I feel this is more ours , all right ? " We did n't light a light . There was a half-moon over the water . We just lay down and held each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lay back . " I 've never spent a whole night with . . . anyone . " I kissed her neck , waiting , oddly enough still not sure if I wanted her to stay . " I feel more like it with you than I have with anyone else . . . but I 'm not going to . " Perhaps she expected me to try to persuade her . I only said , " I understand , " and kissed her chin . She did n't ask me what I understood , and I did n't ask her why she had n't spent the night before and would n't this time . Perhapsthere was something too married about it , too committed . She kissed me for " understanding , " and seemed somehow relieved . She went back to the subject of marriage . Miss A had told me , " This one is n't going to get married . " Her family history gave some reasons . She gave others . " I sense that I 'm too impulsive for marriage . " Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips with her finger . " For instance , if I 'd been married , I could n't have come here to you . And think what I would have missed ! " She kissed my forehead.  | " Because if I marry , which I wo n't , I 'd want to play by the rules . . . You did . " She rubbed her cheek against mine . " If you do n't want to play by the rules , do n't get married . " " The rules seem to change constantly . " " But I do n't think people can love each other very much if they do n't care if the other person sleeps around . . . if they 're married . It would seem to me to mean it was time to get out if I did n't care . " " I keep hearing that sex has been removed from the moral hierarchy . . . that it just is ' now , neither moral nor immoral . " She looked at me a moment . She snorted and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a new note in her voice . " What I want in this world is to devote my life to some one or some thing . Complete , whole . " Dedication . When I was a girl , I thought of becoming a nun . Their concentration and dedication excited me . I get the same feeling about some dancers , musicians , artists . To give up everything to do one thing well , and not make anyone else pay for that dedication . " I recognized the feeling , the intoxicating words . I stroked her hair . " You 're so loving and giving . You 'd miss that . " She raised herself and looked at me . " I could still love and give . . . but only as long as I wanted to . " She laughed at her selfishness , and then she looked serious . " And only as long as I was wanted and needed . " " I once started a poem with the line Some must leave and some be left . ' It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing this kills the exhilaration of his leaving , and he stays . " She shuddered , then lay her head on my chest again and was quiet . After a while her hand slid down to my erection , and she just left it there . Neither of us said anything . Then she brought her hand up to the tab andp229started to draw down the zipper . I put my hand down to stop her . " Hey ! " " What ? " She did n't move her hand . " I told you . " " Do n't you like it ? " " Yes , but not when I ca n't do anything for you . " " I would like to do something when you ca n't do anything for me . Consider it a gift . " " I just like holding you , touching you . There 's a differentquality to it . " " I like doing something for you when you ca n't do anything for me . There 's a quality to that too . " I could feel my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too . " Our friend down here would like to be selfish . What have you got against being selfish ? " " I just want you to know that it does n't always have to be . . . I enjoy just the tenderness and the feeling of your closeness . " " I understand that . " " I think you have some feeling that a man . . . that I have to be satisfied down there all the time . " " You 've made it clear that you do n't have to . . . last night . . . that you 're not demanding . I think you should be demanding . I would like it if you were . It would mean I could feel I could demand back . Does that scare you ? " Then I could tell that she was smiling . " If you wo n't demand , I will . I demand that you let me give you a gift . . . without obligation . " And she finished unzipping my trousers.  |p230Afterwards  , as we lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosscurrents . I had loved what she had done . Had always loved it . Did n't this tell me something about myself ? Why this extra rush of excitementwhen someone started doing that now . It had been my birthday , and we had been to the North Shore for a lobster dinner ( before we were married ) , and we had come back and almost before she had her coat off , she had pushed me on the bed . " I want to . I just want to . " I had wondered at her insistence . Was it something that she had had to prove to herself that she could do ? Shep231seemed so compulsive about it and a little awkward . In later months we had explored and experimented and made suggestions and discoveries . " I want my mouth on every part of you . " Marianne snuggled up to me , very pleased with herself . She had forced me to accept a gift and had fought off all efforts on my part to reciprocate . " You owe me . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She looked at me . " I already owe you so much . " She snuggled . " Oh , no . I was only teasing . I would like to do so much for you , get you deep in my debt , and then tear it all up in front of you and let you know you are free . " She nuzzled me . " I love your body . " " Very ordinary . It can be very disappointing on occasion . " " I do n't believe it . " I wanted to ask her about the boys , the men she 'd been with . Had n't any of them ever disappointed her . But I could n't ask . I ventured one question . " I was wondering . . . you did that so freely , with seeming enjoyment , yet when I wanted to . . . " I drifted off . " I know . " She hesitated a long time . Obviously it was difficult to talk about . I should n't have asked the question , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I ran my hand through her hair . " You have such beautiful  --  " "  --  There was this boy once . " She stopped , then went on . " And , I do n't know , but he 'd read everything , and he used me to . . . experiment on , and . . . " She turned and hid her face in the pillow . I turned and half covered her with my body and put my head down next to hers . I did n't want to know any more about it . I suddenly felt very protective , very angry at the insensitivity of the boy performing his mechanical experimentson this girl 's modest flesh . I suddenly felt veryp232possessive , almost sick to my stomach imagining anyone else touching her , being inside her . My mind went back to the evening with Fran , soon after we had started making love , when she had told me she had been with another boy before I came along . I had lain on the bed in the twilight of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welling from God knows what conditioning . I had the same feeling now , and though rationally I knew that Marianne would not have been there with me if she had n't had other lovers , I could n't reason away the primitive feeling . Whatever it was , it told me something more about my feelings for Marianne . With Sarah it had been amusing , even erotic , to hear her go on about her other men . With Marianne , I did n't want to know . She raised her head . " I 'm sorry . It 's really stupid of me . After all , it 's not the Middle Ages . A girl knows about these things . " " There 's a difference between knowing about . . . and knowing . . . It 's always the Middle Ages first times . And there are ways and ways . " I disliked myself for soundingso sententious , so understanding . It made me sound as though I not only knew all the answers , but also was alwaysgentle and considerate and effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marianne do her lines . She was a little shy at first , assuring me that she would just be saying the lines , not acting . " After all , you 've never seen me act . You may be wasting your money , you know . " But I could tell just from her mumbled readings that I was n't wasting my money . There was an intensity , a quality , a style . It made me stop the reading at the end of the scene and kiss her and look into her eyes with a new sense of who she was . This girl was going to be great . It was exciting . I have always been excited sexually and every other way by this kind of emerging greatness . There is somethingp233pure and beautiful about it . A person who knows what she can do and is going to go through hell to see that she does it . I have perhaps always been too oversensitive to this kind of " rightness " and completely intolerant of its absence . An insensitive reading of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful actress . It had happened so often . A first reading of a new play which I might be privileged to attend . I settle down and begin falling in love with the young actress sitting near Fran , but then three minutes after she has jumped into the reading with a complete lack of comprehension and sensitivity , I not only am not in love with her , I ca n't stand sitting in the same theatre with her . With Marianne the readings were all true . She had a great deal to learn , but her instincts were absolutely right . She grew more confident and asked me for suggestions . I raised both my hands in protest and said , " Never ! " She seemed surprised and wondered if Fran and I had n't talked over her parts . " Never ! Oh , we might have discussed them generally when she was offered a play , the character , but I never opened my mouth about a performance except to praise it . That is something for you and your director to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak your particular language , and you learn to understand his . " Watching this girl perched on Fran 's slipper chair by the fire , drilling herself on a scene she felt she had missed , I was tempted into all kind of fantasies , most of which involvedmy protecting her . A few hours ago , even just a few minutes ago , before she had started muttering the lines , she had been essentially what I had needed , a loving , comforting , responsive , beautiful presence . I had completely forgotten that other part of her , the reason she was here , the actress . It reminded me of one night with Fran , when she had happened to sit in on a talk I was having with ap234young writer about his work . She had sat in the corner sewingwhile we were talking , and when he had gone , she had looked at me with a new awareness and said , " You know , I 'd completely forgotten about that part of you , how your mind functions in your work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and tremendously exciting part of Marianne 's life . She was very special . Some instinct in me made me want to protect and nurture very special people . To serve . Was it some awareness of a kind of secondratequality in myself and my work ? I suddenly wanted to be part of her life as I had wanted to be part of Fran 's . " I think I know it now . " And she thrust the script at me.  |p235'knew  that returning to Boston for the first time would be difficult . Boston had been beginnings for Fran and me  --  meeting , courtship , marriage , first apartment , first book . But Roger had set up an appointment for me with a local lawyer so that we could go into Fran 's safetydepositbox with the Internal Revenue man . Marianne had said I should n't go so soon , but in a sense I was eager to finish touching all the painful spots and move on . Marianne would be opening Monday , and , and ... I had to smile at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been a matter of principle for Fran to have deposit boxes of her own . A very private per/son . When we had moved from Boston years before , she had kept her box there , for sentimental reasons , and she alwayspaid it a ceremonial visit on our trips back . I remembered how she had walked into the Chase Bank in New York when we arrived there , had taken one look around and said , " They do n't look like bankers to me . " Boston bankers looked like bankers . It was ridiculous , of course , to stay at the Ritz , where she had always stayed when she was on tour in Boston , and where we had earlier , as students and young marrieds , managed one or two meals a year . But it was " home " and to have avoided it would have defeated one of the purposesof the trip . I almost changed my mind when I smelled the perfume in the elevator and remembered how we had hunted high and low to discover where they hid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank I met the lawyer and the Revenue man , who did n't think my jokes about what we might find in Fran 's deposit box very funny . " Husbands and wives do n't always know the affairs of the others . I mean , of course , financial affairs . " As we went down to the vaults , I felt a certain eeriness about it . Fran was the most private person I had ever known , and now these two strangers were going to examinesome things which she had considered so private that she put them in a safety-deposit box . I secretly hoped there would be nothing . And yet , there might be something . I remembered a month or so after our marriage , while rummaging through a drawer looking for something Fran had phoned and asked me to find , I had come across a recently mailed letter with a return address from her father . I had been shocked , because she had always told me that her father was dead , killed some years before in an accident . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been angry that I had come across it , but finally told me that she had had a fierce fight with him , and that at thep237end of it he had said , " You may consider me dead . " And she had done just that . I signed the forms , handed over the key , and the three of us went into a small room , the Revenue man carrying the box almost as though he were shielding it from me . My hands and feet were cold . I realized I was nervous and angry at this invasion of privacy . The Revenue man opened the box with great ceremony . It was not empty . He lifted out an envelope . I recognized it at once , the letter I had written Fran on our wedding day . Before he could take it from the envelope , I reached for it , clearing my throat to say , " That 's . . . uh . . . very personal . A letter I wrote on our wedding day . " He proceeded to take out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have to look at everything . " " Why ? It 's obviously just a letter . " He shrugged . " Sometimes there 's information in lettersabout financial matters . " He proceeded to read the letter rather carefully . " Surely you can see , you can tell from the first page . . . " He read on . I looked at the lawyer for help . " I 'm sorry , but it 's regulations . However , these gentlemen are discreet . " I could damn well imagine how discreet they were . " You should have seen the letter I had today , this guy tellinghis bride how she excites him . . . " I could n't look at the man . He finished and handed it to the lawyer , looking at me with what I interpreted as slight distaste . I reached out and intercepted the letter . The lawyer smiled understandingly . " I really do n't have to look at anything , unless you want me to , or unless it concerns any property or any wish she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My head throbbed with anger and checked emotion . This small fluorescent room was suddenly a torture chamber . It all seemed an outrage . The things that one wants top238be most private become most public . I looked at the envelopeand my handwriting and started to remember , but there was no time . The Revenue man plucked out a pin and turned it over . The first pin I had given her , the first of many during our courtship . Small , silver . He examined it . I got angry . " Eight dollars and fifty cents . Silver . " He looked at me and set it next to the letter , and reached in again . Ah , a bankbook , small , blue . His interest perked up . " Our first savings account . " He riffled the pages , saw it marked " canceled " and with some disappointment set it in front of me . I began to look at the book , to remember , but there was no time to remember , to make contact with my feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was studying a filled-in form I could n't recognize . I frowned in concentration trying to remember it , annoyed that he was paying so much attention to something I could n't identify . He passed it over . It was the report of Fran 's fertility checkup years ago , when we had been unsuccessful in having a child , before David . The lawyer looked at me , curious , but I did n't say anything , just nodded my head . Starting to remember that sad-funny period of our life whenNow he was looking at what seemed to be Fran 's " Numbers , " and I smiled . Fran had been a great believer in numerology . Incredible ! A bright woman like that . Why should he study those scribbled pages so carefully ? Did people hide codes with directions to find secret treasures in such documents ? Finally he handed it over to me with no expression on his face . " That 's all . " " Then we have no problems . " The lawyer smiled . " We can have our release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling in and signing the forms . I looked at the last sheet of paper . The heading , CHART FOR CHRISTOPHER LARSEN . The date was severalp239months before we had been married . Fran had had me worked up by the numerologist to see what kind of husbandI would make . I smiled and shook my head . I wonder what kind of man she thought she was marrying . I put the papers in my jacket pocket and stood up . My head splitting , I thanked the lawyer and the Revenueman , signed some papers , and in a daze walked up the stairs and out of the bank . I walked down Boylston Street , past the bookshop where I had wasted far too many afternoons browsing after my writing or teaching while Fran was rehearsing . Past Shreves , where long before we were married we had come night after night to look at the silverware patterns displayedin the windows . Should it be Francis I or absolutely plain Contemporary ? Past Bickford 's , the all-night cafeteriawhere after rehearsals we had eaten late and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And that day had come . And I walked on , touching all bases . The Garden and the swan boats . A rainy winter day and a hitter fight in which each had wanted to run away from the other but we had only one umbrella , and Fran , refusing to take it , had dashed towards Boylston Street in tears . . . The Commons , skipping across the path in imitation of some dance step we 'd just seen in the new musical at the Shubert . . . Park Street station entrance where she had given me the signet ring I had wanted ( " I 'm embarrassed it 's only twelve carats " ) . . . The church where we were married , Fran chattering away nervously with the minister about the state of the world , perhaps trying not to think of what she was about to do . Scollay Square that was n't Scollay Square any more . ( " I want to see a burlesque show , a tassel-tosser . I justdo n't believe a woman can make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowled here too , after our marriage , lonely while Fran was rehearsing at night or teaching inp240the afternoon  --  had walked past the church where we had married and come here to prowl among the sleazy sailors ' bars , the burlesque houses and cheap hotels . Had only prowled . I walked on , up and over the back of Beacon Hill , down towards the river , and finally stopped in front of our first home , an old brick town house converted long ago into apartments . I looked at our windows . Just behind the glass curtains , an old lady was sitting holding a cat . It suddenlystruck me as odd that she had no idea of what used to go on there . It had been Fran 's small , cheerful apartment , and after we were married , I had simply moved in , had been absorbed into her life . But the difference . Whereas before I had been one of the acting groups invading her apartment ( the one who always stayed on ) , now writing , working , earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group and they were in our apartment , and they would n't go home . Fran had never wanted anyone to go home . I smiled as I remembered before we were married when after lovemakingI would finally put on my big overcoat . " Do n't go ! " And she would snuggle inside my coat , and I could almostbutton it around both of us . Then finally for the tenth time , " I must go . " Our happiest days , and also the first sadness and tears , and Fran so forthright , almost eager . " Have we made a mistake ? If we 've made a mistake , let 's admit it and break up . " The Valentine 's dinner , uneaten . . . Then suddenly I was tired . I had walked for hours , saying " Good-bye " to places , times , good and bad . I wanted to go back to my room now . I bought a bottle of gin in the liquor store on the corner of our street , and looked across at the flower shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower Fran would wear . White on the long black-velvet dressp241which moved so beautifully when we danced at the Copley Plaza on Friday nights . We did n't really drink in those days , except to use up our minimum at the Copley , and an occasional highball . We drank later , but not really until after the first operationwhen someone had sent us a case of Dubonnet , and then it became Dubonnet and gin , and then , for me , just gin . As I passed , I smiled and nodded at the lady who ran the flower shop , but she did n't recognize me . I was usually not recognized out of context , without Fran . I entered my room and thought I should call David . I should call friends . But I knew I would n't . I was too much with Fran and she too much with me . And I wanted it that way . I took off my coat and tie and opened the bottle of gin and propped myself up on the bed and stared at the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but I could not help myself . I had a feeling of being whole again , connected , of being back in the condition of my life , which was Fran , her death and my surviving . I had tried to shut her out too soon . Fran would not have approved of this . She never looked back . She would say " Good-bye " and turn and not look back , while I would be standing there waving , take a few steps and wave again . That 's what I was doing , of course , standing there waving , in the European way , with the palm up beckoning the departing person to come back . I looked at Fran 's fertility checkup and shook my head , smiling . Her tests . My tests , charts , temperatures , our efforts till we got to hate making love because it was all so calculated . But it became a point of pride . Our continuingefforts until we had conceived David lost sight of the question of whether or not we still really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egos had been wounded by our inability to conceive , to be the completeman and the complete woman , and we were flushed with a sense of satisfaction but not necessarily of happinesswhen we knew that Fran was pregnant at last . And as one does with a friend whose name one ca n't remember , we had greeted him with unreal and unfelt but extraordinary enthusiasm , and guilty with our not quite understood feelings about him , we had showered him with attentions and care and concern . Fran 's numbers . " You 're in a Seven year , Chris , and you must not expect . . . " One day in anger at having our life or our living influenced even slightly by such nonsense , I had ordered her not to get her weekly or monthly chart any more . But when she was sick , I had relented , and again they arrived at the house . I hoped it had given her comfort to read in her chart , " You will have some poor days at the beginning of the week , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked improvement . " I had reached the numerologywoman and had told her the truth about Fran 's dying , and I had said I did n't want her fed any horseshit , but that if the woman could be supportive , all right . The first savings book . I looked at the deposits . Five dollars , ten dollars . How proudly we had watched it grow . What misers young marrieds can be ! " If we can get togetherfive thousand , that will be enough security for the rest of our lives , and we can spend all we earn from then on . " What innocence ! How little we knew about anything . And finally . . Dearest Fran : This is the most wonderful day of my life . . And I knew all the rest but could n't read it , could n't face it . " I am so proud of you and want to protect you and help you grow . And I want to grow along with you , top243make you proud of me too . We know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you are afraid . You said over and over you never wanted to marry . I promise you you will only know you are married because you will feel my love now constantly . Do n't be afraid ! I love you . I love everything about you . I love holding you and . . . " I suddenly did n't want to be in that hotel room . I wanted to be back home sitting by the grave . Were the pine boughs still there or had they seeded it ? Had they been careful ? From the catch-all of poetry remembered from college , I thought ofThe grave 's a fine and quiet place , But none , I think , do there embrace . As I turned my head into the pillow I thought " Wrong , wrong ! " All over the world at all hours of the day and night the dead are reached for , clutched and embraced.  |p244I  awoke the next morning eager to get back to Marianne . Sex after months of starvation had made me hungry for sex . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , release , oblivion . There was vigor and ongoinglife in this feeling for Marianne . And there was caring . I lay on my back , thinking of her , seeing her strong presence in my bed back at the cottage . Such an active , loving , playful solicitous presence ! Some women were content to lie back and be " served , " as it were . Marianne seemed always to be serving , " doing all the work " as she smilingly put it as she looked down on me through her tumbling dark hair . But it was more than that.  |p245I  got out of bed , moved the gin bottle from the bedsidetable and looked at Fran 's mementos with no emotion . I brushed my teeth , shaved , showered , all the time turning over in my mind how I might reach Marianne . Telegraphing was useless , since in the village all telegrams were phoned or sent by mail . " Arrive home noon . . . Unsigned . " And what message would I leave if I called Mrs. Grader or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Jack Gresham , an old college friend and now a successful businessman . Jack had liked me and adored Fran , and though we had seen him and his wife only rarely since the early days , we were always able to take up where we had left off . He was a burly , attractive.red-cheeked Irishman , an " operator " but also deeply interested in things like philosophy , Japanese art , and " What the hell 's life all about anyway ? " He was deep in his paper as I stood in front of him . " May I share this table ? " He looked up , annoyed , then roared with laughter and pushed back the table and jumped up . " Chris , you son of a bitch . How are you ? " He grabbed my hand and gave me half a bear hug , trapped as he was behind the table . " Why did n't you tell me you were coming to town ? Sit down , for God 's sake . This is wonderful ! " He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Larsen here ! " And for ten minutes he enveloped me with gusty affection and warmth . " God , what a great girl she was ! I never laughed so much as when we three used to be together . She was a very funny woman . Not jokes , just funny because she was Fran . Some incredible innocence and naivetethat came out funny . . . oh , Christ , what a shame ! . . . How we all hated you ! Do you remember Paul Rafferty , with all his damned charm ? He told me once hep246took Fran for a long walk along the Charles to ask her very seriously what she saw in you . What a prick he was ! " Finally Jack talked about himself . " I guess you have n't heard . Nancy and I have been separated for some months . Nothing bitter about it . . . I do n't know , Chris . . . complex . The kids are gone . There just , well . . . there just does n't seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it sounds cool . But it never was anything like you and Fran . I mean , you had it made . " And he chuckled with appreciation . " The way it all finally happened was funny . We made all sorts of plans to build a new house , I guess something that would hold us together , and then one day when we were trying to decidewhether or not to have a porch or a terrace , we both realized almost simultaneously we did n't want a new house . We did n't want each other . Nancy 's still very attractive , lots of tennis and swimming and riding , you know . She 'll be married again in a flash , if she wants it . " " And you ? " He looked at me a long while . " I do n't think I want it . Oh , if I could have something like you and Fran . But I do n't know . All during my marriage I was too conscious of missing a great deal . So now I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He patted his breast pocket . " You had a little black book back then , if I remember rightly . " " With about three names in it . Mostly bluff . " He smiled . " I was always pretty much a one-name person . " " Well , you had the best name . How long are you going to be in Boston ? " " I 'm leaving almost immediately . " " Oh , why do n't you stay over and have dinner with me tonight ? " " No . " I shook my head , smiling . " Jesus , we have n't talked in years . I 've got a dinnerp247date with a girl , someone I see once in a while . " He smiled . " Very attractive , very obliging . But I can put her off , or . . . " He paused for a moment . " She has a friend , if you 'd be interested . " " Thanks , Jack , but . . . " " Look , do n't think me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't know how you feel . I understand your feelings . As a matter of fact , I envy you your feel-ings . " I wished he would keep still about my feelings . He made me feel the most complete hypocrite , assuming that in my grief I would find it distasteful and impossible to be with a girl . I thought of a conversation he and I had had in college , and for some reason out of it had come his statement , " Well , sex is probably not as important to you as it is to me . " I had smiled but not said anything , because at that time Fran and I were spending a good deal of time in bed , but it was a period when you did n't advertise it . He probably thought now , " Well , old Chris has n't changed . " Back in my room I packed my overnight bag and then decided I should call David . He might wonder why I did n't call last night . Well . . " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . Where are you ? " " I had to come up to Boston on business yesterday . I 'm at the Ritz . " " Oh . Well , you caught me on the way to a class . " " I wo n't keep you . I just wanted to check in before I left . " " Did Mackenzie reach you ? " " No . Why ? " " He 's been trying to reach you to tell you that that girl who won the fellowship is going to make her first appearanceMonday and he wondered if you 'd come see her . There 's going to be quite a thing in honor of Mom . " I was confused and said nothing.  | " I did n't tell him you were down there , but I wondered why he did n't know , since the kids used your beach for swimming . " He just let it hang there . " Well , only a few of them use it , and I asked them not to tell anyone around . " Oh , shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper this morning on the entertainment page . " " Oh , I have n't seen it . " " She 's much prettier in person . " " Why do n't you and Gretchen come down to the opening ? " " I 've got this class that meets in the evenings , and . . . " " I think it would he nice if you were there . " " Arc you going ? " " I think I should . " " Well , we might make it sometime during the week . I do n't know . I 've got to run now . Do you want to speak to Gretchen ? " " No , thanks . Just give her my love . " On my way out I bought the paper at the hotel newsstand , and looked at Marianne 's picture . David was right . It was not very good , but she was smiling , and unconsciouslyI smiled back at her . I was about to give the doorman the order for my car , when I suddenly wanted to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my suitcase , told him I 'd be hack in a few minutes , and headed for Shreves a block away . I was a notorious bearer of gifts , trinkets , trifles . It was one of my pleasures , one of my needs . It kept Inc in contactwhile I was away , looking for things to bring back . Carlyle had written that if we had no heroes , we would inventthem , make them . I wondered if there were no one I loved , if I would n't invent her to satisfy my need to give . The pleasure of going through a magazine and saying " That would be nice for Fran . " Now " for Marianne . " Though still I found myself looking at a dress or a blouse and saying " Nice for Fran . " I had given Fran a charm bracelet soon after our marriage , with one charm . After that , each charm had to be significant . You could practically read our lives by " telling " the fifty or sixty small gold charms . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for her opening , her professional debut . I looked at the bracelets in the case . Then I felt strange about it . I should find something else for Marianne . What to get for her that would be hers ? I had brought Fran almost everything I could think of , brooches , scarfs , leather-bound scrapbooks for her reviews , Battersea boxes with little messages , " From a Friend " . . . " Love the Giver . " Each one had had to show some knowing idea behind the gift , some nudge to a common joke or feeling . As I walked through the floors , I became aware of a certain irony in all this . I had been here before , playing this part before . Was it possible to play it all over again ? I was becoming tense with the impossibility of finding anything for Marianne which I had not thought of for Fran or actually given her . It seemed impossible to be original . I knew her so little , her likes and dislikes , colors , shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Christmas when I had almost come to hate Fran because after weeks of desperate shopping and looking , I could n't come up with anything special and unusual and " just right " for her . I was about to give up looking when I turned a corner and came upon a case full of rocks and stones , jade , quartz and crystal.  |p250A  s I drove out of Boston with my silly but very personal gift for Marianne tucked in my suitcase , I was eager to see her , to be with her , to ask how rehearsals were going , hear her lines , be swept up in the activity of her life . I wanted to rush in on her , arrive at her room with an armful of flowers , crawl into bed with her and simply say , " Here I am . " That seemed to be all that needed to be said . But of course I could n't do that . She would be at rehearsals , and I was n't going to walk into rehearsals and put my arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ! And incidentally , this is my girl . " No.  |p251I  felt she would n't want that either . I kept thinking that her feelings were prompted not so much by me as by the situation and her feelings about Fran and our marriage . Part of it was her way of being close to this whole experienceof our life together . This was her way of sharing something she felt was beautiful and sad and romantic . But was I right ? What was her real world ? I would not worry it . I wanted to be close to her , to help her , to love her . The relationship would define itself eventually . It was ridiculous to think beyond . Yet I could not resistthinking about her . I adored her . I was in awe of her talent and her dedication to her talent , as I had been with Fran . But the whole thing would be different this time around . Now I was secure in my work and career . I had money . There need be no meanness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran and I had found that we could not afford to eat in the hotel where we were honeymooning , but had to go for most of our meals to a bean-wagon . ) There would be no grubbiness with Marianne . No five-flight roach-infested walk-up . The Christmas in those two rooms with the skylight when we decided we could n't afford a tree , but I could n't stand a Christmas without a tree and late Christmas Eve bought a small one for " nothing " and decorated it with red , gold and green snips of metallic wrapping paper left over from gifts . With Marianne , it would all be the same , but it would all be different . Coming around the last curve of the beach road , I saw Bessie , the mail carrier , putting something in my mailbox . Not wanting to talk to anyone yet , I kept on going , down along the shore road , and then I came around again a half mile down the way . I had done this by instinct , the instinct developed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Marianne . Just as Ip252came around back , I had a revulsion at this secrecy , a desireto throw open the gate and leave it open , to live publiclywhatever that might involve . The complex hypocrisies and dishonesties were beginning to depress me . I wanted to feel the exhilaration of coming to a clean decision , in spite of knowing somewhere that I had felt such exhilarationsbefore and that most of them had dissolved later in compromise . I stopped the car , went to the mailbox , and hefted out the pile of junk mail accumulated there and tossed it in the car . As I had grown older , I had actually come to hate the mail and used to put off looking at it as long as possible . Except for the rare personal letter , mail was a seriesof small clutching hands eager to choke off one 's time . Bills , requests , " Will you read ? " " Will you speak ? " " Will you judge ? " " We are forming a committee . . . " In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I had driven through . As I came out of the drive and the woods and saw the cottage , I noticed the doors and windows were open , the curtains moving in the breeze . I had not expected Marianneto be there . I had thought she would be rehearsing . I got out of the car , excited . The sound of the car door brought Marianne to the back entry . " This place is not for sale . How many times do we have to tell you ? " And she opened her arms . " I 'm so glad you 're here . " " I 'm so glad you 're here . " " I thought you 'd be rehearsing . " " I will be this afternoon . " I stood there , holding her . " I missed you . " - " I missed you . It 's awful . " And she looked at me as though she hated missing me and wondered why she did . We walked into the house , arms around each other . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right does n't mean anything . " I stopped and held her again , savoring her , looking at her , shaking my head in wonder . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " And I rubbed my face against her hair . " Nothing does n't mean anything either . Is there something wrong with me ? " " Nothing . . . absolutely nothing . Ca n't a man shake his head in wonder ? " She moved to the counter to prepare coffee , and I moved behind her , cupping her breasts . She giggled . " You 'll make me spill . " I moved my hands away , but stood there pinning her against the counter as she measured out the coffee . I had been thinking about her the last miles , visualizing her body , working up a hunger for it . And there she was . And there I was . How many times in my life I had done that . Ready before I entered the door , assuming always that the girl would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , was ready . I always assumed the woman would be complimented . Sometimes she was . Sometimes she was n't . The time I had awakened at college and wanted to get to Fran and took a taxi into Boston at seven-thirty and slid into bed with her and made love and left in time for my nine o'clock class . She had been pleased that time . I stepped back . " I 'm sorry . I forgot . You have rehears-als . " " Not until two . " It was an exciting time , the separation heightening it , the realization of how much I had missed her , just being away one day . I blurted out , " We must n't be apart again . " She drew back and looked at me with a questioning frown , then nestled her head against my shoulder . She was loving and passionate but , I thought , a little reserved . I had the feeling that she was doing something for me , enjoyable but a little accommodating , as though itp254were a prelude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's arms , I said , " I 'm sorry . You did n't really feel like that . " " Yes , I did . " " That 's the first time you lied to me . " " I 'm not lying . " " I do n't like being obliged . " She looked down at me , serious . " I wanted to . I really did . " I smiled . " Okay . But just remember that . Unless you want to , I 'm not interested . " " A person enjoys doing something for someone else once in a while . " " All right . Once in a while . " I kissed her lightly . She smiled . " You funny man . " She kissed me . " I once heard a friend of Mother 's , a very sophisticated French woman . I have no idea how my mother knew her , but I was in the next room , and she was talking about husbands and wives , and after my mother said something about what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was concerned she felt an enormous sexual responsibility towards her husband . She said she maintained a policy alwaysof la bouche ouverte . ' " I laughed . " And that has influenced you . Right ? " " Not really . But I think about it sometimes . " I absent-mindedly traced a pattern on her shoulder . " But I should have known . You 're in rehearsals . You have other things on your mind . Insensitive of me . I do n't like being insensitive , in spite of the fact that I am all the time . " She smiled and touched my face . " You 'll find when I 'm working , writing , I do n't have too much interest in sex unless the work is going very well or very poorly . Celebrationor anxiety . How 's it going with you ? " " Very well . Mac 's a darling . Says all kinds of extravagantthings about me . " She smiled shyly . " Like what ? Come on . Word for word . " She turnedp255her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her face . She was blushing . " Like what ? Extraordinary ? Brilliant ? Genius ? " She giggled until she laughed . " He thinks I 'm good . " " I told you that . " " Yes , I know . But you 're suspect because of . . . well . . . " She moved her finger back and forth across my lips . " But he has me doing some phony things which bother me . " " Did you tell him ? " " No . " Her tone was of course not . " He 's got me look . . . " and she sat up in bed . I stopped her . " Do n't tell me . Remember , no advice from me . " " But look . . . " " No , period ! You 're going to have to work with dozensof directors in your life , you 've got to get used to gettingalong with them . " " But I do n't feel comfortable . " " You 're not supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . General statement , not coaching . Fran always loathed actors who wanted everything  --  lines , movements , emotions  --  comfortable ' for them . You 're not playing you . " " But I feel awkward . " " Maybe the character 's supposed to feel awkward at that moment . Look , I 've already said too much . Mac probablydoes n't have the time to go over these things with you , help you into them . He has to be satisfied with rather broad effects in the time he has . He 's a nice guy , not a great director , but good for what he has to do here , get a show on every week . " " But if I feel phony onstage , I 'm not going to do anyoneany good . " I drew her down to me . " You are going to be adora-ble. "
