In the 1960s , the war against poverty in America was not won , but there were some notable victories . According to U.S. Census Bureau figures released last week , as of 1969 the number of Americans classified as poor dropped to 24.3 million , down from 39.5 million in 1959 . Among both whites and nonwhites , the amount of upward traffic across the poverty line-$3,743 in annual income for a non-farm family of four , in 1969-was enormous . In 1959 , 18.1% of white families were classified poor ; in 1969 , only 9.5% . The proportion of poor non-white families was also cut nearly in half-from 56.2% to 31.0% . <P> Moreover , the rate of improvement for blacks seems to be at least marginally greater than it is for whites . From 1968 to 1969 , 5.3% of the black poor moved upward out of poverty , by the definition , while only 4% of poor whites crossed the line .
