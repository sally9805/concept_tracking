txt Pedestrians are being lectured to these days . A nationwide 10 ? day campaign is under way here to combat traffic accidents , and a dominant theme is education of an often-careless Soviet public in the rules of the road . Such a safety drive would have little news significance in other industrialized countries . But , the first of its kind here , it is still another indication that the Russians are moving into the age of the automobile , with all its attendant traffic problems and frustrations . // // The number of road accidents , in particular , is of mounting concern . No overall statistics ' are published , but- a few scattered figures serve to point up the problem . It has been reported that about 16,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the Russian republic in 1969 . This is a small number if compared with the fatal-accident figure for the United States that year , but sizable if one takes into account the relatively few vehicles on Soviet roads . In the tiny Georgian , republic , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first eight months of this year in which 455 persons were killed and 2,000 persons injured . In the central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan , 1,810 accidents , with 377 persons killed , were reported for a 10-month period . And , to cite one last figure , more than 6,000 accidents were registered in Moscow last year . Until recent times , Soviet police tended to hold the driven of a vehicle responsible in case of severe accident , and the law was little applied to pedestrians . But it is now recognized that pedestrians , especially in an inebriated state , are to blame for as many as one-third and more of all traffic accidents , and today they are being held criminally responsible if at fault . Anyone who drives in this capital can relate harrowing experiences with jaywalkers . Muscovites often are totally oblivious to oncoming traffic and dart in front of cars and trucks with reckless abandon . Drivers , too , are often undisciplined . In an effort to combat this tendency to anarchy , Soviet authorities are beginning to display more concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been posted and white dividing lines and crosswalks painted on major streets . About 150 underground passageways also have been built here . On this score , however , the government newspaper Izvestia reported this week that at one such passageway , it was necessary to erect three kilometers of fencing along the streets in order to force pedestrians to use it . . As for mechanical safety measures , these are still largely at the stage of public , discussion . For the past two years , for instance , there has been talk about starting the production of safety belts , but even the new Fiat car rolling out of Togliatti is not equipped with them ( although a locking device is provided for future use ) . Pedestrian education , for its part , is picking up . The current campaign , sponsored by the State Auto Inspection Office ( traffic police ) and running up Nov. 25 , features radio and television programs on road regulations , lectures in factories and offices , posters on buses and streetcars , and urban bulletin boards bearing reports on road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considering a proposal to introduce compulsory traffic instruction in the first through fifth grades of all schools beginning in 1972-1973 . And the chief of the State Auto Inspection Office urges that training of traffic engineers be begun .. Summing it all up , A Soviet journalist asked recently : " We are all glad that the number of cars in the capital will grow 75 to 80 percent in the current five-year plan . But will the pedestrian be ready for this ? "
