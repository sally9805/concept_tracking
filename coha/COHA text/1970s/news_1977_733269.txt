txt RODEBT FLEiscmit and his wife , Joan , sat impatiently in the lounge at Gate G-11 of O'Hare International Airport and watched Bugs Bunny dash across the screen of a color television set , The Fleischers had arrived how 's before the scheduled departure of their plane to Los Angeles to be the first to take advantage of the new $09 air fare that took effect last week . About the same time that the Fleischers began ! heir wait , Trans World Airlines pilot Hunt Hatch climbed into the scat of his Boeing 707 at the TWA maintenance base in Kansas City , Isle. , to begin his preflight check . FEB ' Miffs earlier , that plane had been sitting in a nearby hangar while scores of mechanics crawled over iL checking systems , installing new seats , and tearing out old carpeting . In just 72 hours , TWA spent $260,000 to refurbish the interior of that 707 to fire its opening shot of the air-fare war . About $140,000 of that money was for 104 new seats on the plane . Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $39 oneway , no.frills fare to Los Angeles $99 if you cat a mall , the Boeing 707 had been scheduled to handle the new assignment , When it landed in Kansas City late Sunday after hauling more than 100 charter tourists back from Europe , TWA mechanics were waiting to gut the interior and replace everything but the cockpit , galleys , and washrooms in time for Thursday 's flight . TWA 's new low fare was all Fleischer needed to change his plans : I WAS PLANNING to go to Maine on my vacation , " said the electrical foreman for Grand Kahn Electric . 1339 S. Michigan Av . " But when I read about the new fare the first day they advertised it , I changed my plans and made reservations for Los Angeles . There 's no way we would have gone to L.A. any other way . " Back in Kansas City , Hatch pulled the 707 onto time runway and spooled up the engines for takeoff . In the passenger cabin to the rear were a handful of TWA employes . Hatch was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty plane to a destination ? in this case to O'Hare to pick up the Fleischers and 145 other passengers for the $89 inaugural to Los Angeles . TWA was calling the flight " Super Coach " to plug the new fares , and the nation 's airlines were watching very carefully to See how " Super Coach " fared . TWA officials say It is booked solid throne ? September . THE INDUSTRY is watching carefully because Congress has been applying pressure on the Civil Aeronautics Board , the federal agency that sets airline fares and routes , to deregulate commercial aviation in this country . The CAB 's past policies , its critics in Congress charge , have results in higher air fares because of restricted competition . The CAB , under former chairman // Scramble pays off as fare war begins // John Robson , a Chicago lawyer , conceded that it probably regulates the industry too strongly and has prevented new airlines from entering the market . A strong hint of the new attitude at the CAB came earlier this year when Atlanta-based Delta Mr Lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its route between St. Louis and Chicago 's Midway Airport in an attempt to boost sagging business . The CAB declined to intervene in Della 's decision to cut fares , permitting them to go into effect July 11 as scheduled . In August , Delta , the only airline now serving Midway , has been able to boost ridership on that route by 990 per cent , according to Darrell Hatton , Chicago marketing director for Delta . THAT GAVE DELTA a head start on a deluge of applications by other airlines , some of which exist only on paper , to offer cut rate fares between Midway and other mid western cities . The CAB is hearing those petitions and could rule on them nest year . Meanwhile , TWA had nothing to lose by trying something radical on its Chicago-to-Los Angeles route . It is one of the most competitive in the nation with four different airlines TWA , United , Continental , and American offering 42 daily flights . TWA , long one of the financially troubled airlines in the industry , was losing $5 million a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights by managing to fill less than half of the seats available . The airline 's executives decided to offer a cut-rate $99 air fare on the route to boost ridership and drop three of its flights to reduce expenses . The rule of thumb in the airline industry is that if you are not filling at least 55 per cent of your seats , you are losing money . To make the plane more efficient . TWA equipped the " Super Coach " 707 with 184 seats  --  all coach  --  instead of the 127 it normally has its other 707s flying in domestic service , TWA executives also decided to hours a day in the air , compared with the airline 's average fleet use of only 9 hours a day . ONE OP THE basic laws of aviation economics is that a full plane in the air is making money . An empty plane on the ground is costing money . TWA officials hoped when they announced their plan that the other airlines would ignore it . There are 42 daily nonstop flights on that route , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other airlines did not bite , however . They argued that if TWA succeeded with its budget fare on the four flights , it could easily expand the service back to 10 , luring passengers away from them . Los Angeles-based Continental later announced It would offer 200 seats each way on its 10 DC-10 jumbo jets daily for only $89 ? without meals . TWA revised its plan to offer a no-meals ticket for $89 . Then American and United announced they would offer a limited number of $89 seats each way on their regular flights . AS THE DEADLINE for inauguration of the program approached , United and Continental announced they were upping the ante to 600 seats each way . American said it would offer as many Sat ) seats as it could sell . Its inaugural $89 fare DC-10 , which left O'Hare for Los Angeles at the same time as the TWA flight Thursday , carried 212 passengers-27 first class passengers tat $259 apiece , 76 coach passengers tat $159 apiece ) , 14 cut-rate fare eating passengers tat $991 , and ' 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we will be cannibalizing our ' other passengers to fill those budget seats , " one airline executive said . " Nobody is going to fly coach for $159 when they can get the same seat for $99 . " Continental added another dimension to the war late In the week when it began plugging its $119 Chicago-to-Los Angeles fares in other cities . Passengers flying from Baltimore , Philadelphia . New York , and Washington can ave 9:n ; on their fare to Los Angeles by shunning the regular naming flights from those cities and others by first flying to Chicago , then transferring to Continental . that airline announced . Continental flies no farther east than Chicago , and any passengers who take advantage of the deal will be lost to the other airlines .
