Farewell to the " pointy heads " <P> When he returned home from the National Governors ' Conference last winter , Alabama 's George Wallace was downcast . He was a " has-been , " he told reporters , no longer the center of attention . <P> That was hard to bear . For nearly two decades , Wallace had been an inescapable irritant in American politics , like a fly determined to become part of the ointment . He had first served as a state senate page at the age of 16 , but he seemed to have few prospects then . He sold magazines from door to door . After a stint in the Army Air Force , he won a job as an assistant attorney general , then as a state legislator , always feisty , eager to speak his piece . Elected a circuit judge in 1953 , he told the courthouse boys that he was going to run for Governor . Wallace was easily defeated in the Democratic runoff . His own judgment of the race was that he had been " out-segged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not happen again . <P> " Segregation now , segregation tomorrow , segregation forever ! " Wallace promised when he won the governorship in 1962 . He vowed to " stand at the schoolhouse door " of the University of Alabama to block its court-ordered integration , and he did . He had to step aside , but he had made his point , won his publicity . He was ready to run for President . <P> In his first foray into presidential politics in 1964 , Wallace proved extraordinarily popular not only in the South but among disaffected whites in the North too . He asked them to " send a message to Washington . " He promised to " shake the eye teeth of the . . . pointy-headed bureaucrats . " He galloped along shouting " law and order " as a code term for anti-black prejudice , and although he lost the Democrat ic nomination to Lyndon Johnson , he captured 29% to 43% of the vote in the Indiana , Maryland and Wisconsin primaries . <P> In 1968 , having installed his first wife Lurleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his American Independent Party . " It 's the working folks all over this country who are getting fed up and are gon na turn this country around , " he said . By carrying five states , he almost turned the electoral system around , coming close to causing a stalemate that would have given him the balance of power , but only close . This was Nixon 's election . <P> It was four years later , 1972 , when his message was perhaps most powerful , that he was tracked down and shot by the deluded Arthur Bremer while delivering a campaign speech in a Maryland parking lot . One of the bullets lodged near his spine , and he was paralyzed from the waist down . He had won Florida , Tennessee and North Carolina and went on to win in the Maryland and Michigan primaries , but his drive for the nomination was halted . So was his career . He tried yet again in 1976 , with male nurses carrying him in his wheelchair , but the old enthusiasm had faded . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his message , no longer dominated American or even Southern politics . And many others , including Jimmy Carter , had usurped some of his populist themes . Still , up until the March 1976 Florida primary , Wallace was a national political figure to be reckoned with , and part of Carter 's support in that state came from those who wanted to stop the Alabaman.
