txt The Carter I Administration won its first major legislative victory in the energy field today as the House Ways and Means Committee approved the type of tax on crude oil ! that President Carter had proposed as a centerpiece of his energy policy . The Administration won the battle for the crude oil equalization tax by a final vote of 21 to 16 after the committee , in a day-long session , rejected a series of attempts by a coalition of Republicans and oil-state Democrats to give producers a reduction in income taxes for invest ; ment in oil-field exploration and develop ; ment . Mr. Carter 's proposed tax would bring the cost of domestic crude oil , 87 percent of which is still under price controls , up to the cost of foreign oil . Imported oil accounts for about 42 percent of the 17 million barrels of oil consumed daily in the United States . Subsidizing of Foreign Oil Seen The Administration view is that the existing program of cost-sharing among refiners is in effect subsidizing foreign oil and that the cost of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The view that consumers should pay for domestic oil what it costs to replace it with foreign oil does not sit well with some liberal members of Congress and is likely to be challenged at later stages of the legislative process . But for the moment . the Administration has prevailed . The voting in the Ways and Means Committee was closely watched because of defeats suffered there and in a House energy subcommittee last week on other parts of the energy package . Those setbacks , particularly the subcommittee 's vote to end price regulation for new natural-gas supplies prompted an angry statement by the White House Friday to the effect that Congress was knuckling under to the oil and auto lobbies . Jody Powell , the President 's press secretary , said after the vote that Mr. Carter was " extremely pleased " by what he called the " courageous action " of the committee " in the face of an intense lobbying campaign by the oil industry . " The Administration 's victories in the Ways and Means Committee today were tarnished slightly by a setback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology . The committee rejected , by 19-11 , an attempt by Representative Thomas J. Downey , Democrat of Suffolk County , L.1. , to cut the authorization for the Clinch River breeder reactor from the $150 million previously approved by the committee to the $33 million requested by the Administration . Mr. Carter wants to stop construction of the $2 billion demonstration plant near Oak Ridge , Tenn. , as part of a larger and hotly contested policy aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons by curtailing the use of plutonium . The Clinch River plant would breed plutonium from uranium while producing electric power , a technology that would stretch many fold the energy yield of natural I uranium . The manufacturers of nuclear reactors , the trade unions and the electric utility industry have been trying to keep the project alive at a reduced level of funding . The Administration says construction should be halted indefinitely while research is accelerated into other types of breeder reactors . The crude oil equalization tax , to be paid by refiners , would lead to higher prices for gasoline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , by 1980 , when the tax would be fully in effect , it would add 5 to 7 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline . However , the Administration has proposed specific rebates for families that heat their homes with oil and general rebates for all taxpayers to return most of the $14 billion a year the tax would bring to the Treasury by 1981 . The committee put off consideration of rebates until tomorrow , when considerable controversy is expected . Joining the 12 committee Republicans in opposition in the 21-16 vote for the tax were four Democrats from Texas , Louisiana and Oklahoma , all oil states . Earlier , the committee broke with the Administration and voted by 22 to 15 for a more generous definition of new oil supplies , whose producers would be eligible to collect world prices , or nearly so . However , there is a jurisdictional tangle with another committee on this point . The Administration 's first victories came in the defeat of a series of amendments by Representative Joe D. Waggoner Jr. , a Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give producers tax credits  --  and even cash payments from the Treasury to producers with no tax liabilities  --  for reinvestment in oil development . Laurence N. Woodworth , th Assistant Treasury Secretary for Taxes and the chief Administration representative before the committee , labeled such " plowback " provisions a " ripoff " at the expense of consumers . He said the proposal to let producers keep up to 20 percent of the equalization taxes paid on their oil would amount to " a free gift bonus to the producer . " Mr. Woodworth noted that , under the Administration plan , producers would be allowed to realize the world price , or close to it , for newly found oil , a price the Administration contends is incentive enough for exploration . However , it was not all clear sailing for the Administration . The committee approved , by 22 to 15 , an amendment by James R. Jones , Democrat of Oklahoma , that would increase the volume of oil eligible to earn world prices for producers . Neither Mr. Jones nor the committee staff nor the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction was clear . However , even if the committee retains this provision in its final round of voting on the bill  --  the votes so far have been provisional , with exact legislative language still to come before the committee ? its legislative significance will remain in doubt . This is so , the committee staff said , because the definition of so-called " new new " oil  --  an intended redundancy in the energy lexicon  --  essentially falls within the jurisdiction of the House Commerce Committee . Differences such as these are supposed to be resolved next month by a House ad hoc committee on energy that will try to harmonize bills from several legislative committees . The Administration also lost a round when the committee voted to let the taxes lapse in September 1981 , when existing atuhority to control crude oil prices expires . Mr. Woodworth said that , if this became law , Congress would simply he making more work for itself because it would have to re-enact the taxes when it extends the price controls . The crude oil tax proposal was different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As revised by James C. Corman , Democrat of California , it provided for a series of differential taxes tailored to differences in price for each grade , type and location of crude oil . The Administration had proposed across-theboard average taxes , starting with $3.50 a barrel in 1978 for oil whose average price is now $5.15 a barrel . A barrel holds 42 gallons . The tax would increase in 1979 to about $7.70 a barrel . The best estimate now is that the levy would rise by another $3 in 1980 . The Administration had proposed to define " new new " oil onshore as oil discovered after April 20 , 1977 more than two and a half miles from an existing well or more than 1,000 feet deeper than any well within that radius , Mr. Jones 's definition would include oil from any property that did not produce within 90 days preceding April 20 and that was not part of a producing reservoir . Further analysis of this definition , which was used today for the first time , was expected .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
