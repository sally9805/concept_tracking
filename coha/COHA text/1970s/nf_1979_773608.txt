txt // 1 . Abundant Output . Even the lavishness of the Elizabethans can not excel that of this age . The development of new ideas brings fresh inspiration for poetry , and the poetical sky is bright with luminaries of the first magnitude . In prose we may note especially the fruitful yield of the novel , the rejuvenation of the essay , and the unprecedented activity of critical and miscellaneous writers . This is the most fertile period of our literature . 2 . Great Range of Subject . The new and buoyant race of writers , especially the poets , lays the knowledge and experience of all ages under a heavy toll . The classical writers are explored anew , and are drawn upon by the genius of Keats and Shelley ; the Middle Ages inspire the novels of Scott and the poems of Coleridge , Southey , and many more ; modern times are analysed and dissected in the work of the novelists , the satires of Byron , and the productions of the miscellaneous writers .

If for the moment we take the restricted meaning of the word , and understand by nature ' the common phenomena of earth , air , and sea , we find the poetical attitude to nature altering profoundly . In the work of Cowper , Crabbe , and Gray the treatment is principally the simple chronicle and sympathetic observation of natural features . In the new race of poets the observation becomes more matured and intimate . Notably in the case of Wordsworth , the feeling for nature rises to a passionate veneration that is love and religion too . To Wordsworth nature is not only a procession of seasons and seasonal fruition : it is the eye of all things , natural and supernatural , into which the observant soul can peer and behold the spirit that inhabits all things . Nature is thus amplified and glorified ; it is to be sought , not only in the flowers and the fields , but also in the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Political and Periodical Writing . The age did not produce a pamphleteer of the first class like Swift or Burke , but the turbulence of the period was clearly marked in the immense productivity of its political writers . The number of periodicals was greatly augmented , and we notice the first of the great daily journals that are still a strong element in literature and politics . The Morning Chronicle ( 1769 ) was started by William Woodfall , The Morning Post ( 1772 ) by a // syndicate of London tradesmen , and The Times ( 1785 ) , under the name of The Daily Universal Register , by John Walter . Of a more irresponsible type were the Radical Political Register ( 1802 ) of Cobbett and The Examiner ( 1808 ) of Leigh Hunt . A race of powerful literary magazines sprang to life : The Edinburgh Review ( 1802 ) , The Quarterly Review ( 1809 ) , Blackwood 's Magazine ( 1817 ) , The London Magazine ( 1820 ) , and The Westminster Review ( 1824 ) .

The increasing bitterness of the long war with France almost extinguished the literary influence of the French language , which , as was indicated in the last chapter , had been affecting English literature deeply . In the place of French , the study of German literature and learning came rapidly into favour . The first poetical work of Scott is based on the German , and the effects of the new influence can be further observed in the works of Coleridge , Shelley , Byron , and many more . In the course of time German increased its hold upon English , until by the middle of the nineteenth century it was perhaps the dominating foreign tongue . 6 . American Literature .

POETS I. WILLIAM WORDSWORTH ( 1770-1850 ) 1 . His Life . Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth , a town which is actually outside the Lake District , but well within hail of it . His father , who was a lawyer , died when William was thirteen years old . The elder Wordsworth left very little money , and that was mainly in the form of a claim on Lord Lonsdale , who refused outright to pay his debt , so that William had to depend on the generosity of two uncles , who paid for his schooling at Hawkshead , near Lake Windermere . Subsequently Wordsworth went to Cambridge , entering St John 's College in 1787 . His work at the university was quite undistinguished , and having graduated in 1791 he // left with no fixed career in view . After spending a few months in London he crossed over to France ( 1791 ) , and stayed at Orleans and Blois for nearly a year . An enthusiasm for the Revolution was aroused in him ; he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive , But to be young was very heaven ! He returned to Paris in 1792 , just after the September massacres , and the sights and stories that greeted him there shook his faith in the dominant political doctrine . Even yet , however , he thought of becoming a Girondin , or moderate Republican , but his allowance from home was stopped , and he returned to England . With his sister Dorothy ( henceforward his lifelong companion ) he settled in a little cottage in Dorset ; then , having met Coleridge , they moved to Alfoxden , a house in Somersetshire , in order to live near him . It was there that the two poets took the series of walks the fruit of which was to be the Lyrical Ballads . After a visit to Germany in 1798 ? 99 the Wordsworths settled in the Lake District , which was to be their home for the future . In turn they occupied Dove Cottage , at Town End , Grasmere ( 1799 ) , Allan Bank ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly the wellknown residence of Rydal Mount , which was Wordsworth 's home from 1813 till his death . Shortly before he had moved to Rydal Mount he received the sinecure of Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland , and was put out of reach of poverty . The remainder of his life was a model of domesticity . He was carefully tended by his wife and sister , who , with a zeal that was noteworthy , though it was injudicious , treasured every scrap of his poetry that they could lay their hands on . His great passion was for travelling . He explored most of the accessible parts of the Continent , and visited Scotland several times . On the last occasion ( 1831 ) he and his daughter renewed their acquaintance with Scott at Abbotsford , and saw the great novelist when he was fast crumbling into mental ruin . Wordsworth 's poetry , which at first had been received with derision or indifference , was now winning its way , and recognition was general . In 1839 Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L. ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ; and on the death of Southey in 1843 he became Poet Laureate . Long before this time he had discarded his early ideals and // become the upholder of conservatism . Perhaps he is not " the lost leader " whose recantation Browning bewails with rather theatrical woe ; but he lived to deplore the Reform Bill and to oppose the causes to which his early genius had been dedicated . Throughout his life , however , he never wavered in his faith in himself and his immortality as a poet . He lived to see his own belief in his powers triumphantly justified . It is seldom indeed that such gigantic egoism is so amply and so justly repaid . 2 . His Poetry . He records that his earliest verses were written at school , and that they were " a tame imitation of Pope 's versification . " This is an interesting admission of the still surviving domination of the earlier poet . At the university he composed some poetry , which appeared as An Evening Walk ( 1793 ) and Descriptive Sketches ( 1793 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they already show the Wordsworthian eye for nature . The first fruits of his genius were seen in the Lyrical Ballads ( 1798 ) , a joint production by Coleridge and himself , which was published at Bristol . Regarding the inception of this remarkable book both Wordsworth and Coleridge have left accounts , which vary to some extent , though not materially . Coleridge 's may be taken as the more plausible . He says in his Biographia Literaria : it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural , or at least romantic , yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith . Mr Wordsworth , on the other hand , was to propose to himself as his object , to give the charm of novelty to things of every day , and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural , by awakening the mind 's attention to the lethargy of custom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world before us . This volume is epoch-making , for it is the prelude to the Romantic movement proper . Wordsworth had the larger share in the book . Some of his poems in it , such as The Thorn and The Idiot Boy , are condemned as being trivial and childish in style ; a few , such as Simon Lee and Expostulation and Reply , are more adequate in their expression ; and the concluding piece , Tintern Abbey , is one of the triumphs of his genius . During the years 1798 ? 99 Wordsworth composed some of his finest poems , which appeared in 1800 , together with his contributions to the Lyrical Ballads . Among the most noteworthy of the new works in this collection were Michael , The Old Cumberland Beggar , // She dwelt among the untrodden ways , Strange fits of passion have I known , and Nutting . Although some of them , such as Michael and The Old Cumberland Beggar , are uneven in quality , the new poems show Wordsworth less preoccupied with his theories of poetic diction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy of touch . The Prelude , which was completed in 1805 but not published until 1850 , after Wordsworth 's death , is the record of his development as a poet . He describes his experiences with a fullness , closeness , and laborious anxiety that are unique in our literature . The poem , which runs to fourteen books , is often dull and prosy , but at times , particularly when he is describing the formative influence of nature , and his emotions when confronted by seemingly unreal natural objects , the blank verse is impassioned , and inspired by his exaltation , wonder , and awe . Such are the famous passages on skating and boating . The Prelude was intended to form part of a vast philosophical work called The Recluse which was never completed . Another section of this same work was The Excursion , much of which was composed in the years now under review , though it was not published until 1814 . It lacks the greatness of the finest parts of The Prelude , and its nine long books are , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosaic . Even so , it does contain some good pictures and tales of country life . Next to be published , in 1807 , were two volumes of poems which represent the fine flower of his genius . It is impossible here to list even the very great poems in these volumes , but in every poetic form that he used , with the possible exception of the narrative , Wordsworth is here seen at the height of his powers . To mention but a few of the successes of this volume , we have , in the lyric vein , The Solitary Reaper , The Green Linnet , I wandered lonely as a cloud ; in the philosophical , Ode on the Intimations of Immortality , Resolution and Independence , Ode to Duty ; and the Sonnets dedicated to National Independence and Liberty are of a quality which has led many critics to hail them as the finest sonnets in the language . After the publication of The Excursion Wordsworth 's poetical power was clearly on the wane , but his productivity was unimpaired . His later volumes include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waggoner ( 1819 ) , Peter Bell ( 1819 ) , Yarrow Revisited ( 1835 ) , and The Borderers ( 1842 ) , a drama . The progress of the works marks the decline in an increasing degree . There are flashes of the old // spirit , such as we see in his lines upon the death of " the Ettrick Shepherd " ; but the fire and stately intonation become rarer , and mere garrulity becomes more and more apparent . 3 . His Theory of Poetry . In the preface to the second edition of the Lyrical Ballads ( 1800 ) Wordsworth set out his theory of poetry . It reveals a lofty conception of the dignity of that art which is " the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge , " and which is the product of " the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings , " taking its origin from " emotion recollected in tranquillity . " The qualifications of the poet are on a level with the dignity of his art . To Wordsworth , he is a man " possessed of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thought long and deeply . " How far this view differs from that of poetry as a graceful social accomplishment is quite obvious : it partly explains Wordsworth 's sense of his own importance . Apart from these general views on the poet and his art , Wordsworthian dogma can be divided into two portions concerning ( a ) the subject and ( b ) the style of poetry . ( a ) Regarding subject , Wordsworth declares his preference for " incidents and situations from common life " : to obtain such situations , " humble and rustic life was generally chosen , because in that condition the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity . " Over these incidents Wordsworth proposes to throw " a certain colouring of the imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect . " ( b ) Wordsworth 's views on poetical style are the most revolutionary of all the ideas in this preface . Discarding the " gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are written in " a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation . " His views on poetic diction he summed up with these words : " there neither is nor can be any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition . " The extent to which Wordsworth 's own practice as a poet justified his theories is a question which has long occupied the attention of critics . In the realm of subject matter he remained staunch to his declared opinions , for the majority of his poems deal with humble and rustic life . That he was aware of the dangers inherent in his theory he makes clear in these words : " in some instances , feelings , even of the ludicrous , may have been given to my readers by expres296 A HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE sions which appeared to me tender and pathetic . " It is in this way that he sometimes fails . Generally , though , when Wordsworth writes under a strong emotional stimulus , his style is free from banality and prosaisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems , gay and joyous in other lyrics , and vigorous , with something of a Miltonic sweep and resonance , in his greatest sonnets and blank verse . In truth , though in his best blank verse it is fired by the passion of his imaginative insight to a grandeur above ordinary speech , it does not stray very far from the selection of the real language of men which he advocated . At other times , however , when the emotional stimulus is small or entirely lacking , he writes with his theories in the forefront of his mind , and the result is the prosaic banality of some sections of Simon Lee . 4 . Features of his Poetry . ( a ) Its Inequality and its Limitations . All the critics of Wordsworth are at pains to point out the mass of inferior work that came from his pen . Matthew Arnold , one of the acutest of the poet 's admirers , closes the record of Wordsworth 's best work with the year 1808 , even before the completion of The Excursion . This poem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies become more marked as the years pass . Before the year 1808 he had produced poems as intensely and artistically beautiful as any in the language . It was hard , however , for Wordsworth to appreciate his limitations , which were many and serious . He had little sense of humour , a scanty dramatic power , and only a meagre narrative gift , but he strove to exploit all these qualities in his work . His one drama , The Borderers , was only a partial success , and his narrative poems , like Ruth and The White Doe of Rylstone , are not among the best of his work . ( b ) Its Egoism . In a person of lesser calibre such a degree of selfesteem as Wordsworth 's would have been ridiculous ; in his case , with the undoubted genius that was in the man , it was something almost heroic . Domestic circumstances ? the adoration of his wife and sister and the cloistral seclusion of the life he led ? confirmed him in the habit of taking himself too seriously . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his longest works , The Prelude and The Excursion , describe his spiritual development in the most minute detail . ( c ) In spite of this self-obsession he is curiously deficient in the purely lyrical gift . He can not bare his bosom , as Burns does ; he can not leap into the ether like Shelley . Yet he excels , especially in the face of nature , in the expression of a reflective and analytic // mood which is both personal and general . The following lyric illustrates this mood to perfection : My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky : So was it when my life began ; So is it now I am a man ; So be it when I shall grow old , Or let me die ! The Child is father of the Man ; And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety . Sometimes he does touch on intimate emotions , but then he tends to be restrained , hinting at rather than proclaiming the passions that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kind : She dwelt among the untrodden ways Beside the springs of Dove , A Maid whom there were none to praise , And very few to love . A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye ! Fair as a star , when only one Is shining in the sky . She lived unknown , and few could know When Lucy ceased to be ; But she is in her grave , and , oh , The difference to me ! Such a lyrical gift , reflective rather than passionate , finds a congenial mode of expression in the sonnet , the most complicated and expository of the lyrical forms . In his sonnets his lyrical mood burns clear and strong , and as a result they rank among the best in English poetry . Wordsworth 's use of the Petrarchan form was so striking that he re-established its supremacy over the Shakespearian sonnet , which had eclipsed it in popularity during the last great age of sonneteering ? the Elizabethan . The influence of Milton is clearly felt , and the sonnets have strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of feeling . Some of them are patriotic , others express his passion for liberty , and yet others , such as the famous one composed on Westminster Bridge , deal with nature . All show clearly the beneficial influence on Wordsworth of the restrictions of the sonnet form , whose fourteen lines curbed his tendency toward prolixity. // ( d ) His Treatment of Nature . His dealings with nature are his chief glory as a poet . ( 1 ) His treatment is accurate and first-hand . As he explained , he wrote with his eye " steadily fixed on the object . " Even the slightest of his poems have evidence of close observation : The cattle are grazing , Their heads never raising ; There are forty feeding like one . The most polished of his poems have the same stamp , as can be seen in Resolution and Independence . " The image of the hare , " he says with reference to this poem , quoted below . " I then observed on the ridge of the Fell . " There was a roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell in floods ; But now the sun is rising calm and bright ; The birds are singing in the distant woods ; Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods ; The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters ; And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters . All things that love the sun are out of doors ; The sky rejoices in the morning 's birth ; The grass is bright with rain-drops ; ? on the moors The hare is running races in her mirth ; And with her feet she from the plashy earth Raises a mist , that , glittering in the sun , Runs with her all the way , wherever she doth run . ( 2 ) This personal dealing with nature in all her moods produces a joy , a plenteousness of delight , that to most readers is Wordsworth 's most appealing charm . Before the beauty of nature he is never paltry ; he is nearly always adequate ; and that is perhaps the highest achievement that he ever desired . The extracts just quoted are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) In his treatment of nature , however , he is not content merely to rejoice : he tries to see more deeply and to find the secret springs of this joy and thanksgiving . He says : To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears . He strives to capture and embody in words such deep-seated emotions , hut , almost of necessity , from the very nature of the case , // with little success . He gropes in the shadows , and comes away with empty hands . He can not solve the riddle of those obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things , Fallings from us , vanishings . Yet , with a remarkable fusion of sustained thought and of poetic imagination , he does convey the idea of " the Being that is in the clouds and air , " the soul that penetrates all things , the spirit , the mystical essence , the divine knowledge that , as far as he was concerned , lies behind all nature . Lastly , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts into words the idea of the continuity of life that runs through all existence : Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting : The Soul that rises with us , our life 's Star Hath had elsewhere its setting , And cometh from afar ; Not in entire forgetfulness , And not in utter nakedness , But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God , who is our home . Ode : Intimations of Immortality ( 4 ) This deeper insight underlying Wordsworth 's treatment of nature distinguishes him from many lesser poets . Though he is no inconsiderable landscape painter , as the opening lines of Tintern Abbey will show , he is seldom content to draw beautiful scenes for their own sake . He looks on nature to hear " the still , sad music of humanity , " and his portrayal of man seen against a background of nature gives rise to some of his best-known poems , such as The Solitary Reaper , Resolution and Independence , and Michael . These figures have something of the strength , dignity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems such as Tintern Abbey , Ode on the Intimations of Immortality , and some parts of The Prelude , which trace the development of his own relations with nature , from his boyish days with their " glad animal movements , " through his youth , when natural beauty had no need of a remoter charm By thought supplied , nor any interest Unborrowed from the eye ... . to his maturity , of which he wrote , // For I have learned To look on nature , not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes The still , sad music of humanity , Nor harsh nor grating , though of ample power To chasten and subdue . And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the blue sky , and in the mind of man : A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . ( e ) In style Wordsworth presents a remarkable contrast , for he ranges from the sublime ( as in the extract last quoted ) to the ridicu-lous : In the sweet shire of Cardigan , Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall , An old Man dwells , a little man , ? ' T is said he once was tall . Full five-and-thirty years he lived A running huntsman merry ; And still the centre of his cheek Is red as a ripe cherry . Simon Lee This verse illustrates the lower ranges of his style , when he is hagridden with his theories of poetic diction . The first two lines are mediocre ; the second pair are absurd ; and the rest of the verse is middling . This is simplicity overdone ; yet it is always to be remembered that at his best Wordsworth can unite simplicity with sublimity , as he does in the lyrics we have already quoted . He has a kind of middle style ; at its best it has grace and dignity , a heartsearching simplicity , and a certain magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare himself can better Wordsworth when the latter is in a mood that produces a poem like the following : " She shall be sportive as the fawn That wild with glee across the lawn , Or up the mountain springs ; And hers shall be the breathing balm , And hers the silence and the calm , Of mute insensate things . // " The floating clouds their state shall lend To her ; for her the willow bend ; Nor shall she fail to see Even in the motions of the Storm Grace that shall mould the Maiden 's form By silent sympathy . " The stars of midnight shall be dear To her ; and she shall lean her ear In many a secret place Where rivulets dance their wayward round , And beauty born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face . " Three Years she grew in Sun and Shower IL SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE ( 1772-1834 ) I. His Life . Coleridge was born in Devonshire , and was the youngest of the thirteen children of the vicar of Ottery St Mary . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child , " he says , " never had the language of a child . " When he was nine years old his father died ; he then obtained a place in Christ 's Hospital , where he astonished his schoolmates , one of whom was Charles Lamb , with his queer tastes in reading and speculation . He went to Cambridge ( 1791 ) , where he was fired with the revolutionary doctrines . He abandoned the university and enlisted in the Light Dragoons , but a few months as a soldier ended his military career . In 1794 he returned to Cambridge , and later in the year became acquainted at Oxford with Southey , with whom he planned the founding of an ideal republic in America . With Southey he lived for a space at Bristol , and there he met Southey 's wife 's sister , whom he eventually married . At Bristol Coleridge lectured , wrote poetry , and issued a newspaper called The Watchman ( 1796 ) , all with the idea of converting humanity ; yet in spite of it all humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1797 ) he met Wordsworth , and , as has already been noticed , planned their joint production of the Lyrical Ballads , which was published at Bristol . After a brief spell as a Unitarian minister , Coleridge , who was now dependent on a small annuity from two rich friends , studied German philosophy on the Continent ; returned to England ( 1799 ) , and for a time lived in the Lake District . There followed a serious attempt at political journalism , which failed because of his constitutional incapacity to provide regular contributions . In 1800 he was at Keswick , and , during what was to be his final period of great // poetical inspiration , produced the second part of Christabel and his ode Dejection . By now he was in almost continual ill-health , and by 1803 he had become enslaved to the opium which was to have such disastrous effect upon him . Ill-health and an unhappy domestic life sent him abroad to Malta and Italy ( 1804-06 ) , and on his return he began a period of restless wandering round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during these restless years that his lectures were given , starting with a very poor series at the Royal Institution in 1808 . The year 1811 saw his finest series of lectures , those on Shakespeare and other poets , which were followed by a further series in 1812 and 1813 . During this period he struggled with little success to break himself of the opium habit which was sapping his abilities , and then , in 1816 , he entered the house of a Mr Gillman , in Highgate . This provided for him a kind of refined and sympathetic inebriates ' home . Here he gradually shook himself free from opium-taking , and he spent the last years of his life in an atmosphere of subdued content , visited by his friends , and conversing interminably in that manner of wandering but luminous intelligence that marked his later years . From the house in Highgate he issued a few books that , with all their faults , are among the best of their class . 2 . His Poetry . The real blossoming of Coleridge 's poetical genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and wonderful . With the exception of a very few pieces , the best of his poems were composed within two years , 1797-98 . His first book was Poems on Various Subjects ( 1796 ) , issued at Bristol . The miscellaneous poems that the volume contains have only a very moderate merit . Then , in collaboration with Wordsworth , he produced the Lyrical Ballads ( 1798 ) . This remarkable volume contains nineteen poems by Wordsworth and four by Coleridge ; and of these four by far the most noteworthy is The Rime of the Ancient Mariner . Wordsworth has set on record the origin of The Ancient Mariner . He and Coleridge discussed the poem during their walks on the Quantock Hills . The main idea of the voyage , founded on a dream of his own , was Coleridge 's ; Wordsworth suggested details , and they thought of working on it together . Very soon , however , Coleridge 's imagination was fired with the story , and his friend very sensibly left him to write it all . Hence we have that marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strangely fused into one : the voyage through the polar ice ; the death of the albaTHE // tross ; the amazing scenes during the calm and the storm ; and the return home . In style , in swift stealthiness of narrative speed , and in its weird and compelling strength of imagination the poem is without a parallel . In 1797 Coleridge also wrote the first part of Christabel , but , though a second part was added in 1800 , the poem remained unfinished , and lay unpublished till 1816 . Christabel is the tale of a kind of witch , who , by taking the shape of a lovely lady , wins the confidence of the heroine Christabel . The tale is barely begun when it collapses . Already Coleridge 's fatal indecision is declaring itself . Incomplete as it is , and with its second part somewhat inferior to its first , the poem is yet clear evidence of Coleridge 's superlative power as a poet . The supernatural atmosphere is here less obviously created than in The Ancient Mariner ; Coleridge relies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly significant details in the story . There are passages of wonderful beauty and of charming natural description , though they scarcely reach the heights of The Ancient Mariner . The metre , now known as the Christabel metre , is a loose but exceedingly melodious form of the octosyllabic couplet full of skilful rhythmic variations . It became exceedingly popular , and its influence is still unimpaired . We give a brief extract to show the metre , and also to give a slight idea of the poet 's descriptive power : There is not wind enough to twirl The one red leaf , the last of its clan , That dances as often as dance it can , Hanging so light , and hanging so high , On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky . Kubla Khan , written in 1798 , was , like Christabel , unfinished , and it also remained unpublished until 1816 . It is the echo of a dream ? the shadow of a shadow . Coleridge avers that he dreamt the lines , awoke in a fever of inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over was distracted from the composition , so that the glory of the dream never returned and Kubla Khan remained unfinished . The poem , beginning with a description of the stately pleasure-dome built by Kubla Khan in Xanadu , soon becomes a dreamlike series of dissolving views , each expressed in the most perfect imagery and most magical of verbal music , but it collapses in mid-career . In the same year Coleridge composed several other poems , // including the fine Frost at Midnight and France : An Ode . In 1802 he wrote the great ode Dejection , in which he already bewails the suspension of his " shaping spirit of Imagination . " Save for a few fragments , such as the beautiful epitaph The Knight 's Tomb , the remainder of his poems are of poorer quality and slight in bulk . His play Remorse was , on the recommendation of Byron , accepted by the management of the Drury Lane Theatre and produced in 1813 . It succeeded on the stage , but as literature it is of little importance . 3 . Features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , slight though it is , is of the highest . ( a ) The most conspicuous feature of the poems is their intense imaginative power , superbly controlled , in his finest poems , by his unerring artistic sense . It exploits the weird , the supernatural , and the obscure . Yet , such is the power of true imagination , it can produce what Coleridge calls " that willing suspension of disbelief , " and for the moment he can compel us to believe it all . He sees nature with a penetrating and revealing glance , drawing from it inspiration for the stuff of his poetry . He is particularly fine in his descriptions of the sky and the sea and the wider and more remote aspects of things . ( b ) No poet has ever excelled Coleridge in witchery of language . His is the song the sirens sang . The Ancient Mariner has more than one passage like the following : And now ' t was like all instruments , Now like a lonely flute ; And now it is an angel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased ; yet still the sails made on A pleasant noise till noon , A noise like of a hidden brook In the leafy month of June , That to the sleeping woods all night Singeth a quiet tune . The epitaph we have mentioned is another fine example : Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn ? Where may the grave of that good man be ? By the side of a spring , on the breast of Helvellyn , Under the twigs of a young birch tree . The oak that in summer was sweet to hear , And rustled its leaves in the fall of the year , // And whistled and roared in the winter alone , Is gone , ? and the birch in its stead is grown. ? The knight 's bones are dust , And his good sword rust : His soul is with the saints , I trust . The reader of such passages can discover something of the secret of their charm by observing the dexterous handling of the metre , the vowel-music , and other technical features , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that genius lies . ( c ) Along with his explosive fervour Coleridge preserves a fine simplicity of diction . He appeals directly to the reader 's imagination by writing with great clearness . In this respect he often closely resembles Wordsworth . His meditative poem Frost at Midnight strongly shows this resemblance : Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee , Whether the summer clothe the general earth With greenness , or the redbreast sit and sing Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree , while the nigh thatch Smokes in the sun-thaw ; whether the eave-drops fall Heard only in the trances of the blast , Or if the secret ministry of frost Shall hang them up in silent icicles , Quietly shining to the quiet moon . 4 . His Prose . The same blight that afflicted Coleridge 's poetry lies upon his prose . It is scrappy , chaotic , and tentative . In bulk it is large and sprawling ; in manner it is diffuse and involved ; but in its happier moments it possesses a breadth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are admirable . Most of his prose was of journalistic origin . In theme it is chiefly philosophical or literary . In 1796 he started The Watchman , a periodical , ambitious in scope , which ran to ten numbers only . To this journal Coleridge contributed some typical essays , which , among much that is both obscure and formless , show considerable weight and acuteness of thought . He followed with much more miscellaneous prose , some of it being written for The Morning Post , to which he was for a time a contributor . In 1808 he began a series of lectures on poetry and allied subjects , but already the curse of opium was upon him , and the lectures were failures . While he resided in the Lake District he started The Friend ( 1809 ) , which was published at Penrith , but like The Watchman it had a brief career . // Then in 1817 , when he had shaken himself free from opium , he published Biographia Literaria and Sibylline Leaves . Biographia Literaria is his most valuable prose work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consecutive narrative it is quite worthless . After sixteen chapters of philosophizing , almost entirely irrelevant , he discusses the poetical theory of his friend Wordsworth , and then in the last seven chapters of the book he gives a remarkable demonstration of his critical powers . He analyses the Wordsworthian theory in masterly fashion , and , separating the good from the bad , upon the sounder elements bases a critical dogma of great and permanent value . These last chapters of the book , which are the most enduring exposition of the Romantic theory as it exists in English , place Coleridge in the first flight of critics . Second only in importance to Biographia Literaria in establishing Coleridge as the greatest of English critics are his lectures on Shakespeare and other poets , delivered at intervals between 1808 and 1819 . It is unfortunate that they were never prepared for publication by Coleridge himself , and that we have to rely on the imperfect records , prepared from notes and reports by his daughter in 1836 , and by Payne Collier in 1856 . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack the finish of works properly prepared for publication . None the less they show Coleridge as a giant in the ranks of English critics . His examination of Shakespeare 's plays and of poems by other writers gives us something more than an acute , logical dissection according to certain predetermined canons ; it is subtly suggestive , stimulating the reader to keener perceptions , and formulating for him his own vague , half-crystallized reactions . Every work of art he sees as an organic , developing whole , subject only to the laws of its own existence . A true romantic , Coleridge revolts against the Augustan conception of poetry as an art to instruct . For him the aim of poetry is to provide pleasure ? pleasure " through the medium of beauty . " In addition , he wrote ( 1825 ) Aids to Reflection . But he seemed to be incapable of writing a work of any size . After his death his Table Talk was published ( 1835 ) , giving fleeting glimpses of a brilliant and erratic mind . We give a short extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temperate admiration for the poems of Wordsworth , but also the nature of his prose style . As a style it is not wholly commendable . It is too involved , and clogged with qualifications // and digressions ; but , though he develops his ideas in a curious indirect fashion , he makes rapid progress . At its best Coleridge 's prose has much of the evocative suggestiveness of his finest poetry , and is an admirable stimulus to keener perception in the reader , 11 while his choice of language is discriminating , particularly in the fine distinctions he makes while describing the processes of artistic creation . Had Mr Wordsworth 's poems been the silly , the childish things , which they were for a long time described as being ; had they been really distinguished from the compositions of other poets merely by meanness of language and inanity of thought ; had they indeed contained nothing more than what is found in the parodies and pretended imitations of them ; they must have sunk at once , a dead weight , into the slough of oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But year after year increased the number of Mr Wordsworth 's admirers . They were found , too , not in the lower classes of the reading public , but chiefly among young men of strong sensibility and meditative minds ; and their admiration ( inflamed perhaps in some degree by opposition ) was distinguished by its intensity , I might almost say , by its religious fervour . These facts , and the intellectual energy of the author , which was more or less consciously felt , where it was outwardly and even boisterously denied , meeting with sentiments of aversion to his opinions , and of alarm at their consequences , produced an eddy of criticism , which would of itself have borne up the poems by the violence with which it whirled them round and round . With many parts of this preface , in the sense attributed to them , and which the words undoubtedly seem to authorise , I never concurred ; but on the contrary objected to them as erroneous in principle , and as contradictory ( in appearance at least ) both to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own practice in the greater part of the poems themselves . Mr Wordsworth in his recent collection has , I find , degraded this prefatory disquisition to the end of his second volume , to be read or not at the reader 's choice . But he has not , as far as I can discover , announced any change in his poetic creed . Biographia Literaria lll . LORD BYRON ( 1788 ? 1824 ) 1 . His Life . George Gordon Byron , sixth Lord Byron , was as proud of his ancestry as he was of his poetry , and his ancestors were as extraordinary as was his poetry . They stretched back to the Norman Conquest , and included among them a notorious admiral , Byron 's grandfather . The poet 's father was a rake and a scoundrel . He married a Scottish heiress , Miss Gordon of Gight , whose money he was not long in squandering . Though the poet was born in London , his early years were passed in Aberdeen , his mother 's i // native place . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the possession of the ruinous Abbey of Newstead , and Scotland was left behind for ever . He was educated at Harrow and Cambridge , where he showed himself to be heir to the ancestral nature , dark and passionate , but relieved by humour and affection . All his life through Byron cultivated the sombre and theatrical side of his disposition , which latterly became a byword ; but there can be little doubt that his Byronic ' temperament was not entirely affected . His mother , a foolish , unbalanced woman , warped the boy 's temper still more by her frequent follies and frenzies . The recollection of the tortures he underwent in the fruitless effort to cure him of a malformity of his foot remained with him till his death . Leaving the university ( 1808 ) , he remained for a while at Newstead , where with a few congenial youths he plunged into orgies of puerile dissipation . In the fashion of the time , he gloried in the reputation he was acquiring for being a dare-devil , but he lived to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of years upon the Continent ( 1809-11 ) . He had previously taken his seat in the House of Lords , but made no mark in political affairs . Then with a sudden bound he leaped into the limelight . Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ( 1812 ) , his poem on his travels , became all the rage . He found himself the darling of society , in which his youth , his title , his physical beauty , his wit , and his picturesque and romantic melancholy made him a marvel and a delight . He married an heiress ( 1815 ) , but after a year his wife left him . Regarding his conduct dark rumours grew apace ; his popularity waned , and in the face of a storm of abuse he left England for good ( 1816 ) . For the last eight years of his life he wandered about the Continent , visiting Switzerland , where he met Shelley , and , later , Italy . Finally the cause of Greek independence caught his fancy . He devoted his money , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gigantic , to the Greeks , who proved to be very ungrateful allies . He died of fever at Missolonghi , and his body was given a grand funeral in the England that had cast him out . 2 . His Poetry . Byron 's first volume was a juvenile effort , Hours of Idleness ( 1807 ) , which was little more than the elegant trifling of a lord who condescends to be a minor poet . This frail production was roughly handled by The Edinburgh Review , and Byron , who never lacked spirit , retorted with some effect . He composed a satire in the style of Pope , calling it English Bards and Scotch Reviewers ( 1809 ) . The poem is immature , being often crudely expressed , and // it throws abuse recklessly upon good writers and bad ; but in the handling of the couplet it already shows some of the Byronic force and pungency . The poem is also of interest in that it lets us see how much he is influenced by the preceding age . Next view in state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Now forging scrolls , now foremost in the fight , Not quite a felon , yet but half a knight , The gibbet or the field prepared to grace ; A mighty mixture of the great and base . And think'st thou , Scott ! by vain conceit perchance , On public taste to foist thy stale romance , Though Murray with his Miller may combine To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line ? Then followed the two years of travel , which had their fruit in the first two cantos of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ( 1812 ) . The hero of the poem is a romantic youth , and is very clearly Byron himself . He is very grand and terrible , and sinister with the stain of a dark and awful past . He visits some of the popular beauty-spots of the Continent , which he describes in Spenserian stanzas of moderate skill and attractiveness . The poem is diffuse , but sometimes it can be terse and energetic ; the style is half-heartedly old-fashioned , in deference to the stanza . Byron is to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of nature , and considerable dexterity in the handling of his metre . On , on the vessel flies , the land is gone , And winds are rude in Biscay 's sleepless bay . Four days are sped , but with the fifth , anon , New shores descried make every bosom gay ; And Cintra 's mountain greets them on their way And Tagus dashing onward to the deep , His fabled golden tribute bent to pay ; And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap , And steer ' twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap . Childe Harold brought its author a dower of fame , which in the next few years he was to squander to the uttermost . In the intervals of society functions he produced poetic tales in astonishing profusion : The Giaour and The Bride of Abydos in 1813 , The Corsair and Lara in 1814 , The Siege of Corinth and Parisina in 1815 ( published 1816 ) . These tales deal with the romantic scenes of the East ; they almost uniformly reproduce the young Byronic hero of Childe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stagy. // Written in the couplet form , the verse is founded on that of the metrical tales of Scott , whom Byron was not long in supplanting in popular favour , although the masculine action of Scott 's poems is lacking from his work . Instead there are vehement passions , which give his stories an impetuosity and speed quite different from the easy lucidity of Scott 's narrative poems . A vividness of description , based on Byron 's own experience of Mediterranean countries , fills them with patches of striking colour , but , though The Giaour , The Bride of Abydos , and Parisina are written in a more natural style than The Corsair and Lara , all reveal the lack of melody , the unevenness , and , in varying degrees , the artificiality which are typical of Byron 's work at this period . In 1816 Byron was hounded out of England , and his wanderings are chronicled in the third ( 1816 ) and fourth ( 1818 ) cantos of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage . In metre and general scheme the poem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very different from the first two cantos . The descriptions are firmer and terser , and are often graced with a fine simplicity ; the old-fashioned mannerisms are entirely discarded ; and the tone all through is deeper and more sincere . There is apparent an undercurrent of bitter pessimism that is only natural under the circumstances , though he dwells too lengthily upon his misfortunes . The following stanza is a fair specimen of this later and simpler style : They keep his dust in Arqua , where he died ; The mountain village where his latter days Went down the vale of years , and ' t is their pride ? An honest pride ? and let it be their praise , To offer to the passing stranger 's gaze His mansion and his sepulchre ; both plain And venerably simple , such as raise A feeling more accordant with his strain Than if a pyramid formed his monumental fane . During these years on the Continent he was not idle . Some of his longer poems are The Prisoner of Chillon ( 1816 ) and Mazeppa ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also composed a large number of lyrics , most of them only mediocre in quality ; and he added several great satirical poems , the most notable of which are Beppo ( 1818 , published 1819 ) , The Vision of Judgment ( 1822 ) , directed mainly against Southey , and , the longest of all , Don Juan . The Vision of Judgment is one of the finest of English political satires . Underlying the attack on Southey there is a bitter indignaTHE // tion , hidden beneath a mask of humorous burlesque and a sparkling , vivacious wit . The poem , which is written in ottava rima , shows a mastery of satirical portraiture only rivalled by that of Dryden and Pope . In range , in vigour , and in effectiveness Don Juan ranks as one of the greatest of satirical poems . It was issued in portions during the years 1819-24 , just as Byron composed it . It is a kind of picaresque novel cast into verse . The hero , as in the picaresque novel , has many wanderings and adventures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of its publication it was denounced by a shocked world as vile and immoral , and to a great extent it deserves the censure . In it Byron expresses the wrath that consumes him , and all the human race comes under the lash . The strength and flexibility of the satire are beyond question , and are freely revealed in bitter mockery , in caustic comment , and in burning rage . However , the mood of anger is but one of the many widely differing moods in this work , which is the fullest revelation of Byron 's complex personality . The stanzas , written in ottava rima , are as keen and supple as a tempered steel blade . The style is a kind of sublimated , half-colloquial prose , showing a disdainful abrogation of the finer poetical trappings ; but in places it rises into passages of rare and lovely tenderness . When affliction came upon him , in the words of Lear he had vowed a vow : No , I 'll not weep ; I have full cause of weeping , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll weep . But sometimes the poet prevails over the satirist , and the mocking laughter is stifled with the sound of bitter weeping . The first extract given below shows Byron in his bitter and cynical mood ; the tone of the second and third is far removed from such asperity : ( 1 ) Ovid 's a rake , as half his verses show him , Anacreon 's morals are a still worse sample , Catullus scarcely has a decent poem , I do n't think Sappho 's Ode a good example , Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample ; But Virgil 's songs are pure , except that horrid one Beginning with " Formosum Pastor Corydon. " // Lucretius ' irreligion is too strong For early stomachs to prove wholesome food ; I ca n't help thinking Juvenal was wrong , Although no doubt his real intent was good , For speaking out so plainly in his song , So much indeed as to be downright rude ; And then what proper person can be partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Round her she made an atmosphere of life ; The very air seemed lighter from her eyes , They were so soft and beautiful , and rife With all we can imagine of the skies , As pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife Too pure even for the purest human ties ; Her overpowering presence made you feel It would not be idolatry to kneel . Her eyelashes , though dark as night , were tinged ? It is the country 's custom ? but in vain ; For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed , The glossy rebels mocked the jetty stain , And in their native beauty stood avenged : Her nails were touched with henna ; but again The power of art was turned to nothing , for They could not look more rosy than before . ( 3 ) Thus lived ? thus died she ; never more on her Shall sorrow light , or shame . She was not made Through years or moons the inner weight to bear , Which colder hearts endure till they are laid By age in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful ? such as had not stayed Long with her destiny ; but she sleeps well By the sea-shore , whereon she loved to dwell . That isle is now all desolate and bare , Its dwellings down , its tenants passed away ; None but her own and father 's grave is there , And nothing outward tells of human clay ; Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair ; No stone is there to show , no tongue to say What was ; no dirge except the hollow sea 's Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades. 3 . His Drama . Byron 's dramas are all blank-verse tragedies that were composed during the later stages of his career , when he was in Italy . The chief are Manfred ( 1817 ) , Marino Faliero ( 1821 ) , The Two Foscari and Cain ( 1821 ) , and The Deformed Transformed ( 1824 . ) In nearly all we have a hero of the Byronic type . In Cain , // for example , we have the outcast who defies the censure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references to Byron 's own deformity . In this fashion he showed that he had little of the real dramatic faculty , for he could portray no character with any zeal unless it resembled himself . The blank verse has power and dignity , but it lacks the higher poetic inspiration . 4 . Features of his Poetry . ( a ) For a man of his egotistical temper Byron 's lyrical gift is disappointingly meagre . He wrote many tuneful and readable lyrics , such as She walks in Beauty and To Thyrza . His favourite theme draws on variations of the following mood : Do thou , amid the fair white walls , If Cadiz yet be free , At times , from out her latticed halls , Look o'er the dark blue sea ; Then think upon Calypso 's isles , Endeared by days gone by ; To others give a thousand smiles , To me a single sigh . Stanzas composed during a Thunder-storm In such lyrics he is merely sentimental , and the reader can not avoid thinking that he is posturing before the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Isles of Greece ( Don Juan , Canto III ) , he is little better than a poetical tub-thumper . Of the genuine passionate lyric there is little trace in his poems . ( b ) His satirical power is gigantic . In the expression of his scorn , a kind of sublime and reckless arrogance , he has the touch of the master . Yet in spite of his genius he has several defects . In the first place , his motive is to a very large extent personal , and so his scorn becomes one-sided . It is , however , a sign of the essential bigness of his mind that he hardly ever becomes mean and spiteful . Secondly , he lacks the deep vision of the supreme satirist , like Cervantes , who behind the shadows of the crimes and follies of men can see the pity of it all . In the third place , he is often deliberately outrageous . When he found how easily and deeply he could shock a certain class of people he went out of his way to shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) His style is quite distinct from that of any other romantic poet . Always an admirer of Pope , though he lacked his finish and artistry , he never completely freed himself from the poetic diction , personifi314 A HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE cation , and conventional epithets of the previous age . His faults as an artist are glaring : he had no ear for melody , his workmanship was careless , he had frequent lapses of taste , his dramatic blank verse was often rhetorical and declamatory in tone , and , especially when writing of himself , he was often guilty of repetition and overemphasis . On the other hand , there is in much of his work a vehemence and passion which give it an impetuous vigour . In his best satires the tone approaches the conversational in its naturalness , and he displays an epigrammatic wit and great vivacity . Sometimes he writes with simplicity and a tender beauty , as in the Juan-Haidee idyll in Don Juan . ( d ) A word is necessary regarding the fluctuations of his reputation . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived to hear himself denounced , and his poetry belittled . After his death Victorian morality held up hands in horror over his iniquity , and his real merits were steadily decried . Since those days his reputation has been climbing back to take a stable position high above the second-rate poets . In some European countries he still ranks second to none among English poets . He broke down the laboured insularity of the English , and he gave to nonEnglish readers a clear and forcible example of what the English language can accomplish . IV . MERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY ( 1792 ? 1822 ) 1 . His Life . Shelley was born in Sussex , the heir to a baronetcy and a great fortune . He was educated at Eton and Oxford , but from a very early age showed great eccentricity of character . He frequented graveyards , studied alchemy , and read books of dreadful import . While he was at the university he wrote several extraordinary pamphlets , one of which , The Necessity of Atheism , caused him to be expelled from Oxford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and morality generally , a violence that was entirely theoretical , for by nature he was among the most unselfish and amiable of mankind . His opinions , as well as an early and unhappy marriage which he contracted , brought about a painful quarrel with his relatives . This was finally composed by the poet 's father , Sir Timothy Shelley , who settled an annuity upon his son . The poet immediately took to the life that suited him best , ardently devoting himself to his writing , and wandering where the spirit led him . In 1816 his first wife committed suicide ; and Shelley , having married the daughter of William // Godwin , settled in Italy ( 1818 ) , the land he loved the best . The intoxication of Rome 's blue sky and the delicious unrestraint of his Italian existence set his genius blossoming into the rarest beauty . In the full flower of it he was drowned , when he was only thirty years old , in a sudden squall that overtook his yacht in the Gulf of Spezzia . His body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was found , and his ashes were laid beside those of Keats in the Roman cemetery that he had nobly hymned . It is impossible to estimate the loss to literature that was caused by his early extinction . The crudeness of his earlier opinions was passing away , and his vision was gaining immeasurably in clearness and intensity . 2 . His Poetry . His earliest effort of any note is Queen Mab ( 1813 ) . The poem is clearly immature ; it is lengthy , and contains much of Shelley 's cruder atheism . It is written in the irregular unrhymed metre that was made popular by Southey . The beginning is worth quoting , for already it reveals a touch of the airy music that was to distinguish his later work : How wonderful is Death , Death and his brother Sleep ! One , pale as yonder waning moon With lips of lurid blue ; The other , rosy as the morn When throned on ocean 's wave It blushes o'er the world : Yet both so passing wonderful ! Alastor , or The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of spiritual autobiography , in which the chief character , a shadowy projection of Shelley 's own moods , travels through a wilderness in quest of the ideal beauty . The poem is long , rather obscure , and formless , and is remembered chiefly for its lyrical passages and striking , typically Shelleyan imagery . It is written in blank verse that shows Shelley 's growing skill as a poet . After this came Laon and Cythna ( 1817 ) , afterward ( 1818 ) called The Revolt of Islam . It has the fault of its immediate predecessor ? lack of grip and coherence ; but it is richer in descriptive passages , and has many outbursts of rapturous energy . Then Shelley left for Italy . The firstfruits of his new life were apparent in Prometheus Unbound ( 1818 ? 19 , published 1820 ) . This wonderful production is a combination of the lyric and the drama . The story is that of Prometheus , who defied the gods and suffered for his presumption . There is a small proportion of narrative in // blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series of lyrics that both sustain and embellish the action . As a whole the poem has a sweep , a soar , and an unearthly vitality that sometimes stagger the imagination . It is peopled with spirits and demigods , and its scenes are cast in the inaccessible spaces of sky , mountain , and sea . In The Cenci ( 1819 ) Shelley started to write formal drama . In this play he seems deliberately to have set upon himself the restraints that he defied in Prometheus Unbound . The plot is not of the sky and the sea ; it is a grim and sordid family affair ; in style it is neither fervent nor ornate , but bleak and austere . Yet behind this reticence of manner there is a deep and smouldering intensity of passion and enormous adequacy of tragic purpose . Many of the poet 's admirers look upon it as his masterpiece ; but it falls short of the highest tragic level in the lack of subtlety in its character drawing and the inadequacy of its dramatic action . Even so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last words of the play , when the heroine goes to her doom , are almost heart-breaking in their simplicity : Beatrice . Give yourself no unnecessary pain , My dear Lord Cardinal . Here , mother , tie My girdle for me , and bind up this hair In any simple knot ; ay , that does well . And yours I see is coming down . How often Have we done this for one another ! Now We shall not do it any more . My lord We are quite ready . Well , ' t is very well . The poems of this period are extraordinary in their number and quality . Among the longer ones are Julian and Maddalo ( 1818 ) and The Masque of Anarchy ( 1819 , published 1832 ) . The latter , inspired by the news of the massacre of Peterloo , expresses Shelley 's revolutionary political views , and is very severe on Lord Castlereagh . The second stanza of the poem is startling enough : I met Murder on the way , He had a mask like Castlereagh ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him . In The Witch of Atlas ( 1820 , published 1824 ) and Epipsychidion ( 1821 ) Shelley rises further and further into the ether of poetical imagination , until he becomes almost impossible of comprehension . The former , the lightest and most delicate of all Shelley 's fantasies , // is rich in music and imagery , while Epipsychidion , with the same wealth of imagery , contains some of his most fervent writing . Adonais ( 1821 ) is a lament for the death of Keats modelled on the classical elegy . Though there is a jarring note in the attack on the critics , whom Shelley held to be responsible for the poet 's early death , the Spenserian stanza is here used with a splendid resonance and a force which increases as the poem progresses . It glows with some of the most splendid of Shelley 's conceptions . He has outsoared the shadow of our night . Envy and calumny and hate and pain , And that unrest which men miscall delight , Can touch him not and torture not again . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure ; and now can never mourn A heart grown cold , a head grown grey , in vain ? Nor , when the spirit 's self has ceased to burn , With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn . He lives , he wakes ? ' t is Death is dead , not he ; Mourn not for Adonais ? Thou , young Dawn , Turn all thy dew to splendour , for from thee The spirit thou lamentest is not gone ! Ye caverns and ye forests , cease to moan ! Cease , ye faint flowers and fountains ! and , thou Air , Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown O'er the abandoned Earth , now leave it bare Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair ! With the longer poems went a brilliant cascade of shorter lyrical pieces . To name them is to mention some of the sweetest English lyrics . The constantly quoted To a Skylark and The Cloud are among them ; so are some exquisite songs , such as The Indian Serenade , Music , when soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the longer occasional pieces ? for example , Lines written among the Euganean Hills , and the Letter to Maria Gisborne . Of his many beautiful odes , the most remarkable is Ode to the West Wind . The stanzas have the elemental rush of the wind itself , and the conclusion , where Shelley sees a parallel to himself , is the most remarkable of all : Make me thy lyre , ev'n as the forest is : What if my leaves are falling like its own ! The tumult of thy mighty harmonies Will take from both a deep autumnal tone , Sweet though in sadness . Be thou , Spirit fierce , My spirit ! be thou me , impetuous one ! // Drive my dead thoughts over the universe Like wither 'd leaves , to quicken a new birth ; And , by the incantation of this verse . Scatter , as from an unextinguish 'd hearth Ashes and sparks , my words among mankind ! Be through my lips to unawaken 'd earth The trumpet of a prophecy ! 0 Wind , If Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Prose . Shelley began his literary career with two boyish romances , Zastrozzi and St Irvyne . These books were written when he was still at school , and are almost laughably bad in style and story . The only other prose work that is worth mention is his short essay The Defence of Poetry ( 1821 , published 1840 ) . The work is soundly written , and is a strong exposition of the Romantic point of view . His published letters show him to have been a man of considerable common sense , and not merely the crazy theorist of popular imagination . His prose style is somewhat heavy , but always clear and readable . 4 . Features of his Poetry . ( a ) His lyrical power is equal to the highest to be found in any language . It is now recognized to be one of the supreme gifts in literature , like the dramatic genius of Shakespeare . This gift is shown at its best when it expresses the highest emotional ecstasy , as in the lyrics of Prometheus Unbound . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passion that pervades his lyrics , he is seldom shrill and tuneless . He can also express a mood of blessed cheerfulness , a sane and delectable joy . To the Spirit of Delight he says : I love Love , though he has wings And like light can flee , But above all other things , Spirit , I love thee . Thou art love and life ! 0 come , Make once more my heart thy home . He can also express the keenest note of depression and despair , as in the lyric 0 World ! 0 Life ! 0 Time ! ( b ) Shelley 's choice of subject makes it convenient to divide his work into two broad groups , the one consisting of his visionary , prophetic works such as Alastor , or the Spirit of Solitude , The Revolt of Islam , Prometheus Unbound , and similar poems , and the other of his shorter lyrics . In almost all of the visionary poems we see // the Shelleyan hero , a rebel against tyranny and a leader in the struggle which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Byronic hero , these figures are , to a large extent , projections of the character of their creator . Often the symbolism of the poems is not sufficiently clear or sustained , and the result is some confusion in the mind of the reader . In the subjects of his shorter poems he differs from such a poet as Burns , who is almost the only other poet who challenges him as master of the lyric . Shelley lacks the homely appeal of Burns ; he loves to roam through space and infinity . In his own words he feeds on the aerial kisses Of shapes that haunt thought 's wildernesses . He rejoices in nature , but nature of a spiritual kind , which he peoples with phantoms and airy beings : I love all that thou lovest , Spirit of Delight ! The fresh Earth in new leaves drest , And the starry night ; Autumn evening , and the morn When the golden mists are born . I love snow , and all the forms Of the radiant frost : I love waves , and winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may be Untainted by man 's misery . Frequently he is concerned with the thought of death or his own sense of despair or loneliness : O world ! 0 life ! . O time ! On whose last steps I climb , Trembling at that where I had stood before ; When will return the glory of your prime ? No more ? Oh , never more ! Out of the day and night A joy has taken flight ; Fresh spring , and summer , and winter hoar , Move my faint heart with grief , but with delight No more ? Oh , never more ! ( c ) His descriptive power at once strikes the imagination . The effect is instantaneous . His fancy played among wild and elemental // things , but it gave them form and substance , as well as a radiant loveliness .

The Pine Forest of the Cascine near Pisa ( d ) His style is perfectly attuned to his purpose . Like all the finest lyrical styles , it is simple , flexible , and passionate . It has a direct clarity , an easy , yet striking , lucidity , and a purity of language which are peculiarly Shelley 's own . Sometimes , as in The Cenci , it rises to a commanding simplicity . The extracts already given sufficiently show this . ( e ) Shelley 's limitations are almost as plain as his great abilities .

Even to Scott , who with all his Tory prejudices was liberal enough in his views on literature , he was simply " that atheist Shelley . " After his death his reputation rose rapidly , and by the middle of the nineteenth century his position was assured . By the curious alternation that seems to affect popular taste , his fame since that time has paled a little ; but no fluctuations in taste can ever remove him from his place among the great . V. JOHN KEATS ( 1795 ? 1821 ) 1 . His Life . Keats was born in London , the son of the well-todo keeper of a livery stable . He was educated at a private school at Enfield , and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to a surgeon . In 1814 he transferred his residence to London , and followed part of // the regular course of instruction prescribed for medical students . Already , however , his poetical bent was becoming apparent . Surgery lost its slight attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility when he made the acquaintance of Leigh Hunt ( 1816 ) , the famous Radical journalist and poet , whose collisions with the Government had caused much commotion and his own imprisonment . Keats was soon intimate with the Radical brotherhood that surrounded Leigh Hunt , and thus he became known to Shelley and others . In 1817 he published his first volume of verse , but it attracted little notice , in spite of the championship of Hunt . By this time the family tendency to consumption became painfully manifest in him , and he spent his time in searching for places , including the Isle of Wight and the suburbs of London , where his affliction might be remedied . While he was staying in London he became acquainted with Fanny Brawne , and afterward was engaged to her for a time . His malady , however , became worse , and the mental and physical distress caused by his complaint , added to despair regarding the success of his love-affair , produced a frantic state of mind painfully reflected in his letters to the young lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the poet 's death . His second volume of verse , published in 1818 , was brutally assailed by The Quarterly Review and by Blackwood 's Magazine . These Tory journals probably struck at him because of his friendship with the Radical Leigh Hunt . Keats bore the attack with apparent serenity , and always protested that he minded it little ; but there can be little doubt that it affected his health to some degree . In 1820 he was compelled to seek warmer skies , and died in Rome early in the next year , at the age of twenty-five . 2 . His Poetry . When he was about seventeen years old Keats became acquainted with the works of Spenser , and this proved to be the turning-point in his life . The mannerisms of the Elizabethan immediately captivated him , and he resolved to imitate him . His earliest attempt at verse is his Imitation of Spenser ( 1813 ) , written when he was eighteen . This and some other short pieces were published together in his Poems ( 1817 ) , his first volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit , except for some of its sonnets , which include the superb On first looking into Chapman 's Homer . The poems , which include Sleep and Poetry and I stood tip-toe upon a little hill , show the influence of Spenser and , more immediately , of Leigh Hunt , to whom the volume was dedicated . // Of a different quality was his next volume , called Endymion ( 1818 ) . Probably based partly on Drayton 's The Man in the Moon and Fletcher 's The Faithful Shepherdess , this remarkable poem of Endymion professes to tell the story of the lovely youth who was kissed by the moon-goddess on the summit of Mount Latmos . Keats develops this simple myth into an intricate and flowery and rather obscure allegory of over four thousand lines . The work is clearly immature , and flawed with many weaknesses both of taste and of construction , but many of the passages are most beautiful , and the poem shows the tender budding of the Keatsian style ? a rich and suggestive beauty obtained by a richly ornamented diction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory that Keats followed during the whole of his poetical career : A thing of beauty is a joy for ever . The crudeness of the work laid it temptingly open to attack , and , as we have noticed , the hostile reviews found it an easy prey . Keats 's health was already failing , but the amount of poetry he wrote is marvellous both in magnitude and in quality . His third and last volume , published in 1820 just before he left England , contains a collection of poems of the first rank , which were written approximately in the order that follows . Isabella , or The Pot of Basil ( 1818 ) , is a version of a tale from Boccaccio , and deals with the murder of a lady 's lover by her two wicked brothers . The poem , which is written in ottava rima , marks a decided advance in Keats 's work . The slips of taste are fewer ; the style deeper in tone ; the tale is told with an economy and precision new in Keats ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting in pathos . In Hyperion ( begun 1818 , abandoned 1819 ) Keats took up the epic theme of the primeval struggle between the older race of gods , such as Saturn and Hyperion , and the younger divinities , such as Apollo . Both in style and structure the poem is modelled on Paradise Lost . The blank verse has not only many of the typically Miltonic tricks of style , but also much of the sonorous weight and dignity of its model . At the same time , it replaces the vigour and passion of Milton with a repose and charm of its own . As the poem progresses the Miltonic is gradually supplanted by a tone more truly Keats 's own , and in the third book it ends abruptly , because , as Keats himself said , it was too Miltonic . It is doubtful whether it could ever have been completed as it lacks the gripping action which // must be the basis of the epic poem . Yet , as far as it goes , Hyperion is a successful work , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Book II provides us with the fullest exposition he was ever to give of his theory that " first in beauty shall be first in might , " and the poem shows clearly his growing control over structure and style . It is full of striking passages , of which the following , the opening lines , is a good example : Deep in the shady sadness of a vale Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn , Far from the fiery noon , and eve 's one star , Sat gray-hair 'd Saturn , quiet as a stone , Still as the silence round about his lair ; Forest on forest hung about his head Like cloud on cloud . No stir of air was there , Not so much life as on a summer 's day Robs not one light seed from the feather 'd grass , But where the dead leaf fell , there did it rest . A stream went voiceless by , still deaden 'd more By reason of his fallen divinity Spreading a shade : the Naiad ' mid her reeds Press 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St Agnes ( 1819 ) , regarded by others as his finest narrative poem , is a tale of the elopement of two lovers . The story is slight but moves quickly ; the background of family feud is kept well in mind , and the love scenes are more controlled than those in Isabella , or the Pot of Basil . In the chivalric tone , the stanza form , and the occasional archaisms the influence of Spenser is seen ; but the style is Keats 's own , and the poem is full of beauties of description , imagery , and colour . It is sensuous and highly decorative without being cloying . Typical of its exquisite beauty is the following stanza : Full on this casement shone the wintry moon , And threw warm gules on Madeline 's fair breast , As down she knelt for heaven 's grace and boon ; Rose-bloom fell on her hands , together prest , And on her silver cross soft amethyst , And on her hair a glory , like a saint : She seem 'd a splendid angel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porphyro grew faint : She knelt , so pure a thing , so free from mortal taint . In the same year was written The Eve of Saint Mark , which remains Unfinished . It has the fine pictorial work of The Eve of St Agnes , 1 ; // but the material is handled with more restraint . In style it is effortless , and free from Keats 's fault of over-luxuriance . The story of Lamia ( 1819 ) is taken from Burton 's The Anatomy of Melancholy ( see p. 121 ) and tells of a beautiful enchantress . The narrative is well handled , runs smoothly , and shows a truer sense of proportion than Endymion , though , here again , the story is rendered somewhat obscure by the introduction of a rather confused allegory . In style it is modelled on the fables of Dryden , and the heroic couplet is skilfully used . The poem is full of typically Keatsian pictorial richness , which , on occasion , becomes rather excessive . The following description of the snake-enchantress is one of the more gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dazzling hue , Vermilion-spotted , golden , green , and blue ; Striped like a zebra , freckled like a pard , Eyed like a peacock , and all crimson barr 'd ; And full of silver moons , that , as she breathed , Dissolv 'd , or brighter shone , or interwreathed Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries ? So rainbow-sided , touch 'd with miseries , She seem 'd , at once , some penanced lady elf , Some demon 's mistress , or the demon 's self . Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire Sprinkled with stars , like Ariadne 's tiar : Her head was serpent , but ah , bitter-sweet ! She had a woman 's mouth with all its pearls complete : And for her eyes : what could such eyes do there But weep , and weep , that they were born so fair ? As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air . He throat was serpent , but the words she spake Came , as through bubbling honey , for Love 's sake . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Fall of Hyperion , a Dream . Casting off the Miltonic style of the first version , Keats here creates a blank verse of his own , flexible , powerful , and sonorous , a blank verse which accords well with a severer and more thoughtful tone than is to be found in any other of his poems . It carries still further Keats 's philosophy of beauty , which he now feels to be attainable only by those who have experienced pain . Over the merits of this revision , as compared with the original draft , controversy has raged . A comparison of parallel versions of the same passage will show that , in many cases , the splendour and magic of the first have gone . On the other hand , it may be argued that not only is the poem more // truly Keats 's own , but that it shows a deeper insight into human problems . Together with the longer poems are many shorter pieces of supreme beauty . The great odes ? To a Nightingale , On a Grecian Urn , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all written in 1819 , and in their approach to flawless perfection the best of them are unequalled in Keats . Between the impassioned longing for escape of the first and the calm of fruition of the last there is a very great difference , but all , with the exception of To Autumn , show a concern with the poet 's desire for true beauty , and they thus have a close link with Endymion , Hyperion , Lamia , and The Fall of Hyperion . The odes are experiments in verse form based on the sonnet . All , except To Autumn , which has an eleven-line stanza , are in stanzas of ten lines , made up of the Shakespearian quatrain and the Petrarchan sestet . We quote the first stanza of the wellknown Ode to Autumn , probably the most perfect poem Keats ever wrote : Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness , Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun ; Conspiring with him how to load and bless With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run ; To bend with apples the moss 'd cottage-trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To swell the gourd , and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel ; to set budding more , And still more , later flowers for the bees , Until they think warm days will never cease , For Summer has o'er-brimm 'd their clammy cells . As a sonneteer Keats ranks with the greatest English poets . Of his sixty-one sonnets some ten , including On first looking into Chapman 's Homer , When I have fears that I may cease to be , and Bright Star , would I were stedfast as thou art , are worthy to be ranked with those of Shakespeare . After a strict adherence to the Petrarchan form in the 1817 volume , Keats turned to the Shakespearian form , which undoubtedly suited him better . The sonnet quoted below will show how effortless is his best work in this medium : When I have fears that I may cease to be Before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain , Before high-piled books , in charactery , Hold like rich garners the full ripen 'd grain ; When I behold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high romance , // And think that I may never live to trace Their shadows , with the magic hand of chance ; And when I feel , fair creature of an hour , That I shall never look upon thee more , Never have relish in the faery power Of unreflecting love ; ? then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone , and think Till love and fame to nothingness do sink . Among the other shorter poems La Belle Dame sans Merci , a kind of lyrical ballad , is considered to be one of the choicest in the language . In 1819 Keats collaborated in a drama , Otho the Great , and began another , King Stephen , which he did not complete . Neither effort is of much consequence . The Cap and Bells , a longish fairytale which also is unfinished , is much below the level of his usual work . 3 . Features of his Poetry . ( a ) His choice of subject differs from that of most of the other major romantic poets . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the imagery of his poems , but it involves none of the mystical worship of the " mighty being " which we have seen in Wordsworth . He has none of the satirical bent of Byron , and little of the prophetic vein of Shelley ; rather is he the poet of legend and myth , of romance and chivalric tale . He had no knowledge of Greek and little of Greece , but none of his contemporaries was so moved by the spirit of Greece , and none so skilfully captured the charm of its seaboard as did Keats in this passage : Who are these coming to the sacrifice ? To what green altar , 0 mysterious priest , Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies , And all her silken flanks with garlands drest ? What little town by river or sea-shore , Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel , Is emptied of this folk , this pious morn ? And , little town , thy streets for evermore Will silent be ; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate , can e'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , there was intermingled with his love of romantic story a concern for deeper spiritual issues , and in his last long work , The Fall of Hyperion , a Dream , we find his most mature exposition of his belief in the sovereign power of beauty . Previously it had found expression in Endymion , Hyperion , Lamia , and // the ode On a Grecian Urn . In his sonnets and odes he had moments of lyrical self-revelation , and , though his lyric work is less in quantity than his narrative , its quality is such as to suggest that here , too , had he lived , Keats might have rivalled the greatest . ( b ) His style is even more distinctively his own , and it has had a great effect on later English poets , most notably on Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites . The most striking feature of his work is the speed with which he learned his craft , and evolved from the imitator of Leigh Hunt , Spenser , Shakespeare , or Milton to the artist with a style of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decorative effect , full of colour and the images of the senses ( particularly of touch ) . In his own metaphor , every rift was loaded with ore . But often the result was an over-luxuriance and a lack of restraint which betray his , as yet , uncertain taste and the weakness of his artistic economy . Two years from the publication of Endymion sufficed for him to evolve the blank verse of The Fall of Hyperion , and to reach perfection in narrative and lyric forms in The Eve of St Agnes and the best of his odes . In the new Keats all the qualities of the old are controlled by a restraint and poise , a delicacy of touch and a purer taste , and the result is one of the most striking of all glish poetic styles . 4 . His Prose . Unlike Wordsworth , Keats made no attempt at a tematic formulation of his views on his art . His Letters , however , ve a clearer insight into his mind and artistic development than y formal treatise could have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the most interesting letters their day . They reveal his profound insight into his own spiritual wth , and show how passionate was his love for poetry . We give e or two typically significant passages : I find I can not exist without poetry ? without eternal poetry ? half the day will not do ? the whole of it ? I began with a little but habit has made me a Leviathan . I had become all in a trouble from not having written anything of late ? the sonnet overleaf did me good . I slept the better last night for it . I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart 's affections , and the truth of imagination . What the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth . ... with a great poet the sense of beauty overcomes every other consideration , or rather obliterates all consideration . . if poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves to a tree it had better not come at all . // Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ? OTHER POETS 1 . Robert Southey ( 1774 ? 1843 ) . Southey was born at Bristol , educated at Westminster School and at Oxford , and settled down to lead the laborious life of a man of letters . He produced a great mass of work , much of which is of considerable merit , and he ranked as one of the leading writers of his age . Most of his work was written at Greta Hall , near Keswick , where he lived most of his life . He was made Poet Laureate in 1813 . His reputation , especially as a poet , has not been maintained . His poems , which are of great bulk , include Joan of Arc ( 1798 ) , Thalaba the Destroyer ( 1801 ) , The Curse of Kehama ( 1810 ) , and Roderick , the Last of the Goths ( 1814 ) . Typically romantic in theme , most of them were too ambitious for a poet of Southey 's limitations . In style they are straightforward and unaffected , but they lack the transfiguring fire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , such as The Holly-tree , The Battle of Blenheim , and The Inchcape Rock , are still in favour , and deservedly so . His numerous prose works include The History of Brazil ( 1810 ? 19 ) and The History of the Peninsular War ( 1823 ? 32 ) . The slightest of them all , The Life of Nelson ( 1813 ) , is the only one now freely read . It shows Southey 's easy middle ' style at its best . 2 . Thomas Moore ( 1779 ? 1852 ) . Moore was born in Dublin , took his degree at Trinity College , and studied law in London at the Inner Temple . He was imbued with revolutionary notions , and attempted to apply them to Ireland , but with no success . He obtained a valuable appointment in the Bermudas , the duties of which were discharged by a deputy , who in this case proved faithless and caused Moore financial loss . Moore was a friend of Byron and a prominent literary figure of the time . Most of his life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were highly successful during his lifetime , but after his death there was a reaction against them . His Irish Melodies are set to the traditional musical airs of Ireland . They are graceful , and adapt themselves admirably to the tunes . Moore , however , lacked the depth and far-ranging strength of Burns , and so he failed to do for Ireland what the Ayrshire poet did for Scotland : he did not raise the national sentiment of Ireland into one of the precious things of // literature . His Lalla Rookh ( 1817 ) is an Oriental romance , written in the Scott-Byron manner then so popular . The poem had an immense success , which has now almost totally faded . It contains an abundance of florid description , but as poetry it is hardly secondrate . Moore 's political satires , such as The Twopenny Postbag ( 1813 ) , The Fudge Family in Paris ( 1818 ) , and Fables for the Holy Alliance ( 1823 ) , are keen and lively , and show his Irish wit at its very best . His prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has taken its place as the standard biography of that poet . It is an able and scholarly piece of work , and is written with much knowledge and sympathy , though it lacks the clear-cut vigour of the masterpieces of Boswell and Lockhart ( see pp. 268 and 358 ) . 3 . Thomas Campbell ( 1777-1844 ) . Campbell was born in Glasgow , of a poor but ancient family . After studying at Glasgow University he became tutor to a private family ; but his Pleasures of ( lope ( 1799 ) brought him fame , and he adopted the career of a poet . He visited the Continent , and saw much of the turmoil that there reigned . Returning , he settled in London , where he was editor of The New Monthly Magazine from 1820 to 1830 . His longer poems are quite numerous , and begin with the Pleasures of Hope , which consists of a series of descriptions of nature in heroic couplets , written in a style that suggests Goldsmith . Other longer poems include Gertrude of Wyoming ( 1809 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanzas , and The Pilgrim of Glencoe ( 1842 ) . Campbell , however , is chiefly remembered for his stirring songs , some of which were written during his early Continental tour and were published in newspapers . His most successful are Ye Mariners of England and The Battle of the Baltic , which are spirited without containing the bluster and boasting that so often disfigure the patriotic song . 4 . Samuel Rogers ( 1763-1855 ) . Rogers was born at Stoke Newington , the son of a rich banker . He soon became a partner in his father 's firm , and for the rest of his life his financial success was assured . His chief interest lay in art and poetry , which he cultivated in an earnest fashion . He was a generous patron of the man of letters , and was acquainted with most of the literary people of the time . His breakfasts were famous . His The Pleasures of Memory ( 1792 ) is a reversion to the typical eighteenth-century manner , and as such is interesting . He could compose polished verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works // are Columbus ( 1812 ) , Jacqueline ( 1814 ) , a tale in the Byronic manner , and Italy ( 1822 ) , of which a second part appeared in 1828 . Rogers was a careful and fastidious writer , but his excellence does not go much further . His name is a prominent one in the literary annals of the time , but his wealth rather than his merit accounts for this . 5 . Leigh Hunt ( 1784-1859 ) , unlike Rogers , was not a wealthy amateur who could trifle for years with mediocre production ; he was of the arena , taking and giving hard knocks in both political and literary scuffles . He was born in Middlesex , educated at Christ 's Hospital , and while still in his teens became a journalist , and remained a journalist all his life . His Radical journal The Examiner ( 1808 ) was strongly critical of the Government , and Hunt 's aptitude for abuse landed him in prison for two years . His captivity , as he gleefully records , made a hero of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves upon their Liberalism ? among them being Wordsworth , Byron , Moore , Keats , and Shelley ? sought his friendship . Hunt had a powerful influence on Keats , and published some of the latter 's shorter poems in The Examiner . He tried various other journalistic ventures , but none of them had the success of The Examiner , though The Indicator ( 1819 ) contained some of his finest essays ; his attempted collaboration in journalism with Byron was a lamentable failure . He died , like Wordsworth and others , a respectable pensioner of the Government he had once so strongly condemned . Hunt does not rank highly as a poet , though , in his own day , his work was very popular . Too often his poems are trivial , and most , if not all , are marred by lapses of taste or slipshod workmanship . His best long poem , The Story of Rimini ( 1816 ) , is an Italian tale modelled on Dante 's lines on Paolo and Francesca , and is quite well told in easy , facile couplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looseness of some of its verse , but it is of peculiar interest because its style was the model for Keats 's Endymion . Hunt is seen at his best in his shorter pieces , such as his sonnet on The Nile and Abou Ben Adhem , where he retains all his usual ease and has less opportunity for his too frequent lapses . His chief importance as a poet is , however , historical . In his love of a good story free from didacticism , and in his unrestrained revelling in beauty and the riches of the imagination , he is a definite contributory force in the march away from the eighteenth century and toward the age of romance . // His prose includes an enormous amount of journalistic matter , which was occasionally collected and issued in book form . Such was his Men , Women , and Books ( 1847 ) . His Autobiography ( 1850 ) contains much interesting biographical and literary gossip . He is an agreeable essayist , fluent and easygoing ; his critical opinions are solid and sensible , though often half-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1832 ) , and a very readable book on London called The Town ( 1848 ) . Hunt is not a genius , but he is a useful and amiable second-rate writer . 6 . James Hogg ( 1770-1835 ) . Hogg became known to the world as " the Ettrick Shepherd , " for he was born of a shepherd 's family in the valley of the Ettrick , in Selkirkshire . He was a man of much natural ability , and from his infancy was an eager listener to the songs and ballads of his district . He was introduced to Walter Scott ( 1802 ) while the latter was collecting the Border minstrelsy , and by Scott he was supported both as a literary man and as a farmer . Many of his admirers assisted him in the acquisition of a sheep-farm , but Hogg proved to be a poor farmer . He was known to most of the members of the Scottish literary circle , but his shiftless and unmanageable disposition alienated most of his friends . He died in his native district . Hogg had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of his poetry is very poor indeed . Sometimes , however , his native talent prevails , and he writes such poems as Bonny Kilmeny and When the Kye comes Hame . The latter is a lyric resembling those of Burns in its humour and simple appeal . The former was one of a series of songs and lays , modelled on the lays of Sir Walter Scott , which made up The Queen 's Wake ( 1813 ) , the work which established Hogg 's poetic reputation . In it he achieves what is commonly held to be the true Celtic note : the eerie description of elves and the gloaming , and murmuring and musical echoes of things half seen and half understood . He has also to his credit a number of vigorous Jacobite war songs , of which the best known is Lock the door , Lariston . Some of his books are The Forest Minstrel ( 1810 ) , a volume of songs , of which the majority were by him and the rest by his friends , and The Brownie of Bodsbeck ( 1818 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1781-1849 ) . Elliott was born at Masborough , in Yorkshire , and worked as an iron-founder . The struggles of the poor , oppressed by the Corn Laws , were early borne in upon him , and his poetical gift was used in a fierce challenge to // the existing system . Like Crabbe , he devoted himself to the cause of the poor ; and it is a tribute to his merit as a poet that , in spite of his bristling assertiveness , he produced some work of real value . He became known as the Corn Law Rhymer , ' and he lived to set the abolition of the laws that he had always attacked . His best book is Corn Law Rhymes ( 1828 ) , which includes the powerful and sombre Battle-song . This poem is a kind of anthem for the poor , and breathes a spirit of fierce unrest . 8 . Felicia Hemans ( 1793-1835 ) . Mrs Hemans 's maiden name was Browne , and she was born at Liverpool . Later she removed to Wales , where a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to write poetry , and persisted in the habit all her life . She married somewhat unhappily , but she lived to be a highly popular poetess , and produced a large amount of work . She died in Dublin . Nobody can call Mrs Hemans a great poetess , but her verses are facile and fairly melodious , and she can give simple themes a simple setting . One can respect the genuine quality of her emotions , and the zeal with which she expressed them . Some of her better lyrics ? for example , The Homes of England , The Graves of a Household , and The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England ? are in their limited fashion well done . 9 . Thomas Hood ( 1799-1845 ) . Hood was a native of London , the son of a partner in a book-selling firm . He took to a literary career , and contributed to many periodicals , including The London Magazine . For a time he edited The New Monthly Magazine , but he was much troubled by illness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vein of Spenser and Keats , and Hero and Leander , The Two Swans , and The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies ( 1827 ) have something of the sensuous richness of their models . It was , however , with a collection of humorous verse , published under the title of Whims and Oddities ( 1826 and 1827 ) , that he first gained notoriety , and he did not afterwards return to the earlier experiments . To modern taste the humour is rather cheap , for it consists largely of verbal quibblings , such as the free use of the pun . It seemed to be acceptable to the public of the time , for the book had much success . Other volumes in the same vein were The Comic Annual ( 1830 ) , Up the Rhine ( 1840 ) , and Whimsicalities ( 1844 ) . Hood , in spite of his cleverness , could not keep free of vulgarity , and his wit often jars . In direct contrast to his comic poems were those tragic works of a tearful intensity , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and his horror poems , which dealt with subjects akin to those of the Radcliffian horror novel . The best known of this latter type are The Haunted House and The Dream of Eugene Aram ( 1829 ) . In both kinds Hood 's work suffers from a lack of restraint and a certain crudity of taste . He was also responsible for a number of pieces of social verse such as The Song of the Shirt , first published in Punch in 1843 , in an attempt to help the sweated sempstress of his day , and for a few really good , serious lyrics , including the well-known Ruth , which rise above the less than mediocre level of so much of his work . 10 . John Clare ( 1793 ? 1864 ) was a true peasant poet , and in his day he had a great popularity . After his death his works fell into neglect , but a twentieth-century reissue of his poems , some of them new to the public , has recalled attention to the considerable value of much that he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cripple and a pauper . At the age of thirteen he saved sufficient money to buy a copy of The Seasons , which fired his poetic ability . His first publication , Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery ( 1820 ) , was much praised , but later collections , The Village Minstrel ( 1821 ) , The Shepherd 's Calendar ( 1827 ) , and The Rural Muse ( 1835 ) , had not the same success . The patronage of rich admirers put him above poverty , but a tendency to insanity developed , and , like Christopher Smart , he died in a madhouse . Clare 's poems are seen at their best when they deal with simple rustic themes , and then they are quite charming . He rejoices in the ways of animals and insects . He is not a great poet , but there are many poets with flaunting credentials who have less claims to consideration than he . 11 . James Smith ( 1775 ? 1839 ) and Horace Smith ( 1779-1849 ) , two brothers , collaborated in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period . This book was Rejected Addresses ( I 812 ) . When the Drury Lane Theatre was burned down and rebuilt the management offered a prize for the best poem to be recited on the opening night . The Smiths hit on the idea of making parodies of the notable poets of the time and pretending that they were the rejected entries of the writers mentioned . The result is the classical collection of parodies in English . Scott , Wordsworth , and other well-known authors are imitated , usually with much cleverness . The Wordsworth poem is recited by Nancy Lake , a girl of eight , who is drawn upon the stage in a perambulator : // My brother Jack was nine in May , And I was eight on New Year 's Day ; So in Kate Wilson 's shop Papa ( he 's my papa and Jack 's ) Bought me , last week , a doll of wax , And brother Jack a top . 12 . William Cullen Bryant ( 1794-1878 ) is the first American poet of more than passing fame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took to literature . At an early age he wrote poetry , his first volume being The Embargo ( 1808 ) . His most famous works are Thanatopsis ( 1817 ) , a poetical meditation on death , and The Ages ( 1821 ) . An English edition of his volume of 1832 was published by Washington Irving in the same year . Bryant models much of his poetry on that of Wordsworth , but he lacks the faculty of fervent self-revelation which distinguishes the latter 's nature poetry . He is really in the classical tradition of the eighteenth century , restrained and always serious in outlook . His style is marked by its purity , dignity , precision , and evenness of flow . Bryant 's verse has its own meditative beauty , and some of his shorter pieces ? for example , To a Waterfowl ? are of real distinction . His descriptive passages dealing with North America were highly appreciated by his English readers . NOVELISTS I. SIR WALTER SCOTT ( 1771-1832 ) 1 . His Life . Scott was born in Edinburgh , of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen months he was crippled for life by a childish ailment ; and though he grew up to be a man of great physical robustness he never lost his lameness . He was educated at the High School of Edinburgh and at the university ; and there he developed that powerful memory which , though it rejected things of no interest to it , held in tenacious grasp a great store of miscellaneous knowledge . His father was a lawyer , and Scott himself was called to the Scottish Bar ( 1792 ) . As a pleader he had little success , for he was much more interested in the lore and antiquities of the country . He was glad , therefore , to accept a small legal appointment as Sheriff of Selkirkshire ( 1799 ) . Just before this , after an unsuccessful love-affair with a Perthshire lady , he had married the daughter of a French exile . In 1806 he obtained the valuable post of Clerk of Session , but for six years he received no salary , as the post was still held by an invalid nominally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his first salary as Clerk of Session , he removed from his pleasant home of Ashiestiel to Abbotsford , a small estate near Melrose . For the place he paid ? 4000 , which he characteristically obtained half by borrowing and half on security of the poem Rokeby , still unwritten . During the next dozen years he played the laird at Abbotsford , keeping open house , sinking vast sums of money in enlarging his territory , and adorning the house in a manner that was frequently in the reverse of good taste . In 1826 came the crash . In 1802 he had assisted a Border printer , James Ballantyne , to establish a business at Edinburgh . In 1805 Scott became secretly a partner . As a printing firm the concern was a fair success ; but in an evil moment , in 1809 , Scott , with another brother , John Ballantyne , started a publishing business . The new firm was poorly managed from the beginning ; in 1814 it was only the publication of Waverley that kept it on its legs , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity ? for the time . Then John Ballantyne , a reckless fellow , plunged heavily into further commitments , which entailed great loss ; Scott in his easy fashion also drew heavily upon the firm 's funds ; and in 1826 the whole erection tumbled into ruin . With great courage and sterling honesty Scott refused to take the course that the other principals accepted naturally , and compound with his creditors . Instead he attempted what turned out to be the impossible task of paying the debt and surviving it . His liabilities amounted to ? 117,000 , and before he died he had cleared off ? 70,000 . After his death the remainder was made good , chiefly from the proceeds of Lockhart 's Life , and his creditors were paid in full . The gigantic efforts he made brought about his death . He had a slight paralytic seizure in 1830 . It passed , but it left him with a clouded brain . He refused to desist from novel-writing , or even to slacken the pace . Other illness followed , his early lameness becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Abbotsford , and died within sound of the river he loved so well . 2 . His Poetry . Scott 's earliest poetical efforts were translations from the German . Lenore ( 1796 ) , the most considerable of them , Is crude enough , but it has much of his later vigour and clatter . In 1802 appeared the first two volumes of The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border , to be followed by a third volume in the next year . In some respects the work is a compilation of old material ; but Scott patched up the ancient pieces when it was necessary , and added some original // poems of his own , which were done in the ancient manner . The best of his own contributions , such as The Eve of St John , have a strong infusion of the ancient force and fire , as well as a grimly supernatural element . In The Lay of the Last Minstrel ( 1805 ) there is much more originality . The work is a poem of considerable length written in the Christabel metre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seeks shelter in the castle of Newark . As a tale the poem is confused and difficult ; as poetry it is mediocre ; but the abounding vitality of the style , the fresh and intimate local knowledge , and the healthy love of nature made it a revelation to a public anxious to welcome the new Romantic methods . The poem was a great and instant success , and was quickly followed up with Marmion ( 1808 ) . In popular estimation Marmion is held to be Scott 's masterpiece . The story deals with Flodden Field , and is intricate in detail , as Scott labours to obtain a denouement . For several cantos the tale is cumbered with the masses o1 antiquarian and topical matter with which Scott 's mind was fully charged . Once the narrative is within touch of Flodden it quickens considerably . The passage dealing with the close of the battle is one of the triumphs of martial verse : But as they left the dark'ning heath , More desperate grew the strife of death . The English shafts in volleys hail 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flank , and rear , the squadrons sweep To break the Scottish circle deep , That fought around their King . But yet , though thick the shafts as snow , Though charging knights like whirlwinds go , Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow , Unbroken was the ring ; The stubborn spear-men still made good Their dark impenetrable wood , Each stepping where his comrade stood , The instant that he fell . No thought was there of dastard flight ; Link 'd in the serried phalanx tight , Groom fought like noble , squire like knight As fearlessly and well ; Till utter darkness closed her wing O'er their thin host and wounded King . . . . Next came The Lady of the Lake ( 1810 ) , which was a still greater success . It has all Scott 's usual picturesqueness , and makes particularly effective use of the wild scenery of the Trossachs . It is // crammed with incident and free from the rather wearying digressions of the earlier lays . Without rising to the heights of great poetry , it has considerable vigour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Rokeby ( 1813 ) the scene shifts to the North of England . As a whole this poem is inferior to its predecessors , but some of the lyrics have a seriousness and depth of tone that are quite uncommon in the spur-and-feather pageantry of Scott 's verse . The Bridal of Triermain ( 1813 ) and The Lord of the Isles ( 1814 ) mark a decline in quality . In addition to these longer poems Scott composed many lyrics , some of which are found in the lays , others in his novels , and some of which were contributed to magazines and similar publications . Though his lyrical note is on occasion uncertain , these poems are generally of a more sustained quality than his narrative work , and , to modern tastes , Scott is here seen at his best . One eminent critic has even gone so far as to describe him as the chief lyrical poet between Burns or Blake and Shelley . Though he is no love poet , he successfully handles a wide variety of subjects , from the hearty gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the martial ardour of Pibroch of Donuil Dhu or the moving , elegiac sadness of Proud Maisie . It is in this last type that he touches on something deeper and finer which provides us with his best lyrics . He is gone on the mountain , He is lost to the forest , Like a summer-dried fountain , When our need was the sorest . The font re-appearing From the rain-drops shall borrow ; But to us comes no cheering , To Duncan no morrow ! The hand of the reaper Takes ears that are hoary But the voice of the weeper Wails manhood in glory . The Autumn winds rushing , Waft the leaves that are searest , But our flower was in flushing , When blighting was nearest . Fleet foot on the correi , Sage counsel in cumber , Red hand in the foray , How sound is thy slumber ! // Like the dew on the mountain , Like the foam on the river , Like the bubble on the fountain , Thou art gone , and for ever ! Coronae As a narrative poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , his lyrical qualities have more recently been acclaimed . Of his narratives it may be said that his faults , like his merits , are all on the surface : he lacks the finer poetical virtues , such as reflection , melody , and delicate sympathy ; he ( in poetry ) is deficient in humour ; he records crude physical action simply portrayed . Even the vigour that is often ascribed to him exists fitfully , for he loads his narrative with over-abundant detail , often of a technical kind . When he does move freely he has the stamp , the rattle , and the swing of martial music . One must nevertheless do credit to the service he did to poetry by giving new zest to the Romantic methods that had already been adopted in poetry . 3 . His Prose . About 1814 Scott largely gave up writing poetry , and save for short pieces , mainly in the novels , wrote no more in verse . As he confessed in the last year of his life , Byron had bet ' him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own . In 1814 Scott returned to a fragment of a Jacobite prose romance that he had started and left unfinished in 1805 . He left the opening chapters as they stood , and on to them tacked a rapid and brilliant narrative dealing with the Forty-five . This made the novel Waverley , which was issued anonymously in 1814 . Owing chiefly to its ponderous and lifeless beginning , the book hung fire for a space ; but the remarkable remainder was almost bound to make it a success . After Waverley Scott went on from strength to strength : Guy Mannering ( 1815 ) , The Antiquary ( 1816 ) , The Black Dwarf ( 1816 ) , Old Mortality ( 1816 ) , Rob Roy ( 1818 ) , The Heart of Midlothian ( 1818 ) , The Bride of Lammermoor ( 1819 ) , and A Legend of Montrose ( 1819 ) . All these novels deal with scenes in Scotland , but not all with historical Scotland . They are not of equal merit , and the weakest is The Black Dwarf . Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the scene of which is Plantagenet England ; then turned again to Scotland and suffered failure with The Monastery ( 1820 ) , though he triumphantly rehabilitated himself with The Abbot ( 1820 ) , a sequel to the last . Henceforth he ranged abroad or stayed at home as he fancied in Kenilworth ( 1821 ) , The Pirate ( 1822 ) , The Fortunes of Nigel ( 1822 ) , // Peveril of the Peak ( 1823 ) , Quentin Durward ( 1823 ) , St Ronan 's Well ( 1824 ) , Redgauntlet ( 1824 ) , The Betrothed ( 1825 ) , and The Talisman ( 1825 ) . By this time such enormous productivity was telling even on his gigantic powers . In the latter books the narrative is often heavier , the humour more cumbrous , and the descriptions more laboured . Then came the financial deluge , and Scott began a losing battle against misfortune and disease . But even yet the odds were not too great for him : for in succession appeared Woodstock ( 1826 ) , The Fair Maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1829 ) , Count Robert of Paris ( 1832 ) , and Castle Dangerous ( 1832 ) . The last works were dictated from the depths of mental and bodily anguish , and the furrows of mind and brow are all over them . Yet frequently the old spirit revives and the ancient glory is renewed . It should never be forgotten that along with these literary labours Scott was filling the office of Clerk of Session , was laboriously performing the duties of a Border laird , and was compiling a mass of miscellaneous prose . Among this last are his editions of Dryden ( 1808 ) and Swift ( 1814 ) , heavy tasks in themselves ; the Lives of the Novelists ( 1821 ? 24 ) ; the Life of Napoleon ( 1827 ) , a gigantic work that cost him more labour than ten novels ; and the admirable Tales of a Grandfather ( 1828 ? 30 ) . His miscellaneous articles , pamphlets , journals , and letters are a legion in themselves . 4 . Features of his Novels . ( a ) Rapidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some positive evils , the greatest of which was a too great haste in the composition of his stories . His haphazard financial methods , which often led to his drawing upon future profits , also tended to over-production . Haste is visible in the construction of his plots , which are frequently hurriedly improvised , developed carelessly , and finished anyhow . As for his style , it is spacious and ornate , but he has little ear for rhythm and melody , and his sentences are apt to be shapeless . The same haste is seen in the handling of his characters , which sometimes finish weakly after they have begun strongly . An outstanding case of this is Mike Lambourne in Kenilworth . It is doubtful if Scott would have done any better if he had taken greater pains . He himself admitted , and to a certain extent gloried In , his slapdash methods . So he must stand the inevitable criticisms that arise when his methods are examined . ( b ) His contribution to the novel is very great indeed . To the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact , but manageable , wide , and bountiful . To the sum of this knowledge he added a life-giving force , a vitalizing energy , an insight , and a genial dexterity that made the historical novel an entirely new species . Earlier historical novels , such as Clara Reeve 's Old English Baron ( 1777 ) and Miss Porter 's The Scottish Chiefs ( 1810 ) , had been lifeless productions ; but in the hands of Scott the historical novel became of the first importance , so much so that for a generation after his time it was done almost to death . It should also be noted that he did much to develop the domestic novel , which had several representatives in the Waverley series , such as Guy Mannering and The Antiquary . To this type of fiction he added freshness , as well as his broad and sane handling of character and incident . ( c ) His Shakespearian Qualities . Scott has often been called the prose Shakespeare , and in several respects the comparison is fairly just . He resembles Shakespeare in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left , in his search for material . On the other hand , in his character-drawing he lacks much of the Elizabethan 's deep penetration . His villains are often melodramatic and his heroes and heroines wooden and dull . His best figures are either Lowland Scots of the middle and lower classes or eccentrics , whose idiosyncrasies are skilfully kept within bounds . He has much of Shakespeare 's genial , tolerant humour , in which he strongly resembles also his great predecessor Fielding . It is probably in this large urbanity that the resemblance to Shakespeare is observed most strongly . ( d ) His Style . The following extract will give some idea of Scott 's style at its best . It lacks suppleness , but it is powerful , solid , and sure . In his use of the Scottish vernacular he is exceedingly natural and vivacious . His characters who employ the Scottish dialect , such as Cuddie Headrigg or Jeanie Deans , owe much of their freshness and attraction to Scott 's happy use of their native speech : Fergus , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placed his own bonnet upon his head , regarded him with a steadfast and stern look , and replied in a firm voice : " I can not let this numerous audience suppose that to such an appeal I have no answer to make . But what I have to say you would not bear to hear , for my defence would be your condemnation . Proceed , then , in the name of God , to do what is permitted to you . Yesterday and the day before you have condemned loyal and honourable blood to be poured forth like water . Spare not mine . Were that // of all my ancestors in my veins , I would have perilled it in this quarrel . " He resumed his seat , and refused again to rise . Evan Maccombich looked at him with great earnestness , and , rising up , seemed anxious to speak ; but the confusion of the court and the perplexity arising from thinking in a language different from that in which he was to express himself , kept him silent . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the poor fellow intended to plead the influence of his superior as an excuse for his crime . The judge commanded silence , and encouraged Evan to proceed . " I was only ganging to say , my lord , " said Evan , in what he meant to be an insinuating manner , " that if your excellent Honour and the honourable court would let Vich Ian Vohr go free just this once , and let him gae back to France , and no to trouble King George 's government again , that ony six o ' the very best of his clan will be willing to be justified in his stead ; and if you 'll just let me gae down to Glennaquoich , I 'll fetch them up to ye mysell , to head or hang , and you may begin wi ' me the very first man . " Waverley II . JANE AUSTEN ( 1775 ? 1817 ) 1 . Her Life . Jane Austen , the daughter of a Hampshire clergyman , was born at Steventon . She was educated at home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of reading material , and Jane 's education was conducted on sound lines . Her life was unexciting , being little more than a series of pilgrimages to different places of residence , including the fashionable resort of Bath ( 1801 ) . On the death of the rector his wife and two daughters removed to the neighbourhood of Southampton , where the majority of Jane Austen 's novels were written . Her first published works were issued anonymously , and she died in middle age , before her merits had received anything like adequate recognition . 2 . Her Novels . The chronology of Jane Austen 's novels is not easy to follow , for her works were not published in their order of composition . Her first novel was Pride and Prejudice ( 1796-97 ) , published 1813 ) . In it , as in all her works , we have middle-class people pursuing the common round . The heroine is a girl of spirit , but she has no extraordinary qualities ; her prejudice and the pride of rank and wealth arc gently but pleasingly titillated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carefully selected intensity . The style is smooth and unobtrusive , but covers a delicate pricking of irony that is agreeable and masterly in its quiet way . Nothing quite like it had appeared before in the novel . In unobtrusive and dexterous art the book is considered to be her masterpiece . // Sense and Sensibility ( 1797-98 , published 1811 ) was her second novel , and it followed the same general lines as its predecessor . It was followed by Northanger Abbey ( 1798 , published posthumously t818 ) . The book begins as a burlesque of the Radcliffian horror novel , which was then all the rage . The heroine , after a visit to Bath , is invited to an abbey , where she imagines romantic possibilities , but is in the end ludicrously undeceived . The incidents of the novel are commonplace and the characters flatly average . Yet the treatment is deft and touched with the finest needle-point of satiric observation . Between 1798 and 1811 there was a pause in her writing , but then followed in quick succession her other three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Emma ( 1815 , published 1816 ) , and Persuasion ( 1815-16 , published 1818 ) . The novels of this latter group are of the same type as the earlier ones ; if there is any development it is seen in the still more inflexible avoidance of anything that is unusual or startling . Jane Austen 's novels are all much the same , yet subtly and artistically different . 3 . Features of her Novels . ( a ) Her Plots . Her skilfully constructed plots are severely unromantic . Her first work , beginning as a burlesque of the horrible in fiction , finishes by being an excellent example of her ideal novel . As her art develops , even the slight casualties of common life ? such an incident , for example , as the elopement that appears in Pride and Prejudice ? become rarer ; with the result that the later novels , such as Emma , are the pictures of everyday existence . Life in her novels is governed by an easy decorum , and moments of fierce passion , or even deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such plots attractive , and Jane Austen 's does so . ( b ) Her characters are developed with minuteness and accuracy . They are ordinary people , but are convincingly alive . She is fond of introducing clergymen , all of whom strike the reader as being exactly like clergymen , though each has his own individual characteristics . She has many characters of the first class , like the servile Mr Collins in Pride and Prejudice , the garrulous Miss Bates in i Emma , and the selfish and vulgar John Thorpe in Northanger Abbey . Her characters are not types , but individuals . Her method of portrayal is based upon acute observation and a quiet but incisive irony . Her male characters have a certain softness of thew and temper , but her female characters are almost unexceptionable in perfection of finish . // ( c ) Her place in the history of fiction is remarkable . Her qualities are of a kind that are slow to be recognized , for there is nothing loud or garish to catch the casual glance . The taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it is acquired it remains strong . Jane Austen has won her way to a foremost place , and she will surely keep it . We add a short extract to illustrate her clear and careful style , her skill in handling conversation , and the quiet irony of her method . ( Catherine Morland , the heroine of the novel , is introduced to the society of Bath , where she cuts rather a lonely figure till she meets a young man called Tilney ? " not quite handsome , but very near it . " The following is part of their conversation at a dance . ) After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them , he suddenly addressed her with ? " I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ? If you are I will begin directly . " " You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . " " No trouble , I assure you , madam . " Then forming his features into a set smile , and affectedly softening his voice , he added , with a simpering air , " Have you been long in Bath , madam ? " " About a week , sir , " replied Catherine , trying not to laugh . " Really ! " with affected astonishment . " Why should you be surprised , sir ? " " Why , indeed ? " said he , in his natural tone ; " but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable , than any other. ? Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? " " Never , sir . " " Indeed ! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have you been to the theatre ? " " Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . " " To the concert ? " " Yes , sir , on Wednesday . " " And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? " " Yes ? I like it very well . " " Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . " Northanger Abbey // OTHER NOVELISTS 1 . Maria Edgeworth ( 1767 ? 1849 ) was born in Oxfordshire , but , after her earliest years , spent most of an uneventful life in Ireland . Her books are numerous but are to-day little read , though they enjoyed great popularity in her own day . They fall into three classes , short stories for children , such as Simple Susan , which were collected in The Parent 's Assistant ( 1795 ? 1800 ) and Early Lessons ( 1801 ? 15 ) ; Irish tales , which include her best works , Castle Rackrent ( 1800 ) , The Absentee ( 1809 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Belinda ( 1801 ) , Leonora ( 1806 ) , Patronage ( 1814 ) , and Harrington ( 1817 ) . With the solitary exception of her finest book , Castle Rackrent , in which she kept her moral purpose in the background , all her writings are marred by her overmastering didactic urge . This results in an over-simplification of life and of character in order to show clearly the inevitable triumph of virtue . Yet her children 's stories show a fine understanding of , and sympathy with , the outlook of children , and her Irish tales are notable for a level-headed , accurate , and vivid portrayal of many levels of Irish life , and the creation of such fine characters as King Corny , in Ormond , or Thady , in Castle Rackrent . Her field is the limited domestic circle also explored by Jane Austen , and , like the latter she writes in simple , unaffected style . Sir Walter Scott declared that her tales of Irish life inspired his attempt to do something similar for Scotland . 2 . John Galt ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he passed the early years of his life , afterward removing to Greenock . After spending some years as a clerk , he moved to London to read for the Bar , but he abandoned his studies to take up a business appointment abroad . After much travelling he settled in Scotland , and produced a large amount of literary work . He engaged unsuccessfully in business transactions , then took once more to writing novels and to journalism . He died at Greenock , where his career had commenced . The best of his novels are The Ayrshire Legatees ; or , the Pringle Family ( 1821 ) , in the form of a letter-series , containing much amusing Scottish narrative ; The Annals of the Parish ( 1821 ) , his masterpiece , which is the record of a fictitious country minister , doing in prose very much what Crabbe had done in verse ; The Provost ( 1822 ) ; and The Entail ; or , the Lairds of Grippy ( 1823 ) . Galt had a vigorous style and abundant imagination , with a great // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haphazard and uneven to be a great novelist , though he has value as a painter of Scottish manners , and his portraits are masterly in their terseness and power of self-revelation. 3 . William Harrison Ainsworth ( 1805-82 ) , the son of a solicitor , was born at Manchester , where he was educated at the grammar school . After some attempt to study law he took to literature as a career . He tried publishing without success , and then , in 1840 , became editor of Bentley 's Miscellany . In 1853 he acquired The New Monthly Magazine . He died at Reigate . An early imitator of Scott , Ainsworth wrote a great number of novels , which cover many periods of English history . The first was Sir John Chiverton ( 1826 ) , written in collaboration with John Aston , but his great success was scored with Rook wood ( 1834 ) . A few of the many others were Jack Sheppard ( 1839 ) , an immense success , The Tower of London ( 1840 ) , Old St Paul 's ( 1841 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber ( 1854 ) , The Constable of the Tower ( 1861 ) , and Preston Fight , or the Insurrection of 1715 ( 1875 ) . Ainsworth possesses little of Scott 's genius , for his handling of historical material is crude and cavalier in the extreme . His brutal realism and crude sensationalism give his work a melodramatic effect similar to that of the Radcliffian horror novel . His characterization is poor and his style unpolished , but when he is in the right vein he can give the reader a vigorous narrative , seen , perhaps , at its best in his account of Turpin 's ride to York in Rook wood . 4 . George P. R. James ( 1801 ? 60 ) was another follower of the method of Scott , and he was responsible for a hundred and eightynine volumes , chiefly novels . He was born in London ; travelled abroad ; settled down to novel-writing ; on the strength of some serious historical work was appointed Historiographer Royal ; entered the Consular Service ; and died at Venice . Richelieu . A Tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to Quentin Durward , was his earliest , and is by many considered to be his best , novel . Others include Darnley , or the Field of the Cloth of Gold ( 1830 ) , De l'Orme ( 1830 ) , The Gipsey ( 1835 ) , and Lord Montagu 's Page ( 1858 ) . As was almost inevitable with such mass-production , he makes his novels on a stock pattern . He is fond of florid pageantry , and can be rather ingeniously mysterious in his plots . He has little power in dealing with his characters , and no imaginative grasp of history . In style he is pompous and monotonous , and his dialogue is stilted and formal . // S. Charles Lever ( 1806 ? 72 ) . Lever was born in Dublin , was educated at Trinity College and Gottingen , and became a physician . The success of his novels caused him to desert his profession , and in the course of time ( 1842 ) he became editor of The Dublin University Magazine , which had published his first stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul in Spezia ( 1857 ) , and after some other changes died when consul at Trieste . The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer ( 1839 ) , his first novel , made a great hit . It is a novel of the picaresque type , dealing with the adventures of the hare-brained but lovable hero . Charles O'Malley , the Irish Dragoon ( 1841 ) , is of the same species , and others are Jack Hinton and Tom Burke of Ours , ' which appeared together ( 1843 ? 44 ) as Our Mess . All these novels are either set in Ireland or deal with Irish characters . There is little plot , what there is consisting of the scrapes of the heroes ; the humour is rough-and-tumble , though agreeably lively ; and the heroes , who are all much the same , are amiable fellows , with a propensity for falling into trouble and falling out of it . A later class of Lever 's novels was more of the historical cast , and includes The O'Donoghue ( 1845 ) and The Knight of Gwynne ( 1847 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dodd Family Abroad ( 1852 ? 54 ) and The Fortunes of Glencore ( 1857 ) . These latter are more stable and serious , but , though they are more careful in structure and finished in style , Lever lacked the necessary depth of insight to deal adequately with serious social topics , and we miss the racy , spirited tone of his earlier and more typical picaresque novels . 6 . Frederick Marryat ( 1792 ? 1848 ) followed the Smollett tradition of writing sea-stories . He was born in London , entered the Navy at an early age ( 1806 ) , and saw some fighting during the Napoleonic Wars . He saw further service in different parts of the world , rose to be a captain , and spent much of his later life writing the novels that have given him his place in literature . His earliest novel was The Naval Officer ; or Scenes and Adventures in the Life of Frank Mildmay ( 1829 ) , a loose and disconnected narrative , which was followed by The King 's Own ( 1830 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point he continued to produce fiction at a great rate . The best of his stories are Jacob Faithful ( 1834 ) , Peter Simple ( 1834 ) , Japhet in Search of a Father ( 1836 ) , Mr Midshipman Easy ( 1836 ) , and Masterman Ready ( 1841-42 ) . All his best books deal with the sea , and have much of its breeziness . Marryat has a considerable gift for plain narrative , and his // humour , though it is often coarse , is entertaining . His characters are of the stock types , but they are lively and suit his purpose , which is to produce a good yarn . 7 . Michael Scott ( 1789 ? 1835 ) was another novelist whose favourite theme was the sea . Scott was not a sailor like Marryat , but a merchant , first in Jamaica and then in his native city of Glasgow . His two tales , Tom Cringle 's Log and The Cruise of the Midge , were published in Blackwood 's Magazine ( 1829-33 ) . As picaresque novels they are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions in which Scott captures the beauty and magic of the sea . But they can not rank among the best , for most of the characters are grotesque , and the stories are full of violent sensation and horseplay. 8 . Thomas Love Peacock ( 1785-1866 ) , the son of a London merchant , was born at Weymouth . He was privately educated , and unsuccessfully tried a number of clerical and business posts before joining the East India Company in 1819 . A very efficient servant of this company , he was chief examiner between 1836 and 1856 . In 1812 he had met Shelley , with whom he maintained a close friendship until the latter 's death . His fame rests upon his novels rather than upon his verse , though the songs which he scattered through his novels are extremely good . His early verses , such as Palmyra , and Other Poems ( 1806 ) , The Genius of the Thames ( 1810 ) , and The Philosophy of Melancholy ( 1812 ) lack the finish of his later lyrics , but Rhododaphne ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothness . He wrote seven novels , Headlong Hall ( 1816 ) , Melincourt ( 1817 ) , Nightmare Abbey ( 1818 ) , Maid Marian ( 1822 ) , The Misfortunes of Elphin ( 1829 ) , Crotchet Castle ( 1831 ) , and Gryll Grange ( 1860 ) . None of them has a plot really worthy of the name , though all contain well-recounted incidents . In varying degrees , they are the vehicle for his ironical and satirical attacks on the cranks and fads of his day . His favourite butt was the contemporary cult of romanticism and all who practised it . Wordsworth , as Mr Paperstamp of Mainchance Villa , Coleridge , as Mr Flosky , Shelley , as Mr Scythrop , Byron , as Mr Cypress , and many others were all caricatured with telling skill . No contemporary idea , from paper money to modern science , escaped his pen . The novels consist mainly of discussions phrased in a concise , polished , scholarly style , full of wit and pointed satire , in which characters embodying contemporary ideas dissect themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the best known is The War Song of Dinas Vawr . Peacock 's The Four Ages of Poetry , in which his own age is classed as the age of brass , " the second childhood of poetry , " is in the familiar mocking , ironical style of the novels . Its only importance lies in the fact that it drew from Shelley his famous The Defence of Poetry . 9 . Washington Irving ( 1783-4859 ) was the first American novelist to establish a European reputation . He was called to the Bar , but his real bent was literary . His life was that of a busy man of letters , varied with much travelling in Europe and America . His works were admired by Scott , who did much to popularize them on this side of the Atlantic . His History of New York ( 1809 ) was the comic history of an imaginary Dutchman called Knickerbocker . The humour now appears strained and overdone , but the book is written with ease and grace . His The Sketch-book ( 1820 ) brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of short tales and sketches , the two favourites , those of Rip van Winkle and of Sleepy Hollow , being the best of his productions . It was followed by Bracebridge Hall ( 1822 ) , a series of sketches of the life of the English squirearchy , done in the Addisonian manner . His later travels helped him in the writing of Tales of a Traveller ( 1824 ) , Legends of the Alhambra ( 1832 ) , and other works . As a story-teller Irving lacks animation and fire , but his humour in the later books is facile , though thin , and his descriptions are sometimes impressive . His style reminds the reader of that of Goldsmith , whose Life ( 1849 ) he wrote . He produced other historical works , such as History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus ( 1828 ) , The Conquest of Granada ( 1829 ) , and his Life of Washington ( 1859 ) , more noteworthy for the ease of their narrative than for their deep learning or insight . 10 . James Fenimore Cooper ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educated at Yale College . He passed his boyhood on an ancestral estate near Lake Otsego , and so gained much material for his Indian works . He was in the Navy for six years , and then retired to write books . He travelled and wrote much . He was a man of acrimonious temper , and his extravagant estimation of his abilities drew him into many quarrels . His first novel , Precaution ( 1820 ) , was a conventional study of society and was of little merit . Then The Spy ( 1821 ) began a series of vigorous adventure stories , some of which , like The Pilot ( 1824 ) // and The Red Rover ( 1828 ) , deal with the sea . Cooper 's technical knowledge and appreciation of the beauty of the sea are here used to advantage , though his characters are stiff . The best of his works , however , are the Leatherstocking novels , which deal with frontier life in Indian territory . They include The Pioneers ( 1823 ) , The Last of the Mohicans ( 1826 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deerslayer ( 1841 ) . Their view of the Indian is romanticized , but they opened up a new field for American fiction , and have plenty of incident and suspense . Cooper set himself up as a rival of Scott , but he has little of Scott 's ability . He lacks humour , his characters are , with rare exceptions such as Leatherstocking , lifeless and unconvincing , and his style is wordy and heavy . But at times he can make his story move rapidly , and he is skilful in his suggestion of the charm and dangers of the primeval forest . Cooper attempted many other forms of literature , including highly controversial novels about Europe , bitter satire , a history of the American Navy , and propagandist attacks on cruelty and oppression . But he wrote too much and too carelessly . He affected to despise popular criticism , but , except for his Indian tales , his work has little permanent value . WRITERS OF MISCELLANEOUS PROSE I. CHARLES LAMB ( 1775-1834 ) 1 . His Life . Lamb was born in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Inner Temple . The boy , who was a timid and retiring youth , was educated at Christ 's Hospital , where he was a fellow-pupil of Coleridge , whose early eccentricities he has touched upon with his usual felicity . He obtained a clerkship first in the South Sea House , then ( 1792 ) in the India House , where the remainder of his working life was spent . There was a strain of madness in the family which did not leave him untouched , for in 1795-96 he was under restraint for a time . In the case of his sister , Mary Lamb , the curse was a deadly one . In September 1796 she murdered her mother in a sudden frenzy , and thereafter she had intermittent attacks of insanity . Lamb devoted his life to the welfare of his afflicted sister , who frequently appears in his essays under the name of Cousin Bridget . After more than thirty years ' service Lamb retired ( 1825 ) on a pension , and the last ten years of his life were passed in blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a delightful talker , and one of the least assuming of writers . His // reputation , based upon his qualities of humour , pathos , and cheery good-will , is unsurpassed in our literature . 2 . His Essays . Lamb started his literary career as a poet , producing short pieces of moderate ability , including the well-known The Old Familiar Faces and To Hester . He attempted a tragedy , John Woodvil ( 1802 ) , in the style of his favourite Elizabethan playwrights , but it had no success on the stage . His Tales from Shakespeare ( 1807 ) , written in collaboration with his sister , are skilfully done , and are agreeable to read . His critical work , the most substantial selection of which is to be found in his Specimens of English Dramatic Poets , who lived about the Time of Shakespeare ( 1808 ) , is remarkable for its delicate insight and good literary taste . His work on the Elizabethan dramatists rescued them from the unmerited oblivion in which they had long rested , and led to a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are of little importance compared with his essays . The first of his essays appeared in The London Magazine in 1820 , when Lamb was forty-five years old . It was signed " Elia , " a name taken almost at random as that of a foreigner , a clerk in the old South Sea House . The original series was published as The Essays of Elia ( 1823 ) , and a second under the title of The Last Essays of Elia ( 1833 ) . The essays are unequalled in English . In subject they are of the usual miscellaneous kind , ranging from chimney-sweeps to old china . They are , however , touched with personal opinions and recollections so oddly obtruded that interest in the subject is nearly swamped by the reader 's delight in the author . No essayist is more egotistical than Lamb ; but no egotist can be so artless and yet so artful , so tearful and yet so mirthful , so pedantic and yet so humane . It is this delicate clashing of humours , like the chiming of sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . It is almost impossible to do justice to his style . It is old-fashioned , bearing echoes and odours from older writers like Sir Thomas Browne and Fuller ; it is full of long and curious words ; and it is dashed with frequent exclamations and parentheses . The humour that runs through it all is not strong , but airy , almost elfish , in note ; it vibrates faintly , but in application never lacks precision . His pathos is of much the same character ; and sometimes , as in DreamChildren , it deepens into a quivering sigh of regret . He is so sensitive and so strong , so cheerful and yet so unalterably doomed to sorrow . // The extract given below deals with the playhouse , which was one of his greatest passions . The reader can easily observe some of the above-mentioned features of his style . In those days were pit orders . Beshrew the uncomfortable manager who abolished them ! ? with one of these we went . I remember the waiting at the door ? not that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter ? O when shall I be such an expectant again ! ? with the cry of nonpareils , an indispensable play-house accompaniment in those days . As near as I can recollect , the fashionable pronunciation of the theatrical fruiteresses then was , " Chase some oranges , chase some numparels , chase a bill of the play " ; ? chase pro chuse . But when we got in , and I beheld the green curtain that veiled a heaven to my imagination , which was soon to be disclosed ? the breathless anticipations I endured ! I had seen something like it in the plate prefixed to Troilus and Cressida , in Rowe 's Shakespeare ? the tent scene with Diomede ? and a sight of that plate can always bring back in a measure the feeling of that evening. ? The boxes at that time , full of well-dressed women of quality , projected over the pit ; and the pilasters reaching down were adorned with a glistering substance ( I know not what ) under glass ( as it seemed ) , resembling ? a homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , to my raised imagination , divested of its homelier qualities , it appeared a glorified candy ! ? The orchestra lights at length arose , those " fair Auroras ! " Once the bell sounded . It was to ring out yet once again ? and , incapable of the anticipation , I reposed my shut eyes in a sort of resignation upon the maternal lap . It rang the second time . The curtain drew up ? I was not past six years old ? and the play was Artaxerxes ! My First Play Every aspect of Lamb 's character and thought is to be found still more clearly revealed in the natural , intimate Letters , which cover the last thirty-eight years of his life . Among his many correspondents were Wordsworth , Coleridge , Southey , and Hazlitt . I l . THOMAS DE QUINCEY ( 1785 ? 1859 ) 1 . His Life . De Quincey was born at Manchester , where his father was a rich merchant . The elder De Quincey left considerable property , but De Quincey himself was improvident and unreliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammar School and then at Oxford . There he studied for a long time ( 1803-08 ) , distinguishing himself by his ability in Greek . While he was an undergraduate ( 1804 ) he first became acquainted with opium , soaking his tobacco in the drug and then smoking it in order to alleviate the pains of neuralgia . His money was always easily spent , and his early struggles were a painful effort to make both ends meet . He earned a precarious livelihood by journalism , and spent the years 1809-30 , for the most part , in the Lake District , becoming intimate with the local literary celebrities . During this time his devotion to the drug was excessive , but he produced a large amount of work . Then , becoming loosely attached to the staff of Blackwood 's Magazine , he removed to Edinburgh . In this neighbourhood he remained till the end of his long life , and was buried in the Scottish capital . 2 . His Works . De Quincey is one of the authors whose work is to be rigorously sifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is hack-work , a fair proportion is of good quality , and a small amount is of the highest merit . He wrote no book of any great length , in this respect resembling another opium-eater , Coleridge . The book that made his name was his Confessions of an English Opium Eater ( 1821 ) , which appeared in The London Magazine . The work , which is chaotic in its general plan , is a series of visions that melt away in the manner of dreams . Much is tawdry and unreal , but the book contains passages of great power and beauty . The remainder of his work is a mass of miscellaneous production , the best of which is The English Mail-coach ( 1849 ) , Suspiria de Profundis ( 1845 ) , and On Murder considered as One of the Fine Arts ( 1827 ; second part , 1839 ) . A great part of his work is dreary and diffuse , and vitiated by a humour that is extremely flat and ineffective . He displays a wide range of knowledge , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to stumble into vulgarity and tawdriness ; but when inspiration descends upon him he gives to the English tongue a wonderful strength and sweetness . In these rare moments he plunges into an elaborate style and imagery , but never loses grip , sweeping along with sureness and ease . In rhythm and melody he is almost supreme ; he can " blow through bronze " and " breathe through silver , " and be impressive in both . The passage we now give is among his most impressive efforts . It has the unity and passion of the lyric , and its effect is both thrilling and profound . Observe the studied rhythm , often ejaculatory , the deep and solemn beauty , and the simplicity of diction . This is poetic prose at its best : As a final specimen , I cite one of a different character , from 1820 . The dream commenced with a music which now I often heard in dreams ? a music of preparation and of awakening suspense ; a // music like the opening of the coronation anthem , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march  --  of infinite cavalcades filing off ? and the tread of innumerable armies . The morning was come of a mighty day ? a day of crisis and of final hope for human nature , then suffering some mysterious eclipse , and labouring in some dread extremity . Somewhere , I knew not where ? somehow , I knew not how ? by some beings , I knew not whom ? a battle , a strife , an agony was conducting ? was evolving like a great drama , or piece of music ; with which my sympathy was the more insupportable from my confusion as to its place , its cause , its nature , and its possible issue . I , as is usual in dreams ( where , of necessity , we make ourselves central to every movement ) , had the power , and yet had not the power , to decide it . I had the power , if 1 could raise myself , to will it ; and yet again had not the power , for the weight of twenty Atlantics was upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever plummet sounded , " I lay inactive . Then , like a chorus , the passion deepened . Some greater interest was at stake ; some mightier cause than ever yet the sword had pleaded , or trumpet had proclaimed . Then came sudden alarms : hurryings to and fro : trepidations of innumerable fugitives , I knew not whether from the good cause or the bad : darkness , and lights : tempest , and human faces ; and at last , with the sense that all was lost , female forms , and the features that were worth all the world to me , and but a moment allowed , ? and clasped hands , and heart-breaking partings , and then ? everlasting farewells ! and with a sigh , such as the caves of hell sighed when the incestuous mother uttered the abhorred name of Death , the sound was reverberated ? everlasting farewells ! and again , and yet again reverberated ? everlasting farewells ! And I awoke in struggles , and cried aloud ? " I will sleep no more ! " Confessions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIAM HAZLITT ( 1778 ? 1830 ) The period now under review is very rich in critical and miscellaneous work . Of the writers of literary criticism Hazlitt may be taken as representative . I. His Life . The son of a Unitarian minister , Hazlitt was born at Maidstone , and , after a brief stay in America , spent most of his youth in Shropshire . His early studies for the Unitarian ministry were soon abandoned . Shortly after he met Coleridge ( 1798 ) , whose zeal for the ideals of the French Revolution he shared . His next ambition was to become a painter , but this , too , he soon abandoned in favour of a literary career . The year 1812 saw him in London , where he was in turn lecturer , parliamentary reporter , and theatre critic . From 1814 until his death he contributed to The Edinburgh Review , while others of his articles appeared in The Examiner , // The Times , and The London Magazine . All through his life his unusual political views and headstrong temperament involved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's earliest writings consisted of miscellaneous philosophical and political works , which are of interest for the light they throw upon his mind , but are now little read . His reputation rests on the lectures and essays on literary and general subjects all published between 1817 and 1825 . Of the former we have his lectures on Characters of Shakespeare 's Plays ( 1817 ) , The English Poets ( 1818 ) , The English Comic Writers ( 1819 ) , and The Dramatic Literature of the Age of Elizabeth ( 1820 ) . His best essays were collected in The Round Table ( 1817 ) , Table Talk ; or , Original Essays on Men and Manners ( 1821-22 ) , and The Spirit of the Age ; or , Contemporary Portraits ( 1825 ) . Between 1828 and 1830 he published an unsuccessful biography of Napoleon . Modern opinion has endorsed the contemporary recognition of Hazlitt 's eminence as a critic . His writing is remarkable for its fearless expression of an honest and individual opinion , and , while he lacks the learned critical apparatus of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate his own enjoyment , and in his gift for evoking unnoticed beauties . His judgments are based on his emotional reactions rather than on objectively applied principles . Consequently , they are sometimes marred by personal bias , as in some of the portraits in The Spirit of the Age . But , for the most part , they show his enthusiasm guided by a strong common sense . The catholicity of his taste embraces almost every major English author from Chaucer to his own day , most of them treated with a discrimination and sympathetic insight which are not blunted by his obvious enthusiasm . In style Hazlitt contrasts strongly with the elaborate orchestration of the complex sentence and the magic of the delicate word tracery which we have seen in De Quincey . His brief , abrupt sentences have the vigour and directness which his views demand . His lectures have a manly simplicity , and something of the looseness of organization which is typical of good conversation . Essays and lectures alike show a fondness for the apt and skilfully blended quotation , and for the balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pure and his expression concise . The following extract is of interest as showing his courageous exposition of an opinion , diametrically opposed to that generally accepted , on the relative merits of Addison and Steele : // It will be said , that all this is to be found , in the same or a greater degree , in the Spectator . For myself , I do not think so ; or , at least , there is in the last work a much greater proportion of commonplace matter . I have , on this account , always preferred the Tatler to the Spectator . Whether it is owing to my having been earlier or better acquainted with the one than the other , my pleasure in reading these two admirable works is not at all in proportion to their comparative reputation . The Tatler contains only half the number of volumes , and , I will venture to say , nearly an equal quantity of sterling wit and sense . " The first sprightly runnings " are there ? it has more of the original spirit , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character and strokes of humour are more true and frequent ; the reflections that suggest themselves arise more from the occasion , and are less spun out into regular dissertations . They are more like the remarks which occur in sensible conversation , and less like a lecture . Something is left to the understanding of the reader . Steele seems to have gone into his closet chiefly to set down what he observed out of doors . Addison seems to have spent most of his time in his study , and to have spun out and wire-drawn the hints , which he borrowed from Steele , or took from nature , to the utmost . I am far from wishing to depreciate Addison 's talents , but I am anxious to do justice to Steele , who was , I think , upon the whole , a less artificial and more original writer . The humorous descriptions of Steele resemble loose sketches , or fragments of a comedy ; those of Addison are rather comments , or ingenious paraphrases , on the genuine text .

Of an ancient family , he was born in Warwickshire , and was educated at Rugby and Oxford . Later he was fired with republican ideas and supported the revolutionaries in Spain . In temper he was impulsive to the point of mania ; and his life is marked by a succession of violent quarrels with his friends and enemies . The middle years of his life were passed in Italy . He returned to England in 1835 and lived in Bath from 1838 to 1858 . In this last year his pugnacity involved him in an action for libel , in which , as defendant , he cut a lamentable figure . Poor and dishonoured , he forsook England , and settled again in Florence , where be died .
