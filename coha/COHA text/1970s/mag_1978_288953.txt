Researchers look at gays <P> Sex Researcher Alfred Kinsey intended to do a study of U.S. homosexuals , but he died in 1956 before the survey could be launched . It took twelve more years for his successors at the Institute for Sex Research in Bloomington , Ind. , to start that project and ten years to complete it . Along the way , the Kinsey-ites spent $1 million and conducted two-to five-hour interviews in the San Francisco Bay Area with 979 male and female homosexuals and a comparison group of 477 heterosexuals . The result of their labors is a tome called Homosexualities , to be published next month by Simon &; Schuster ( $12.95 ) . While the book offers no stunning surprises , it does contain fascinating glimpses into the gay life , circa 1970 , when all the interviewing was completed . <P> Among the findings : <P> &gt; The happiest and best-adjusted homosexuals were those in a " close-coupled " relationship , the equivalent of a good heterosexual marriage . <P> &gt; The surveyors judged 16% of all homosexual males to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or no interest in pursuing sexual contact . <P> &gt; A quarter of the gays interviewed believe homosexuality is an emotional disorder . About one-third had seriously considered stopping all homosexual activity at least once in their lives . <P> The study , written by Psychologist Alan Bell and Sociologist Martin Weinberg , finds that lesbians have fewer problems and are less sexually active than male homosexuals . At the time , three-quarters of the women were involved in relatively stable relationships ; the majority had fewer than ten homosexual partners over a lifetime , and venereal disease was virtually unknown ( one reported case among 293 women ) . Only one-half of the men were in stable relationships ; the average male reported sex acts with hundreds of men , and two-thirds had developed venereal disease at least once . Forty percent of the men had had more than 500 sex partners , and a quarter of them , as adults , had performed sex with boys under 16 . <P> Lesbians were found to be nearly as well adjusted as the heterosexual women , though they scored slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . Homosexual males , however , showed more signs of emotional damage than heterosexual men in nine areas of psychological distress , from depression to paranoia . Twenty percent of the gay men had attempted suicide , vs. 4% of the heterosexual males . Thirteen percent of the gay males , and 5% of females , were listed as " dysfunctional " - those tormented by their homosexuality and plagued with severe psychological , social and sexual problems . <P> Such findings are not unusual in research on homosexuals . Pro-homosexual spokesmen generally argue that gays are placed under heavy stress by an anti-homosexual society . The Kinsey researchers make this point but add a new wrinkle : the evaluation that gay males as a group are not as well adjusted as heterosexuals results from a minority of social misfits dragging down the average . <P>
