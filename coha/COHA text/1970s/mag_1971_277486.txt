DUEL OF EAGLES by Peter Townsend . 480 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $9.95 . <P> <P> He won the heart of the little Princess and then failed to win her hand . That is how the world remembers him : an unsuccessful suitor , elegant and somehow attenuated . Fifteen years later , exGroup Captain and Royal Equerry Peter Townsend finds a role more comfortable for a dashing fighter pilot as the author of a real-life adventure yarn . <P> Part of it is oft-rehashed history-that moment late in 1940 when the outmanned Royal Air Force took on Hitler 's Luftwaffe and changed the course of World War II . But Townsend , himself a hero of the battle , approaches the duel of eagles not as history but as a personal , crotchety reminiscence of the participants . <P> The group captain 's idiosyncrasy is a commitment to obsolete but attractive romance . " Our battle in the air , " he writes , had " the character of a terribly dangerous sport . " Glimpsing an enemy plane , he told himself gleefully before priming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Knight . " Playing Richthofen , Townsend and other British airmen allowed damaged German planes to escape : as they passed the enemy , they gallantly tipped their caps . <P> The author admires for his heroism one Werner Borner , radio operator aboard a crippled German Dornier 17 bomber . Borner 's distinction : he tried to kill Townsend-and nearly succeeded . Flying a Hurricane . Townsend closed with the Dornier as the Germans , elated after a successful attack on shipping in the harbor at Lowestoft , were flying back across the North Sea derisively singing Goodbye , Johnny . Townsend wounded two of the four crew members . Talking with Townsend after the war , Borner , the only man left besides the pilot , recalled that " with a last effort I shot at the Hurricane , which was so close I could see the pilot . " Townsend bailed out and was picked up by a trawler . He had , nonetheless , according to a peculiar chivalry , got the best of Werner Borner . " What fighter pilot , " he writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shot down than to shoot others down ? " <P> Much of this strikes the contemporary reader as anachronistic and worse . Thirty years after the Battle of Britain , enemy pilots see each other as blips on radarscopes , and they do not tip their caps . Yet some things have not changed , certainly not for the better . The villains of Townsend 's book are the villains of the most modern war saga : politicians . <P> About politicians , Townsend is both bitter and occasionally shrewd . He presents well-researched episodes from the 1920s and 1930s , when air force commanders in both England and Germany struggled to strengthen their young units against the opposition of shortsighted , budget-obsessed political bosses . Even Churchill , as early as 1919 when he was Secretary of War , is described as having a " tendency to wobble when attacked . " Townsend 's sole hero on the ground is " Stuffy " Dowding , commander in chief of Britain 's Fighter Command .                @ @ @ @ @
