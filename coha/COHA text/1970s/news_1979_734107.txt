txt In an apparently complete copy of the tape recording made as more than 900 people died at Jonestown , Guyana , last Nov. 18 , the Rev. Jim Jones is heard over and over again exhorting his followers to poison themselves ? sometimes coaxing , other times scolding , always persisting . " You 'll regret it if you do n't , " he says fervently and beseechingly , telling them Guyanese paratroopers are on the way to . torture and murder everyone . The copy of the tape , which has been withheld by the Governments of Guyana and the United States , runs 43 minutes , suggesting that the deaths occurred in much less time than the earlier estimates of several hours . The tape matches almost exactly the length of the tape that the two governments have refused to release , and persons who are familiar with investigations of the Jonestown deaths say the contents of the tape obtained by The New York Times appear to be identical to material from the Government . held tape that has been disclosed . The tape begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avuncular voice that he has tried his best to " give you the good life . " One woman raises strong objections to Mr. Jones 's death proposal , but several others rise to their leader 's defense . There are chilling cries and moans , sporadic outbursts of applause and cheers , the gagging screams of dying children . Finally , a faint cry , a sigh , then nothing but the soft , recorded chords of an organ and a funeral choir . The eerie chronicle of one of the largest ' mass deaths in history runs out , apparently before the gunshots that killed Mr. Jones , his personal nurse and a still unidentified man were fired . Throughout , the tape is clear , with very few inaudible spots , although some names are unintelligible . At some points , there appear to be sudden stops and starts in the flow of sound , as though the recorder had been turned off and on , or the tape awkwardly spliced . There appears to be no disruption to the continuity of the death ceremony , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Beau Buchanan 01 the International Home Video Club , inc. , who obtained it , he said , from " someone who was in Guyana " shortly after the deaths . Mr. Buchanan said heplanned to beginning selling phOnopaph records and tape cassette copies of the final evening at Jonestown in the next 10 days . He decided to turn the tape over to The Times , he said , after a brief segment from another source was broadcast yesterday morning on NBC 's Today show . - ' Less than 24 hours ' earlier , Michael Prokes , a principal aide to . Mr. Jones , shot himself to death after walking out of a news conference.be had called in Modesto , Calif. , to protest the withholding of the tape . Mr. Prokes had said that , as the others were dying , he was sent out of Jonestown with more than $500,000 intended for the Soviet Embassy in Guyana . A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Christopher Nascimento , Guyana 's Minister of State , said the tape had not beep made public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , senior government officials in Georgetown said they had been denied permission to play the tape at a coroner 's jury " because it 's a very delicate political matter . " ? Mr. Prokes said last night that the tape would show that cult members bad not been coerced into dying . From the beginning of the tape , however , Mr. Jones insists that . torture and death are inevitable and that the only dignified solution is for his followers to take their own lives . ' A Revolutionary Suicide ' At least twice be calls himself a prophet , saying at one point , " Christian life without me has no meaning . " " This is a revolutionary suicide , " he says at another juncture , " this is not a self-destructive suicide . " " If you knew what was on the other side , " be says , " you 'd be glad to be stepping over tonight . Several times , his temper flares . " Adults , adults , " he screams once , " I call on you to stop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . . . . Quit telling them they 're dying . All they 're doing is taking a drink they take to go to sleep . That 's what death is : sleep . " What the tape seems to show most clearly is a man gone mad . His despair is evident as the tape begins . " In spite of all I 've tried to'do , a handful of our people , with their lies , have made our life impossible , " he says . " .. If we ca n't live in peace , then let 's die in peace . We 've been betrayed , so terribly betrayed . " Then he tells those crowded into the commune 's main pavilion that an aide who had escorted Congressman Leo J. Ryan and his party and some 20 defectors to their plane had said he intended to board and , shortly after takeoff , shoot the pilot . - " I did n't plan it , " Mr. Jones says , " but I know it 's going to happen . . . . we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over . . . If the children are left , we 're going to have them butchered . " Congressman Ryan had gone into the settlement to investigate reports , later confirmed by many defectors , that some in the commune were being mistreated and being held against their wills . On the tape Mr. Jones refers obliquely to a custody battle started by ; Timothy Stoen , a California lawyer , to recover a 7-year-olii child whom both he add Mr. Jones claimed as a son . That started all the commune 's troubles , he says , Several months before the Congressman 's visit , Mr. Jones had told his followers of plans to move the commune to the Soviet Union or Cuba . At one point on the tape , the woman who raised the most strident objections to the mass death , identified by defectors as Christine Miller , asks , " Is it too late for Russia ? " Indeed it is , Mr. Jones replies , for the killing of the visitors has already begun . Later , Mr. Jones insists he is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio connecting Jonestown with Georgetown had been made inoperable before the final ceremony began . As more and more people stepped forward to drink the mixture of cyanide and fruit drink that Mr. Jones referred to as " the potion " and " the medication ; ' the Russians were apparently forgotten . But while the woman argues with Mr. Jones , a man rails against her . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , having an individual life , " the man says . " Your life has been extended . . . because of him . " As the cries and moans of the dying grow in volume , Mr. Jones yells , " This is no way for people who are socialists and communists to die , no way to die . We must die with some dignity . " Near the end , Mr. Jones returns to his theme . " If you do n't , if you fail to follow my advice , " he says , " you 'll be sorry . It 's better we do it than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of survivors who slipped away from the ceremony have told it , a few final gunshots were fired , and Jonestown was no more .
