Jimmy Carter has conducted his presidency in a remarkably open fashion , but journalists have had little firsthand access to what happens beyond the White House press room . The President readily takes his policies to the people , but he has kept the inner workings of his Administration somewhat of a mystery . Last week , however , TIME Correspondent Stanley Cloud was allowed to observe the President in action for an entire day , both in the White House and in his private family residence . The result is the first intimate look at how Carter governs , offering an extraordinary insight into what is involved daily in being the President of the U.S. today . <P> Jimmy Carter steps from White House elevator No. 1 onto the ground floor of the mansion and smiles . He asks a Secret Service agent standing in the marbled West Hall about a relative 's health . " She 's better , Mr. President , thanks , " the agent answers . It is 6:45 a.m. , the time Carter normally begins his day . He concludes his brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the colonnade bordering the Rose Garden . He throws open the tall glass door to the Oval Office , strides through that exquisite , historic room and heads directly for his study . Another day in Carter 's young presidency has begun . <P> It will be a long and difficult one . Many of the issues preoccupying Washington during the week are converging - in some cases unexpectedly-on the White House . Meanwhile , outside , the sunny morning will slide into a dark and wet afternoon , though occasional bold rays of sunlight will slice through the tumbling clouds and bathe the budding treetops above the south lawn in startling shades of gold . <P> Purist Approach . Carter 's initial grace period with official Washington , if there ever was one , is unmistakably over . The special interests , to whom Carter insists he does not owe a thing , are zeroing in on the White House . Trade-offs and bargains , which Carter does not like , are beginning to be an unavoidable part of his life . " When you start putting forth legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's hard to say when you should deviate from the purist approach and how much deviation is too much . " ' <P> Though the Oval Office is symbolic of the presidency-the literal venue of the nation 's power-Carter tends to use it only for ceremonial occasions and special meetings . Most of his day is spent in his adjacent small study , which is connected to the Oval Office by a short passageway . The room is sunny , the decor simple yet elegant ; long curtains , gold carpet , white couch , two green easy chairs that are prime candidates for recovering . His personal secretary , Susan Clough , sits in an office adjacent to the study . When she is not typing letters or penciling in the almost constant changes in Carter 's daily schedule , she is feeding the President 's Panasonic phonograph with classical LPs . The background music plays all day . Clough types the musical program on a tidy series of yellow three-by-five cards and places them on the President 's desk so that he can make mental notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this Wednesday : Bach 's Toccata and Fugue in D minor , Verdi 's Otello , Gounod 's Romo et Juliette , selections from Puccini and Mozart .
