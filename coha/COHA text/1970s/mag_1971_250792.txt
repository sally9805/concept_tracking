" In negotiations , " Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko once observed , " it is the last 20 minutes that count . " Last week there were strong rumors in Bonn that the four-power Berlin talks , now in their 17th month , might be approaching the 20-minute countdown . When the Big Four ambassadors meet this week in West Berlin 's old Prussian High Court Building , they are expected to make it a marathon session that may last three days . Speculation was that they are ready to hammer out the last kinks in an " umbrella agreement " on the city 's status . Such a breakthrough could not come at a more fitting moment : this week marks the tenth anniversary of the building of the Berlin Wall . <P> Decisive Stage . Though U.S. and British diplomats cautioned last week against undue optimism , and warned that it might be October or even later before an agreement is reached , West German Chancellor Willy Brandt said in Sweden that the talks have reached a " decisive stage . " There were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After last week 's Crimean summit talks , where Berlin was a key topic , East German Communist Party Chief Erich Honecker flew to Moscow . There he conferred with Soviet Party Leader Leonid Brezhnev and Ambassador to East Germany Pyotr Abrasimov , the Soviet representative at the Berlin talks . <P> <P> The pace of the talks has been steadily accelerating since May . Until then the Soviets had insisted that access routes to West Berlin , 110 miles inside East Germany , be worked out by Bonn and the East German regime-which none of the Allies recognize diplomatically . But in May Moscow agreed for the first time since the end of World War II to guarantee free access to and from West Berlin . <P> In return for this concession , West Germany and the Western Allies agreed to limit the Bonn government 's presence in the city by barring certain official visits and meetings of the Bundestag ( West Germany 's national assembly ) . <P> Last Hurdle . After an overall agreement is worked out , West and East Germany will open direct talks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Autobahn and rail fees , procedures for searches . Then the whole package will go back to the Big Four for final approval . <P> The Soviet desire to speed up the Berlin negotiations has become increasingly evident . An agreement would clear the last remaining hurdle for their cherished European Security Conference , aimed at nailing down the status quo in Eastern Europe and getting international recognition for East Germany . It would accelerate the opening of NATO-Warsaw Pact talks on troop reductions in Central Europe . Finally , it would prompt Brandt to seek Bundestag ratification of the nonaggression treaties of Moscow and Warsaw , which have been delayed pending a Berlin agreement . Whether such a settlement happens this week or later , the talks have certainly come a long way since the days when Nikita Khrushchev declared that West Berlin was like a " cancerous growth " that ought to be cut out .
