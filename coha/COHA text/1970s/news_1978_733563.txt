Letters Mideast Negotiations : The New Realities To the Editor : Now that Israel 's retaliation in southern Lebanon has ended and the Israeli Cabinet has , not surprisingly , rallied round its embattled Prime Minister , one must inquire about the portents of peace in the Middle East . If I understand the Prime Minister correctly , he is saying Israel can return no longer to the can not cede either the Sinai settlements or the West Bank and Gaza ( Resolution 242 notwithstanding ) . And Israel can not do so since the areas in question are necessary to insure her continued existence . Valid ? It could be if the conditions extant 1967 prevailed today . Do they ? Decidedly no . There has been at least one dramatic and historic shift in circumstances : Israel 's primary enemy is no more . Egypt 's belligerency has been neutralized ( even satisfied , according to the Egyptian President , in the 1973 war ) and Egypt now supports Israel as en acknowledged neighbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way To the Editor : Memories are short , Yesterday ( April 3 Topics ) you smugly equated Burger King with production-line hamburgers . Yet only a year ago ( March 13 , 1977 ) an extensive article in your financial section hailed Burger King 's dedication to unfettered gustatory independence . That article contained a memorable statement by Donald N. Smith , Burger King 's president , that must have sent a chill up the spine of every self-actualizing hamburger lover : " The individual choice of garnishment can be an important point in this day when individualism , in my mind , is an increasingly important thing to people . " I , for one , count these ringing words alongside Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence . No longer am I the faceless cipher content to accept the garnishment that 's power elite had decreed for me . Today I am a man who can have it my way ! I can step up with head held high and request  --  nay , demand  --  my roll with or without pickle , onion , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation of $200,000 per year is a small enough price for such unique vision and statesmanship . GORDON CARLSON Evanston , Ill. , April 4 , 1978 cause to annihilate Israel is enervated . Yet , given this substantive turnabout , Israel in 1978 has ironically transposed herself into being the interloper , and this is what is racking her supporters and friends . A nation 's territorial integrity is its physical definition , and its sovereignty is its simultaneous counterpart juridical definition , the bounds of each being coterminous . Do the Sinai settlements fit within these twin pillar posts of Israel ? They do , if territorial extention by military might is rationalized as inhering therein . The West Bank ? The mere invocation to this land of the biblical names Judea and Samaria does not suffice to provide the legal nexus to justify Israel 's self-styled liberation of it . ( For one thing , we live in the hereand-now and will live . I hope , in the hereafter ; we will not live in the heretofore . ) Consequently , now that Israel denies herself her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is without merit to accuse the United States of assuming an inversely proportionate anti-Israel/pro-Arab posture . The To the Editor : On March 27 you published a letter which chided you for reporting Pope Paul 's letter to Lebanon and not reporting his letter to the Government of Israel concerning the recent unfortunate loss of innocent life in both countries . The implication was that there was no letter . For the record , the Pope , through the Apostolic Delegate in Jerusalem , did send his condolences to Israel before his letter to the Government of Lebanon and before the Israeli incursion into that country . Here is the text of the telegram sent to the Apostolic Delegate : " The Holy Father , on learning the news of the very grave act of terrorism To the Editor : In a March 29 editorial concerning the validity of requiring landlords whu rent apartments to Brigham Young University students to sign agreements to separate the sexes by building or wing , The Times poses the question suggested by the university president : If it is legal to refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which five women live , why is it illegal to refuse to rent an apartment to a man in a building in which five women rent the other apartments ? The Times , calling the issue " murky , " seems to indicate that it is difficult to find an analytical distinction between the two situations . In fact , there is a very simple analytical distinction . The Supreme Court has ruled that the Bill of Rights implies a constitutionally protected right to privacy . Therefore , the landlord who refused to rent a room to a man who desired to live in an apaitmcnt with five women could justify his refusal on the ground that he was protecting the women 's privacy . On United States has not changed position ; Israel has , and is now seeking support for her newly refined unilateral definition of area peace . To disagree is not to be anti-Israel , and its mere intimation warrants contempt . Lastly , the Palestinians . The enormousness of this problem can not be glossed over . However , the P.L.O . ' s proclamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer lunacy , written document to that effect or not , and should not be the pretext of denying the verity of the Palestinian people . It would appear Israel has a right to demand , inter alia , guarantees , in any agreement that would include the Palestinian people as a willing and voluntary party thereto , not only from the international community but , more important , from her Arab neighbors that they will be instrumental in containing their Palestinian brothers until the P.L.O . is seen to have effectively lost its ability to command allegiance , a terrorist organization better left in memory than in fact . JOSEPH A. TRICARICO Brooklyn , April 5 , 1976 at Tel Aviv , which has caused the loss of numerous human lives , also among the civil population , including unarmed children , charges Your Excellency to express to the families of the victim , . to the wounded , and to the Israeli authorities his heartfelt participation in their sorrow , with an assurance el his fervent prayers .

BRUCE  --  E. ALTSCHULUI Asst . Prof. of Political Science State University at Oswego Oswego , N.Y. , March 29 , 1978 Bombs and Priorities To the Editor : To one who has always believed that " clean bomb " is the ultimate oxymoron , The Times 's support of the neutron bomb is disturbing . Our society may be at last openly defining more highly valued commodity : property as opposed to human life . However , if terrorists of all persuasion will just take note and concentrate on property , leaving people alone , perhaps there is a silver linir. ; ! , in the old mushroom cloud after all . THOMAS QUINLAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condolences to Israel Of Landlords and the Separation of Sexes In Defense of Fund-Raising the United Way To the Editor : Your news report on recent criticisms of United Way 's activities ( April 3 ) gives rise to erroneous inferences that do grave injustice to the thousands of dedicated , public-spirited volunteers now embarked on increasing the national level of United Way fundraising , over the next decade , from about $1 billion to $3 billion . As chairman of the United Way of America , let me respond to each of the three major criticisms mentioned in The Times 's article . First , United Way does not attempt to monopolize the collection of charitable donations . Total philanthropic giving in the U.S. amounts to almost $30 billion . Giving to the 2,300 local United Ways last year amounted to $1.2 billion . Thus , to say that United Way has a " monopoly " when it is involved with scarcely 4 percent of the aggregate is totally without basis in fact . Employers and labor unions encourage United Way employee drives through the payroll deduction system . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . Second , United Way is not trying to drive smaller charities out of existence to eliminate fund-raising competition . On the contrary , United Way is constantly encouraging smaller charities to organize and grow . Last year it raised $1.2 billion in support of 37,000 local and national charities that assist some 34 million families , including a large proportion of minority families . Over a recent nine-year period , United Way admitted over 1,000 new organizations to its low-cost fund-raising efforts . United Ways have encouraged giving to other charitable efforts as well . The entire voluntarism movement will benefit from a public which is motivated to support worthy causes . Third , United Way is not using its fund-raising power to shape policies and programs of local charities . In fact , United Way of America has a specific policy of not dictating to local charities , It does try to apply the expertise accumulated by all its participants . Voluntarism is beset by some real problems . Cities are limited in their tools and resources . In metropolitan areas , uncoordinated and even competing groups try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ways . Charitable agencies waste valuable resources and talent working in a vacuum to develop problem-solving techniques that others have already perfected . What United Way has attempted ? and , to a large extent , succeeded in doing  --  is to see that the most efficient methods are used , and that the bulk of the charitable dollar does indeed go to charity . JOT-IN W. HANLEY Alexandria , Va. , April 5 , 1978 Destructive Patterns ' To the Editor : Kudos to Robert Lindsey and The Times for your recent article on the The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . United Way . Having worked for many agencies under the United Way umbrella , as well as a few under Maryland 's commerce and industry appeal , I have long been aware of the determination of the United Way to do away with combined health appeals or other federations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The insistence on using just CI. , United Way name to erase any ether group 's image , the refusal to allow any designated giving so that contributors can support or not support those causes which they believe in and the direct involvement in United Way staff changing policies of member agencies , all are part of the same pattern . And that pattern may mean that the United Way is sounding the death knell for voluntarism in this nation . Good investigative reporting with complete disclosure of what is going on may he the only way to redirect some of the destructive patterns on the part of an agency supported by countless thousands of well-meaning people . The American public , when armed with the facts , can deal with most any crisis in a pretty positive way . I am convinced this can happen even with United Way , and your article and follow-up materials will ( Rev. ) FREDERICK J. HANNA Reisterstown , Md. , April 6 , 1978                    @
