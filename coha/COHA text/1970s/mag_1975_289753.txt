THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT by CLAIRE TOMALIN <P> 316 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $8.95 . <P> <P> In the early wars for women 's liberation , even the heroines tended to remain unknown soldiers . Perhaps it was partly the fear of oblivion that made Mary Wollstonecraft sit down late in 1791 and in six weeks write the 300 pages of A Vindication of the Rights of Women . Earlier that year , she had broken out of a shell of ladylike anonymity to print a bylined edition of her previously unsigned pamphlet A Vindication of the Rights of Man . It was a loosely reasoned but passionate answer to Edmund Burke 's reservations about the French Revolution . It made Mary Wollstonecraft at 32 a popular radical writer , whose name was thereafter frequently mentioned along with that of her friend Thomas Paine . <P> The Rights of Women became an international bestseller and exposed the lady to the baritone wrath of conservatives and liberals alike . She was vilified for arguing that women should be able to achieve financial independence and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the professional equal of men . Horace Walpole called her a " philosophical serpent " and a " hyena in petticoats . " Even her friends , the liberal though pious Dissenters , were shocked by her challenge to the ancient wisdom that considered women to be imperfect men . <P> Yet it seems fair to conclude from Claire Tomalin 's biography that had Mary Wollstonecraft not stoked herself up for Rights of Women , she would probably have ended up as only a historical footnote : radical editor and translator ; wife of Philosopher William Godwin ; mother of Mary Godwin , future wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and author of Frankenstein . <P> There was a bit of the pathetic patchwork monster about Wollstonecraft herself . Born into a graspy family of weaver-merchants who for several generations had been up and down the economic ladder , she had to pick up her education and her righteous indignation wherever she could find them . Appalled by the strictures of marriage , she attempted to support herself as a governess , then as the head of her own small school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was geared to drama , violent emotion and struggle " without nuance , irony or humor . She was a person who had to dominate people . An early victory was persuading her sister to run away from her loutish husband and baby . Where Wollstonecraft 's confused sense of her own sexuality was concerned , she was as ambivalent and anguished a victim as ever slit her wrists in a Joyce Carol Gates story .
