THE VALACHI PAPERS Directed by TERENCE YOUNG Screenplay by STEPHEN GELLER <P> If The Godfather had been cast with lugs and directed by remote control , it would have looked a lot like The Valachi Papers . <P> Joe Valachi , it will be recalled , was a Brooklyn hood of the lower echelon who sang arias for the McClellan Committee in the fall of 1963 , giving the general public its first peek into the intricacies of the Cosa Nostra . Peter Maas 's bestselling Valachi Papers was based largely on the testimony , and the movie , if we are to believe the screen credits , is based upon Maas 's book , although it could just as easily have been lifted from Dick Tracy 's Crimestoppers Textbook .

In the traditional Robinson role of the chairman of the thugs is Joseph Wiseman , a usually reliable actor who has mysteriously decided to portray the Sicilian overlord Salvatore Maranzano in an accent that is pure Transylvanian . Maranzano divides the gangs all over the country into families , then stands back and watches the fun , quoting Julius Caesar and letting the profits accrue until he himself is finally eliminated by an enterprising rival . Various beatings , tortures and murders ensue , although The Valachi Papers reserves its worst maulings for the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
