( sitting up , looking hard at palm tree down right ; calling to someone off ) Raul ! ( RAUL enters quickly from left . A heavyset , middle-aged man , dark hair . Wears a brightly colored Hawaiian print shirt with a black shoulder holster and snub-nosed .38 over the top of the shirt . White pants , black shoes . He crosses to the bed beside HENRY. ) p. 3 RAUL Sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't " sir " me. ( pointing to palm down right ) You can see the state of the palm . Without even looking . You can feel that something 's off . ( RAUL looks at the palm and then back to HENRY . ) RAUL It 's out of place , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Out of place ! It 's off the deep end ! Look at the position it 's in ! Do something about it . RAUL Yes , sir . ( RAUL crosses down right to the palm and squats down , prepared to turn the base to suit HENRY . ) HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down like a Filipino houseboy ! I did n't ask for that . ( RAUL stands quickly . ) RAUL I 'm sorry , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Ca n't you see what 's called for . Ca n't you perceive it on your own without me guiding you every step of the way . Take a step back . Step away from it ! ( RAUL steps back from the palm and looks at it , then looks back at HENRY . ) HENRY HACKAMORE There . Now look . Ca n't you tell now . RAUL I 'm not sure what you want , sir . p. 4 HENRY HACKAMORE What I want ? What I want is for you to know instinctively what I want . Without any coaching . Without hints . For you to be living inside the very rhythm of my needs . ( RAUL moves to the palm tree and turns it slightly . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Now what are you doing ! Put it back ! Put it back like it was ! ( RAUL turns the palm back to its original position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not it . It 's getting worse . I ca n't believe it . ( RAUL keeps turning the palm trying to restore it to its original position . ) HENRY HACKAMORE After all these years ! Still out of touch . Get away from the damn thing ! Stand back away from it ! ( RAUL stands back from the palm . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Now just look at it . Just stand there and look at it . RAUL I am , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Now try to see it in relationship to the space around it . Try to see the space it 's consuming . RAUL I am . HENRY HACKAMORE Now try to see the space it 's not consuming . Can you see that ? ( Long pause as RAUL stares at the palm ) p. 5 HENRY HACKAMORE No , you ca n't see that . See ? That 's where it goes wrong . All right , all right . I was asking too much . I was pushing it . I was hoping that after so many years you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see I was mistaken . RAUL I 'm willing to try . sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Trying 's not enough . Just forget it . RAUL If you just describe to me how you want it , I 'll move it . HENRY HACKAMORE No ! Descriptions do n't describe the picture I have in my head . I need some turning now . Come and turn me . RAUL ( moving to HENRY ) Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Left side first . Left side . ( RAUL moves to the upstage side of the chair and rolls HENRY onto his left side and holds him in that position as HENRY speaks . ) HENRY HACKAMORE We 'll have to get a palm specialist in here . Probably hard to find in this country . RAUL Oh , I do n't think so , sir . We could dig one up . HENRY HACKAMORE No Americans , though . That 's what we need . An American to deal with it . Someone who understands the urgency . Down here they have a different sense of time or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 RAUL We could fly one in . HENRY HACKAMORE Never mind . I 'll deal with it later . I 'll have you walk me over to it . RAUL No walking , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't keep repeating my limitations to me as though I 've forgotten . As long as I 've got them I ca n't forget them . ( pause ) Rock me . Back and forth . ( RAUL gently rocks his body back and forth , still keeping HENRY on his left side . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Oh , that is stupendous ! What a motion ! Suddenly I 'm flooded with wonderful pictures . RAUL Of what , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Of this place . Of the outside . Of how the outside must find us . This is a new place , is n't it ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Of course it is . A new place in a series of new places . A stepping-stone . You 're trying to sneak me back in , is n't that it ? Did n't I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you closer to the border , sir . In case of an emergency . HENRY HACKAMORE Closer ? The women are still coming though ? p. 7 RAUL Oh yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's still in the plan . RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE ( still being rocked ) I 've got to see them . Every last one of them . Oh , these women , Raul ! Wait till you see them ! Fifteen years it 's been . Wait till you see the way they carry themselves . Like visions . Like moving pictures . How are they coming ? RAUL Jet , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Individually ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE We have that many planes left ? RAUL I think so . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Do my feet . My feet . RAUL Jet , sir . ( RAUL rolls HENRY onto his back . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Move me up first . Pull me up ! RAUL Yes , sir . ( RAUL moves to the head of the chair , grabs HENRY under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He props pillows behind his back , then moves down to HENRY 'S feet and starts massaging his toes . HENRY keeps talking. ) p. 8 HENRY HACKAMORE Pictures , Raul . Pictures ! Every shift of the body brings a new wave . It 's amazing . Almost a rejuvenating effect , although I should n't go overboard in my expectations . ( pause ) We came here at night , did n't we ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Always at night . Pitch black . Wrapped in a gray stretcher . Theoretically I should n't have seen a thing . Numb to the world . RAUL There was a full moon . HENRY HACKAMORE I was asleep ? RAUL You 'd awake in fits . HENRY HACKAMORE Fits ? RAUL Spurts . HENRY HACKAMORE Oh yeah . Short bursts . Short bursts of waking . Still , that does n't account for these vivid details . Golden beaches . Black-headed kids . Shimmering , silver water . How do you account for that ? RAUL You 're seeing that now ? HENRY HACKAMORE Off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet . RAUL I am , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You are ? You 're doing them now ? RAUL Yes , sir . p. 9 HENRY HACKAMORE That 's funny . I ca n't feel a thing . RAUL Well , it comes and goes , does n't it , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right . Comes and goes . Ca n't depend on it . But why all those images then ? RAUL We could raise the curtain . ( HENRY jerks his feet away from RAUL and struggles to a sitting position . RAUL tries to calm him . ) HENRY HACKAMORE No ! Nothing from out there comes in here ! Nothing ! No life ! Not sun , not moon , not sound , not nothing ! RAUL I know , sir . I 'm sorry . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's the law ! That 's the absolute law ! RAUL I know , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE What a suggestion ! Curtain up in the middle of the day . RAUL I just thought you might want it for a second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your desires mine . If you need a vacation it can be arranged . Do n't piddle around in here trying to figure out what 's best for you in the disguise of what 's best for me . We 've been together too long for that . RAUL I just thought if you were seeing things it might be good to open up the room a little . p. 10 HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm always seeing things ! The room 's got nothing to do with it . I was seeing things before you were born . Before I was born I was seeing things . I prefer seeing things to having them crash through my window in the light of day . It 's a preference , not a disappointment . RAUL ( pause ) Would you like something to eat , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE ( pause ) Why do you always do that ? Why do you constantly switch the areas of my concern ? Food is not on my mind . Food has nothing to do with what 's on my mind . Pictures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't mix ! Pictures of food do n't mix ! RAUL I 'm sorry , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You have to be more sensitive , Raul , to the subtle shifts in my intellectual activity . The mind covers a wide range of territory . Sometimes simultaneously traveling several different hemispheres in a single sweep and then diving suddenly for the prey . RAUL I understand , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You do ? You understand what the prey is ? The prey is an idea . A single , lonely , fleeting idea trying to duck into a rabbit hole and the mind comes sweeping in for the kill . RAUL It 's a beautiful idea , sir . p. 11 HENRY HACKAMORE That 's not an idea ! It 's a description . An idea is something useful . ( pause ) Do my back . My back ! ( RAUL moves around to the head of the chair and starts massaging HENRY 'S back . Pause . ) RAUL It would be great to fly over America in the daytime though . Just once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? Out of the clear blue sky . Flying ? What an idea . RAUL Just to see it . I have n't seen it in ten years . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's not true . Anyway , nothing 's changed . I guarantee it . All it would do is tempt you . Fill you with a lot of aching . Desire again . Desire all over the place . Land of lust . RAUL These women  --  HENRY HACKAMORE What about them ? RAUL I 'm not to touch them . You do n't have to worry about that . HENRY HACKAMORE Something in your need to remind me , fills me with trepidation . You should take it for granted that you wo n't touch them . RAUL I do , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't take it as a taboo . That will only lead to trouble . It should be deeply rooted in your blood . p. 12 RAUL What should ? HENRY HACKAMORE Your lack of lust ! Have n't you learned anything from me ! I should be a living testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . More alive . Nevertheless you should be able to see where desire leads just by looking . That not only goes for the body , Raul , but the spirit , the soul . The body 's the least of it . RAUL ( still massaging ) I ca n't see your soul , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Of course not . Good point . But take it from me , there are certain unseen parts that are thoroughly ravaged beyond recognition . Worse than what you see . Far worse . RAUL Can you feel my hands ? HENRY HACKAMORE Vaguely . Keep rubbing . RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE ( pause ) I want you to keep something in mind , Raul . When these women begin to fill up my room I want you to keep something firmly in mind . RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE I want you to constantly remember , as you 're taking them in with your eyes , that at one time or another I 've penetrated every single one of them . Every last one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 13 RAUL I will , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Promise ? RAUL I 'm not to touch them , sir . You can be sure of that . ( HENRY violently pulls himself away from RAUL 'S touch . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Stop saying that ! Stop telling me that ! RAUL Should I leave , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE No ! RAUL Should I take a vacation ? HENRY HACKAMORE No vacation ! Not at this point in the game . I might need you at any minute . At any minute we may have to evacuate . You 're aware of that . RAUL Yes , sir . ( Pause . HENRY looks hard at RAUL . ) HENRY HACKAMORE You 're more aware of it than I am in fact . That 's why you 've brought me here . Closer to the border . My lucidity is not without its bounds , Raul . It comes and goes like the rest of it . But that 's no reason to assume that I 'm a total blathering fool . Crisis is a normal state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not blind to the fact of my dying . I 'm living it while you 're on the outskirts . While you 're hanging around in a holding pattern dreaming about America in the daylight . While asshole doctors visit me in my sleep . Sneaking in here in the dark and shaking their heads over my bed . Waiting across the border for me , in a hospital I built myself with excess cash . p. 14 RAUL No one 's gone over your head sir . No decisions without your approval . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's obvious ! The decisions are mine ! It 's a foolproof organization although at times I wonder how it could be when the very ones closest to me seem farthest away . RAUL You are the sole stockholder , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Your forthrightness fills me with suspicion , Raul . Now why should that be ? How could that be the case ? Has my body poisoned my mind along with everything else ? Why does it seem like every nuance in your verbal patterns is designed to hide some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a one-way mirror when I can see you plain as day . It is you , is n't it ? ( suddenly panics , screaming ) RAUL ! IT IS YOU IS N'T IT ? ( RAUL rushes to him and holds him firmly . HENRY grabs onto his arms in terror . RAUL strokes his head and calms him down . ) RAUL ( stroking his head ) Yes sir . It 's me . It 's always me . HENRY HACKAMORE Rub my head ! My head ! ( RAUL eases him back into the pillows , rubbing his head . ) RAUL Try to be calm , sir . p. 15 HENRY HACKAMORE Calm ? Have you ever known terror to be calm ? RAUL No , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't let them take me while I 'm sleeping , Raul . Promise me . RAUL I wo n't , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Even if they think I 'm dead I wo n't be . RAUL No , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'll just be sleeping . RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAUL It was your orders , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE My orders ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Where do my orders come from , Raul ? ( Pause as RAUL strokes his head . ) RAUL Would you like a drink , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE What is there ? RAUL Pineapple , coconut , papaya , mango , tangelo . HENRY HACKAMORE A paradise . America never had such things . Not the America I knew . RAUL Oh , I 'm sure they have all the juices up there by now , sir . p. 16 HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm sure . If I did n't travel by night I 'd see some of these things . RAUL You might . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'd see more than I bargained for probably . ( pause ) Why is daylight so terrifying , Raul ? RAUL I do n't know . HENRY HACKAMORE Pineapple . Make it pineapple . Pineapple seems the least dangerous . RAUL Yes , sir . ( moving away from HENRY ) Try to sleep if you can . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies there a while silently . He starts to sing to himself , repeating the same phrase over and over again . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( singing to himself ) Hey ba ba re bop . Hey ba ba re bop . Hey ba ba re bop . Hey ba ba re bop . ( He stops singing and sits up abruptly in the chair . He looks around the space as though remembering something , then carefully gets up and pulls out a large cardboard box from underneath the reclining chair . He next pulls out a roll of paper towels and starts tearing off sections and laying them on the floor . He starts singing again as he does this , repeating the phrase. ) p. 17 HENRY HACKAMORE ( singing ) Hey ba ba re bop . Hey ba ba re bop. ( etc . ) ( He sits on the floor and pats the towels firmly , then pulls out several thick manuscripts from the cardboard box . He picks up each one and pounds it on all four edges on top of the paper towels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor beside the box . He goes through this process like a private ritual which has lost its original purpose . As he continues repeating this action while singing , the large black curtain upstage begins to slowly ascend up into the flies revealing a slightly raised platform . As the curtain continues to rise , without HENRY 'S knowing , Venetian blinds are revealed which cover the entire upstage wall from floor to ceiling . The blinds are open and through the cracks can be seen a huge silver full moon with a long reflection cast on what appears to be the ocean . Directly in front of the blinds , standing on the platform , upstage center is a beautiful young woman named LUNA . She has black hair and is dressed like a Hollywood starlet of the thirties . Furs , high heels , stockings with seams , patent leather purse , etc . She just stands there looking down at HENRY until the black curtain has disappeared above . HENRY continues with his manuscripts and singing , unaware of her presence . His back is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 HENRY HACKAMORE ( singing ) Hey ba ba re bop . Hey ba ba re bop. ( etc . ) LUNA ( from the platform ) So , the real Henry Hackamore is taking guests ? ( HENRY stops singing immediately and struggles to his feet but does not turn upstage to see her . His body seems unable to turn around . He scrambles for a brass bell underneath the reclining chair . He pulls it out and starts ringing it frantically for help and calling RAUL . LUNA stays on the platform and smiles down at him . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( ringing the bell ) Raul ! We 've been penetrated ! They 've found their way in ! LUNA ( giggling but staying behind him on platform ) Visitors from the outside world . Alien life . HENRY HACKAMORE ( ringing bell ) Raul ! Drop the pineapple and get in here ! ( HENRY drops the bell and starts frantically putting all the manuscripts back into the cardboard box and shoves it under the chair . ) LUNA Sweeping it under the table Henry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY HACKAMORE ( ringing bell again ) RAUL ! ( HENRY keeps scrambling with the manuscripts , cleaning up the paper towels. ) p. 19 LUNA I 'd hate to have come all this way to be in the company of a stranger . ( RAUL charges on from left with his pistol drawn . He sees LUNA and stops . He looks at HENRY and then puts his gun back in the holster . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( to RAUL ) Where have you been ! There 's someone in here ! Right now , there 's someone in here ! I ca n't see them but I hear them ! RAUL It 's one of the ladies , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE What ladies ! Help me up on the chair ! Help me ! ( RAUL goes to HENRY and lifts him onto the chair so that he 's facing front with his back to LUNA , legs hanging over the side . He starts pulling sheets of Kleenex out of the box and covering his legs with them . ) RAUL ( as he helps HENRY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests , only visitors ! RAUL She 's a visitor then , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE How did she get in ! ( LUNA giggles and walks back and forth on the platform . ) RAUL I do n't know sir . p. 20 HENRY HACKAMORE Ask her ! RAUL ( to LUNA ) Mr. Hackamore would like to know how you got in , ma'am ? LUNA It was n't easy . RAUL ( to HENRY ) She wo n't give a straight answer , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Well get her around here in front of me for God 's sake ! I ca n't see through the back of my head . RAUL ( to LUNA ) Mr. Hackamore is unable to turn around , ma'am . Could you come down here in front of him so he can see you ? LUNA Mr. Hackamore is unable to turn around ? RAUL Yes , ma'am . LUNA He can hear me , ca n't he ? Is n't that enough ? He does n't have to see me . He has n't seen me for fifteen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't like the sound of her . RAUL ( to LUNA ) Could you tell Mr. Hackamore your name ? LUNA Oh , he knows my name . Just leave us alone . You 're very charming but unnecessary . I 'm not going to hurt him . I 'm just teasing him a little . p. 21 HENRY HACKAMORE I ca n't stand this ! LUNA He 's getting excited . RAUL ( to HENRY ) Try not to scream , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Why wo n't she come around here ! Raul , use your influence . ( RAUL moves upstage toward LUNA . She stops him . ) LUNA ( to RAUL ) Easy . Easy . I 'm not alone . HENRY HACKAMORE She was told to come alone ! Everything 's falling apart . LUNA ( to RAUL ) Just go away and leave us . I 'll be nice to him . Do n't worry . HENRY HACKAMORE ( still facing front ) Do n't leave , Raul ! Not until I see her face . RAUL Please , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and then I 'll go . HENRY HACKAMORE Is she beautiful , Raul ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Very beautiful ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You 're not getting worked up , are you ? p. 22 RAUL No , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You 're remembering what I told you ? RAUL Yes , sir . LUNA ( to RAUL ) You two have an agreement , is that it ? HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't talk to her , Raul ! Do n't get involved . ( LUNA laughs . ) RAUL Please , ma'am . LUNA Oh do n't beg me . You can see I 'm harmless . RAUL I ca n't leave him alone . LUNA All right . All right . I 'll reveal myself . Slowly . A step at a time . ( She starts to move slowly off the platform , down toward HENRY as she speaks . ) RAUL She 's coming , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Wonderful ! LUNA Anticipation is delicious , is n't it , Henry ? Truly delicious . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking . RAUL You know her now , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Not yet . LUNA ( to HENRY ) Is n't your whole body thundering ? Mine is. p. 23 HENRY HACKAMORE Oh God , Raul ! What 'd I tell you ! Did n't I tell you this would be terrific ! RAUL Do you want me to leave you now , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE No ! There 's still a possible danger . There 's always that slim chance of danger . Just when you let your guard down . LUNA It 's true . That 's when it happens . Just when you let your guard down . HENRY HACKAMORE It 's almost worth the risk , though . LUNA ( still advancing , coming left toward HENRY from behind ) This is risky , Henry . Very risky . HENRY HACKAMORE I do n't care . I 've been in jams before . Jams of an international stature . This is nothing . LUNA Peanuts . HENRY HACKAMORE Just come around so I can see you ! Just show yourself ! LUNA Easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me in front of my bodyguard ! LUNA Oh please , Henry . It 's you that wo n't let him go . All this could be avoided . RAUL I 'll turn around , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Yes ! Yes , turn around . Cover your eyes . Plug up your ears . This is between me and myself . ( RAUL turns around upstage right and covers his eyes . LUNA keeps advancing . She comes up almost parallel with HENRY . Stage left of him. ) p. 24 LUNA Silly . It 's very silly . HENRY HACKAMORE It 's not silly ! It 's desperate . Show yourself ! ( LUNA suddenly walks out directly in front of HENRY and smiles at him . She opens her furs . She is wearing a slinky blue evening gown , diamond necklace and earrings . She lets the furs fall to her elbows and turns herself seductively in front of him like a high fashion model . Henry stares in awe . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Oh God . Oh my living God . Oh my Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( RAUL drops his hands from his eyes then quickly covers them again . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( stretching his hand out toward LUNA ) Oh . ( LUNA moves toward him , smiling , and reaches for his hand . HENRY pulls it back quickly . ) LUNA You are a demon , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE I was . LUNA Anyone with nails like that should have been dead long ago . What 're you raising , corkscrews or something ? HENRY HACKAMORE Rub my head . ( She moves toward him . HENRY pulls back . ) HENRY HACKAMORE No ! p. 25 RAUL Can I leave now , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yes . No ! Wait a minute . ( to LUNA ) Empty your purse out . LUNA Henry , this is insulting . It 's not enough that I liquidate my affairs overnight after not hearing from you for years , leave without telling a soul my destination in an unmarked jet , for an unmarked island , but on top of it all I have to empty my purse out on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open her purse and dumps the contents on the chair beside HENRY , to his right . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Raul , check it . ( RAUL moves to the chair and looks through the objects quickly . ) RAUL It 's all right , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Nothing that could be construed as a weapon ? RAUL Nothing . HENRY HACKAMORE No daggers ? Poison ? Bombs ? Even the most innocent looking things are potential killers . RAUL No , sir . She 's clean . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Put the contents in a plastic bag . Take the bag to the parking lot . Drive the Chevrolet back and forth over the bag sixteen times . Collect the smashed remains and put them in another bag . Take that bag to the beach . Rent a small boat . Row out to the twenty-mile limit . Dump the bag . Abandon the boat and swim to shore . p. 26 RAUL ( starts to move ) Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Oh , before you do that bring us in a chaise longue and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps the objects off the chair into his shirt and exits left . LUNA watches RAUL . HENRY watches her . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( after pause ) Do n't be insulted . Everyone gets the same treatment . Some are even flattered . LUNA Flattered ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yes , flattered . The innocent crave to be guilty . There 's a certain pride in having one 's dormant criminal instincts beckoned up by suspicion . It 's not even that I 'm particularly suspicious . LUNA Just cautious . HENRY HACKAMORE Just careful . LUNA Just nuts . That was harmless stuff . A bunch of harmless makeup ! HENRY HACKAMORE Nothing 's harmless till it 's squashed . LUNA If you expect this meeting to go on for any length of time you might try lightening up your act , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm sorry but I do n't even know you . p. 27 LUNA That 's it ! ( She moves as if to go then stops when HENRY speaks . ) HENRY HACKAMORE No please ! I thought I 'd recognize you immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . LUNA Thanks . HENRY HACKAMORE There 'll be something for you to sit on in a minute . I do n't like keeping anything extra in here . Just more surfaces for things to collect on . Microscopic things . That 's the worst . What you ca n't see . I 'd have you sit on my chair  --  ( pauses ) Just a minute . ( He starts pulling off sections of paper towel and spreading them on the chair beside him . ) LUNA Do n't worry about it . I like standing . HENRY HACKAMORE ( continuing with towels ) Did you like the plane ? LUNA The plane ? HENRY HACKAMORE The jet . I designed it from scratch . The very latest . LUNA Yes , it 's fine . HENRY HACKAMORE It 's yours . You can take it back with you . LUNA Thanks . HENRY HACKAMORE Were you expecting more ? p. 28 LUNA Look , Henry , Just relax , all right ? I 'm here out of curiosity more than anything else . Do n't jump to conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . I do n't need more . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . One of the satisfied . One of the few . ( RAUL pushes on a green-and-white-striped bamboo chaise longue from stage left . He pushes it across the stage behind HENRY 'S chair and places it down right facing left . . My favorite , bamboo . ( to LUNA ) Now you wo n't have to sit on my chair after all . You wo n't have to deposit unseen , invisible plant life . ( He pushes all the paper towels onto the floor and slaps his hands together . LUNA smiles at the chaise longue then looks at HENRY . ) LUNA ( looking at chaise ) If I sit does that mean I 'm staying ? HENRY HACKAMORE You want to stay , do n't you ? You would n't have come if you did n't want to stay . LUNA You do n't seem to have any trouble staying . How long have you been here anyway ? p. 29 HENRY HACKAMORE None of that stuff ! LUNA Too sticky , huh ? Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , right ? HENRY HACKAMORE You 're still on the payroll . LUNA Are you kidding ? You think I 've been sitting there by the pool , waiting for your next whim all these years ? HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't tell me about it ! Times have changed . I 've lived through earthquakes , disasters , corruptions , fallout , wives , losses beyond belief . LUNA Poor baby . HENRY HACKAMORE I do n't need that ! I 'm not responsible now for your naive beliefs in what I was then . Anything I might have told you was a lie . LUNA True . HENRY HACKAMORE So why needle me ? LUNA Then you do recognize me ? You do remember ? HENRY HACKAMORE I remember something . Parts of something . LUNA You 're lucky I still recognize you . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm sorry . I did n't have a chance to clean up . We lost track of the planes . LUNA Planes ? You mean there 's other ones coming ? ( HENRY pauses. ) p. 30 LUNA There are , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the " dollies . " HENRY HACKAMORE I 've been in the company of men for twenty-one years and in all that time I 've never raised my voice so much as I have in the past ten minutes ! LUNA ( in sex-kitten voice ) I 'm sorry , Henry . Let me comply . Anything you want . Just tell me . Tell me once and it 's yours . HENRY HACKAMORE Anything ? LUNA The world . HENRY HACKAMORE I have that . LUNA Something else ? HENRY HACKAMORE What else is there ? LUNA Heaven ? HENRY HACKAMORE Oh my God ! LUNA Heaven , Henry ? HENRY HACKAMORE You 're being sarcastic ! It 's uncanny how you lose touch with female elusiveness . LUNA I 'm not , Henry . I 'm not now and I was n't then . HENRY HACKAMORE Was n't what ! My mind 's a jumble from all this . LUNA Sarcastic . HENRY HACKAMORE Oh . p. 31 LUNA I 'm not . Anything you want . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't confuse my body . My mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you actually dying , Henry ? HENRY HACKAMORE I suppose . I suppose I actually am . They tell me I 'm actually not but actually I am . I know it . They would n't have moved me here if I was n't . I look it , do n't I ? LUNA You look like something from another world . HENRY HACKAMORE I am . That 's true . I ca n't take the sun anymore . LUNA Do you want me to rub you like I used to ? HENRY HACKAMORE No ! I have a man for that ! Nothing from outside touches me ! Go sit down ! ( LUNA goes down right and sits on the chaise , facing toward HENRY . She preens herself , pulls her dress up and crosses her legs . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( struggling to get up from the chair ) It 's a mutual arrangement . I do n't touch it , it does n't touch me . That 's what happens when you rape something , is n't it ? LUNA Rape ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a repulsion between both sides . p. 32 LUNA I would n't know . HENRY HACKAMORE Really ? That clean , huh ? That above it all ? LUNA Do n't fall , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE ( still struggling to stand ) I 'm not falling ! I 'm standing ! There 's certain machinery at work that thinks I ca n't even move . Some even think I 'm dead . Others do n't know . Most others do n't know . That 's the best of all . Keeping them all in the dark . That 's the best . ( LUNA stretches herself out on the chaise as HENRY tries to walk inch by inch toward her . ) LUNA Like me ? HENRY HACKAMORE You 're the least of it . Harmless . The worst is invisible . They know that . That 's why they fear me . That 's why they ca n't put a finger on me . A stab in the dark . LUNA Are you coming toward me , Henry ? ( LUNA stretches herself seductively for him . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to walk ) They comb the cities for me . Little American towns . Fortunes are spent on hired assassins . Presidents fear me . International Secret Agencies , Internal Revenues . Secretaries of Defense . Mobsters . Gang Lords , Dictators , Insurance Detectives . None of them can touch me . None of them . p. 33 LUNA ( stretching , arms over her head ) You 're a master , Henry . A wizard ! HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm invisible ! LUNA ( giggling ) I can see you . HENRY HACKAMORE Untouchable ! LUNA ( holding out her arms to him ) Touch me . ( HENRY tries painfully to get closer to her . Puts out his arm . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I ca n't . LUNA Can you see me , Henry ? Look . ( She rolls herself from side to side . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Something . Something 's there . LUNA What do you see ? ( She rakes her fingers through her hair and lets it fall over the chaise . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I see you moving . LUNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhes on the chaise as HENRY keeps getting nearer . ) LUNA Do you see me breathing ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yes ! I see your skin moving . It 's incredible . ( She arches her back and smiles at him. ) p. 34 LUNA Do you see my teeth ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yes ! Your teeth . Your pearly gates . LUNA What else ? HENRY HACKAMORE Your femaleness . It 's an awesome power . ( LUNA squirms with delight . HENRY is getting closer to her . ) LUNA Henry , it 's only me . HENRY HACKAMORE It 's not only you ! It 's a force . With men I was always a master . They 'd lick my heels . Men become dogs in a second . It 's the female that 's dangerous . Uncontrollable . Catlike . LUNA Henry . ( She runs her hands over her stomach and hip . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Your pearly gates . Look at them spreading for me . Shining . Calling me in . It 's exactly how I pictured it . Exactly . The gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Her actions get more and more erotic . ) HENRY HACKAMORE They never counted on this . My private salvation . My ultimate acquisition . No spy in the world could ever see what I really had my eyes on . Where my real hunger lay . My ravenous appetite . Beyond private holdings . My instincts were right . At the front door to death I needed women ! Women more than anything ! Women to fill me up . To ease me into the other world . To see me across . To bring me ecstasy and salvation ! Do n't let me fall ! Do n't ever let me fall ! ( HENRY collapses on top of LUNA and goes unconscious . LUNA screams and tries to struggle out from under him but he stays lying across her . RAUL rushes on from left with two tall tropical-looking drinks . He sees the situation and puts the drinks down on the night table beside HENRY 'S chair . He rushes over to HENRY and LUNA on the chaise. ) p. 35 LUNA Get him off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUNA Jesus Christ ! ( RAUL sweeps HENRY up in his arms and rushes him over to his chair and lays him down . LUNA stands and brushes herself off . ) LUNA If he thinks I flew all the way down here to get jumped on , he 's crazy . RAUL ( to LUNA as he attends HENRY ) How did this happen ! What 've you been doing to him ? LUNA Me ? I did n't do a damn thing ! He collapsed on me . Started mumbling about salvation and ecstasy , next thing I knew , wham , he 's on top of me . The guy 's a maniac . ( RAUL turns away from HENRY and approaches LUNA slowly . She backs up from him slightly . ) RAUL I want to tell you something , ma'am . You have n't seen the boss in fifteen years , right ? LUNA Yeah . So what ? RAUL In fifteen years a lot of things happen . A whole lot of things . Now he may have invited you down here for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit on shinola if it gets in our way . You understand ? p. 36 LUNA I think so . RAUL I think so too . Now you just string him along with whatever he wants . He may want a lot of funny things but you just play the ball game . Just like all the rest of us . We 've been doing it for all these years . It wo n't hurt you to do it for a few days . LUNA A few days ? RAUL Maybe less . Do n't worry , it wo n't be that long . ( RAUL turns and exits left . LUNA is left alone with HENRY , who is still unconscious , breathing heavily . She crosses up to him slowly and looks at him . She reaches out to touch him , then pulls her hand away . ) LUNA Henry ? ( No response from HENRY . ) LUNA Henry , do n't die , okay ? ( HENRY stays unconscious . MIAMI enters from up right on the upstage platform , looking out through the blinds then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women dressed in the same style and era as LUNA but in pale orange and salmon colors . The effect of both women should be that they 've stepped directly out of HENRY 'S past without aging . She crosses downstage toward HENRY and LUNA . ) MIAMI ( to LUNA ) Cripes , how many floors they got in this crib ? I come up twenty-five on the elevator and the lights go blank . No numbers . Thing 's still shootin ' up . Pickin ' up speed . Feel like to puke . p. 37 LUNA ( motioning to drinks ) Have a drink . MIAMI ( taking off her coat ) You kidding ? That 'd do it for sure . That 'd put it right over the top . I got ta get my sea legs first . ( looks at HENRY ) Who 's this old dude ? LUNA Do n't you recognize him ? ( MIAMI tosses her coat over HENRY 'S legs and takes a closer look at him . ) MIAMI Am I supposed to ? Looks like he 's half dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUNA picks up a drink and crosses back down right to the chaise and sits . MIAMI moves around HENRY 'S chair . ) MIAMI Weird place to die in , if he 's dyin ' . LUNA He 's dying , all right . MIAMI Somethin ' about your tone of voice gives me the feelin ' that you know somethin ' more than me . I do n't like that feelin ' . LUNA Tough . LUNA I can back it up . MIAMI Hold it , hold it . I 'm still in the grips of jet-lag . I 'm not here for a slug-out . I 've got an appointment . p. 38 LUNA ( laughing ) An appointment ! MIAMI For some reason I had the idea I was gon na ' be met with bowls of roses . Little guys dressed up like Philip Morris relieving me of my wrap . LUNA Well , there 's nothing like disappointment for broadening one 's character . MIAMI Hey , look , do n't use words like " one 's " around me , okay ? Gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean if we 're gon na ' be spendin ' any time together . LUNA I doubt if we will be . MIAMI Swell . What is this , the waiting room or something ? LUNA What 's your name ? MIAMI Miami . LUNA Miami , this is not the waiting room . This is the room . The main room . The innermost chamber room . The secret nucleus that everything springs from . The Pharaoh 's crypt . And lying in state , at the very heart of things , is the Pharaoh himself . MIAMI ( pointing to HENRY ) He 's the Pharaoh ? LUNA He 's the Hackamore . The Mr. Henry Malcolm Hackamore . ( MIAMI looks at HENRY then back to LUNA then crosses closer to HENRY and takes another look. ) p. 39 MIAMI No shit . This is him , huh ? LUNA The one and only . MIAMI Whew ! Got a little unravelled , did n't he ? LUNA He 's let himself go . MIAMI I 'll say . I do n't know if I can handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a sip . ) LUNA This is nothing . Wait till he wakes up . ( RAUL enters from left pushing an intravenous rack with a bottle of blood hanging upside down and a long tube attached . MIAMI backs off down left and watches as RAUL inserts the needle in HENRY 'S arm and tapes it down . MIAMI looks over to LUNA , who shrugs her shoulders . HENRY suddenly speaks but stays still . The women listen . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Raul ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's you ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Whose blood is it this time ? RAUL Only the best , sir . Guaranteed . HENRY HACKAMORE Genius blood ? Only genius blood ? ( RAUL looks uneasily at the women , then answers HENRY. ) p. 40 RAUL Yes , sir . Only genius . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Because I 've made my decision . RAUL What 's that , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE To fly . I 'm going to fly again . RAUL Fly , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE Straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the day . I 'm going to land with my women . All of us . We 're going to disembark in the blazing sun . We 're going to appear out of nowhere . We 're going to climb into sixteen black Chevrolets and drive straight out across the Mojave Desert . RAUL You think you 're capable of flying again , sir ? ( The women move in closer to the couch to hear HENRY . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm capable of anything . At any moment anything is possible . Now I want you to find me the proper equipment . The jacket I used to wear . The helmet . The scarf . I 'll need all those things . RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE ( noticing curtain is up ) And lower the damn curtain ! How long has it been up like that ? RAUL Not long , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Lower it ! Anything could be out there trying to get in . Anything ! Have you got any idea what 's out there , Raul ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . HENRY HACKAMORE The world at large ! That 's what 's out there . Wild . Undominated . Ravenous for the likes of us . Ready to gobble us up at the drop of a hat . We ca n't allow penetration . Not at any cost . Whatever the price we have to pay it to insure our immunity . You have to insure that for me , Raul . It 's in your hands . These women will deliver me . These two women . Nobody else . I do n't want anybody else in here . RAUL Nobody 's getting in here , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE ( to himself as he lies back on chair ) This time I 'll escape for good . It 's guaranteed . A clean sweep . A slice of the atom . Cataclysmic . Perfect timing . Absolutely perfect timing . ( HENRY beckons the women toward him . They start to move very slowly and hesitatingly toward HENRY . Randy Newman 's song " Lonely at the Top " from the Sail Away album ( Reprise Records ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain upstage starts to slowly descend , covering the blinds , moon , etc . The descent of the curtain is very slow and timed to touch the stage floor just as the song ends . The stage lights are fading in the same tempo as the curtain . HENRY keeps slowly beckoning the women toward him . Song ends . Lights go to black . RAUL exits. ) @x ( as women dress ) Very impressive . Very interesting little rendition . Choice of music 's a little off the wall but aside from that I 'd say you two make a nifty combination . p. 43 LUNA Thanks , Henry . You were always more than generous . HENRY HACKAMORE I was never more than generous ! I was never guilty enough to be more than generous . MIAMI Henry , what 's the scoop here anyway ? What 've you got planned for us ? HENRY HACKAMORE Planned ? ( laughs to himself ) You girls believe in destiny do n't ya ' ? To a certain extent ? Prophesy of one kind or another ? ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HENRY HACKAMORE I mean you 're not gon na ' tell me that you map out every move you make in a day . Calculate your every word . There 's still a spark of the sense of adventure left ? Am I wrong ? MIAMI It 's always good to see you , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right . I 've never let you down in the past . LUNA Well  --  HENRY HACKAMORE Well what ! LUNA Maybe once . HENRY HACKAMORE When was that ? You 're not gon na ' drag up a lot a ' dreary reminiscences for me now are ya ' ? A lot a ' false accusations over circumstances beyond your control ! p. 44 LUNA Beyond my control ? HENRY HACKAMORE And mine ! Certain moves had to be made . Without hesitation ! Certain disclosures . Immediate decisions . LUNA All right ! It 's too far gone now anyway . HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't play magnanimous with me ! LUNA Well , shall we go tooth and nail with it then , Henry ? Shall we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , let 's not go and get worked up about the past , okay ? HENRY HACKAMORE She started it ! She 's the one ! LUNA ( laughing ) Henry , you 're wonderful ! You 're absolutely wonderful ! I always felt like I was ten years old around you and I still do . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'll resist the temptation to take that as a slur . My visions were always of you reveling in the luxury of hotel rooms . Sinking up to the neck in bubble baths . Blanketing your naked body with Pomeranians . All at my expense ! LUNA ( laughing ) Yes ! That was me ! That was me ! HENRY HACKAMORE Hardly the environment that would foster complaint ! Let alone accusations . You , high on the hog and me , risking my life in a desert junkyard ! p. 45 LUNA ( laughing harder ) Oh ! Risking your life ! Yes ! For me ! HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right ! Shadowboxing with the underground is n't my idea of a kid 's game . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Danger ! MIAMI Knock it off will ya ' ! ( LUNA stops laughing ) Jesus , I did n't fly all the way down here to get treated to this . ( HENRY goes silent , starts pulling out sheets of Kleenex and putting them on his legs . Pause . ) MIAMI Henry ? ( HENRY stays silent , absorbed in the Kleenex action . MIAMI and LUNA look at each other . ) MIAMI ( crossing to HENRY ) Henry , look , it 's all right with me if you want to keep this thing a secret . I 'm game . It 's kind of exciting not knowing what to expect . ( HENRY stays silent with Kleenex ) We do n't want to upset you or anything . I 'm just a little curious about why you asked us down here . That 's all . LUNA I do n't think he even remembers . MIAMI ( to HENRY ) Sure he remembers . Do n't you , Henry ? Did n't you say you wanted to take us flying ? ( HENRY looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( stares into space ) There was a song about that . MIAMI A song ? HENRY HACKAMORE A silver plane . MIAMI What song was that , Henry ? ( HENRY goes back to putting Kleenex on his legs . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( referring to LUNA ) She knows what song it was . She used to try to sing it . Used to think she was a singer . Even had me convinced . Spent a lot a ' money on that voice . MIAMI ( to LUNA ) You remember a song ? LUNA Not me . Musta ' been one of his rural discoveries . One of his quaint little waitress-types . HENRY HACKAMORE Turns out she could only sing two lines . That 's all she could memorize . Two lines . MIAMI I could sing something for you if you want me to . HENRY HACKAMORE You ? ( looks at MIAMI ) You ca n't sing , can ya ' ? MIAMI Sure . HENRY HACKAMORE You ca n't sing a note . I remember you . You could barely even talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry , you really are a pisser ! You know that ? A real charmer . HENRY HACKAMORE Okay , go ahead and sing something . Thrill me . MIAMI I think the moment 's past ! All the inspiration went right out the window ! HENRY HACKAMORE ( laughs ) Inspiration ! That 's great ! Inspiration . Well , that 's what ya ' get for relying on inspiration , sister ! LUNA Henry , is this going to be just another opportunity for you to indulge in insults ? What do you want from us ? Here we are . You sent for us and here we are . I 'm not willing to hang around here while you bombard us with your twisted little versions of injury . I did n't even know you were still alive until I got your telegram . HENRY HACKAMORE ( smiling to LUNA ) There 's still no way to be sure about that , is there ? ( Long pause . LUNA stares at him . He stares back . ) LUNA Well , you 're not are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? This situation is already getting me a little bit on edge . I think you owe us some kind of an explanation . HENRY HACKAMORE That 'd be nice , would n't it . A little explanation . That 'd be real nice . I tell ya ' what . We 'll have an exchange . You do a little explaining then I 'll do a little explaining . Stroke for stroke . That way none of us will be left out on a limb . p. 48 LUNA Well , there 's nothing to explain . You know all about me already . MIAMI What do you wan na ' know from us ? HENRY HACKAMORE I want to know what it 's been like . MIAMI What what 's been like ? ( Pause . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Life . Living . That 's simple enough , is n't it ? LUNA Life in general , you mean ? HENRY HACKAMORE No . Life in particular . What it smells like . What it tastes like . What it sounds like . LUNA Jesus Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LUNA You mean you 've been that cut off all these years ? ( HENRY suddenly goes back to the Kleenex and starts putting it on his legs again . The women move in toward him . ) LUNA ( after pause ) Henry , I 'm sorry . I 'll tell you anything you want to know . ( HENRY quickly looks up at MIAMI . ) HENRY HACKAMORE What about her ? LUNA What about her ? p. 49 HENRY HACKAMORE I need a commitment ! A pact . We all have to come into agreement . It 's no good if two of us are willing and the third one is n't . It 's the third one that always spoils everything ! It 's the third one that stabs you in the back ! That 's the one you have to watch out for ! MIAMI I agree already ! HENRY HACKAMORE It 's no good just saying it . The words mean nothing . The words just fly out and disappear into thin air . ( to LUNA ) Is n't that right ? LUNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure . If you 're not sure we ca n't proceed . You have to be absolutely sure . You have to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt ! We have to be in communion . Completely in communion ! LUNA All right ! What do you want , a contract ! HENRY HACKAMORE ( short pause ) A contract . LUNA Maybe we should all slash our wrists and drink each other 's blood or something ! I mean how far do you want to carry this thing ? HENRY HACKAMORE A contract sounds good . I 'll agree to that . ( The women look at each other and stifle a laugh. ) p. 50 LUNA All right , Henry . Let 's make a contract . You got a piece of paper or something ? HENRY HACKAMORE Paper 's filthy ! I do n't keep the stuff around . LUNA ( moving toward his manuscripts under chair ) You 've got papers underneath your chair there . HENRY HACKAMORE You stay away from that ! ( LUNA stops ) Just stay away ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) MIAMI Henry , maybe we could skip the contract thing . HENRY HACKAMORE No ! ( to MIAMI ) See , it 's you ! You ! You 're the one ! You 're the one who wants to stifle the project ! Turn around in fifty years and you 'll be sittin ' at the head of the table ! That 's the way you 'd like it , is n't it ? A flimsy verbal agreement . That way you can manipulate and twist things up any way you like . Well , I 'm not puttin ' one cent into this thing unless we have a contract . LUNA And we ca n't have a contract unless we have paper ! HENRY HACKAMORE Write it in the air ! LUNA ( short pause ) What ? HENRY HACKAMORE Write it in the air . ( The women break into laughter. ) p. 51 HENRY HACKAMORE Shut up ! ( they stop laughing ) Neither one of ya 's got the sense God gave a chicken ! City girls . Couple a ' dumb-ass city girls . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? Well I happen to have built an entire legacy on nothin ' but air ! ( Silence . ) HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right . Thin air . Invisible . Tiny little invisible molecules . Jet propulsion ! Whad'ya ' think about that ? The wings of a plane ? ( He stretches his arms out horizontally and slowly tips them from side to side . He smiles at the women . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Now , what happens when a thing moves through space ? What happens ? ( He lowers his arms very slowly . The women seem almost hypnotized by his movements now . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Do you see anything ? Do you see anything leaving a trail ? A path ? a ghost ? A memory of the movement ? It 's all being recorded . Is n't that something ? It 's all being left behind and you ca n't even see it . ( His arms finally come to rest at his sides . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Put your hand out in front of you . Your finger . ( LUNA stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. ) p. 52 HENRY HACKAMORE Both of you ! ( MIAMI does the same . ) HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right . Now  --  write the words . Write the words I tell you . In plain English . Bold print . I want to see the letters speak . Write this : " We agree  --  . " Write ! " We agree  --  . " ( The women write simultaneously in the air . HENRY squints to make out the invisible letters . ) HENRY HACKAMORE That 's right . " This day . " Go ahead . Write , " This day  --  . " ( The women continue writing the words in the air . HENRY watches closely . ) HENRY HACKAMORE " We agree  --  this day  --  to everything . " Write that ! " To everything . " ( The women finish writing the sentence . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Now sign it . Both of you . ( They sign their names in the air . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Now each of you sign the other one 's . ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a witness ! Countersign it ! Go ahead . ( They switch places and sign their names again. ) p. 53 HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Now I 'll put my sign here . ( HENRY makes a strange writing mark in midair and dots it . ) HENRY HACKAMORE There . Now that was painless , was n't it ? Perfunctory and painless . These things have to be taken care of . Now we can breathe a little more freely . Now that we know we 're protected . LUNA Henry , do you think we could get something to drink ? I 'm feeling a little bit dizzy . HENRY HACKAMORE Drink ? We do n't have anything to celebrate yet . A contract 's nothing to celebrate . I never went in for that stuff . MIAMI All right , let 's get this over with . What do you want us to do now ? HENRY HACKAMORE That 's not the attitude . This has to be a voluntary endeavor , otherwise it wo n't work . LUNA Could n't we raise the curtain or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how you stand it . HENRY HACKAMORE The curtains ? No ! It 's too distracting . LUNA Just to get a little sunlight in here . HENRY HACKAMORE No ! ( pause ) This is no vacation ! I did n't call ya ' down here just to dress up the furniture . There 's plenty a ' others I could 've called for that . You do n't seem to recognize the importance of this meeting . You two are my last link . My very last possibility . p. 54 MIAMI For what ? HENRY HACKAMORE For remembering . For bringing something back . Raul 's no good for that anymore . I used to depend on him . He used to give me regular reports . But now he 's gone sour . I need a woman 's version . Two women . Two is always better than one . Now let 's start with Las Vegas . That 's as good a place to start as any . How ' bout it ? MIAMI Vegas ? ( she looks at LUNA ) HENRY HACKAMORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been to Vegas since nineteen fifty-two . HENRY HACKAMORE ( to LUNA ) What about you ? LUNA ( to HENRY ) The last time I was there it was with you . HENRY HACKAMORE Me ? You were never there with me ! I woulda ' remembered that . LUNA Henry , this is going nowhere fast . Ca n't we play cards or something ? HENRY HACKAMORE No ! There 's no time for cards ! I 'm not lookin ' for diversions ! What'sa ' matter with you two ? Maybe you do n't have any experience . Nothin ' . Nothin ' to relate . Is that it ? A couple a ' zombies ? MIAMI All right . Las Vegas , nineteen fifty-two . p. 55 HENRY HACKAMORE You do n't have anything more recent , huh ? MIAMI Well , yeah . Sure . I got uh  --  New Orleans . I got some good Memphis stories . St. Louis . Take your pick . HENRY HACKAMORE Vegas . MIAMI Vegas it is . HENRY HACKAMORE It has to be Vegas . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell it . Down there . I wan na ' see you in the proper setting . MIAMI By the tree ? HENRY HACKAMORE Right . By the tree . ( to LUNA ) You come here . Come here and stand next to me . Over here . That 's right . ( LUNA crosses to HENRY , stands next to him . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( to LUNA ) Not too close . ( LUNA moves slightly away from HENRY , MIAMI has crossed down right to the palm tree . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( to MIAMI ) Move a little bit to your left ( MIAMI moves ) Not too much . Good . That 's it . Right there . Good . ( MIAMI stops ) Now when you tell this  --  when you start tellin ' this I want you to get real animated . Almost like uh  --  almost like you were in a movie . Ya ' know what I mean ? p. 56 MIAMI A movie ? HENRY HACKAMORE Yeah . Except more than a movie . MIAMI More ? HENRY HACKAMORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . Sort of reliving the experience of having been in Vegas . Ya ' see what I mean ? MIAMI I think so . HENRY HACKAMORE I do n't want you to just tell me some dumb story about some vague memory . I want to feel like I 'm actually there . MIAMI Okay . HENRY HACKAMORE If I do n't actually get the feeling of it then there 's no point in tellin ' it . Am I right ? MIAMI Right . HENRY HACKAMORE Okay . Now just relax . Are you ready ? MIAMI Ready . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . You may begin . MIAMI Thanks . ( takes deep breath , starts to tell story ) Well  --  uh  --  actually I remember the day I got hired as a chorus girl . HENRY HACKAMORE Tell about that . MIAMI I was in the hospital . I mean I 'd just gotten out of the hospital from hepatitis . I was still yellow . And my friend . This friend I had then . Her name was Ellen . She picked me up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the rest room and she started slapping makeup on me . She put rouge all over my face to take the yellow out . And she got me this dress . And she got me all dressed up and everything . So then we drove to this casino . p. 57 HENRY HACKAMORE Wait a second ! Wait a second ! I 'm not getting the feeling of this at all . I mean you 've got ta ' move around a lot more and make believe you 're actually there . MIAMI But I 'm not there ! HENRY HACKAMORE I know you 're not there . Just make believe you 're there . MIAMI But I ca n't make believe I 'm there when I 'm not there . HENRY HACKAMORE Just pretend . It 's easy . You can pretend anything . LUNA ( to MIAMI ) Go ahead . You might as well . HENRY HACKAMORE You 've just got to get into it a lot more . MIAMI All right ! Jesus , I did n't think I was coming here to do a fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Pause . MIAMI starts to tell the story again and tries to " act it out " for HENRY . ) MIAMI So we drove up to the casino . And we went inside . And there was this guy . He was a great big guy . HENRY HACKAMORE Wait ! Start over . MIAMI What 're you talking about ! HENRY HACKAMORE Start from the beginning again . p. 58 MIAMI From the hospital ? HENRY HACKAMORE Right . ( MIAMI takes a deep breath and starts again , trying to " act it out . " ) MIAMI I was in California . In the hospital . I 'd just gotten over having hepatitis . And this girl friend of mine picked me up and drove me to the airport . HENRY HACKAMORE The airport ? Last time it was the gas station . MIAMI ( crossing toward HENRY and LUNA ) I 'm not doing this ! Are you kidding ? HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to stop you but you did say the gas station the first time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not doing it anymore ! I 'm gone . I 'm tellin ' you , this guy is out of erasers as far as I 'm concerned . I did n't come down here to get rousted ! I do n't care whose charge account it lands on . Who in the fuck does this sonofabitch think he is ! Chargin ' around accusing me of double espionage ! The guy 's totally whacko ! ( she whips up her coat from the platform ) I came down here for a little vacation not a god-damn brain bath ! LUNA ( crossing down center ) I 'll do it ! p. 59 HENRY HACKAMORE Good ! That 's the spirit ! That 's exactly the kind of enthusiasm we need around here . That 's what 's been missing . ( to MIAMI ) You come and stay here and we 'll watch her do it . LUNA ( to HENRY ) You want another Vegas story ? Is that it ? HENRY HACKAMORE I do n't want another Vegas story . I want the same Vegas story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference does it make ? It 's a good story . One story 's as good as another . It 's all in the way you tell it . That 's what counts . That 's what makes the difference . LUNA You want me to tell you her story ? HENRY HACKAMORE Why not ? LUNA Because I do n't know what her story is . HENRY HACKAMORE Make it up . It 's all the same . LUNA You want me to pretend that I 'm her ? HENRY HACKAMORE Just take a plunge and stop pussyfooting around ! ( LUNA starts " acting out " the story for HENRY . ) LUNA All right . Let 's see . I 'd just gotten out of the hospital and I was very yellow . Still very yellow . And a good friend of mine named Ellen picked me up and drove me to a Shell station . p. 60 HENRY HACKAMORE ( to MIAMI ) She remembers it better than you . LUNA ( continuing story ) First of all she washed off my face . And I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she felt sorry for me . Like she was taking pity on me . Then she started putting makeup on me . All kinds of makeup . Green eye shadow and rouge and lipstick . I looked like a different woman . HENRY HACKAMORE ( to MIAMI ) Now we 're getting somewhere . You see ? You see what it takes ? LUNA ( continuing ) Then she drove me out to the airport and put me on a plane for Montreal . MIAMI ( interrupting ) No , it was n't Montreal . It was Vegas . First it was Vegas . HENRY HACKAMORE ( to MIAMI ) Let her tell it the way she wants to tell it ! MIAMI Look , it 's my story ! If she 's gon na tell my story she 's got ta ' tell it right . HENRY HACKAMORE ( to LUNA ) All right . Just change it to Vegas . LUNA ( checking with MIAMI ) It was Vegas first ? p. 61 MIAMI That 's right . Vegas first . Then Montreal . LUNA ( continues story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this casino and there was this great big guy sitting on a tall red stool in the bar . I told him I 'd come for the auditions . He sent me into a back room . Introduced me to this ballet instructor who teaches me a few basic steps . Then they send me into another room where the guy who does the hiring is . And he looks at my legs . All the usual stuff . Says , " Fine . " And I 'm on my way to Montreal . HENRY HACKAMORE What about the airport ? LUNA First I went to the airport and got on a plane and flew to Montreal . HENRY HACKAMORE No , no , no ! ! It does n't make sense ! It 's got ta ' make some kind of sense ! It 's too confusing . First you 're in Montreal then you 're in Vegas . What the hell 's goin ' on here ! ( HENRY suddenly gets alarmed ) Wait a second ! Who are you people ! ( MIAMI moves away from HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RAUL ! SOMEBODY 'S BROKEN IN HERE ! RAUL ! ( HENRY scrambles for the brass bell as he continues yelling for RAUL . He enters and carries a World War I leather aviator 's jacket , leather helmet , blue silk scarf and goggles over one arm . HENRY continues ringing the bell with his back to the platform , unaware of the activity behind him . Stops ringing the bell . RAUL holds out the jacket , helmet and goggles to HENRY . HENRY stares at them. ) p. 62 HENRY HACKAMORE ( to RAUL ) What the hell 's that ? RAUL It 's the best I could come up with . Hard to find this stuff nowadays . ( HENRY grabs the gear out of RAUL 'S hands , moves back on his chair . HENRY glares at the two women then turns to RAUL . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Did you invite these women in here ? RAUL No , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE I want them out of here ! Right now ! I want them outa ' here ! RAUL Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping towards HENRY ) Wait a second  --  HENRY HACKAMORE ( violently , trembling with rage ) Out ! Out ! Out ! Out ! Out ! ( HENRY is gasping for breath and passes out . RAUL moves to him , tries to calm him down , rubbing his shoulders . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Who in the hell 's making the decisions around here anyway ! RAUL Only you , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Only me ? RAUL Yes , sir . p. 63 HENRY HACKAMORE There 's no one over my head somewhere ? Somewhere lurking ? RAUL Not a soul , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE How can you be sure of that , Raul ? How can you be absolutely positive ? These women did n't come on my invitation ! That 's impossible ! RAUL It may have been an oversight , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE An oversight ! I ca n't afford an oversight ! Not now . RAUL We wo n't let them out of the building without a thorough interrogation . HENRY HACKAMORE Something 's happening , Raul . Something 's happening that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE I mean  --  the earth . Is the earth shaking ? ( sudden panic ) Is that the earth shaking , Raul ! ( RAUL presses firmly on HENRY 'S shoulders . ) RAUL There 's nothing shaking , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE That sound ! There 's a sound ! Down here the earth opens up sometimes . From time to time it swallows people . I 've heard of that . RAUL It 's all right , sir . There 's no sound . p. 64 HENRY HACKAMORE Do n't tell me there 's no sound ! Listen to that ! Just listen . ( RAUL and HENRY listen . Silence . ) RAUL There 's nothing , sir . ( HENRY keeps listening . Long pause . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Is there someone watching me , Raul ? Is that what it is ? RAUL No one 's watching you , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Someone has to be watching me . I would n't feel this uneasy otherwise . RAUL Would you like some more plasma , sir ? HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give it a stir before you bring it in here . RAUL Yes , sir . ( RAUL rushes off to get the blood . Women follow . HENRY 'S left alone . He puts the blue scarf around his neck . He stares out at his palm trees . His eyes go from one palm to the other . He climbs off his chair and makes his way down to the stage-right palm slowly , his arm reaching out in front of him . He talks to the palms . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( as he walks toward palm ) Stop that shaking ! Stop that ! It 's not necessary at a time like this . I 'll tell you when to shake . You shake when I shake ! The earth 's not shaking so why should you . ( HENRY reaches the palm and grabs it with both hands as though to hold it still . He releases it and stands back . Looks at palm . Looks across at the other one. ) p. 65 HENRY HACKAMORE That 's better . Both of you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Both of you 'd agree to that . I 'm not completely at the end of my rope . There 's other lives yet . More to come . ( He darts a look at the stage-left palm . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( to palm ) Stop that shaking ! ( he crosses quickly to the down-left palm ) Stop it ! There 's no reason for it . No reason at all . ( He grabs the stage-left palm and steadies it the same as he did to the other one . When he 's satisfied with the palm 's stability he stands back and talks to it . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( to palm ) I have enough premonitions already without you creating more . The earth is firm . Temporarily firm . Once I take off , then it can fall apart . You can shake all you want to then . ( pause . HENRY slowly tilts his head back and stares up at the sky ) What 's that moving ? You feel that ? There 's something moving . Clouds . A fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound ? Thundering . Blue steel . They 're trying to leave without me ! ( HENRY suddenly panics . Moves center stage . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( yelling ) Raul ! They 're evacuating the country without me ! The President 's leaving ! The generals ! They 're trying to maroon me again ! Abandon me to the elements ! Raul ! Where are my women ! Get me my women before it 's too late ! Raul ! ( RAUL comes rushing on with the intravenous rack and a fresh bottle of blood . He leaves the rack by the chair and moves down to HENRY , helping him back center stage to the chair. ) p. 66 RAUL ( helping HENRY walk ) You should n't get out of your chair , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Where are my women ! What 's happened to my women ! RAUL I brought you some fresh blood , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE We 've got to get out of this place before the tidal wave . There is a tidal wave . You know that , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Nevada . I have inside information . Tribal information . RAUL Yes , sir . ( RAUL helps him back onto the chair , inserts the I.V . needle into HENRY 'S arm and tapes it down . HENRY continues talking . ) HENRY HACKAMORE Las Vegas is on holy ground . Proof positive . I have definite verification on that . RAUL Just relax , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Problem is the transit . Keeping it secret . Absolute secret . A black plane . Do we have the black plane ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE The jumbo ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE No markings of any kind ? p. 67 RAUL None , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Radar spoiler ? RAUL Yes , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Zero to touchdown ? RAUL That 's right , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE So I 'm to believe you 've covered all the variables then ? RAUL Who else can you believe , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE ( pause ) That 's right . Who else . ( he picks up leather jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just like what you used to wear . HENRY HACKAMORE You mean this is stand-in gear ? Dummy gear ? RAUL Your original stuff exploded with that pilot over Nebraska . HENRY HACKAMORE We do n't talk about that ! RAUL I 'm sorry , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm not supposed to hear about that ! RAUL I forgot . HENRY HACKAMORE Help me on with this stuff . You put it on me . RAUL Yes , sir . ( RAUL puts the goggles on over HENRY 'S eyes , then the helmet . He helps HENRY on with the jacket , leaving the one sleeve loose over the intravenous arm. ) p. 68 HENRY HACKAMORE Why am I shaking , Raul ? Why am I constantly shaking ? RAUL You 're shaking less than you used to , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm not getting better , am I ? I 'm getting worse . RAUL You 'll be fine once we get across the border . HENRY HACKAMORE Why should the border make any difference ? I wo n't be safe until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred ground . RAUL You 'll be fine , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE You think I can still handle that plane ? After all these years ? RAUL It may be a little ambitious , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Ambitious ? Of course it 's ambitious ! What 's that got to do with it ? RAUL I just meant physically , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Physically ? Physically . It 's hard to believe I 've still got a body left . RAUL The doctors say you 're on the upswing . HENRY HACKAMORE The doctors ! Those Mexican goons ? RAUL They 're not Mexican , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE They 're not American , either ! This country 's not fit for a man to get sick in . There ought a ' be a law against falling ill in a foreign country . A man 's got a right to die in his homeland . p. 69 RAUL You 're not dying yet , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE How can you live down here with monkeys crawling all over your food ! Mosquitoes poisoning the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Those women are probably already contacting the papers . Blabbing about my whereabouts . RAUL They have n't left yet , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE Good . Keep them under surveillance . Constant surveillance . This is an evil time , Raul . Much worse than what I grew up in . Much , much worse . You 've lost touch with things but I 've still got the old inner radar to depend on . Still got the jump on the world at large . RAUL I 've always respected your vision , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE My vision ? That 's right . My vision . I still see . Even in the dark , I still see . Do you want to know what I see , Raul ? It 's the same thing I saw in Texas when I was a boy . The same thing I 've always seen . I saw myself . Alone . Standing in open country . Flat , barren . Wasted . As far as the eyes could take in . Enormous country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward me . As though men did n't belong there . As though men were a joke in the face of it . I heard rattlesnakes laughing . Coyotes . Cactus stabbing the blue air . Miles of heat and wind and red rock where nothing grew but the sand . And far off , invisible little men were huddled against it in cities . In tiny towns . In organizations . Protected . I saw the whole world of men as pathetic . Sad , demented little morons moving in circles . Always in the same circles . Always away from the truth . Getting smaller and smaller until they finally disappeared . p. 70 RAUL I think your plane is ready , sir . Is there any business you want to finish before we leave ? HENRY HACKAMORE Business ? What business ? My business is finished . RAUL Your will , sir ? HENRY HACKAMORE My will ? That 's been decided . Everything goes to you , Raul . That 's already been decided . RAUL But there 's nothing on paper , sir . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Air 's the only thing that 'll last forever . RAUL But the lawyers wo n't honor that , sir . HENRY HACKAMORE The lawyers ! All the lawyers are good for is stealing you blind ! They all work for the government . They 're the ones who took my planes . Stole my planes right out from under me ! ( RAUL suddenly pulls his pistol on HENRY , points it at his chest . HENRY stares at him . Pause . ) RAUL ( quiet and firm ) I want something written on paper . Proof positive . I want it written in blood . HENRY HACKAMORE What is this ! ( RAUL moves into him suddenly and violently rips the intravenous drip from his arm . HENRY screams . RAUL holds the needle as blood spurts from it onto the floor . He holds the gun on HENRY with the other hand. ) p. 71 RAUL Get your papers out , Henry . Under the bed . HENRY HACKAMORE You ca n't do this to me ! There 's others over your head ! RAUL There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HACKAMORE You 're nothing but a bodyguard . A servant ! What 're you doing this for ? I already told you it all goes to you . Do n't you take me at my word ? RAUL Nobody takes you at your word , Henry . Your word means nothing . HENRY HACKAMORE I can have you annihilated in a second ! RAUL By who ? By what ? You 're nothing . You 're not even a ghost . You do n't even exist , Henry . You 've disappeared off the face of the earth . Nobody can trace you . We 've made sure of that . HENRY HACKAMORE I still have my executives ! My trustees . RAUL Nobody . Nothing . It all stops at me . HENRY HACKAMORE What 've you done behind my back ! What 've you done to me ! RAUL I 've kept you alive for years and years . I 've carried you on stretchers . I 've cooked your spinach . I 've bought you ice cream cones in the middle of the night . I 've held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , Henry . That 's what I 've done . p. 72 HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm not signing anything ! I 'm not making anything final ! RAUL You still do n't believe it , do you ? HENRY HACKAMORE Believe what ? RAUL That you 're dying . You 're finished . This is it , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE You ca n't kill me ! You ca n't murder me ! RAUL I can do anything I want , Henry . Anything . I can fabricate any story . Make up any lie . Have you disappear in London . Reappear in Brazil . HENRY HACKAMORE That was n't you ! It was me ! I was making the decisions ! Only me ! RAUL That 's why it worked so beautifully , Henry . Because you believed it . Every suggestion we made , you believed it was your idea . That everything originated from you . The sole stockholder ! The one and only Henry Malcolm Hackamore . HENRY HACKAMORE I invented everything ! My planes ! My hotels ! RAUL But not your life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shaped it for you . At first to suit your needs . And then to suit mine . HENRY HACKAMORE You 're a maniac ! RAUL You ca n't make a move without me . Stand up ! ( pause . HENRY stares at him , still sitting on chair ) STAND UP ! ( HENRY stands . RAUL smiles ) That 's right Henry . That 's right . Now pull out your papers and put them on the chair . ( HENRY pauses , then does what he 's told . He pulls out the box of manuscripts and sets it on the chair . He turns to RAUL. ) p. 73 HENRY HACKAMORE I ca n't understand why you do n't trust me . I ca n't understand it . I already told you I 'd give you everything . ( RAUL moves to the box and starts pulling out the manuscripts . He hards the intravenous needle , still spurting blood , to HENRY . HENRY takes it . ) RAUL ( handing needle ) Take this . ( thumbing through manuscripts ) This is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where you give it away . All the secrets . All the treasures . This is what the world will believe . When they see it in black and white . the spreads manuscripts out on chair ) Now sign it . Every copy . Sign it with the needle . ( WOMEN enter ) I 've arranged for a few witnesses . I hope you do n't mind . ( MIAMI and LUNA 'S laughter is heard offstage , then the soft background sound of 40 's dance music . The WOMEN come onto the upstage platform slowly , dancing cheek to cheek with the two DOCTORS . The GANGSTER follows behind , peering down from the platform at HENRY . The music is " You Belong to Me " where the lyrics go " Fly the ocean in a silver plane , " etc . HENRY watches the group on the platform then turns to RAUL . He still holds the needle with the blood dripping out of it. ) p. 74 HENRY HACKAMORE ( to RAUL ) Will I still be able to fly ? RAUL Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . HENRY HACKAMORE I want to see Nevada again . Vegas . Vegas is the only place that makes sense . I ca n't die without seeing Vegas . RAUL You 'll see it , Henry . Do n't worry . ( HENRY starts signing the manuscripts with the dripping needle . The WOMEN look down at him over the shoulders of the doctors . The GANSTER watches HENRY closely . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I 've never signed my life away before . There 's nothing to it . No pain . Nothing . RAUL It should be a great relief . HENRY HACKAMORE I do n't feel a thing . It 's as though it never happened . A whole life . Where 's the proof , Raul ? Where 's the proof ? RAUL Just sign . Just keep signing . ( HENRY continues signing the papers . The blood pours across the pages onto the floor . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I could 've made the whole thing up . Any story I wanted . It 's not even my blood , is it ? RAUL By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , Henry . p. 75 HENRY HACKAMORE ( starts to panic again ) It 's not even my hand ! My body ! Whose body is this ! RAUL ( moving in with gun ) Just sign , Henry . Just settle down and sign . ( HENRY continues signing papers . RAUL hovers around him . The platform action continues to the music . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( signing ) In a second I see it . I see it now . RAUL What do you see ? HENRY HACKAMORE I see how I disappeared . It happened a long time ago . A long , long time ago . RAUL Where was it , Henry ? HENRY HACKAMORE Texas . That 's the last time I lived on this earth . Texas . I disappeared in a dream . I dreamed myself into another shape . Another body . I made myself up . RAUL Keep signing , Henry . HENRY HACKAMORE It happened in a second . In a flash . I was taken by the dream and all the time I thought I was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost like rape . You could call it rape . I gave myself up . Sold it all down the river . RAUL It 's too late to regret it now , Henry . p. 76 HENRY HACKAMORE But I still get to fly , do n't I ? You 're still going to let me fly ? RAUL Climb into the cockpit , Henry . Everything 's waiting . ( HENRY starts climbing onto his chair to a standing position facing the audience as RAUL collects the manuscripts and piles them into the GANGSTER 'S arms who 's waiting on the platform . The blood drips from them onto the floor . The WOMEN keep dancing slowly with the DOCTORS as the music continues underneath . As HENRY climbs the chair , LUNA starts singing the words of the song , softly , as she dances . ) LUNA ( singing softly ) " Fly the ocean in a silver plane See the jungle when it 's wet with rain Just remember till you 're home again You belong to me See the pyramids along the Nile . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY 'S voice . RAUL stays by HENRY , looking up at him , his pistol still drawn . The full moon in the background starts to slowly turn orange as the sky grows darker to the end of the act . ) HENRY HACKAMORE ( standing on the chair ) It 's pitch black out here . Perfect . Perfect for escape . I think we did the right thing , Raul . I can slip back in . No one will ever know the difference . They 'll say I existed somewhere . A face . A name . No one will ever know for sure . You can take my place now . You can have it . p. 77 RAUL You 'll never escape , Henry . You 're standing on your bed . You 'll never get out of here . HENRY HACKAMORE ( slowly spreading his arms as though flying ) I 've already left . I 've gone . Come and gone . Just like that . Every seed I ever planted is growing . Look ! ( he points far below him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oil ! Las Vegas ! Look at Las Vegas , Raul ! It 's glowing in the dark ! RAUL You 're nowhere , Henry ! HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm everywhere ! All at once I 'm everywhere ! I 'm all over the country . I 'm over Nevada ! ( RAUL points the pistol at HENRY as HENRY soars on the chair with his arms spread . The sky gets darker . The moon grows red . LUNA 'S singing fades out . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm high over the desert ! Invisible . A ghost in the land . No voice . No sound . A phantom they 'll never get rid of . RAUL You 're dead , Henry ! You 're dead ! Lay down and die ! ( RAUL fires the pistol at HENRY . The WOMEN and the DOCTORS rush offstage . The music continues softly . HENRY does n't die . He keeps flying . RAUL points the pistol at HENRY 'S head. ) p. 78 HENRY HACKAMORE I 'm the demon they invented ! Everything they ever aspired to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raul ! Only me ! ( RAUL fires again . HENRY keeps raving and flying . He seems to get stronger with every blast of the pistol . RAUL goes down on his knees below HENRY , keeps firing at him but ca n't kill him . ) HENRY HACKAMORE I can move anywhere I want to now . Freer than life . Flying . My body 's gone . You ca n't even see me now . Nothing can see me . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . I 'm dead to the world but I never been born . ( repeat-fade with lights ) ( As HENRY chants the lines , repeating the rhythm , his body slowly sways from side to side as his arms drop slowly to his sides . This should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chant . RAUL finally gives up firing the pistol and collapses forward on his knees in a gesture of supplication . The lights fade to black with the full moon remaining dark red behind the silhouette of HENRY standing on the chair . The voice of HENRY fades in the dark. )
