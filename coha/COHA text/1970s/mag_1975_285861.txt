At Paris ' elegant Hotel Ritz , the champagne flowed until the small hours . Beaming U.S. Air Force generals mingled with aircraft executives and diplomats . The party 's host , General Dynamics Corp . of St. Louis , had every reason to splurge . After more than a year of knee-and-gouge competition , Belgium had decided to buy the company 's F-16 fighter-interceptor instead of the French Dassault Mirage F1-M53 as a replacement for aging U.S. F-104 Starfighters . That clinched what everyone was calling " the arms deal of the century . " <P> Belgium had been the holdout in a NATO consortium that also includes Norway , Denmark and The Netherlands . Once the Belgians decided , General Dynamics was assured of sales to the four countries of 348 planes worth $2.1 billion . That will be in addition to the 650 F-16s already ordered by the U.S. Air Force as its new generation of fighters for the 1980s . General Dynamics estimated that the 998-plane sale could create 40,000 jobs in the U.S. , plus thousands more in the four NATO countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly Iran , opt for the trim Mach 2-plus ( 1,500 m.p.h. ) craft , total production could reach almost 1,500 planes worth $9.1 billion . The agreed " not-to-exceed " price of $6.09 million ( v. $5.5 million for the Mirage ) per basic airplane , could , if 1,500 planes are in fact sold , add $4.3 billion to the credit side of the U.S. trade balance during the next ten years . The long-range total could be even higher ; such extras as spare parts and technical additions could boost the per-plane price to $7.6 million . <P> The French were understandably angry . Although the F-16 was clearly superior , the Mirage was a smart performer itself and had other things going for it , among them a large number of French-speaking Belgians who would be outraged at a decision to choose the F16 . But not even that consideration could outweigh aggressive salesmanship by General Dynamics and the U.S. Government . In the final hours before the decision , U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger sagely offered Belgian policymakers a rationale for buying the F-16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Belgian Defense Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants assurances that the U.S. would consider buying $30 million worth of Belgian machine guns , which happen to be made in the French-speaking portion of Belgium .
