Steve Cauthen and Affirmed win the Belmont and the title <P> They did it . The kid and the colt , Steve Cauthen and Affirmed , became the eleventh winners of the Triple Crown of American Thoroughbred racing last Saturday by taking one of the most thrilling races in the history of the sport . They measured up to the demanding 1-mile Belmont Stakes- " test of the champions " - and moved into the most select circle of racing royalty . Affirmed 's honor was made grander still by the rousing challenge of his gallant rival , Alydar , who shadowed Harbor View Farm 's chestnut in lockstep around the graceful , sweeping turns and down the long , open straightaways of New York 's Belmont Park . At the wire , Affirmed won this race of matchless drama by a head . <P> The five-horse field got away cleanly , Cauthen steering Affirmed into an immediate , if slow-paced lead . Alydar 's trainer , John Veitch , had feared a repeat of Affirmed 's easy gallop on the lead at the Preakness and planned to up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race once more . Said Veitch : " Alydar will be Affirmed 's shadow . " <P> And so he was . On the second turn , with slightly less than a mile to run , Jockey Jorge Velasquez moved Alydar up on the outside and parked his big , handsome colt on Affirmed 's right shoulder . Down the long backstretch the two colts ran stride for stride , coats glistening in the big move to the finish . The field was already left far behind . Affirmed and Alydar flew out of the final turn and into the home stretch , driving for the wire , joined in desperate struggle . With 3/16 of a mile to go , Alydar pushed in front by a nose , but Affirmed , running now on heart , reclaimed the lead with 20 yds. left . They thundered home , two great colts running in splendor . When it was over , Steve Cauthen put the dimensions of their duel with eloquent simplicity : " This was a horse race . " <P> By winning the Belmont , Affirmed added $110,580 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the youngest millionaire in racing history . His victory came a year and a day after Seattle Slew won his crown . The two colts are the first back-to-back Triple Crown winners in racing history , and , with Secretariat ( 1973 ) , the second and third in six seasons . The remarkable conjunction marks a halcyon period for the three-year-olds ' classics . Eleven years passed between the first winner , Sir Barton ( 1919 ) . and Gallant Fox ( 1930 ) ; a full quarter-century separated the triumphs of Citation ( 1948 ) and Secretariat . <P> The odds on a colt 's matching the demands of the Triple Crown are long enough to fire larceny in a bettor 's soul and break a breeder 's heart . Almost 30,000 Thoroughbreds are foaled annually on North American farms , but only about 3% ever win a stakes race , much less one of the Triple Crown races . Breeding Thoroughbreds is far from an exact science .
