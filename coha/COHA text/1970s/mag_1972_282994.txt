Since Jefferson 's day , the U.S. Senate has had a rule that no member can be absent from its sessions without permission . That quaint regulation is in a class with the custom that a gentleman always dresses for dinner or walks on the lady 's curb side . <P> Taxpayers give Senators $42,500 a year , along with generous travel and stationery allowances , to attend to the nation 's legislative business . But in the men's-club atmosphere of the Senate , absenteeism is something of a way of life . Constituents ' demands , to be sure , must be met-along with campaign obligations . Many Senators are also called away by the lucrative lecture circuit . Several weeks ago , Majority Leader Mike Mansfield said angrily : " The record is abominable . None of us was drafted for this job . " <P> When the Senate was in the midst of a historic debate on school busing last week , 17 Senators missed a crucial vote on the antibusing Griffin amendment ( see story , page 25 ) . If four Democratic presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vance Hartke - had been present , the amendment , passed by 43-40 , might have been defeated . ( Hubert Humphrey was also absent , but he had " paired " with another missing member , Louisiana 's Russell Long , so that their offsetting votes would not have mattered . ) <P> The episode gave some emphasis to a proposal by Maine 's Senator Margaret Chase Smith . She has suggested a constitutional amendment that would expel any Senator who misses more than 40% of the Senate 's votes .
