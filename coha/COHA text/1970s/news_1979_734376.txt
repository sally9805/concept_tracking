txt WASHINGTON f l  --  The FBI admitted Friday that in Mu it spread gossip that actress Jean Seherg , who committed suicide recently , had become pregnant by a member of the Black Panther Party . The bureau released an internal memorandum that showed it had sought to discredit Miss Seberg because she supported the black nationalist cause . ' It is felt that the possible publication of Seberg 's plight could cause her embarrassment and serve to cheapen her image with the general public , " the memorandum said . Her husband at the time , Romain Gary , a French diplomat and author , charged earlier this week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation destroyed Miss Seberg 's life by disseminating the rumor about her pregnancy . Miss Seberg had a stillborn baby ; Gary said he always believed the child seas his , and he said the child was white . The information about Miss Seberg was distributed by the FBI as part of its counterintelligence program known as Cointelpro . IN ACKNOWLEDGING the bureau 's action , FBI Director William Webster asserted Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat advocates of unpopular causes have long since passed . We are out that business forever . " He said the FBI conducts Investigations now only when there have been charges of criminal conduct . Government documents show that in the memo , dated Aprll 27 , 1070 , the Los Angeles office of the FBI asked bureau Jean Seberg headquarters in Washington for permission " to publicize the pregnancy of Jean Seberg , well-known movie actress .. . by advising Hollywood gossip columnists // FBI admits smear plot against actress // in the Los Angeles area of the situation . " The references to a member of the Black Panther Party who the FBI said fathered the child were deleted , as was the name of the FBI informant who initially provided the tip to the FBI office in San Francisco . The Los Angeles office of the FBI suggested that the best way to get the story out would be to have a fictitious person send a note to Hollywood columnists about Miss Seberg . The proposed note would read as follows : " I WAS JUST thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I was in Paris last week and ran into Jean Seberg , who was heavy with baby . I thought she and Romain had gotten together again , but she confided the child belonged to blank space of the Black Panthers . The dear girl is getting around . " On May 6 , 1970 , the FBI , then under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover , responded that the idea was a good one . " But to protect the sensitive source of information from possible compromise and to insure the success of your plan , Bureau feels it would be better to wait approximately two additional months until Seberg 's pregnancy would be obvious to everyone , " the memo said . It noted that " Jean Seberg has been a financial supporter of the BPP Black Panther Party and should be neutralized . The current pregnancy by blank space while still married affords an opportunity for such effort . " ON MAY 19 , 1970 , the Los Angeles Times published an article by Hollywood gossip columnist Joyce Haber referring to an anonymous " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Black Revolution " and who ' ' is expecting . . . . Papa 's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther . " The Haber article provided a number of details that matched Miss Seberg 's personal and professional life . Gary , the actress ' former husband , charged this week that " Jean Seberg was destroyed by the FBI " because of publication of the rumor . He said that in 1970 , while they were in the process of getting a divorce , she read the article . In an interview earlier this year , Miss Seberg said she was seven months pregnant when she read the article and the shock was so great that it caused her to go into labor immediately , and the child was dead at birth . GARY SAID THAT as a result of this she " became psychotic , " and " every year on the anniversary of this stillbirth she has tried to take her own life . " Mrs. Haber , who no longer writes gossip columns for the Los Angeles Times , said Friday she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip originated with the FBI . She said that if she had known that at the time , she would have never used the information " even blind , " a term for a gossip item used without naming persons . " I think that is invasion of privacy , " she said . " I think it is horrible . That plant was given me by someone who is very reliable  --  a journalist . " She refused to disclose the person 's name . Miss Seberg 's body was found last Saturday night in her car near the Paris apartment she had been sharing with an Algerian actor . She had been missing for nine days and had left a suicide note for her 16-year-old son , Diego . THE CAUSE of death was an overdose of barbiturates a doctor had prescribed for psychiatric problems . Miss Seberg was buried in Paris ' Montparnasse Cemetery Friday . About 200 persons , including Gary and two other former husbands of the actress , were present for the funeral service .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
