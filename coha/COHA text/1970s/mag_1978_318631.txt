Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night can stay the P.H. Brennan Hand Delivery Service from its appointed rounds , but the U.S. Postal Service has finally succeeded in doing so . For more than two years , Patricia and Paul Brennan delivered first-class mail along with other papers and parcels in downtown Rochester , N.Y . For 10 a letter , they guaranteed same-day delivery and served close to 400 satisfied clients . <P> The U.S. Postal Service , charging that the Brennans violated its statutory monopoly on first-class mail , filed suit last year to close them down . A federal judge ruled against them , and as appeals were heard , the Brennans operated on a day-to-day basis . <P> Last week , the Brennans were told that the federal court of appeals had denied a stay , and they sadly closed . Mrs. Brennan will make a final appeal to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall , but a reversal seems unlikely . The last Postal Service competitor who tried to deliver first-class mail , in Pittsburg , Kans. , was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied a rehearing .
