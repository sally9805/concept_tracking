BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE by Dee Brown . 487 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . $10.95 . <P> <P> On Dec. 29 , 1890 , nearly 500 troopers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry opened fire on a bedraggled band of Minneconjou Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek , S. Dak . When the last carbine bullet splattered to a stop and the final Hotchkiss shell exploded , more than half the 350 Indian men , women and children were dead . Many were slaughtered as they lay wounded in their tents . Others were hunted down in the surrounding gullies . The massacre concluded with a heavy snowfall that shrouded the dead and closed one of the most distorted periods in U.S. history . <P> After Wounded Knee , the Plains Indians never again offered serious armed resistance to the manifestors of American destiny . Decades of worthless treaties , search-and-destroy missions , pacification programs , enforced relocations and free-fire zones ended there . The remnants of the Sioux , Cheyenne , Apache and other tribes were concentrated on unfertile , game-poor reservations , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , malnutrition and melancholia . <P> It is not an unfamiliar story . In the last decade or so , after almost a century of saloon art and horse operas that romanticized Indian fighters and white settlers , Americans have been developing a reasonably acute sense of the injustices and humiliations suffered by the Indians . But the details of how the West was won are not really part of the American consciousness . This is hardly unusual . Despite the need to establish credit with the future , people and nations rarely acknowledge their debts to the past . <P> Like a number of scholars , novelists and moviemakers , Dee Brown , Western historian and head librarian at the University of Illinois , now attempts to balance the account . With the zeal of an IRS investigator , he audits U.S. history 's forgotten set of books . Compiled from old but rarely exploited sources plus a fresh look at dusty Government documents . Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee tallies the broken pronrses ' tnd treaties , the provocations , massacres . discriminatory policies and condescending diplomacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes , illuminated by flashes of courage and desperate efforts to res ; st slow annihilation . There were the brilliantly waged wars of chiefs Red Cloud . Little Crow . Crazy Horse and Gall , as well as stoic efforts to save their people by Sitting Bull and Black Kettle . <P> In an attempt to see history through Indian eyes , Brown liberally enlists the embittered eloquence of the Indians themselves . Following the clich , most of them actually do speak " with heavy hearts " about their betrayals . Some , like Chief Joseph of the Nez Percs. are sharply ironic . " We do not want churches , " he told a white agent . " They will teach us to quarrel about God . We may quarrel with men sometimes about things on this earth , but we never quarrel about God . "
