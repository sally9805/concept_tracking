txt President Ford called for a shift of emphasis from protecting criminals ' rights to insuring the rights of their victims , as he asked Congress Thursday to enact new laws that would impose mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain kinds of crimes . In his long-awaited crime message to Congress , the President promised that states would be assisted in cracking down on " the kind of brutal violence that makes us fearful of strangers and afraid to go out at night . " Among the reforms Ford sought were minimum sentences for certain violent and dangerous crimes and for certain multiple offenders , cash assistance . for certain crime victims , and action that could lead to a ban on " Saturday Night Specials . " THE PRESIDENT stopped short of Atty . Gen. Edward Levi 's plan to forbid handguns in high-population high-crime areas . He did , however , call for immediate hiring of 500 federal agents to enforce gun laws in the nation 's 10 largest cities . At least 50 of the agents would be assigned to Chicago , Justice Department spokesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Department 's Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms Bureau , would be authorized to trace weapons from the streets of Chicago back to their sellers , often out-of  --  state . Chicago police do n't have that authority . FEDERAL law prohibits the sale of a firearm to a person who lives where a particular weapon is illegal . The federal agents would be empowered to arrest suburban and downstate gun traders who sell handguns to Chicagoans , where the weapons are banned . For example , said Justice Department officials , if a person who lives in Chicago bought a handgun in Oak Park both the dealer and the buyer would be the target of the agents . The Ford bill also would require a review of the nation 's 100,000 federally licensed gun dealers to weed out all except reputable dealers who sell to sportsmen and law enforcement people . FORD ALSO said that man-1 datory sentences should be given to all those convicted of violent crimes . He cited a study of one unidentified court system , whore " of all convicted robbers with a major prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being convicted . " Altho the length of the mandatory sentence has not been decided , Levi told reporters Thursday that it could be as short as six months . The " impoftant thing , " Levi said , is " th4e should be no doubt in the minds of those who commit violence that they will be sent to prison . " Among those subject to the mandatory sentences would be repeat offenders " with or without a weapon , " airplane hijackers , kidnappers , andidrug traffickers . FORD ALSO ordered the Justice Department to define the meaning of " Saturday Night Special " after which legislation could be introduced to ban such weapons . Justice Department officials said that such a definition will include barrel length , quality of materials used , and the safety devices on a gun . However , Ford added , " I am unalterably opposed to Federal registration of guns or gun owners . " In addition to attacking criminal possession of guns , Ford said mandatory sentencing of all persons convicted of violent crimes will help turn around the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , marking the worst upturn in American street crime since the Federal Bureau of Investigation began keeping statistics , Ford said . " The victims are my primary concern , " Ford told Congress . " That is why I do not talk about law and order and why I turn to the Constitutional guarantee of domestic tranquility . " Funds to compensate victims for medical costs and lost wages would come from the ; 15 million in fines paid annually to federal courts , and 20 per cent of the profits earned by convicts . Justice Department sources said that the maximum payment available would be about $50,000 . LEVI said that the administration will expand a pilot pre-trial diversion program now being tested in Chicago , to help courts give more attention to hardened criminals . The Chicago project ; which has handled 100 persons , places first offenders  --  especially young people  --  directly into rehabilitation programs . They stand trial only if rehabilitation fails . Ford also proposed the addition of 51 Federal District Court judges . The administration also proposes spending $200 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to impose a prison sentence , " Ford said .
