txt The Canadian Government today Introduced a bill to prohibit all advertising and promotion of cigarettes as of next Jan. 1 Passage of the legislation seemed assured . The United States prohibited cigarette advertising on radio and television as of Jan. 2 . Britain did so in 1965 . Canada 's ban would go be-1 yond broadcasting to include newspapers , magazines and any other type of direct advertising except the display of cigarettes where they are sold . The law would not apply to foreign publications distributed in Canada . The bill , introduced in the House of Commons , would also empower the Government to establish maximum tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes . The actual levels in each brand would have to be printed on the package . In addition , the bill would prohibit such promotions as coupons and premiums , which accounted for about $7.5-million of the $24.3-million the industry said it spent on all forms of advertising in 1970 . The legislation apparently would not extend to sponsorship by tobacco companies of car rallies and other sports events . Under the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to carry the following : " Warning : Danger to health increases with amount smoked , " and , " Avoid inhaling . " In introducing the bill , John IC . Munro , the Minister of National Health and Welfare , declared : " It is well established that cigarette smoking is a seriIons health hazard and is one of the major preventable causes of disease with which we can and must deal . " He said , that " most cases of lung cancer are attributable to cigarette smoking " and that " cigarette smoking Is a major contributor to death and disability from heart attacks and chronic respiratory disease , " Paul Pare , chairman of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council , answered , as the industry has for many years , that science has failed to identify any agent in tobacco or cigarette smoke as causing any particular disease . Mr. Pare said the " indictment " of smoking as hazardous to health " is based essentially on statistics and accepted as fact by virtue of many years of repetition . " Passage of the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Commons and in the absence so far of significant opposition . The office of Robert L. Stanfield , the Conservative party leader , said that so far neither he nor the party had a position . Mr. Munro said $13-million to $14-million of advertising by the industry would be eliminated by the new law . Aides said the figure was taken from a marketing magazine . The industry 's figure of $24.3-million was broken down as follows : Television , $3.3-million ; radio , $3.5-million ; newspapers , $4.1-million ; periodicals , $890,000 ; weekend magazine supplements to newspapers , $2.5-million ; billboard and transit cars , $2.5-million , and promotions , $7.5-million . The bill provides maximum penalties for corporations and corporate officers , directors or agents , of fines up to $100,000 and up to five years in jail . Mr. Munro said that after discus-. sions with industry executives he believed the companies would respect the law . Mr. Pare said that " what gives us greatest concern " was the power to set maximum tar and nicotine levels .

In that event , he said , one result might be to encourage the smuggling into Canada of cigarettes from the United States . Mr. Munro , who once announced that he had quit smoking cigarettes , conceded today that he still smoked but had cut down from nearly three ( packages a day to one and a half . Mr. Munro said he believed that the absence of advertising would lead to less cigarette smoking but that " we do n't think the public is going to stop smoking overnight . " Be cause smoking was so widespread , he said , it was not feasible for the Government to prohibit it altogether . Mr. Pare said experience in other countries showed that advertising restrictions " have little or no effect on reducing smoking . " Government action against cigarette advertising had been anticipated for more than a year , following the publication of a House of Commons committee report recommending a gradual phasing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively . Mr. Munro said that criticism of the Government for not having acted sooner was justified . The reason for the delay , he said , was " the amount of time it takes " to prepare uch legislation .
