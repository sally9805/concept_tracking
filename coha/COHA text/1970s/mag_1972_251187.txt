It was just after midnight on May 22 , 1970 , when St. Paul police headquarters got an anonymous call asking help for a woman about to give birth . Two policemen sped to the scene but found only a darkened house . While one policeman went round to a back door , a sniper suddenly opened fire from across the street . The second policeman fell mortally wounded . <P> It seemed a random attack on " police in general , " and the only clue was the telephone call , which had been routinely taped . To find a matching voice , police interrogated 13 women in the neighborhood . At each interview they made " voiceprints " - electronic " pictures " of the individual 's voice . Because her voiceprint matched the taped call , Caroline Trimble , 18 , was arrested and later indicted for first-degree murder . <P> Conceived in 1941 as a way for the deaf to " read " speech , the voice-print machine analyzes patterns of frequency and amplitude , transcribing each variation into a spectrogram . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voiceprint is as unique as his fingerprints , and that any skilled technician can identify a voiceprint with more than 99% accuracy . Other scientists have disputed his claims . <P> Two earlier cases involving voiceprints came before courts in New Jersey ( 1967 ) and California ( 1968 ) , and both times the appeals courts rejected the device as unreliable . Among the experts who opposed voiceprints at the time was Oscar Tosi , a professor of audiology at Michigan State ; since then , however , Tosi has compared some 34,000 voiceprints under a $300,000 grant from the Justice Department , and the evidence has convinced him . In the case of Caroline Trimble , he testified in favor of voiceprint evidence , and Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Oscar Knutson agreed with him . <P> Knutson observed that courts permit witnesses to identify voices on the basis of what they heard with their own ears , even via telephone . " We are convinced , " the court ruled , " that spectrograms ought to be admissible at least for the purpose of corroborating opinions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
