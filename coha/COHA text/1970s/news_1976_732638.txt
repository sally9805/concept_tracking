txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor A Warning Against Divestiture To the Editor .. . I refer to Senator Gary Hart 's recent letter taking- The Times to task for opposing oil industry divestiture . The potential tragedy , evident from Senator Hart 's letter , is that divestiture may be accomplished by - legislators who know little about the oil industry , and understand even less the ultimate effects of their actions . Divestiture will ' change the lives of millions of workers , investors , and consumers , burden the public with more , not less , government control , raise towering inefficiencies and create shortages . Senator Hart , and others , hint at a network of interlocking arrangements which , combined with vertical integration , give the companies control over crude oil and great power over pur. economy . Even though no one company accounts for more than 11 percent of oil and gas production , the Senate bill would affect companies'accounting for as little as 1.4 percent . Meanwhile , 10,000 firms explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the petroleum business . In recent years the gasoline market share of U.S. independent companies has gone from 18 percent in 1965 to 30 percent by 1975 at the expense of the " majors , " whose profits have fallen below the average of other manufacturing industries . Thus , history shows neither lack of competition nor undue influence on the economy . Tiffany Says It Can To the Editor : In your July 27 edition you quote the director of the Metropolitan Museum as follows : " The difference between us and Tiffany 's is that we can reproduce silver bowls from the Louvre  --  they ca n't . " That is true as far as it goes , but it only , goes as far as the Louvre , today . Tiffany can and has in the past reproduced antique silver designs from museums and private collections . However , we feel our real role is in creating original designs today . Designs that in 100 years time will be in the Louvre for the Metropolitan to reproduce . That is the really important difference between Tiffany silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co . New York , July 29 , 1976 ? The Questionable Symbol To the Editor : Recently , on a Manhattan bus , I saw a placard with - the ubiquitous symbol of the Big Apple . In bold letters was an inscription which read : " New Yorkers have to be a little crazy to live here , but they wo n't die of boredom . Enjoy . " As a New Yorker , I strongly resent this type of advertisement . It does nothing to help our crime-ridden and fiscally troubled city . To whom , pray , is the message on the placard addressed ? Perhaps one ' will not die of boredom  --  very . few ever do . But what about stab or gunshot wounds ? The Big Apple , in my opinion , is a questionable symbol , advertising quesTo the Editor : Regarding your July 23 editorial and future editorials , counties should not be overlooked in discussing the effects of national legislation . Counties are the governing bodies of 93 percent of the nation 's population . Just as the recently passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue delivery of essential services , it will also reach nearly 600 unemployment ridden counties around the country . Counties have actively been seeking this dual program of public works and jobs for over a year . As the executive director of the National Association of Counties , Bernard F. Hillenbrand , pointed out , it makes sense simultaneously to bolster these recessionhit counties through private employment in public works and public employment based on need . Unemployment has had two important effects on county finances : ? A survey of 15 major urban counties showed off a gereral fall-off in tax revenues as a result of the bleak unemployment picture . Most counties have had to take action to at least hold the line on spending . Many have faced deep cutbacks . ? High unemployment not only decreases county revenues , it also increases outlays in meeting health and welfare needs . Counties administer Competition in domestic crude oil pricing is highly desirable , surely . But it is hardly obtainable so long as our domestic prices are controlled far below world levels and this country , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of foreign crude oil to meet its demands . Under these conditions domestic crude producers , integrated or independent , can not be expected to sell their crude at prices lower than the maximums permitted by U.S. law . Vertical divestiture will not phange this situation . But what divestiture would do is weaken our international petroleum companies in competition with such foreign firms as Royal Dutch/Shell , British Petroleum , Petrofina and others whose structures will remain free from government tampering . This would injure U.S. international trade and further cost our country in jobs and profits from overseas . As Senator Hart points out , after divestiture the crude production unit of Exxon would indeed be a large company . But oil units are interdependent . ALL of them do not always make money . Also , size alone does not mean success : the Pennsylvania Railroad was a large company . So was the New York Central . So was W. T. Grant . The Edsel Division of Ford had 15,800 employees , 1,200 dealers , and $400 , - 000,000 . ' J. D. TIERNEY New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an international petroleum company . tionable virtues , and replete with pitfalls . Let 's dispense with it , for at best it brings cynical guffaws from most New Yorkers . Instead , let 's get'on with the hard job of salvaging our city by diligent effort and our good works . This will bear better fruit . MARTIN ISAACS New York , Aug. 4 , 1976 ? A Ford-Rockefeller Vote To the Editor : President Ford is a man of great , good judgment and solid conviction . He will prevail over Governor Reagan quite on his own brave and courageous record . And he will defeat Governor Carter  --  again on his fine record . Nelson Rockefeller has served our country well as Vice President . And it 's almost unbelievable when one considers some of those individuals being urged on . President Ford as a replacement for Nelson Rockefeller . I 'm hopeful I 'll have the opportunity to support a Ford-Rockefeller ticket . It 's a winner . WILLIAM O'SHAUGHNESSY New Rochelle , Aug. 5 , 1976 ? Tragedy or Triumph ? To the Editor : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What boggles my mind even more , however , is the incalculable good the funds used for this project could have done here on this planet . I think the Mars venture at this time actually represents more tragedy than triumph for us and all future earthlings-to-be . I hope and pray that I am wrong . JAMES H. VAN RAALTE Sands Point , L.I. , Aug. 6 , 1976 welfare programs to half the nation 's welfare recipients . Only four major U.S. cities , New York , Baltimore , Denver and San Francisco , administer welfare programs  --  the rest of them are administered by states or counties . Los Angeles County which is the largest county in the United States , for example , directed 47 percent of its total budget of $3 billion to social service programs ( welfare and health ) . Under the Public Works Bill- antirecession grants , Los Angeles County with a current unemployment rate of 10 percent would receive about $22 million . Wayne County , Michigan , with 12.7 percent unemployment would receive $4.5 million , while Baltimore County with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is to say that counties count . There are 37 counties with populations over a million and budgets from $300 to . $400 million . Most people in the nation do not live in big cities . Only 15 percent of the nation 's population resides in cities of over 500,000 . Twenty percent lives in cities of over 250,000 . For the first time in 1970 , the census classified more people living outside of the central cities than inside . BETH DENNISTON Public Affairs Director , Natignal Association of Counties Washington , July 28 , 1976 Foreign- Arms Sales To the Editor : Times reporter Leslie Gelb ( Aug. 24 states that United States experts believe Iran is now so dependent on American personnel that it could not go to war without U.S. support .. . and by 1980 at least 50,000 Americans could be tied up in training Iran to use American , ultra-sophisticated military systems . Our State Department falls back on that overworked alibi of " area defense " ' ? that the contractors are " private . " . But obviously the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iran fears threats from the Soviets tied up with India , Afghanistan and ? ? Iraq and also worries about Soviet support for the separatist movement . among certain tribes in Iraq . The area is a trouble spot . Now Secretary Kissinger is said to be discussing a barter of Iranian oil for more American arms . Iran has just completed plans to purchase $10 billion worth of arms from the U.S. The situation is akin to our pouring into Jordan and Saudi Arabia vast quantities of highly sophisticated , weaponry ( mainly missiles ) workable by aid of American technicians un- . doubtedly for an avowed war against . , Israel . Former Secretary Schlesinger once tried to curb arms merchants . Senator Humphrey warned that billions in arms sales to Iran , have been out of control . Will the lust for petrodollars eventually drive us into another Vietnam tragedy  --  into the curse of unbridled greed ? Editorial Aug. 11.1 WILLARD STUART GOURSE New York , Aug. 7 , 1976 ? For Cheaper Power To the Editor : Your sympathetic July 29 editorial , . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Con Ed customers despairs too much about alternative solutions . Westchester County Executive Alfred DelBello , County Legislator Ronald Tocci and I are on solid ground in demanding that the State Power Authority ( P.A.S.N.Y. ) provide a fair share of cheap hydroelectric power to downstate residents . The long-standing inequity should be corrected . Six years ago I strongly urged Con Ed to go to -- court if necessary to assure that its customers would receive their fair share of this power . Con Ed refused to do so . Indeed , Con Ed Chairman Charles Luce said in a recent press release that his reason for not ? suing for P.A.S.N.Y. power was a desire not to aggravate upstate-downstate relationships . The fact is , however , that the up- ' state area is being .. unjustly enriched ? while downstate ratepayers are being ' unjustly devastated . There is no reason for a New York State authority to ' discriminate any longer ; P.A.S.N.Y. should provide cheap power to downstate " people as consumers " as the law requires . Lastly , I have serious questions about P.A.S.N.Y. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored customers at different rates . I will be pursuing this matter through the Federal Power Commis- ? sion and my Congressional committees . In sum , we can and should get our fair share of State Power Authority generated cheap hydro power . We may have to sue to do so  --  and this Westchester County should do if need be , since Con Ed refuses . RICHARD L. OTTINGER Member of Congress , 24th Dist. , N.Y . Washington , July 29 , 1976 ? The Nixon Back Taxes To the Editor : A recent editorial argued that former President Nixon should keep his promise to pay certain back taxes even though the three-year statute of , limitations on the year in issue had expired . While the editorial is correct , to rely on Mr. Nixon 's promise leaves something to be desired . You should be aware that there is no statute of limitations on civil tax fraud . Indeed , if proven , the Government is entitled to a 50 percent ' penalty in addition to the tax deficiency . From facts available to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transaction giving rise to the tax deficiency , the Government might have a good case against Mr. Nixon . Why has not the Internal Revenue Service pursued the matter ? THEODORE S. LYNN New York , Aug. 3 , 1976-
