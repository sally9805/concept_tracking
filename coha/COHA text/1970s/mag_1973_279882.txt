FRANTZ FANON <P> by IRENE L.GENDZIER <P> 300 pages . Pantheon. $10 . <P> Frantz Fanon was born an outsider . He lived on the cusp of history , ground between implacable opposites . A black man from Martinique , Fanon grew up in the intensely French and white-oriented prewar culture of that island . Making it there , he went to France to train as a psychiatrist with whites as his patients . Then , in 1953 , he moved to Algeria to direct a mental hospital crowded with North African Moslems . <P> Torn between Freud and Marx , Fanon flung himself into the opening phase of the Algerian revolution and became one of the FLN 's chief pamphleteers and theorists . He fell sick , journeyed to Moscow for a cure , but was eventually told by Soviet specialists that the only hope for his leukemia lay in Washington , D.C. In the National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda , Md. , weeks before he died in 1961 at age 36 , he received the first copies of his last and most revolutionary book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body flown to Tunis and buried him with honors in Algerian soil , while a CIA agent stood by his grave . <P> Today the Algerians minimize Fanon 's role in their victory . They have all but made him a nonperson in the land he struggled for . Yet his early and passionate assertion that black culture is beautiful , as well as his later preaching that the oppressed can heal their souls through the cathartic effect of revolutionary violence , posthumously turned Fanon into a hero for some white radical theorists and some American blacks . <P> Fanon 's books , though not highly original , gain an undeniable authenticity because they spring so intensely from what he lived and observed . He had read Hegel , who wrote in the most abstract way of the distorting effects of the master-slave relationship on the psychic life of the slave . He had also read and been deeply influenced by Sartre , who ( in Anti-Semite and Jew ) gave Hegel 's master-slave analysis labyrinthine new twists .

It is all too tempting to see more in Irene Gendzier 's attempt than she actually achieves . Gendzier , an associate professor of history at Boston University , set out first , she says , " to write a psychohistory " that would relate the development of Fanon 's " inner forces " to his public life . But she abandoned that aim , in part because the evidence proved hard to get . Fanon 's widow , for example , refused to be interviewed . Gendzier then turned to what she subtitles " a critical study . " It bears its best fruit in the rediscovery of Fanon 's least-known works , the several professional psychiatric papers he wrote directly out of his Algerian hospital experience , before committing himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
