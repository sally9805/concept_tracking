TIME 'S economists see scant price relief , more unemployed <P> It will be longer and deeper than even the pessimists were predicting only a short time ago . <P> That is how TIME 's Board of Economists views the Recession of ' 79 , which it forecast as early as last November and which began in April . The bipartisan board agrees that the worst is yet to come : the recession will last 12 to 15 months rather than six to nine months , as previously forecast . The economy will shrink 3% during the decline rather than just 1% to 2% . Meanwhile , inflation will remain near 10% . Not until next summer will expansion resume , and even then it will be rather weak . Scarce and expensive energy will mean that growth throughout the 1980s will be sluggish . Says Democrat Walter Heller , who was President John Kennedy 's chief economic adviser and now counsels brother Teddy : " The bad news bear is up the path . The recession has only just begun to bite . " <P> Just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy was somewhat stronger in August and September than it was in the early summer . With gasoline readily available again , buyers have returned to shopping centers and auto showrooms . Reflecting this consumer boomlet , the Commerce Department guesstimates that the economy may have actually grown at an annual rate of 1% in the third quarter . But in the fourth quarter , which begins this week , the brief spending splurge is expected to fade , and the pace of business will slow sharply . <P> Republican Alan Greenspan , perhaps the most optimistic member of TIME 's board , sees a roller-coaster recession : the economy , after its slight rise , will plunge steeply during the coming winter and spring . Unemployment , which has hovered at about 5.7% for the past year , inched up to 6.0% in August , and a majority of TIME 'S board predict that it will reach 8% by next summer , meaning some 8 million Americans will be out of work . That is severe , of course , but not as bad as during the 1974-75 recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antidote , several board members favor a tax cut . Heller argues that an early $28 billion reduction for consumers and corporations is " the only way to fly . " Joseph Pechman , head of economic studies at the Brookings Institution , agrees on the need for a prompt cut . <P> The length and depth of this slump will be largely determined by monetary policy . In the eight weeks since Paul Volcker took over as Federal Reserve chairman , businessmen 's basic cost of borrowing money has jumped from 11.75% to 13.5% , the highest in history . Most board members hold that the increases will soon stop but interest rates will remain steep over the next year . Some fear that the Fed may worsen the recession by inducing a classic credit crunch , in which little money is available for borrowing to finance new plants and create jobs . <P> So far even the populist Carter Administration has backed Volcker 's high-interest policy . Yet banks have had plenty of money to lend anyway-perhaps too much . In the past month , the money supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprinkel , executive vice president of Chicago 's Harris Bank , argues that this " hemorrhaging " must be stanched if inflation is ever to be curbed.
