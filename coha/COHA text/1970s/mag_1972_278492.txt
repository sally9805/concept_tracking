CASE LOAD-MAXIMUM <P> by E. RICHARD JOHNSON <P> 204 pages . Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> Abbie Hoffman , who had ample opportunity for observation , has concluded that " everyone in prison is writing something . " Indeed , there is a tradition of prisoner-authors from John Bunyan and O. Henry to Nehru and Genet . Most of the current ones , including Eldridge Cleaver , the Berrigan brothers and Hoffman himself , have used prison time to work out polemical theories . A few , though , are nonpolitical convicts who are trying to write about what they know best-crime . By far the most skillful is E. ( for Emil ) Richard Johnson , inmate No. 22251 at Minnesota 's Stillwater State Prison , now 34 and doing 40 years for second-degree murder . <P> Johnson has published seven novels in the past four years . Silver Street , his first , won an " Edgar " from the Mystery Writers of America as the best first mystery of 1968 . His second , Mongo 's Back in Town , was bought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last November . Like Johnson 's others , Case Load-Maximum amply displays his ability to thread a meticulous plot line through the grit and slime of an urban netherworld where everyone has an angle too sharp for his own good . <P> Pimps and whores , hired killers and psychosadists , news vendors and bar bums , " rape-os " and cops-all move in and out of Johnson 's scene , rendered without apology or moral judgment . Unlike writers who have never been there , Johnson has no need to sensationalize the seamy edge of society . In taut , frosted gray prose that is flat but never dull , his characters are compellingly stamped with their limiting individuality , totally unable to be more or less than they are . Silver Street 's Tony Lonto , for instance , can not help being a good cop any more than he can keep from making a futile effort to steer a young prostitute into a respectable job as a waitress . Case Load 's Detective Mose Hamilton sees only punks in the world he polices , and the sour vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have merely lived in such a world instead of writing about it . A Wisconsin-born son of middle-class parents , he intended to make the Army his career . But while serving as a staff sergeant in Kansas , he was thrown into the stockade and eventually given an " undesirable " discharge for stealing a steer-an offense that he admitted but claimed was a lark . <P> Odd jobs followed as a logger , well rigger , powder monkey and ranch hand . In between , he got deeper into crime . He was convicted in Nebraska on a robbery charge , and while serving that sentence , was brought to trial for a Minnesota gas-station holdup in which he was accused of shooting the attendant . " Coming in for 40 years . " he told TIME Correspondent Joe Boyce recently , " I felt , well , if I was going to do anything with my life , I 'd have to do it here . I always enjoyed reading , so I turned to writing . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
