Next instruction . " // " Mileage reading 63.15 . Left at T. CAST 54.5. " // " How 's my time ? " // " You 're still almost a minute late . " // " I 'll make it up after the T. " // The Porsche , a yellow 1973 911T named Bismark III , downshifts from 80 mph to negotiate the linked turns . It comes through the pale corn stalks that cover the Illinois countryside , its rear end twitching on the gravel-strewn road . The driver is Orville J. Meyer  --  called O.J. by some and Jerry by others . He is a short , powerful man with a mop of blond hair . He saws at the padded steering wheel with deft choppy motions that straighten the car in time for a fast approaching T intersection . He blips the throttle twice , double-clutches into second and yanks the wheel to the left , power-sliding through the corner . In the bucket seat beside him , Helga , his pretty wife , never raises her head from the collection of typewritten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide rule in her hands . The Porsche accelerates to 85 on the level farm roadway and the litany continues : // " Next instruction . " // " Mileage reading 66.40 . Right at Y. " // " Can you get me on time ? " // " I 'll try . We have another CAST Change Average Speed To coming up . " // It is Sunday afternoon and Jerry Meyer , a chemical engineer for Du Pont , a metal sculptor , skier , sailor , backpacker , golfer and Porsche fanatic  --  he is president-elect of the Porsche Club of America 's 230-member Chicago Region  --  is deep in one of his favorite hobbies . In this TSD ( time , speed , distance ) rally a driver and a navigator must follow a series of instructions over a given distance , proceeding at given average speeds that constantly change and , using that familiar eighth-grade math formula D=RT , compute elapsed time . The rally is divided into legs that terminate at manned checkpoints . Waiting officials , who know the predetermined arrival time of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car is early or late . The team with a score closest to perfect wins , and any rallyist receiving a citation from the law is automatically disqualified . At the moment Jerry Meyer is behind his correct time because , for a brief period earlier in the rally , he got lost . // " Helga , you have to get me on time , " Jerry says . " I 'm trying , Jerry , " his wife replies , " but these speed changes keep fouling me up . " " Here , " Jerry shouts , " let me do it . " And as the Porsche barrels down the highway he begins making calculations with the slide rule while steering with his knees . " You have to go right at that Y , Jerry , " Helga says . But all he can do is mumble since he 's got the slide rule between his teeth as he saws away at the steering wheel once again . The turn negotiated , he spits out the slide rule and resumes calculations , all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running account of rallying , the internal workings of his car , the state of the economy and how , for an upcoming crafts fair , he intends to use old exhaust valves and pieces of timing chain in his sculptures . // Give Meyer a trumpet and he will accompany himself at the same time , although it has been a while since he led his own dance band . And do not worry about a breakdown sidelining the Porsche ; Meyer could fix a blown transmission with a can opener . In the past year , between ski trips , a canoeing expedition , backpacking in Colorado and a week of scuba diving and fishing in Florida off an oceangoing sloop he and Helga chartered with some friends , Meyer rebuilt four or five Porsche engines , a number of VW 's and his furnace . He installed a sauna in his cellar , ran a couple of drivers ' schools for the SCCA and about once a month indulged himself in a rally . // You can look it up . It is all there in the calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activities they somehow manage to attend . The calendar is in the bookcase , next to the sculptured lamp that Meyer made and the passport photos he took himself , in color . ( " Nothing says you ca n't take your own passport pictures and nothing says they ca n't be in color , " Meyer claims . ) It is n't that he ca n't afford to have things done for him , it is just that things seem to come out better if he does them himself . // Meyer , 34 , is a senior supervisor of production at Du Pont 's East Chicago ( Ind. ) plant . " I got my personality , at least the I-can-do-it-myself part , from my mother , " he says . " When I was just a little kid I remember her telling my father a couple of times how she wanted a larger kitchen . One day my dad took me fishing , and when we got home there was an enormous pile of plaster in the front yard . My mother had torn down one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure hope that is n't a load-bearing wall , ' my father said . My mother just stood there and smiled . And that 's how she got her bigger kitchen . " // Meyer , a native of Cincinnati , told the story a couple of evenings before the rally while sitting in his den , a warm , lived-in room full of wind chimes , mobiles , rocks from Colorado and his sculptures . Helga 's framed needlepoint renditions of Porsches at speed hung on two of the walls , and in front of the bookcase sat the " stuff-box . " A stuff-box holds paraphernalia related to an upcoming weekend 's activities . It now contained two Meylan 400 stopwatches and a set of rally tables designed by Meyer . // The Meyers live in Munster , Ind. , a quiet suburb of Chicago , where on Friday nights before high school football games the trees in front of varsity players ' homes are draped by the cheerleaders with reams of bathroom tissue  --  getting T.P. 'd , they call it . At the edge of his lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the grass , another example of his creativity that thrives on recycling discarded material . It also has produced such sculpture as workmen swinging picks , shovels made from old spark plugs and valve guides and a living-room lamp built from the remains of a fire escape . // It comes as no surprise that Meyer places his personal stamp on all his cars . Engineers buy Porsches because Porsches are reputed to be the most precisely designed cars in the world ; overdesigned , many car enthusiasts insist . Doctors and lawyers buy Porsches because engineers tell them the car is the most highly refined performance vehicle available . But Jerry Meyer , engineer , lifelong car nut and avowed champion of the marque , took his brand-new $10,500 Porsche Targa , which had been specially assembled for him at the factory , and proceeded to alter the entire suspension system because he was n't satisfied with the car 's handling characteristics . He did the job in his garage  --  cutting , fitting and repositioning vital parts on an automobile whose owners have apoplexy when it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as simple as ripping down a kitchen wall , even though , like serious rallyists in general and Porsche owners in particular , Meyer treats his car with surgical fastidiousness . To move it from the garage to the driveway for a washing , for example , he rolls rather than drives the 911 , believing that to run the engine for only a few seconds would cause a buildup of condensation , resulting in a rusted-out exhaust system . // Now Meyer guns the Porsche up to nearly 100 mph . " It seems as though the different legs of this rally were laid out by different cars with different odometers , " he says , " because our O.D. factor keeps changing and I 'll be damned if we can get on time . " An O.D. factor is the difference between a rally car 's odometer over a given distance and that of the car laying out the rally . At the rally 's start , all cars run an introductory " odometer leg , " during which they measure this difference and figure it into subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult . If , for example , you must travel at 50 mph for five miles , then at 30 mph for eight miles and finally at 40 mph for seven miles , it is not too hard to compute your correct elapsed time for the entire 20 miles . But try this : 5.4 miles at 37 mph , then 3.2 miles at 48.5 mph , followed by 6.6 miles at 51.5 mph . Got it down ? Now throw in a garbage truck that cuts you off at an intersection and which you must follow at 15 mph for half a mile , a stop sign where you encounter a 12-car wedding party causing a delay of 45 seconds and an ambiguous direction for a right turn where there are two possible roads to take , resulting in a 30-second delay while you argue with your companion . // If you are cool , and running in the equipped class with a $1,000 computer under the dashboard flashing readouts based on corrections fed in by your navigator , or a Curta calculator , a device resembling a pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many minutes per mile ) and receive an accurate time , then you 've got nothing to worry about except getting lost . However , if you are running in the unequipped class , like Jerry Meyer  --  who would sooner bring his Porsche to the corner gas station for a tune-up than run a rally equipped  --  you are in trouble . All you have in the front seat are a stopwatch , a slide rule and homemade rally tables giving the number of minutes required to go a certain distance . There also is your navigator 's mathematical expertise to rely on . By the middle of a rally it may be questionable , owing to the fact that navigators are too busy during a rally to look up ; after several dozen high-speed corners they tend to become queasy . // Such troubles do not fit into the Meyer system of rally . His system allows Helga , boggled as she is by the three factors warring in her head  --  the changing mileage , the alternations of average speed and the time they have n't as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss . It allows Meyer at least a measure of satisfaction in being late , because being late means he can work out the 911 to make up time . And even if they do n't win this rally , they will enjoy an afternoon of highly technical perambulation and can look forward to dinner with their Porsche Club friends , which for Meyer is the purpose of it all . // For many competitors , this is not the case . At the Mercedes garage in Barrington , Ill. where the rally started , there had been considerable psyching as Porsche owners eyed each other warily over steaming cups of coffee . Some feigned ignorance , others feigned hangovers , as they prepared to do battle in spit-shined machines worth as much as $25,000 . Nor was Meyer always this calm ; he admits that he once would have done anything to win . // " I 'm a competitive person in a competitive society and although I do n't like it , I 've come to accept it , " he says . " I compete on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing , I want to do it well , but now I try to achieve some sort of balance . When Helga and I began rallying in 1966 , we were competitive as hell . I 'd found a hobby that demanded skills for which I 'd been trained , which I liked . And at the same time it allowed me to pursue my interest in cars without the expense or the time involvement of racing . We worked our way up from beginners to experts and won the Chicago Region Porsche Club Rally Championship in 1969 . But rally stopped being fun because we were just in it to win . We started fighting and worrying all the time about who would show up at a rally to challenge us . Finally I said , ' This is n't enjoyable anymore , and if a hobby is n't enjoyable , then it 's time to get another hobby . ' So we backed off and now , even though we try to do well , we 're only in it for fun . If I got involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus I would have to give up other things like sailing or skiing or backpacking , and I do n't want to do that . But I 'll keep on rallying on the club level , maybe run an event a month , and throw in a gymkhana here and there because I really enjoy driving the Porsche hard and because I 'll always be into cars . " // A quick trip to Meyer 's garage , outfitted like a miniature NASCAR shop , eliminates any doubts about his devotion to the automobile . Next to Bismark III sits Bismark II , a 1967 Porsche 912 . Bismark I , another 912 , was demolished by a trailer truck a couple of years back . The crash won Meyer a lifetime membership in the National Safety Council 's Kangaroo Club for people whose lives have been saved by seat belts . In the driveway rest Ziegfried , a Volkswagen beetle ; Bruenhilda , a Kharmann-Ghia ; and The Art-full Dodger , a fully carpeted , paneled and stereo-ed 1974 Dodge van used primarily for ski trips and camping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal combustion engines . // The Du Pont plant in East Chicago where Meyer works looms above the colorless landscape with no pretense to architectural beauty . A network of railroad tracks bedded in black dirt angles among the somber buildings , and an acrid blend of chemical smells hovers in the air . It is the kind of place that the typically ambitious young engineer would view as a stepping-stone to a future amid plush corporate surroundings . Not Jerry Meyer . He believes in roots and enjoys his work , finding it a challenge to his creative and organizational skills . " I 've seen a lot of men come through here who are just putting in their time ... paying their dues before they move on to another plant , " he says . " They are n't interested in doing a job . They see their entire lives with that kind of vision and never really devote themselves to anything . And you know something , they never really enjoy themselves either . " // By registering early , Meyer had been able to select his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead car . " If you 're car No. 1 , you 're never tempted to follow anyone else , " he says . Even though he and Helga were late they still arrived at each checkpoint ahead of any other team , but Meyer declined to protest the fluctuating O.D. factor . In the old days he would have been hopping up and down outside the Porsche like a runaway jack-hammer . " I 've seen rallies where four out of five legs get thrown out by the protests , " Meyer says . " Picayune stuff like that kills the sport , and you have no idea how detailed rallyists can be . In an SCCA national rally you 'll be told the size of the tire on the car laying out the course and whether it was cold or warm , because a tire 's circumference changes with its temperature . You know what information like that is good for ? To drive you nuts , that 's what . " // There is something in the nature of TSD adherents that dotes on minutiae and technical nuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird variations . Meyer remembers one rally he ran that included the following instruction : Every time you see the word creek spelled out , increase the average speed 10% , but every time creek is abbreviated , decrease average speed 10% . " You 're going along at 50 mph and you see creek spelled out , so you increase to 55 , " he says . " Then you see cr. and nine out of 10 people decreased to 50 rather than 49.5 . " When he was asked how one managed to drive at 49.5 miles an hour , Meyer just chuckled . // The set of directions in this particular Porsche Club rally were graphic illustrations called " tulip instructions , " which the navigator had to translate into English for the driver . For example , a symbol like the one shown here means to make the first right after the railroad tracks . Serious TSD rallyists do n't like tulip instructions and would rather contend with more meaningful directives like the " main road rule , " meaning on a highway with a bend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or the " as-straight-as-possible rule , " whereby given the same alternatives , you follow the fork . Pro rallyists , who bludgeon high-performance vehicles over animal trails , logging roads and dried-out riverbeds in events like the Safari in East Africa and the Press On Regardless in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , think TSD rallyists are in the same league as card-catalog librarians and would rather demolish their cars without the benefit of any directions at all . But both share a curious relationship to the terrain over which they travel ; they regard the world outside their cars as an obstacle to be overcome , never as a system to which they belong . // At a quiet crossroads on the rally route , several children kick a soccer ball in a lot full of leaves . An old man wearing a Stetson hat , an " open road " model , walks his horse inside a rickety corral beside a weathered frame farmhouse where , in the front yard , an Edsel is for sale . A girl , perhaps 11 , swings on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rusty chain . The scene is frozen for an instant , then disappears with a frantic whine of gears into a valley flanked by plowed fields as , one by one , in Porsches of every vintage and color , the rallyists pass . Oblivious of their surroundings , aware of nothing but the translation of words into course changes and alternations of speed , they impose an overlay of calculations on the countryside and thus remove it from sight . They could be anywhere on earth as long as a left turn appears in 4.7 miles . They are engaged in a ritual of precision , in harmony with nature only when they are not lost and are on time . They have no desire to distill , from the landscape that races by , images of a country Sunday afternoon . // A few get lost . One destroys his transmission and scatters clutch parts over half an acre of potatoes . Several navigators become ill , but eventually they all rendezvous at a restaurant , a replica of a Bavarian beer garden complete with statued lawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club dinner , an event that concludes each of the club 's rallies . The official scorer is nowhere to be found so , true to form , Jerry Meyer sits down and goes to work . " If I do n't do it , the guy will show up and have to read score sheets instead of having dinner , " he says , without rancor , happy to be among friends , sipping vodka gimlets and discussing the pitfalls of the rally course . He and Helga have finished fifth overall , but he does n't care . During the meal he shuttles among a couple that shares another of his new interests , CB radios , a woman who , like him , will exhibit at next week 's crafts show and a man who wants some help with an engine rebuild . Plans must be made . Since Thursday night he has attended a concert of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , organized and overseen a party for Du Pont employees and run this rally , but he shows no signs of slowing down . // At 1:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep dreaming of checkpoints and mileage readings , Jerry Meyer stands in front of the workbench in his garage , welding goggles pushed up on his grimy forehead , an acetylene torch in his hand , examining the metal figures he has just brazed . They are hockey players made from discarded railroad spikes and pieces of brass ; Meyer plans to include them in his exhibit at the crafts fair . On the floor , a surrealistic plant with stems of copper tubing , leaves of hammered brass and a base fashioned from chunks of some rocklike substance Meyer retrieved from a blast furnace at the Du Pont plant sits beside a Porsche engine that needs rebuilding . Helga pokes her head in from the den and says she is going to sleep . Meyer flips a switch , shutting off the stereo speakers in the house but allowing the sound system he has wired into the garage to continue playing . And as Janis Joplin begins to sing the blues he fires up the torch and goes back to work . After all , it 's Monday already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still eight hours before he has to be at work .
