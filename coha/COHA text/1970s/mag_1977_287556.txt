A week ago , the sad ending of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance 's mission to Moscow seemed to herald a critical break in Soviet-American relations-an end to SALT , perhaps , if not an end to detente . The Soviets had rebuffed as unacceptable new strategic arms proposals offered by the Carter Administration . In addition , there was a continuing volley of and-American rhetoric in the Soviet press and the angry diatribe by Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko ( TIME , April 11 ) . <P> By last week there was growing evidence that all the early alarms had been much too strident . To begin with , the Soviets indicated that they might have overreacted to the Administration 's position . The decidedly mellowing tone was set during a Kremlin dinner for visiting Cuban Premier Fidel Castro , at which Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev suggested that the Moscow chill had not been intended as a deepfreeze . He referred to the U.S. as " our partners " and scolded the Americans for " losing their constructive approach " and for adhering to a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in arms limitation , he declared , if the U.S. would only seek " mutually acceptable solutions , not in words but by deeds . " <P> Tn Washington , meanwhile , Vance stressed the Administration 's conviction that negotiations over SALT II have only just begun ( see interview ) . He said both sides would be working quietly toward the next meeting in Geneva in late May . President Carter too insisted that SALT II is still on target and predicted that the chances of reaching a new arms agreement before the expiration of SALT I in October are " much better than fifty-fifty . " <P> There were more specific indications that both sides had read the danger signals correctly and decided to shift their diplomacy into a lower key . At midweek Vance received Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin at the State Department for an unannounced and fruitful meeting . Later , Carter disclosed that he had received personal assurances from Brezhnev that the Soviet Union was as serious as the U.S. in its pursuit of a new agreement . Then , in a statement that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that if the Soviets gave him evidence that the U.S. proposals presented at Moscow were inequitable , he would consider changing them when the talks begin next month in Geneva . With dizzying speed , the diplomatic chill turned into a spring thaw . The Moscow " failure " might yet prove to have been a successful first step . <P> Meanwhile , foreign policy experts continued to analyze the three general criticisms of the Administration 's approach to the Moscow meeting : 1 ) 1 ) THAT WASHINGTON HAD ALARMED THE NOTORIOUSLY SECRETIVE SOVIETS BY PUBLICIZING THE DETAILS OF ITS NEW PROPOSALS BEFOREHAND . <P>
