 | Breaking the 65 Barrier @# LAST SEPTEMBER , by a resounding vote of 359 to 4 , the House of J Representatives approved a 1 I1 that heralds a dramatic change in the career options open to millions of Americans . This legislation , which may have been enacted by Congress by the time this article appears , will raise the age limit at which employes can be forced to retire horn 65 to 70 . Compulsory retirement , generally at age 65 , has been around so long that most people regard it as an Immutable fact of life . Over 3o million employes are currently covered by mandatory-retirement policies . e . Giving them freedom of choice is the lung-sought goal of reformers who have argued eloquently against the I justice of ending an individual 's career at an arbitrary age , regardless ( if personal capacity , need or desire t o work . Hearing From the Old . The notion of abolishing mandatory retirement has been around for some time . Associations of the elderly have long expressed discontent with the " 65-and-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending the practice , as did then-candidate Jimmy Carter . A flock of reform bills were dumped into the legislative hopper during the last two Congresses , but there was no action apart from several days of hearings . Then , last January , 77-year-old Claude D. Pepper ( D. , Fla. ) assumed the chairmanship of the House Select Committee on Aging , and quickly turned the full staff resources of his committee onto the issue of mandatory retirement , holding some widely publicized hearings . There was no subtlety to Pepper 's message : " Mandatory retirement arbitrarily severs productive persons 141  | from their livelihood , squanders their talent , scars their health , strains an already overburdened Social Security system and drives many elderly persons into poverty and despair . " Bills introduced by Pepper and Rep. Paul Findley , an Illinois Republican , promptly rolled up a total of 167 cosponsors in the House . Such widespread support for ending compulsory retirement is , in part , a reflection of the times . In recent years , soaring inflation has made retirement for many people a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though Social Security payments have also gone up . At the same time , measures to aid the elderly have gained much wider political appeal . One corporate personnel director tells of confronting a Congressman with the proposition that raising the retirement age would limit job opportunities for the young . " Perhaps , " replied the Congressman . " But the young are not organized in my district ? and I hear from old people all the time . " The avowed goal of Pepper , Findley and other reformers is ultimately to illegalize mandatory retirement at any age . To get the widest support from their colleagues , however , as a first step they backed the proposal that emerged from the House Education and Labor Committee to raise the allowable retirement age from 65 to 70 . Technically , the change would be accomplished by amending the present Age Discrimination in Employment Act . Passed in 1967 and administered by 142 the Labor Department , ADEA n makes illegal any discrimination hiring , firing and promotion tween the ages of 40 and 65 ? there permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coverage would be extended age 70 . An " Acceptable Age . " Ironical 65 became the " normal " retirem age in large part through histori accident . In 1889 , when Germ adopted Chancellor Bismarck 's pi neering old-age pension plan , 65 arbitrarily selected as the pensio able age . Nearly 20 years later , Britain 's first national pension sche set the eligible age at 70 , then lat dropped it to 65 . In Sweden , it w fixed at 67 , then lowered to 65 in Ju 1976 . The designers of the US . Soci Security Act of 1935 picked 65 not on the basis of " scientific , social or ge ontological " facts , as Prof. Wilbur Cohen , who assisted at the birth of the Act , has put it , but because of " general consensus that 65 was th most acceptable age . " Even so , the provision of Social Security benefits , first payable in 1940 , was not linked to any compulsion to retire at 65 . The number of private pensions schemes increased considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wage increases but more flexibility in fringe benefits . The , major upsurge occurred in the 1950$ , following a Supreme Court decision that made pensions a subject on which unions could compel collective bargaining . In the profusion of  | pension plans which followed , compulsory-retirement ages tended to be set ? generally at 65 , because of the availability of Social Security pensions , but not invariably . ( At General Motors , for example , the age is 65 for salaried employes , but 68 for orkers paid on an hourly basis . ) The Case Against . Opponents of mandatory retirement make much of to fact that any number of illustritts individuals remained energetic and productive well beyond the age f 65 . Winston Churchill became ' rime Minister for the first time t 66 , served for five years , and ' turned to power when he was 77 . A t 66 , Harland Sanders launched his fabulously successful Kentucky Fried Chicken chain , and at 87 is still active in promoting the business . After 49 years as chief executive of ( ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he remains as chairman . And so on . Medical authority confirms everyday impressions that there is no direct correlation between chronological age and physical and mental age . " Chronological age provides only a crude estimation and not a very accurate one , " says Dr. Robert N. Butler , director of the National Institute on Aging . For retired long-term employes , a ombination of corporate pension payments and Social Security often provides a decent income ? generally go to 50 percent of pre-retirement earnings . For employes with shorter tenure , however , the company pension is often exceedingly modest . Opponents of mandatory retirement have a solid argument in the hard ships that result for many people who are forced out of their jobs . The American Association of Retired Persons ( with almost r i million members ) has collected a stack of poignant case histories . One healthy and vital woman , for example , had worked for 15 years for the Singer Company when she was forced to retire on January 1 , 1977 , two months after her 65th birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and could see no way of getting along on Woo a year from Social Security , plus a mere $900 by way of a company pension . " This discrimination is terrible for people like myself , " she wrote , " who are able , willing and need to work . " Retirement , whether forced or not , can be painful on other than financial grounds . A recent report by the Conference Board , a prestigious business research organization , ticked off the multiple potential complications : " unwanted idleness , lack of purpose , loss of prestige or individual identity , housing difficulties , legal complications , loneliness , excessive drinking , marital rifts , failing health , fear of death . " Adds the American Medical Association : " Considerable medical evidence is available to indicate that the sudden cessation of productive work and earning power of an individual , caused by compulsory retirement at age 65 , often leads to physical an  | emotional deterioration and premature death . " The Case For . None of the basic assertions about the arbitrariness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships imposed by the 65-and-out rule are disputed by defenders of mandatory retirement . They resist change on other grounds , not the least of which is the fact that the present system has been in place for nearly four decades and , they argue , should not be altered in the hasty fashion on which Congress has been bent . Beyond that , the substantive arguments are of varying merit . Testifying before the Senate last summer on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , Arthur C. Prine , Jr. , vice president of R. R. Donnelley &; Sons , argued that compulsory-retirement schemes " assist in long-range planning for both future labor needs and future retirement costs . " Doubtless such administrative convenience is considerable , but with the variety of early-retirement options already available ? some providing pensions after 30 years ' service , whatever the retiree 's age ? management already must exercise a certain flexibility in its planning . Supporters of the present system also make much of the harsh impact late retirement will have on the unemployment situation ? and particularly on job opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Representative Findley puts it , is simply that " those who attempt to solve an employment problem for the young by puttin older persons out of work mere ) trade one form of unemployment fo another . " It is instructive , moreover , to g , beyond the rhetoric to look at th . figures . Economist Marc Rosen blum , until recently a consultant fo the Senate Special Committee o Aging , estimates that an addition . 200,000 persons will remain in th labor force after the 65 limit is lifted , The Labor Department estimates , 150,000 to 200,000 . Would they have a disastrous effect ? Hardly ; in fact , 200,000 oldsters would represent just one fifth of one percent of the 97.9 million people in the labor force as of last September . Indeed , there is reason to believe that many people will not stay on beyond the age of 65 once given the option . In recent years , there has been a sizable trend toward early retirement despite inflation ? in part because Social Security benefits have kept going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At General Motors , where age 68 is the ceiling for blue-collar workers , only ten percent stay on beyond 65 , and only two percent remain to 68 . In Seattle , where compulsory retirement for municipal employes ( except police and firemen ) was ended last May , early indications are that most of those who become eligible to retire at 65 still do so ? even though they are now welcome to stay on . A more serious problem than the number of people added to the labor  | force . will be how to get rid of the employe who refuses to retire despite faltering job performance . Although the present age-discrimintion act contains a provision allowing employers to fire elderly workers who can no longer perform adequately , the problem is that the employe is not always willing11 to accept his supervisor 's appraisal . In the last fiscal year , there were 35 complaints filed under the age- , Discrimination act , a fivefold increase ice 1969 . Business anticipates an ) surge in new complaints , and wdless litigation , once the mandary-retirement age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly . Personnel officers are also that postponing retirement will keep the top people in an organization wedded to their jobs , thereby blocking advancement for ? and demoralizing ? capable younger workers . It is noteworthy that even Connecticut General , the large insurance comany which recently got a good deal of publicity by abolishing mandatory retirement for most employes , retained the 65-year limit for a thousand corporate officers and fieldoffice managers . " We wanted to avoid concern among younger people that the top jobs would be unavailable , " says Donald D. Illig , director of compensation and benefits . The Senate , concerned about this problem , exempted from its version of the bill individuals who would receive retirement income of $20,000 a year or more from a single employer . Such persons , by no means all top executives , could still be compelled to retire at 65 . The Senate version also permitted compulsory retirement at 65 for tenured college professors . At the House-Senate conference to iron out differences in the two versions , the House delegation objected strenuously to these provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , there will be problems and readjustments galore once the new legislation is in effect . But it will have one abiding virtue : individuals will have far more freedom and flexibility to determine their own career fates . That will be no mean achievement . @#
