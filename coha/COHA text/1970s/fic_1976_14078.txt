SCENE : Basically bare stage . Upstage center is a large suspended blue neon rectangle with empty space in the middle . The rectangle is lit from time to time . Behind the rectangle the upstage wall is covered by a scrim which can be backlit in different colors . Upstage , directly behind the rectangle , is a narrow platform , raised about two feet above the stage floor and running horizontally the width of the stage . When the actors enter on this platform they become framed by the rectangle . Directly center , in front of the rectangle , is a large black swivel chair with the back of it facing the audience . The back is high enough to conceal whoever is sitting in it . There is a hand-held microphone attached to one arm of the chair which is used to amplify the narration sequences . There are two copper tympani drums placed at the very edge of the stage in the down-left corner . As the audience enters , the stage is set like this with the rectangle unlit and no color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TYMPANI enter in blackout . LANX seats himself in the swivel chair with the back still facing audience so he 's unseen . TYMPANI stands facing audience behind the two drums and begins to play a slowly rising drum roll in the dark . The drumming rises in volume . The blue rectangle is lit with the rest of the stage dark . The drumming rises slowly , and with it the scrim slowly turns a pale yellow with the stage lighting still dark . TYMPANI 'S form begins to be made out in the light . He is dressed in an English working-class cap , white T-shirt , suspenders , baggy pants and heavy construction boots . He is playing the drums with mallet type sticks . His expression is very serious as he watches the audience as he plays . Slowly yellow light begins to fill the stage area as TYMPANI begins to reach a thundering pitch on the drums . The drumming and light reach their full intensity . Suddenly TYMPANI stops playing , and makes a short bow to the audience and exits left . LANX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still unseen . LANX ( as though reading from a script ) " It 's a great office . A great window . A great life . All hell passes before me , and I can watch it like a junkie . With no pain . " ( flatly , as though contained in the speech ) Yes , come in . ( RABBIT BROWN enters from right . LANX goes on talking , still unseen . RABBIT is dressed in a tattered detective 's type suit and overcoat , hat and tennis shoes . He seems fatigued . He has bundles of various sizes attached to him by long leather thongs and dragging on the floor behind him . He makes his way to center stage and stops . He scans the space for the source of LANX 'S voice . p. 3 LANX " From the blackest black to the lightest light . It 's all happening . The amazing thing to me is that despite its desolate appearance , the city teems with living things . Things crawl across upholstered seats . Deals are made in remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . A booming industry . Self-sufficient . Grossing fifty million in just two weeks . Our own private police . Our own private food . Lawyers , doctors , technical staff , a laboratory of the highest caliber . " Help yourself to anything . I 'll be with you when the time comes . ( RABBIT looks around the space for something to help himself to but finds nothing . He tries to locate the voice as LANX rambles on , getting more intense . Sax could be used underneath some of this . ) LANX " Outside , the smog strikes clean to the heart . Babies ' eyes bleed from it . Paint blisters from it . Grown men keel over . Dogs go paralyzed . Used-car lots melt away into the black macadam . The Tar Pits squirm with animal life . And all along through the terrifying shopping centers the doom merchants whisper our fate . They hide behind the grape counters twisting their bony faces at us . Pointing their narrow hands and marking our death as though they themselves stood somehow out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem that , after all these years , after all these plagues and holocausts , the city is finally being rebuilt . " ( The voice stops . LANX whirls the chair around facing front . He is short and powerfully built with his hair greased straight back , dark glasses , black suit and shoes , starched white shirt with a high collar , gold cuff links which he 's constantly snapping and adjusting , a ball point pen which he clicks continuously . In his lap he holds a few sheets of paper . He puffs and chews violently on a huge cigar and cracks his knuckles . RABBIT looks at him nervously . LANX just stares at him for a while. ) p. 4 LANX So , as pure narration , what do you think of it ? RABBIT ( looking around ) You 're asking me ? LANX You 're the Rabbit are n't ya ' ? ( RABBIT nods . ) LANX So , it 's you I 'm askin ' . What do ya ' think ? RABBIT Terrible . Old time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sits on them . ) RABBIT Worse than Jack Webb I 'd say . LANX Very good , very smart . That 's enough now . Shut up . RABBIT Did you write it ? LANX No , I did n't write it ! What do you think I am ! What kind of a question is that ! RABBIT Sorry . LANX Do n't apologize . And wet your lips . RABBIT What ? LANX Your lips ! Wet them ! Run your tongue around the outside . ( RABBIT does it . ) LANX That 's better . What 've you been , out in the elements or something ? p. 5 RABBIT It 's the smog . LANX Right . We do n't get smog in here . You 'll notice that . RABBIT Yeah . LANX We do n't tolerate it in here . Out there , yes . ( indicating toward rectangle ) It 's necessary . But in here , no . RABBIT Right . It 's very nice the way you 've got it controlled . LANX Well , it 's either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ? ( short tense laugh ) RABBIT Yeah . LANX ( suddenly serious ) So , you do n't fly , huh ? RABBIT No , I rode the buckboard down . I got a team a ' horses . Stopped off at all the missions . LANX The missions ? What for ? Missions are stupid . RABBIT To pray . LANX You stopped and prayed on the way down ? RABBIT Yeah . LANX You stopped at all the missions ? RABBIT Right . LANX Terrific . Well , it woulda ' been faster a ' course if you 'd a ' flown down . That 's gon na ' be a problem . I mean time-wise and money-wise. p. 6 RABBIT Well , I do n't fly . LANX That 's what I understand . You do n't have to repeat what I already understand . Would you like a drink or something ? RABBIT No . LANX A chair ? Would you like a chair ? It 's my job to offer things . To make offers . RABBIT Yeah , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS SCOONS ! COULD WE HAVE A CHAIR IN HERE RIGHT AWAY ! ( to RABBIT , confidentially ) What are these items you have tied to yourself ? ( MISS SCOONS enters from left . Very sexy . Short dress , high heels , typical secretary type . She carries a chair on her back , sets it downstage left and exits left again . ) RABBIT ( to LANX but watching MISS SCOONS ) Oh , these are different bundles . Some of them are medicine bundles and some are just practical bundles . LANX Well , which is which ? I 'm not a mind reader . RABBIT ( picking up one of the bundles which looks like a weasel carcass ) Well , you see this one ? This one 's particularly magical . It 's a power bundle . Extremely dangerous . It was stolen from a museum . ( RABBIT sits in the chair which MISS SCOONS brought . LANX moves down right , puffing clouds of smoke , clicking his pen , snapping his cuffs , etc. ) p. 7 LANX I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? I mean , in my book a bundle 's a bundle . To cut it short , my partner , Wheeler , and I are in kind of a jam . A little bit of a fix . We 've got ourselves in over our heads in this one particular project and uh  --  we 're looking for an ace in the hole . RABBIT ( dropping the weasel bundle to the floor ) How far in have you got yourselves ? LANX Well , in round figures let 's call it eight million . But that 's neither here nor there . The point is we need a slight miracle to boost us out , and we heard through the grapevine that you were the doctor . RABBIT That 's right . LANX Of course , I myself , personally , have never even heard of you , but your reputation seems to be widespread in the areas where we 're dependent . If you catch my drift ? RABBIT I do . LANX Very sharp . Now try to stick close to my next line of reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink . LANX ( pausing , staring hard at RABBIT , then yelling for MISS SCOONS ) MISS SCOONS ! A GLASS OF WATER PLEASE ! p. 8 RABBIT Thanks . LANX That 's quite all right . Basically , you 'll find that it 's better to be direct around here . If you want something you say so . If you do n't want something you do n't say so . Simple as that . RABBIT Right . ( MISS SCOONS enters again slowly from left balancing a glass of water on the back of her hand . She gives it to RABBIT , who takes it off her hand , then she exits . LANX continues talking through this . ) LANX Now , essentially , what 's missing at the heart of the material is a meaningful character . RABBIT That 's pretty basic , is n't it ? LANX Well , yes . But that 's why we 're considering this a state of emergency . I mean , after all we would n't have called someone in of your particular ilk if all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you 're not just that are you ? You 're not just another ordinary hack . You 're supposed to be an artist , right ? RABBIT Right . LANX A kind of magician or something . RABBIT Something like that . LANX You dream things up . p. 9 RABBIT Right . LANX Right . So what we need in this case is a three-dimensional invention . Something altogether unheard of before . We have the story , the plot , the stars , the situation , but what 's missing is this uh  --  this development . Something awesome and totally new . RABBIT I see . LANX It has to somehow transcend the very idea of " character " as we know it today . RABBIT Well , that 's a big order . LANX Exactly ! We 're prepared to pay through the teeth , of course . I mean we 're already over the budget , so what the hell . ( short laugh ) RABBIT Have you tried holographs or whatever they 're called ? LANX No , no ! You do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing technological . The real thing . RABBIT A miracle . LANX That 's right ! Right here in Culver City . RABBIT Well , I 've never exactly worked on a case like this before . I mean you want some " thing " to make an actual appearance in the middle of your movie ? LANX SHHHH ! Not so goddamn loud ! The air has ears around here . There 's spies all over the place . p. 10 RABBIT ( whispering ) But that 's the general idea , right ? LANX ( whispering ) Exactly . RABBIT ( whisper ) A kind of an apparition ? LANX Well , I do n't want to explain your business to you . I mean you could call it whatever you want . All I know is that in order to pull this budget out of the hole we 've got to have something happen that 's never ever happened before . Something unearthly . RABBIT Well , I do n't know . I mean I 'll have to have a lot more information before I can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the story , who the other characters are , the plot . All that kinda ' stuff . LANX Sure , sure . I 'll get Wheeler in here right away . He 's the backbone of the whole project . You just take it easy for a second . I 'll be right back . He 'll fill you in on all the details . ( LANX exits quickly off right leaving RABBIT alone . Slow lurking music from the saxophone is heard from offstage . Stage lights dim slightly . Scrim turns pale green . Rectangle lights up blue . RABBIT stands and gathers the bundles around him . He starts arranging them in a large circle around him as he talks directly to the audience . Sax continues underneath. ) p. 11 RABBIT ( to audience ) I make an adjustment . I 'm basically geared in the old forms . Pre-bop , Lester Young , Roscoe Holcombe . I could run a list of hip references to make your tail swim . I 've connived in the deepest cracks of the underground . Rubbed knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back Step " in places where they 've outlawed bubble gum . But that 's neither here nor there . ( The SAXOPHONE PLAYER enters from up left on the platform playing his horn . He crosses slowly into the space behind the rectangle so that he 's framed in the blue neon light with the green scrim behind him . The stage lighting continues to dim . Sax plays slow and mournful . ) RABBIT ( continuing ) The point is I 've smelled something down here . Something sending its sweet claws way up North . Interrupting my campfires . Making me daydream at night . Causing me to wonder at the life of a recluse . The vision of a celluloid tape with a series of moving images telling a story to millions . Millions anywhere . Millions seen and unseen . Millions seeing the same story without ever knowing each other . Without even having to be together . Effecting their dreams and actions . Replacing their books . Replacing their families . Replacing religion , politics , art , conversation . Replacing their minds . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I keep my distance from a machine like that ? So I wind up here , in the city of the South . Not knowing a thing but convincing them through mysterious gestures that I 'm their main man . ( he hears LANX coming ; secretly to audience ) I 'm ravenous for power but I have to conceal it . ( LANX enters fast from right with WHEELER . The lights go out behind scrim and rectangle goes out . Stage lights back up . LANX chases the SAXOPHONE PLAYER , who exits at a run off left . LANX is yelling at him as WHEELER stands sheepishly to stage right . WHEELER wears a bow tie , glasses , short-sleeved shirt , white and brown brogans , and holds a golf club which he 's constantly turning in his hand . His whole manner is shy and intimidated. ) p. 12 LANX ( to SAXOPHONE ) GET OUTA ' HERE YOU CREEP ! GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW ! I 'VE TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES I CA N'T STAND THAT SOUND ! YOU 'RE GON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RABBIT after SAX exits ) Continuously trying to reverberate us into the past with that solo crap . When will these guys wake up ? Oh , uh  --  this is Wheeler , my partner . Rabbit Brown . WHEELER ( stepping toward RABBIT shyly , offering his hand ) How do you do . ( RABBIT just stares at his hand but does n't shake . ) WHEELER I 'm afraid this is all my fault in a way . I 'm very sorry for having to bring you down all this way . LANX ( to WHEELER ) Now do n't start apologizing right off the bat . We have n't even made a deal yet . ( laughs nervously to RABBIT ) WHEELER ( to LANX ) I 'm sorry . LANX ( to RABBIT ) He 's new to the business even though he is a genius . Wishy-washy . Spineless . Came up through the cutting rooms . We got ta ' just work around him . Take it as a necessary handicap . RABBIT I 'm a little confused . p. 13 LANX You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's one a ' the first things you learn around here . Nothing is the way it appears to be . In fact , very often , it 's the opposite . RABBIT I see . LANX No you do n't . But do n't worry . RABBIT What is it exactly that you 're looking for ? WHEELER Well , we do n't know exactly . We have a hunch . We have a feeling . But we do n't know for sure . LANX Exactly . I thought I made that clear before . We have an idea that this town is ripe for another disaster . RABBIT ( pause ) Disaster ? WHEELER Cinematically speaking . ( nervous laugh ) LANX In the profit sense of the word of course . A disaster on the screen , not in the box office . ( laughs ) WHEELER Yes . You see , all of the really major box-office smashes have dealt with disaster to one degree or another . Either a disaster is about to happen , it 's already happened , or it 's actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the movie . Right now in the movie . p. 14 RABBIT Oh . WHEELER We have come to believe that it 's only through a major disaster being interjected into this picture that we 'll be able to save ourselves from total annihilation . RABBIT You mean financial ? WHEELER ( suddenly serious ) And otherwise . Have you taken a look out the window ? ( gestures toward rectangle ) ( RABBIT looks toward the rectangle then back to WHEELER without understanding his point . ) RABBIT I do n't get ya ' . WHEELER ( to LANX , amazed ) Has n't he looked out the window yet ? LANX Well , he 's just traveled the full length of California by buckboard , stopping off at all the missions on the way down . I assumed that he knows . RABBIT What 's going on anyway ? There 's nothing but a city out there . WHEELER The city is eating us alive . Ca n't you see my skin ? Look at my skin . ( WHEELER steps close to RABBIT , holding out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LANX stands by , puffing and clicking his pen. ) p. 15 WHEELER It 's turning us into snakes or lizards or something . Ca n't you feel that ? We need protection . RABBIT Oh . ( steps back away from WHEELER ) LANX What we 're getting at here , Brown , is that we 're desperate for a device . We need something which is the next step forward . A step beyond the usual , if you get my meaning . WHEELER ( sudden intense secrecy ) That 's right . Not simply an act of terror but something which will in fact drive people right off the deep end . Leave them blithering in the aisles . Create mass hypnosis . Suicide . Autodestruction . Something which will open entirely new fads in sadomasochism . Penetrating every layer of their dark subconscious and leaving them totally unrecognizable to themselves . Something which not only mirrors their own sense of doom but actually creates the possibility of it right there in front of them . That 's what the people are crying out for and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . We owe it to the public . For without the public we are nothing but a part of that public . We must stand apart , on another plane . We must rise to the challenge . We must help them devour themselves or be devoured by them . The time is ripe for this obliteration . We must rise to the occasion or be lost forever in a tidal wave of oblivion ! p. 16 RABBIT Now hold on a second , man . This sounds like something totally out of my ball park . I mean , I 'm a stunt man . I fall off horses . I 've done some sleight of hand . I 've conjured a little bit . I collect a few myths , but this sounds like you need a chemical expert or something . LANX Exactly ! A chemical expert . Very well put . Now we 've prepared this room especially for your needs . You 'll have two assistants and , of course , Miss Scoons will be at your complete disposal . RABBIT Wait a second ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how you 're coming along . Of course we do n't want to interfere with the creative process but we do need to protect our investment . RABBIT What investment ! I have n't cost you a thing yet ! LANX There is , of course , a time element involved . WHEELER Yes . ( coldly ) If , by the end of the week you have n't come up with anything useful your entire motor functioning will cease to be a private concern . You can see what it 's like outside , Brown . You can see what it 's doing to us . You can help stop it . It 's up to all of us to stop it before it 's too late . ( They both exit left , leaving RABBIT alone . He stares around the space numbly . Lights dim slightly . TYMPANI enters abruptly from left with his drumsticks and stands behind the drums . He looks at RABBIT . They are silent for a while. ) p. 17 RABBIT ( to TYMPANI ) Are you in on this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . A great window . A great life . " RABBIT Aw , knock it off ! TYMPANI ( blankly ) " The city thunders with the hollow moan of despair . " RABBIT Have they got you working on something too ? ( no answer from TYMPANI ) What 's your position , if you do n't mind my asking ? TYMPANI I play drums . RABBIT I get it . I thought it might be more complicated than that . TYMPANI They have a theory about rhythm . RABBIT I was right . TYMPANI I 'm experimenting with various rhythm structures in the hope of discovering one which will be guaranteed to produce certain trance states in masses of people . RABBIT Have you found it ? TYMPANI Not yet . I 've been here several months now . They take care of me though . I get everything I need here . It 's not a bad life . RABBIT So we 're in the same boat . p. 18 TYMPANI ( matter of factly ) No . I 'm above you . You 're below me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RABBIT Who else have they got here ? TYMPANI All kinds . I 'm not allowed to talk about it . They all like it here , though . We 're well paid . Nobody complains . RABBIT What about the saxophone player ? TYMPANI Lanx hates him . The guy wants in on the action , but Lanx ca n't stand him . Says he belongs in the wax museum . RABBIT Have you tried to escape ? TYMPANI What for ? You know what it 's like out there . In here we 're well protected . Nothing can touch us . Besides , I love the movies . I 'm proud to be a part of the industry . RABBIT You 're a sap . TYMPANI ( coldly ) Do n't talk nasty or I 'll break your back . Nobody talks nasty in here . We all get along . We eat Louis B. Mayer 's chicken soup every day . It 's a tradition . Louis is dead but his soup lives on . RABBIT I 'm gettin ' outa ' here ! ( starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . They 've already busted up your buckboard and sold your horses . On foot you 're as good as dead in this town . They 'll swallow you whole and spit you out as a tax deduction . p. 19 RABBIT Listen , I did n't ask for this ! They called me in for consultation ! That 's all ! That 's as far as it went ! TYMPANI Well , things happen fast down here . You got ta ' be prepared . One day you 're raising chickens , the next day you 're buying up half of Mexico . ( he clucks like a chicken ) RABBIT I do n't want half of Mexico ! TYMPANI Then you 'll want something else . Sooner or later you 'll want something , and they 'll find out what it is . RABBIT What do you mean ? TYMPANI Some little fantasy . Some dream . Some tiny little delusion that you 've got tucked away . They 'll pry it out of you . RABBIT What do they care ? TYMPANI Because then they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep you jumping at carrots . And you 'll keep jumping . And you 'll keep thinking you 're not jumping all the time you 're jumping . RABBIT Is that what 's happened to you ? TYMPANI What does it look like ? RABBIT Well , how can you know it and still keep doing it ? TYMPANI What else is there to do ? p. 20 RABBIT Are you crazy ? They 've got you kidnapped in here and you like it . TYMPANI So will you . You 'd be surprised how fast it happens . RABBIT Listen , Mack , no matter how many greasy skinbags think the city 's turning them into snakes it 's still better out there than it is in here ! TYMPANI Then why do n't leave ? You can walk out easy enough . ( RABBIT considers a second . Suddenly stage lights dim sharply . Rectangle lights . Scrim turns deep blue . Saxophone comes in slow , heard offstage . MISS SCOONS appears from up left on the platform reading from a notepaper and crosses slowly behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills in on the drums as RABBIT watches her . ) MISS SCOONS ( overly dramatic ) " No more pain , she cried , as they lowered half the bleeding city into a deep dark hole and covered it over with smoking rubber tires . She slowly became aware of the truth behind the power of money . The very thing she had desperately tried to avoid all these long months as she shuffled aimlessly up and down the length and breadth of the City of Angels with a toothpick in her hand . Now it stood before her . Glaring down like some awesome demented saint . Its teeth chattering through rusted-out alleyways . Its breath blowing lasciviously at her gingham skirt . All innocence was now behind her . All dreams of the life of man free and unfettered as she once knew it was on the plains of Nebraska . Here was the hard-core cement . The concrete reality of the dreaming-machine . The terrifying destruction which faced her head-on was now met by her own indivisible courage which she felt welling up from some deep primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear . In her mind 's eye was a simple equation . It appeared like a flashlight in a hooker 's nightmare . Money equals power , equals protection , equals eternal life. And with that she collapsed at the foot of La Cienaga . " ( Sax stops , drums stop , stage lights back up . Special lights out . MISS SCOONS stands on the platform smiling down at RABBIT , who stares at her in disbelief. ) p. 21 RABBIT What was that ? MISS SCOONS ( jumping down from platform ) Something I cooked up at the commissary during my lunch break . What do ya ' think ? RABBIT Great stuff . Really great . MISS SCOONS Really ? You think it 'll sell ? RABBIT Positive . MISS SCOONS What did you think of it , Tympani ? TYMPANI It 's all right . A little wordy maybe . MISS SCOONS That 's what I was thinking . Sort of too much showing off . Too many big words maybe . RABBIT No , I do n't think so . In fact , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . MISS SCOONS Gee , thanks . TYMPANI You mean like , " some deep primeval source which she knew not of ' ? RABBIT Well , that was a little sticky in that area , but otherwise I thought it was surprisingly original . MISS SCOONS Well , it is based on my own experience . RABBIT I could tell . It had that kind of a ring . MISS SCOONS Do you think I ought a ' present it at the next tribunal ? p. 22 RABBIT Sure , why not . TYMPANI Are you kidding ? MISS SCOONS No , I 'm not kidding , as a matter of fact . I wan na ' advance my position . I ca n't remain a secretary forever . TYMPANI You show up with that kinda ' crap they 're gon na ' cut you right back to part-time lab duty . That stuff is strictly third rate . MISS SCOONS What do you know , beef sticks ! You ca n't even come up with a simple thing like an original rhythm . TYMPANI All I know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda ' drivel . That went out with Raymond Chandler . RABBIT Yeah , he 's right . Ayn Rand sorta ' did it to death too . MISS SCOONS That 's the trouble , ya ' know . RABBIT What ? MISS SCOONS Nobody knows what 's good . Everybody 's too easily swayed . One minute it 's great , the next minute it 's garbage . You have to just go on your own intuition . ( suddenly noticing RABBIT 'S bundles ) What are these things you have tied to yourself anyway ? Nobody 's ever showed up here with things tied to them like that before . RABBIT I 'm working on something for the big fellas . Special project . ( RABBIT and TYMPANI exchange looks. ) p. 23 MISS SCOONS Really ? You need any help ? RABBIT Well , yeah . Sure . I mean I do n't know exactly what it is I 'm doing yet , but I sure could use some help . TYMPANI Nobody helped me when I was in a jam . MISS SCOONS When were you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just like him when I first got here , and nobody helped me . RABBIT Well , I 'll help ya ' . We can all help each other . TYMPANI Too late . MISS SCOONS That 's for sure in your case . TYMPANI ( to MISS SCOONS ) At least I have a firm position . A title . MISS SCOONS Yeah , " Frozen in the Act of Creation . " RABBIT Listen , I 'm not sure if I can accurately assess the danger that we 're in here , but I have a feeling we ought a ' come up with something fast . I mean these guys are desperate . One of ' em 's skin is crawling . ( TYMPANI smiles at RABBIT , satisfied that he 's swallowed the bait . ) MISS SCOONS Yeah , that 's what I been saying all along . We should try to put our heads together and work as a team . p. 24 RABBIT I mean they even threatened me . Did they ever threaten you ? MISS SCOONS Oh yeah , every once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole approach . RABBIT I mean , did n't you uh  --  get scared or anything ? MISS SCOONS Scared ? What for ? They 're just crazy , that 's all . Nothin ' to worry about . RABBIT But are n't you being held here against your will ? ( MISS SCOONS looks to TYMPANI for an explanation . TYMPANI shrugs . ) MISS SCOONS What 's got into this guy ? ( back to RABBIT ) Do I look like a prisoner to you ? RABBIT No , I guess not . Well , look , maybe we can fool them . TYMPANI Hah ! You must have a screw loose or something . Lanx and Wheeler have been through every trick in the book . RABBIT Yeah , but what if we could come up with a character that nobody 's ever seen before . Something in flesh and blood . Not just an idea but something so incredible that as soon as they came in contact with it they 'd pass out or go into convulsions or something . That 's what they 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 RABBIT We 'd have to invent it . Right here . Between the three of us . MISS SCOONS That 's fantastic ! What an idea ! A real live experiment ! TYMPANI It 'll never work . RABBIT How come ? MISS SCOONS Like a monster or something ! TYMPANI First of all , because they 're looking for something beyond the imagination . Something impossible . RABBIT Well , if they can imagine the possibility of it maybe we can imagine the thing itself . MISS SCOONS Yeah , it 'd be a great challenge , Tympani . You could get that diner that you 're always talking about . RABBIT What diner ? MISS SCOONS ( to RABBIT ) He 's always wanted a diner , ever since he was a little boy . TYMPANI SHUT UP ! MISS SCOONS Well , it 's true is n't it ? You 're always talking about it . TYMPANI I 'm not always talking about it ! I mentioned it once ! RABBIT Take it easy . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . TYMPANI I 'M NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Jesus , I could care less if you 've always wanted to have a diner . I happen to like diners . TYMPANI I HAVE N'T ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A DINER ! RABBIT Oh , brother . MISS SCOONS He 'll be okay in a minute . Shall I get us all some coffee ? RABBIT Sure . ( MISS SCOONS turns toward the rectangle as though to leave but stops suddenly . She seems to go into a hypnotic state and just stares at the rectangle . ) RABBIT What 's the matter , Miss Scoons ? ( She speaks in a kind of flattened monotone , almost as if another voice is speaking through her . ) MISS SCOONS I look at the screen and I am the screen . I 'm not me . I do n't know who I am . I look at the movie and I am the movie . I am the star . I am the star in the movie . For days I am the star and I 'm not me . I 'm me being the star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look and I hate my life when I come down . I hate my life not being a movie . I hate my life not being a star . I hate being myself in my life which is n't a movie and never will be . I hate having to eat . Having to work . Having to sleep . Having to go to the bathroom . Having to get from one place to another with no potential . Having to live in this body which is n't a star 's body and all the time knowing that stars exist . That there are people doing nothing all their life except being in movies . Doing nothing but swimming and drinking and laughing and being driven to places full of potential . People never having to feel hot pavement or having to look at weeds growing through cracks in the city . People never having to look the city square in the eyes . People living in dreams which are the same dreams I 'm dreaming but never living . ( She suddenly snaps out of it and exits left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 27 RABBIT Is she all right ? TYMPANI I do n't know . RABBIT What 's going on around here anyway ? Does n't anybody know each other ? TYMPANI What 's to know ? RABBIT Well , I mean , you see each other every day , do n't you ? TYMPANI Look , do n't go gettin ' humanitarian on me , mister . The environment ca n't take it . RABBIT What environment ? TYMPANI This is a city . RABBIT So what ? TYMPANI We 're the brain of the city . The brain 's demented . It 's a demented brain . You understand ? If we disturb that demented condition , the city will collapse around us . Now you do n't want that to happen , do you ? RABBIT Is that what Wheeler 's afraid of ? TYMPANI ( menacing ) Do n't poke too deep , you 're still on the guest list . ( RABBIT stops short . Pause . ) RABBIT Do n't you ever sit down ? TYMPANI No . RABBIT You wo n't mind if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits upstage in the black swivel chair , facing front . TYMPANI stays behind the drums facing front . ) RABBIT You 're always standing ? TYMPANI Always . Waiting for it to happen . RABBIT What " it " ? TYMPANI " It . " RABBIT Oh . " It . " TYMPANI The rhythm . The one , special , **25;425;TOOLONG rhythm which will drive men crazy . RABBIT That 's a tough one . TYMPANI It 's possible . RABBIT Sure . I guess . TYMPANI ( facing front ) One time I could almost taste it . I was standing here just like this . I was playing a standard four-four cross pattern . I 'd been into it for maybe half an hour when I began to feel something taking over my left wrist . I was curious at first because I 'd never had quite that kind of a feeling enter into a simple four-four pattern before . It was like I could hear a whole other shape and sound to the basic structure . Something behind what I was playing . Then I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the pattern . It was n't me . It was a different body . Then I got scared . I panicked when I saw that , and right away I lost it . It just vanished like that , and I never have come across it again . p. 29 RABBIT It 'll come back . TYMPANI What do you know ? Your optimism is n't reassuring ; it 's stupid . You ca n't make me feel better about it , because I already know what it is . I know it 's lost and I 'll never find my way back to it . It was the chance of a lifetime . RABBIT So now you 're just taking up space ? TYMPANI I 'm facing my death . ( Loud screech from the saxophone offstage . RABBIT suddenly whirls the swivel chair around so it 's facing upstage . At the same time the lights go black and the rectangle is lit . The scrim turns dark red . TYMPANI pulls the other chair downstage center , facing front , and sits in it like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S voice is heard but he is unseen . ) RABBIT ( little kid voice ) I love the newsreels ! I could watch the newsreels forever ! TYMPANI ( little kid voice ) Not me . News is stupid . It has a stupid voice . Sounds like a grown-up . Grown-ups sounding important and not knowing they 're stupid . RABBIT ( adult newscaster voice ) A two-headed St. Bernard was born to normal parents in Grand Rapids , Michigan . The pup was the only one in the litter , which is unusual for St. Bernards . ( LANX enters on the platform up left in boxer shorts , black boxing shoes , towel around his neck and swollen eyes , his nose bleeding profusely . He is raising his arms to a distant cheering audience , in victory . He crosses into the rectangle and keeps acknowledging his audience silently. ) p. 30 TYMPANI I wan na ' see the one where they find the guy 's face in the vacant lot full of shotgun holes . RABBIT ( newscaster voice ) The mother died in birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still uncertain as to the exact cause of death ; however , they believe the unusual size of the double-headed baby may be at the root of it . TYMPANI That could never happen in this town . Too many cops . RABBIT ( newscaster ) Tom Mix got caught stealing towels from the Beverly Wilshire and refused to make a comment . TYMPANI I wish it would happen in this town . Would n't that be neat ? A real murder right here . Where they ca n't find who did it and everybody 's scared to go to bed at night ! RABBIT The Howdy Doody Show will not be seen on television this season due to a contractual disagreement between the producers . The Sheriff John Show will fill in the missing slot . ( Sax backup . Suddenly LANX starts talking from the rectangle as though he were being interviewed . Sax builds through this . ) LANX Yeah , I love fightin ' in this town . There 's somethin ' about the atmosphere here . The people . The people love me here . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I love it . I go back to Jersey City and I 'm just another mug , ya ' know what I mean ? But out here in the West they can appreciate a real boxer , ya ' know ? I mean I give the people what they want . They like to see some action when they come to the fights . They do n't wan na ' see a couple of GIs up there doin ' the fox-trot all over the canvas . They wan na ' see some boxin ' . And that 's what I 'm here for . And the fans know that . They know when they come to a Jimmy Muldoon fight that they 're gon na ' see the real stuff . They 're gon na ' see some leather thumpin ' ! ( Sax fades to low backup . LANX continues talking to his audience in mime as RABBIT and TYMPANI go on . LANX shadowboxes in the rectangle. ) p. 31 RABBIT ( newscaster ) The kidnapping has stirred the emotions of millions . Everywhere the voice of outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old lady ) Such a sweet little boy too . All alone in the bedroom with the wind blowing the curtains . Only a monster could have dreamed of such a thing . ( LANX cuts back in with his voice . ) LANX Well , I figure I got maybe two or three good years left . You know how it is in this profession . Here today , gone tomorrow . ( laughs ) Anyway , I figure there 's a future for me right here in Hollywood . I mean , I still got my looks and my muscle to get me through . I 've already been talkin ' to a major studio about doin ' my life story . Soon 's a good offer comes along I just might take it . Who knows ? Anyhow , I just wan na ' wish all my fans in L.A. the best of luck and thanks for supportin ' me and helpin ' me to become a challenger for the title . Thanks a million . ( LANX raises his arms in victory and waves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouts like a little kid to his mother upstairs . ) TYMPANI I just wan na ' go to the movies , Ma ! I do n't care about anything else ! Just the movies ! I do n't care about school or homework or college or jobs or marriage or kids or insurance or front lawns or mortgage or even the light of day ! I do n't care if I never see the sun again , Ma ! Just send me to the dark , dark movies ! ( Rising sax . Sound of mass applause . LANX exits right , shadowboxing as he goes . Rectangle goes unlit . Scrim out . Stage lights back up . RABBIT whirls the chair around facing front again . RABBIT and TYMPANI freeze a second . Sudden silence as MISS SCOONS enters slowly trying not to spill two Dixie cups full of coffee . She crosses to center stage and sets the cups down extremely slowly on the floor , so as not to spill them . This sequence should be almost in slow motion . Once she has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal tempo. ) p. 32 MISS SCOONS All I could find was Dixie cups . Wheeler smashed all the real cups the other day . Went totally crazy . Better drink these fast before the wax melts . Makes the coffee taste really weird . TYMPANI ( leaving chair and crossing back to drums ) I do n't want any coffee . Makes my teeth itch . Bad enough with smog choking you , making your eyes run , cops giving you walking tickets . Everything 's bad enough without coffee to make things worse . MISS SCOONS Well , that 's just perfect because I only brought two cups anyway ! TYMPANI What is coffee anyway ! Some goddamn bean they invented to make you stay up late . ( RABBIT gets up from the chair and picks up a cup of coffee . MISS SCOONS sits in the other chair . ) RABBIT I 've got an idea . MISS SCOONS Great . RABBIT What if we start with ourselves . One of us . TYMPANI What do you mean , one of us ? RABBIT One of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be transformed into this character they 're looking for . TYMPANI Back to that again . It 's not just a character . Why ca n't you get that straight ? If they were just looking for a character they 'd be going through the casting agencies . They want a phenomenon . p. 33 RABBIT Why 're you in such a bad mood all of a sudden ? TYMPANI I have no good moods ! Every mood I have is a variation on a bad mood . Good moods do n't fit into the scheme of things . Good moods are stupid ! GOOD MOODS ARE WORSE THAN DIXIE CUPS ! MISS SCOONS ( to RABBIT ) I 'll volunteer . RABBIT Great , Miss Scoons will be the guinea pig . TYMPANI ( to audience ) And suddenly they were all transported to the world of magic . RABBIT This coffee tastes really weird . MISS SCOONS It 's the wax melting . RABBIT Oh . MISS SCOONS Come on , Tymp , you can sit in the director 's chair . It 'll be fun . TYMPANI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooney and Judy Garland get their big break and move to Philadelphia with the Dorsey brothers ? What is this ? We 're in the middle of a dung heap here . Where do you think we are anyway ? You do n't work your way up from the bottom anymore . You rip flesh ! You tear your eyeballs out and watch them get kicked down the street . MISS SCOONS ( to RABBIT ) He 's had some bad breaks . p. 34 TYMPANI It does n't work that way anymore ! Nobody gets breaks ! You get broken in half ! MISS SCOONS Just relax for a while . Let 's just try this idea he has . You got nothing to lose . Just pretend everything 's all right . Pretend you 've had so many successes that now you 're retired and living in the East . Boston or Maine or someplace cozy . You can afford to relax . You have a golden retriever at your feet , The New York Times Review of Books in your lap , an after-dinner mint in your mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of Hollywood put together . You 're known as " The Master of Disaster . " ( TYMPANI 's mood begins to change as RABBIT crosses to him and escorts him upstage to the black swivel chair and sits him down in it . He coaxes him along with his voice . ) RABBIT That 's right . Pretend you 've been called from a faraway place by the head chiefs of the whole city . You 're the only one who can solve the mystery . Millions and millions are riding solely on your powers of imagination . There 's nobody quite like you on the entire planet . You 've been called in on similar cases and solved every one of them . But this is something special . This is the case to end all cases . Even you , with all your powers , with all your stature and reputation , are left somewhat puzzled and dumbfounded . Even you , the High Prophet of Disaster . The Master himself . ( TYMPANI begins to take on the characteristics which RABBIT attributes to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded in his lap . He speaks with an air of authority. ) p. 35 TYMPANI ( to RABBIT ) So tell me  --  this particular entity , I assume it 's evil ? RABBIT ( deep voice ) Can any fear be construed as good ? TYMPANI That is not my question ! I 'm not here to dillydally in quasi-philosophical meanderings ! I 'm here to solve a problem . RABBIT But you see , the consistent product of this being is paralyzing fear . Even in its dormant state it can produce severe nausea and depression . TYMPANI Would we be safe in assuming then , at the outset at least , that this " thing " is more a kind of force than anything resembling a character ? RABBIT We could assume , yes . TYMPANI Good . Then let 's begin . ( Low lurking sax music bleeds in from offstage . Lights shift . MISS SCOONS becomes very still in her chair as RABBIT moves steadily around the space . TYMPANI remains in the swivel chair with hands folded . Green light on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , somehow , at the present , inhabiting the body of a woman . TYMPANI What is her age ? RABBIT The age of the body or the " thing " ? p. 36 TYMPANI THE BODY , OF COURSE ! RABBIT In its twenties , roughly . TYMPANI Roughly ? How roughly ? RABBIT Mid-twenties . TYMPANI Thank you . RABBIT Can you picture it now ? TYMPANI DO N'T RUSH ME ! RABBIT Sorry . TYMPANI I 'm having difficulty with the form . RABBIT We could change it to a man . TYMPANI DO N'T BE STUPID ! That 's not the form I mean . I ca n't go from drums to this just like a duck to water . RABBIT Oh . TYMPANI I need some time to work into it . RABBIT Well , take your time then . TYMPANI Could you stand her up for me ? RABBIT Yeah , sure . ( RABBIT goes to MISS SCOONS and stands her up . She stands very still , staring straight ahead as though hypnotized . TYMPANI faces out and does n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . p. 37 RABBIT Well , she 's not . Not now . TYMPANI She seems abnormally normal in fact . What 's the matter with her ? RABBIT Nothing 's the matter with her ! We have to cook up something that 's the matter with her ! That 's the whole point . We have to transform her . TYMPANI But maybe that 's where the terror lies . RABBIT Where ? TYMPANI In her very normalness . She 's terrifyingly normal . RABBIT Are you kidding ! That wo n't sell . TYMPANI No . She passes herself off as one of us , but then these weird events take place . She demolishes entire populations with her normalness . She enters an advanced civilization where deranged citizens rule the planets . Her normalness destroys them utterly . RABBIT That wo n't scare anybody ! TYMPANI So , the only alternative is to make her grotesque , then . It 's either one or the other . RABBIT We have to go beyond that ! This is a challenge ! TYMPANI It 's either an Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? RABBIT There must be something in between . p. 38 TYMPANI But that 's totally boring . RABBIT How do you know ? TYMPANI ( getting up from chair , quits the game ) Because that 's where we are right now ! IN BETWEEN ! ( Lights come up again . Sax stops . MISS SCOONS keeps swaying hypnotically back and forth . ) RABBIT ( to TYMPANI ) What 's the matter ? TYMPANI The matter is that you 're trying to approach this whole thing in an ordinary way . Like an amateur sance or something . I mean we 're just fishing around in the dark for some kind of vague creepiness . This is an eight-million-dollar project you 're talking about ! RABBIT Well , what 's your idea then ? TYMPANI I DO N'T HAVE AN IDEA ! I already told you . It 's impossible . I do n't want any part of this thing . RABBIT Great . TYMPANI ( returning to drums ) It 's your predicament , not mine . I 'm already sidetracked enough as it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly on the drums . MISS SCOONS starts to sway more intensely . Pause . She slowly starts moving around the stage in a trance . Sax comes in underneath. ) p. 39 RABBIT ( to TYMPANI who continues drumming softly ) I do n't see it that way . TYMPANI What way ? RABBIT Yours or mine . If one of us escapes , we all escape . TYMPANI I 'm not looking to escape ! This is my job ! I like it here . Stop trying to squeeze me out of a good thing . MISS SCOONS ( to herself , still moving ; drum continues ) In those days God had no need to create anything apart from himself . He was self-contained . RABBIT ( to MISS SCOONS ) God ? MISS SCOONS ( dancing slowly , speaking in trance ) There was such an overflow of divine love that the angels came bursting forth of their own accord . Circle upon circle of spirit lights radiantly dashing the heavens , whirling about the sun in clouds of crystal fragments . RABBIT ( to SCOONS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devils ! Serpents , not angels ! What 's the matter with you people ! You should know what 's commercial by now . MISS SCOONS They were blasted out of eternal sleep by the blinding light of a direct vision of Glory . So devastating was this light that only their flaming wings could offer protection from this fire that also gave them their birth . p. 40 RABBIT ( to SCOONS ) We have to work on fear , not glory ! Terror ! Devastation ! That 's where the money is ! Devastation ! MISS SCOONS And all at once they began to sing . All nine choirs in descending rank . ( RABBIT turns to TYMPANI . MISS SCOONS whirls around the stage in ecstasy . TYMPANI 'S rhythm on the drums builds . Sax fills in behind . ) RABBIT What is the most frightening thing in the world ? TYMPANI ( blankly ) A space . ( he continues drums ) RABBIT What is the most frightening thing in the whole world ? TYMPANI A life cut off from all life . RABBIT What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RABBIT ( pacing ) WHAT IS THE MOST FRIGHTENING THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD ! TYMPANI Dying . RABBIT WHAT IS MORE FRIGHTENING THAN ANYTHING ELSE ? TYMPANI Dying alone . RABBIT WHAT IS IT THAT EVERYBODY IS SCARED OF ! p. 41 TYMPANI The expectation of a death unknown . RABBIT What is fear ! TYMPANI THE IMAGINATION OF DYING ! RABBIT Now we 're getting somewhere ! TYMPANI Now we 're cooking ! RABBIT THE IMAGINATION OF DYING IS MORE SCARY THAN ACTUALLY DYING ! TYMPANI How do you know ? RABBIT I assume . TYMPANI You assume , but you do n't know . RABBIT Having never died my death , I assume that imagining it is more scary than doing it . TYMPANI You do n't do it . It does it by itself . RABBIT Yes . That 's true . That must be true . TYMPANI But you do n't know . RABBIT I do n't know . ( Through this the rhythm from TYMPANI 'S drumming is getting more frenetic . MISS SCOONS dances with more and more abandon . RABBIT paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOWING IS MORE SCARY THAN KNOWING . p. 42 TYMPANI But since you do n't know you can only assume . RABBIT NOT KNOWING WHEN OR HOW OR WHY OR WHERE ! TYMPANI But only that you will . RABBIT I will . I WILL DIE ! TYMPANI HE WILL ! RABBIT We all will . TYMPANI You will . RABBIT So will you . TYMPANI WE ALL WILL DIE AND NOT KNOW HOW OR WHY OR WHERE ! RABBIT AND THAT IS WHAT 'S FRIGHTENING BEYOND ALL REASON ! TYMPANI AND THAT 'S WHAT MAKES A BOX OFFICE SMASH ! RABBIT AND THAT 'S WHAT MAKES AN INDUSTRY ! TYMPANI AND THAT 'S WHAT MAKES A MILLION BUCKS ! RABBIT WE 'VE GOT IT ! WE 'VE GOT IT ! MISS SCOONS ! WE 'VE GOT IT ! Miss Scoons ? ( Sax stops . Drums stop . MISS SCOONS is frozen in place , center stage . She speaks as though in a trance . ) MISS SCOONS You have n't got a thing . None of us has got a thing . We 're only going in circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're only getting nowhere . We 're going nowhere fast . p. 43 RABBIT No , we 've really hit on something ! Tympani and me . We both discovered something while you were dancing . MISS SCOONS It 's nothing . You only got excited by the sound of your own voice . There 's nothing in here . The city 's dead . The living are replacements for the dead . Nothing moves in this town . TYMPANI She 'll be all right . RABBIT I thought we had something there . ( to TYMPANI ) Did n't you feel like we were onto something ? TYMPANI I do n't know . RABBIT Boy , you people are really weird . TYMPANI You do n't know what weirdness is , chump . ( LANX enters fast from right , dressed in his suit again , puffing on his cigar . He stops center stage next to MISS SCOONS and glares at all of them . ) LANX What 's going on ! I 'm not paying you to stand around salivating ! Do you realize what 's happening ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely green and his top layer is beginning to peel ! RABBIT We 've been trying our damndest to come up with something . LANX THAT 'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH ! THIS IS CULVER CITY , NOT THE BORSCHT CIRCUIT ! WE DEAL IN HARD-CORE PRODUCTS ! CASH ON THE LINE ! p. 44 RABBIT It 's not my fault ! I ca n't work with these people ! They do n't have any gumption ! All the fire 's gone out of them . MISS SCOONS ( still in trance ) The Cherubim . The Seraphim . The Thrones . The Dominions . LANX THEN DO IT ON YOUR OWN ! RABBIT Where ? In this nuthouse ? I want a suite of my own with room service . I deserve better than this . I 'M AN ARTIST , GODDAMNIT ! I CAME ALL THIS WAY BY BUCKBOARD ! MISS SCOONS The messengers of God . LANX ( to RABBIT ) That 's very quaint , but that 's not the point . The point is that you came . Something drew you down here to us . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe it . Money . RABBIT That 's right . So what ? LANX So do n't go pulling rank on me with that " Artist " crap ! You 're no better than any of us . RABBIT That 's not what I meant . LANX You thought you 'd come down and whip off a few quick lines , collect a little traveling expenses and a fat contract , and then sashay on outa ' here . Right ? p. 45 MISS SCOONS ( trance ) The urge to create works of art is essentially one of ambition . The ambition behind the urge to create is no different from any other ambition . To kill . To win . To get on top . LANX What 's got into her ? RABBIT Part of our experiment . MISS SCOONS Greed is greed . LANX Why is she talking like that ! She 's never talked like that before . I ca n't even follow it . TYMPANI You know what I think ? I think it was the rhythm I was playing . THAT MUST BE IT ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you we were onto something ! TYMPANI THAT 'S IT , LANX ! THAT 'S IT ! LOOK , SHE 'S COMPLETELY ZONKED OUT ! MISS SCOONS The Angel is against all evil . He appears in the midst of destruction . LANX What 's going on ! Miss Scoons , snap out of it ! TYMPANI No , you do n't understand . I was playing a rhythm on the drums and she was moving to it . I must 've hit on the one that I was looking for and did n't even know it . LANX So what ! If you did n't know it then , you still do n't know it . p. 46 TYMPANI But I could find it again ! I could trace it down ! LANX What I want to know is what are we going to do about Wheeler ! If he goes under , all of us go with him ! ( MISS SCOONS travels around the space and speaks with a different voice . TYMPANI watches her closely . ) MISS SCOONS The ambition to transform valleys into cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To make things safe . To beat death . To be victorious in the face of absolute desolation . LANX Whose script is that ? Where did she memorize that ? TYMPANI It 's coming from her ! LANX Do n't give me that ! I recognize the style . Sounds like Fritz Lang or early Howard Hawks . RABBIT She 's going to need some help . Is there a doctor around ? LANX There are no doctors in this town . They 've all been sued to death . What 's the matter with you ! We 're all on the verge of disaster , and you talk about it like it was a simple medical problem . Wheeler 's condition can only be solved by you ! RABBIT But what about Miss Scoons ? LANX She does n't count ! Only Wheeler counts ! His condition is precarious ! p. 47 RABBIT But I do n't care about Wheeler one way or the other . LANX Then you have no business in this business ! RABBIT Then let me go ! LANX NO ! RABBIT This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Principalities . The Archangels . The Angels . TYMPANI ( watching MISS SCOONS ) I think she 's going deeper . She 's definitely contacting other entities . Listen to her breathing . LANX GET HER OUT OF HERE ! SHE 'S UPSETTING THE WHOLE PROJECT ! MISS SCOONS El Pueblo de Nuestra Seora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncuta . En la ciudad . En todo el mundo . La muerte , sta es el rey supremo . Viva la muerte ! LANX PLEASE ! I NEED SOME KIND OF ORDER ! SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT ! WHEELER 'S SKIN IS TURNING GREEN ! WE 'LL ALL BE EATEN ALIVE ! ( From this point on everyone is in their own world . They speak to themselves . ) TYMPANI I have a diner in my dream . One diner . RABBIT What 's keeping me from leaving ? I could leave . Nobody 's holding a gun to my head . p. 48 LANX It 's not the same for me . My power lies in manipulation . If no one is manipulated , then I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basically green . Pale green walls . Chrome stools with black leatherette seats . Everyone 's face is reflected in those stools . MISS SCOONS The Spanish took over . The Spanish Hunger . Spanish stomachs made a sound that rumbled through these canyons . You can still hear it in some parts . The Spanish had no idea they 'd ever be in the movies . LANX There has to be some form ! Even chaos has a form ! TYMPANI The main dish is chicken gumbo . Served on Saint 's Day . The Chef 's Special . People go a hundred miles out of their way just to taste it . RABBIT It 's me ! It 's me who wants to stay ! I could leave but I 'm staying . MISS SCOONS Absolute greed devoured them whole . Their viciousness was beyond belief . Tearing the gold teeth from half-dead victims . Crushing jade jaguars into green dust . They set the stage with Catholic blood . LANX ( looking out through rectangle ) Once there was an industry ! A magnificent industry ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like serfs spawning at the feet of their master . Then there was order ! Everyone knew their place ! p. 49 TYMPANI In one corner is a chrome jukebox with nothing but Hank Snow records . RABBIT ( to audience ) I 'm staying and I do n't regret it . MISS SCOONS Their voraciousness knew no bounds . They were a bottomless pit . ( WHEELER rushes on from stage right . Everyone stops . WHEELER 'S skin has turned green , big open sores on his face and arms . He is panting for breath . He screams in desperation . ) WHEELER WHERE 'S MY DISASTER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( Lights black out . Sax rushes into high wailing riff and continues into blackout ) @x SCENE : Same basic set as Act 1 . LANX can be heard shadowboxing in the dark . He makes the sharp exhaling sound of a boxer when he throws a punch . The stage lights rise slowly on TYMPANI , dressed up in a chef 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . He is using the two tympani drums as a make-believe griddle . WHEELER is seated in the swivel chair , upstage , facing the audience . His skin is a slimy green . He now has two fangs and extra-long fingernails . His posture is slumped over and painful . He seems to be having trouble breathing , and in general his health has depleted considerably . Downstage right , on the floor on hands and knees , MISS SCOONS is scrubbing the floor with a big brush and a bucket full of soapy water . She is dressed as a nun and speaks with a light Irish accent . Center stage , RABBIT is laying out the bundles to form a large circle on the floor . WHEELER watches his every move very closely , as though his life depended on it . LANX is dressed in a suit , but his hands are bandaged and bloody . His nose has a wide bandage across it , and his eyes are black and blue . He shadowboxes around the loose space . MISS SCOONS sings softly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LANX keeps boxing the air . TYMPANI cooks and WHEELER watches RABBIT . MISS SCOONS ( singing ) I could 've married a thistledownOr Jesus Christ hisselfOr climbed a holy mountaintopOr built a ship meself But , no , I cast meself to seaAnd sailed for foreign turfWhereupon I climbed the highest treeAnd searched for my sweet homeAnd searched for my sweet home ( Lights up full . They are all silent for a while but continue with their actions . The dominant sound is WHEELER 'S heavy , rasping breathing and LANX 'S punches. ) p. 51 WHEELER ( to RABBIT , having difficulty speaking ) I ca n't understand the necessity for getting so elaborate with the design . RABBIT ( as he works , arranging bundles ) Well , under ordinary circumstances I 'd plunge right in and just see what I 'd come up with by chance . But this situation seems to call for a more traditional approach . TYMPANI ( to LANX , cooking imaginary eggs ) Did you say you wanted those over-easy or straight up ? LANX ( still boxing air ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . If the whites are n't firm you do n't get the full nutrition from the egg . Might as well eat it raw . An athlete has to watch his eggs . TYMPANI Right . Do n't worry . I 'm used to this kind of cooking . Sugar Ray used to stop in here on his way to the Garden . Now there was a finicky eater . WHEELER ( to RABBIT ) What do you mean by traditional ? RABBIT There 's a long history to the Medicine Wheel . I 'm just learning it myself . WHEELER That 's what you call this ? A Medicine Wheel ? RABBIT That 's what the Indians called it . p. 52 WHEELER Do n't get cute . I 'm not interested in ethnic origins . RABBIT Well , we 're taking a risk any way you look at it . WHEELER Why 's that ? RABBIT This was always used for prayer , not destruction . WHEELER Well , this is n't for destruction . It 's for entertainment . MISS SCOONS Oh , Mister Wheeler , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the alcoves ? WHEELER Is she talking to me ? MISS SCOONS Aye , it 's you , Mister Wheeler , that I 'm addressin ' . WHEELER ( standing suddenly ) What 's happened in here ! Something 's happened in here since I was last here ! I want to know what it is ! The air smells different . ( The rest continue , ignoring WHEELER . LANX tries to comfort him . ) LANX Do n't worry , buddy . It 's just the smog . The smog and the Spanish . We 're doing something about both problems . We 've got our man on it right now . They ca n't get away with it for long . WHEELER I do n't understand what 's going on . Have I changed as much as you ? p. 53 LANX We 're exactly the same , old buddy . Everything 's exactly the same . I 'm in top condition . Look at me pivot ! ( LANX pivots for WHEELER . ) WHEELER Show me the window ! I WANT TO SEE THE WINDOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to himself ) Cripples and lames . Cripples and lames . All the same as far as I 'm concerned . I see all kinds in here . They come and go . All I do is cook and watch . LANX ( at window with WHEELER ) There now . Just take a gander out there ! Is n't that something . The " City of Angels " ! Magnificent ! Just like it always was . Palm trees . Duck ponds . Sculptured hedges . WHEELER WHAT 'S HAPPENED TO THE LEMON ORCHARDS ! LANX Now take it easy . Those were plowed under to make room for the new lots . WHEELER ( backing away from window as if about to faint ; LANX supports him ) Oh , my God , I feel I 'm going to die right here . What 's happening to me . The entire scenery 's changed ! LANX It 'll be okay . Just sit back down and take a load off . Would ya ' like something to eat ? ( LANX escorts him back to the swivel chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't keep it down . Everything 's shrunken inside me . I can feel it . All my organs are tiny . LANX How ' bout some nice chicken broth ? WHEELER NO ! LEAVE ME ALONE , YOU IDIOT ! LANX ( backing off ) Yessir . WHEELER Are you taking care of me ? Is that it ? Am I an invalid now ? LANX Well , someone 's got to look after you . WHEELER What about these others ? What are they doing here ? LANX Working on the project , sir . WHEELER Project ? What project ! LANX The disaster . WHEELER Oh , that . Do you still think it 's worth it ? Are n't we beyond that now ? LANX Hard to say . Seems like our only choice now . WHEELER ( suddenly switching ) YES IT IS ! OF COURSE IT IS ! You do n't have to tell me that . Of course it 's our only chance . It always was our only chance . It 's our purpose for being here . Right from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? LANX " Choice , " I said , not " chance . " p. 55 WHEELER AND I SAID " CHANCE " ! ! LANX Yessir . WHEELER Go on boxing , will you . You make me nervous when you talk . LANX Yessir . WHEELER You 're not a good talker . You 're dumb , in fact . In fact you never should be allowed to open your yap . LANX Yessir . ( LANX begins to shadowbox again . ) WHEELER Box your ass off ! It 's the only way you 'll understand the importance of a dollar . LANX You 're right , sir . WHEELER And wet your lips ! Your lips ! LANX Yessir ! ( wets his lips with his tongue as he boxes ) WHEELER You 're not just another boxer , you 're a personality now . You have to look good . Above all else , you have to look good . LANX Yessir . WHEELER ( to himself ) The whole business has gone to pot . TYMPANI ( to himself , referring to WHEELER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Mister Wheeler ? p. 56 WHEELER ( looking around for the voice ) Who 's that talking ! RABBIT It 's Miss Scoons , I think . WHEELER Why is she talking like that ? RABBIT Tympani and I were conducting an experiment , and in the middle of it Miss Scoons fell into a trauma of some kind . TYMPANI ( to RABBIT ) Do n't explain it . He had his chance already . LANX ( still boxing ) " Choice , " I said ! WHEELER I do n't understand ! RABBIT Something to do with rhythm . TYMPANI ( to RABBIT ) Do n't explain it . I 'm cooking now ! WHEELER Yes , we had a man on that once . A young man . Worked for several months and then died mysteriously . What happened to that young man we had , Lanx ? LANX He 's still with us , sir . WHEELER YOU JUST KEEP BOXING ! LANX Yessir . WHEELER You 've got a press conference in two hours . MISS SCOONS Mister Wheeler ? p. 57 WHEELER What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? WHEELER Maybe and maybe not . MISS SCOONS How come the tide has turned ? How come now the people want disasters ? I mean what 's happened to all those nice stories they used to have where everyone got along ? Jeanette MacDonald and all that lot ? WHEELER ( suddenly professorial ) Very simple . No wars . No major war , that is . No big , major world war . No focus . That 's what a big , major world war does . It brings a focus to the people . They take sides . Us against them . Simple as that . Now there 's no war . No big , major world war . Just gook wars . Jungle wars . Espionage wars . Secret little creepy wars in the swamp . So . No war , no focus . No focus , no structure . No structure spells disaster . And disaster is our business . Simple . MISS SCOONS Thank you , sir . ( goes back to scrubbing ) WHEELER You 're a very intelligent woman , Miss Scoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to talk to you at length sometime , but you can see I 'm wrapped up at the moment . MISS SCOONS Oh , certainly , sir , I was just curious . p. 58 WHEELER No harm in that . Curiosity breeds invention . That 's what we 're all here for . To invent ! It 's incredible . We 're here to invent and there 's no invention . Just a dust bowl . What 's going on ! We 've never spent this much time on a project before ! It 's been going on for years now . LANX We 're not sure of our position , sir . WHEELER Our position is to coldly calculate the public mind ! MISS SCOONS Is there such a thing , sir ? WHEELER Of course there is , Miss Scoons ! Do n't be silly . We have to find that part of our own mind which corresponds to the masses . We 're immune and contaminated at the same time . MISS SCOONS A public mind ? WHEELER Of course ! That 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , what we are is mind readers . Is n't that right , Mr. Brown ? RABBIT I do n't know . WHEELER I do n't like your attitude ! Lanx , why has Miss Scoons been demoted to scrubbing the floors and this idiot is dancing around making magic circles on the floor ? LANX ( stops boxing ) Well , she was going off the deep end , Mr. Wheeler . We had to do something . p. 59 WHEELER KEEP BOXING ! ( LANX starts up again . TYMPANI begins to speak as though in a world of his own , still cooking , facing audience . ) TYMPANI " What dya ' say we take in a movie ? " What a great sound that has . " What dya ' say we go out and take in a movie ? What dya ' say we get the hell outa ' here and go take in a movie ? ( he pauses , thinks of another way to say it ) How ' bout let 's just drop everything and go to the picture show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , just you and me , we leave the kids , get outa ' the house , into the old Studebaker , leave our miserable lives behind , and join the great adventure of a motion picture ? ( pause ; very simply this time ) What dya ' say we just lose ourselves forever in the miracle of film ? We nestle down , just the two of us , with a big box of buttered popcorn , a big cup of Seven-Up , a big box of Milk Duds , a giant box of Black Crows , and we just chew ourselves straight into oblivion ? " ( Pause as WHEELER seems to have dreamed off into TYMPANI 'S words . TYMPANI goes back to cooking . RABBIT interrupts the pause . ) RABBIT I 'd like to explain this thing to you if you do n't mind , Mr. Wheeler . WHEELER ( snapping out of dream ) DO N'T EXPLAIN IT ! MAKE IT WORK ! p. 60 RABBIT Well , it 's kind of complicated . I mean I 'm just a novice at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast company ! There 's no one I can talk to here ! That 's the trouble . No one ! Everyone 's off in their own little world . There 's no concern for the industry ! RABBIT I was trying to resolve the problem from a spiritual angle . WHEELER ( standing again ) WHAT PROBLEM ! WHAT SPIRIT ! FOR GOD 'S SAKE , IS N'T ANYONE GOING TO TELL ME WHAT 'S HAPPENED HERE ? DO N'T YOU THINK I 'VE NOTICED ? TYMPANI ( still cooking over drums ) I can tell you exactly . WHEELER Who 's that talking ? TYMPANI It 's me . WHEELER ( sitting back down ) Oh . TYMPANI We 've been locked out of time , and that 's all there is to it . WHEELER What kind of a statement is that ! LANX ( still boxing ) Could I stop for a second , Mr. Wheeler ? I can explain this whole thing . WHEELER NO ! YOU KEEP BOXING ! There 's nothing worse than a lazy boxer . Good men put their money behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ! I 'm sick of it ! p. 61 RABBIT I just wanted to give you some background on the wheel . That 's all . WHEELER Well , get on with it then ! RABBIT Yessir . Now , if you 'll notice , there 's four main bundles in the wheel . One for each point on the compass . To the North is wisdom , and its medicine animal is the buffalo . The color of the North is white . WHEELER I hope this is n't going to take too long . I might die any second , you know . TYMPANI What 's happened is that we 're locked into the narrowest part of our dream machine . WHEELER WHO 'S THAT TALKING OUT LOUD ! SHUT HIM UP ! TYMPANI I was on the verge of discovery . Things were opening up . I could actually see an opening . A rhythm . A whole new pattern . ( LANX boxes his way over to TYMPANI and punches him in the stomach . TYMPANI doubles over , but continues cooking from this position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) WHEELER ( to RABBIT ) You 'll have to excuse me . Go on . RABBIT The South is the sign of the mouse , and its medicine color is green . The South is the place of innocence and trust . p. 62 WHEELER Amazing ! The Indians dreamed this up ? RABBIT In the West is the sign of the bear . The West is the " Looks-Within " place , and its color is black  --  WHEELER Hold it ! What 's that mean ? " Looks-Within " place ? What does that mean ? RABBIT Uh  --  I guess it means the place for looking inside yourself ? It 's a very dangerous medicine bundle . In fact it 's the only authentic bundle I 've got . The rest are imitations . WHEELER What 's so dangerous about it ? RABBIT There 's a warning written on the outside of it saying that if it 's ever opened a terrible force will be let loose in the world . WHEELER What terrible force ? What kind of baloney is that ! Go on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The East is the sign of the eagle . This is the place of illumination , where we can see things clearly far and wide . Its color is gold . WHEELER Very nice . Now , how does it work ? RABBIT I do n't know . WHEELER ( standing ) WHAT ! RABBIT That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . This is an ancient design . How am I supposed to know . I 'm a white man . It took thousands of years to cook this up . I 'm just explaining the structure . p. 63 TYMPANI ( still in crouch from LANX 'S blow ) Two over easy with bacon ! LANX ( stops boxing and crosses to TYMPANI ) Right . ( TYMPANI serves LANX the imaginary food , holding his own stomach in pain . LANX sits on the floor and eats it . The rest continue . ) WHEELER ANCIENT ! I 'm ancient ! We 're all ancient ! What 's ancient got to do with it ! RABBIT I 'm exhausted . I ca n't keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window for a while . Maybe something will come to me . Something 's got to come sooner or later . ( RABBIT crosses slowly upstage and stares out the rectangle . WHEELER watches him for a second . ) WHEELER There 's something deadly going on here ! I can smell it . It 's the smell of my own skin ! You 've all given up on me , have n't you ? That 's what it is ! That 's exactly what it is . Your situation is n't quite so urgent as mine , so you 've given up and left me to the dogs . Left me here to rot in my juices ! Well , I can tell you one thing ! Without leadership you 're as good as gone . I know this city inside out ! There 's nowhere you can go without me ! Nowhere ! MISS SCOONS ( still scrubbing ) I have n't given up on you , sir . I still think you 're a smashing gov'nor. p. 64 WHEELER My office used to be swarming with talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( looking out rectangle ) You ca n't see a thing out here . It 's all yellow . WHEELER It was a gamble right from the start . I gambled on imagination and lost . My dream was to create an industry of imagination ! Now look at it ! Poisoned ! Putrified ! TYMPANI ( still doubled over ) Would you like some breakfast , sir ? WHEELER Yes I would . I would like that . That would make things better even though things have never been worse . TYMPANI What would you like ? WHEELER Ham and eggs with the yolks hard . I 'll die with the yolk in my chest . TYMPANI Right . ( starts cooking ) RABBIT You 're expecting too much . WHEELER I 'm expecting to survive ! That 's all . To live ! To be alive ! To stay in my skin ! RABBIT But you have n't even told me who the other characters are , what the story is , or anything . How am I supposed to do anything without information ? Even a second-rate hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 WHEELER That 's top secret ! RABBIT Great . WHEELER I can see now that I 've been abandoned . I should 've known . RABBIT What is it that 's eating you anyway ? I mean what is this skin condition that you 've developed ? WHEELER Do n't press me , Brown . You 're on thin ice . RABBIT I mean you 've got all of us turning ourselves inside out for you , but nobody really knows what it is you 're suffering from . WHEELER That 's my business ! RABBIT It 's no business ! It 's a disease ! WHEELER So what ! Something 's eating me , and that 's all that counts ! RABBIT You 're the disaster , Wheeler . You do n't have to look any further . You 're it ! WHEELER You 're in no position to be putting the finger on me ! I 'm the cause for your being here . It turns out you 're worthless anyway . All you 've brought is a bag of cheap Indian tricks ! And only one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even is a movie . That 's it , is n't it ? You do n't even have a scrap of footage . WHEELER Do n't be ridiculous ! p. 66 LANX I could fix up a cement bathing suit for him real easy , boss . WHEELER SHUT UP ! RABBIT There is no movie ! All you 've got is a disaster ! WHEELER I HAVE A MILLION MOVIES ! AND DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ! THEY 'RE IN MY BLOOD ! THEY 'RE CHURNING AROUND IN MY BLOOD ! THEY 'RE INSIDE THERE WITHOUT ANY FORM OR REASON AND THEY CA N'T GET OUT ! EVERY ONE OF THEM IS TEARING ME APART ! CHEWING AT THE WALLS ! TRYING TO ESCAPE ! TRYING TO BECOME SOMETHING ! TRYING TO OOZE OUT AND TAKE ON A SHAPE THAT WE ALL CAN SEE ! AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS EATING ME ! CHEWING ME APART FROM THE INSIDE OUT ! A MILLION DEVILS ! MOVIES TO MAKE YOUR HEAD SWIM ! DO N'T TALK TO ME ABOUT MOVIES ! ( WHEELER starts to shake and tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She escorts him to the swivel chair , where he collapses . ) MISS SCOONS Mr. Wheeler , sir ! You should n't get so wrought up ! It 's only a movie , for pity sake ! You must n't tax yourself so . You just relax now . ( She loosens his collar . WHEELER gasps for air . ) TYMPANI Ham and eggs with the yolks hard ! MISS SCOONS ( to TYMPANI ) Not now , you bleeding twit ! p. 67 TYMPANI But that 's what he ordered . MISS SCOONS Ca n't you see he 's about to expire , then ? TYMPANI Well , what am I going to do with this order ? He 's got ta ' pay for it . I ca n't cook and cook and cook and never get anything in return . WHEELER I 'll pay for it . I 'll pay for everything . All the damages . MISS SCOONS Try not to talk , sir . LANX ( to MISS SCOONS ) Let him die . What do you care ? WHEELER ( gasping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all there is to it . LANX ( pause , standing ) Are you crazy ? WHEELER There 's no other way around it . He 's got to know what the material is before it 's too late . LANX What if he 's spying for another studio ? It 's too big a risk . WHEELER We 'll have to take the chance . LANX Listen , my whole future 's wrapped up in this . You may die tomorrow , and I 'll be left holding the bag . WHEELER Makes no difference . Go and load the projectors ! p. 68 LANX You ca n't order me around ! You 're half dead . WHEELER ( WHEELER leaps at LANX like a crazed animal ) GO AND LOAD THE PROJECTORS ! ! ( LANX runs off stage-left . WHEELER is foaming at the mouth and snarling at the others . ) WHEELER ALL OF YOU ! GET OUT ! ( The rest start to run for cover . He stops RABBIT in his tracks . ) WHEELER NOT YOU ! ( Everyone has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stare at each other . WHEELER breathing heavily and swaying from side to side . RABBIT cringes to one side . Through this next section the stage lights slowly dim as the rectangle is lit . The scrim turns pale green . Slowly WHEELER stalks RABBIT around the stage ; his breathing becomes more and more desperate and seems to control the tempo of the scene . RABBIT tries to keep his distance as best he can . ) WHEELER ( wheezing in half whisper ) What 's that black place called again ? RABBIT What ? WHEELER The black place ? That place on your circle ? The dangerous bundle ? p. 69 RABBIT Oh , that . WHEELER The bear ? RABBIT The West . WHEELER That 's right . The West . That 's where we are , is n't it ? The West ? This is the West ? We ca n't get any further West than this . RABBIT This ? WHEELER What 's it called again ? RABBIT What ? WHEELER ( suddenly unleashing ) WHAT 'S THE WEST CALLED ! ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks-Within " place . WHEELER That 's right . " Looks-Within . " RABBIT I did n't understand you at first . WHEELER Of course not . That 's because you 're full of fear . RABBIT What ? WHEELER FEAR ! ! YOU 'RE FULL OF FEAR ! YOU 'RE FACING ME AND YOU DO N'T KNOW WHAT I AM ! RABBIT No . WHEELER You do n't know what 's coming next . RABBIT No . WHEELER That 's right . And you 're wondering . p. 70 RABBIT Yes . WHEELER And your wondering leads you to imagine the worst . RABBIT No . WHEELER " NO " WO N'T HELP ! RABBIT NO ! WHEELER Because now , at any moment , what you most fear might actually happen . It might actually crawl out of the walls , and appear . RABBIT You do n't know what I fear . WHEELER There you go again , dreaming you 're different . Setting yourself apart . RABBIT You ca n't be inside of me ! WHEELER WE 'RE THE SAME ! RABBIT NO ! WHEELER WHAT WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RABBIT You 're crazy , Wheeler ! You 're a raving maniac ! WHEELER And you ? RABBIT What about me ? WHEELER What are you ? RABBIT AN ARTIST ! ( WHEELER starts laughing maniacally , doubling himself over . ) RABBIT YOU 'RE THE PRODUCER , AND I 'M THE ARTIST ! ( WHEELER laughs harder. ) p. 71 RABBIT YOU CALLED ME DOWN HERE ! I 'M IN DEMAND ! YOU 'RE A DIME A DOZEN ! ( WHEELER stops himself abruptly . ) WHEELER That 's true . A dime a dozen . RABBIT You do n't know a thing about creation . WHEELER I was created without my knowing . Same as you . Creation 's a disease . RABBIT What are you talking about ? WHEELER We 're dying here . Right now . In front of each other . RABBIT Just stay away from me , Wheeler ! WHEELER I was turned into this beyond my knowing . I was spawned somehow by a city . I was leaked out . An Angel in disguise . RABBIT You 're nothing ! WHEELER I 'M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! RABBIT What what means ? WHEELER The West . RABBIT It 's just a place . WHEELER It 's a place of discovery . Things are uncovered here . Gold ! Oceans ! LOOK INSIDE OF ME ! RABBIT That 's all been discovered . p. 72 WHEELER Only the surface . We 're cracking the surface , Brown . We 're going into a deep black bear . We 're taking the plunge . We 're penetrating the flesh and bone . RABBIT Get off it , Wheeler . This is a corporation . You 're an executive . WHEELER We 're going straight through all the paraphernalia . All the ponytails , all the jargon , all the Indian lore , all the magic mumbo jumbo . Deeper than California ! We 're going down , Brown ! We 're coming face to face with something deadly . RABBIT Not me . WHEELER You ca n't get out of it ! RABBIT I 'M NOT IN IT ! WHEELER What was the sign for the East again ? RABBIT I 'm not playing , Wheeler ! WHEELER " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and wide . The place of the eagle . " RABBIT So what ! WHEELER Where 's your faith , Rabbit ? I thought you prayed regularly ? What happened to your missions ? Your sense of mission ? Your hero ? RABBIT That 's got nothing to do with it . You 're twisting things up . WHEELER Things are twisted ! Monsters are being hatched by the dozens and turned into saints ! We can do anything here ! Anything is possible here ! We can recreate the world and make you swallow it whole ! We can make a nightmare out of a molehill ! We can tear you to shreds and make you like it . p. 73 RABBIT You ca n't mix real life with the movies ! ( WHEELER goes into convulsive laughter and starts to have a slight seizure . ) WHEELER THE MOVIES ! THIS IS THE MOVIES ! ! RABBIT ( suddenly covering his head as though afraid to be photographed ) No camera ! No camera ! ( WHEELER chases him , miming a movie camera , trying to photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were a primitive child ) You do n't understand . It wo n't hurt you . It 's just a machine . All it does is capture light in a certain pattern . It shows you moving . RABBIT ( running away ) No ! No camera ! No capture ! WHEELER Do n't be silly . It 's fun . Look . I 'll do it on myself . Look ! ( he turns imaginary camera on himself ) See ? No pain . It 's fun . RABBIT It 's Devil ! WHEELER It 's not . It 's beautiful . It makes us see ourselves . It brings things back to life . It makes us happy . RABBIT No happy ! WHEELER Happy ! Everybody loves pictures . It 's just like magic . Look , I 'll show you . ( WHEELER goes to swivel chair and pulls it down left for RABBIT . RABBIT runs. ) p. 74 RABBIT No capture ! No light ! WHEELER No . I 'll show you the footage . You 'll love it . You 're the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's top-secret footage . Absolutely private . RABBIT No secret ! Devil ! WHEELER ( trying to coax RABBIT into swivel chair ) But we 'd love to get your reactions to it . It 's so nerve-racking editing a film . Everyone giving you criticism and opinions , but someone like you would give a raw , gut-level reaction which could prove invaluable to us . RABBIT ( settling down a little ) No light . WHEELER ( escorting him to chair and sitting him down ) Please . Just as a favor . I promise that no one will photograph you . Just sit down and enjoy yourself . Relax . Everything 's beautiful . Everything 's going to be just fine . The lights will slowly fade . ( lights follow to dark ) The crowd will grow silent . The screen will light up with beautiful colors. ( scrim turns red slowly ) Your body will go limp and your mind will drift off into a wonderful world of adventure . ( RABBIT is seated downstage in swivel chair facing rectangle upstage , his back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 WHEELER Now just try to relax and watch the movie like a good boy . ( Sudden crash of cymbals , bells , and pulsing percussion offstage . SAX PLAYER enters down-right corner playing low , lurking melody . He faces upstage to platform . TYMPANI enters down left and accompanies on drums . He stands on downstage side of drums facing up to platform . He could bring on another percussion instrument too . WHEELER pulls out a long black flashlight and clicks it on in the dark . The only lights now are the neon rectangle , backlighting on scrim , and WHEELER 's flashlight . WHEELER begins to narrate , using the flashlight like a schoolmaster 's stick . RABBIT stays seated and unseen . ) WHEELER ( amplified , documentary voice ) Our story opens with the city in a state of siege . A deadlock between two powers so intent upon destroying each other that even the vanishing of their own existence in that struggle means nothing to them . They would sooner die than attempt to coexist . ( LANX and MISS SCOONS enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered from head to foot in very long , silken robes with Oriental designs in bright colors , intricately woven dragons on their chests and backs . The robes cover their heads , which seem to be extended somewhat . Around their waists are wide black sashes with long tassels , and several long black sticks about the size of broom handles are held in by the sashes . They are both barefoot . Their shoulders are huge under the robes . In general they give the impression of menacing Samurai warriors. ) p. 76 WHEELER By this time the city has long been in the hands of roving bands of outlaw-warriors . At one time content to work under the shackles of the Lords and Bosses , one after the other they have broken away and taken the law into their own hands , preferring the America of their distant frontier past . ( The two warrior figures inch their way slowly forward toward each other , walking on the balls of their feet and releasing low guttural noises from inside the robes . When they reach a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move into a crouched position , knees bending slowly , keeping their backs straight , and come down so that they 're sitting on their heels with their hands resting on their thighs . They face each other in this position for a while . Their sounds continue as WHEELER shines the flashlight on them and goes on with his narration . ) WHEELER The siege , however , has become so bloody and so awesome that even the head chieftains of these two deadly powers have agreed to meet in a remote area of the city to see if they can come to some understanding of the future of their predicament . There has never been a summit conference of this kind as long as can be remembered . Every battle in their recorded history was fought to the bitter end out of their strange sense of honor . Even suicides are a thing of the past . ( Drums and sax fill slowly as the two chiefs slowly withdraw the sticks from their belts and hold them in front of each other at eye level . This should seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 77 WHEELER The meeting goes on in silence with the city burning brightly in the distance . There is no talk of peace . Peace would only serve to wipe them out slowly . Their only concern is how to come to a speedy annihilation . They agree to leave their future in the hands of their two generals and to retire themselves to a deep system of caves where they will enact their final duel in solitude . ( Slowly the two chieftains rise and take off their long robes , revealing the generals underneath . The robes fall to the ground . Underneath they are dressed in red crash helmets with long black visors covering their faces . They each wear heavy football shoulder pads without shirts , kidney pads tied to their waists , and padded football pants . They have elbow pads and white tape around their wrists . They slowly bend down and pick up a stick from the floor . They square off to each other like Samurai warriors . ) WHEELER The generals see each other eye to eye . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no way out for them . Their roles are well defined . Their armies are in position . There 's nothing holding back . ( The generals suddenly come crashing down on each other with the sticks . Loud clang of percussion , sax , and high shrieking voices of LANX and MISS SCOONS ! They back off and again face each other with the sticks . They charge again . High screams , crash of sticks . Percussion , sax , then back to attack positions . Each return to this position after an attack is marked by stillness and concentration . Music softens. ) p. 78 WHEELER The battle lasted days , with the armies agreeing finally to become the audience to their two generals . They watched the sun rise and fall on them with neither one growing any weaker than the other . Gambling grew so rampant between the two armies that soon there grew a bond between them so strong that they were joined together as one vast army . But the generals went on . ( Crash of generals again . Percussion , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again they crashed into each other with the heavy swords . The cold steel flashed across the City of Angels and cut the stillness of the ruins . No bird sang , no dog barked , no man moved . ( LANX and MISS SCOONS continue with their parries and attacks throughout , with the musical accompaniment along with their voices . WHEELER continues , sweeping the scene with his flashlight . ) WHEELER The mood of the armies changed from camaraderie to one of fear , for they could all sense the impending doom of this last battle . The generals were exactly matched in strength , endurance , and intelligence . In fact they were so exactly the same in every respect that one could n't be told from the other . The only possible outcome was death to them both . On and on they fought into the night until slowly the armies began to thin out and wander away into the desert . Finally the generals were left all alone . Their sounds were lonely and distant like two wild bucks on an empty prairie . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and gone without them knowing . They were battling into another time . They were crossing continents as they fought . They were passing history by . ( The clashes between the generals go on with the accompanied sax and percussion . Voices from LANX and MISS SCOONS . They continue to reposition and attack . The stage is very dark still , except for the glowing rectangle . The scrim has faded to a pale red in the background. ) p. 79 WHEELER As far as they knew , they were the only living things . The moon raced across the sky . The planets howled in space . Their primitive weapons performed a conversation in empty space . ( Battle goes on . Music rises and falls . ) WHEELER Finally , after days of constant combat , one of the generals revealed himself as a woman . ( MISS SCOONS takes off her helmet and visor and sets it on the floor . LANX freezes and stares at her , still keeping his helmet on . Music stops . ) WHEELER In that moment , the opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her weapon home . ( MISS SCOONS lets out a shattering scream and plunges her stick inside the upstage arm of LANX , who drops his stick with a groan . He stands there facing her . She keeps hold of the stick without pulling it out of him . ) WHEELER At last the generals saw their situation . They were one being with two opposing parts . Everything was clear to them . At last they were connected . In that split second they gained and lost their entire lives . ( Very slowly LANX begins to pull himself along the stick toward MISS SCOONS , impaling himself more and more with each step . She holds her ground and waits for him . The saxophone and drums enter in here and gather force . LANX finally reaches her . They embrace and stand there in each other 's arms . Music reaches a peak , then suddenly stops . Stage lights bang up to bright yellow . MISS SCOONS and LANX release each other and drop right back into their old characters , as they were in Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on the platform . ( One of them could even go off and get them both some water and then come back on . ) This all should be very relaxed and as though they were two athletes just finishing an event . RABBIT is still hidden in the swivel chair . WHEELER talks to him as he strides nervously around the stage . TYMPANI and the SAX PLAYER leave the stage. ) p. 80 WHEELER ( to RABBIT ) So , what do you think ? RABBIT ( unseen ) Terrible . Corniest stuff I ever saw . WHEELER ( pounding the flashlight with his fist and striding angrily ) What 's wrong with it ! WHAT THE HELL 'S WRONG WITH IT ! RABBIT ( still unseen ) Everything . WHEELER What do you mean ! It 's got a story , a plot , good meaty characters , tremendous language , colorful locations . It has motion , adventure , conflict , excitement , rhythm , poetry . It 's got everything ! ( Suddenly RABBIT whips the swivel chair around so it 's facing WHEELER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fangs , long black fingernails , and a long , thick mane of black hair . He remains seated . WHEELER is the only one who notices the change in RABBIT 's appearance . LANX and MISS SCOONS remain indifferent . MISS SCOONS starts massaging LANX 'S shoulders as they sit on the platform upstage . ) RABBIT There 's no disaster ! We 're not interested in hanky-panky love stories , romantically depicting the end of the world . We 're after hard-core disaster . I thought you understood that . p. 81 WHEELER ( moving backwards slightly ) Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! ( WHEELER looks for reassurance to LANX and MISS SCOONS but they only smile back at him . ) RABBIT ( rising out of chair ) No , you wait a minute , mister . WHEELER Do n't come any closer ! I 'm not well ! I 'm not supposed to have any severe shocks ! I might have a heart attack ! ( turning to LANX , who ignores him ) LANX , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ! I 'M BEING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even see you . WHEELER What do you mean ! Of course they can see me ! I can see them ! They smiled at me before ! RABBIT You 're in trouble , mister . WHEELER I 'M NOT IN TROUBLE ! HOW COULD I BE IN TROUBLE ! I 'M PROTECTED HERE ! RABBIT What 'd you think , you could come down here in your provincial gear and pull the wool over our eyes ? We 've had experience , ya ' know . WHEELER WAIT A MINUTE ! I 'M NOT YOU , GODDAMMIT ! I 'M ME ! RABBIT You might as well burn that footage up and go back to making campfires . You 're washed up in this town , buddy . p. 82 WHEELER I 'M ESTABLISHED ! I 'M FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ! I 'm in the business . I 'm in pictures . I plant pictures in people 's heads . I plant them and they grow . They grow more pictures . And the pictures grow like wildfire . People see them in front of their eyes . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're making love . Wherever they go I go with them . I spread their disease . I 'm that powerful . RABBIT Look , if you do n't mind , I 've got several appointments , and you 're burning my time . WHEELER LANX ! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ! ( LANX and MISS SCOONS are now sitting on the edge of the platform , swinging their legs back and forth and eating imaginary popcorn as they watch RABBIT and WHEELER like two teenagers watching a movie . LANX makes no acknowledgment of WHEELER 'S presence other than that he 's an image on a movie screen . ) RABBIT We 've arranged your bus fare back to wherever it is you came from . WHEELER LANX ! WHAT 'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ! RABBIT You 're on the silver screen , buddy . You 've been captured in celluloid and you 'll never get out . All they 're looking at is a moving picture show . WHEELER I 'M A PERSON ! THEY CAN SEE ME ! THEY KNOW WHO I AM ! MISS SCOONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MISS SCOONS ! LOOK AT ME ! LOOK AT ME ! I 'M OVER HERE ! ( WHEELER starts waving frantically at MISS SCOONS and LANX but they only smile and chew their popcorn. ) p. 83 RABBIT You better get outa ' here before you disintegrate right here on the spot . WHEELER ( turning on RABBIT ) I wo n't disintegrate ! I 'M IMMORTAL ! I 'LL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED ! Right now there 's people watching ! Right this very minute ! There 's people all around me ! Watching and remembering ! As long as they 're watching I 'll be remembered ! RABBIT You 're dead , Wheeler . You 're dead and gone . ( WHEELER stops and stares at RABBIT . Pause . He turns and stares at LANX and MISS SCOONS still eating their popcorn . He turns and looks at the audience . He turns back to RABBIT . ) WHEELER ( to RABBIT ) I 'll show you who 's dead . ( WHEELER crosses slowly to the medicine bundle depicting the West and picks it up . RABBIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the bundle out in front of him . ) RABBIT Ah , back to your old tricks , huh ? What do you think that 's going to do ? ( WHEELER crosses to RABBIT slowly , holding out the bundle . ) WHEELER ( quietly to himself ) It 's going to open up the world . It 's going to get me out of here . It 's going to reveal something . It 's going to change everything from the way it is now to something else . p. 84 RABBIT Ca n't you stand the way it is ? WHEELER Can you ? RABBIT Well , go ahead then . See what happens . WHEELER Would you hold my hand while I do it ? RABBIT Well , how 're you going to open it up then ? WHEELER I never thought of that . RABBIT You want me to do it ? WHEELER No . RABBIT You want me to help you ? WHEELER No . RABBIT Well , go ahead then . WHEELER ( pauses , staring at bundle ) What if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . WHEELER No . I guess not . ( WHEELER slowly unties the bundle . As the bundle opens up , a slow , steady stream of green liquid , the color of their faces , oozes from it onto the stage . RABBIT and WHEELER watch it as they stand there . LANX and MISS SCOONS are still watching them , as though in the movies . They speak as the lights are slowly dimming . RABBIT and WHEELER remain still while the liquid drips. ) p. 85 MISS SCOONS ( to LANX ) I 'm not supposed to stay for the second one , ya ' know , Jimmy . LANX Yeah , yeah . MISS SCOONS Well , I 'm not . I 'm supposed to be back before eleven . LANX I just wan na ' stay for the titles . MISS SCOONS Last time you said that we never got back until three in the morning . LANX That was last time . MISS SCOONS I almost got sent to Juvie . I do n't wan na ' get sent to Juvie again . LANX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na get sent to Juvie , for Christ 's sake . I just wan na ' see the titles . MISS SCOONS Why , do you know somebody in this movie or somethin ' ? LANX Just shut up , will ya ' .
