The National Graphical ' Association , the printers ' union , claimed it would bear the brunt of any loss Of jobs . Wildcat strikes were called . With these strikes and ' other labor disputes in 1978 , the Times lost 12 million copies during the year and revenue worth orth an estimated $4 million .

Newspaper sellers in Britain report many Times readers have not ordered a replacement paper . The three other quality morning papers ? the Telegraph , the Guardian , and the Financial Times ? have n't picked up many new readers .
