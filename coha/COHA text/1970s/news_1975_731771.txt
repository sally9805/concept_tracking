txt Four days before Gregg Sanders , a 15-year-old boy from Mountainside , N.J. , killed his parents with an ax and then threw himself to his death from a water tower , he was reprimanded by his history teacher . He was worried about it . The teacher had threatened the boy with a demerit because he had been talking in class , which meant that a letter would be sent home to Gregg 's parents . That had never happened before . In fact , the tall , good-looking sophomore had been regarded as something of a model student . He had earned good grades , but he was not seen by his classmates as an overly aggressive striver . Instead , they saw him as a humorous boy who joked and teased good-naturedly and who enjoyed sports . His teachers liked him too and his neighbors thought him thoughtful and courteous . Another Picture And yet in dozens of interviews with his friends , his teachers , his physician and law - enforcement officials that were conducted after the suicide-murders , another picture of Gregg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret aspirations who sought solace in a secret room and in secret dreams . On Monday , Jan. 13 . Gregg mentioned his classroom repGregg Sanders rimand to one of his six close friends , a boy whose parents would not permit his name to be published . He told the boy he had three options . " I can beat up the teacher , I can intercept the letter , or I can kill myself , " his friend remembered him saying . He also recalled that Gregg had rejected the idea of fighting the teacher , saying he knew the man had once been a boxer . The threat of a demerit had not been it serious one and the teacher did not even report Gregg 's infraction to Allan Inglesby , the assistant headmaster of the competitive and prestigious Pingry School in Hillside . On Tuesday , Gregg , appearing composed , arrived at the private high school . An English theme he wrote , which dealt with an imaginary conversation between Jesus and God , was read in class as an example of excellent writing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durthe last period of the day he chatted with his friend Billy Corbett . They discussed what courses they would choose next year . Gregg mentioned to Billy that he felt he was being singled out unjustly for criticism by his history teacher because four other boys also had been talking in class , Table Is Set At 5:45 he boarded the bus that would take him home to the large white house on Sunnyslope Drive with the swimming pool and cabana in the back . He ate dinner with his father , Thomas Sanders Jr. , a 48-year-old vice president of the First National City Bank of New York , and his mother , Janice , 44 , a teacher in a church day-care center . Someone did the dishes and set the table for the next day 's breakfast . Then , at what the stale medical examiner thinks was about 9:30 , Gregg took up a two-foot ax and killed his father with several blows to the head and then killed his mother the same way . There was no sign of struggle . His father had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck from behind . His mother , dressed in nightclothes , was murdered in the dining room . A few minutes later a neighbor saw the boy , dressed only in khaki pants and a light shirt in the 15-degree weather , walking up a path behind his house to the 150-foot-high water tower on a hill in the Watchung Reservation that overlooks the town . Two hours later the Union County Park Police found his body at the base of the tower . He had slashed his left wrist before he jumped . When the police came to the Sanders 's $70,000 splitlevel home they found the bodies of the bank executive and his wife . They also found a note left by the boy on the desk in his bedroom , under a paperweight and lighted by a desk lamp . It said : " To whom it may concern : I am sorry for the trouble I have caused . I 'm not in any way mad at my parents . I just ca n't take it any more . Well , I just wanted to say l'tn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and the school were shocked . The family 's minister , the Rev. Elmer Talcott of the Community Presbyterian Church , groped for some understanding . In preThomas Sanders Jr . was 48-year-old vice president at the First National City Bank of New York . paring the memorial service for the family he turned to the writings of Dostoyevsky and William Blake . At school the administrators said they had seen no sign . Gregg was never a problem . He had been a good student , with an I.Q. of between 119 and 130 . The boy 's 19-year old sister . Wendy , who had been working as a secretary in the Boston area , also sought clues . Acted ' Out of Love ' In a letter written to the Mountainside Police Department , she concluded that Gregg had killed his parents out of love for them , to spare them the sorrow of living with his suicide . In her letter she wrote : " For reasons that will never be known to me or to anyone , my brother could not cape with the pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? Thinking of your own trying problems at that age might provide a partial answer . Gregg was an extremely sensitive and loving boy , so perhaps the usual pressures hit him harder than most children his age . " Some , but by no means all , of those pressures have surfaced in the interviews . Perhaps the most revealing chscox ery was the existence of Gregg 's secret room . an alcove of privacy in which he nurtured his fantasies and his secret life . The sanctuary was a tenfoot-long narrow crawl space in the attic of a porch . The peaked four-foot-high room adjoined Gregg 's upper-floor bedroom and it was entered through an opening in the wall of his room . His desk stood against the opening and to enter the hidden room he had to crawl through the kneehole of the desk . In the attic space there was a mattress , a lamp , books , empty liquor bottles and canteens of water . There also were a number of Nazi emblems and insignia . A two-foot-high wooden panel , apparently made by Gregg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amerikanische Nazi Partei . " There were armbands with swastikas and a six-page hand-written manuscript of quotations from Adolf Hitler . None of Gregg 's friends , including one who had visited the room , knew of this interest . In fact , they remembcred him as being liberal in his political views . He had told them how he had argued with his father . a supporter of former President Richard M Nixon . They noted that the six boys in Gregg 's closely knit group of friends included two blacks and two Jews . Two of the boys were handicapped . ? Views on Hitler On Tuesday , the day Gregg killed his parents and himself , Paul Gleason , his German teacher , recalled that during class discussion he had asked Gregg what he had been doing the night before . " I read Shirer 's ' The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , ' " the boy answered . " It was the fifth time . " The teacher asked whether Gregg meant it was the fifth time he had started the 1,245-page book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am reading it through , " Gregg replied . Mr. Gleason was intrigued . " Most students Gregg 's age have no knowledge of the Nazi period , " the teacher said . " I asked him what he thought of Hitler . " Mr. Gleason recalled that Gregg thought a while and then replied , " He was a genius ; unfortunately he was insane . " The teacher asked him about Hermann Goering and the boy replied that in his estimation , Goering , too , had been brilliant . In response to another question , he said he did not like Heinrich Himmler because " he was a sadist . " Billy Corbett had been in the secret room on one occasion . Billy , who served with Gregg as co-managers of the junior varsity football team at Pingry , would visit with Gregg on weekends . Last summer Gregg spent a long weekend at the Corbett 's seashore cottage . Gregg had once dated Billy 's 14-year-old sister Maggie . Billy said he never saw the Nazi materials in the hideaway . But he knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me that when he was five years old , his father came into the room and that that made him so angry that he did n't speak to The 150-foot water tower in the Watchung Reservation where Gregg Sanders plunged to his death . his father for three weeks , " Billy said . Billy said Gregg had told him that the room was cornpletly private and that lie had smoked marijuana there . He said that in November and December Gregg boasted that he was getting high three and four times a week in the room . Another close friend . who has since moved to Texas ( and whose father also asked that his son 's name not he published ) , said he , too , had never heard of the Nazi interest . " Gregg just told me he had this absolutely safe room and I could stash things there if I wanted , " he said . Anxiety Is Revealed He had been writing to Gregg , he said , and the last letter he received from him was mailed on Dec. 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were not Yale material , " but he seemed happy enough and enclosed a long poem , a parody on the " Twelve Days of Christmas . " The last refrain said : " On the tenth day of Christmas my dealer gave to me , 10 hits of acid , 9 snorts of horse , 8 hits of orange sunshine , 7 uppers upping , 6 downers downing , 5 hits of THC , 4 grains of hash , .3 snorts of coke , 2 caps of speed and an ounce of Colombian weed . " The recipient of the letter , as " well as Gregg 's other friends , believe that the sentiments were adolescent bravura ; they are certain that Gregg had never used anything more than marijuana . A toxicological examination conducted after the autopsy showed no signs of narcotics in the boy 's body . But Gregg 's friends all think there was a more revealing clue in that letter ? his anxiety about grades . Gregg had told the boy in Texas that until last year his parents had always been comparing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her highschool class and who was an accomplished musician . The boy in Texas said that Gregg would frequently complain that his grades were not as good as they should he . As a result , he said , he was surprised that after Gregg 's death the school reported he had been an honor student who was 22d in his class of 100 . " To hear him talk , you 'd think he was on the borderline of failing , " his friend remembered . Last year , Wendy Sanders did not return to Connecticut College after completing her freshman year there . The authorities said she did not give any reason , but her acquaintances said she had become disenchanted with school and had gone to work instead as a secretary in Boston . Once , Gregg told Maggie Corbett that his sister had run away fron home and stayed at a motel for three days while she was in high school . He said Wendy ran away after their parents had argued with her about her smoking cigarettes . He told Maggie that when his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running away like that , too . Parental Pressure Cited The Corbett children and Dr. Joseph A. Boylan , who had been the pediatrician for both the Sanders children , said they thought Gregg felt more parental pressure after his sister , with whom he had been very close , dropped out of college . " He told me her dropping out had hurt his parents , " Maggie said . But Gregg talked of serious things only rarely . Mostly he would joke with his friends . He had an enormous collection of knock-knock jokes and one liners . He read Mad magazine and The National Lampoon and lie was generally regarded as the funniest person in his circle of friends . However , on occasion he would he moody and somber . According to law-enforcement officials who conducted the investigation of the suicidemurders , Gregg once told a friend  --  a boy whose parents also asked that his name not he cited  --  just how he intended to kill himself . He said he would go to the unused water tower , in the Watchung wilderness reserve , mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-foot chain link fence at the top . As he hung by one hand over the edge , he would slash his wrist with a knife . He said he would not slash his wrist first because that might prevent him from climbing the fence . In addition , he also once told the same boy that shooting someone " was an impersonal way to kill . " Mass Murder Recalled On another occasion , when Gregg and this friend were both 11 , they . discussed the murders of the wife , mother and three teen-aged children of John List . which occurred in 1971 in Westfield , a town which abuts Mountainside . In that case , Mr. List , a 46-year - old accountant , had written a letter explaining that lie had shot his family to death to spare them sorrow and to save their souls . Mr. List 's eight-year-old Chevrolet was found at Newark Airport shortly after the murders . But the shy , bespectacled man has never been found . Gregg 's friend recalled that the case had frightened him . He told investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in fact , he had kept a file of all news stories about . the List murders . The police , however , did not find such a file in his room . But again and again in interviews the theme that kept recurring was Gregg 's apparent feeling that he had failed to attain expectations that may have been set for him by his parents , but that he probably also adopted as his own standards . One indication of this lies in the application his mother made for him two years ago to Pingry , the ** old day school in Hillside . In answer to a question about her son 's future plans , she wrote : - We hope that Gregg will want to go to college , but that whatever he does , he does happily and well . " Psychologists and school administrators said that this is a common response from liberal parents , but one that often carries with it undertones of the parents ' real wish for their child to succeed academically . Parents ' Visit Noted During Gregg 's first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock to 5:45 , Mr. and Mrs. Sanders , both graduates of Antioch , had one conference with Gregg 's adviser , George Christow , the school 's athletic director . Mr. Christow does not recall the conference , but his notes on it say : " Parents feet quite happy generally , but they still feel Gregg does not do too much work at home . He seems to be able to get good grades without exerting himself , but I know they feel that even better grades might be possible with more effort at home . I feel Gregg will do quite well here and that more pressure for better grades would not be appropriate . " Dr. Boylan , the pediatrician who treated Gregg since he was three years old , said there was nothing in his early childhood pointing to mental illness . Three years ago , however , Mrs. Sanders complained to Dr. Boylan that her son was having " dizzy spells " and " staring spells . " The complaints continued over an eight-month period and at the mother 's request The New York TImes/Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , 1972 . The test showed normal brain functioning and no sign of epilepsy . Dr. Boylan said he was sure Gregg was not schizophrenic . Dr. Boylan says that in retrospect the dizzy and staring episodes were almost certainly what psychiatrists call " conversion symptoms " ? soniatic manifestations of some inner anxiety . But the pediatrician and a number of other physicians consulted noted that such episodes are not uncommon in adolescence , a particularly turbulent period that ? some psychiatrists even refer to as " the normal period of psychosis . " Dr. Boylan described Mrs. Sanders as a rigid woman who did not reveal much about her family . He remarked that the last time he saw Gregg , in September of last year , his wife , a pediatric nurse , had asked Mrs. Sanders casually if she wanted to discuss any problems Gregg - might be having . The mother replied , somewhat abruptly , " We have no problems . " Other friends or the family described Mrs. Sanders as a socially conscious woman who worked at the church day-care center not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to squander her training as a teacher . They remembered her stoicism in going to work every day despite the pain of two pinched nerves and a neck injury received in an automobile accident a year ago . And they also talked of her devotion to Gregg and his apparent love and concern for her . Her husband was described as a man who had worked hard to achieve the American dream . He had been the son of a Philadelphia longshoreman and he had become the vice president of a major bank . He often brought his work home and Gregg would sometimes tell his friends how hard his father worked and how responsible his job was . And yet , ambivalently , he once wondered to Billy Corbett how strange it was that his father was small and unathletic while his grandfather was a brawny man who had battled with his fists on the waterfront . Argued with Father Wendy Sanders told investigators that on occasion her brother would rail and curse at their father , sometimes hitting the wall in rage . At 5 feet 9 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after such outbursts Gregg would have no memory of them . Despite the available clues , the death of Gregg Sanders and the murder of his parents remain enigmatic . Perhaps it is as the Rev. Talcott suggests , that the answers will come in fiction . Dr. Leon Eisenberg , a psychiatrist at Boston 's Children 's Hospital , said the case , in its rarity and impact , remind him of Raskolnikov , the tortured ax murderer of Dostoevsky 's " Crime and Punishment . " The psychiatrists who have been apprised of the case agree that the secret room , the feelings of pressure and the allure of Hitler signify something profound , but what it is they can not say . From the ? evidence at hand they can not even agree whether Gregg was insane or not . Dr. Eisenberg said that the injunction against parricide is , along with incest , the most fundamental in almost all societies and its violation connotes a grave disorder of the mind . Moreover , the link of suicide with parricide is extremely unusual . In New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was turned up in files going back ten years . Dr. Eisenberg speculated that Gregg might have been a paranoid schizophrenic and said that if he was , the condition must have existed for several months and perhaps a year . " What is apparent in a well-ordered paranoid is the ability to maintain secrecy , " he said . " On the other hand , the lack of a grandiose rationale for his act left in his suicide note militates against a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia . " In another attempt to understand the forces that led to the Sanders family tragedy , Dr. W. Hugh Missildine , professor of psychiatry at Ohio State University , speculated that Gregg could well have been tormented by a conflict between " his tremendous rebellion at the perfectionistic attitudes of his parents and a tremendous desire to please them . " " It sounds like he belittled himself a great deal and hid his conflict under a smooth facade , " Dr. Missildine said . " He might have thought he should have lived in Nazi days because he was really one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a power symbol . " Dr. Missildine suggested , as did other specialists , that it was common for teen-avers to express rebellion and to also belittle themselves . " Usually one of these feelings predominate , " he continued . " Sometimes they act out of rebellion and run away or take drugs . Sometimes they submerge the rebellion by deprecating themselves . " This boy seemed to keep both his rebellion and self belittlement under wraps in equal portions until it built up with great pressure and he could not cope with it anymore . " But as to what really happened and why , I suppose we will never know . " In this , the psychiatrist was echoing the bewilderment of the neighbors , classmates , teachers and friends of Gregg Sanders .
