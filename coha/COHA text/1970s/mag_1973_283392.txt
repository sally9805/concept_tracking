THE TOOTH MERCHANT <P> byC.L . SULZBERGER 275 pages . Quadrangle. $7.95 . <P> <P> Since World War II , New York Times Columnist C.L. Sulzberger has been prowling Europe 's corridors of power , acquiring a broad acquaintance with Poo-Bahs , potentates , foreign ministers and heads of state . Presented in daily print , the fruits of his labors have customarily shown more care than flare , and a neutral observer might have assumed that if Sulzberger ever got round to a novel , it would be one of those ponderous constructions that bore the reader while portentously trading on the author 's expertise . <P> Not so . In The Tooth Merchant , Sulzberger 's knowledge is very much in evidence , but so is a distinct sense of humor . He presents a slippery , multilingual Armenian named Kevork Sasounian , who discovers the original dragon 's teeth ( sacksful of them ) , which have been lying in a cave in Asia Minor since Cadmus ' and Jason 's time . What to do ? Why , sell them as potential shock troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950s . <P> Sales trips follow , with Sasounian sowing sample teeth and producing angry instant hoplites , to the delight or dismay of the likes of Stalin and Beria , Ben-Gurion , Nasser , SHAPE Commander General Alfred Gruenther in Paris , and Dwight David Eisenhower , who watches the demonstration on a quiet corner of the White House lawn . <P> Exactly who buys the dragon 's teeth or not , and why , should stay secret . It is fair to say , though , that Sulzberger offers a fine , new explanation for the moment and method of Joseph Stalin 's demise . Another of his best moments is a debate between General Gruenther ( a Catholic ) and Sasounian about whether or not it would be murder to dump the dragon 's teeth into the depths of the North Atlantic . <P> The author keeps these trips light and fantastic , poking fun at international spy novels as he goes , writing himself into the text ( Sasounian gives C.L. Sulzberger $4,000 to try to smuggle his mistress from Istanbul to Paris ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers within busy reach of a good dictionary . ( Samples : congener , metopic , eristic , flocculent , saporous . ) Sulzberger 's congeners will be pleased to find that The Tooth Merchant , though occasionally eristic , never stoops to flocculence . <P> - :Timothy Foote
