There were two worship services for the white Baptists of Plains , Ga. , last week . One group met as usual at the Plains Baptist Church , made famous in Jimmy Carter 's presidential race , while a group that has forsaken Plains Baptist gathered at a little-used Lutheran church five miles out of town . After Sunday-school classes on the lawn and in the woods , 30 dissidents heard Sumter County Agent Tim Lawson , their chief organizer , announce that the Rev. Fred Collins of nearby Camilla had agreed to be pastor of the fledgling Bottsford Baptist Mission . Collins , 34 , left Plains Baptist in frustration three years ago . <P> There was another important announcement . Hugh Carter , state senator and cousin of the President , came up to lead in prayer and declared that he had just resigned after 31 years as a deacon and 28 years as church clerk at Plains Baptist . The new mission would have his " complete dedication , " he said . Like other local families , the Carter clan is divided over what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the family church , and President Carter , who has officially transferred to a Washington church , is expected to attend Plains Baptist when he is in town . <P> After the service . Cousin Hugh spoke harshly about the people running Plains Baptist . He described them as " anti-Carter , anti-black and full of hate . " A woman who played piano for the Bottsford service was more benign . Said she : " I have no animosity toward anyone in the other church . I pray for them , and I pray for us . " <P> The divisions in the Plains Baptist Church became critical when black Preacher Clennon King challenged its whites-only membership policy late in the presidential campaign . When the deacons panicked and canceled services the Sunday before Election Day , Pastor Bruce Edwards told reporters that the eleven-year-old policy was " immoral and sinful " and that deacons routinely used the term niggers . At President-elect Carter 's urging , the church later voted reluctantly to admit blacks . But an Old South faction , which disliked both Edwards ' remarks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvered to fire the pastor . Edwards quit instead . The situation deteriorated until those who oppose the old guard and favor moderate racial views started worshiping by themselves last month . After a farewell sermon before the dissident Baptists this week , Edwards will fly to his new church in Makakilo , Hawaii . <P> The situation in Plains now is that the main church , which is looking for a new pastor , has voted to admit blacks but does not really want any . The dissident church , which says it would welcome blacks , does not so far have any .
