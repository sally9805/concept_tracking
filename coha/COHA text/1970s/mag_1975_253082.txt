HERZL by AMOSELON <P> 448 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . <P> $15 . <P> <P> His contemporaries labeled him " a political Jules Verne . " The term was pejorative ; Verne , after all , was producing outlandish fictions about lunar voyages and undersea exploration . Theodor Herzl was even more absurd . He helped create Zionism and predicted the return of the Jews to their homeland . Yet the comparison with Verne was more than superficial . Both men began as romantic visionaries who sought careers in law , then in the theater , then in literature . Verne went on to science fiction ; Herzl went on to Palestine . That bizarre journey has all the qualities of fin-de-sicle romance . It might have been told as a novel , a pageant-even as psychohistory . Instead , Israeli Journalist Amos Elon has chosen a method of slow accretion , scrupulously piling up dates and incidents , scarcely daring to speculate or interpret . The style is out of keeping with its subject . But Herzl is too powerful , too messianic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is his own illumination . <P> The easy correspondence between stage and life was never better illustrated than in this failed Hungarian playwright who dreamed of moving characters around on an international stage . Pushed by adoring and wealthy parents , he first affected the manner of an lgant , contributing feuilletons to the European press and plays to the Viennese public . Vienna circa 1890 was his home , at a time when that capital seemed the confluence of all that was worldly and intoxicating . It was also , according to Elon , a Versuchsstation des Weltuntergnges ( proving ground of world destruction ) . <P> For much of his life Herzl was strangely numb to evidences of antiSemitism . The Zionistic notion was merely an unworked plot until the Dreyfus trial . Then , as Paris correspondent for a Viennese paper , Herzl suddenly saw that the defendant was emblematic of his people . Captain Dreyfus might assume the insignia , the language , the official role , but in the end he would be betrayed and reviled .

As the Frenchman descended from hero to convict , the Hungarian rose from dilettante to provocateur . Herzl did not invent the idea of a Jewish state-the appeal of Return to Jerusalem is , after all , as ancient as the Diaspora . But Herzl alone took it from vision to plan to practicality . On the way he assumed the countenance and the stature of a prophet , sweeping all objections from his path . A feral magnetism began to animate his face and conversation . Philosopher Martin Buber was later to recall him as " a statue without error or mistake , a countenance lit with the glance of the Messiah . " Freud claimed that he had seen Herzl in a dream before they met . Others were less impressed . The Emperor Franz Josef , proud of his nation 's liberal airs , fumed : " What would have become of this ungrateful Herzl had there not been equality of rights for Jews ?
