BETTY FORD : The Most Since Eleanor <P> " I 'm the only First Lady to ever have a march organized against her , " boasted Betty Ford , 57 , after a chorus of black-clad women in front of the White House chanted their disapproval of her enthusiastic lobbying for the Equal Rights Amendment . Last year Betty became the most controversial-and popular-First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt , speaking out on a variety of once delicate topics . Abortion : " I feel it is the right of a human being to make her own decisions . " Marijuana : " It 's the type of thing that young people have to experience . " The prospect of a premarital affair for her teen-age daughter : " I would n't be surprised . . . But I 'd want to know pretty much about the young man . " Her candor is deliberate . Says she : " You 're very foolish if you try to beat around the bush-you just meet yourself coming around the bush the other way . " <P> Her matter-of-fact attitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows into the light of public discussion and understanding . WE LOVE BETTY placards sparkle in every crowd the President draws , and audiences break into applause at the mention of her name . <P> <P> CARLA HILLS : A Firm Hand at HUD <P> Betty Ford 's " pillow talk " - lobbying her husband to name a woman to the Cabinet for the first time in 23 years-was one reason that Carla Hills , 41 , became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development last March . As soon as the former Assistant Attorney General moved over to HUD , she began shaking up the bureaucracy with a speed and decisiveness that dazzled staff aides long used to a more lethargic pace . She found , for instance , that a rent-subsidy program for some 200,000 families had fallen so disastrously behind schedule that not a single family had been helped . Within three months , she managed to arrange subsidies for more than 90,000 families and then raised targets to 400,000 more for this year . Compulsively efficient , Hills has no patience for bureaucratic bungling : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate it ! " <P> Hills , whose father was a building-supplies millionaire , spent her childhood attending private schools , horseback riding , playing tennis ( she was captain of the Stanford women 's tennis team ) and living in the Beverly Hills mansion that was used as a set for Paramount 's Sunset Boulevard . After graduating from Yale Law in 1958 , she became an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , and later set up a law firm with her husband and friends in 1962 . She also taught at U.C.L.A. Law , wrote a handbook on antitrust cases and was co-author of a textbook , Federal Civil Practice . <P> <P> ELLA GRASSO : Gutsy Governor
