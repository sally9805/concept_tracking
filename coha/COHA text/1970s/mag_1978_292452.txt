Jesse Jackson wants a retrial <P> Pressure has mounted for years from black leaders who want a new trial for James Earl Ray , the petty gunman and thief serving a 99-year prison sentence for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr . a decade ago . Last week , after meeting with Ray for four hours inside Tennessee 's Brushy Mountain State Prison , Chicago Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson told reporters : " I do not believe he killed Dr. King . I believe Ray was coerced into pleading guilty to the murder . " <P> When King was shot , Jackson was standing near him outside a second-floor room of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis . Jackson visited Ray last week in response to one of a series of letters that the prisoner has been mailing to black leaders .
