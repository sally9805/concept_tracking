Jordan 's King Hussein may reasonably feel confident about being able to handle the fedayeen . Others have good reason to fear their random outbursts of terrorism . Among the guerrillas ' priority targets are Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel at the rate of 30,000 a year . Twice this year fedayeen groups set out to attack Schnau Castle in Vienna where the refugees , who travel from Russia to Austria by train , are quartered midway in their exodus . Both times the attackers were spotted beforehand and arrested . Two months ago , another terrorist band killed four innocent travelers at Athens airport when it confused a TWA plane loading for New York with another TWA plane boarding passengers for Israel . <P> Last week the terrorists tried again - and this time succeeded . When a passenger train en route from Moscow to Vienna via Warsaw stopped at the Czechoslovak city of Bratislava , two Arabs climbed aboard . They were carrying suitcases that turned out to be loaded with submachine guns and grenades . <P> When the train , carrying 39 Soviet Jews among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marchegg , the Arabs struck . They pulled the guns out of their valises , wounded one person , and took five Jews and one customs official aboard the train as hostages . <P> Two of their prisoners managed to escape in the confusion . But when the train stopped at Vienna , the others were hustled aboard a Volkswagen bus owned by the Austrian railroad . With the captured customs officer at the wheel , the bus rushed to Schwechat airport on the outskirts of the city . The Austrians were so anxious to avoid bloodshed that police cars , alerted to what had happened , escorted the bus to the airport instead of trying to stop it . <P> The terrorists identified themselves as " the Eagles of the Palestine Revolution . " That sounded like yet another unknown guerrilla splinter group , but Middle East sources reported that the kidnapers were almost certainly members of the extremist Black September movement . At the airport , the terrorists demanded that Austrian officials produce a passenger plane to carry the remaining Jewish hostages - two men and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Austrian officials , after consulting with Chancellor Bruno Kreisky , closed the airport and stubbornly refused to let the kidnapers and their hostages leave . <P> The fedayeen , hunched in the captured VW with a grenade on the dashboard and the terrified hostages cowering behind them , finally wore down the Austrians . After several hours of negotiations , Chancellor Kreisky authorized a light plane to fly the two fedayeen to Yugoslavia . The plane subsequently flew to Dubrovnik and on to Sicily , Sardinia and Malta while the terrorists tried desperately to gain permission to land in Libya or Algeria . <P> For the release of the hostages , Kreisky , a Jew , also made an incredible concession : the government agreed to close down Schnau Castle and no longer let Israel use Austria as a way station for emigrating Soviet Jews . If he holds to his word , the two fedayeen responsible for the Israeli-Arab conflict 's first train-jacking had scored an astounding coup indeed .                    @
