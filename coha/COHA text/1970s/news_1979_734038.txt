txt Chicago Tribune Press Servico . WASHINGTON ? Inflation at t h e wholesale level soared at an annual rate of more than 15 per cent in January , the government said Friday in a report that severely damaged President Carter 's voluntary wage-price guidelines . The Bureau of Labor Statistics sate that wholesale prices for finished goods rose by a stunning 1.3 per cent , the largest monthly increase since November , 1974 , when President Richard Nixon 's wage-price controls were removed . This one-month rise surpassed the entire year 's inflation for 1962 . What hurt Carter 's guidelines is the way in which the price hikes slid through the President 's voluntary guidelines program . For the first time in more than four years , the report said , all major components of the index rose by more than 1 per cent . Consumer food prices took a quantum jump of 13 per cent , with beef and veal prices alone leaping by 13 per cent . That 's particularly bad news for supermarket shoppers . BUT JUST name It and it was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasoline up ' 4.2 per cent , home heating oil , tobacco , milled // Tribune Chart Prices take biggest jump in 4 years BUT IT COULD also mean that companies are boosting their prices in anticipation of even stronger government restraints , perhaps mandatory wageprice controls , later in the year . Another explanation was that Carter 's wage-price program puts only mild restraints on inflation in basic necessities , such as food . housing , and energy . It is in these areas largely outside the program where prices have risen most . Carter 's answer to solve inflation in these areas has been merely to appoint task forces to " study " the problems . Friday 's inflation report means that most of these price rises will be passed along to consumers ? if they have n't already been . It also deals a terrible psychological blow to Carter 's anti-inflation program and likely will put additional pressure on the value of the dollar .

Jody Powell called the big jump " disturbing news . " He said those who had // rice , black pepper , heavy machinery , and trucks . And here 's even worse news for the future : Crude prices , on products just beginning their way through the production chain , jumped by 2.4 per cent . The White House urged patience . Alfred E. Kahn , chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability , described the 1.3 per cent increase in wholesale prices as " terribly widespread and troublesome . " " I do n't want to sound like a pollyanna , " Kahn told the Senate Banking Committee as he asserted that there is still a " strong probability " that the administration 's anti-inflation goals could be met . The President has projected a 7.4 per cent inflation rate for the year , compared with 9 per cent last year . Kahn said most of the administration 's moves to combat inflation have yet to be felt , although he noted some success in moderating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal restraint " simply has n't begun to bite yet . " Kahn said , that part of the increase may have resulted from many companies taking their six-month price increases allowable under the price guidelines in January . opposed the President 's budget cuts should now reconsider . But it was unclear how the budget cuts would have affected last month 's increase . Carter 's proposed cuts do n't go into effect until October . In fact , if inflation continues at January 's wholesale pace , it might increase the budget deficit because it would raise the cost of Carter 's " real wage insurance " program . This scheme promises fax rebates to workers who agree to hold their pay boosts to 7 per cent . AND IF THE increases continue at that pace , it would lead workers going into this spring 's crucial labor negotiations to ask for much sharper inerease4 than hoped by the administration . Another negative factor is that beef prices are expected to ' continue to rise for the next several months because producers have yet to rebuild their herds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight world oil market and oil and gasoline prices are expected to rise again .
