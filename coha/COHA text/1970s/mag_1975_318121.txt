THE SEVEN DAYS OF CREATION by VLADIMIR MAXIMOV 415 pages . Knopf. $10 . <P> <P> Like other dissident Russian authors , Vladimir Maximov , 44 , has a well-earned lien on the attention of U.S. readers : Western sympathies are automatically stirred by anyone who tilts a pen at totalitarianism . As his writings during the post-Stalinist thaw grew increasingly cool toward Communist ideology , Soviet authorities turned frigid . Maximov 's support of party nonpersons , including Alexander Solzhenitsyn , finally brought about his own forced exile to Paris last year . <P> So The Seven Days of Creation arrives with good intentions stamped all over it . Originally published in Germany in 1971 ( and still banned in the Soviet Union ) , the book is a loose recounting of 20th century Russian history seen through the eyes of three aging brothers . Pyotr and Andrei Lashkov have become provincial Communist Party functionaries , while Vasilii acts as a morose janitor for a Moscow apartment house . All are profoundly disillusioned by the course their lives and land have taken . For them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pyotr wonders , " Why ? Why ? Why ? " <P> In framing his answer , Maximov eagerly risks comparison with Tolstoy , Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn . Souls , he insists , have been parched by the enforced loss of mystical Christianity in Mother Russia . Maximov 's art is not yet ready for such awesome competition . His novel is a string of craftsmanlike vignettes awash in hyperbole . Emotions are so consistently overwrought that tempestuousness is soon diminished to nagging petulance . Some of the blame may belong to the translation . One Russian greets another with an improbable , hearty " Hallo , Pal " or a " Come on , Boss . " <P> The Seven Days of Creation is another example of the human spirit speaking out when silence is prudent . Yet it is demeaning to praise something not because it is well done but because it was done at all . The truth is the novel reads like English subtitles to an epic silent film , always flickering just beyond its grasp . " Paul Gray       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
