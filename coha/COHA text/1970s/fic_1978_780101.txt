 | temporary and that very soon they would Ix ? hungry and in rags . Robert Arend waited for the first signs of the violence he was sure would come . It was why the pickets were there , why they had chosen a predominantly Jewish neighborhood for their demonstration . He had watched them before , had studied their tactics . Know your enemy , he had once been taught , and he knew them . He had a little old Jew buried inside him , a bearded , peddler , weaving through ancient shtetls with a violin under his chin , and the old man knew them too . A waiter came out with a hose and began spraying both sidewalk and pickets . The marchers were soaked but never broke stride . Silently , they followed their leader , John Hartewell , a tall , straightbacked young man who marched as though at the head of a crack regiment . Arend studied his face . It was only a lift above ordinary , but the experience in the face was not , and so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an achievement , for they were not near to heroes , this bunch , but only a handful of punks and street-brawlers . Robert Arend waited , feeling like a wrecked sailor in the lull between two storms . Come on , he thought , addressing the crowd , addressing the smell of wakened fears and growing anger , come on and get them . Finally , you 're going to have to do it , so you might as well do it now . Whom are you trying to fool , standing there with your fine , assimilated looks and liberated airs ? Do n't you know you 'll be ghetto dwellers forever ? There 's no exit for you . Not even America can set you free . Wherever you go , you 'll carry the ghetto inside you . Even sleeping , you still wear the Star of David pinned to your pajamas , as your fathers and grandfathers did and as your children will do , each in his own bed , dreaming his own American dream . Then someone tripped Hartewell and he went down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' signs , found them , tore them to shreds . Arend pushed through the crowd . When he reached the fallen leader , he helped him to his feet . Hartewell looked at him and raised his arms to block the expected blows . Robert Arend grinned . " Hey , let 's get us a few Jews , " he said , and swung at the nearest of the advancing faces , thinking , sorry landsleit , as he  | felt bone against hone and watched the surprised Jewish face disappear . It was all part of it . Necessary rituals of brutality . Hurt them a little now , to spare them worse later . In a violent world , you learned to make violence work for you . He swung again and kept swinging as the crowd closed in , aware of the blue armbands fighting beside him , seeing the hard , cold eyes that were there for just this purpose . Giving and taking punishment was their metier and it was all based on an inviolate set of rules . The picket line was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them , were always beaten first . If they were tough enough , they survived it and got to clobber a few themselves . At the first sound of police sirens , Arend fought clear of the battle area and lost himself in the crowd . He had done what he had come there to do . Hartewell had gotten a good , clear look at him . When he saw him again , he would recognize him as a friend and sympathizer . At a large , quietly elegant cocktail party in Beverly Hills , California , Judi Haynes savored what she believed to be her third martini ( it was actually her fourth ) and concentrated on the man beside her . Her perceptions , always acute , had never been as finely tuned , and she felt an air come off him , carnal as a freshly cut piece of meat . And with it , rising from under his cologne , that special fragrance of the rich and powerful . " I 'm ashamed to admit it , " he was saying , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . I suppose that 's completely unforgivable . " " Completely . " " Do I kill myself now or later ? " She looked at him , a tall , physically imposing man with a well tended body and year-round tan . His eyes went from grey to blue and could twinkle , but you also knew they could buy you , sell you , close you out and bury you . " You may very well be capable of killing , Mr. Terrill , but I somehow ca n't imagine it ever being yourself . " " You 're probably right . " He smiled and his eyes were blue and  | purring and Judi remembered hearing people say he had the charm to capture anything alive if he wanted it . " Are you as good an actress as you are a prophet ? " " Well , I 've lasted for fifteen years out here . When a woman lasts that long in this business , she has to have more going for her than face , legs , and breasts . " " She might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never did . " She shook her head . " I do n't mean to sound self-righteous . If I 'd had to , I probably would have . I just never had to . " " No husbands either ? " " One . Briefly . But there was no practical help from there , either . Only love . A luxury I allowed myself . " The mention of husbands reminded her that he did have a wife present , and she looked across the room at her , past the usual haphazard Hollywood mixture of professions and generations , of performers , producers , public officials , and business people . Attractive enough , she thought , but probably fifteen years older than she looked from where she stood . They aged well , these cool , tight New England virgins , with a slow inside drying that could fool you in a good light up to a distance of three feet . Then it could be frightening . " Do you really think love is a luxury ? " he said . " I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you ? " The question was deliberate and more than a little spiteful , because she knew the kind of money and influence into which he had married . Not that he had come to the union empty-handed . He was self-made , up to a point . But what his wife 's family had brought him had taken a hundred and fifty years to put together , and he simply did not have that kind of time . " Maybe , " he answered . " But I 'm still enough of a romantic not to enjoy hearing it from the mouth of a beautiful woman . You must be tougher than you look . " " Yes . I am . " She sighed . " Is n't that too bad ? " He said nothing , but looked at her glass , which was now empty , and took it from her to refill , allowing his hand to touch hers . She felt an electric sense of promise , much as if a warm breeze had  | brushed her flesh . She watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck with a delayed vision of just how drunk she was , as if drunkenness were a fast car speeding through the dark , and the buzzing in her head akin to the murmur you hear in a tunnel . She had a sudden fear of the man walking away . For she had managed to achieve all that could be expected of a first meeting , and knew he would probably call her sometime within the next few days . But what would she be into after that ? Still , by the time he returned , bearing her drink like a valuable prize , the worst of it had passed . " Hello , " she said , smiling , forcing herself to think of it as just another job . " I was beginning to miss you . " From a gray Chevrolet parked near the corner of a Georgetown street , Special Agent George Lewellyn sat watching the darkened house at 27 Birch Mews . He had waited several hours for its occupants to leave and had finally seen them drive off , yet he remained where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten something and would return . Only when a message came through on the radio-phone that they were well out of the district did Lewellyn act . Then he moved his car forward several blocks , picked up a small , black bag from the seat beside him , and walked back to Number 27 . The street was dimly lighted and deserted . He slipped , unseen , through some bushes and circled the house to the rear entrance . If a neighbor did happen to see him and report a prowler , an agent stationed with police communications would ensure the call was ignored . Lewellyn carried no credentials , nothing to connect him with the FBI . If surprised , he would simply go on acting the burglar and take off . By now anyway he was probably more thief than not . Twelve years of hold-up artists , mafiosi , cons , and paranoic killers had touched and passed close by him , and each must have contaminated his psyche . At times , he was n't quite sure what he was ... a hound after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bog . The kitchen door of Number 27 had a simple commercial lock and he picked it easily and went in . He had the house-plan memorized and needed no light to find the library . Once there , he closed 17  | the drapes and used a small flash to help him place a microphone in the ceiling fixture . Ile connected this and the telephone to a leased line that led to a monitoring room in the federal building . Then he went upstairs to the master bedroom and repeated the same procedures . He worked fast and skillfully , as a good surgeon works , hearing the sound of occasional traffic outside and the small , faint noises of the house itself . He knew his job and had good hands and took a certain pride in what they could do . Even if he did not always approve the purposes for which they were used , he still performed as best he could and tried to leave moral judgments to others . Every line of work has its dirty secrets , but his had more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt oppressed . It was something beyond him , some eternal seepage from the nation 's waste pipes . The more you held your breath , the more it stank . And at its worst , it was everywhere ; at work , at home , at Sunday doubleheaders . Yet why ? . . . he wondered . Were n't most of us well-fed and clothed , glutted with abundance ? Was n't America a lush , air-conditioned garden , where honest toil was nourishment , people lived in Hamburger-Heavens and the skies were not cloudy all day ? Maybe . But his job sent him down mean streets . It tore away the pink wrappings and exposed the maggots . Twisted tales of the New World . Blood flowed like honey through tenement walls . The hardheads got their livers chopped free of charge . Memorial candles burned day and night in ghetto windows . Everyone had their own landscapes . His was studded with a grotesque blend of violence and whipped-cream sundaes . The creatures who peopled his turf were conspicuously alien , fierce in emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of opportunity , refused to be bent to the mold . They would n't learn . Lewellyn tightened a final connection , put the earpiece back on the phone , and counted his tools as he returned them to the black bag . Six out , six in . Forget a screwdriver in this business and the earth shook . He stared dimly at the innocent-looking telephone , then up at the unseen bug . In a bright cubicle at FBI Headquarters , now connected to both , was a wakeful instrument , ready to note down every spoken word , every inflection of voice , all to be assayed and  | placed in some obscure future balance . Curiously , he swung the beam of light about the room , picking out chairs , beds , lamps , dressers , settling at last on a framed photograph of the subject , his wife , and two daughters , all smiling , all frozen forever in a moment of summer sun . It must have been an old picture because the girls , in college now , looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a full head of hair and a face free from lines . Christ , he had aged , Lewellyn thought , and felt a rich , burning exhaust go out of his lungs as though he were in a room with a fire . The flashlight in his hand , steady until now , suddenly began to quiver like a dowsing rod , as if some invisible evil lay hidden in the darkness . What insane spirits haunted the towers of these lords in high places ? His stomach felt oddly severed from the rest of him . Lewellyn switched off his flashlight , drew the drapes back to their original position , and silently fled Charles Brandenburg 's elegant Mews house which was now elegantly wired to betray him . 19  | It was during a summer shower that Michael Zaslow had once observed the creation of a rivulet . The rain had come down and the stream had started in a tiny crack in the road . The rivulet rolled down the road between pebbles and twigs and patches of earth , growing larger . With a gurgling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no way of knowing it was not a river . I 'm not a river either , Zaslow was thinking now . Probably not even a stream . But at least I know it . And I am flowing . Though not into any sewer . God , no . And he held the girl , Judi , closer by way of atonement . She sighed into his ear , then offered a kiss that was full of the smell of honeysuckle and very like a first kiss . Except that it was a gift , not a vow . There had never been any promises between them . Even now , in a Chicago hotel to which she had traveled from Beverly Hills and he from New York , the act of love was not the reason they were there . It was only a pleasant fringe benefit . Nevertheless , it had been dealt with first . The true purpose of their meeting would come later . During the past week , the last in October , Zaslow had already met separately with Arend and Lewellyn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home had come as a surprise at a time  | when Zaslow had begun to consider himself beyond surprise . Which was foolish , of course . Functions might be conditioned , but rarely emotions , and he still tended to react with his gilt . Still , you did not expect them to casually violate the privacy of the President 's closest advisor . Brandenburg was due for a shock . As for Robert Arend , there had been nothing new or startling in any of his information . Nor would there be until he actually joined the Party . All those crackpot groups looked pretty much alike from the outside . A few malcontents and neurotics scratching for attention . Even monitoring them seemed a waste of time . What you had to keep remembering was that it had started precisely the same way in Germany . The room was high in the hotel and outside the wind was up . Lying there with the girl , Zaslow could hear it too well and it had the sound of a hungry wind at sea . Somewhere , a siren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sour rot of blood in the streets . It brought him something close to nausea because there were mysteries there to which he would never find solutions . And he had a sudden hatred of all mystery , a moment when he wanted his life reduced to clear , simple events with logical answers . God , he wanted to ask , why ca n't I just lie in a room and love a woman , with no thought reaching past her and the four sides of the bed ? Knowing him , she had felt it almost as soon as he . " Well , it was nice , was n't it ? " He smiled at her in the lamplight , at that perfect face on the pillow , a face no longer spectacularly young , only spectacular , with the sort of clean features you know you 've seen on movie screens and advertisements , all over the country . Yet there was something even more special about this face , a silvery cunning in the way it was woven together , a quiet air of hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment and now a delicate humor had formed to cover the hurt . He had known her for sixteen years , since the time she had walked into a political science seminar he was conducting at UCLA and revealed a brain almost the match of her looks . She 'd had an instinct for politics even at the age of eighteen , a knowledge that the ability to influence was sovereignty . It was her greatest strength and she had used it . 2I  | " How many times do you think we 've made love ? " she asked lazily . " Together ? " Do n't be smart . " " I stopped counting at two hundred and seventy-six . " Propped on one elbow , she lit a cigarette , breasts lolling nicely . " It could n't really be that many , could it ? " " Spread over all those years , it 's not really that impressive . " The number was , of course , a joke , but the continuity was impressive . At least , for him . His wife 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not even had it with her . Love was love and he had found it with women he had known for a night and never knew again , and with others he had seen for months . He supposed that at a particular moment you could find it with almost anyone . It was just that you could rarely hold onto it . " Someday I 'm going to have to think about that . " She looked wistful as she said this , then gave a tough sensuous grin . " Phil Terrill called me from a New York airport the other night . He wants to see me as soon as he gets back from London . " " It 's nice to know you have n't lost your touch . " " Did you think I had ? " " No . But you have to remember we 're talking about a man who can have just about anything he wants in this world . " " That sounds a little frightening . " " Make no mistake about it . " She lay back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I get into these things ? " " You 're not into it yet . " " No , but I will be . " " Not if you do n't want to . " " Oh , stop it , Mike . " " I mean it . You do n't owe anyone a thing . You 've already done more than your share . " " Really ? How do you measure it ? " He did not say anything . " This is important , is n't it ? " she asked .  | " Yes . " " Then start briefing me . " He stroked her hair where it caught the light on the pillow , still fine hair , soft and silky , despite the years of tinting . She smiled at him with that look of naked relaxation that comes after great joy or grief or good sex . " Lordy , Lordy , you do know how to make a woman feel loved . But I 'm all right now . Honestly . So let 's get on with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only what I 've heard and read . He 's head of the Manhattan National Bank , is n't he ? " " Yes , but that 's just the outer skin of the onion . A dozen layers are under it . Terrill and his wife 's family , the Rochemonts , control companies with combined annual revenues greater than the gross national product of Ireland . They do business in more than seventy countries . When Philip Terrill travels abroad , he 's received by heads of state . They compete for his favor . He can prop up shaky governments , or help them fall . So you see , he 's quite a boy , your Phillip . " " He 's not my Philip . " " He will be . " " All right . Now tell me why you 're suddenly so interested in him . " " It 's not sudden . We 've kept an active file on the Rochemonts and Terrill for years . We also have a few people working for them , but they ca n't get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her . It was a question of policy , not trust . They were all better off knowing only as much as they had to . And in this case the threads were so numerous and complex , it would have taken hours to unwind them . " Do n't worry about specifics for now . Just try to soak in as much as possible . Bits of conversation , attitudes . The usual list . And especially what comes out during the looser moments . You know the times . " " Of course . I 'm an expert on them . " The lamplight was good for her , the right hue on a pale blonde since it gave a fine edge of silver to the shadows in her face . But Zaslow also saw the bitter hollow in her eyes , and knew what was coming now . 23  | " I guess what bothers me most , " she said , " is that I 'm not bothered more than I am . What 's wrong with me ? Have I just got the mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all the right answers , about ultimate goals and everything . But what it finally comes down to is that I 'm trading my ass . And it does n't really break me up . " " Yes it does . " " Maybe a little . When I 'm low . But not enough . " " How much penance do you need ? " " A lot I guess . I 'm a Jew , are n't I ? " " Who is n't ? " He smiled , but often had to fight the same battle himself . He had all the formulas , very controlled , but they could carry much pain . The need to be right burned in his chest ; also , the luxurious joy of dedication to a cause . What else could explain the continuing intensity of a twenty-year-old dedication ? " Do you think God understands what we 're doing ? " she said . " I hope so . I explain it to Him every night . " " My part too ? " " Especially that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this crazy idea that when I did something wrong , when I was weak , evil , or foolish , I lessened God . " She laughed . " I 'll tell you . It got a little hard to carry . Maybe that 's why I was so eager to help when you first asked me . It seemed like a chance to balance things a bit . " " You 've done some very lovely balancing . " " It 's nice to believe . When I can . I know I 'm silly not to . Why fool myself ' ? I live and work in a climate where bed partners are changed with the linen . I 'm not that morally superior , Michael . If it were n't for you , for Chai , I 'd probably be doing the same things for far less reason . " The mood fading , she turned and held him , her face bright with the look of a child touched by angels . " And there 's always you for a bonus , is n't there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought you were the bonus . " Zaslow had arranged to meet with Charles Brandenburg on his way back from Chicago . He did not know the presidential advisor 24  | personally and it had taken some effort to make the contact and apply the necessary pressure . Brandenburg was more than just an advisor . There were those who claimed his not inconsiderable brain was planted squarely in the President 's skull . An exaggeration , of course . No man could think for another . All he could do was persuade . Which , when the moon was right , was probably enough . The President was no fool , thought Zaslow . His house , his child , yea , all that a man bath will he give for wisdom , said the Talmud . Arrangements for the meeting were handled by the senior Senator from Connecticut , who had also rented a suitably anonymous motel room just outside Washington . Zaslow arrived precisely at the agreed upon nine o'clock but found Brandenburg already there , a man of average height with a slender body and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shadings of pink . He appeared older than his news pictures , and there was a definite presence to him , a fortified air of confidence which is often found in the company of generals , politicians , and newspaper publishers . They shook hands and looked at one another , and Zaslow felt the kind of cold pall you feel the moment there is silence in a house of mourning . " I know how busy you are , " he said . " Thank you for coming . " " Save your thanks , Professor . I 'm not here through choice . Senator Holtzman thought I should see you , and I respect his judgment . " There was an even , raw gaze in Brandenburg 's eyes that stung like salt . " Which does n't mean I would n't enjoy meeting you under different conditions . I found your Origins Of Prejudice fascinating reading . Very provoking . But my God ! Why all this urgency and mystery . I do n't understand it . " " You will in a moment . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snifters and Michael poured two drinks . Then he selected a chair and eased into it , a general preparing his positions . He knew about this New York lawyer who had the President 's good ear , this slender German Jew who would barter his blood to make claw marks on Mount Rushmore . He had come to Washington by way of Harvard and Wall Street , but they still saw that little gray Yid hiding 25  | in his pupik and they were n't going to let him forget it . " I 've asked you here , " he said , " because I thought you should know that for the past week you 've been under surveillance . The telephones in your home and office have been tapped , microphones planted in your study and bedroom , and you may even have been followed here tonight . " Brandenburg 's eyes blinked once . Otherwise , he showed nothing . " I suppose you have proof of this . " Michael put down his brandy , took a small recorder from an attache case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he nodded and Zaslow switched off the machine . " All right , " said Brandenburg . " Who 's setting me up ? " " I do n't know who ordered it , but the FBI is doing the work . " " Are you with the Bureau ? " " No . " " How did you get the tape ? " " I know some people . " " Then you 're CIA ? " " No . I 'm not with any government agency . Let 's just say I 'm an interested friend . " " We 're not friends , Dr. Zaslow . Why should you be interested in me ? " " Because you 're the single most influential Jew in our government today . " " Meaning ? " " What happens to you could affect a lot of us . " As though measuring the curves of a breast , Brandenburg palmed both hands about his brandy snifter . " So that 's it . " Michael remained silent . " From time to time , " said Brandenburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite frankly , they always seemed rather apocryphal and I never payed much attention to them . What is it you call yourselves ? Chai ? " " We do n't call ourselves anything , Mr. Brandenburg . For all practical purposes , we do n't even exist . And Chai is nothing more than the Hebrew word for life . "  | Brandenburg 's voice was genial , vaguely mocking . " Well , whatever you are , mythical or otherwise , you have my thanks . It 's comforting to know I 'm being looked after . Especially since I 've never really considered myself a member-in-good-standing of the Jewish Community . " " To our Christian brethren , you 're always a member-in-goodstanding of the Jewish community . " " I 'm sorry , but I 'm simply not that paranoid about my religion . If I 've ever felt threatened , it 's been as Charles Brandenburg , nor as a Jew . " " Then you 've been lucky . At least , until now . " Brandenburg made an impatient gesture . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a Jew ? " " Do you find the idea so incredible ? " " Absolutely ! " The best brains were always so certain , thought Zaslow , it almost made them naive . " Then why do you think you 're being watched ? " " I have no idea . The Bureau has evolved into a kind of monster lately . All sorts of inanities take place under the heading of national security . They probably feel they 're guarding me against crackpots , subversives , and spies . But you can be sure I 'll find out fast . I intend to speak to the President about it in the morning . " " Please do n't . " Brandenburg 's eyes protruded , suddenly more Germanic than Jewish . " Why on earth not ? " " Because I need time to find out what 's behind it . You see , I do believe it involves your being a Jew . And not because I 'm paranoid on the subject , but because I 've also had recent surveillances reported on a Jewish Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it 's just coincidence . " " You 're chasing shadows , Professor . There 's less anti-Semitism in this country today than at any time in its history . " " That 's exactly what they once said in Spain and Germany . " Brandenburg 's face was altogether calm , but a vein in his forehead had begun to pulse . " I think you do have delusions of persecution . " 27  | " I wish they were only delusions . " " No , you do n't . You professional Jews thrive on threats of disaster . You need something to beat your breasts about or you feel cheated . What 's a Jew without his daily dose of grief and mourning ? " He threw Zaslow a quick , hard look . " If I had my way , I 'd even disband the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith . It 's a ridiculous indulgence . All that idiotic publicity . You do n't eliminate prejudice by accusing people and screaming about it . You only make it worse . " Zaslow nodded slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to reason . They do no good at all . Because antiSemitism has nothing to do with reason . It 's a passion . And we ca n't change that . All we can hope to do is fight it wherever we can . " " So you take blood oaths in a mystic conspiracy ? " " Nothing so dramatic . We just do what we feel has to be done . You see , they 've finally taught us to be pragmatic about survival . It 's a little like going to war . If it does n't kill you , it calms you down . To survive , you cultivate a distance from events and methods . " " And from laws , too ? " Zaslow shrugged . " If they get in the way . Though it 's never easy for us . We spring from such an innately law-abiding tradition . " " I 'm beginning to think you people could be dangerous . " " To whom ? " " To all of us . When things are going reasonably well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Zaslow looked into his glass as if the quiver of light in the brandy was the entrails of a religious sacrifice . " We 're not the ones giving you trouble , Mr. Brandenburg . " " I told you . My being Jewish has nothing to do with that . " " I 'd still like time to check it out . " Brandenburg hesitated . " How much time ? " " I do n't know . " " You do n't expect me to put up with this nonsense indefinitely . " " I did n't have to tell you about it at all . I did have that choice . " " I suppose you did , " said Brandenburg slowly . He stood up , looking as though he expected to be attacked , and Zaslow sensed the crack in his certainty , was able to shake out the itch of his dirty little  | secret . The poor bastard had suddenly been made to feel so damned Jewish , had all at once been forced to join him as a fellow traveler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents scrubbed them , pressed their clothes , sent them out with clean fingernails and a smile for the Christian teacher ? But after centuries of floundering , could we ever feel our feet on really solid ground ? Brandenburg said , " All right . I 'm not ungrateful . I do owe you something . Just try to get them off me as quickly as possible . " The presidential advisor left the motel first . Through an opening in the drapes , Zaslow watched his car pull away , followed , a moment later , by another . He waited at the window . When he saw the lights of a third car take off after the others , he finished his drink and also left . 29  | Robert Arend was nervous . More than that , he felt a flashing sense of dread . It was not a physical fear , nor even one born of religion . Houses of worship held no greater significance for him than any other buildings . They were without blood , breath , or visible life . Razed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arend 's dread was real , as if all such structures were a necessary part of some eternal housing plan and , once destroyed , deprived a host of souls of final shelter . And at this moment , as his first official Party assignment , he was on his way to burn one of them down . The records of the American Renaissance Party would later show that Robert Arend had filled out his membership questionnaire on the morning of October 21 , 1965 , and , along with nine other recruits , took the required loyalty oath exactly two weeks later . The oath read : To FRIEDRICH WILHELM NIETZSCHE , the philosophical leader of our struggle for an idealistic world order against the forces of Zionism , I pledge my reverence and respect . To THE LEADERS OF THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE PARTY , I pledge my faith , courage , and obedience to all Party orders .  | To THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , I pledge my loyalty and my compliance with its Constitution and laws until those which are unjust can be legally changed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecute me because they have been brainwashed , I pledge my patience and my understanding . To THE TRAITORS TO MY NATION , I pledge swift and ruthless justice . The oath was administered by John Hartewell at the Party 's headquarters in a converted mansion on Cleveland 's West Boulevard . Two flags flew in front of the building  --  the American and the Party 's own double-headed eagle . There was also a coat-of-arms carved into the Gothic entrance arch , but this had nothing to do with either the Republic or the Party . It had simply been put there by the builder for added distinction . Passing under it that first day , Arend was only vaguely aware of the rampant unicorn and serpent over his head . Yet some whiff of ancient heraldry , some hot breath of forgotten evil must have come off that fake crest and passed into his lungs , because he had felt its sting going down . Now he was heading further into it , though not alone . There were two other Party novitiates with him and Arend sat sandwiched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode without speaking , rtlte streets deserted , the city dark and quiet . The beast slept , Arend thought . His companions were as nervous as he , but for different asons . There was real risk ahead , as well as fear of failure .

In his briefing , art ewell had put it differently , describing the proposed arson as just Attie exercise in public relations , a subtle conditioning of the public ex . Fire had profound mystic overtones . It went all the way back the public burnings of the Inquisition , to the universal appeal of auto-da fe .

He had graduated with honors from West Point , served the required number of years , then having gotten all he needed from the army , had left it for his own brand of politics . Arend had never known anyone quite like him . What a curious sonofabitch , he thought ; what a useful man to have on your side . The driver braked for a red light , then changed his mind and ran it . The other man swore . " Jesus , you 'll get us picked up before we even do anything . " Arend stared through the windshield and said nothing . How much simpler if the police did stop them . Though it would only mean a postponement . It would still have to be done . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known how to handle it . Training and experience told him what he must do , but he had been tempted to contact Zaslow anyway . Which would have been wrong , of course . This was all his . But you forget , he thought , you forget some of the beauties of this work . Well , remember then , he told himself , and stop your complaining . The Professor had said there would be times like this , and the longer Robert Arend was around and the more he did , the wiser Zaslow seemed . Yes , but this was still one bitch of an assignment . " In this , " Zaslow had warned him , " you 're going to have to do things that will be the exact opposite of what you want to do , things that will make you sick . But you 'll do them . " " I hope I can , " Arend had said . " I 'm not worried about that , " Zaslow told him . " What you 've ever had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's no fool . Some of his tactics may seem simple and crude , even ridiculous , but he does nothing without a reason . He 's a master creator of hate fantasies for those who need them most . He offers a clear , definable enemy as a salve for guilt , failure , and frustration , and that 's an irresistable panacea . We may dismiss them all as hate-mongers and 32  | emotional perverts , but history has raised statues to their leaders , the dictators and inquisitors . So do n't make the mistake of feeling superior . It could be fatal . " At the moment , Arend was feeling something less than superior . And the men on either side of him were no help . Ryan and Kojinski . He was going to set fire to a schul with a Mick and a Polack and this was supposed to finally save the Jews ? Ryan was driving , a bony man with a pug nose whose nostrils cut the air so broadly his intelligence seemed to be concentrated there . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , were scarred , a careless worker 's or a fighter 's hands . Kojinski , curiously enough , worked in the municipal library and looked to have an angry ulcer , for he moved with quick , irritable gestures . They were both young and had taken the Party oath the same day as Arend . Sitting between them , Robert knew the sweet panic of an animal being tracked . Their target was close to the river , in an old section of rundown tenements and lofts . Nearing it , Ryan parked the car on Berea Road and they walked the remaining distance . The synagogue was a small , ort hadox relic with a Moorish dome , the kind of vanishing schul , t bought Arend , that used to have a line of bearded elders sitting in front whenever there was sun . His great grandfather had sat in front of one just like it , and he remembered being taken inside when he was very small and standing among the men wrapped in their great prayer shawls , their bodies swaying and voices rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had usually fallen asleep . A rite of passage , a litmus test for entry into the New World . You progressed from there . And always farther away . Finally , you seemed to stop being a Jew altogether and became something called an American . You thought . There was an alley at the side of the building and they went in and stumbled through a jungle of litter . Ryan pried open a basement window and he and Kojinski climbed through . Arend remained on watch outside , grateful for not having actually to perform the act himself . Small consolation . Oppression and guilt still remained , condensed now with the alley stink . There were no witnesses . The alley walls were blank , the surrounding streets deserted . Yet a dybbuk 's  | voice cut the night . " Was a time you let me love you . Was a time I covered you from the cold . Now you cast me out , spit on my stones . What am I , a toy to be used and thrown away ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know what you 're doing to me ? He knows . And a day will come when voices rise and the skies turn red . Then , finally , you 'll know how you need me . Then you 'll come praying , and I 'll put together my broken stones and open my arms and make you warm once more . " Ryan and Kojinski reappeared and they left the alley . " A breeze , " said Ryan , all nervousness gone . " Nothing to it . " Arend 's throat was tight . " You 're sure the place was empty ? " " It 's three o'clock in the morning , for Christ 's sake ! Even Jews do n't pray at three o'clock in the morning . " " Sure , " said Kojinski . " Stop worrying . We 're not roasting any Yids . " He grinned . " Not yet , anyway . " They drove out of the immediate area , parked , and waited until they saw it , a dome of colored air that grew like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirling lights and sirens going . They gave it a while longer , then walked back to look . Fire engines jammed the block and a crowd of people had gathered , even at this hour , with more faces at the windows . The air was thick with smoke , and in it , Arend felt he could still sniff the essential smells of the synagogue , layer upon layer of old men , moth-balled clothing , worm-eaten books , ancient , smoothly rubbed benches . The odor of piety ? It impressed him that neither fire nor water could choke out that immemorial perfume , - He imagined the ark of the covenant , crowned with the two mystical hands , thumbs and index fingers touching ; and below , in the curtained cabinet , the sacred scrolls themselves , all going or gone , all rising in smoke . Fire hoses were everywhere , fat as cobras , hissing from their joints . Arend tried to see the synagogue but found it masked by heads , by searchlights and upward waterfalls , by something mystical about the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowd grew and waited , silent , held by a pack sense of smell . Death was in heat . The flames were slowly smothered . The walls and part of the roof still stood . Firemen wetted down the wreckage and 34  | searched behind scorched bricks . Windows were bright with searchlights , a skeleton full of fireflies . Arend closed his eyes , swaying slightly , feeling precariously heavier than his bones . The crowd stirred and he heard a long sigh . He opened his eyes and saw three firemen carrying out a strange container , a green rubber bag around a shapeless package . " Poor old Skulnick , " someone said . " Who was he ? " a man asked . " An old zada , a reb with whiskers . You 've seen him around . Sometimes he slept with his books in the basement . Must have been smoking in bed . " Arend stared dumbly at Ryan and Kojinski . The murdering bastards . And they said they had looked . He wanted anger but just felt sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone in himself , made sure , but it had been easier to wait outside . He looked at the rubber package , at the invisible zada in his final green container . Sorry , Skulnick . He had never seen the old scholar , but knew him . lie also knew his books , with their yellowed pages and tiny Hebrew lettering spiced with truths from some Skulnick in pre-Christian Jerusalem , to the Skulnicks of the Diaspora , to this late Skulnick in Cleveland , U.S.A. , truths two thousand years in transit and miraculously preserved amid pogrom , famine , and the ignorance of Christians . Until tonight . Ile turned and walked away through the crowd , dimly aware of Ryan and Kojinski behind him . He wished he could put it down as just had luck or God 's will , but he had never been much of a believer in Tither of these things . Maybe they were both up there someplace , but blame stopped for him in the human world . And for this particular disaster , once he got past Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be able to go would be the top of John Hartewell 's head I he telephone woke Judi Haynes and she answered it irritably . " Year ? " " There 's no need to snap my head off . If you feel that bad , I 'll pu away . " It was a man 's voice and it was amused and even half 35  | asleep , Judi recognized it as Philip Terrill 's . " Oh , " she said . " Hello . " " It 's raining out and the forecast calls for rain all day . " " Did you call me at seven in the morning to give me the weather report ? " He laughed . She had once told him that his laugh had a black sound and she meant precisely that . " I think you already know me better than that . " " You figured I 'd have no outdoor shooting ? " " Exactly . " " And you want to see me for lunch ? " " Yes . Also , before and after . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it nine-thirty . " She hung up and stared out at the rain , one of those downpours endemic to California that seem created to either wash the state clean of its sins or sweep it into the sea . She was just as pleased not to be working that day . There was a time when a shooting cancellation would have let her down , but not anymore . And especially not in her current role , which she had known from the start was a bad one , but which she had taken anyway because you got tired of waiting for the good ones . If you were an actress , you acted . You were seen and heard . Otherwise , you just disappeared and no one ever bothered to ask what happened to you . In bed , her body felt sluggish , morning-heavy , an aging machine waiting to be oiled and cranked-up . But still servicable , she thought , still in reasonably decent repair . Nevertheless , she could feel her nerves wriggling like a hive of worms at the prospect of what lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Today , he would lead into the next step of their little ritual mating dance . It would be the third time she was seeing him and she had a feeling about the number three , a sense of expectation that was half hope and half fear . It had all been relaxed enough so far , but the man was a masterwork of innuendo . He had not touched her , yet was unable to utter a sentence without giving a subtle tinkle of seduction to some wholly innocent word . His voice may have been that of a man you would not trust for an instant , but she did not know if she could forget it . If he were 36  | just another man , the whole thing might even have been pleasurable . As it was , any such hope had been exploded in advance by the nature of ' her assignment . Still , when she was altogether depressed with herself , it seemed her work for Chai was the single worthwhile achievement to which she could point . The rest balanced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furies of her ego had grabbed their fair share of cash , fame , and the more certified playboys of the Western world , and she made no apologies for any of it . But Chai nevertheless remained a form of payment , an attempt at evening up . Hidden moralities ( or was it just superstition ? ) said you replaced what you took out or you finally ran dry . Unless this , too , was a kind of ego , and she really needed Chai the way a drum majorette needed the meaning of the hand behind her . If so , then the meaning it offered her was her Jewishness , otherwise lost , even denied . She could find no true exit from it , no escape in art or ideology . Deny what you came from and you denied yourself . The only way out was the way in . Try to float above it and you risked a psychosis from which even Freud could n't save you . She had spent thousands of dollars and years on a couch , but it was Chai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Although you paid in other ways , and the biggest part of the price was freedom . But the reward was wholeness . That day , they made love for the first time in a small frame house at the edge of a lake in the Tehachapi Mountains . Yet they met less as lovers than as a pair of curious strangers exploring a new land . There was no enchantment or rapture . Only the act was loving . Ent wined , they remained as separate as two observers on the moon . To Judi , the house was part of the alien landscape . To Terrill , it was the womb . " I was horn in this house , " he told her later . " In this room . In this bed . Except that it was on a small farm in Pennsylvania then . I had it picked up , stick by stick , and moved out here . " He laughed at himself . " Fancy that for sentiment . Only I could n't abide where it was . I like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winds ? " She listened . " " They sound positively carnivorous . " 37  | " Well , I 've been a flesh-eater all my life . I feel uncomfortable among the gentler breeds . " " Thanks . " He smiled , but a hint of gray ice came off it . " I meant it as no insult . I 've always found passive people dull . " " Good . Because passive , I 'm not . " " I know that . I 've been studying your films . I had someone pick up your five latest and run them for me . I 'm now an expert on you . " " You mean you 're an expert on five screenwriters . " " No , " he said . " On you . On the way you walk and look and move . On the way you smile and frown . It did n't matter what they gave you to say . I did n't care about the words . Your air was exquisite in every scene . You were always in communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth . I could feel them . It was the first time I understood there was literally an enchantment of the cells , maybe even a Devil 's Morse code . If I wanted you before I saw those pictures , I wanted you doubly afterward . " " Me and how many others ? " " Not as many as you might think . I 've never really had that much time or interest . I 'm sure you 're far more practiced at this than I. Which is not an accusation . Just a fact . And one I 'm not especially interested in learning about . " " Fine . But that does n't mean I 'm not interested in learning about you . " " What do you want to know ? " " Everything that 's not in Who 's Who . Everything that 's deep , dark , and dirty . " He laughed . " I 'm really not all that exciting . " " I 'm sure . " " It 's true . I was actually kind of a simple young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and after school in the best Presbyterian tradition , and thought of little else but moving ahead and making money . In fact I was probably dull as all hell . Anyone that single-minded has to be dull . Unless , of course , he gets rich . Then he suddenly turns fascinating . Then everyone clamors for his advice , he dispenses wisdom like a watering can , and he never once  | mentions the two most important factors in his success . . . luck and timing . And even timing is mostly luck . So help me , " he said and held up his palm , " at nineteen , I invested two thousand dollars , all my savings , in an electronic gadget that went crazy . It gave me back half a million in four years . No brilliance . I only put up the money to help a friend . He could n't raise it anywhere else . Maybe you 'd call it casting bread on the waters , but it scared me half to death . I was just a poor hick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time with faith , hope , and hard work . It was during the depression . Know what half a million was in those days ? My God , I could n't have done anything wrong with it if I tried . The market was at rock bottom and half the country was foreclosed . You could have bought the whole State of Oklahoma for a dollar down and a dollar a month . I had no genius . At those prices it was impossible to pick anything but winners . And I just kept riding them . So at the age of twenty-eight , I had made a million dollars five times and was more scared than ever because I Anew it was all a mistake and that I did n't deserve it and that any minute someone was sure to tap me on the shoulder and tell me I had to give it all back . " fie smiled . His voice had rounded into humors and he seemed to be laughing at himself . " And then , of course , I met Joanne . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was more than just her looks that drew me . She was a Rochemont , one of the crowd that came over on the same boat as the DuPonts and went into banking instead of gunpowder . Even with live million I was still half yokel , but I had learned one thing about money . There were dollars that bought things and dollars that had influence . I had the first kind , the Rochemonts had the second . And I suddenly saw a chance at areas I had never even dreamed about . It was intriguing . If luck had carried me this far , how far could I go with a little planning ? " " So you married Joanne . " " So I married Joanne , " he said and sat thinking about it for a moment in the pine-walled room of a shack whose boards he had troubled to cart almost three thousand miles . " I guess everybody is  | looking for their own very special little pleasure , and I had n't really found mine . But I found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something of a talent . Call it even a Devil 's gift . Or God 's . You can take your choice . But whatever the name , I had it ... that feeling of knowing precisely what to do , and when , and having the courage to do it . I 'll tell you , I cut a swath through those Rochemonts . They never really knew what hit them . After two hundred years of money , a blood line runs thin . The hunger is too long gone , the wolves too long forgotten . And with my sharp , Pennsylvania-poor teeth , it was n't too hard to bite off as much as I wanted . And I 've loved every minute of it . " " And the money never got boring ? " she said . " If it were only money , it might have . But it was more than money by then . There were diversions . I had worked into a fair sampling of the media . . . newspapers , magazines , television . The opinion makers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to seek them out . They came to me . When you have something they need , a web is spun and you 're placed in the center . It 's your own web , but you 're hung there just the same and the threads can often get sticky . " He listened to the wind , then looked at her . " So you see , I 'm not really an agent of the Devil after all . What I do , mostly , is look for diversions and dabble , and there 's nothing very deep , dark , and dirty about even the worst of it . " He said this with an easy frankness , yet seemed ready to laugh at her . But whether it was for believing him , or for not believing him , was exactly the shade of difference she was unable to pick out . Once , in a Chicago restaurant , Special Agent George Lewellyn heard a voice from an adjoining table that he was sure he knew . He studied the man speaking , but had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one he had listened to for several weeks while monitoring wiretaps in that area . It gave him an odd sensation . He knew the man 's most intimate secrets , yet he was a stranger . A leaden anxiety settled in his stomach . His food tasted sour and he broke into a sweat . He felt if he did n't get out of that restaurant in 40  | thirty seconds , his new disease would take an even more virulent turn . Malignancies were made of moments like this , he thought , and paid his check and fled . The disease never disappeared entirely , but it did get better . So that now , years later , working in the Bureau 's Washington monitoring area , with its jumble of wires and banks of amplifiers and recorders , Lewellyn was able to share the private conversations of complete strangers and remain relatively free of symptoms . At the moment , he was listening to some of Charles Brandenburg 's tapes and feeling more relaxed than usual for this phase of his work . Since Brandenburg had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling . Still , slips could be made , although in Brandenburg 's case it was doubtful whether he even had anything to slip about . The man was so clean , he was antiseptic . Which was more than could be said for the other two whose surveillances Lewellyn had reported to Michael Zaslow . Blitzstein was a flagrant womanizer and Berman was just plain corrupt . An Under Secretary of State and a United States Senator , and the men were fools . If they had n't been warned , they 'd both be finished by now . Lewellyn had little patience with that sort of stupidity . Jews in high public office had to be doubly pure or doubly careful . In a predominantly Christian society , there was no such thing as a single , rotten Jewish apple . When they found one bad one , they marked the whole barrel lousy . And this was a condition in which Special Agent Lewellyn had more than just an academic interest . At the age of thirty-seven , he had been a closet-Jew for nineteen years , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1946 , as Arthur Rabin , and his entrance into Michigan State University , three months later , as George Lewellyn . With the help of Chai and some simple plastic surgery , his new Protestant identity was convincingly enough established to get him through law school and into the FBI . For the past seven years , he had been married to a Presbyterian girl whom he loved dearly and who loved him in return , but who had no idea he was anything other than what he appeared to be . They had one child , a six-year-old boy , and Marilyn was hoping for another pregnancy . When Lewellyn thought of his 41  | life , he considered himself reasonably well adjusted to his chosen path and , except for rare moments , never doubted it to be the right one . From the day Michael Zaslow first spoke to him about Chai , he had tried to keep from second-guessing himself . The decision had been his to make and he had made it quickly . But it was sometimes hard not to wonder where and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never thought of himself as especially dedicated or courageous , but he knew his parents did . Which was one of the reasons he had gone into it in the first place . What did a sweaty adolescent know about life decisions ? If you loved and respected your parents , you just figured out what they 'd most likely want you to do and you did it . After that , if you were lucky , you worked into it . If , under interrogation , Arthur Rabin was ever forced to go into detail about the precise sequence of steps which made him a thirty-seven-year-old Protestant FBI agent named George Lewellyn in the autumn of 1966 , he would have felt he was describing the adventures of a role which he , as a young actor , had been assigned by central casting . Although his metamorphosis into Lewellyn was almost technically perfect , he always felt a kind of insanity on every breath . Where other men took the love in their homes for granted , he wallowed in secret doubts . His son was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife feel about the hidden Arthur Rabin ? It was not an unexpected problem . When he had originally considered marrying , he had discussed it with Michael Zaslow . " I think I 'd like to get married , " he told him . " Would it be okay ? " " If it 's what you want . We would n't try to deprive you of a family . Just be sure you understand what you 'll be getting into . " " I think I do . " Zaslow looked at him . " I assume she 's not Jewish . " " Presbyterian . " " You 'll never be able to tell her , you know . " Lewellyn nodded . " And you 're willing to raise your children as Christians ? " " I do n't believe Marilyn has a prejudiced cell in her body . If she 42  | turned out this well as a Christian , I 'd be willing to risk it with my kids . " " You 're thinking calmly and unemotionally now . There 'll be times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Children pick up things from their friends . Yours might come home one day screaming about dirty Jews . " " I 'll have to take that chance . " Zaslow smiled . " You must really love your Marilyn . " " More than I ever thought I could . " He hesitated . " Are there many others like me ? I mean , who have married ? " " Some . " " How have they turned out ? " " Good and bad . But that 's no help . In the end , you 're still going to have to deal with it yourself . " True . But there were moments when Lewellyn would very much have liked to speak with those others . Which was impossible , since he did n't know who they were . Fine for security but very lonely for him . It was like functioning in a vacuum . Even after nineteen years , he had only the vaguest idea of Chai 's scope . Michael Zaslow was his sole contact . He received instructions from him , reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked , years before , whom he was to contact if anything were to happen to Zaslow , he was told that all such contingencies were taken care of and that someone would contact him . Yet even now , it was hard for him to imagine there not being a Michael Zaslow . To Lewellyn , the Professor was Chai , and had been since the day , in 1946 , his father had brought him home , a tall , angular man with a crooked smile and steady eyes . He had been wounded during the last days of the war in Europe , and when I ewellyn first met him , his left arm was still being held together by a metal and leather brace . He had also been a war hero , one of the select few awarded the Medal of Honor , and , at eighteen , Lewellyn had been impressed . At thirty-seven , he still was . Zaslow himself had never been . " I just got good for five minutes once , " he said . " You 43  | have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really mean anything . " Still , he had done what not many ever had , so you listened to him with extra care . When he began speaking of Chai there was instant fire and Lewellyn felt that . " The thing is , " Zaslow had said , speaking quietly and reasonably , a home-style lecturer on genocide , " we ca n't ever let ourselves be lulled again . Even now , with the ovens still standing witness , I read the newspapers , I listen to the radio , I hear people talking , and I could weep . You know why I could weep ? Not because they 're still lying and trying to hide the truth , but because the lies are so weak , so contemptuous . They say whatever they want because they know the kind of trusting fools we are . We accept whatever assurances anybody chooses to hand us . We 're ready to die for whatever insane reason they happen to think up between breakfast and lunch . Good God , we 're so stupid we 've been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , like a continuous showing in the movies . " Zaslow stared at the eighteen-year-old Arthur Rabin . " But not anymore , " he said in his low , even voice . " Some of us have finally learned . Never again will we depend on their assurances . We 're making our own . No more trust . We have to act before they act . Once they move , it 's too late . We must know their plans , even anticipate them . Then whatever has to be done , we must do it . " Michael Zaslow 's face was sorrowful , almost pleading . " You 're an intelligent young man . One of our finest . Your father has told me all about you . And we need your help . We need the help of a great many like you . All through the United States , all through Europe , South America , Asia , the plan is taking form , people are being recruited . If you 're interested in helping , if you ... " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure this tall stranger , this gallant war hero that whatever he and his parents wished him to do , he would do . " Sure I 'm interested . " " My dear boy . . . " Zaslow shook his head patiently and a little sadly . " You ca n't say sure to anything until I tell you more . And maybe not even then . " He was only ten years older than Arthur , but seemed a hundred . " It is n't that simple . It will mean changing your 44  | life . . . your name , your religion , everything . It will mean living a constant lie . Seemingly , you 'll be a Christian , yet you 'll be performing for us as a Jew . You 'll not only be our eyes and ears at crucial moments , but our insurance as well . Because regardless of what happens to the rest of us , you 'll still be out there . It will mean betraying those you 've worked with for years and grown to care about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jews . I do n't enjoy saying it , but trust has become a luxury we can no longer afford . I know there are good and bad Christians just as there are good and bad Jews , and it 's terribly unjust to lump them all together as potential enemies . But if survival depends on it , then a little injustice is a small price to pay . " Nineteen years , and George Lewellyn had paid that allegedly small price many times over . And he was still paying . Though sometimes in different ways . Motivation was not always pure . Magic , dread , and the fascination of death were also incentives . The worst of discoveries was made . Violence had exhilaration in it . Not that it was a state to live with continually . The tension in your body made you sicken after awhile . But , held briefly , you soared . Then it became a lonely landscape , with hurt , frightened voices calling in the dark . The voices he was hearing now , on the tape , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite relaxed . As recorded in their bedroom , Charles Brandenburg and his wife were discussing the day 's events in much the same way as millions of other couples preparing for bed . There was nothing to shake the earth , just casual chatter about family and friends , the dinner party they had attended earlier , a plumbing problem that needed attention . The bedroom conversation of the world 's leaders would make poor copy for historians . No great poetic truths were to be extracted from these torrents of homey talk . And the self-consciousness caused by the knowledge that every word was being recorded only made it worse . Nevertheless , Brandenburg was handling it well , showing just a few barely noticeable signs of his awareness . And surprisingly , his wife was doing even better . Listening carefully , Lewellyn could detect no false phrasing or enunciation , no rushed breathing . She sounded so natural , in fact , that it began to bother him . He slowed the tape and 45  | raised the volume , but she still sounded too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided , or she did n't know she was being taped . Only when husband and wife went to bed later and Lewellyn heard , fiercely and uninhibitedly , those small intimate cries of passion that no reasonably modest woman would ever consciously share with a tape recorder , did the answer become clear . For some reason , Brandenburg had failed to tell his wife a thing . 46  | On the morning of January 16 , 1967 , Michael Zaslow was delivering a lecture at Columbia University in New York . It was one of about two dozen such talks he would be giving that year at various colleges around the country . He had not held a regular teaching post since before the war , but had continued as a visiting lecturer since this allowed him to be seen and heard as he wished to be seen and heard . Every occasion had its propaganda . People , too . You had an idea , a conviction , a wish , and you disseminated it . If you were good enough , if your words took , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his own case , Zaslow , a doctor of political science , an author of scholarly tracts on prejudice , a Jew , tried to make it known to thinking audiences everywhere , that if the earth deserved to be abandoned , that if they were all finally to be driven streaming into other worlds ( perhaps starting with the moon ) the disaster was not wholly to be blamed on those few poor , benighted , long-suffering tribes of Israel . But faced with large auditoriums crowded with receptive listeners , Michael Zaslow had his own small weakness swelling and bulging inside him . He wanted to confess . He yearned to admit he was not nearly as confident and certain as he seemed , that he had only questions and not a single significant answer in which he truly be-47  | lieved . He longed to reveal to all those attentive faces that he frequently woke in the night with a noise inside his head , that his torn arm had never really healed properly or left him free of pain , that staring into early-morning mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles under his eyes . It was all repressed , of course . This was not his chosen propaganda line . Yet standing up there on the platform in that warm , expectant silence , there was always a confusing , frowning moment when he was not quite sure what to tell them . And what was he telling them today ? What new and startling solutions was he peddling ? No solutions . Only a brief time-trip back to fifth century Persia , to those unblessed followers of Manicheus and their classic doctrine of good and evil . As applied to the twentieth-century Jew , naturally , and his inseparable companion , the anti-Semite . What was one without the other ? . . . Damon without Pythias . Finally , he told them , it was all metaphysical . The Jew was just basically evil . Metaphysical forces drove him to evil . Which put him on a par with only one creature ; Satan himself . So the Jew became the anti-Semite 's own private Devil . It was through him that all evil , all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't spring from clashes of national interest , but because the Jew was there , belching evil . If there was class struggle , it was n't because of injustice or economics , but because the Jew had gotten to the workers . Metaphyics . At bottom , anti-Semitism was pure Manicheism , defining the course of the world in terms of the battle between the forces of Light and Darkness . And no armistice was possible . One must win , the other be destroyed . The anti-Semite 's vision of the universe was catastrophic . So long as the Jew was everywhere , the earth was ruined . The total destruction of the Jew was his only solution . And during this , the most enlightened of all centuries , he had almost succeeded in bringing it about . Zaslow 's theory . Clearly enunciated , even-toned , it sailed across the crowded auditorium on wings of metaphysical logic . He was an authority here , on this podium , a respected man of letters to whom hundreds of Aryans and a few Jews listened politely , acceptingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all saints in some new and 48  | as yet nameless religious order ? Had they reached the point in evolution at which the options were reduced to sainthood or madness ? At times , Zaslow believed so . More often , he knew it was the strength to do what you had to do daily and promptly and without complaint that made the true saints and heroes . Still , they had hung a medal about his neck for a different reason and made another sort of hero out of him , even a symbol . But a symbol of what , he did n't know . Unless it was the image of him as an intellectual , who could also be trained to kill with exceptional proficiency . He did not stay long after the lecture . He usually enjoyed the questions , the student adulation , the coeds with their nubile heat , all moving flesh and shining eyes , the flattering deference of the faculty . Ego food , and he was not immune . Lord , my days are vanity . But he broke away fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office , high in the midtown tower of Galatea Press , an international publisher on whose payroll he was carried under the vague title of editorial consultant . Once at his desk , he worked alone with material from a concealed wall safe . There were rosters , reports , messages , plans , all coded and all having nothing to do with the publishing business . Then he called in Howard Mercker , Galatea 's president and chief executive officer , and they went over the more immediate action areas together , covering everything from grave desecration in New Jersey to Klan activity in Alabama , to the newest chapter of the American Renaissance Party being set up in Illinois . They also allocated special funds for rebuilding the burned out synagogue in Cleveland and establishing a scholarship for the dead malamud 's grandson . In this work , despite Mercker 's titles , Zaslow was clearly in command . Not that compliance came easily to the company president . A slim , neat man with sharp intelligence , he could be stubborn , cold , and dangerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty-four countries . Still , he had been a true sword and friend to Michael Zaslow for more than twenty years , since they had first slogged together through France and Germany in that primal vendetta of killing , that insane contest of who could bury the most Germans . It was a duel that Zaslow had finally won , but not through 49  | any greater talent . He had simply been that small , necessary bit more insane at the time . Accepting no calls , they worked without pause through most of the afternoon , following an operating manual as complex , precisely conceived , and disciplined as that of a well-run central intelligence agency . The Washington reports were saved for last . They showed that during the past week the number of surveillances had risen to five , the latest two being Congressmen and , like the others , Jews . Zaslow arranged to have them warned , then sat back , staring at the cluster of coded messages . Mercker lit a fresh cigar and watched him . Zaslow 's eyes were troubled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said at last . " That makes five we know about . But what bothers me even more are those we do n't know about . How many of those are there ? And why ca n't we trace the source any higher than the Bureau ? " " Is n't the Director 's office high enough ? " " Not for this . Even he would n't go this far on his own . " " Which leaves only God , " said Mercker . " And the President . " Mercker looked at him . " Think about it , " said Zaslow . " He 'd never do it . It would be political suicide . " " Not if it could n't be traced to him . " " What would his motives be ? " " The usual for something like this . Diversion . His little Asian war is heating up and getting out of hand , and so are the protests . He needs a diversion badly . And what could be better than a nice antiwar conspiracy led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But he appointed Brandenburg himself He 's closer to him than anyone . " Zaslow shrugged . " It 's nothing personal . Some of his best friends are Jews . But he 's also one of the most pragmatic politicians ever to sit in the White House . What finally works , he 'll do . " He thought for a moment . " Who knows ? He may even have appointed him for this reason . "  | Mercker said nothing . He had a strange face , expressionless and gray , the color seeming to have left it long ago in a moment of extreme fright . It was not an especially attractive face , but looking at it now , Michael liked it enormously because it was dependable and could be trusted . " I know it all sounds pretty farfetched , " said Zaslow , " but I do n't think it should be dismissed as a possibility . At least not until we come up with something else . " " Do we tell Brandenburg ? " " God , no ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others in Washington should be alerted . " It was late evening when Zaslow finally went home . He lived on lower Riverside Drive , in an old building that still faced the river with a stubborn faded elegance . Entering the lobby , he waited for the elevator beside a tall , somewhat awkward girl he had seen before . She wore flat-heeled shoes , perhaps to reduce her height , and her features seemed to waiver somewhere between plainness and beauty . He nodded and she smiled . " Good evening , Dr. Zaslow . " " Good evening . " Surprised she knew his name , he looked at her more closely and found she was no longer a girl . Closer to thirty , he guessed . " I heard you speak at Columbia this morning . " " Oh ? Are you student or faculty ? " " Neither . I work in the university library . " " I see , " he said , feeling less than brilliant . " I 'm afraid I found your lecture very disturbing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you said ? " He laughed . She was embarrassed . " I did n't mean that the way it sounded . It 's just that I know speakers sometimes say things for dramatic effect . To make a point . I just wondered . . . " She stopped . " I 'm making it worse , are n't I ? " " Only a little . " 51  | The self-service elevator arrived and he followed her in and pressed his floor button . " What floor , Miss ... ? " " Burrows , " she said . " Kate Burrows . I 'm on twelve , please . " The doors closed and they clanked slowly upward . " What was it you found so disturbing , Miss Burrows ? " She hesitated . " Well , " she said , " when you pointed a finger at your anti-Semite , I felt you were accusing everyone there who was not a Jew . Myself included . You threw us all in the same pot , because anti-Semitism led straight to Nazism , which led straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passive complicity . At worst , you made murderers of us all . " The elevator stopped at Zaslow 's floor , the tenth , and he stepped out but held the doors . " I 'm sorry , " he said again . " No , you 're not . Not really . Why do you keep saying that ? " He smiled . " Just to be polite . " The answer seemed to annoy her . " That 's not being polite . It 's being patronizing . " " I suppose it is . But it 's a little hard to cope with you seriously while holding back a pair of elevator doors . " " You do n't really have to cope with me at all . All you have to do is let go of the doors . " She stood very straight in her heel-less shoes and was almost as tall as he . " Good night , Dr. Zaslow . " " Good night , Miss Burrows , " he said and watched the elevator and the overaged , faintly lovely girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms that were once taken for granted in New York 's better buildings , but it was the view he loved most ; the wide stretch of the river and the Palisades on the far bank . This was where he enjoyed looking . To look out at other buildings , at the brick and stone and window curtains of their attempted permanence , was sad . He had been in this apartment a long time , had lived here with his wife and stayed on after she died . He had few possessions other than his books and hardly noticed the worn furnishings . A woman came in to clean twice a week , but he rarely saw her and sometimes she left little notes reminding him to buy things . I really have no home , he sometimes thought ; I live in a burrow , like a small animal .  | As he came in , the apartment felt cool and musty , like a place not lived in for years . He had been out of town for just two weeks and the air was already that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hall , bent over a little , as though weighted under the pressure of the walls themselves . In the bedroom he stripped off his clothes and padded naked into the shower . Drying himself afterwards , he caught sight of his eyes in the mirror . They looked tired and dark and curiously alien , the eyes of an aging stranger . Then ritually , as if to forget even once would be a breach of contract , he explored the network of scars that ran half the length of his left arm , tracing the ridges with the tips of his fingers , feeling the dull , familiar ache at the elbow . He put on a clean shirt , chinos , and a pair of scuffed loafers . He did not own a robe or slippers . These were for sickness or lounging , and he was never sick and never lounged . The refrigerator held a patchy assortment of leftovers . He picked out some hardening cheese , put it on a stale slice of rye , and ate it with a tall scotch and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed it . He had just finished eating and was pouring a second drink when the doorbell rang with startling volume . He glanced at his watch , but the action was pure reflex . The time meant nothing . His bell rarely rang at any hour . He opened the door and stared at the long , slightly flushed face of Kate Burrows . " I 'm very stupid , " she said . " I think I 'm getting more stupid every day . And tonight I 'm afraid I behaved stupidly enough for next week . " He stood looking at her . " I just wanted to apologize . " " There 's nothing to apologize for . " " But there is . My God , I was rude ! I 've thought of nothing else since you left the elevator . " " Well , then would you mind very much coming inside for your apology ? I 'm getting a little tired of holding doors while I talk to you . There was an instant 's hesitation : just enough , thought Zaslow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in. 53  | " What do you usually have to drink with your apologies ? " he asked . " Nothing , thank you . " " A touch of scotch can help just about anything . " She sighed . " All right . " He gave her the drink and waited . She had , he decided , one of those distinctly American faces , a small-town girl 's face with the chiseled , open features and fair complexion that have haunted the erotic fantasies of adolescent Jewish males for a thousand years . But it also had a quiet , remote little air you wondered about and were sure held something even better in reserve . " The thing was , " she said carefully , " I resented what you did to me in that auditorium this morning . I do n't like feeling guilty and that was exactly the way you made me feel . I do n't like carrying a ton load of history on my back and that was exactly what you dumped on me . So when I tried speaking to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I overreacted . And for that , I 'm sorry . " " Does that complete your apology ? " She nodded . " Good . " She walked slowly about the room , studying pictures , furniture , the view from the high , old-fashioned windows . Zaslow watched her . It was strange , seeing a woman there . He was far from celibate , but the women he knew , he preferred seeing elsewhere . He played a part much of the time and there were psychological dangers . A certain amount of deception was necessary simply for self-defense . He had to be on guard against even the most natural of impulses . And where a man lived , he was most vulnerable . She seemed to sense it . " I feel like an intruder here . " He said nothing . " Would you like me to leave ? " " No . " " Would you tell me if you did , or would you just be polite again ? " " I 'd probably be polite . "  | She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling yellowgreen . " You 're really a very kind man , are n't you ? " " I do n't enjoy hurting people , if that 's what you mean . " " No . I mean you 're kind . " " All right . " " It 's not such a terrible thing . " " I did n't say it was . " " No , but you looked offended , as if I had somehow insulted your masculinity . " " Now you 're being presumptuous . " Her gaze was steady , bold , quietly mocking . " Am I ? " It was a simple , transparent little sexual overture , but the mood and the bait were pleasant and he found himself responding . What a curious girl , he thought . Standing beside her , he seemed to feel not one presence , but two . . . an uncertain , reserved , almost shy young woman of cool shadows and private ghosts , and then the other girl , flirtatious , teasing , the kind who regarded sex as a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having to bend only slightly , kissed her . She showed nothing . " That was nice . " " You damn me with faint praise , " he said and kissed her again , but differently this time , and a taste of something sweet and strong came off her mouth and told of what she knew , of small Midwestern towns and large eastern cities , of coolness mixed with raw promise , so much that he closed his eyes and found it slightly dizzying . She held him as if to keep from falling herself . " What do you want from me ? " he said to her hair . " What are you offering ? " " Without commitment ? " " Of course . " She was smiling , though he could n't see . " I would n't be that presumptuous . " Why not ? . . . he thought , aware of that strange mixture of promise and respect that often came with such gifts . The reasoning and logic could be held for later . Right now it was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be feeling the same sweet way he felt . 55  | She was a prize in bed . Neither shy nor bold , some cool sense of his needs lived in the turn of her flesh . How could he have thought her awkward ? She was exquisite . Yet at one point , something cold tore loose in him , as if he knew there was no such thing as a gift , that you got nothing for nothing and that one way or another , you paid . So that in a silent scream of dismay , he opened his eyes . Her face was pure gold beneath his in the lamplight , her eyes alive and shining with him , and the scream dissolved to a whisper . He ordered a security check on her the next morning and had the report in his hands three days later . She was thirty-two years old and had been born and raised in Battle Creek , Michigan , the eldest of four children , two of whom had died in a fire sixteen years before . Her father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her surviving brother an employee of the Kellogg Company . She had a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Library Science degree from Northwestern University , and had been employed by the Columbia University Library for the past two years . In 1957 she was married to Lawrence Gladding , an electronics engineer , and lived in Boston until she won an uncontested divorce , in 1962 , on the grounds of adultery . Her religion was Episcopalian , but she had not attended church on a regular basis since going to college . She was a registered Democrat and a contributor to several pacifist and moral rearmament types of organizations , one of which was currently under investigation by the FBI . She had no police record and had never been fingerprinted by any government law-enforcement agency . She had been under intensive psychiatric treatment from age fourteen to sixteen , was confined briefly during that time , but had not been under treatment since . During the period of her marriage , she had a medical history of three miscarriages and no births . She was well regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a more responsible position . She appeared to have a generally casual relationship with a small number of friends and had no visible romantic attachments . She had been living in her present apartment for five and a half months and had little contact with the other tenants in the building .  | Chronologically , the only period unaccounted for was from June of 1962 to May of 1963 . During this time , there was no visible record of where she had lived or worked . On the report , this was circled in red . Also circled in red was the fact that the Riverside Realty Corporation , which managed the building in which she now lived , had rented her an apartment two weeks after receiving her application , although there had been a considerable waiting list ahead of her .  | There was nothing unusual about Michael Zaslow 's ordering a security check on Kate Burrows . Such things had become routine , an almost automatic reaction to anyone showing more than a casual interest in him . Still , he had not always been this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had taken a long , hard process of conditioning to change him . The process had begun on the morning of April i8 , 1945 , under the pale , spring sun of western Germany . Zaslow could pinpoint the time as specifically as that . As commander of the division 's lead company , he had been among the first into what Corps Intelligence had designated as Objective 3 . Entrance had required no fighting . The SS guards had left the camp several hours before . There were just the dead , the dying , and the walking skeletons to greet them . At the end , the guards had evidently butchered an extra few thousand as a farewell gesture , but had not taken time to dispose of the bodies . The Germans were an efficient people , and the killing had , typically , gone well , but body-disposal was always a problem . Stripped naked , these were stacked in piles , like cordwood . But occasional sound and movement still came from the piles , and the living had to be dug out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept . Zaslow did neither . All he did was his job . He had the survivors fed from his  | company 's rations , the sick and wounded treated , and the dead buried . They were almost all Jews . Then he found a rabbi and had him conduct a memorial service . With all the thousands who had died in the camp , it was the first such ceremony ever held there . Throughout it all , Zaslow maintained an air of careful reserve . He clung to it the way a shipwrecked sailor might cling to a piece of flotsam in a lonely sea . He was afraid to let it go . He did not know what might come to take its place . It was not until several days later , when his company was once more fighting Germans , that he found out . What came was a very fine madness . Of course they did not call it that . They called it extreme heroism . But Zaslow had no illusions about the terminology . He knew what he was . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abyss . His hate , that day , smothered all normality , all thought , all fear of death . So that in his eagerness to avenge , he had Icd his men into an enfiladed position in an old cemetery from which they could neither advance nor retreat . The rawest second lieutenant should have known better . Pinned down in an exposed line , seeing his lead platoon about to be picked apart by a pair of machine guns directly ahead , and by rifle and mortar fire from their flanks , he was quite prepared to die in penance . And by any logic , what he did next should have insured it . For he suddenly abandoned all cover and dashed straight up that tombstone-studded slope , not even bothering to rig-zag but just running like a maniac , his machine pistol slung over one shoulder and both hands working at the grenades , pulling and throwing , pulling and throwing , a madman at a carnival in hell , grabbing at merry-go-round rings and tossing fireballs . I n considering it later , he was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had somehow conspired to keep him from being torn apart that day . Because whatever could possibly have gone right for him during those few moments did go right . The sun broke blindingly out of the heavens behind him , the gunners were startled enough by his lunacy to throw off their fire , his grenudes exploded precisely where they should have , about five feet shove each emplacement , and if the skies themselves had opened and rained steel , the shower could not have been more deadly . 59  | Then , still running , he had the machine-pistol off his shoulder and into his hands , ( a Schmeisser he had lifted from a dead German ) feeling it spit at the smoking earth that smelled of cordite and burnt flesh , at the faces that rose up out of it , mother-loving German faces , with mouths open and blood and dirt darkening the skin . He kept his finger on the trigger and the faces flew off like birds leaving a nest . There were eight of them in the two emplacements , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , just running and firing and watching them go down like tumbling clowns ; one retching blood , another with carnage below his neck , a third yelping for his mother out of some dim memory of the womb . Until finally there was only one left , and he , the last , knelt there in the dirt with a pistol in his hand and one arm half off , knelt there and aimed his pistol at Zaslow as calmly as if he were a target in a shooting gallery . He had pale blue eyes and Zaslow , who was only fifteen feet away by then , saw them above the pistol , saw that clear , icy blue that went all the way back to Attila , saw it all right there , silently screaming Jude at him and knew , finally and for all time , that there had never been , nor would there ever be any hope of change . The German pulled the trigger ( Zaslow actually heard the click ) but the pistol did not fire . Only Zaslow 's Schmeisser went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion that , curiously , did not come from the machine-pistol in Zaslow 's hands , but out of a mortar shell from farther down the line . And Zaslow felt himself lifted in a roar that started white and went red , and felt the tearing in his arm as he went down . Then his men were up and around him , shooting apart what was left of the center and hitting the flanks as well . But lying in the dirt , all Zaslow could see were those pale , hating eyes staring into his . And for that particular madness , he was called a hero and officially sanctified by America 's highest military award . More importantly , he was allowed to keep what remained of his left arm . For a long stretch , that had been in some doubt . But by the time he was through with hospitals , the war was several months over and he was left to walk about with his new title of hero , his arm in a steel and leather brace , and the cold certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . In his mind there was a chill , blue haze  | to everything , a chill , blue light in the sky . In this light , there was only bad news . It drained meaning from everything and left him dry . All he could think of were cordwood skeletons and two eyes over a pistol . He had never been a metaphysical thinker , nor a believer in portents and symbols . He was an intellectual , a believer in the power of reason . Yet how did reason explain his survival on that German hill ? And if it could n't , what could ? God ? Or was it perhaps some indeterminate force with a different name , that had somehow kept t hose machine guns and that carefully aimed pistol from killing him ? And if so , why ? For what possible purpose ? He had no answers , of course . Nor , during all his months of pondering , in hospitals and out , did he come near to finding any . But t he questions remained , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordinary human being and wanted again to feel and act like one . Did n't he have a right to be himself once more ? ... to relax into old work , old routines , old interests ? He had a wife and a teaching job waiting for him , an interrupted life to pick up . Why was he molesting himself with abstract issues ? He was no philosopher or rabbi . He had been a political science professor and , more recently , a soldier . Now , he did n't know what he was . Had he become something else merely because he had looked into the abyss and survived ? Was he thus changed ? Evidently . Out of the hospital and on medical leave , and with a wife waiting at home , he remained in Europe . He roamed the displaced-persons camps and ruined cities , searching out those skeletons with tattoos , the survivors . He had witnessed only a small fragment - of it . The numbers were still coming in and they muddled the mind . You heard snakes rustle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it . You had to hear more . You had to see . So he heard and saw and at the end of six months , having spared himself nothing , he believed it . It was all true . Clots had evidently formed in the passages of the human heart . Defective from the beginning , worn thin by ages of abuse , they had finally burst . The whole mortal jelly trembled . It shivered on the edge of the black . Any additional pressure could cause another break , could again spray blood . And unless treated , it would happen . It was just a question  | of time and place . The facts shuddered their way into Michael Zaslow 's brain . They were irrefutable . When he was at last able to accept them , when he had decided what he was going to do , he went home . It was a curious homecoming . He had been married less than a month when he was shipped overseas and had known his wife only three months before that . Now , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dimly remembered ghost . " What have they done to you ? " Madelaine wept when she saw him , and it was not only his arm that she meant . He had written regularly , but the letters were just generalized reassurances , with no mention of the dying and the horror . And he had been careful not to send any photographs of himself . The anguish of his face was no decoration for the dressing table of a pretty young girl who served doughnuts at USO dances and taught six-year-old children in school . He was able to tell her some of it when she questioned him , but not all . There were still things he was not ready to talk about . Nor did he mention anything of what he intended to do . Too much had to be thought through first and he wanted no one influencing his judgement . Which he knew was unfair , since her life was involved as well as his own . But this was the way he chose to do it , working alone in a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper , first in concept , then in outline , then working out every detail and possible contingency . It was three months before the finished plan evolved . Then having spent another few weeks checking it out , Zaslow felt he was ready to go . And where he went was to Howard Mercker . Zaslow had not seen his friend since Germany , but had telephoned him soon after he arrived home . " I 'm going to need your help in a few months , " he had told him . " Can I count on it ? " " You know you can , " said the voice on the phone . There were no questions . When the time came and they met , Zaslow handed him a twentypage outline . Mercker read it through in silence , then just sat looking at him . " All right , " he said at last . " What do you want me to do ? " Three weeks later , on the evening of February 13 , 1946 , fifteen men were gathered in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Howard 's father . He was also board  | chairman of Galatea Press , a director of seven corporations and three banks , and a ranking officer of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith . It was upon his personal invitation and urging that most of those present had come there that evening . They had come from all over the country , and in wealth , influence , and prestige , were the acknowledged leaders of American Jewry . There had originally been four additional names on the carefully chosen list Zaslow had given the elder Mercker , but one had since died , two were in hospitals , and the fourth had disappeared in a private plane somewhere over Alaska . Until Zaslow was introduced and started to speak , only Howard and his father knew the true purpose of the meeting . " Gentlemen , " he said , " thank you for being here tonight . Unfortunately , you 're not going to have a very pleasant time of it . But I ca n't help that . Because what I 'm going to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the lights put out and proceeded to show them two hours of horror movies . The film clips had been bought , begged , borrowed , and literally stolen from American , British , Russian and German sources . Some had been filmed by liberating troops , others capt ured from the SS , still others taken by Zaslow himself . Altoget her , they added up to a collection of calamity and evil that few had seen before , or ever would again . Bits and pieces would later be shown to the American public , but even these excerpts were carefully edited , the sensibilities of Americans being considered too delicately balanced , too unprepared , too attuned to the Walt Disney view of life to he exposed to such uncensored reality . But for those gathered there t hat night , Zaslow held back nothing . Only when the last ovens had been emptied of ash , the last skeletons buried , did he turn on the lights once more . For a while , no one seemed able to look at anyone else . Survival guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these sleek , well-fed American Jews who between them represented unmeasurable wealth and influence , yet suddenly found themselves naked in the Are Michael got a strong whiff of the fear , could almost feel all that was bright and green draining away . It was an extinction . If they  | lived another twenty years , or even fifty , they would remember that this was the moment that death began . Zaslow stood before them again , a tall , angular young man with hard eyes and a braced arm held crookedly across his body . " So now you 've seen it , " he said . " And they were all ours . Landsleit , every one . Six million . Six million , " he repeated slowly , letting the two words sift through the large room of the Long Island mansion , " while the world sat quietly by , not believing , or not caring , or even secretly pleased . But that 's history now . We ca n't change it . And we ca n't waste time mourning and beating our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop it from happening again . Because if we do n't stop it , it will happen again . It always has . How many thousands of years and millions of murders does it take us to learn ? They almost finished us this time . If Germany had won , they would have . And next time they 'll do it . Their model has been created , and since it worked so well , it makes a repetition that much more likely . A limit was broken by the holocaust . A control is gone . The whole procedure of genocide is now better laid out and understood . It 's no longer just an insane notion . It 's become a workable fact . And unless we want to see it working again , we 're going to have to start doing something . " He breathed deeply . " So , gentlemen , let 's start doing it tonight . " The room was quiet . A few throats were cleared , but no one said anything . Yet a message came up out of the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and rode it . " Those in this room , " he went on , " were n't picked at random . You were chosen because you 're among the leaders in those areas of government , industry , finance , security , and communications most vital to our needs . Together , you represent a power base broad and strong enough to influence most aspects of American life . And because of this country 's inevitable leadership role in the years ahead , that means much of the world as well . All that 's missing is the right operating procedure , and I believe I 've worked that out . " Zaslow smiled dimly . " For a long time we 've been falsely accused of nurturing conspiracies . Now we 're actually going to have one . " He spent the next hour outlining details . An initial revolving fund of fifty million dollars would be estab-  | lished immediately under the auspices of the investment bankers in the group , with further assessments to be levied on the basis of operational needs . The bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and working capital kept in a dummy division of Adolph Mercker 's Galatea Press . Operations would originally be confined to the United States , with world-wide expansion coming only after a firm base had been established . The entire network would , of course , function undercover . All communication would be coded and through channels , and no more than five principals would ever convene at any one time . To assure growth and continuity , the names of additional principals would be submitted regularly for possible approval . Only one over-all objective would be recognized ; the survival of the Jewish people . To this end , all other considerations and judgments would be subordinated . There were questions , objections , and doubts when Zaslow was finished , but none that could n't be handled by either logic or evoking the memory of the six million dead . Zaslow learned something about wealth and power that night . Mostly , they made the fear of dying that much greater . Still , three of the group refused to make the necessary commitment and , after pledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together for three days and nights . Zaslow broke them into four committees . . . finance , security , government and industry . The operations of each section were outlined and procedures established . Each committee chose a chairman to represent them on a Central Governing Board which , in turn , chose Michael Zaslow as its own chairman . Zaslow then named Adolph Mercker as his vice-chairman , but the elder Mercker deferred in favor of his son , claiming ill health . He was , in fact , to be dead of cancer within the year . When the group finally dispersed at the end of the seventy-two hours , they were never again to meet as a complete unit . But from then on , the organization existed . Deliberately left nameless , its unofficial designation did not evolve until sometime later . Curiously , no one was ever quite sure how or when it came about , but Chai it became and Chai it remained . Even to those who never truly believed it existed at all , it was still Chai . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York offices of the Galatea Press . The size , nature , and location of the huge publishing company and its branches offered perfect cover , and as general editorial consultant , Zaslow himself had the freedom of movement he needed . He traveled a great deal during those early years ; abroad as well as in his own country . He moved fast but with caution . He was still learning . Yet he did have certain natural gifts for the work . He was able to see things with indefectible clarity and could measure , compute odds , and make necessary judgments quickly and without destructive second thoughts . The single flaw in his psychological make-up at that time was that the ground he saw and gauged and acted upon might have been that of another planet . It had no visible connection with what was actually there , with what had to be dealt with in other people 's visions of reality . Instead of a young man 's normal absorption with life and living , he was lost in a private kaleidoscope of death . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his wife had to bear it too . Poor Maddy , he sometimes thought , would have been infinitely better off had he never come home from the war . As a young , pretty widow , she would have soon forgotten him and gone on to a new and better life with someone else . As it was , she had him back , loved him , and was stuck with him . She had had so many lonely , worried years to think about her marriage , never knowing whether or not he would come back alive , that she had worked out every detail much too perfectly in her mind . She had imagined all the things they would do together , the meals she would serve , the people they would invite and who would invite them in return , the pleasant , stimulating discussions with a large circle of interesting friends , the sharing of everything with her husband , the family they would raise , the vacations they would take , the total commitment to life and love after the last sounds of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed , who left her alone much of the time and who seemed abstracted and apart even when he was with her . And worst of all , she was constantly afraid . Not for herself . She was curiously without personal fear . She was afraid for him . " They 're going to kill you , " she once told him . " They 're not going to let you get away with this . When the right time comes ,  | they 're just going to finish you and this insanity for good . " He was preparing to leave on one of his trips . It was always bad when he was about to go away , but this time it was worse than usual . " No one is going to kill anybody , " he said quietly . " You 've got to stop thinking like that . " " Do n't tell me how to think . I 'm not a fool and I 'm not a child . Why do you treat me as though I were ? Why do you pretend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pretense . " " It is ! " He said nothing and she left it alone . But when he looked at her again , she was crying and it took him the rest of the night to soothe her . Unfortunately , she had just enough knowledge of what he was doing to make the risks seem greater than they were . She was not to formally religious girl , yet carried a deep-rooted belief in the finger of ' God . Perhaps secretly she even believed in demons . In any case , there was something terribly wrong to her about the entire concept of C'hai , as though it somehow challenged divine power . God , she kit , would look out for the Jews in his own way . They were , after all , His chosen people . How could Michael dare assume His work . At best , it lacked humility . At worst , it was sacrilegious . Finally , payment would have to be made . But if such were the case , if some cosmic force did , indeed , decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out to be Michael who made it . In considering it later , in trying to sort out the various parts of what had happened , Zaslow was affected for a while by his wife 's murky intuitions , felt trapped in that same air of foul intent . For months after the incident , he would wake in the dark , dry-mouthed and sweating , feeling claws on his chest , an oppression close to strangling in his throat . Sitting up in bed , he would imagine he saw yet again the figure at the fire-escape window , amorphous and demon-eyed . Then he would wait , almost hopefully , for the flash of the gun and the explosions , wanting another chance at it , thinking it Might be different this time . Only there were no other chances , and the figure at the window was nothing more than a shadow , and no  | part of what had happened would ever be different . But that was pretty much as it had begun that night . Something , some strange sound , some instinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shape at the window . At least he thought he saw it . He felt himself awake , yet dreams were often like this . And the moon did make ghosts . Then he saw movement and hit the floor in a tangle of sheets and blankets . His lungs dry as old leaves , he clutched at the place where legs should have been , but somehow were n't . Two shots went off and he felt their hot blasts and drove forward off the floor , both hands reaching until they touched something , grabbed it and held on to what proved to be the barrel of a gun . They fought in silence . There was the sound of breathing , nothing more , a quiet pressing and straining , pulse packed against pulse in the black room with the silver ghosts . The malachamovas , Zaslow thought wildly , and wrestled with the Angel of Death in some black-biled devil 's sea . But when he lowered his head and clamped his jaws over a hand , when he felt his teeth go through flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry he heard . Then the pressure broke and the gun fell to the floor . The man went out the way he had come in and Zaslow started to follow . Then Maddy called his name and the way it sounded was enough to stop him . He went back , put on the bed lamp and saw blood all over the sheets . " Oh , God , " he said , and picked up the phone and called for an ambulance . She remained conscious . " Do n't worry , " she said . " I 'll be all right . " " Sure you will . " He pressed a handkerchief to her chest and held her . " It hardly hurts at all . " She was very pale and it seemed hard for her to breathe . " Shhh . . . You should n't talk . " " Do you know who it was ? " He shook his head . " See ? " She tried to smile . . . a wife 's satisfaction at being right . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning . " I love you . "  | " I know you do , darling . Please do n't worry about that part . " She closed her eyes . " And I 'm not really afraid . It 's just that I feel kind of cheated . " She drifted off then and he knew she must be hemorrhaging badly inside . By the time the ambulance arrived , she was dead . The police suspected Zaslow at first . He had picked up the gun , ( an unregistered Luger ) and the only visible prints were his own . Also , statistics showed that most bedroom homicides were family matters . But the testimony of several tenants who had seen the gunman fleeing , quickly cleared him and the shooting was finally recorded as the result of an attempted burglary . Zaslow was calm afterwards , but it was a dangerous , delicately balanced calm . Blaming himself , he knelt in private anguish . Apart from everything else , he had not expected so great a sense of loss . I did love her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that it was not just some new monster of deception . For days , he lived with a cold tingling in his flesh . Looking at his hands , he might have been holding a tiny casket cradled in the palms . Then something touched him and he began to consider what had to be done . The most obvious fact remained . Whoever had tried to kill him , would try again . Less obvious , was who it might be . Chai 's security was tight , but that still meant a number of people knowing who he was . All were considered trustworthy , but motives could be strange and t here was always the possibility of carelessness . He could do no more than prepare himself and wait for the next attempt . The only one he discussed it with was Howard Mercker . As second in command , he had to know . But you ca n't set yourself up as a damned clay pigeon , " he protested . " Do you have any better ideas ? " Mercker looked unhappy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . That would just delay another try . I want this over with fast " He lived with it for months , sleeping in his office for parts of each  | day and staying awake nights . In between , he watched for clues , ciphers and portents . While Maddy , so often apart from him alive , was now constantly with him dead . It was a sickness that milled through his blood . Then this , too , passed and the delicately balanced calm returned . But the man with the Luger did not , and Zaslow had to finally assume he had either lost his nerve , or , if he was a hired gun , his employer had lost his . Of course there was also the possibility that the entire incident had never been anything more than an attempted burglary to begin with , and that if he had not awakened and attacked the intruder , Maddy would still be alive . But either way , she was dead and his guilt a fist at his throat . In time , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had existed with violence and the threat of death for so long , it approached a natural state for him . And he had no illusions about the future . For as Chai took form and grew , so did the hazards . During the years immediately following the holocaust , while the world gave pious lip service to its shock and horror , the old undercurrents of prejudice remained , along with the old barriers to immigration . So that for a while it seemed the surviving Jews of Europe were doomed to wander forever over the roads and cities of the continent and the waterways of the world . When no one seemed willing or able to help them legally , Chai stepped in and did it illegally . Transportation was arranged , officials bribed , papers forged , borders crossed and old money traded for new lives . The European survivors had absolute priority . Only when the new State of Israel was able to open its doors to every Jew who wanted to go there , did Chai concentrate on matters closer to home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lunatic fringe was still poisoning the air . The establishment , though less overt , was little better . It still had its codes , its clubs , its gentlemen 's agreements , all pecking at Jewish entrails , and all giving Chai work to do . Which it did . Though always anonymously . It left all claims , all public enlightenment and persuasion to the Anti-Defamation League . Chai simply did whatever had to be done when such 70  | enlightenment and persuasion failed . In which context , the more virulent hate sheets were often burned out by fires of unknown origin . Klan leaders disappeared and were not heard from again , public corporations were hit by stock raids and takeovers that somehow resulted in greater tolerance at all levels of management , restricted institutions and enterprises increasingly found themselves bought out , dispossessed , or foreclosed , political candidates were helped to election or defeat by money and pressure applied at key points , and on occasions when the courts failed to properly carry out the mandate for which they had been created , Chai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods could be extreme , and not everyone in the organization approved of them . There were those who would have preferred a more moderate approach to policies and problems . Violence of any sort frightened them . They wanted to stay closer to the limits of the law . They wanted results without exposure to danger . At the beginning , Zaslow reasoned and argued with them . Later , he no longer bothered . He adopted a new system . He reported only Chars more temporate acts to the Central Governing Board . The rest were simply never mentioned . It proved to be an arrangement that worked out well for all concerned . Zaslow had the freedom of action he needed , and the more timid of the board-members were able to delude themselves out of conscious participation . It was just occasionally , in extreme cases , that the system ran into the kind of rouble it did during the summer of 1962 . In August of that year , four Jewish civil rights workers from New York were murdered in Alabama , and the six men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence against them . It was so flagrant a mockery of justice , that even those involved found It hard to keep straight faces for the news cameras . Three weeks later , the released killers were taken from their homes during the night , Shot once through the head , and their bodies left on the steps of the county courthouse . Their executioners were never identified , but at ? special meeting of Chai 's Central Governing Board , there were cries and accusations from those unable to live with such violent 71  | solutions to their ancient problems . Zaslow listened quietly . When they were finished , he said , " What 's the matter ? What are you so afraid of ? " He looked at them , waiting , but no one answered . " Four Jewish boys were murdered . Four clean , morally concerned kids left safe , comfortable lives to help people they did n't even know , then ended up dying for their trouble , and you think we should have just sighed and sat Shiva for them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge named Specter . " We ca n't go around dispensing justice every time someone is murdered . That 's not what we were set up for . " " Maybe not . But these were n't just any murders . These boys were n't killed because they were out-of-state civil rights workers in the South . They were killed because they were Jewish out-of-state civil rights workers . And that 's exactly what we were set up for . It was no coincidence that of all the thousands of volunteers down there this summer , the only ones killed were four Jews . They hate us down there as much as they hate blacks . And who cares about a few more dead Jews , anyway ? And who 's going to do anything about it ? Certainly not their courts . Well , gentlemen , Chai cares and Chai did something about it . And we 're going to keep on doing it until they get the idea . " He understood how his accusers on the Board felt , of course . They did n't like what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or more precisely , they would allow him to do it . Anyway , they all had their assignments . Feeling and concern for a people , paying their moral dues , taking risks , all these fine human attributes which , by the peculiar nature of what they were doing , had suddenly become criminal qualities . Technically , they were all murderers and he , Michael Zaslow , was their leader . Yet he had a strange , unsure loyalty to certain pure states . Till the war and Chai , he had simply been an educated American Jew , with leanings to the intellectual , relatively useless . He hoped that in the time alloted him , he might at least do some good . His judgement of humankind had reached its low in Germany and had been struggling upward ever since . There were still such things as human qualities and they had to be cherished . 72  | They also had to be protected from the crazies . A mystique had begun to evolve about Chai , a dim suspicion that international Jewry was up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even its name had started to be whispered about . All of which Zaslow considered a definite plus . A little fear in the right places could go a long way toward achieving respect . The world respected terror . A single tough , sun-bronzed Jew firing a machine gun during Israel 's War of Independence drew a more positive response than a dozen Nobel physicists . For two millennia , Jews had believed the recital of a chapter of the Psalms would do more to affect the course of events than killing their enemies . They had fought the world 's evil with spiritual courage and the Bible and they had paid in blood . It was time to try rifles and machine guns . And during Israel 's two wars , in ' 48 and ' 56 , as well as the years between and since , Chai had helped provide them . And it would go on providing them . Chaff 's course was set and Zaslow followed it unswervingly . Yet he was never unaware of the abnormality of his life . Sometimes he wondered whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more natural lives and goals . He would have liked to believe he was one of them , that he had his work as they had theirs , but knew better . He suspected his feelings and judgements because his life had been extreme . He had been a studious boy and young man , not intended for violence and action . Then suddenly it was all action . . . blood , guns , death . It was very brutal surgery . He could not have come out of it in one piece . He tended to see things with a curious hardness , to brush aside ordinary motives and reactions and simplify everything savagely . First came Chai and the Jewish condition , then came everything else . He had to ask himself savagely simple questions , such as , " Should they be killed ? Will they kill me ? If I lie down to sleep , will I ever get up ? " He came to think of himself as marked for violent death , accepted it and lived his life accordingly . Uncounted Germans had shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfathomable luck had saved his skin . Then someone else had tried to kill him and killed his wife instead . And for almost eighteen years after that , he had been fighting a war without rules or armistice . Experience of this kind was deforming . It twisted you out of all 73  | natural shape . In a very specific way , he was obsessed . And sadly , he was suspicious of anyone , man or woman , who showed anything more than the most superficial interest in him . So there was nothing really surprising about his having ordered a security check on Kate Burrows . At this stage of his life , it would have been far more surprising if he hadn't. 74  | At 9:40 P.M. on Friday , March 24 , 1967 , John Hartewell was addressing a packed auditorium on the Cleveland campus of Western Reserve University . There were American flags on either side of him , a red and blue Party banner at his rear , and a row of uniformed Party guards in front of the speaker 's platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible violence , and TV cameras and reporters to record the results if they failed . Judged by A.R.P . standards , which tended to measure achievement by the amount of publicity received , the evening promised to be Hartewell 's greatest success to date . It had all been initiated months before , with Hartewell 's skillful maneuvering of the Student Union into inviting him to speak . Agree with him or not , he had argued , free speech was still as inherently American as Mother 's Day , and even the smallest voice had its right to be heard . So the invitation came , and with its announcement , so great an avalanche of protest , that it was hurriedly withdrawn . Too late . By the time the Civil Liberties lawyers had done their well-intentioned work , and injunction and appeal had countered injunction and appeal , the forces of bigotry had become the latest champions of free speech and the controversy had drawn national attention . " At this stage , " Hartewell 75  | had confided to Robert Arend , " we 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , trailing smoke , we exist . Knock us out of the sky , let our message fade in the wind , and we 're not even real . " Well , they were real enough tonight , Arend thought . Standing at parade-rest , he was at the exact center of the line of Party guards protecting the speaker 's platform . He was , in fact , their Captain , an honor that carried with it the certainty of having his head smashed first . Still , it was a mark of his rapid progress in the Party that he had been appointed at all , and he was glad to accept it as such . Not that he had found it hard to move ahead . Intellectually , he had little real competition among the membership , and Hartewell had been quick to recognize this fact . " I 'm glad you 're with us , " he had told him after his first few months . " At least you have a brain and know how to use it . Which is more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been attracting lately . Right now they serve our purpose and we need them , but it wo n't always be this way . When we 've grown , when we 've achieved a higher level of respectability , we 'll attract a better breed . And that point is n't as far off as you might think . " Hartewell seemed to enjoy speaking with him and Arend was eager to listen . Frequently , at night , when the two of them were alone at Headquarters , the Party Leader talked calmly and reflectively for hours at a time , slowly unravelling the fabric of his life for his own and Arend 's benefit , as though now , at what appeared to be a major turning point in his career , he was taking stock of himself . It grew increasingly fascinating for Arend , as he followed the oblique uncovering of a life that was becoming more and more involved with his own . The old converted mansion in Cleveland became a combination lecture hall and confessional , a place where Arend could find his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood in the light of what he heard there . " You 're not married , are you ? " Hartewell asked once . It was a purely rhetorical question . Arend 's membership questionaire had long ago given him the answer . " No. " 76  | " Ever been in love ? " " A few times . At least I think I was . " " You probably were n't . If you were , you would n't have to think . You 'd know . You 'd know the weak , sinking sensation , the draining of constructive energy . " The grey eyes blinked . " The entire process of love is ruinous to a man with any sort of ambition . Women are traps . I was caught once myself . For months I could n't think straight . All I wanted was to be with her . It was sickening . And she was n't even beautiful . She tended towards fat and had a vulgar streak too . Still , " he said thoughtfully , " she did something to me that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was strong enough to get rid of her . It was the only way . I have no respect for a man who will sacrifice himself for a woman . Romantic love is a disgrace , the sickest kind of self-indulgence . " The thin line of his mouth smiled . " I 'm glad it wo n't be standing in your way . " And another time , on a snowy night , with the city asleep outside the mansion 's leaded windows , dark and hidden in the winter cold ... " It 's important for you to understand something . I know you 're too smart to buy our Jewish line . That 's just for the animals , a clear , definable enemy for them to hate , someone to shoulder their own failures , their own responsibility for guilt . But it can work . It 's worked before . Hitler won an empire just by promising to institutionalize the pogrom . Truthfully , I 've got nothing against the Jews . In fact I love their diligence , their ambition , their brains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , a ready-made crusade just waiting to be put into motion . And we 've got the money and backing to do it . Just where the money was coming from , Hartewell never revealed , but Arend was seeing increasing evidence of it . As new branches were opened across the country , the Party 's overall expenses began running over a hundred thousand dollars a month . Forty per cent of this went to its payroll of full-time organizers , area coordinators and headquarters staffers , and about thirty per cent for printing bills . Much of the printing involved large runs of The Judaic Conspiracy , a paperback diatribe written by Harte-77  | well and based on the Czarist Russian forgery , The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion . The book supported the old theory that a secret group of powerful Jews , whom Hartewell called the Chosen , actually planned the major policies and events that controlled the lives of individuals and the movements of nations . Their alleged goal was to gain political and financial dominion of country after country until a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " It 's all fiction , of course , " Hartewell had told Arend . " All lies . But there are millions out there eager to swallow every word as fact , and I 'm happy to oblige . I 'm essentially a politician and lies are the prime tools of the political trade . If we ever told the truth , our whole political system would fall apart . We 'd all be saying the same things and people would pick their leaders for the color of their eyes . It would be a disaster . This way they can at least choose whichever lies best serve their needs . " Hartewell had smiled . " The ability to create effective lies can be the most valuable talent a politician can have . If he has n't got it , he should go into some other line of work . " Now , standing in the white glare of the television lights , Robert Arend stood listening to the latest version of the lies Hartewell so effectively created . " . . . I 'm on dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphones , his amplified voice soaring across the auditorium , " ... and I 've been there from the first moment I started telling the truth . Because the most dangerous thing a man in public life can tell the public is that Jew-Zionism is the spearhead of the anti-Christ on this earth , dedicated to the destruction of the Christian religion , the Christian population , and the governmental authority of nations that are predominantly Christian .... " There was a burst of boos and foot-stomping and Hartewell waited until it quieted . Then he continued . " But it 's all true . The enemies of Christ are determined to capture the world . Not through Communism or World Government , as some think , but through the political , financial , and military power of World Zionism . It 's shocking and frightening , and I groan aloud when I realize how ignorant 78  | the American people are about what 's really going on , about how close we are to revolutionary upheaval , with the Zionist machine hovering over us , waiting to drain our blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel . Even now , as we are being increasingly bled and distracted by our involvement in Asia , Israel is pushing forward her campaign to enslave millions of Arabs , desecrate the shrines of Christ , and precipitate an incident designed to force us into a Middle Eastern war . " Beautiful , thought Robert Arend . . . his formula for lies has almost reached the status of a set art form , like a sonnet , from long use and repetition . " Even now , " Hartewell went on , " the machinery is being prepared to force us to fight for Israel , a nation of murderers and thieves who have stolen every foot of their land , and killed or driven off its rightful owners , the Arabs . Even now , in the White House itself , we find the President 's closest advisor to be a Jew , a man out of the money chambers of Wall Street , who can not help but feel a personal stake in the fortunes of Israel , a man who has come to dominate American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department . In fact all of Washington today reeks with Zionists , who control Congress and the media and stuff their messages into the mouths of our elected officials . And it is not just a recent thing , " Hartewell declared crisply , as if he were barking orders at an assembled regiment . " It has been going on far longer than is generally realized . Most Americans are unaware that Hitler 's hostility toward the Jews originated in their leaders having pushed us into World War I on the side of the Allies . And as for World War II , we were again persuaded to die by the thousands , while the Jews fattened and got rich on our blood .... " What I should do , Arend thought , making himself stand completely immobile in the row of guards , is climb up on that stage and strangle him with my bare hands . The mixed blessings of free speech . Maybe there was a case to be made for a little nice , benevolent censorship after all . Few in the auditorium believed what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What of the less educated millions listening on TV and radio ? How much damage was being 79  | done out there ? It was the worst possible abuse of freedom of speech , yet the Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of the Party Leader 's right to air his blatant lies and bigotry . " Mr. Hartewell 's opinions are his own and pose no imminent threat to the safety and welfare of the American public , " the FCC had declared , and Hartewell had hailed the ruling as a major legal victory that guaranteed the Party 's future growth . Arend had been unable to understand the Commission 's action , until Michael Zaslow told him several key members had apparently been influenced and were currently under Chai investigation . Hartewell was going on , but Arend had heard it all before and had stopped listening . He was suddenly and abysmally weary . He felt like going home , locking the door , and writing a long essay titled , The Unexplored Beatitudes of Atheism . Perhaps the time had arrived when all religion had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or newspaper would publish it , of course , so he would have to print it himself . Maybe , he thought dreamily , he could hire a plane and drop his message over the major population centers . Pay attention , he would write . Do away with faith and the world will be better off . Religion is just too destructive an element . It does n't allow enough room for dissent . So Christians kill Jews , Protestants kill Catholics , Catholics kill Protestants , Moslems kill Mohammedans , and Mohammedans kill Hindus . And right here in the land of the free , the Puritans cut the ears off Quakers and tacked them to the church walls . Religion has turned out to be just too frightening to live with , because one way or another you were finally asked to either kill or die for it . Then increasingly loud cries rose in the auditorium and Arend braced himself to defend John Hartewell from the phalanx of angry young Jews and their friends , advancing down the center aisle for the express purpose of tearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judi Haynes had ever made love in a plane . She had , variously , made love in automobiles , on trains , in camp-trailers and mobile homes , and once , in a rare moment of 8o  | youthful improvisation , on horseback . But to have amour while soaring through the Atlantic sky at six hundred miles per hour was new to her , a sensation of something astral , a communion with cells she had never even suspected she owned . Although she felt you did n't really have amour with Philip Terrill . What you had was more of a species of psychic interplay . Dispatches went back and forth , bits of information , real and imagined , over which the brain had little control . Never had she met anyone so telepathic . If Marconi had somehow failed to invent the radio , she was sure that Philip would have been the one to do it . And after barely four months of him , she had begun to feel that she too was in touch with unseen forces , some of which she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . She had thought it her idea that he take her along , had in fact begun her campaign as soon as she learned he was going . Yet by the time he finally made the suggestion , she had the feeling he had planned to take her from the start , as if she were an open piggy-bank waiting to receive whatever coins he chose to drop in at the precise moment he chose to drop them . Still , the timing was right . Her picture was finished , she had nothing scheduled for at least several months , and she carried a violent itch to be on the move . But because there was still a great deal she did n't know , and certain things did have to be kept straight , she had asked , " What about your wife ? " The question had amused him . " My wife is a true lady . One of a vanishing breed . " " Can you just leave her behind like that ? " " Well , " he said , " Joanne and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite her and she never asks to go . It seems to work out best that way . " The true lady , however , was not that lightly considered . Whatever her other sides , and regardless of what her husband chose to say , Joanne Rochemont Terrill was still a very strong support to his ego . On the rare occasions when Terrill was depressed with himself , she seemed to rise as his greatest achievement . He was , finally , the man 8  | Joanne Rochemont had chosen from among a collection of suitors that included politicians and statesmen , financial wizards , giants of the arts , and a fair sprinkling of royalty . In a way , she had been his entry into the big time and he was alternately grateful and resentful for it . With all he had achieved on his own , his closeness to the Rochemont name still gave him inestimable leverage . And he knew it . " I 've got to be very nice to her , " he had once said with that now familiar but still confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . But it was not his wife with whom he was frolicking in the master cabin of the converted 727 . It was Judi . And it was also Judi with whom he would be touching down in a cluster of major capitals during the weeks ahead , and to whom , at odd moments , he had begun to enjoy confessing his love . Not that he needed to declare it in so many words . Usually he referred to it more obliquely , as an ultimate state of grace . He considered it separate from the physical act itself , which he more nearly classified as lust . Nothing wrong with that . He happened to enjoy and be a great believer in lust . It was just that it had little to do with grace . But apart from this and certain other attitudes , what had she learned ? What , of possible value , had she come up with so far for Michael Zaslow ? Not very much . Just fragments of phone calls , a few names , some scribbled notes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pass everything along without judgment . Training and experience had turned her into a first class information conduit . This was her specialty . She was just as content to leave the evaluating to others . The plane hit a patch of turbulence and she clung to him in the suddenly tossing bunk . " At least there 's one thing you ca n't control , " she said . " What is that ? " " The air at thirty thousand feet . " " I do n't know . Maybe I have n't truly applied myself . " Despite his seeming openness about his past , he never really 82  | He would have denied being superstitious , but it was nothing else . At times , Judi could feel him tempted , could sense his need to blow a few trumpets . All that ego building inside . It had to come out somewhere . Or was the act of love itself enough siphoning off ? Judi doubted it . He was still a man and a man was always part boy , and what boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartwheel ? " Is this a very important trip ? " she had asked , and he had not been able to resist dropping a few names from his itinerary , which ran all the way from prime ministers , to Shahs , to presidents , to reigning monarchs . " You 'll be meeting many of them yourself , " he told her , " so pack your prettiest gowns . No wash and wear , please . " She had been surprised . " You mean I 'm not to be kept hidden in bedroom closets ? " Apparently she was n't . It seemed that once you were located at a certain level , there was an entirely different set of rules . Among the gods , most common moralities and judgments were tacitly held suspended . Besides , Terrill assured her , the genuinely beautiful women of the world were welcome everywhere . He said this was one of the more universal truths . It was also , Judi had thought , one of the more gallant compliments ever paid her . She did not sleep during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm heavy across her breasts , his breathing oddly rushed and irregular . She had been fine all along , but now primitive feathers of doubt began stirring in her brain . She had some savage notion that she was not fooling him at all , that he knew precisely what she was after and that he had taken her along only to deal with her somewhere overseas . She lay trembling with the plane 's engines . There had been a time when she believed exceptional things were within her reach , that she could achieve whatever she wanted if she wanted it badly enough , but not anymore . Now the farthest of her plans depressed her , for a kind of insanity seemed to be attached to following them . Good God , she did n't even know what she was looking for ! A small hurricane of fear circled her head as she thought about possible discovery and 83  | punishment . She doubted whether she could stand much hurt . Given pain , she would probably confess anything to anybody . She had once seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been able to forget it . He had broken completely , lost all dignity and control , mewled like an infant . Finally , she supposed , no one was a hero . . . just fear and suffering flesh . And she had no illusions about Philip , should he consider himself wronged . He was a prideful , sentimental man and they were the cruelest . There was early morning fog over London as they came in , and they had to circle for forty minutes before landing . After a courteous , almost deferential customs and immigration check , a waiting limousine hurried them away from the airport . The liveried chauffeur drove in silence , the streets were wet and the big Rolls felt like a hearse . Judi opened the window beside her . She took a cooling mist of rain on her face and breathed deeply . The air was almost clear , Terrill 's hand held warmly to hers , and the doubts of the night before were beginning to burn off with the fog . Did it really matter where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong in the heavens , it would be there regardless of her own decisions . All right , she thought , but was this genuine relief , or simple confusion , or just some new rationalization ? As she considered it , Philip Terrill 's flesh turned sullen in her palm . Special Agent George Lewellyn was finding it harder each day to understand the Brandenburgs and what was taking place between them . Monitoring their tapes , he seemed to be sliding backward in his comprehensions . Yet it had started off appearing to be one of his simpler assignments . Since Brandenburg had been alerted to the bugging , Lewellyn had expected a routine job without complications or surprises . Not so . First had come the feeling that Brandenburg had not told his wife about the surveillance . Then , less than a week later , Lewellyn had made the second discovery . Recorded from the bedroom extension on March 29 , 1967 , he had monitored the follow-84  | ing transcription of a telephone conversation between Mrs. Brandenburg and an unidentified male caller . " Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hi , " said the man . " Well . . . When did you get back ? " " Last night . Miss me ? " " More than I should . How was the trip ? " " Dull . They 're all alike . Even the dialogue is the same . " " When will I see you ? " " Tomorrow afternoon ? " " What time ? " " About three . " " That wo n't give us much time . I have to meet Charles downtown at five . " " It 's better than nothing . " " All right . " " See you then . " " I love you , " she said . " Yes . But not on the phone . " " There 's no one here but the girl and she 's in the kitchen . " " I know . But it 's still not smart . " " This whole thing is n't smart . " " There are still degrees . " She sighed . " I suppose there are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye , " she said and hung up . Lewellyn had erased the entire conversation from the tape , though not from his mind . There was nothing original or startling about an adulterous affair in Washington , but this one had curious overtones . Since Brandenburg had apparently kept all knowledge of the bugging from his wife , he must have had either implicit faith in her saying nothing to compromise him , or else had known about the affair right along and , for some reason , wanted those doing the surveillance to know it also . The agent found neither possibility very convincing . Nor did Michael Zas-85  | low when Lewellyn made his report to him . " Are you going to tell Brandenburg ? " he had asked the professor . " No , " said Zaslow . " At least , not now . There 's no point in hurting anyone if we do n't have to . Brandenburg may just be trying not to worry his wife . It 's frightening for a woman to know her home is under surveillance . That may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing more than that . " But Lewellyn still found himself thinking about it . He tried to imagine how he would feel in Brandenburg 's place . The idea of his own wife 's infidelity seemed remote , yet he knew it was as possible for her as for any other woman . The fantasy stayed with him , creating a curious hurt , almost as though it were he being cuckolded . That funny word , he thought , with its comic overtones . Yet what was so funny about a husband 's betrayal ? Nothing , if you were the husband . You only laughed when it was the other guy . Except that he had no desire to laugh at Brandenburg . Instead , he felt increasingly empathetic towards him , a man who strode with such confidence and dignity through the halls of power , who labored under the weight of national burdens while another man quietly pleasured his wife . As he monitored and erased conversation after conversation between the lovers , Lewellyn searched each inch of tape for hints , clues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary pattern for such things . They apparently met on the average of once each week , usually though not always on Tuesday , but invariably in the afternoon and at the same place . Lewellyn had no idea where the place was , nor did he know the man 's name . He found this last fact especially puzzling . If Gertrude Brandenburg felt secure enough on her home phone to declare her love for a man other than her husband , why would she deliberately refrain from mentioning his name ? And it had to be deliberate . When a woman spoke with a man she allegedly loved , she instinctively wanted to say his name . It was a natural compulsion , a need to reaffirm , to personalize . If she did not say his name , there had to be a reason . Lewellyn decided to find out what it was . 86  | At 2:45 P.M. on Tuesday , April 19 , 1967 , he followed as Gertrude Brandenburg 's pale blue Mercedes left 27 Birch Mews . The sight of the German car had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw one driven by a Jew . How could they forget so quickly ? Landsleit flesh was in the upholstery , martyr 's blood in the crankcase , and the fools acted as though none of it had ever happened . No wonder the rest of the world did n't give a damn . Why should they , when not even the survivors cared . Tailing at a safe interval , Lewellyn considered the back of Gertrude Brandenburg 's head and the long patrician neck supporting it . She was a slender woman , but had a good round bottom and full breasts . Lewellyn thought of himself as a moralist , but the appearance of a woman 's breasts mattered greatly to him . Sometimes he even made character judgments on that basis . The way a woman displayed her breasts could reveal a great deal . In Mrs. Brandenburg 's case , there was a distinct leaning towards the provocative in her packaging . She wanted to be noticed . A pretty woman in her mid-thirties , . she was Brandenburg 's second wife , considerably younger than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was not because of logic , but because of its absence , that Lewellyn was following her . She led him out of Georgetown , across the Potomac , and into Arlington County . At Livingston Heights , she left the limited access highway for a secondary road , drove along this for awhile , then turned into the grounds of a red brick farmhouse that Lewellyn could just about see from the road . Driving slowly , he continued on past the entrance . There was no name on the mailbox and no number on the gate . He drove on a short distance , made a U-turn , and came back . The blue Mercedes stood empty in front of the house . Lewellyn sat watching it . The afternoon sun glinted from its chrome , glass , and painted steel . Fourteen thousand American dollars worth , he thought , and wondered exactly how many Deutschmarks that came to . When he was able to stop thinking about it , he left . It took him less than an hour to get the information he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early nineteenth cen-87  | tury brick house , three outbuildings , and forty acres , was registered in the name of Pembroke Whitfield , a career diplomat with the State Department , and currently Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs . Pembroke , Lewellyn thought . No wonder she never spoke his name . 88  | When it finally came , it came in a rush . First , Representative Arnold Block ( Dem. , Ill. ) a ranking member of the House Banking and Currency Committee , was accused of conflict of interest and criminal fraud . Five days later , the Justice Department announced that Senator Herbert Fine ( Dem. , Cal. ) was being investigated for the possible misuse of a hundred thousand dollars in campaign funds . And eight days after that , Theodore Breitel , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Analysis , was charged with having revealed classified material to an official of a foreign government . All three men were outspoken critics of the Vietnam War , and all three men were Jews . Shortly thereafter , the Senior Senator from Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this time it was the presidential advisor who had requested it . They met at the same motel outside Washington . It was a different room , but the furnishings were identical to the furnishings of their first meeting room . There was even the Napoleon brandy and snifters , and Brandenburg was half way through his first drink when Zaslow arrived . They passed over the amenities quickly and Brandenburg said , " Why have n't I heard from you ? I thought I 'd have had some word by now . " 89  | " I told you I could n't put a timetable on it . " " Then I 'm still under surveillance ? " Zaslow nodded . " And you still do n't know who ordered it ? " " We have an idea . " Brandenburg 's eyes showed a hint of life . " Who ? " " The President . " Brandenburg stared at him . " You 're sure ? " " No . We 're not sure at all . But there are indications . " " What indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For Gods sake , Zaslow ! " " I 'm sorry . There are others involved . You 'll just have to take my word for it . " He paused . " Does this really come as such a surprise ? Have n't you had any suspicions of your own ? " " I suppose you reach a point of suspecting everyone . " Brandenburg smiled . " Your paranoia is contagious . " " Does what happened to Block , Fine , and Breitel in a two week period seem like paranoia ? " " No . That 's why I asked to see you tonight . There 's suddenly too much happening that I do n't understand . " Zaslow poured himself a drink and waited . " You spoke of indications before , " said Brandenburg , " and that 's probably as good a word as any for it . I 'm as close to the President as I 've ever been , yet I know there 's a difference . It may be only an occasional shifting of emphasis or change in priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago . I feel almost as though I were being hunted in the dark , and I do n't especially like the feeling . " " Well , there 's nothing much to like . " " But he appointed me himself . I do n't understand it . " " Neither do we . But you 're still in the Oval Office every day . You still see and hear things that might fill in vital gaps for us . Also , you know the man . What he is . His personal and political philosophies . When you know what a man stands for , you 're half way to knowing what he 's likely to do and why . " 90  | Brandenburg shook his head . " That 's part of the trouble . It 's hard to know what he stands for . I do n't think he knows himself . He has no true principles . They change with necessity . He acts , rather than thinks . He calls himself a political man and says it with great pride . He brags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time and win elections . And he does have that talent . Yet he does n't even realize that this implies the total absence of a guiding commitment to anything other than victory . " " What about his commitment to the Vietnam War ? " " Even in that . Since he believes the majority of American voters would n't accept a defeat , he 's getting in deeper every day . And when he 's criticized for this by an activist minority , he attacks them as leftwingers or bleeding-heart intellectuals . " " And perhaps as Jews ? " A smile came off Brandenburg 's lips but not his eyes . " You forget . I was one of those who originally urged him further into this war . " " And how do you feel about it now ? " " I believe a reassessment has to be made . " " Have you told him this ? " " Yes . " " And ? " Brandenburg sat for a moment . " Since the United States has never yet lost a war , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . At least not until the mood of the electorate instructs him differently . He 's a strangely insecure man . Neither his political nor personal triumphs have given him enough confidence or professional serenity to do the unpopular thing . I know he genuinely respects my judgment , but when that judgment goes against an opinion poll , he 'll follow the pollsters . And it 's that insecurity that worries me most . Under enough pressure , it could push him to do anything . " " You mean like putting his most trusted advisor under surveil-lance ? " " I suppose so , " said Brandenburg and his eyes were remote . " It would be his style . He dislikes dealing head-on with anyone he feels 91  | may be opposing him or his policies . He considers all opposition a violent challenge . Not only to him personally , but to the respectability of his office and his political future . Then having exaggerated the menace , he counterattacks accordingly . So that there always seems to be one more threat to his authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome , some new advantage to be gained or potential disadvantage to be avoided . The question most often asked in the Oval Office when criticism arises , is not , How should we sell the critics on the rightness of our idea ? ' But rather , How do we deal with them ? ' And since Block , Fine , and Breitel are among the most active critics of his intensifying role in the war , it 's not too unlikely that the Justice Department was sent after them for that reason . I know you feel it has more to do with their being Jews than anything else , but that 's something I still ca n't quite accept . And that goes for my own surveillance as well . Whatever else the President is , he 's no anti-Semite . " " I never said he was . But you just admitted he has no true principles , that his beliefs change with political necessity . Which would n't preclude his using anti-Semitism if the situation called for it . Brandenburg sipped his drink and said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've also spent some time studying our President , and I believe you 've figured him right . He 's a man of action rather than contemplation , a tactician rather than a theologian , a student of technique who is impatient with substance . And since he does seem to spend as much effort on neutralizing or destroying his enemies as he does on winning friends , and since an inordinate number of Jews do appear to be in the forefront of the antiwar movement , it all adds up to more than can reasonably be ignored . " " Which means what ? " Zaslow shrugged . " Nothing earth-shaking . It 's still just supposition . I 'm afraid all we can do is wait until we have something really conclusive . " " Wait ? " said Brandenburg . " While my wife and I stay locked under twenty-four-hour surveillance ? " 92  | " I 'm sorry . I know it 's not pleasant . But I do n't see that we have much alternative . " " Perhaps you do n't , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go to the President and tell him you 've discovered the bugging . But then you 'd never know for sure who did it , or for what reason . " " That 's of far less importance to me than it seems to be to you . " " Also , the surveillance could be reinstated at any time without your knowing . " " I 'm sure you 'd tell me if it was . " " I might not know the next time . " Then they sat without speaking and stayed that way until the silence had no air left . " All right , " said Brandenburg at last . " Let 's really talk . Let 's put the pistols on the table . I 'll go along with this . I 'll stay quiet as long as you say . But I want two things in return . " " Yes ? " " First , I want to hear the tapes of all my wife 's phone calls . " Zaslow looked at him . " Come on , Professor . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife about the bugging . So let 's play it straight . " " What 's the second thing you want ? " " A complete surveillance on Secretary of State Williams . Where he goes , whom he sees , taps on his home phone . The works . And I want a weekly log . " " I 'm not sure we can manage that . " Brandenburg laughed . " It 's taken me a while to be convinced , but I have a fair idea now of your capabilities . You can manage it fine . " " What are you looking for ? " " That 's my concern . " " It may help us to know . " " I doubt it . And the less you know , the safer we 'll all be . " " There 's nothing safe about what you 're asking , " said Zaslow . " There 's always the risk of discovery in something like this . Especially with a high cabinet official . " 93  | " The risk will be yours , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be no connection with me . Nor will I offer any help . " " You 're asking a lot . " " So are you , " said Brandenburg . " It 's no great pleasure living in a fish bowl . " " That 's as much for your benefit as ours . " " You have my terms . " Zaslow nodded slowly . Brandenburg again took off first , but this time Zaslow did not watch him from a window . Instead , he removed a small microphone and recording device from the electrical fixture in which it had been placed several hours earlier , slipped them into an inside pocket of his jacket , and examined himself in a large wall mirror . Then satisfied that there were no noticable bulges , he left the motel for the airport . Back in New York , Zaslow went over the meeting with Howard Mercker , then ran the tape for him . " What are you going to do ? " the publisher asked . " I 'll give him what he wants . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and Whitfield just yet . " " Do n't you think he already knows ? " " If he does , why would he want the tapes so badly ? " " To throw us off . " Zaslow looked unconvinced . " Then what is he after with Wil-liams ? " " His job ? " " He has practically everything but the title . " " Well , he may want that too . Or else the State Department is starting to give him trouble . The talk has it that Williams is sharpening a few knives of his own . " Washington , thought Zaslow . A nest of hibernating snakes . " All right , " Mercker said . " What do you really think ? " " The same as you . At this point , I do n't believe any part of it . For all we know , everything Brandenburg says and does may be diversions . Do n't ask me from what . If I knew that , the rest would be simple . " 94  | " The man may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with too much . " " No . If we 're making any mistake at all , it 's more likely to be in not crediting him with enough . " It was only as Zaslow was taxiing crosstown to his apartment later that he had time to consider that the man with whom Brandenburg 's wife was apparently having an affair worked under Williams as Secretary for Middle Eastern Affairs . He had no idea whether this fact held any significance . He decided to consider it a coincidence . And this was something he had learned never to accept without question in his type of work . That same evening , he was presented with what appeared to be another coincidence . . . this time by Kate Burrows . They were having dinner at her apartment , one of many such meals Zaslow had been sharing with her lately . Kate enjoyed cooking , was good at it , and claimed she hated preparing for herself alone . So Zaslow accepted her invitations when he could , warning her that creative cooking was wasted on his indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little better about it , a little less like a solitary animal . Over coffee , she said , " I know where you were last night . " He put down his cup . " You were at a motel outside Washington . " Zaslow stared at her . " What motel ? " " The Capitol Motor Inn . " " Was I with a blonde or brunette ? " " Neither . You were alone . " " How sad , " he said and resumed his coffee drinking . " Do n't you even care how I found out ? " " You had me followed by private detectives . " She laughed . " Sometimes I 'd like to . " " Do n't . It 's very expensive and the reports would be very dull . " " Miss Puzero , my assistant at the library , saw you . She came in all excited this morning . You 'll never guess who I saw in Washington , ' she said . Apparently she was down there for a funeral and stayed at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " She saw you when you spoke at Columbia . She was very impressed . " Kate smiled . " Are you aware that you impress women , Dr. Zaslow ? " " Naturally . It 's what I do best . " He finished his coffee and lit a cigarette . " Does your Miss Puzero know you see me ? " " She knows we live in the same building . " " Nothing more ? " The green eyes turned cool . " You need n't worry , Michael . I 'm really quite discreet about such things . " " I 'm sorry . " He leaned across the table and kissed her . " I just thought you 'd be amused by the coincidence , " she said . But such coincidences did not amuse him . Quite the contrary . They only pointed up his vulnerability . In the face of them , care and experience meant nothing . Zaslow rose and helped her clear the dishes , enjoying this small domestic ritual that had become a regular part of their evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasant illusion of normality . After dinner they usually listened to music and talked , with Kate doing most of the talking and Zaslow stretched comfortably on the couch , smoking , his head in her lap . Kate had become like the phantom lover lonely men invented for themselves in the long , unpeopled stretches of the night . Warm , gentle , sympathetic , she made no demands on him , asked few questions and seemed to take pleasure in whatever they did . Sometimes , in good weather , they took walks aiong Riverside Drive , with the Palisades rising tall across the river and the lights of boats below . Other times they went to the movies , which they both enjoyed . And always there , waiting , was the lovemaking , with its dizzying flow of feeling and insane certainty every time that nothing before had ever been as good , or could possibly be again . Even Zaslow 's instinctive caution had faded . Kate was clearly as she appeared to be . Whatever cool shadows and private ghosts she held in reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . The two red-lined areas in her security check had been cleared in the normal course of conversation . She had gotten her apartment  | so quickly because the president of the Riverside Realty Corporation came from her home town and was a close friend and former patient of her father . The unaccounted for period between June of 1962 and May of 1963 simply represented the trying aftermath of her broken marriage , when she withdrew to a small , rented place on Martha 's Vineyard and did absolutely nothing for eleven months . " I felt myself about to fly apart , " she had explained . " I was all loose ends , shaking inside . I was sure I had done something wrong and that it was all my fault . I had to glue myself together and I had to do it alone . It took me almost a year , but when I came out of there I was in one piece again . " Zaslow believed her . Nevertheless , he had both points checked out . Later that evening , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel . " Michael , why did that bother you so much before ? " " Probably my exaggerated sense of privacy . " She looked at him and there were tiny flecks of gold in her eyes . " I know I have no right , but I do wish you shared more with me . I love being with you . We have grand times together and make wonderful love and talk about everything under the sun except the two most important things . What you do and what you believe in . " " You know what I do . I write books , deliver long-winded , esoteric lectures to spellbound audiences , and am pleasantly overpaid by a publishing company . As for what I believe , you 've read pretty much all of that in my books and I see no point in belaboring it . " " That 's what you believe , " she said . " But what do you believe in ? " " You mean things like God and related subjects ? " " Do n't make fun of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just not very big on deep , philosophical discussions . " He was silent for a moment . " I suppose what I believe in mostly is doing what I feel is required of me . " " You frighten me sometimes . " " How ? " " I do n't know exactly . But you give me the feeling there are  | things you do that I know nothing about , things that are secretive and dangerous . " " I 'm an academic type . I work with words . There 's nothing secretive or dangerous about words . " " What worries me most , " she said , " is that you 're so sure , so intense , so damned moral in your convictions . " " Why should that worry you ? " " Because that 's the stuff fanatics are made of . " " You think me capable of wild , fanatical acts ? " " I think you capable of anything . " Her face was solemn . " And I also think I love you more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be very careful , he was thinking . Hearing that does n't disturb me nearly as much as I know it should .  | They were sitting and drinking late one night in Hartewell 's apartment , a cluster of eaved rooms on the top floor of Party Headquarters . The rooms were essentially spartan , but there was a fine stone fireplace in the study and the walls were crowded with paintings . Hartewell himself had painted them , raw , violent primitives that Arend disliked so much he found them disturbing . The first time Hartewell brought him up , he tried to ignore them , but the Party Leader had asked his opinion . " You 're a genuine Grandma Moses , " Arend said and Hartewell had laughed . " I know they 're primitive as hell , but I happen to believe that 's what painting is all about . The unvarnished basics . Your own . Once you cover them with training and sophistication , they show nothing . Only veneer . " Given a choice , Arend would have preferred more veneer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell upon . At best , they made him uncomfortable . At worst , they were frightening . Still , he thought , that 's why I 'm here . Merely being invited upstairs had represented a significant breakthrough , a sign of further trust . And with it , along with Arend 's appointment as First Party Secretary , had come the first of the revelations . " There are certain things you should know , " Hartewell said one day . " We 're growing fast and I ca n't hold all the strings  | myself anymore . I need a dependable back-up , someone to help keep control in emergencies , someone with enough brains to understand our goals and enough presence not to blow under pressure . I 've watched you carefully and I think you have both . " He paused and Arend felt like a deserving pilgrim about to be blessed with his first glimpse of the Holy Grail . " I 'm sure you 've wondered about our source of funds . And you should . Because without real money behind us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were until recently . All I had before that was a raunchy bunch of misfits that I was struggling to keep together and in the public eye . You ca n't imagine what it was like . I had to plead and beg . I had to scrounge hand-outs from every radical-right mailing list I could dig up , lists that included the lowest gutter level bigots in the country . I used to shake nickels and dimes from envelopes for rent money . It was that bad . But I hung in there . Do you know why ? Because I knew that sooner or later , if I could just last long enough , I was going to be picked up by someone who could use me . And some months ago , it finally happened . " Hartewell nodded slowly , half smiling . " A man walked in one day and introduced himself as James Benson , an investment counselor from Chicago . He said he represented a group of extremely wealthy clients who agreed with what the A.R.P . stood for and who were interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain anonymous and that any effort on my part to learn their identities would immediately cut off all support . I was to rest assured , however , that they were all good patriots like myself , who believed the Republic was being sold out from within by a Zionist conspiracy , and that the best counter-measure was to educate the American public to this fact . Following this line , the A.R.P . was to include in its platform the demand that America declare its neutrality in the Middle East and repudiate all commitments , expressed or implied , to send United States troops to participate in any future Middle East conflict . We were also to campaign for the prohibition of arms sales to belligerents , the halting of private loans by American banking interests to warring powers , and the banning of foreign government bond sales in this country . All obviously aimed at hurting Israel . If  | I went along with these conditions , I would be guaranteed enough money to organize and set up Party branches in a dozen more major cities , to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whatever publicity and legal services were needed . The funds would allegedly come from a variety of sources , all clean , all conforming to full disclosure laws , all laundered carefully enough to make them impossible to trace . Benson made it clear that he was to be my sole contact with his clients . I would receive all money and instructions from him , and he would accept and pass on my monthly statements , and answer whatever policy questions might arise . Those were the rules he set down , and those are the rules I 've followed since that day . " " And you still do n't know who 's behind him ? " " I frankly do n't care , Robert . Though I 've a pretty good idea . If you study these things , they 're not that hard to figure . You can forget that pap about good patriots , and fear of a Zionist conspiracy . These people obviously want to build as much grass roots pressure as possible against Jews in general and the State of Israel in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Not that this bothers me . I 'd take a hand-out from the great horned-goat himself if it served my purpose . " The second revelation had come several weeks later . A militant editor of Free Palestine , the leading pro-Fatah newspaper in the United States , was shot dead by an unknown assailant on a New York street . The police treated the murder as a political crime organized by Israeli agents , and there was a great outcry by politicians and the media against such terror tactics on American soil . In his own speeches and press releases , Hartewell banged the same drum , but confided something quite different to Robert Arend as part of his education . " We ordered that killing , " he told him . " A regrettable but necessary part of our overall strategy . If we want the Jews charged with terrorism , this is the only way to insure it . " Arend had felt his skin crawl . He was gradually learning what he had been put there to learn , yet his last frail illusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger in an alien land of money , power , and hidden motives , a member of an  | amorphous underworld , secure nowhere . He could be shot down on any street corner ( like the Arab editor ) and the police would have the blood hosed off the pavement and the traffic flowing before you could say a fast yisgadal . And other than Michael Zaslow , who would there be to know or care ? His parents were gone and he had no family or close friends . And his relationships with women had been too light and brief , too haunted by time and what he did , to mean anything . He hunted mates like some creature of the forest , joined fleetingly with them and parted . Tomorrow was another day and another hunt . He had never known homecomings and kisses at the door and the daily loving cleansing from all the sins of his trade . Nor had he badly . Now he sat before a crackling log fire with John Hartewell , the two of them drinking bourbon from beer mugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of alcohol , success , and late-night gemulichkeit to wax almost lyrical . " . . . Think always in the frame of history , Robert . It makes everything we have to do that much easier . It takes time to build a new national consciousness . Right now we 're starting with a totally revolutionary point of focus . What people do n't realize is that all political invention has to grow out of disunity , violence , even cruelty . Only later can we afford the luxury of general benevolence .... " The voice flowed on , like the voice of a scholar in a library , reading from a favorite book he had memorized . Outside , in the darkness , rain hit the windows in angry spurts , making the fire in the hearth doubly inviting . Staring into the flames , Arend felt warm and pleasantly lulled . " If time and events have proven anything , " Hartewell was saying , " it 's that the ultimate truth always seems to be a lie at first . People are sluggish to change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats and lies . Machiavelli said it all five hundred years ago and nothing important has been added since . In politics , there 's no other rule possible than the old one , that the end justifies the means . Which is why I can watch temples burned , innocent men  | killed , and an entire race falsely defamed without losing a minute 's sleep . " Hartewell looked off somewhere . " Do you know that not a single Christian state has ever really followed a true Christian policy ? In time of conflict , they always seem to have to take cruel and unusual steps to defend themselves . Which , of course , forces them to put off indefinitely all practice of humanism . History has no conscience . To want to conduct history according to Sunday school rules means to leave everything as it is . And this makes it doubly hard for me in what I 'm trying to do . " In the firelight , Hartewell 's face had grown slack , brooding , oddly vulnerable . Gauging the moment and mood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're trying to do ? " The Party Leader turned to look at him . " What do you think I 'm trying to do ? " " It 's hard to tell . One minute you come on as a cynical opportunist , and the next you 've got the zeal of a revolutionary and the dogma to match . You 're building a radical-right political organization , yet you 've never been on an election ballot or backed anyone who has . You 're not training any storm troopers that I know of , yet you started off with all the trappings of a neo-fascist . You do n't mind being subsidized by foreign funds , yet you make all the noises of an America-Firster . " Robert Arend shrugged . " I have n't the faintest idea what it all adds up to . " " Then tell me this , " said Hartewell . " What are you trying to do ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well , let 's face it . You 're hardly typical of the breed I attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nice , sweet middleclass background . In fact you 're so uncharacteristic , I was suspicious at first . I thought you might be a Federal undercover . We 've had a few , you know , but I 've always been able to spot them . Anyway I was cautious enough to have you checked out and kept under surveillance for a few weeks . " Arend just stared at him . " Sorry , " said Hartewell . " I 've got too much on the line to take 103  | chances . Especially when I planned to move you up . " " I 'm glad I was clean . " " So am I. But I 'm still not sure I know what you 're really after . " Arend felt the liquor suddenly burn his stomach . " I 'm not sure I know myself . Except that you did generate an excitement that attracted me . You seemed headed for uncharted waters and it made me want to go along . Your ideology , methods , and people may not have been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose that 's what I invested in . " " Then my ultimate goals actually are n't that important to you . " " They were n't at first . Maybe not even now . Because even without knowing , I 'm obviously going along with you . " Arend grinned . " But I admit I 'm curious as all hell . " Hartewell 's glance was long and considering . " I guess you are . But I 'm afraid that 's not nearly enough reason for me to peel myself down for you . " Then he went on to speak of other things and Robert Arend had the feeling he had made his first tactical blunder . It was a full-dress affair at the American Embassy in London , with soft string music in the background and everyone looking distinguished , rich , or beautiful . Surveying the scene , Judi Haynes had the feeling she had gone through all this before in one of her pictures , that the characters and setting were exactly the same , the costumes very little different . By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your old performances , but always too late to star in them . Philip Terrill stood with a group of uniformed military men , none of whom were below the rank of major-general , and Judi sat off to one side , watching . She did not like the generals ' faces . They seemed totally miscast . They looked more like the faces of small town merchants than those of generals . They should have looked harder , tougher , leaner , more determined , with eyes haunted by visions of pain and death . Instead , they looked as though they might be about to sell you a washing machine or a package of sanitary napkins . She half-smiled and Terrill caught her glance and motioned her over , but she shook her head . She needed a respite . She had been 104  | feeling curiously uncomfortable , almost shy , all evening . When she had passed the age of twenty , she was sure she would never again feel shy for the rest of her life . After that she had been at ease everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain she could get by in any company . Yet tonight she had felt misplaced and inconsequential , as though the years of achievement had never happened , and even if they had , meant little to those present . Everyone had been gracious enough , including the Ambassador and Prime Minister , but this unquestionably had more to do with Philip than with her . Had he brought along one of the hotel chambermaids , she was sure they would have behaved no differently . This was the first time she was seeing him in his own milieu and she was impressed . Even among these giants , he stood tall , remained commanding . Yet at one point , earlier , with the gilt and braid shimmering all around , he had gripped her arm and whispered , " Stay with me . I could n't bear it if you went away . " Judi had looked at him . He was standing close to her , his head cocked to one side , staring down at her very seriously . He means it , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender and cautious at the same time . What did he want ? The question flirted at the edges of her mind . Whatever it is , she thought guardedly , I 've got to make sure I do n't want it also . They had been in London for almost a week . During much of this time he had been busy with meetings and conferences ; a few in their hotel suite , others in various parts of the city . Sometimes he spoke of them to Judi , other times , not . Either way , she was careful never to ask questions . But whatever names and bits of information she picked up , she reported in outside calls to the number Michael Zaslow had given her . There was always the same flat , male voice at the other end of the wire , which said hello , offered the proper code words in answer to her own , then said goodbye when she had completed her message . It was all routine and all accomplished without joy . She believed in what she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were a sensible grown-up human being , you learned not to expect pleasure from such things . What you hoped for mostly was a satisfied sense of justice and did n't always manage to 105  | get that . Chai could sometimes be cold , ruthless , harshly unfair . Often she hated it , thought it insane . Yet she knew it had more reason for being than most functioning systems , that it would care for those under its charge to the best of its abilities , and that it would ultimately produce as much good and as little harm as human intention and skill could arrange . Before , between , and after Terrill 's meetings , they had made love , seen a few plays and once , on a rare day of sunshine , had even managed a long drive out of the city . They had gone as far as Dover , left the car and walked along the famous cliffs . The channel lay beneath them , sparkling in the sun , blue and glittering all the way to France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first time I saw this was exactly twenty-three years ago , in April of 1944 , and I was absolutely certain I 'd be dead within six months . " " You were in the war ? " She was surprised and sounded it . He had laughed . " Yes . " " You must have been at least a general . " " At the time I was here , I was a private first class . " " Why ? " ? " Because I was young and foolish enough to insist on volunteering as a private . That was an important part of it . No commission , no special privileges , no safe , clean branch of service . I had this mystic sense , this insane notion that justice must be done by me and to me . Ever since I began to fall into all that money , I felt that one day I would be asked to pay , to somehow even the score . And each day the war went on , that sense grew stronger . Finally , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and enlisted . In the infantry , no less . " He smiled . " One of Dostoevski 's characters once tried to marry a whore out of his sense of guilt . I became an infantry private in the United States Army . " " Did that even things for you ? " " Not really . Not only was n't I killed , but I could n't even manage to pick up a small scratch . Though the day I stood on these cliffs , I was sure I was going to die very soon . It was a Sunday and I had gotten a twenty-four-hour pass . The Germans were sending a few to6  | shells across the channel that morning , and I remember watching them explode among the roofs of the town , and seeing chimneys and buildings go down , and thinking it all seemed so remote , so childishly spiteful and without plan . To deliberately kill an enemy in anger was bad enough , but to murder strangers at random and without malice seemed the ultimate horror . Yet that 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly accidents . I know that now , but did n't then . When I enlisted , I suppose I still had the mistaken belief that there was some sort of divine plan to the whole thing , as though it were all plotted in advance by a master playright . So many alive , so many maimed , so many dead , and each chosen by a particular and carefully thought out piece of logic . Insane . I was trying to pay my debt in a charnel house . " She considered him there in the English sun , bareheaded and slightly graying , and tried to imagine him as a young soldier . " Have you paid any more since ? " " A little here and there . " He grinned . " Maybe the interest on the debt . Surely not the principal . But I still do n't think I 'm going to get away with it . They 'll collect it all one day and it wo n't be at a time or place of my choosing . " Later they had driven into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brick inn where he had stayed that Sunday during the war . On impulse , he called London , canceling an appointment so they could spend the night . He was curiously apologetic . " Forgive my sentiment . It 's really quite unlike me . " She said nothing . " This is the first time I 've been back here . I used to think if I survived the war I would return one day with my wife and try to explain what a feeling of great luxury it had once been , at the age of twenty-eight , to lock myself in a cold , bare room and get into bed alone , at ease , and without anyone to order me to do anything for at least twelve hours . But I never did . You get involved . Besides , you can never really get back the feeling and something is always lost in the failure . " She had wakened during the night to find him at the window , unmoving , a pale wash of moonlight outlining his body . She got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while he turned and kissed the smooth sheet of skin where her throat joined her shoulder . " I never should have come back , " he said . " It was stupid of me . It 's nothing but masochism . " " You 're allowed your moments . The same as the rest of us . " He held her . " Sometimes , " she told him , " I even look at old photographs of myself taken at the age of twenty . And for a woman , there 's absolutely nothing more masochistic than that . In my line of work it could be fatal . " " You handle it well enough . " " Not always . " It took her a few moments . Then she offered it to him as a gift . " I 've had two near misses , Philip . " Pressed close , she could feel him react . There was an actual physical response , as from a blow . It moved her . " Never ! " He whispered it fiercely in the dark room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It can get bad , but never that bad . " " Do n't worry . I 'm well past it now . I 've made all the required adjustments . " " My God , yes , " he said and took her back to bed . That had been two nights ago . Now , at the Embassy party in London , he broke away from his potpourri of generals and came over to where she sat . " Having a terrible time ? " " I feel like Cinderalla after midnight . " " Then let 's get out of here . " " Is it all right for you to leave ? " " All right ? My dear lady . If anyone dares say anything , I 'll buy England and close it down . " He took her hand and they left . It was a soft , clear night and Terrill dismissed the waiting limousine and they walked down toward St. James Street , with the Palace looming dark and medieval at the far end , and the big clock glistening among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the guards standing in their stiff , pompous , old-fashioned version of  | soldiers , and Terrill said , " One night during the blitz , a thousand pounder hit near here and I saw them die like that , at absolute attention . They were n't even allowed to take cover . Poor wooden soldiers , guarding an empty pile of stones while the world crumbled around them . And in one way or another , they 're still doing it . Idiotic . Only the British , God bless them . " " Do n't you like the British ? " He seemed surprised . " I love them . They 're the silliest , most foolish people on earth , but they sat here alone on their little island , while the French gave up and we were diddling around , and they hung on long enough to save what we now enjoy calling the free world . " With linked arms they walked side by side , shoulders touching . Judi had drunk more than she realized and London , shining under a bright moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been here many times before , but suddenly decided now , for the first time , that she loved the city . She loved the worn pavements and the narrow streets winding off the boulevards like entrances to another century . She loved the toy soldiers in their little wooden boxes , and especially those who had died rather than desert their useless posts . And she loved the hour , this calm , dark , moonlit hour , when she could walk comfortably , arm in arm , with a man of whom she was becoming increasingly fond and feel she was doing a worthwhile job and had not been born merely to fritter away her days on celluloid entertainment . She was of some real use and what more could you ask of your time ? Then she felt Philip Terrill 's arm tighten against hers and saw the black car at the curb and the two men who had gotten out and were coming towards them . They wore shapeless raincoats and had kerchiefs tied across their faces below the eyes . Like bandits , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short men , not much taller than she , and one had a small , snub-nosed revolver pointed in the general direction of Philip Terrill 's stomach . " Will you and the lady get into the car , please , " he said . The voice was soft and polite and carried a slight but indeterminate foreign accent . log  | " If this is a hold-up , " said Terrill , " my wallet is in my inside jacket pocket . " " This is not a hold-up . " The man motioned with his revolver . " In the car , please . " Judi glanced about . Other than for the lights of a distant car , the street was deserted . The palace sentries seemed a thousand miles away . Terrill pressed her arm . " We 'd better do as he says . Do n't be frightened . They wo n't hurt us . They just want money . " A third man was at the wheel of the car . He wore no kerchief , but had a slouch hat pulled low over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judi was unable to see his face . One man got into the rear seat with them . The other , the one with the gun , slid in beside the driver . " We 're going to put blindfolds on you , " he said . " Please do n't try to remove them . If you do , we shall only have to tie your hands . " Then blindfolds in place , they drove off . Terrill held Judi 's hand . " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't worry about me , " she said . " I 'm all right . " But she was not all right . She was so angry and upset she was trembling . Michael should have prepared her . At least that . Unless , of course , it had been a sudden decision . Then , more calmly , she knew better . Under any conditions , they would not have been able to warn her . These things were always handled on a need-to-know basis . And as good an actress as she was , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her performance . Still , she did n't like it . Whatever the reasons for the act , its implications frightened her . And apart from everything else , it somehow felt wrong . Judi had no way of knowing then , but she was mistaken in blaming Chai . In fact it was not until almost twelve hours after the event , that Michael Zaslow received his first hint that something may have happened . It came in a coded message from London which stated that one of Judi 's contact periods had been missed entirely and that a second was long overdue . Two hours later a second message reported that Philip Terrill had failed to show up for a scheduled  | meeting at the main London office of the Manhattan National Bank and apparently no one knew why . There was nothing from any of the wire services , but Zaslow discounted this . Even if something had happened to Terrill , his people would try to keep it quiet for as long as possible . The financial markets were sensitive to shock news of any sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect could be considerable . Zaslow kept in touch with London and waited . His major concern right now was for Judi . Her last communications had begun to show a few threads of possible interest and he hoped she had n't gotten careless . Regardless of experience , that particular danger was always present . Reuters carried something the next day . Not very much . Just that Phillip Terrill had failed to appear for several meetings and could not be reached at his hotel . There was some speculation as to where he might be , but a spokesman for the bank was quoted as saying that Mr. Terrill had simply taken a brief holiday and that there was absolutely no cause for alarm . Six and a half hours after this official reassurance , the editor of the London Times received a hand-printed letter bearing a Paris postmark and reading " We have Mister Philip Terrill and his companion , Miss Judi Haynes , in custody . They are unharmed . To insure their continued safety , this and all further communications are to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow . " It was signed , Palestine Liberation Movement . The tape arrived at the Times office several hours later , and was carried by BBC during the evening 's newscasts . A male voice said , " This is Phillip Terrill speaking . Miss Haynes and I are being held by representitives of the Palestine Liberation Movement . We are comfortable and are being treated well . " That was all . Experts compared the tape with known recordings of Terrill 's voice and confirmed the message as authentically his . In New York , directors of the Manhattan National Bank issued a statement to the effect that the operations of Manhattan 's worldwide network of more than two thousand branches would be un-  | affected by what would , they hoped , prove to be the brief absence of their chairman . They also requested the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend trading in the Bank 's stock until the situation was resolved . In Greenwich , Connecticut , the Terrill estate was closed to visitors and Mrs. Terrill remained unavailable for comment . In Hollywood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judi 's recently completed picture and double its advertising budget .  | George Lewellyn was listening to the first tapes recorded by the voice-activated system he had installed in Pembroke Whitfield 's bedroom . He had researched his subject thoroughly and kept Whitfield 's file open in front of him as he listened . The Assistant Secretary had an easy , rather pleasant voice but did not do very much talking . It was part of his exceptional self-confidence that he did not speak unless he wanted to , that he could accept long silences rather than leap in with casual small-talk , Lewellyn found he differed in this from most diplomats , who usually depended on a steady dialogue as part of their psychological technique . Whitfield apparently worked better with facts and action . That he produced results this way , was attested to by his swift advancement in a Department rarely noted for its swiftness in anything . Of course it also had n't hurt to start out with all the proper credentials . His background file was impressive . So far , his family had produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included three governors , two vice-presidents and assorted jurists , legislators and cabinet officers . Whitfield himself had come to the State Department via Andover and Princeton , been posted for fifteen years in the hottest spots in the Middle East  | ( Damascus , Cairo , Jerusalem , Beirut ) and acquitted himself well enough to be named Assistant Secretary for that area at a time when it was potentially the most volatile in the world . There were F.B.I . memos in his file that indicated he had done work for the Central Intelligence Agency while out of the country , but this was not unusual for foreign service officers at any time and especially not during the past decade . Still , Lewellyn had pushed further into the C.I.A . records to make sure there was not any more recent data around . There were a great many memos , but most of them repetitious , most of them the same things already reported from other sources . The sort of stupid over-organization , thought Lewellyn , that still passed for efficiency with every government agency he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitfield in the file , and they showed an appearance fully consistent with what Lewellyn would have expected . Pure WASP from top to bottom , he looked an athlete ten or fifteen years past his prime . His hair was cut shorter than was currently fashionable , and his face had a hard , clean line that left it barren of humor and imagination . He was tall and thin and there was a coldness about him , an air of quiet self-sufficiency which equipped him well for the business of diplomacy . Taken altogether , he was a man Lewellyn had instantly judged and decided not to like . Unfair . But he was given to such judgments and had to guard against them in his work . Listening , he heard Gertrude Brandenburg 's small cries of love come over the tape . They were becoming familiar to him . He had heard them now from two different sources , in response to two different men and found they remained pretty much the same . One of nature 's better safeguards against extinction . Make all parts interchangeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether this would ultimately be good for the planet or bad , Lewellyn did not know . He was not , after all , a metaphysician . Only a listener . Most of what he heard was gibberish , but it was better than nothing . At least it was company . But this particular listening had been Zaslow 's idea , not his . Lewellyn expected no more than the usual lovers ' chatter , but the  | professor had said he had a feeling about it . For an intellectual , Zaslow could also operate on an oddly mystic level . Still , Lewellyn had found his " feelings " to be right more often than not . It was just that this one had taken a lot of doing , and all on his own time . The Bureau , of course , knew nothing about it . Fortunately , he could manage that much freedom of operation . The sounds of love accelerated and crescendoed , with Whitfield making his own meager contribution at the end . The poor uptight goy , thought Lewellyn , and speeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , at a more leisurely time , he might have listened to out of simple curiosity . " My God ! " said Whitfield . " You 're going to really kill me one day . " I hope not , darling . " " I 'm surprised you have n't finished off Charles yet . " " Do n't , " she said . " I hate talking about him like that . " " It was just a bad joke . " " I know . But it still makes me feel dirty . " " I 'm sorry . " " I guess I just ca n't used to being in two men 's beds . " " I apologize for that too . " " You did n't force me . " " You never should have married Charles in the first place . I still ca n't understand why you did . " " I 'm sure there are those who ca n't understand why he married me . " " That part is pretty obvious . " " Thank you , darling . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles and he could have had his pick . You ca n't ignore who and what this man is . " " Maybe not , but he 's still twice your age . " " That is n't the problem . I 'm the problem . I think he 's just too much for me . Intellectually , anyway . " Whitfield laughed . " Oh , come on . " " Darling , it 's true . Sometimes he can be positively awesome . He does n't just know things . He knows the reasons for them . Do you U5  | have any idea what it 's like to live with someone like that ? " " Fortunately , no . " " Not that he ever deliberately puts me down . It might be simpler if he did . Then I could just tell him to go to hell . As it is , he 's always trying to be kind and positive . He even goes so far as to discuss his work and ask my opinion on things . If it were n't so sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually followed my advice one day , I could cause a national catastrophe . " " Just be careful what you advise about my department . I do n't feel like looking for another job just yet . " " Darling , it 's all planned . I 'm going to have you made Secretary of State . " " You 're a love . But I 'm afraid Charles has his own eye on that particular spot . " " Where on earth did you get that idea ? " " It 's all over the Department . " For the first time , Lewellyn began listening with really intense interest . " Well , it 's not true , " said Gertrude Brandenburg . " Charles has no ambitions whatsoever in that direction . " " How can you be so sure ? " " Because it 's one of the things he would have told me . If anything , he 'd like to get out of government entirely . He thinks it 's a rat 's nest . The only reason he 's in it now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's really hoping for is a Supreme Court appointment . In fact he may even have gotten a commitment on the next opening . So you see , darling , " she said more softly , " I may get to make you Secretary after all . " But the only thing she was going to be making him , for at least a while to come , was sexually satisfied . The politics of bed , thought Lewellyn . Still , if Madame Pompadour could get a Marshal 's baton for her favorite by slipping into the King 's chamber , Gertrude Brandenburg could surely do her own small bit for her fair-haired diplomat . A wry joke , of course . She would do nothing for him . Except , perhaps , get him into more trouble than he had any reason to imagine . Lewellyn had come to know her , this Gertrude Bran-  | denburg , this lovely product of New York 's gilded ghetto , with her fantasies of love and fulfillment . One day an earthquake of her own making would throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An intelligent woman , but love was her nipple and she fought to suckle . In bed , at least , she felt no inadequacy . On later tapes , recorded at other bedroom meetings , they went on talking about Charles Brandenburg . So that it began to seem , to Lewellyn , as though there were three of them together in that invisible bed . Two carnivora feeding upon an apparently willing third . And what a rending of flesh . Even through the tape it drew a mood . Lewellyn recognized it , this immutable need of betrayers to pick at the carcass of the betrayed . Theirs was rarely just lovers ' chatter . More often it became a seminar on the President 's closest advisor , a ramble through his thinking and opinions , a tabulation of those he favored or opposed , a gauging of wind signs , of the direction in which he might be likely to nudge the President on current policy matters . And all licked , nibbled , and chewed until each bone was sucked clean . Maybe the Professor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried in all this . He had no idea what , but knew it would come out in time if it was there . It always did . He felt the satisfaction of good tradecraft , but also felt depressed . An occupational hazard . Negative vision was finally developed . It turned everything backwards . . . love , hope , the verities . When you had done your digging and uncovered only the pure and loyal , you had failed at your job . But , sadly , you did n't fail often . Not often enough , anyway . Listening to the final and most recent tape , Lewellyn heard the sudden , hysterical clanging of a telephone . The receiver was lifted and Pembroke Whitfield said , " Hello . " " Pem , this is Ralph . Have you heard the radio ? " Lewellyn recognized the deep , slightly hesitant voice of the Secretary of State . " No , " said Whitfield . " What is it ? " " Phillip Terrill has been kidnapped in London . It was just reported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitfield responded with silence . n7  | " It has n't been authenticated yet , " said Ralph Williams . " They 're waiting for that now . An American woman with him was evidently taken also . Can you possibly meet me at the office in an hour ? " " I 'll be there , " Witfield said and hung up . Lewellyn checked the date on the tape schedule . This one had been recorded only about thirty-two hours ago . " What is it ? " Gertrude asked . Whitfield told her . " I 've got to get to the office right away . Those terrorists are from my area . " " What do they want ? " " Probably money and attention . With Terrill , they 'll get both . He 's a big one . " They were evidently out of bed and dressing . Lewellyn could hear them moving about . " Who was the woman with him ? " " I do n't know . " Whitfield must have been in the bathroom , because his voice came over faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did Williams tell you her name ? " " No . " " Will you have to go to London ? " " Probably . I 'll be in touch with you . Will you be home tomor-row ? " " Most of the day . " " I 'll try to call you in the afternoon . " The recording ended soon after . Lewellyn started to rewind , then suddenly stopped and ran the last segment over again . He listened carefully . At no point during the telephone call had Ralph Williams said anything at all to indicate that the abducted woman was an actress . It was forty-eight hours since news of the kidnapping had come over the wire services , and Michael Zaslow had spent all but six of them in his office . He had gone to his apartment once to nap , shower , and change his clothes , and had met briefly with George Lewellyn n8  | in a car . Otherwise , he had not left his desk . Howard Mercker had been with him during much of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone now . The office and its phones were quiet , and no sound , not even a siren , could rise far enough above the nighttime city to breach his tower . Stiff , aching in his bad arm , he stretched and walked to a window . Far below , the East River slid past , looking black and dangerous . Down river , on the Queens side , an enormous sign wrote its message in electric letters of red . PEPSI-COLA . Look across the greatest city in the whole damn world , he thought , look for answers and see the mystic words of the oracle shining out of the darkness , saying PEPSI-COLA . The past two days had been crowded , confusing , and frenetic . Twenty-four hours after the initial announcement of the kidnapping , the London Times had received a second tape . Accompanying instructions asked that the contents of the tape be printed in the next editions of the paper , and that the tape itself be aired by BBC in its morning and evening newscasts . The instructions were carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " This is the voice of the Palestine Liberation Movement , speaking for the three million voiceless Palestinians driven into exile by Israeli aggression . We are taking these extreme measures to call attention to our plight and enlist the support of fair-minded peoples everywhere . We are desperate . We have nothing to lose but our lives , and as we are living today they are worth nothing . Since we are victims of a world in which money is power and power is right , we have chosen a leading symbol of that power as our hostage . Philip Terrill is Chief Executive Officer of an American bank with assets of forty billion dollars and branches in seventy-four countries . His influence can not be measured . While he is in our hands some of that influence will pass to us . We will be listened to . Our voiceless three million will have a voice . Additional tapes and further instructions will follow this . If our demands are met , Philip Terrill will be released unharmed . Otherwise , he will be executed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major American networks and ny  | carried , in local translations , throughout most of the world . There was no mention of Judi Haynes . She had apparently been picked up only because she happened to be with Terrill at the time . She was not considered of any particular value in her own right . The abduction was strongly condemned as an act of barbarism by the Western press , labeled the inevitable result of capitalist aggression by the Communist bloc , and generally rejoiced in but disavowed by the Arabs . In Lebanon , leaders of the PLM denied all responsibility and claimed that no known members of their organization were involved . The more moderate Al Fatah regretted the need for such tactics , but said all blame must be placed where it rightfully belonged . . . with the Israelis . Only when the plight of the Palestinian refugees was resolved , they declared , would the threat of even worse calamities be erased . Zaslow paid little attention to the official pronouncements . He had his own sources of information from which a steady stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , they had not produced very much . His people in Israeli Intelligence could usually come up with fast , accurate leads on Arab action anywhere , but this time they had been able to offer little . It was odd . With agents operating in every major city and guerrilla camp in Jordan and Lebanon , something should have been heard . As it was , Dov Shimkoff in Jerusalem and Shimon Gurion in Amman had both reported the same lack of results from their respective networks . Shimkoff actually had a man in PLM command circles , but few hard facts came even from this source . There were the usual interfactional jealousies and rancor , with all groups hinting at more than they obviously knew . One claimed credit , another accused , a third whispered knowingly of secret plans . Which meant they were Arabs and were simply acting as such . Shimkoff had once tried to explain them to Zaslow . " Four Arabs mean an absolute minimum of four opinions . That 's how they invented the camel . A bunch of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shimkoff had grown up with and lived among Arabs all his life . He understood the Arab mentality , their convoluted way of thinking .  | It was to him that Zaslow went about all problems in that area . Shimkoff not only ran the most productive string of agents in Israeli Intelligence , but had connections in every embassy and consulate in the Middle East . He spoke half a dozen languages with fluent ease and was cosmopolitan and charming . He was unorthodox in his style and behavior , and probably even heroic . Zaslow called him their Jewish Lawrence of Arabia . When he had spoken to him on the phone a short while before , for the second time in the past twenty hours , their brief conversation would have made little sense to anyone listening . " This is Moshe on Calvary , " said Shimkoff when Zaslow had answered the phone and identified himself . Zaslow heard the high , confident swirl of a violin somewhere in the background , six thousand miles away . The furiously cultured Jews of the world , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week they 'd have a music and arts foundation going and be out selling tickets . " Hello , Moshe , " he said . " What 's happening on the Hill ? " " About as before . A lot of joy among the heathens . They consider it a glorious act . Not publicly , of course . Out loud there 's clucking , disavowing , and beating of breasts . It makes them appear uncivilized , they say . Which they are . They 're still sleeping with the goats . " There was a pause and the violin rushed to fill it . " A few things , though , " Shimkoff said . " It 's hard to tell whether they mean much , but for one thing , there does seem to be rather an odd note to the songs being sung behind all the palace walls . " " What 's that ? " " The tunes are too much the same . They almost seem to have been orchestrated . Another thing . Three of my brothers are lost . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them very much . " " When ? " " Just before the Crucifixion . " " Where were they lost from ? " " The first two Stations of the Cross . " 121  | " Do you make any connection ? " said Zaslow . " Like yourself , I worry about coincidence . Anyway , we 're still checking the mail . Why all the interest ? " " Apart from the obvious , Mary is our sister and naturally very dear to us . " " Well , Jesus save me , " said Shimkoff in the first show of surprise Zaslow had heard from him in years . " Bless you , Father . We 'll do what we can . " All of which meant that the more moderate Arab leadership was reacting with curiously atypical unanimity to the abduction , and that three of Shimkoff 's best agents had evidently disappeared just before it took place . Which may or may not have had anything to do with it , but intelligence to Shimkoff was an infinite capacity for suspicion , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything left behind . The surprise to him , was Judi being one of their own . The revelation broke normal policy , but Zaslow felt the circumstances warranted Shimkoff knowing . A little extra incentive never hurt . Zaslow 's meeting with George Lewellyn had come later that same night . He had taken a cab to the East Sixty-Sixth Street entrance to Central Park , and the FBI agent picked him up there in a rented car . They drove crosstown through the Park , then north on the West Side Highway . Strands of mist hung low over the river and Zaslow saw the building where he lived rising darkly off to the right . He counted twelve floors up and found a light in Kate 's bedroom . She must be reading , he thought , and suddenly wished himself beside her . He turned away and looked at Lewellyn instead , at the closecropped hair and still boyish features that seemed to age hardly at all . It was almost twenty years since he had walked in with his father on that sunny spring day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many regrets he 'd had over the years , how often he had wished he 'd never met him . Undoubtedly , often enough . Although Lewellyn was well disciplined and intensely dedicated and rarely let such things hang out . It was Lewellyn who had requested the meeting , but it was not until they were passing under the George Washington Bridge that  | he finally got to it . " I may have come up with something on the Whitfield tapes , " he said , and told Zaslow about the details of the last recording . " Are you sure Whitfield could n't have heard something on the radio or TV ? " Zaslow asked . " They were in the bedroom . There was no radio or TV going . Not even for a minute . " " What about phone calls ? " " I checked . From the time news of the abduction first broke , there were only two other calls . One was from Whitfield 's sister , and the other from a friend . Neither call mentioned anything about the kidnapping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman with Terrill was an actress ? " " I ca n't explain it . Unless he has a better source of intelligence than anyone around , or else a direct line to the PLM . " Lewellyn drove in silence for a moment . " Come to think of it , he 's spent fifteen years among those Arabs . They 're old friends of his . And according to his files , he 's done almost as much work for the CIA in that area as he has for the State Department . " " Which means what ? " Lewellyn frowned through the windshield , a lean , tough-faced closet Jew with a botched nose job that gave him the look of an Irish middleweight . " Which means your feeling was probably right . There 's more there than just sex . At least as far as Whitfield is concerned . But what I ca n't figure out is Brandenburg 's role in all this . By not telling his wife about the bugging , he seems to have deliberately set her up to lead us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on ? " " I think he knows a lot more than we have any idea of . I 've always thought that . " They were together only about an hour . Then Lewellyn had dropped Zaslow off a few blocks from Galatea Press and gone back to Washington . Alone in his office now , Zaslow stared off tiredly at the PEPSICOLA sign and felt his mind slip in and out of gear like a rundown I23  | engine . He thought wistfully of the light in that twelfth floor window over the river , and again wished himself up there with Kate . Go on , he told himself . Enough is enough . Leave this place . Are you trying to balance the whole bloody world on your head ? Go to Kate . She 'll give you food and drink , take off your shoes , smooth the furrows from your brow , tell you how wonderful you are , kiss you , take you to bed , love you , and finally let you sleep . Good Kate . But he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave his office phone . Shimkoff had his home number , but there were others he hoped to hear from who did not . He was more concerned about Judi than he was willing to admit . For a while , at least , she was sure to consider the whole thing a Chai operation and be happily cursing him and the entire organization . That part was all right . She would play her role properly , without mistakes . The real trouble would come if and when they started pressing her . Everyone finally broke at a particular level of pain , but if Judi believed herself to be in Chaff 's hands , and they began to make things even slightly unpleasant , she might very well try to identify herself and reveal more than was necessary or even expected . Not that she knew very much . They had always operated on a need-to-know basis and any accusation , without proof , could be easily denied . But in the current world climate it could still make things sticky enough to bring added pressure everywhere . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real reason for them to hurt or even threaten her . If they had simply scooped her up with Terrill by accident , and were just after a bit of cash and propaganda , then he was worrying for nothing . She and Terrill would be treated decently and released as soon as the kidnappers ' terms were met . Except , he thought cheerlessly , that he had been conditioned too long and too well by what he did , to believe that anything was ever entirely as it seemed . In this , you simply did not survive if you believed otherwise . The American Renaissance Party 's official response to the abduction came as spontaneously as a knee-jerk reflex . " Clearly , " it declared in press releases and interviews , " the patience of the longsuffering Palestinians was at last wearing thin . The continuing  | criminal arrogance of Israel had finally proven too much even for them . Frustration was a poisonous diet and they had been living on little else for almost two decades . Small wonder they were being driven to desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was just a symptom of the disease , not the disease itself . It was World Zionism that had to be considered the true infestation . And only when this malignancy was treated and cured , would the world be spared the pain of its eruptions . " But John Hartewell 's private response was very different . " Those idiots , those flea-bitten fools ! " he raged . " They should n't be allowed to run loose . They should be locked in cages . All they do is damage to themselves and everyone involved . You work your ass off to build empathy , to create some sort of reasonable image for them , and in one crazy act they wash out everything . And worst of all , they had to pick on a pair of Americans . Jesus , do n't they know we 've practically a national psychosis when it comes to kidnapping ? Do anything else . . . rape , murder , arson , and we 'll somehow shrug it off , even forgive it . But kidnapping ? My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert Arend listened and said nothing . A fierce , green milky cloud darkened Hartewell 's eyes . " And do you realize who these two people are ? " he shouted at Arend and the silent , unoffending walls of Party Headquarters . " Philip Terrill is probably one of the five most influential men in this country . He 's a mover and shaker , an opinion maker . His people control radio and TV networks , newspaper chains , national magazines . They 'll crucify those Arabs , make the whole pack of them look like mad dogs . And Judi Haynes do n't help us one bit either . If I know Hollywood , they 'll dig out all her old movies , send out a barrage of press releases , create an instant Haynes mystique , and turn her into our latest cultural treasure . Watch . Before they 're through , our whole national honor will be threatened . If those Arabs damage so much as a false eyelash , half of our entire infantile sentimental country will be screaming for the marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anger , violent as it seemed , was merely an indulgence . It was mostly for Robert Arend 's 125  | benefit . Alone , he would have shown nothing . Robert Arend sometimes had the feeling that Hartewell existed only in a mirror image , that if at least one other person was not always present to reflect him , his vital signs would dry up and he would disappear . And who would miss him ? Then the visual part of the rage was finished and Arend felt the circuit of shared confidences enclosing them again . Hartewell 's face , with its lean , ascetic grooves , had turned thoughtful . " Of course there could also be some personal advantage for us in all this . If the Arab image does suffer , the need for our work will actually be that much greater . It could even result in faster funding and growth . At least that 's the approach I expect to be taking when I next see Benson . " " When will that be ? " said Arend . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a good , maybe even an outstanding idea if you came along . I want him to meet you . It 's time you got involved at higher levels . How does that sound , Robert ? " " Great . " It sounded even better than that . It was exactly what Arend had been hoping to hear , had in fact been working towards for some time . James Benson still held the only known key to A.R.P funding , and had so far kept it well out of sight . Zaslow had run the usual Code One check and surveillance on him , but had turned up no surprises . He was pretty much what he seemed . . . a Chicago investment manager with a legitimate list of clients , membership in several conservative clubs , a house , a wife and two teen-aged children in Forest Park , and a mistress he saw with fair regularity on Monday evenings and Thursday afternoons . Apparently his instructions for the financing of A.R.P . operations were very long range , because there had so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arend had no idea what good it would do him to meet the man personally , but at least it would bring him that much closer to things . Hartewell was smiling benignly at him . " I have high hopes for you , Robert . You have a lot to learn , but you 're learning fast . Your  | major problem has been that you 've drifted too long without purpose . And you also tend to sentimentalize . I 'm not too much older than you , but in many ways I feel old enough to be your father . Do you know why ? Because I have n't done a thing since I was sixteen without relating it to my purpose , while you'ved drifted and sentimentalized like a Victorian poet . The true modern man is the man who has learned to instantly reason things to their logical conclusions . I have done that . Which is why I 'm sitting here in this headquarters today . And it 's also why I may yet be able to turn this stupid kidnapping to some useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How proud of himself he is , how sure that what he 's doing is the absolutely correct thing to do . Still , there was no denying he had a talent . He had , after all , taken an exceptional intelligence , mixed it with a sharp greed for power , stirred them into a nice , yeasty lump of logical conclusions , then had the patience to wait for the dough to rise . In business that would probably have been called vision , in military operations , good generalship , and in that special branch of opiate dealing , religion , it might even have been accepted under the noble heading of holiness . Frank Chiero , the White House Press Secretary , was in Charles Brandenburg 's office to complain that he was being swamped by calls from the media about the kidnapping . Everyone wanted to know what the President was doing about it . Brandenburg said , " Just tell them he 's keeping in touch with the British authorities and is abreast of the situation . " " I 've been saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on repeating it ? " " As long as you have to . " " I wish I had a more convincing and tranquilizing statement to give them . " " All right . Then say the security of the United States remains essentially unthreatened , and we are not yet considering full mobilization . " Chiero left , his smooth young face looking hurt . But Brandenburg was unmoved . He had just about run out of patience . The  | subject of the kidnapping had kept cropping up all day with whomever he spoke . Officials at all levels and from all branches of government seemed to have a particular stake in the swift , safe return of Philip Terrill . A clear sign of the times , thought the presidential advisor . Snatch away the nation 's poets , clerics , or philosophers , together with their libraries of universal truths , and there would be nary a ripple on the Hill . But pluck a single money-changer from the temple , hide him away for thirty-six hours , and the earth shook .  | Judi opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep beside her . He sleeps , she thought , as though he were keeping a host of secrets . Philip , Philip ... What a solemn little boy he must have been , hurrying through his poor Pennsylvania town , always looking as though he were in the midst of something private and important . He probably had small treasure troves of things hidden in different places . . . trading cards and fish hooks and marbles and sling shots and pictures torn from magazines . That kind of thing . She did n't know much about little boys . She had no brothers or sons . He may as well have come to her from somewhere behind the Ural Mountains . He stirred and sighed heavily , but did n't waken . The windows were boarded and shuttered from the outside and only a trickle of early sun seeped through the cracks . Except for this and a sliver of yellow light that showed under the door , the room was dark . It was also quiet . Although Judi could hear birds and , faintly , cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the house blindfolded , up three flights of stairs and along a short corridor to their room . Before that , they had been driven for what seemed like several hours from where they were picked up in London . They were being held in a large , high-ceilinged room that had a connecting bath , 129  | were fed reasonably edible meals three times a day , had not been mistreated in any manner , and for most of the time were left pretty much to themselves . As for Judi 's concern about the kidnapping being some sort of misguided Chai operation , that had disappeared with the recording of the first tape . In fact once she found Chai and herself free of responsibility , she was able to feel relaxed about the whole thing . Her confidence in Philip Terrill , in his position and influence was such , that she never had the slightest doubt that whatever would be required to affect their safe release would be done . Also , their captors themselves were reassuring . Calm , polite , always in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judi would have associated with Arab terrorists . So far as she could tell , only the three who had picked them up were involved . She had never seen their faces . They always wore masks when they came into the room . But their voices , manner , and movements were young , their English grammatically correct , and Judi had the feeling they might have been college students . The one who seemed to be the leader actually spoke with a slight Oxonian accent . " Well , at least it 's a classy operation , " she had said to Philip . " Is n't it nice to know we 're not involved with just a bunch of ordinary hoods . " Terrill had looked at her curiously . " You 're an extraordinary woman . You 're not the least bit thrown by this , are you ? " " Well , I must confess I would like a change of clothes . " " I think that if I had n't loved you before , I would surely love you now . Any other woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit me with too much , darling . If you were n't with me , I 'm sure I 'd be slightly hysterical myself . How long do you think we 'll be here ? " " It depends upon what they 're asking . If it is n't too unreasonable , maybe not very long . " But the Arabs were apparently in no hurry to be rid of them . They seemed more interested in propagandizing their cause than in negotiating . They had provided a radio , so Judi and Terrill were able to keep up with what was happening . A new tape was arriving at the London Times each morning with the instructions that it be aired by the British Broadcasting Company networks that same day . Each 130  | tape was a repetition of the theme that the world was not getting the true story of the Arab cause , that Zionist influence clouded the issues , and that the true facts had to be told in this way because the Jews controlled most of the news media . It was felt , declared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was understood , the Western world 's sense of fair play would end its misguided support of Israel and return the Palestinians to their own land . The radio reported that each tape arrived at the Times by mail posted from a different city , but that the police believed the hostages were being held somewhere in the general vicinity of London . Terrill stirred once more in the big brass bed . He came slowly out of sleep and ran a hand lightly , in half slumbering possession , over Judi 's body . " Aah , " he murmured , still in the grip of his last dream , and Judi smiled at him . " Is it morning yet ? " he whispered . " Yes , " she said . " But I do n't think you have any early appointments . " " What about you ? Anything important scheduled ? " " Not a thing . " " Is n't that marvelous , " he said and pulled her close . " I guess as kidnappings go , this is n't really such a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in by Issa , the Arab leader . At least Issa was the name he had told them to use in addressing him . He called his two companions Fawzi and Abu . " Since we shall all be together for awhile , " he had said , " it may be easier if we have names . " But inasmuch as all three Arabs were approximately the same height and build , and wore identical masks , Judi found their names of little use in telling them apart . She did learn to recognize their voices , however , and certainly Issa 's crisp , Oxonian English was unmistakably his . On the second day , she had noticed an additional identification , a small scar on the back of his right hand , and stored it away for possible future use . She also made a point of speaking with him as often as she could . She felt her life might depend on this man , and it was vitally important to know as much as possible about him . There might be some chord of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | This morning Issa remained in the room while they ate . He sat in a far corner , smoking an English cigarette through the mouth opening in his mask . A pistol was stuck in his trouser belt , but he appeared relaxed and the small handgun did not seem especially threatening to Judi . " What are you , Issa ? " she asked . " What do you mean , what am I ? " " Are you a student ? A worker ? A farmer ? A professional ? " " I am an Arab , Miss Haynes . " He always treated her with great , almost exaggerated courtesy , Judi noticed , as though he were trying to reassure her in this way , convince her she was not really in any danger . " That 's your nationality , not your occupation . " " Right now , it is also my occupation . There is nothing else in the world that interests me . " " Do you have any family ? " " Yes . " " Do they feel the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not all are able to do something about it . " Issa laughed softly behind his mask . " I suppose you might say that I am one of the lucky ones . " " You consider yourself lucky to kidnap and perhaps shoot two people who have never hurt you ? " " You are not going to be shot , Miss Haynes . As soon as our terms are met , you and Mr. Terrill will be released unharmed . " Terrill said , " And if your terms are not met ? " " They will be met . There is no question of that . They are not at all unreasonable . " " We have n't heard them yet , " said Judi . " If you will listen to your radio at two o'clock this afternoon , you will hear them . " Terrill was drinking his coffee , but put down his cup now . " How about a preview ? " he asked . Issa 's eyes stared darkly at him through the slits in his mask . Then he shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be paid within ten days . " Terrill said nothing . Judi laughed . 132  | Issa asked , " Do you consider fifty million dollars funny , Miss Haynes ? " " No . That 's just a nervous laugh . My God , do you people really think we 're worth that kind of money to anyone ? " " We believe that Mr. Terrill is . " Issa tilted his chair back against the wall . " Are n't you , Mr. Terrill ? " " I do n't know . I 've never been in the position of having to find out before . " Judi said , " If he 's not worth it , what happens to us at the end of the ten days ? " " The broadcast will state that you both will be shot . But as I said before , I am certain it will not come to that . " " That 's very comforting , " said Terrill . " Considering that your companies have taken billions from us , I do n't believe we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to do with so much money ? " " If you visited our refugee camps , if you saw the conditions under which more than a million of our people are being forced to live , you would not have to ask such a question . " " That 's not my fault , Issa . " " No one said it was , Miss Haynes . We did n't really choose you as a hostage . You are here only through chance . " There was movement behind the mask that was probably caused by a smile . " But if you consider how much more pleasant your being here is making it for Mr. Terrill , perhaps you will not feel too badly . " They finished their breakfast and Issa left . Judi looked at Terrill across the small table at which they were sitting . Her head felt clear , too clear , because she suddenly had a deep headache back of her eyes . " I think I 've just gotten a little bit scared , darling . " " You need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fingers had begun a soft tattoo on the table edge . " The money will be paid . " " Just like that ? " " No . Not just like that . Fifty million is a lot of cash at any level . But I have no doubt that it can and will be managed . " How confident he is , she thought . How nice to feel that everything could always , somehow , be managed . Yet she was not wholly 133  | reassured . And watching Philip 's fingers absently working the table , she had the feeling that perhaps neither was he . It was Howard Mercker who brought the first report of the ransom demand into Zaslow 's office . He had heard it on the car radio while driving in from Long Island . One of the dubious advantages of commuting to work , thought Zaslow . You could arrive at the office weighted with the morning 's latest list of disasters . By 9 A.M. your newspaper no longer carried news , only history . " Fifty million ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think it 's enough ? " " No . It 's only money . Since when has the PLM become a fund raising organization ? " " It does seem a little apolitical for them , " Mercker admitted . " Exactly . Why not other concessions ? Why not some of their captured terrorists in exchange ? Why not recognition of their bargaining rights ? Why just money ? " The question bothered Zaslow and stayed with him . In fact he found the entire operation puzzling . Why were there no private negotiations ? The whole thing was beginning to seem like an exercise in public relations . Even the ransom amount had been announced through the media . Later , when he called and spoke with Dov Shimkoff in Jerusalem , the Israeli Intelligence officer reacted pretty much the same way . He was also certain , now , that his three missing agents were either dead or being held by the Arabs , and that their disappearance was somehow connected with the kidnapping . Their emergency letter drops had evidently turned up coded messages that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what appeared to be the early stages of an operation that had something to do with Americans . The third message actually mentioned the possibility of having to go to London . Shimkoff told Zaslow that all three agents seemed to have felt themselves close to something unusual , and all three had lost contact with the network . According to the Israeli Intelligence officer , there had to be some connection . For the time being , Zaslow was willing to go along with Shimkoff 's premise . Stripped down , this meant that the kidnapping was  | not to be regarded as just another extremist Arab performance with limited objectives , but as a carefully planned , high-level operation whose goals were certain to be a lot broader than just picking up some cash and publicity . It also meant a greater involvement for Chai than merely a threat to one of its people . Yet how far , Zaslow wondered , could the P.L.M. hope to go with a kidnapping ? At best , the possibilities were limited . The daily propaganda broadcasts were admittedly reaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of arms , but neither of these achievements qualified as the sort of broad goal that would justify the risks involved . Then there was also the Arabs ' choice of hostages . Why Philip Terrill ? Zaslow rejected out of hand the kidnappers ' publicly stated reasons . Terrill was no enemy of the Arab cause . Quite the opposite . Zaslow had long had him up near the head of his Friends-of-theArabs list . It was why he had put Judi on him in the first place . In fact , of all the American enterprises operating in the Middle East , the Manhattan National Bank and its vast oil interests probably enjoyed the most favored status . The whole thing made no sense . At least not on the face of it . So Zaslow began digging . He already had a substantial file on Terrill , but requested additional material from two of his people . . . one , a systems vicepresident with Manhattan National , the other , an accountant in the comptroller 's office of the Rochemont Foundation . Within twelve hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project sponsored by the Foundation during the past five years , and every Mideast transaction in which the Manhattan National Bank was involved during the same period . He had the film developed and blown up to full-plate size , then carried it all home with him that evening in a large suitcase . He showered , ate a cold meat sandwich for his dinner , and went to work . The doorbell rang at about nine and he knew it was Kate , but he did not answer . There was only the one ring . Later , he felt guilty and was annoyed with himself for the feeling . Easy , he thought , and went back to his piles of records , not knowing what he was looking for , but just seeking something that might strike a responsive chord , make a connection , shed some light . He had found  | life to be reasonless and full of accidents , yet he remained , above all , a devout believer in logic . At times he wondered whether he did n't belong to a class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In return for their unswerving belief in the relevance of actions and events , they were to be shielded from life 's more casual insanities . A metaphysical deal . Such a bargain was childlike , but did n't bother him . No point now in arguing with what he was . All right . Then why Philip Terrill ? By 4 A.M. his eyes would no longer focus , so he walked down two flights of stairs and rang Kate 's bell . He waited several moments , then the door was opened without any questions . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I was in the middle of something and could n't stop . " Her face flushed with sleep , Kate looked at him . " You did n't have to explain . " " I know . But I wanted to . " " My God , you look exhausted , " she said . " Come to bed . " She was gone when the sun woke him at eight-thirty , but the phone rang minutes later . " There 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire . " I thought you might like to know . " Zaslow sighed , delighted with her voice , familiar and warm from across the city . " You 're a very nice girl and very good to me . But you should n't have left me like that . " " Very nice girls still have to work for a living . " " Why did n't you wake me ? " " You looked so tired I did n't have the heart . But I kissed you goodbye . " " Did I say anything ? " " Not then . But before that you cried out in your sleep . " " What kind of cry ? " She took a moment . " You sounded frightened . It upset me a little . " " Do n't be upset . I 'm actually quite fearless . " " The sleeping heart , " she recited softly , " betrays us unashamed in the dark places of our secret dreams . " " Very poetic . I suppose that 's my rewa.rd for getting involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? " " It does appear so . " " You 've just made my morning . Now drink your orange juice , " she ordered and hung up . Zaslow put the receiver down slowly , smiling , and sat for a moment in Kate 's bed , thinking of Kate . Then he got up , dressed , drank the orange juice , and returned to his apartment . The piles of papers were spread across two tables , waiting . He called Howard Mercker at the office to let him know he would not be in , then , with a grunt of distaste , went at the records once more . He disliked the tedium of the work , but without knowing specifically what he was after , there was no way to assign it to anyone else . He pushed through names , dates , figures . The Rochemont Foundation was second only to the Rockefeller in size and activity , and its accounts were awesome . It allocated as much in grants each year as the annual budget of a small nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its own power structure functioning under the aura of philanthropy and general beneficience . Perhaps the judgment was a little unfair , since much good was achieved . Still , all choices did remain in their hands and it was always hard to play God abstractly . Suddenly , Zaslow sat straighter in his chair . He read the few lines a second time , then again , more slowly . It was nothing startling . Just the verification of a half million grant to a San Francisco television station . It was dated about two years ago and was for some experimental programming of children 's shows . There were no further specifics . The only thing that made it noteworthy was that Zaslow happened to recall that the station was owned by the President 's wife . He pressed on chronologically . Six months later , there was a listing for a second half million grant , and a year after that , a third . Zaslow was no longer bored . The records had suddenly developed a personality . Till now they had been the anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cryptic in meaning , free of opinion or judgment . But all at once they had become as insinuating and interesting as a suspense novel . Zaslow telephoned Mercker and asked him to get the financial and programming reports on Station  | KDHA , San Francisco , for the past two years . Then he went back to his reading . Over the next few hours he came up with several more items of possible interest . For one thing , Ralph Williams had evidently been a senior trustee of the Rochemont Foundation for six years before becoming Secretary of State . Also , Global Petroleum Limited , one of the two consotoriums in which the Manhattan National Bank owned controlling interest , had recently been awarded exploration and development contracts for three of the potentially richest oil fields in Libya . There was nothing in any way wrong , secretive , or revealing about either fact . They were both public knowledge . It was just that Zaslow had never been aware of them before . And even as a devout believer in logic , he was not above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands were made public , a spokesman for the Manhattan National Bank announced through the London Times that the ransom would be paid . " Our only concern , " read the bank 's statement , " is for the safety of Miss Haynes and Mr. Terrill . We therefore agree to the stated terms and await further instructions for effecting their release . " Then , for thirty-six hours , there was no further word from the kidnappers . It was during this period that Zaslow had his third meeting with Charles Brandenburg . The presidential advisor was in New York for a United Nations dinner , and they met later that night in the comfortable disorder of Zaslow 's apartment . Still in his dinner clothes , Brandenburg looked distinguished and relaxed as he settled into a deep chair . " Well , I must say I prefer this to our usual motel room . You live here alone ? " " Since my wife died . " " You 're not lonely ? " " I am . Very often . " Brandenburg reared back his head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a curse . I 'm afraid of it . I suppose that 's why I remarried so quickly after I lost my wife . "  | As if to keep some thread of continuity going , Zaslow poured two brandies and handed one to his guest . " It was a mistake , of course , " Brandenburg said . " You can be infinitely more lonely with the wrong woman than alone . For an allegedly intelligent man , I can behave rather stupidly in that area . As I 'm sure you know by now . " He looked at Zaslow for a moment . " But I appreciate your kindness in not telling me . " " Not telling you what ? " " Of my wife 's infidelity . " " If you already knew about your wife , why did you put us on her ? " " Because I wanted her to lead you to Whitfield . I felt if you had both of them under surveillance , you might just possibly learn some things that could serve our mutual needs . " Brandenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his one night of the year to be wholly honest and he intended to go all the way . Still , he could not help smiling , as though with it all , he was amused by any such idea . " I thought , why not make the best of a bad situation ? Since Gertrude 's fidelity was already gone , why not at least try to achieve some benefit from the loss ? So I turned my errant wife into an unwitting double agent . Knowing Whitfield would try to get as much information about me out of her as he could , I fed her only what I wanted him and Williams to hear . " " What have you against Williams ? " " Nothing personal . Only his utter ineffectuality as Secretary of State . At this moment in time , that position is almost as important as the Presidency , and it 's in the hands of a fool . " " Then you want him out of there ? " " I do . " " And yourself in his place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " Only suspicions , " said Zaslow . " Why are you confirming them now ? " " Because I believe it 's time . Because your reports on Williams have been valuable to me and I appreciate the risk and effort that went into getting them . Also , because I 've never talked about these  | things with anyone , and I have wanted to talk with you . I think everyone must finally pick out somebody to confide in or they end up paying forty-five dollars an hour for the privilege . You see , Professor , I was impressed with you long before we met , long before I had any idea of your involvement in these other matters . And since our first meeting , you 've impressed me even more . Despite my reservations about what you 're doing and the way you 're doing it , and despite your making me uncomfortably conscious of being a Jew . I 've never enjoyed having to accept limitations of any sort , and in a very practical sense the mere fact of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean it wo n't let you become President ? " Once more , Brandenburg seemed to smile at himself . " Well , " said Zaslow , " you 're a lot closer to it right now than any of us have ever been before . There should be some satisfaction in that . " " There was . Until you suddenly appeared and switched on a few lights . Now all I seem to see are taps on phones and tailing cars in rear-view mirrors . " Brandenburg rose , went to the window and stared down at the street ten floors below . " It 's a bit hard for them , following me in New York . The poor bastards have to double-park wherever I go . " " You 're accepting it better than you did . " " You can get used to anything . Even that . " " How is the President taking the kidnapping ? " Zaslow said . Brandenburg returned to his chair . " Rather casually . " " Would you call that unusual ? " " Hardly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things are happening that affect the national interest far more than a threat to two people . The President has always tended to be a bit abstracted when he 's taken away from what he regards as the major issues . " Brandenburg finished his drink and poured himself another . " Why so interested in the kidnapping ? Who 's Jewish ? Terrill or the girl ? " Zaslow laughed . " Neither . But where Arabs are involved , so are Jews . Incidentally , did you know your friend Williams was a long- time trustee of the Rochemont Foundation before he became a Cabinet member ? " " No , I did n't . Is that supposed to mean something ? " " Only that he obviously has more than a nodding acquaintance with Terrill . In fact his old law firm is still legal counsel for the Foundation . " " I had no idea he even knew Terrill personally . " " Have you been with him when the kidnapping was discussed ? " " Of course . We 've been together at several White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitfield to London to supervise the ransom negotiations . " " And he mentioned nothing about knowing Terrill , about possible concern for his safety ? Nothing like that ? " Brandenburg shook his head , " I 'm afraid I do n't quite know what you 're getting at . What 's bothering you ? " Zaslow hesitated . " My God , do n't you think you can trust me by now ? " It took some effort , but Zaslow managed not to smile . Nevertheless he told him , starting with Whitfield 's knowledge of a fact he had no logical reason to know , and concluding with his own study of the Foundation and Bank records . Brandenburg listened without interruption . When Zaslow had finished , he nodded slowly . " All right . Then what you 're saying is that you feel there may possibly be a connection between Terrill , the kidnapping , and the State Depart-ment ? " " Does that sound totally insane ? " " Before I met you , I would have very quickly said yes . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's an awfully thin case . . . at best , circumstantial , and I ca n't see any clear purpose to the whole play . " " It is n't over yet . But you can be sure that with a mix of Arabs , American oil interests , and the State Department at work , it 's not going to end up especially good for the Jews . " Zaslow carefully sipped his brandy . " And you can further be sure that the rest of what 's been happening will also turn out to be connected . I mean the surveillances , the scandals involving Jewish officials , the sudden ac- celeration of anti-Jewish and pro-Arab political adventurism . All of it . Every piece is cut from the same fabric . I ca n't pick out the common thread yet , but I know it 's there . Events take on a rhythm in something like this . There 's a timing , a mood quality you learn to sense after awhile . Sometimes you can almost smell it . And the stink of this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat without moving , as if fixed in a position he did not dare to change . " I think what bothers me most , is that nothing you tell me seems that incredible anymore . You 've infected me , Professor , and I do n't especially like the idea of taking on your disease . " " It 's not my disease . It 's an hereditary ailment . It comes with the blood . " " Maybe so . But I thought I had worked up a fairly creditable immunity . " Brandenburg stared broodingly at his host . " This country has been good to me , Dr. Zaslow . Damned good . It 's given me an education , money , a career in law , a place high in government . All right . So I 've known certain people called me a kike and a Jew bastard behind my back . So I 've known there were clubs I could n't get into . So what ? If I started feeling hurt and angry , I just worked harder , advanced my career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here is still the best around . But it does n't mean I 'm a fool or that I wo n't fight when threatened . " Zaslow said nothing and the presidential advisor got up and walked about the room , an elegant , pale-fleshed man in impeccable dinner clothes who had , just hours before , broken bread with the world 's leaders . " Actually , " he said , " I suppose I 've been fighting all along . " He sat down once more . But easing back into his chair with a sigh , he suddenly seemed to Zaslow like a tired , aging man , low in energy , full of doubts and premonitions , wanting only to be left alone with his old man 's reflections . Robert Arend began breathing the smell of money the moment he and Hartewell got out of the cab . There was a chauffeured limousine parked in front of the hotel entrance and an old woman in  | ermine was just entering it , trailing perfume behind , faint as the ghost of a jewel box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red flock on the walls , and gold leaf on the ceiling . Between the elevators stood a statue of Apollo surrounded by a bed of tulips which looked so artificial that Arend touched one and found it was real . James Benson turned out to be less imposing . Short and physically graceless , with heavy horn-rimmed glasses over a thin , pinched face , he looked like a hungry pawnbroker to Arend . Yet , welcoming them to his suite , what he represented turned him into something infinitely more . And it was n't even his own money , thought Arend . Hartewell introduced them , drinks were poured , and Benson settled right down to business . " My clients are pleased with your handling of the kidnapping backlash , " he said in a dry , flat voice . " Very pleased . They were quite worried for a while about its possible effect on the Arab image here . " He spoke directly to Hartewell but included Arend with small quick movements of his eyes . " In fact they feel you 've actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , " said Hartewell . " But if anything happens to those hostages , it 's a whole new ball game . " " Hopefully , nothing will happen to them . " " Well we ca n't really be sure of that , can we ? " " The bank has agreed to the Arabs ' terms . The ransom will be paid shortly . " " I read the newspapers too . But what else do you know ? " Benson looked at Hartewell without expression . " I mean let 's be realistic , " the party leader said . " Let 's remember whom we 're talking about . If these people are fanatical enough to pull a stunt like this , they 're fanatical enough to murder their hostages . " " Why would they do that ? " Hartewell shrugged . " Any number of reasons . To avoid being identified , out of simple vengefulness , or even some misguided pledge to Islam . Who knows ? All I 'm saying is that when you 're dealing with a bunch of crazies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax . " 143  | Benson offered them cigars , then lit one himself . He said nothing . " Even if the hostages are released , " Hartewell went on , " we 're not out of trouble . If this is successful once , you can be sure other Arabs will try it again . It always works that way . It can turn into a continuum of terrorist acts . And before it does , I think preparations should be made to deal with it . " " How ? " " With a whole new campaign . Concentrated . Intense . An all-out propaganda effort that will make full use of the media . The American public must be hammered with the idea that if terrorist acts are committed by Arabs , they are the work of only a few desperate individuals , driven to it by Israeli aggression and injustice and disavowed by responsible Arabs everywhere . At the same time , we would play up America 's economic dependence on Arab oil . Show Americans how their precious living standard can be hurt by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll very quickly be screaming to Washington to cut back Israeli aid . We 're like that . Give us a choice between practical economics and ideology , and we 'll grab for our material comforts every time . It 's endemic to our culture . We 've got two cars in every garage , we enjoy using them and we ca n't get them to move without fuel . That 's the theme we have to keep hitting . " " It sounds expensive . " " Compared with what 's at stake for your clients , it would be nickels and dimes . " Benson 's eyes flicked just once . " And exactly what do you think is at stake for my clients ? " " Oh , come on , Mr. Benson . We 're past the point of playing games . I do n't know or care who your people are , but I do know that no one puts that much cash into a fringe group like the American Renaissance Party out of pure patriotism . Which means your clients are backing us for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of with reason enough to spend all that money pushing the Arab cause in the United States , are American oil companies operating in the Mideast , and the Arabs themselves . Either way , the stakes 144  | run into the billions . So what 's a few hundred thousand more or less for insurance ? Benson smiled thinly . " You have a very orderly mind . But your premise could still be wrong . " " There 's always that possibility , " said Hartewell , and Robert Arend was impressed once again by his confidence . " If Arab money were involved , " said Benson , " would n't it bother you ? " " Not in the least . It works as well for us as any other kind of money . It 's giving us the chance to build our party and broaden its base . Finally , we have the organization we need . We 're reaching into all the right places , and people , are beginning to listen to us . Get us the additional money for that media campaign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more would you need ? " " For the next six months , two million above our current operating budget . " Benson laughed for the first time . " That 's all ? " " It 's still only nickels and dimes , Mr. Benson . " " I must say you take a very cavalier-like attitude with other people 's money . " Benson chewed for a moment on his cigar . " We 'll see . I might be able to get you half of that . " " No good . We did n't just pick a number out of the air . All costs were carefully estimated . Radio and TV spots , newspaper ads , magazine articles by good writers , P.R . releases to wire services . All on a national scale and all placed where they 'll do the most good . " Hartewell took a cluster of papers from a briefcase and handed them to Benson . " Here . You can see the figures for yourself . " Benson glanced briefly through the material . " All right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It wo n't do . It does n't work that way . Either you go all out and saturate with something like this , or you 're just throwing away time , effort and money . Believe me . I know what I 'm talking about . I 've been struggling and failing with half measures for years . And at best , the Arabs are a tough sell . My God , their avowed goal is the annihilation of Israel . Even the non-Jews in this country ca n't help feeling 145  | an affinity for a tiny , cultured democracy of less than three million souls , fighting for survival against three hundred million savage illiterates screaming for their blood . If your clients do n't already know that , you can inform them of it now . " Benson adjusted his glasses and looked once more at the papers in his hand . " You seem very confident that this can work . " " I am . Because I understand the ingredients of the situation . I know how our American psyche works . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our entire nation 's energy needs are being sacrificed because a pushy , vocal minority here has a racial tie with Israel , we 'll scream bloody murder . And before this campaign is through , I guarantee you 'll hear some screaming . " They left it there and the rest of the meeting was spent in going over the past month 's operating expenses , with Benson tight-lipped and fussy over several items until Arend explained them to his satisfaction . Hartewell remained in the background , letting his aide take over the housekeeping details that were a regular part of these auditing sessions . The high priest , thought Arend , inducting the acolyte into the mysteries of the order . Benson worked quickly and efficiently , missing nothing , humming tunelessly as he went over the long columns of figures . " Are you an accountant ? " Arend asked at one point . " That 's how I started . As a CPA . " " It shows . You really seem to enjoy it . " " I 've always enjoyed numbers . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . " Benson lifted his head and smiled and the light glinted from his glasses . " Sometimes I 'm certain the single biggest mistake of my life was leaving the practice of accountancy . " " You do n't seem to have done too badly . " " I suppose not , " said the investment counselor and went back to his numbers . Escorting them to the door later , he told Hartewell , " I 'm not promising anything , but I 'll do my best to get you what you need . " Hartewell was exultant as they left the hotel . Benson 's best , he 146  | felt , was as good as a commitment . He also felt it was American oil money they were getting , rather than Arab . Why would the Arabs spend their own cash , he reasoned , when they could put the squeeze on American companies dependent on them for their profits ? " Not that it really matters to us , " he told Arend . " Either way , we 'll get what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of the money being American . " The patriot , thought Robert Arend. 147  | Early on the eighth day , Issa brought in their breakfast as usual . " I have some good news for you , " he said . " If all goes well , you should be released by this evening . " Judi suddenly began to tremble . It was only the fifth day of the alloted ten , and up until this moment she had been absolutely certain she was unafraid . Terrill took her hand and held it . " It is all agreed , " said Issa . " At five o'clock this afternoon the money is to be picked up by two of our people . As soon as we hear that they are clear , you will be freed . " His eyes blinked through the slits in his mask . This was the first positive news he had brought them since the release terms were announced . Other than for his regular reassurances , he had told them only that negotiations were in progress . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you there was nothing to fear ? ' " Yes , you did , " said Judi , and was flooded with an insane rush of feeling for this polite , intense young man who had treated them so well under very difficult circumstances . " You 've been very kind . " Issa gestured awkwardly with his hands . " You embarrass me , Miss Haynes . I have kidnapped you at gun point , held you prisoner , threatened your life , and yet you call me kind . " " You might have been vindictive , but you never were . " 148  | " It was not a personal thing . " He stood there , a slender man with a pistol in his belt and a scholar 's droop to his shoulders . " We simply did what we believed had to be done . " Terrill started on his breakfast . " Did you handle the negotiations yourself ? " " No . None of us here had anything to do with that . But we were kept informed . " " What sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful ones . " " Could n't something go wrong ? " asked Judi . " We 've taken every precaution to see that it does n't . " Judi found herself with a new source of concern . " But what if the police lay a trap for your men ? Or follow them after they pick up the money ? " " The police have been warned to stay clear , " said Issa . " I 'm sure they will not jeopardize your safety with stupid heroics at this stage . " " Yes , but what if they do , " she insisted . " In that case they would have an extremely difficult time of it . We are neither fools nor amateurs . Please do not worry , Miss Haynes . " But as the day wore on , she did worry . Unwilling to admit fear before , she found herself oddly on edge now that freedom appeared so close . She said nothing about it , but suffered fantasies of violence in which Issa 's pistol was no longer in his belt but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the scar on back ) the muzzle pointing at her head . Wildly , she wondered if she would see his face before she was shot , or whether his mask would remain in place to the end . How embarrassed and regretful he would be . She could almost hear his apology as he was about to squeeze the trigger . Believe me , Miss Haynes , I never thought it would come to this . And what would she reply ? Oh , please call me Judi ? Her mind flirted with bits of remembered dialogue from some of her cinematic death scenes , ( she seemed to have died in an inordinate number of films ) but none seemed suitable . Then it struck her that she would be dying a lie and that perhaps , like an old-time pirate ship about to sail into battle , she should run up her true colors and cry , Shoot if you must this poor 149  | bleached head , but at least shoot it as a Jewish one , you miserable Arab bastard ! She noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstracted for much of the day , he began looking at his watch toward late afternoon . When their eyes met , he was always careful to smile reassuringly , but then glanced quickly away as if doubtful of his ability to remain convincing for any longer than a moment . Which shook Judi even more . It was the first time since they had been taken prisoner , that his presence alone had not been enough to support her confidence in their immediate future . At four o'clock they met in bed , as though by appointment , and made love . The infallible opiate , thought Judi , and felt the separate parts of her life and body weighted against those of the man beside her . His life up to this hour seemed to match her own , good to good , bad to bad , and they were equals . She opened her eyes and found his face again strong and sure above her . " Ah , darling , we 're just fine , are n't we ? " he said , and she smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms about him . The sun went down , but in the room the lamplight remained unchanged . She awoke slowly , reluctant to open her eyes . In bed , she knew everything was all right . Outside the bed , she had the feeling everything was wrong . Awareness arrived from unseen places . The impact opened a grave in her stomach . Then she forced open her eyes and saw Philip sitting across the room , fully dressed , watching her . " Hey , " he smiled . " You were really out . " " What time is it ? " " Six-thirty . " She was out of bed in a rush . " What 's happened ? Have you heard anything ? " " Nothing . Not a word . " " What about the radio ? " " They wo n't announce anything until we 're released . " He rose and kissed her . " Do n't worry . It 'll be all right . " When she had showered and dressed , she said , " Let 's call Issa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor 150  | below , and moments later the Arab leader unlocked the door and came in . " What 's wrong ? " Terrill asked . " I thought the money was supposed to be picked up at five o'clock ? " " That was only a target time . It does n't mean too much . Any number of things might have caused this delay . We 're not concerned . " " Then your people have n't contacted you ? " Issa shook his head and Judi searched his eyes , as if seeking a better answer there . Then she stared at the pistol in his belt . The idea of her own death remained as inconceivable as ever , but the pistol had suddenly begun to look more menacing . And where , she wondered , was Michael Zaslow in all this ? . . . where the legendary reach of Chai ? Were they really powerless to do anything , or had they simply written her off as expendable ? " I know the waiting is not easy , " said Issa . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything had gone wrong , we would have heard . " He left them and they sat listening to the seven o'clock news bulletins on the radio . Described in the clipped speech of a BBC newscaster , the Manchester football team had just had a win over their Birmingham rivals , a Soho man had shot his wife 's lover in front of their two young children , the Americans were sending an additional fifty thousand troops to Vietnam to offset the continuing build-up of Communist forces there , and the queen had caused a minor furor by naming the Beatles to her birthday honors list . At the close of the broadcast , the announcer said , " There is no further news of the two kidnapped Americans , although it is rumored that negotiations for their release have reached the critical stage . Officials of the Manhattan National Bank claim they can not issue any statements at this time for fear of jeopardizing the talks . " The radio was still on , but recorded music was playing when they heard the first shots . The firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from several directions at once . Then there were shouts , the sounds of shattering glass , and a dull explosion that shook the house and brought down fragments of plaster from the ceiling . Judi 's 151  | fingers dug at Philip Terrill 's arm . She knew it was probably a rescue attempt , but the whole thing seemed terribly confused and bungled , and she felt a dull resentment at its stupidity . Why could n't they have paid the ransom , freed them , and then gone after the Arabs ? Heroes , she thought , everyone had to be bloody heroes . Then the shooting stopped and there was a rush on the stairs and in the hall outside their room . The door was tried and someone called , " Terrill ? Are you people in there ? " " We 're here , " Terrill answered . " Get off to one side of the door . " Terrill drew Judi back against a wall , and a moment later the lock was blown off and they came in with their rifles and submachine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be American . The smell of gunpowder had turned the air blue , and Judi breathed and spoke with caution , assuring everyone she was all right , but certain she was going to be sick if they did n't get her out of there fast . A tall American introduced himself as Whitfield of the State Department and seemed to be in charge . After inquiring briefly about their condition and the number of kidnappers involved , he led them downstairs . " This is n't going to be pleasant , " he said , " but I 'm afraid you 're going to have to identify these people for us . " The lower part of the house was a shambles . Windows had been shot out , walls and furniture riddled , and there was shattered glass everywhere . They had placed the bodies side by side on the floor , where they lay like three bundles of old clothes . Judi looked as far as their shoes and no farther . " Were there just the three of them ? " Whitfield asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Judi nodded . Her eyes had now gotten as far as Issa 's chino trousers and she saw the first bloodstains . " And these are the men who kidnapped and held you captive ? " " This is the first time we 're seeing their faces , " said Terrill . " They always wore masks . But these are the men . " " You 're certain ? " 152  | " It 's their clothing and the way they were built . " " Miss Haynes ? " Judi did not answer . She was still staring at Issa 's trousers . " I 'm sorry , Miss Haynes , " said Whitfield . " I know this is n't easy for you . But I 'm afraid it 's a necessary formality . " " Why did you have to do it this way , " she said flatly . " Why could n't you have waited until the money was paid and they had freed us ? Maybe then you would n't have had to kill them . " " We could n't take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release you as promised . " Feeling herself about to go off a high place and sensing the drop beneath , Judi looked at Issa 's face . It was unmarked and very young . His eyes were closed and the long , dark lashes , curling over his cheek , gave the upper part of his face a curiously girlish and vulnerable expression . She glanced briefly at Fawzi and Abu . " These are the three men , " she said , and let herself look at Issa once more . He lay with his arms straight at his sides , and she was staring at the back of his right hand where he had the small red scar . Except that there was suddenly no red scar there . The hand was unmarked . I 've made a mistake , she thought dully . This is n't Issa . It 's Fawzi or Abu . They must have switched clothing . But when she looked at the hands of the others , no scars were there either . Something bad must have shown in her face , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Haynes ? " " No , " she said . " I think I 'm going to be sick . " And she was . Whitfield rode with them on the drive back to London . Philip Terrill was quiet and withdrawn and Judi said little , but the Assistant Secretary seemed anxious to talk . He apparently wanted it understood that although the CIA had laid most of the groundwork , it had been his own personal contacts that had brought about the final break in the case along with its attendant surprises . It appeared , Pembroke Whitfield informed them , that they had not really been kidnapped by the PLM at all , but by the Israelis , in an ingenious attempt to place the blame on the Arabs . In fact their three captors had actually been Israeli Intelligence agents . The ransom money had 153  | probably been lost , but this was surely a small enough price to pay for such valuable results . Whitfield talked on , making his small , human noises in the cool darkness of the speeding limousine . Judi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness after that . Too many things had happened too quickly , and she was far too tired and confused to make much sense of them . But she did n't really have to , she thought . That would be Michael 's part of it , not hers . 154  | Because of the five-hour time difference , it was not quite to P.M. in New York when Zaslow received the telephone call from London . The call came to his apartment and Kate was in the room with him as he listened , carried on a brief , coded conversation , then slowly put down the receiver . She had been watching his face . She had also heard his end of a rather innocuous discussion about a book deal . In no way did the two go together . " Is anything wrong ? " she asked . " No . Just business . " They had been relaxing with music and a late drink . The call had cut in like a siren . " Ca n't you tell me about it ? " " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He smiled and kissed her , but she would not be put off that easily . " Do n't you trust me yet ? " " It has nothing to do with trust . " " That 's not true . " He was silent . " Do you really think I could know and love you all this time , " she said , " and not have some idea of what you were doing ? " Something flat had settled into her voice . " I do n't know details , but it 155  | seems pretty obvious that you 're involved in a lot more than just working for a publishing company . You have to be . You 're too obsessed with this whole thing for it to be any other way . " " What whole thing ? " She seemed about to answer angrily , then sighed and went along with it . " What I 've heard you describe as the greatest hatred in human history . What I found so disturbing when I first listened to you speak that day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave alone since . You do n't know it , but I 've been reading everything I could find on the subject . And the more I read , the more frightening it gets . I thought after the Holocaust the world had finally learned where it could lead and would profit . Well , I was wrong . I know that now . " " What changed your mind ? " " There are signs . " " What sort of signs ? " Her eyes were cool . " The arrogant self-righteousness of certain Western leaders and the cynicism of others . The epidemic of scandals involving prominent Jews . The increasingly weighted balance against Israel at the U.N . and the growing importance of Arab oil . The expanding lunatic fringe in this country and the growing restrictions against Jews in Russia . Anti-Semitism seems to have become fashionable again everywhere . Even the audacity of that Arab kidnapping in England seems part of the general climate . " Kate revolved her glass in a small circle , stirring the liquor , driving away an invisible curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " is that I 've begun to understand at least a little of the way you feel . And in understanding , I 've realized you 're not the kind to just talk without doing . I 've also pieced together a few things . Phone calls that do n't make much sense . Sudden trips you take without mentioning them . The way you look at moments when I catch you off guard . Your reaction to being surprised somewhere . Maybe not much when taken separately , but together , forming a definite picture . " Zaslow was beginning to feel a curious glow . The liquor had enclosed him , a golden chariot lined with velvet . " What sort of picture ? " 156  | " Of a man swimming in dark waters with just the tip of his nose and a smile showing . I know something of your background , Michael . What you did in the war . What you 're capable of doing . You 're not just a prattling theorist . What you believe in , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other Jews who act in support of their beliefs , who quietly fight the Devil in whatever way they can . Yet strangely , I 've never heard you once mention them . It 's as if they did n't exist for you , and that could n't possibly be . Because if anyone would know about them , you would . " " Would you believe me if I said I knew of no such group ? " " Of course . The same way I 'd believe Lucky Luciano saying he 'd never heard of the Mafia . " Zaslow laughed . " It 's not funny , " she said . " You 're shutting me out of the most important part of your life and I do n't want to be shut out . Not only because I love you , but because I want to help . " He refilled both their glasses and said nothing . " Is it because I 'm not Jewish ? Is that why you wo n't trust me ? " " I trust you as much as anyone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he knew this was not so . And an uneasiness flew in , silent as a bat , and he could feel her receding from him . When she kissed him good night , her lips were cold . Too bad , he thought , yet knew that if anything was spoiled it had been spoiled from the beginning . Finally , it had to come to this . He could n't have it both ways . He would have had to either shut her out of his life at some earlier point , or else be willing to accept her knowing . Unfortunately , she was too smart . But then he had never yet been able to fall in love with a fool . Alone , there were more immediate things to consider . The call had not been from Judi , but from her London contact . At least Judi was safe . That much was good . The rest was not so good . His first call was to Dov Shimkoff in Jerusalem , where it was 5:30 AM , although it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spoke in code . When it was definitely established that the three dead Israelis were indeed Shimkoff 's missing agents , Dov 's voice thickened and he swore softly . He recovered as they talked on , ' 57  | but an edge of pain mixed with guilt remained , as though he somehow blamed himself for the loss of his men . The traditional weakness of Jews as soldiers , thought Zaslow . Each casualty was a tragedy , a deep personal loss . It made war doubly painful for the survivors . His next call was to Howard Mercker , whom he pulled away from a bridge game without explanation or apology . Mercker arrived shortly before midnight and Zaslow immediately filled him in . " Lovely , " he said when Zaslow had finished . " I can imagine tomorrow 's papers . " " That 's the least of it . The big question is Washington . We can assume now that Whitfield was involved from the beginning . That would explain his slip on Lewellyn 's tape . But how high up does the involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course we have n't yet come to the question of our friend , Philip Terrill . " " Do we assume he was part of it too ? " " We do n't assume anything . But right now I 'd tend to say yes . It was all carried off too smoothly . The timing was too perfect not to have had his cooperation . " " I do n't think so , " said Mercker . " Why not ? He 's up to his ears in Mideast oil . With billions involved , what better way to demonstrate his friendship and insure his most favored status with the Arabs than to lend himself to their little charade ? " " Why would he take Judi with him ? " Zaslow allowed himself a smile . " Seriously , " said Mercker . " With that much at stake it would seem like a very foolish move . And Terrill is anything but a foolish man . If he were in on the plan , I doubt that he would deliberately take a woman along . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment to his wife . " " Maybe . But it could also be his insurance against any accusations of collusion . I think he took Judi with him because with his alleged kidnappers dead , he would need someone as a witness , someone who could confirm him as an innocent victim . And the fact that his witness was a well known figure in her own right , rather than simply his wife , would only add to her credibility . But we 'll know 158  | more about that when Judi gets back . In the meantime , we have a busy schedule ahead . " They stayed at it through most of the night , making calls and sifting possibilities until Zaslow left to catch an early morning flight to Washington . He thought it best that he be there when the news broke . And the first one he wanted to see was Charles Brandenburg . The news arrived too late to make the morning papers , but was carried by all the wire services . . . first , as a flash bulletin , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newscasts . There was no mention of Pembroke Whitfield or , for that matter , of any American involvement . The rescue operation was credited entirely to Scotland Yard and British Intelligence , working together through their own undercover contacts . The exposure of the dead kidnappers as Israeli Intelligence Agents was given greater attention than the fact that their two hostages had been rescued unharmed . At this point there was little editorial comment . Although several newscasters did indicate their expectation that a further heightening of tensions in the already tense Mideast was sure to result from the surprise announcement . Naturally , thought Zaslow . He was listening to the bulletins in a Hertz rental as he drove toward Washington from the airport . Earlier , he had called Brandenburg at home , using a previously agreed upon code to arrange their meeting . With the presidential advisor still under surveillance , no contact could be treated simply . This time they were to meet at the Shoreham , in a room reserved under the name of Wilson . Zaslow made certain he arrived at the hotel half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany , followed a bellhop and his bag to a ninth floor room , and settled in to wait . Delayed tiredness hit him like a drug and he half dozed , his mind a controlled clutter of doubts , suspicions , and random facts . He thought of Kate , and in his weariness cherished her deeply , aching to protect her from hurt but knowing it was too late for any such hope . Like a young man he whispered her name aloud and imagined her close by , wanting her more at that moment 159  | than he had thought he could ever want any woman again . He thought of Judi Haynes and the ordeal to which he had unknowingly exposed her , and wondered dimly on such things as love , loyalty , and dedication . But mostly , he was aware of a sense of impending crisis . He had been traveling a long time through dark places , but knew he was arriving someplace now . He had just fallen asleep when a heavy knocking wakened him and he stumbled to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you sleep at all last night ? " " I 'm all right . Just give me a minute . " He went into the bathroom and splashed cold water on his face . When he returned , Brandenburg was standing at the window , staring down at the inevitable surveillance car in the street below . " They probably think I 'm having a wild affair , " he said . Zaslow sat down heavily . The idea of Charles Brandenburg engaged in any sort of wild affair , sexual or otherwise , struck him as both sad and comic . He was even touched , briefly , with compassion for the man . The hurt loneliness of the betrayed husband . " I 'm sorry to pull you down here like this , but there are some things I must tell you before you go to your office . How much do you know about the kidnapping rescue ? " " Only what I heard on the early newscasts . " " Then you have n't spoken with the President yet this morning ? " Brandenburg left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one from the State Department called you at home ? " " No . All I 've heard so far is that Terrill and the woman are safe and that their kidnappers turned out to be Israeli agents . Incredible ! How could Jerusalem have done anything that foolish ? " " They did n't . The whole thing was a set-up . There were three dead Israelis , all right , but they were shot and left there especially for that purpose . " " How do you know ? " " I ca n't tell you that , but I know . And I also know that Pembroke Whitfield led the rescue theatrics with an almost entirely American cast . But that 's something I 'm sure you 'll hear in detail when you get to the office . What you undoubtedly wo n't hear is that 16o  | the entire operation was a fake . And you also wo n't hear who planned it and why . " Brandenburg just sat there , his lined face suddenly strained and tight , the sweat gathering in beads over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our friend Whitfield . And since he would n't initiate something like this himself , it means Williams was also involved . " " And Philip Terrill . " " Probably . " " And the President , " said Zaslow . Brandenburg sighed . " I 'm reluctant to believe that . " " I do n't blame you . So am I. But we both know Williams is no policy maker . Besides , he 'd never have the courage to launch an operation like this on his own . His major contribution was probably his long-standing acquaintance with Terrill . " " What about the CIA ? " " I 'm sure they had their usual role . But not as policy makers . Something like this could never even get off the ground without the President 's knowledge and approval . " There were forces at work in Brandenburg 's face but he willed them still . His discipline was total . He had not won what he won for nothing . " If you 're right , " he said slowly , " then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did n't know what was going on . Zaslow said nothing . " And of course you 're certain it would have to do with my being Jewish . " " Have you ever been shut out of a high-level operation before ? " " Not that I 'm aware of . " " Then can you really believe it 's just coincidence that the first time you are shut out , it should involve what is obviously an antiIsraeli action ? " " Israel is a sovereign state . A foreign political entity . No more , no less . Actions taken for or against it do not automatically comprise actions for or against the Jewish people . " " Technically , maybe not . But ... " 161  | " No buts ! " Brandenburg cut in sharply . " Not a single blessed but . Italy is a Catholic country . When the United States went to war against her in 1941 , we went to war against the Italian state , not the Catholic people . Why should the fact that Israel happens to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because she is different . Because anti-Semitism happens to be a far more universal disease than anti-Catholicism . Also , because Israel is the first Jewish state the world has seen in two thousand years , the Promised Land to an historically homeless people , a source of hope and pride to every Jew in the world . " " That 's a lot of Zionist pap . Personally , I have no greater feeling for Israel than I do for any friendly foreign power . And the President understands that . He knows my allegiance is solely to this country and to this country 's interests . If he did n't have implicit faith in that fact , why would he have appointed me in the first place ? " " Well , I do have one possible theory , " said Zaslow . " Could n't he have appointed you for the very fact that you are a Jew ? " " Why would he do that ? " " I 'm not sure . But are n't there a fair number of gentiles around who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unaware of your reputation , but no one is totally unique . No one is totally above all others in brilliance and ability . No one is ever the only person for a particular job . Considering this , plus the fact that you were never a personal friend of the President 's , would n't it have seemed more logical for him to have appointed some nice , brilliant , uncontroversial non-Jew to so high and sensitive a post , rather than someone vulnerable to prejudice and suspicion ? Why , given a choice , would he have deliberately picked a Jew ? Unless , of course , it was to serve some ultimate purpose . " " What sort of ultimate purpose did you have in mind ? " " There are two possibilities . The first would involve your being used as the traditional Jewish scapegoat , the sacrificial lamb that could draw attention away from whatever the White House might want to keep hidden . The second concept would spotlight you as the President 's prime , showcase Jew , his personal insurance against all future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very 162  | prominence of your position would be an essential part of whichever comedy happened to be chosen . " " What are you expecting ? A federally sponsored pogrom ? " Zaslow did not smile . " You know I 'm always expecting a pogrom . You also know how I feel about all the surveillances , the political hate-mongering , and the scandals involving Jews . Now we come to the most overt act of all ... the murder of three Israeli agents and a top-level conspiracy to smear mud on Jerusalem . Which more than ever makes me believe everything is tied together . The only thing that 's still missing is the overall motive . And I think the answer to that is buried somewhere in the Oval Office . " Brandenburg rose impatiently . He seemed about to say something , then changed his mind . He looked angry , then thwarted , then worried . " I suppose what you 're telling me now is that I 'm the one who has to start digging for it . " " It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you are the closest to it . In the meantime , I 'll still be doing all I can . " " I 'm sure you will , " said Brandenburg . He still seemed angry and frustrated when he left . Zaslow had room service send him up a sandwich and coffee , which he gulped down and considered his lunch . Then he left the hotel , drove across the Arlington Memorial Bridge , and headed north . Watching the rear-view mirror , he saw George Lewellyn 's gray Chevrolet appear behind him and follow at a fifty-yard interval . After a while they turned off onto a side road , drove a short distance , and parked at the edge of a pine grove . It was a bright day and the tops of the trees stood sharp and clear against the sky . There was a stream beside the road and the water glinted in the sun . Zaslow sat staring at it until Lewellyn joined him in his car . They shook hands warmly . " How are things going ? " Zaslow asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lewellyn grinned . " Our biggest problem right now is deciding whether or not to have another kid . Marilyn says yes , but Fin not so sure . " " How does Mickey feel about it . " " Fie likes things the way they are . Why not ? An only child has it made . " 163
