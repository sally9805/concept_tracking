BOULANGER by James Harding . 251 pages . Scribners. $8.95 . <P> <P> He is remembered as the original of that perennial threat to shaky governments , " the man on horseback . " Adoring crowds threw themselves on the tracks at the Gare de Lyon to keep him from leaving Paris . Three hundred songs were written about him , and copies by the thousands were hawked in the streets . Fast-selling lines of dishes , pens and bric-a-brac carried his portrait to the consuming public . On Bastille Day 1886 , when he rode down the Champs-Elyses on his great black horse , all France lay at his feet . Indeed , on three occasions General Georges Ernest Jean Marie Boulanger had only to stroll to the Elyse Palace and the government of France would have been his . Each time , mysteriously , he drew back . <P> In 1891 , after Boulanger shot himself over his mistress 's fresh grave , his former political patron , Georges Clemenceau , produced a suitably cruel epitaph . " Boulanger , " sneered the Tiger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , in the first complete biography of Boulanger , English Historian and Musicologist James Harding offers to set the record straight . Sexual infatuation as well as drugs , he concedes , played a part in the general 's rise and fall . Poor and provincial , Boulanger was wounded six times in battle before becoming a general in the French army at the comparatively young age of 42 . The last of his many mistresses , the Vicomtesse de Bonnemains , began giving him nightly doses of morphine to ease the pain of old wounds ; as a result , he grew both melancholy and erratic . Yet , Harding shows , it was soldierly scruple that really lay behind Boulanger 's retreat from power . <P> Puppet Show . In the later years of the 19th century , the Third Republic could rarely be described as a working democracy . Haunted by France 's humiliating defeat in the war of 1870 enraged clericals and anticlericals , lurking royalists and Bonapartists , wild radicals and Republicans turned the parliamentary process into a dismal puppet show . Chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligently democratized , reorganized and re-equipped France 's demoralized army . Like Dwight David Eisenhower in 1952 , he became , almost overnight and with little effort on his part , the center of a whirlwind political force . " Boulangism " offered not politics but panaceas . Resurrect Gallic glory . Restore the lost provinces . Inaugurate an income tax . Give France a powerful presidency ( which another general would do in 1958 ) . Whatever it was , the general 's adherents suggested , Georges would do it . <P> In the name of order and authority , Georges seemed willing to try . What he would not do , as it turned out to everyone 's surprise , was risk the disorder of civil war and bloodshed , however brief . When Boulanger was about to be overwhelmingly elected Deputy on a national ticket , an aide routinely asked him : " Will you sleep in the Elyse , or will you have the Chamber of Deputies invaded ? " " Are you mad ? " Boulanger replied . On the eve of the expected coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowds and troops stood ready for his word to march . Boulanger simply retired to his bed , taking Marguerite de Bonnemains with him .
