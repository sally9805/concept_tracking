txt Harry Poulson points to his receding hairline . " Do you know , " he says , " I can get a wig  --  a new one each year , costing up to 1,000 kroner ( about $165 )  --  and the Danish state will pay for it ? " Mr. Poulson , manager of an electricalappliance shop , smiles and shakes his head . He is losing patience with the latest wrinkles in the welfare state . When it comes to the politicians , he is wearily Indifferent . " I am not interested in the political parties any more , " he says . " I am 60 years old and I have seen so many of them . . . . They say one thing before the election , and when they come to the throne it is quite otherwise . " Democracy is going through difficult days in Denmark . The voters are in rebellion . Party membership is falling steadily . Worried politicians still are trying to decipher the reaults of last December 's elections , in which all five of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Folketing ( parliament ) while five others parties captured seats . " We Surrender " Most disconcerting is the solid voter support ( 28 seats out of 179 ) that went to the brand new " Progressive " Party of Mogens Glistrup . Mr. Glistrup is a wealthy lawyer who waved his income-tax return before viewers on Danish television , explaining that he paid zero tax due to clever avoidance techniques . He campaigned for elimination of the income tax within five years ' and once Said also that he would replace the defense ministry with a recorded telephone message saying " we surrender " in Russian . " I voted for that man , " says Erik Paulsen , owner of a camera shop here , " and I would vote for him again . It 's not that I thought he could do what he said he could do . I did it as a demonstration . " Price inflation , the high rate of personal income tax and the cost of running the welfare state seem to be the chief issues rankling the voters . The dispersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the business of government more arduous . " It is all rather depressing , " says Niels Helveg Petersen , a deputy from the Radical Liberal Party . Governments are having trouble all around Western Europe . Social Democrats , long the major force in Scandinavia , are losing ground in Sweden and Norway as well as in Denmark . Britain has a minority government after a confusing general election . Chancellor Willy Brandt , whose Social Democrats are slipping in West Germany , is said to be fearful that the days of freewheeling democracy in Europe may be numbered . The Most Bizarre Nowhere is the situation more bizarre than in Denmark . Prime Minister Poul Hartling 's Liberal Party holds only 22 of the 179 seats in the parliament , and he governs with the sufferance of three other parties , the Social Democrats , the Democratic Center and the Christian Peoples Party . " We must have a majority on every vote , " Mr. Hartling explains . He is a relaxed man of 59 with wavy gray hair , previously a Lutheran minister , head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheerful about his situation ( though he has acknowledged that to survive he must always think first about not losing parliamentary battles , rather than about winning them ) . " You must remember , we are used to having minority governments , " Mr. Hartling says . Coalitions of two or three parties have been the rule in Denmark for several decades . Now , the prime minister points out , " you must have three or four parties , sometimes five , to have a majority . " But is n't it alarming to see the voters turning away from the established parties ? Mr. Hartling contends that it is healthy ( though his own party lost eight seats in the election ) . " In all elections there should be some sort of rebellion , " ho says . " That is the right of the people . There is something vivid about democracy . " However , Hans Jorgen Nielson , an associate professor at Copenhagen University 's Institute of Social Science , finds some disquieting trends among the Danish electorate . He points to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Democrats , the biggest party , had 259,000 members in 1960 . As of last year they had 160,000 . " The situation is quite the same in some of the other parties , " says Prot . Nielsen . Another trend is changes in party membership . Up to 15% of the electorate may change parties between general elections . " We have gone front a nominally stable sittuition to an unstable one , " Mr. Nielsen say . The parties clearly are failing to project Individual - or satisfactory  --  philosophies to the voters . " l'eople ca n't see any structure in politics , " Mr. Nielsen says . He notes that poll . tics once were stable in the north of Europe and turbulent in the south . Now he wonders if the situation is reversing , or if the north , in any case , is beginning to behave like the south . Mr. Hartling , the prime minister , is willing to concede some basic sources of discontent . He sees It in " the changing structure of our community " from " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that context , the small ahopkeeper , a hard worker , sees the factory worker moving past him , while he is saddled with ever more forms to fill out , higher salaries to pay his helpers and more taxes to pay to the state . " He feels himself a slave of the community , " the prime minister says . " He has a feeling of being left alone , left behind . " There is another factor : Has the welfare state " outgrown itself , " as contended by Mr. Paulsen , the camera store owner ? He sees " a government that is trying to play nursemaid to everybody , " and he yearns for " the freedom of the individual to decide whether he wants to sleep in a golden bed or in the gutter ? ' Paying Their Own Bills Mr. Horning is aware that " social welfare is carried to a very high point , and people are beginning to criticize this . " He notes that in the glorious early days of socialism It was possible to " let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " we have reached the point where we all have to pay for ourselves . " Mr. Paulsen notes that some old noble families now have to rent their land for hunting or show their castles to tourists to meet expenses . " Today 's nobility are the public officials , " he says . " They get paid more than anybody . " The number of public servants has grown from 235,763 in 1960 to 539,700 in a recent tabulation  --  and every Dane is acutely aware that his taxes pay their salaries . Mr. Glistrup , leader of the upstart Progressive Party , made much capital during the election campaign by talking about " the public popes at their desks . " But the biggest source of - discontent clearly is the rate of personal income tax , which takes 35% to 40% of the average worker 's wages . " Even Sweden , which has been the home of the income tax , has been overtaken by us , " says Mr. Petersen of the Radical Liberal Party . Deterring Initiative The problem is that personal income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public programs . Other governments make more liberal use of social security contributions by employers , for instance . Mr. Hartling believes that the rate of tax ? " especially when people earn something more " ? is deterring individual initiative . " There are so many instances where they earn 100 more kroner and their new taxes are 110 or 120 kroner " because they move into higher tax brackets , he says . Arne Lund , chairman of the Danish Employers Federation , says flatly that " wage earners in Denmark would prefer having their income taxes reduced to having their nominal wages increased . " To make the changes soon that the voters seem to want is clearly impossible . As one politician points out , the voters ' attitude is " not very logical  --  not very rational . " Surveys show that Danes want to keep just those welfare-state programs that cost the most money . But they want to pay less for them . Telling the Unpopular " It is impossible to deliver the goods that the people want now , " declares Mr. Petersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Social Democratic Party ( which went from 70 parliamentary seats to 46 in the December election ) , thinks that all the parties have been " talking and talking and talking , and acting too little . " Now , he says , they must do something to " re-establish confidence between the voters and the politicians . " The politicians , he says , have a two-part task : " Listen ; and tell the truth , including the unpopular things . " Says Mr. Lund : " We need five , maybe 10 , years , in which we stop the politicians from introducing new programs , while those who work in the private sector are allowed to keep more of the profits of what they are doing .
