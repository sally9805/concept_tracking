GO TELL THE SPARTANS <P> Directed by Ted Post <P> Screenplay by Wendell Mayes <P> This unpretentious movie about a group of American " advisers " in Viet Nam in 1964 , before the war was thoroughly Americanized , has the virtues of its defects . It is understated , lacking in powerful dramatic incident and high human emotion , and rather flatly written and directed . As a result , it has about it a realistically antiheroic air that is rare enough in any movie about any war , and a grubby brutality that matches memories of the news film that came out of Southeast Asia in the ' 60s and did so much to disgust the nation with U.S. involvement there . <P> Burt Lancaster , who has been playing veteran soldiers since long before he became a veteran actor , is in command of the American detachment and in solid command of the best starring role he has had in years ( he was , of course , , he gives us a portrait of a dutybound professional whose soldierly instincts tell him that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , but disgust is not . Lancaster 's presence , carrying with it the memory of other wars ( and a different sort of war movie ) , provides a kind of bench mark against which to measure the distance we have traveled from our former attitudes about the military necessity . <P> His problems here are an ill-equipped and ill-motivated local soldiery ( they go into battle carrying shotguns ) , the corruption of the local district leader , a high command that does n't understand the nature of guerrilla warfare , and a less-than-inspiring crowd of American helpers . Among them : A sergeant whose gung-ho spirit has been burned out in the war . A lieutenant who moronically parrots-because he moronically believes-all the official rationales for the war , all the official ideas of how to conduct yourself on this dark and bloody ground . A sometime college student one suspects of having literary ambitions-he 's looking for a war , any war , merely to experience it . These soldiers are mostly seen not as brutes , but as decent if limited men doing their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reoccupy and defend a former French outpost called Muc Wa , which they do successfully until there is an inexplicable change in strategy and they are forced to withdraw into ambush and massacre . The picture is good at catching the absurdity and futility of the operation , but in the long siege-and-retreat sequence , Director Post 's failure to rise above simple realism becomes a problem . The scenes here should be spookier and more suspenseful , imparting a developing sense of the madness of isolation in an alien land where the native enemy has all the advantages of terrain and bred-in-the-bones knowledge of it . There are hints of an effort in this direction ( Muc Wa contains a cemetery for the French troops who died trying to defend it , with an inscription about the Spartans at Thermopylae that provides the picture 's title ; there is a one-eyed Viet Cong sniper who appears and disappears in a ghostly fashion ) , but they are never really developed .                    @
