So determined is Israel to nail down assurances of U.S. support before entering peace negotiations with the Arabs that Washington often grows downright uneasy . As Premier Golda Meir told a Labor Party rally in Tel Aviv last week , U.S. Ambassador Walworth Barbour recently said to her : " Look here , Mrs. Meir , we 've established that Israel is not a satellite of the U.S. Now I think we ought to make it clear that the U.S. is not a satellite of Israel . " With a smile , Golda told the party members : " I had no choice but to agree . " <P> To emphasize its independence , Washington last week served as a scrupulously impartial host to distinguished visitors from both sides . In visits that barely missed overlapping , Jordan 's King Hussein and Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan called at the White House and met Secretary of State William Rogers and Defense Secretary Melvin Laird . Both visitors stressed their willingness to join the peace talks to be held under the aegis of United Nations Mediator Gunnar Jarring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military items , should the talks fail to get off the ground . <P> Land or Peace . Hussein was received with particular warmth because three months ago he spared the U.S. a difficult decision . When a Syrian armored force invaded Jordan to aid Palestine guerrillas in their battle with the King 's army , both the U.S. Sixth Fleet and Israeli forces were poised to intervene on Hussein 's side . But the King 's tanks and planes repelled the Syrians . The U.S. , which is already acting on a $30 million allotment to re-equip the Jordanian army , listened to requests by Hussein for additional equipment that could bring the bill to $200 million . <P> Hussein also asked the U.S. not to back down on its stand that Israel must " substantially " withdraw from occupied territories . " Israel must choose land or peace , " the King told the National Press Club . " She can not have both . " He agreed , however , thai " if there is a need , we would conceivably accept minor rectifications on a reciprocal basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unexpectedly subdued . He stressed that Israel is prepared to re-enter the Jarring talks before the cease-fire expires in February . The talks will be based on a 1967 Security Council resolution that calls for both a return of territory captured in the Six-Day War as well as the establishment of secure borders . What Dayan wanted was U.S. reassurance that it would veto any Russian attempt to introduce a new resolution stressing only territories . Washington was noncommittal , but did indicate that it is ready to fill an Israeli shopping list that runs to $500 million in military aid over the next two years . The list is so detailed that Laird , only half kidding , has declared : " These guys want stuff I never even heard of . "
