THE BOOK OF FIRSTS <P> by PATRICK ROBERTSON 256 pages . Clarkson Potter . $10 . <P> <P> There are some books whose reviews should run upside down . They are the volumes which mainly add up to a series of short answers-tomes like the Guinness Book of World Records or the Baseball Encyclopedia . Seven hundred twenty-three home runs ; 895 miles below sea level-these are the replies such works elicit from the reader . The rest is merely a salaam to accuracy and arcana . Joining the shelf of unique reference books is another first : the first Book of Firsts by Patrick Robertson . A British civil servant , indefatigable researcher and humorist very much manque , Robertson has highly individual criteria for celebrity . Not for him the Joe Namaths , Henry Kissingers or Valerie Perrines of this world . The Robertson laurels go to " Manchester Jack , " the first lion tamer ( 1835 ) ; M. Jolly-Bellin , first dry cleaner ( 1849 ) ; William Kemmler , first man to die in the electric chair ( 1890 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato chip ( 1853 ) . Surrounding these immortals is a pantheon of some 6,000 achievers and achievements , each one a monument to ingenuity or perversity . En masse , they provide the best argument settler since the first dictionary ( Cawdrey 's Table Alphabeticall , 1604 ) . After The Book of Firsts , there should be no further disputes about any of the following : a ) the identity of the first magazine ; b ) the inventor of the first contraceptive ; c ) the first woman jockey ; d ) the first sporting event ever televised . Now if only there were a compilation of coffee-table non-books entitled The Book of Lasts . . . <P> <P> a ) Mercure Galant , Paris , 1672 ; <P> b ) Gabriel Fallopius , Padua , circa 1550 ; <P> c ) Alicia Meynell , York , England , 1804 ; <P> d ) baseball , between the Ushigome and Awazi Shichiku Higher Elementary Schools , Tokyo , 1931 . <P> Stefan Kanfer                @ @ @ @ @
