WELCOME TO ANDROMEDA and VARIETY OBIT by RON WHYTE <P> More evenings than not , that aisle-anchored creature the drama critic peers out over a becalmed stage , stagnant characters and dialogue indistinguishable from soggy debris . But on occasion the sight of fresh and genuine talent greets his eye , and the stage seems to quiver with dramatic life . <P> Such a talent is Ron Whyte , 27 , who is making his playwriting debut with these two off-Broadway playlets . Let 's mark him for a dolphin who cavorts in drama as if it were his native element . He writes with humor , grace and eloquence , and he creates characters who refuse to leave the playgoer 's memory . <P> The lesser item , Variety Obit , is a kind of songs-and-patter snapshot history of the U.S. from the Puritans to the present as recorded by a vaudeville clan . While the music by Mel Marvin is pleasant and the lyrics by Bob Satuloff are plaintively evocative , the retrospective vision does not cohere . <P> Welcome to Andromeda is another matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ignominious errors . He is totally paralyzed except for his fingers and his head . His bed is a movable crypt . On his 21st birthday , his mother , a vampire bat whom we never see but whose oppressive presence empties the room of breathable air , has gone off to buy him some presents . She has left him in the care of a Southern nurse ( Bella Jarrett ) . She , it develops , is an alcoholic who once gave a patient the wrong medicine . He , it develops , wants the wrong medicine - death - as surcease from sorrow . He is caustic ; she is dumb . They are both anguished spirits , with a scarifying lack of control over the lethal game they are playing . <P> If one is to guess at Ron Whyte 's intent , it is that he wants us to look at two people spinning on the charred cinders of this planet who may be saying to themselves : " Look , the abyss over which you lean is yourself . The pain you feel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes you make as a fencer against fate merely underline your epitaph . " If so , the playwright may count his luck as equal to his talent , for one can scarcely imagine more gifted and sensitive actors than David Clennon and Bella Jarrett for conveying his purpose and his vision . <P> - :T.E.K.
