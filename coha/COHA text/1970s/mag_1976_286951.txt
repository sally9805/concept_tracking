SILENT MOVIE <P> Directed by MEL BROOKS Screenplay by MEL BROOKS , RON CLARK , RUDY DeLUCA and BARRY LEVINSON <P> Yes , it is really silent . There is music in Silent Movie , stray sound effects , and some title cards-just like in the days before Vitaphone-but no one utters a single word . Well , somebody does pronounce aloud one tiny monosyllable , but let no one step on a laugh by revealing either the word or the perpetrator . Just one caution : people may be laughing so hard all around you that , to hear the word , close attention will have to be paid . Silent Movie is brassy , incautious , funny without mercy . For laughter , Brooks gives no quarter , and he disdains the small change . As ever , he is out to break the bank . He comes as close as anyone in the vicinity to succeeding . Maybe even a little closer . <P> Daffy Asides . Silent Movie is welcome not the least for its audacity . Nobody makes silent movies any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Brooks , who began his career cooking up outrageous interludes for Sid Caesar , consorted with Carl Reiner in the creation of the splendidly garrulous 2,000 Year Old Man ( 2,013 on his last birthday ) , and made a group of antic movies ( Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein ) that needed dialogue for life 's blood . Brooks ' favorite weapon was the non sequitur ( mankind 's greatest invention , according to the 2,000 Year Old Man , was Saran Wrap ) . He also excelled at illogical logic and brassy , daffy asides , like the hermit in Young Frankenstein sulking because the monster had shambled off without sampling his espresso . <P> In Silent Movie , Brooks has put these devices aside , or worked to find purely visual equivalents : in a spicy Szechwan restaurant , where steam billows from the customers ' mouths and ears ; in a ro mantic fantasy number , featuring the bride and groom coming to life atop a wedding cake , tapping down the tiered layers and sinking in a swamp of frosting . There is a rambunctious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a pregnant passenger in the boot tips the balance and sends the MG down the street on rear axle power , looking like a bicycle on training wheels . <P> Desperate Scheme . The movie has to do with the efforts of a down-at-the-heels Hollywood director named Mel Funn ( portrayed , inevitably , by Brooks himself ) and his desperate scheme to save not just his own career but a major studio . Funn wants to make a silent movie , a comedy , of course . The studio chief ( Sid Caesar ) thinks Mel is nuts , but Mel , a pro , counters with the one blandishment proved irresistible to moguls on the ropes - movie stars . What if Funn and his two buddies ( Marty Feldman , Dom DeLuise ) are able to round up some of Hollywood 's brightest ? <P> As the unholy trio hits the well-manicured streets of Beverly Hills , struggling to recruit the likes of Paul Newman , Anne Bancroft , James Caan , Liza Minnelli and Burt Reynolds , the studio chief stews in his office , combatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devour . <P> That is all the plot there is . Brooks assumes that all he needs is a premise , and he may be right . The movie is a se ries of set pieces for Mel and the boys :
