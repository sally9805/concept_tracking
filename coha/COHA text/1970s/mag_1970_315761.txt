" Seventeen , this is five . Need your report immediately . Over . " <P> " Seventeen here . Busy now . Will send it later . Over . " <P> " This is five . Send immediately . Over . " <P> " Roger . Will do . Over . " <P> " Only let there be peace . " <P> THAT exchange between an Israeli headquarters in the Sinai and a fortress commander on the Suez Canal occurred during a thunderous Egyptian barrage early this year . The sign-off stuck , and radio calls to and from outposts on the canal now normally end with the words " Only let there be peace . " <P> In the 100-mile string of underground forts and minefields known as the Bar-Lev Line , after Israel 's chief of staff , peace seems remote . Running opposite Port Said in the north to a point opposite the city of Suez in the south , the line was finished only days before Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser renounced the cease-fire and launched his " war of attrition " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suez defense system as both a shield and a springboard . " Its day-to-day mission is to prevent a serious breaching of the canal , " he said last week . " But the system can easily be turned into a jump-ing-off point . " So far , however , only small commando raids have been launched . Heavily outgunned ( 10 to 1 ) , the Israelis are also outmanned . A lone Israeli division faces an Egyptian force perhaps ten times larger , yet so far has dissuaded Nasser from attempting a drive across Suez to regain a foothold on the Sinai Peninsula . Says Bar-Lev : " I think they will get tired before we will . " - <P> Relentless shelling , sniping and the searing Sinai sun make the Bar-Lev Line the hottest front in casualties and climate . There is no sweet smell of victory there , only the odors of cordite , of dead fish in the narrow canal ( a mere 80 yds. across at some points ) , of sweaty bunkers and boots left out to air . Yet plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve officer who chose duty on the line : " You can not argue in your living room unless you have taken part . " <P> Daily bombardments force soldiers to spend most of the time under the desert in the strongly fortified bunkers , emerging at night for patrols and showers when shelling slackens . Rookies invariably bring suntan lotion but go home white as cheese . They also find themselves wincing at auto backfires and occasionally even hurling themselves to the sidewalk out of habit . A week 's respite each month allows time for soaking up sun and satisfying other appetites . " Down there you just do n't think about sex , " says a reserve captain who spent three months at the front . " It 's probably the tension . " <P> Inside the sunken , multistory bunkers , equipped with electric lights , TV , foam-rubber mattresses and even disposable plastic mess gear , life becomes a routine of sitting out one artillery barrage after another . Dust blows off the dunes in gagging flurries and the heat is stifling , but the bunkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sturdy mixture of sand , concrete , timber and steel rails ripped up from the trans-Sinai line that even accurate salvos send little more than tremors below . The Suez defenders , who call themselves " moles , " pass the hours in the cramped forts cleaning their weapons and playing backgammon. -
