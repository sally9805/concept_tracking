txt The . West German mark , floating td find a new rate , was given a ; wary reception today as official European foreignexchange markets reopened after an extraordinary weekend of currency changes . The West German Government , feeling a fresh sense of purpose , turned to domestic problems as its new economic stability program went into effect . The $2-billion that surged into West Germany last week was in no hurry to flow out , The speculators who had bet on a higher value for the mark passed up the chance for quick profits today and decided to hang on despite German moves to discourage them . New Buying Felt Indeed , substantial new buying pushed the mark rate even further ahead , putting it 3.5 per cent above its former fixed value . Trading in unofficial markets Friday had revalued it at 3 per cent above the old rate . At the close of trading in London today , the mark was quoted at 28.3 cents , or 3.535 to the dollar . The fixed rate was 27.3 cents , or 3.66 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading seemed orderly and that " no immediate action by the United States is called for . " Page 64 . Predictions Made Some foreign-exchange dealers predicted that the mark would eventually be bid up to a level 5 or 6 per cent above its old parity and then " fixed " there . However , West German officials have argued that Germany 's foreign-payments position is not strong enough to permit a permanent increase in value , and they have predicted that the mark will come back down to its old rate after some months of floating . The advantage of floating is that the monetary authorities do not have to defend a fixed rate by buying up unwanted dollars at the expense of tightmoney policies at home . The marks bought today with dolJars Were bought from commercial banks and other private holders rather than from the Bundesbank , West Germany 's central bank . Dealers in London and Zurich , Switzerland , described trading as nervous and uncertain as the markets coped with the exceptional experience of two floating rates ( the German mark and the Dutch guilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrian schilling ) and a fifth rate freed for some transactions ( the Belgian franc ) . The chief trader for one of the big Swiss banks said , " We can not yet see things as clearly as we would like . ' The head of the foreignexchange department of the London branch of a big New York hank said : " The market has a way ' to go before it settles down . There 's no real trend yet . " The Dutch guilder , which was allowed to float along with the mark , was traded at rates about 2.5 per cent above its old par value . But the foreign-exchange market in Amsterdam remained closed unexpectedly , and trading was confused . Rates of 28,3 cents ( 3.53 to the dollar ) were quoted , compared with the par value of 27.6 cents ( 3.62 to the dollar ) . New Levels Set Of the two revalued currencies , the Swiss franc was increased by 7 per cent to 24.5 cents ( 4.08 to the dollar ) from 22.8 cents ( 4.3725 to the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent to 4,04 cents ( 24,75 to the dollar ) from 4.2 cents ( 26 to the dollar ) , The Belgian franc was affected by the decision to channel almost all foreign-exchange l:ransactions , except for legitimate trade commitments , into the floating section of Belgium 's two-tier foreign-exchange market . Swiss hankers acknowledged that the 7 per cent increase in the Swiss franc 's value had been a surprise . But they rationalized the step as a means of deflecting the dollar inflow ( by making the franc more expensive ) and leaving Switzerland free to cope with her price inflation by wielding high interest rates . However , there was a fair amount of buying of the more expensive francs , and the rate swung . between the extremes of 4.01 to the dollar and 4.16 before closing at 4.10 , near the new par level . Reason for Move Bankers in Zurich said the Government had decided on revaluation rather than following the German example and floating because of Swiss fears that floating rates bring " chaos and disorder . " The Swiss revaluation was seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German move appears as a twopronged attack , consisting of the floating rate and a stillundisclosed package of exchange-control measures , However , today the Germans did confirm reports that they would bar most payments of interest on foreign deposits , This means that dollar funds originally attracted to Germany because of interest rates higher than those in the Eurodollar market will receive no interest . Any profits must lie in capital gains in the value of the Germany currency . The increase in the value of the strong European currencies means a decrease in the value of the dollar to which they have been pegged .

Mark and Yen Firm Here The West German mark and the Japanese yen were notably strong on the New York foreign-exchange market yesterday , as traders tried to re-establish some sense of normality in their activity . The volume of trading , while high , was said to have been somewhat less than last week . The mark , which the German Government had announced would be allowed to float for the time being , closed here yesterday at 26.27 cents , after trading as high as 28.40 , during the day .
