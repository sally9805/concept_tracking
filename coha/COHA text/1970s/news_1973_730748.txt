" the transcript of Otto Kerner 's speech to the judge is on the back page . Dignity is the word to describe Kerner 's conduct thruout his trial and on the day of his sentencing . On the back page . United States Atty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved conclusion . " Story on page 3. the moral outrage felt by the people of the state of Illinois since they learned of their be. trayal by Gov . Otto Kerner , " Thompson said . Kerner and Isaacs were convicted of accepting an offer of racetrack stock at bargain prices in 1962 from Mrs. Marie Arlington Park and WashingEverett , former head of the ton Park racetracks . THEY WERE allowed to pay for some of the stock in 1966 at $1,000 a share when it was worth $6,000 per share . They were convicted of concealing their ownership of the stock by having it listed In the names of other persons , concealing from the Internal Revenue Service on their income tax returns the stock investment , and profits ; and influencing legislation and racing board appointments favorable to racing interests . William S. Miller , former IIlinois State Racing Board chairman , originally indicted with them , and Mrs. Everett , who provided the government with the information for the indictment , won immunity from prosecution by becoming government witnesses . Kerner , who had a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose father also sat on the United States Appeals Court , made a dramatic seven-page statement to Judge Taylor before sentencing . IT WAS N'T AN appeal for mercy , it was n't an appeal for leniency , it was more like an Otto Kerner position paper being issued at the end of a long day 's court hearings and at the conclusion of a seven-week trial of a complicated case . In the clipped English accent he acquired at Cambridge as a student , Kerner orated in the style which made him famous as governor , United States attorney , and county judge . He said he was shocked that bhe jury which came from the millions he had served as a public official would believe the , charges against him . He said he was disappointed they took so little time-15 hours over a , period of three days ? before reaching a verdict . " I SHALL NOT offer false repentence nor do I ask for any special leniency or mercy , " he said . " Nevertheless , I fear that the role of a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult and ht times virtually impossible for a man long in the public eye to receive fair treatment when accused of a crime , and to enjoy the presumption of innocence which protects other citizens . " Kerner went on to say that he never used his state office for personal profit , was innocent of all charges and that God knew this to be a fact . He vowed to continue his legal appeals and said he hopes eventually to be vindicated . His attorneys  --  Paul R. Connelly and Thomas A. Patton ? argued that a jail sentence for Kerner was unthinkable and Connelly said one day in a federal prison for Kerner would be " a terrible hell . " Patton urged the judge to consider Kerner 's whole life , " his whole character , his whole career , " not just the limited period during which the racetrack pur1 chase conspiracy occurred . KERNER 'S emotional performance was topped minutes later by the 73-year-old jurist who was sent in from Knoxville by Warren Burger , Chief Justice of the United States , to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father had been governor of Tennessee and was well aware of the drain put on a governor by the demends of citizens he seeks to serve . Taylor called Kerner to the bench and asked , " Do you have anything else to say ? " Kerner said he did not , that he had said all he wanted to say , and that he had given truthful answers to all questions during the trial . JUDGE TAYLOR told Judge Kerner that in sentencing him he faced the most difficult task in his 23 years on the bench . " You have suffered tremendously during this trial . You have been subjected to a searching investigation by federal agents . I know that those days you spent awaiting the verdict must have been the most heart-rending event that has occurred to you . " But as you , ' yourself , pointed out during the trial , you recognize that as a lawyer and ; a judge I have a duty to perform and I must say it is the most difficult that I have ever been faced with ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a voice barely audible began reading Defendant Kerner 's sentence . " You will be confined to a fed- j eral prison for a period of three years . . . . " OLIVER P. Stufflebeam could only laugh . A few chuckles , after all , could hardly put his neck in a burocratic noose . Stufflebeam is the IRS agent who labored for three years to dredge up the evidence needed to convict Otto Kerner . But yesterday Stufflebeam , his labors ultimately rewarded when a jail sentence was levied against the convicted Kerner , could only laugh . When Kerner was convicted , Stufflebeam reportedly talked about his work on the case to a few buddies in a North Side saloon . He was overheard by a reporter , who wrote a story about it . The next thing Stufflebeam knew , he was transferred from his investigative tasks to a desk job . " How does it make you feel  --  the sentence and all ? " he was asked . " Oh . . . well , ha , ha , ha . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be talking , but Oliver Stufflebeam was laughing about something .
