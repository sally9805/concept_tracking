By 1980 , Americans will use an estimated 560 billion gallons of water a day-more than twice the rate in 1960 . This means that more and more U.S. water must be clean enough to use repeatedly . Pollution , though , is overwhelming the ability of many rivers and lakes to purify themselves . Is the Government doing enough to restore the balance ? <P> Last week Ralph Nader offered a gloomy answer : a 700-page report entitled Water Wasteland , the product of a 21-month study by one of Nader 's numerous teams of " raiders . " Despite 15 years of effort , seven laws and more than $3 billion in expenditures , say the researchers , the federal program to curb water pollution is " a miserable failure . " <P> Laggard States . The main problem , asserts the Nader group , is the federal program 's failure to control industrial effluents . They account for at least 50% of the oxygen-consuming wastes handled by municipal water-treatment plants , many of which are thus overloaded . They also include very dangerous contaminants ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants can remove from drinking water . Even advanced plants , says the report , may be unable to handle the estimated 500 new chemicals that industry develops each year . <P> As for manufacturers ' ever-rising expenditures on air-and water-pollution controls , the researchers found that in 1969 this amounted to less than .2% ( $1.3 billion ) of annual revenues ( $694.6 billion ) . Moreover , " much of the $800 million spent in 1969 was for devices to purify incoming water so it could be used in manufacturing , not to clean the waste water going out . " <P> Ever since Congress enacted major water-quality laws in 1956 , the Government has left enforcement largely to the states . Under severe pressure from local industries , the states often set low standards ; right now , 22 states still do not have their standards fully approved by federal regulators . In addition , Washington has tried to talk offenders into compliance , a process that usually drags on for years . Meantime , the list of gravely contaminated waterways grows . Among the worst : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Escambia , Passaic , Merrimack , Rouge and Ohio . <P> New Jobs . Nader 's group is not optimistic about the effectiveness of either President Nixon 's or Senator Edmund Muskie 's water-quality bills now before Congress . Though both improve present laws , they are riddled with loopholes . To close them , the researchers propose several amendments . Example : federal pollution-control officers should be made to investigate all offenses and issue abatement orders immediately-or themselves face penalties . <P> The Nader report bristles with characteristic impatience . It scoffs at the old argument that the U.S. economy will suffer because pollution control will put marginal industries out of business . A big cleanup , it says , would probably create more jobs than it would destroy " because there is more work to be done . " That remains debatable .
