 | The Surprising Seventies Why the young will soon find themselves concerned with issues that they may not expect @# A GREAT many people take it for granted that today 's " youth culture " is the wave of the future . They assume that as the present generation of college students become the young adults of tomorrow , their new life-styles will come to dominate American society and our economy . Practically all of the popular forecasters have been telling us that this will mean a dwindling concern with affluence and the production of material goods . Maybe so . But the only facts that we know for sure about the future make these predictions look quite unreliable . It seems far more probable to me that during the ' 70s this country will return to a preoccupation with the traditional economic worries . Over the next decade , economic performance ? with jobs , savings and profits at the center ? may well become more important than it was in the ' 60s . What we know with certainty about America 's near future are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the United States had a baby boom after World War II . But few people realize how violent and unprecedented  | it was . Within a few years , mainly between 1945 and 1953 , the number of babies born in this country per year rose by almost 50 percent . If the baby boom was startling , so was the baby bust ten years later . For the six years following 1953 the number of births increased , but at a much slower rate . By 196o the total number of births had started to drop ? and kept on dropping for seven years . ( Today the birthrate is bumping along at about the same low level as that of 1967 , and shows little sign of going up . ) From these figures , we can foresee America 's size , structure and dynamics , because everyone who will enter college or the work force between now and the late ' 80s already is alive . We know , for example , that this year is the last year , for as long as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of gravity of our population. * In 196o , the center of population gravity in this country was in the 35-to-4o age group ? substantially older than usual . But between 1964 and 1971 the 17-year-old group increased , particularly during the past five years . As a result , the population center shifted all the way down to age 17 ? younger than it had been for several decades . The psychological impact of this shift proved unusually strong because so many members of the 16- and 17-year-old groups ? more than half of the young men ? did not join the work force but stayed on in school , outside adult society and without adult responsibilities . The youth revolution was therefore predictable ten or twelve years ago . It was , in fact , predicted by whoever took the trouble to look at population figures . But from now on , the center of population gravity will shift steadily upward , and by 1975 the dominant age years will be the early 20S . In urban and developed economies such as ours , the four years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap . No period in a man 's life ? except perhaps the jump from full-time work at age 64 to complete retirement at 65 ? involves greater social or psychological changes . Seventeen-year-olds are traditionally rebellious , in search of a new identity , addicted to causes and intoxicated with ideas . But young adults from 21 to 35 ? and especially young adult women ? tend to be the most conventional group in the population , the one most concerned with concrete and immediate problems . This is the age in which concern with job , advancement , mortgage , career , income , furniture and doctors ' bills moves to the fore . And this is the age group which , for the next 15 years , is going to dominate American society increasingly and to constitute its center of gravity . This group is even more likely than comparable age groups in the past to concern itself with the pro- saic details of materialism . For the shift between the economic reality they knew when they dominated our population as 17-year-olds , and the economic reality they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they become young marrieds , is going to be unusually jarring . In earlier generations , most 17-year-olds went to work , began to think about money , jobs , prices and budgets . The affluent 17-year-olds of the past ten years ? especially the very large proportion that went to college ? have never known anything but what the economists call " discretionary income . " They may not have had a great deal of money in their jeans , but however much it was they could spend it any way they wanted without worrying about the consequences . The necessities ? shoes , the dentist , food and , in most cases , tuition ? were still being provided by their parents . Now , within a few short years , they will suddenly have to take care of these things themselves . In brief , the graduates from today 's youth culture are likely to find themselves far more worried about jobs and money than they now suspect . The shock that the individual college graduate will feel on entering the job market may be severe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even stronger . During each year of the next decade , we will have to find jobs for 70 percent more college graduates than in each of the past ten years . The babies of the baby boom arc only now catering the work force in large numbers , and the full impact they will make is still three or four years away . The first implication of this is , of course , that jobs are likely to be of increasing concern to the young during the next ten years . The shift from " abundant jobs for college graduates " in 1969 to a current scarcity of jobs is not , as most commentators believe , merely a result of the 1970-1971 mini-recession . It is also a result of the overabundance of college graduates , which will continue until the end of the decade , even if the economy starts expanding again at a fast clip . At the same time that many more young , college-trained people are looking for jobs , the largest single source of jobs available to them in the ' 60s ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because the number of children in school during the past two decades expanded at an unprecedented rate , and most of the five million college graduates who received education degrees during this period went into teaching positions . During the next ten years , however , no more than two million teaching jobs will open up ; some forecasts put the figure closer to one million , One reason is that the school-age population will be smaller . Another is that teachers today are the youngest group of workers in the country ; so , ( ewer vacancies will occur because of cleat h and retirement . This decreasing tic mand for teachers will be only part Iv  | offset by an increasing demand for computer programmers , medical technologists and employes of local governments . If we hope to succeed in creating new jobs for young people during the years just ahead , the country will have to find a great deal of new capital somewhere . This is particularly true of the jobs we will need the most ? jobs for highly educated people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The greater the skill or knowledge demanded by a job , the greater the capital investment needed to make it possible . For example , a computer operator ca n't work without a computer . A doctor ca n't function efficiently without a substantial investment in a nearby hospital , equipped with everything from X rays to artificial heart-lung machines ? not to mention the costly equipment in his own office and in the laboratories on which he depends . A business executive 's job depends on a going business , his own or a corporation 's , and anyone who has ever tried to start even a small enterprise knows how much capital that eats up . We can not hope to get this new capital by drawing on fat in the economy ? by " reducing excess profits , " as youthful rhetoric sometimes bids us to do . New capital can come from only two sources : savings and profit . The government can in a number of ways to encourage ? or discourage ? savings and pr it ; but it can not create capital rectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can m the demand for new capital fort tion . The situation suggests possibilities for the most sustained boom in our history , however . It may al produce one of the most severe u employment crises . I do not assert that populati dynamics will determine the psychology , politics or even economy of the years to come . No one fact is decisive . But it seems equally surd to omit population as an important factor in determining t characteristics of any era , especia of a time marked by swings as extreme as those we are going throu now . The new big issues that ha emerged these past 20 years ? r and civil rights , the urban crisis , t environment ? will not go awa For this reason alone , the ' 70S W surely not be at all like the ' 50% the ' 30s . But a study of populati dynamics indicates that they will not be like the ' 60s either . Whether the ' dos will be con - vative or liberal , reactionary or r olutionary , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a in their economic concerns , the ' may be a very traditional ? indeed a quite old-fashioned ? decade . **30;795;TOOLONG @#
