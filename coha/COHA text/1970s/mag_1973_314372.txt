&gt; The speaker , Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev : " We believe that a new system of international relations can and must be built by honest and consistent observance of the principles of sovereignty and noninterference in internal affairs , and by unswerving implementation of signed treaties and agreements without playing games or engaging in ambiguous maneuvers . " <P> &gt; The public letter writer , Soviet Physicist Andrei Sakharov : " There are tens of thousands of citizens in the Soviet Union ... who want to leave the country and who have been seeking to exercise that right for years and for decades at the cost of endless difficulty and humiliation . You know that prisons , labor camps and mental hospitals are full of people who have sought to exercise this legitimate right . I am appealing to the Congress of the United States to give its support to the Jackson amendment . " <P> Two conflicting views from the Soviet Union , both aimed at influencing an act of the U.S. Congress . A gross interference in U.S. politics ? Not really , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nixon Administration 's Trade Reform Act of 1973 . That section of the bill would grant the Soviet Union so-called most-favored-nation status as a trading partner , entitling it to lower tariffs . The amendment to which Sakharov refers , as does Brezhnev indirectly , was first introduced nearly a year ago by Democratic Senator Henry Jackson . It would prevent Nixon from placing the Soviet Union on the list of favored nations unless the Soviet government lifts its restrictions against its citizens who wish to leave , who most notably are Jews who want to live in Israel . <P> Varied Motives . There is merit to the Brezhnev complaint that the Jackson amendment amounts to interference in the Soviet Union 's internal affairs . <P> Certainly any Soviet demand concerning the way in which the U.S. treats its own citizens would be furiously resented here . The legislation 's many supporters do not see it that way . It is so popular , in fact , that it has acquired one of the longest lists of cosponsors in congressional history : 77 Senators and 287 Representatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will pass . <P> A first test could come this week as the House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to complete closed-door hearings on the subject and vote . <P> The motives for the widespread support of the amendment are varied , and all have been overshadowed by an issue not directly involved in the legislation : <P> the new signs of a Soviet crackdown on political dissidents . The Jackson amendment restricts itself to the issue of emigration . Yet the untimely Soviet action against its dissidents has rallied support for the amendment , whose backers range the political spectrum from Democrats Edward Kennedy and George McGovern to Republicans Barry Goldwater and John Tower .
