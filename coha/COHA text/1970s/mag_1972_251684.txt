THE peace talks had reached a dead-end impasse . The original agreements , in effect , were being torn up , and negotiations had to begin anew . South Viet Nam 's President Nguyen Van Thieu was about to blow up any agreement he did not like anyway . So went the ominous reports last week as another lull in the battle for peace inspired nervous speculation . In fact , the situation was not at all that sour . There were sound reasons for cautious optimism as the secret talks were to resume this week and Henry Kissinger resumed his commuting to Paris . In tribute to his tireless comings and goings , some South Vietnamese peasants now describe him as " the king who travels at night . " <P> Thieu remained a prickly obstacle , as he feared , perhaps with some justification , that the nine-point plan worked out by White House Adviser Henry Kissinger and Hanoi 's Le Due Tho might seriously undermine his chance to survive . Thieu 's personal envoy , Nguyen Phu Due , was received twice by President Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed and very frank " - meaning there was sharp disagreement . While Nixon conceded that the proposed agreement was a compromise that could not fully satisfy Saigon , he also emphasized that it gave the Thieu government a fair chance to hold out against the Communists , both militarily and politically . Nixon and Kissinger termed the plan reasonable and urged Thieu , through Duc , to accept it . <P> The White House still expects Thieu , after a good deal of agony and political posturing , to do just that . Nixon refused to hold a summit conference with Thieu before the agreement with Hanoi was further pinned down , since that would , paradoxically , make Thieu look as though he were either a U.S. puppet or was pushing Nixon into a tougher bargaining stance . Washington feels that the momentum of negotiations and worldwide hopes for an end to the bloodshed is too strong for Thieu to resist . But Nixon also made it clear that the U.S. would not be blocked from a settlement that it considered prudent and workable by any intransigence on Thieu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a final gesture of cooperation in which both would approve a settlement after the outline is firmed up in Paris . <P> Knotty . The single most troublesome difficulty still was what would be required in the way of Communist troop withdrawals from South Viet Nam . The Kissinger-Tho agreement , revealed shortly before the U.S. elections , did not require Hanoi to remove any of its troops . Yet there apparently was a tacit understanding that some would go , although it would not be detailed in writing . This would preserve the Hanoi fiction that there are no North Vietnamese troops there . Thieu insists that all such troops must be removed and that this be guaranteed in print . Kissinger in Paris this week undoubtedly will be pressing for some compromise formula , presumably one that would make the unwritten understanding more explicit . A knotty related problem is whether Thieu will be required to release all political prisoners now held in South Viet Nam . It was revealed that another key question had been resolved in the earlier secret talks : the DMZ would be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
