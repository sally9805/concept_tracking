A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN by EUGENE O'NEILL <P> Broadway is a noble word again . Power , beauty , passion and truth command the stage of the Morosco Theater where A Moon for the Misbegotten has been revived in unmitigated triumph . We owe it all to the sensitive direction of Jose Quintero , the matchless performances of Jason Robards , Colleen Dewhurst and Ed Flanders and the piercing vision of Eugene O'Neill , who could laugh over humanity 's impish follies and grieve over the sad agony of man 's fate . <P> Josie Hogan ( Dewhurst ) calls herself " a great cow " and keeps house for her widowed father . She passes herself off as a slut , fearing that no man could desire her . She is actually the shyest of virgins . James Tyrone Jr . ( Robards ) , modeled on O'Neill 's elder brother , sees through her sham and is strangely drawn to her inner sweetness and innocence . He is a part-time actor corroded by drink , whoring and self-loathing . <P> Josie 's father Phil ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut pig farmer with a tongue that spits black Irish bile at his Yankee neighbors . Phil is Tyrone 's tenant , and he mistakenly fears that the scapegrace James intends to sell the farm . He baits a sex trap . Josie and James will be found in bed together . James will do the right thing and marry her . She will inherit the farm . <P> What actually occurs is a confessional by moonlight . Each is lulled to a deep tenderness . She confesses her secret , her virginity ; he reveals that he had no intention of selling the land . Then , in a great , stormy , self-lacerating monologue , James explains why he is so hateful to himself . He had accompanied his mother 's coffin on a tram from the West Coast to the East . Even drink could not blot out the pain of her death . <P> In a desperate degrading of her memory , James had made love to a fat tart " with the face of a baby doll " night after night in the private compartment next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey , he was too drunk even to attend her funeral . As Josie realizes , the only thing James wants from her is the temporary peace of absolution . She cradles him like a lost child , knowing that death alone can absolve him . <P> O'Neill wrote this play as a form of absolution for his brother . As with Long Day 's Journey into Night , it was another attempt " to make peace with my dead , " to lift the curse of the O'Neill family through the transfiguring insight and purgation of drama . Quintero has beautifully orchestrated the themes of sin , remorse , guilt , self-damnation and death that haunted the profoundly per/ turbed spirit of O'Neill . <P> Over the years , Jason Robards ' psychic affinity for O'Neill has marked the peaks of his acting career . His Hickey in The Iceman Cometh , Jamie in Long Day 's Journey , and title role in Hughie will probably never be surpassed . Increasingly , Robards even looks like O'Neill . He has the brooding , deep-set eyes that look out from O'Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain a touchstone for all actors to measure themselves by . <P>
