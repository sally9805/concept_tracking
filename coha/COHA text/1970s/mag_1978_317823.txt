by Nikolai Gogol <P> Adapted by Barbara Field <P> Nikolai Gogol had a mind like a trap door . Anyone venturing on the deceptive surfaces of his works must be prepared to lose his footing at unexpected moments and be sent plummeting into radical alterations of consciousness . Realism shifts to fantasy ; the prosaic turns mystical ; solid citizens stumble unwittingly into topsy-turvy land . <P> Onstage , Gogol 's characters look naturalistic enough , even transparently accessible , but it is the unseen company they keep-God , the devil and Russia-that lends them the strange dimensions of figures in fables . At one point in Marriage , a key character breaks into a paroxysm of laughter about the absurdity of just about everything . Then his face takes on an ashen look of desolation , and he says , " God have mercy on our sinning souls . " Gogol uses such juxtapositions to go beyond tragedy or comedy into a realm that might be called cosmic farce . <P> That specific tone is admirably captured in a luminous and hilarious revival of the seldom done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion the Guthrie imported Russian Director Anatoli Efros to stage the play , and his work is a marvel . Communicating through interpreters , he seems to have established an intuitive rapport with the cast . The actors get under the skin of an alien culture and , with seamless ensemble work , translate Russian characters and responses in supple body English . <P> Gogol produced the play in 1842 , and the plot has been a staple in many lands : the comic trials and tribulations of marriage brokers and their clients . Fiokla ( Barbara Bryne ) is an accomplished matchmaker , but she has something of a problem bride-to-be in Agafya ( Cara Duff-MacCormick ) . Agafya is a mer chant 's daughter and a bit of a ninny . The three suitors Fiokla lines up are chauvinist piglets . Ivan Pavlovich Poach'tegg ( Jon Cranney ) is a blustery , pompous bureaucrat . Poach'tegg ( sometimes translated Omelet ) is only after Agafya 's property , a two-story brick house , the walls of which he thumps to test their soundness .

Then there is a snob of an ex-infantry officer , Anuchkin ( Jake Dengel ) , who , though devoid of social graces himself , insists that any bride of his must speak French . <P> The yeasty comic genius of the play rests with a totally reluctant fourth suitor , a court councilor named Podkoliosin ( Peter Michael Goetz ) . Russian inertia runs like psychic sludge through Podkoliosin 's veins . He is a precursor of Goncharov 's famed character Oblomov , who could barely make the effort to get out of bed . When it comes to marriage , Podkoliosin can scarcely contemplate getting into bed . But he is sponsored and goaded by his friend Kochkariev ( Alvin Epstein ) , a born busybody . Epstein , in his first season as artistic director of the Guthrie , animatedly embodies the temperament of a man who can always double his energies as long as he is managing someone else 's affairs . Finally , Goetz 's Podkoliosin , the soul of skittishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate bid for freedom , he jumps perilously out of the second-story window of the marriage site .
