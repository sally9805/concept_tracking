: Strange developments ! " Magic is afoot in these woods , " in the words of Alkman . I must begin at the beginning . It was dusk . The first stars were beginning to appear above Mount Parnon and the wind was turning bitter cold when , pausingin the little song with which I was warming the cockles of my heart and entertaining my fellow prisoners for a mile or so on either side , I heard my jailer coming down the row of cells to the right of mine , feet crunching in the crusted snow , dragging a plank . He appeared at my door and glared at me , his bearded lips pursed to a kind of pout , steam blowing from his nostrils . I put aside my melody , rubbed my freezing hands together , and tried to look apologetic  --  for I do understand his problem . My very existence , for him , is criticism . My paunch condemns his asceticism ; my timid , wholly irrelevant grins deny the ironchainedorder of his soul . He went on glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my crutch and rising from my table to welcome him . " Bless you ! Always alert , " I cried , " like a rabbit ! " His black eyes grew violent , and I corrected myself : " Like a bear . " I was too late . He spit , only vaguely in my direction , and set up the plank and turned away to get another . I spoke to him again when he returned with the second plank  --  " Any news of the wars ? "  --  but he ignored me . When he came with the last plank hep35paused and looked at me a moment , not yet dropping it into place , and I believed he was struggling against a temptation to speak . For a man of stone , he was in agony  --  a brute straining toward thought . I said nothing , of course . There are times when even humor is out of place . His mouth worked , his underjaw twitched , and for an instant I had hopes that his eyes would cross the way Peeker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , instead , and I was disappointed . What was it he wanted to say to me ? Some word of animalistic rage ? Some news of how horribly Fin to die ? Strange to say , I think not . His iracund , musclehoundface was like a child 's  --  it made me remember my own poor son Kleon , back in Athens . Without thinking , I stretched out my hand to him , and suddenly , with animal fury , he slammed the plank into position , shutting me in . He left then . I caught only a glimpse of his legs cutting the dusk like huge , slow stones , a statue walking . So much for the evening 's beginning . It was an omen , clear as an eagle carrying flowers above your left shoulder . Darkness settled . I fed my rats the portion of our supper Pecker and I had saved for them , and after that , feeling in no mood for art or talk with Peeker , I took my constitutional , walkingaround and around my table , deepening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth of my floor . Every few rounds I would pause at the cell door to look out , watching for revolutionists ' fires , listening for the outbreak of a riot or the noise of an execution . There was nothing . It did not calm me . Quiet nights are the worst . You keep waiting , wondering which direction the trouble is going to strike from . ( I can seldom foresee any troubles that involve me directly . That 's how it always is , people say . Tieresias . Kassandra . ) Somewhere near midnight , as near as I can tell , I was startled by a hint of movement outside the bars but inside the lean-to of planks . I stopped , trembling like a leaf , clutching my heart . ( Even as a younger man , I was never up to this kind of thing . ) Peeker 's eyes were open , bright as an owl 's . Nothing stirred . For a long time I waited , trying to see past the glow of the lamp on the table between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew.  |p36A  wolf , some young Spartan here to murder me  --  I could not guess . Then there was another movement and something fluttered to the floor inside the bars . A minute later a dark , bony hand came through the bars and the index finger pointed at the scrap of thin parchment . Some trick by my jailer ! I thought . Is it possible ? Sucking my cheeks in , slow and wary , I moved closer to the scrap and , four feet from where it lay , I reached out with my crutch to drag it toward me . The rats in the corner watched , torn between snatching the note for dessert and keeping clear of the creature behind the bars . I stooped then , keeping my eyes on the dark doorway , picked up the parchment and glanced at it in haste . My glance caught and stuck . All the unreasonable pleasure in life I thought I had abandoned years ago churned up in my chest as if to drown me , and I reached out to steady myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I whispered , " Wait ! " He stayed . The message was from a woman  --  a girl  --  what should I say of a sixty-year-old child ? The note was from my beloved Iona . I was in no condition to read it just then , but I would know that furious , childish scrawl if I found it carved on the moon . I taught her how to write , I 'm ashamed to admit . I am ordinarily an excellent teacher , and Iona was a brilliant student ; but Iona learns what she chooses to learn , especially from me . I stared at the writing without reading it as I used to sometimes stare at her mouth , not listening to her words . It came to me then that the light from my lamp made the messenger vulnerable : the jailer , if he were to look from the side , would see the shape crouched under the planks and would sooner or later realize it was somewhattoo large for a frog . I turned and blew out the lamp , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , stroking my beard . It was a boy I had seen before  --  no more than nineteen , I would guess . It 's hard to tell a Helot 's age , especially of late . The war 's been hardest on the Helots . Malnutrition stunts them in their youth , labor and flight make them old before their time . He had slanted eyes , like Iona 's , and a face too much like a skull . His eyes flicked continually from side to side , the eyes of a boy who 's spent most of his life on darkp37unpeopled streets or sprinting up lightless alleys in the city of his enemies . " Iona 's all right , young fellow ? " I asked . He nodded . It meant nothing . They always nod , eyes flickeringaway . " She 's not sick ? She has n't got the piles ? Her stools are nor-mal ? " " No , not sick . " I had to read his lips . " Not in prison , either ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of Sparta , then , as I 've always so wisely advised her ? " " No . " This time he spoke aloud . I raised my hands to hush him . " Tell her she must , " I said . " Tell her if she does n't , the consequenceswill be dire . " He smiled and , seeing his smile , I knew him . Her grandson . So she 'd brought him into it too . She was crazy . " Young man , " I said , " your grandmother is crazy . " I began pacing hastily back and forth in front of him . " We must try to help her , poor thing . I know how you must suffer , seeing her wander about like a Iamb some horse has kicked , hearing her babble her curious language  --  but we must be patient and kindly and do what little we can to give her comfort . Could you tie her up in the cellar , perhaps wall her up someplace , with a hole to pass in food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from you . " I straightened up , indignant . " Nonsense ! All I offer is mild and harmless confusion . " Then : " You must force her to do as I say , get clear of Sparta . " I spoke earnestly now , on the chance that he was an innocent . " Do it for my sake . " " No , " he said very simply , stubborn as a mule . " The revolution is on . " I sighed . " You 've caught it , then  --  her craziness . Why could n't she have had mere measles , say , or the seaport plague ? " I re ignored me . ( Everybody ignores me . ) " I 'll be back , " he said , " if I can . "  |p38I  nodded . " No doubt . The cell next door is empty . They killed the fellow . " But he was gone . He went across the snow and into the trees without a sound . After his visit I could n't sleep , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or for her , or for myself . But in the morning rats had nibbled my fingers as usual , so I 'd slept after all . There 's a lesson in that . All human feeling is a slight exaggeration.  |p39Agathon  : When he got up this morning , Peeker would n't speak to me . He resents his lack of divine omniscience . A healthy condition in uung people . He pointedly ignored Iona 's note , which I 'd left on the table , and when the jailer came and I greeted him like an old friend , Peeker turned away and folded his arms and stared with intense unconcern at the back wall . I ate . He stubbornly eschewed the table . I understood his point of view , and in my youth I might have sympathized . But now that I am old and cachexic , I need my nourishment . When I 'd finished my food I arc his . He remained intractable . Toward noon I said , " Peeker , it is my duty to tell you a story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That too was excellent , from my point of view . I am determined to make him a Seer . " Sit down , " I said kindly , persuasively . He sat . I dragged my chair from the table to the cell door , where I could sit with my back to the glare of the snow , andwhen I had made myself comfortable , I spoke to him as follows . " Pecker , my boy , as you 've observed yourself , I am much , much too old to be in love . It 's undignified . Also , it 's against my plilosophy , I think . Nevertheless , you see before you a lover . Dignity , and philosophy are for mountains . " Pecker laughed more violently than before . I waited for him to finish ( gasping , clutching his head between his knees , and stompin ! ! up and down ) , then resumed . " I met her many years ago , when my wife was still here withp40me in Sparta and I was still on excellent terms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was satisfied with snarling obscenities at him , or laughing till I wept at his high-toned pronouncements . " I was , I must explain , an attractive and witty young man . This furfuraceous , fucoid mop that now shatters from my brow and spatters obscenely at the world from my chin was an august brown ; my eye was aurora-borealic ; my every speech was delicatelyperfumed . I had not yet succumbed to the fluxion of the world . " He was groaning , trying to crawl under the bed . I decided to alter my style . " What I meant to speak of , Pecker , was Iona  --  the lady who sent the epistle last night . I mean to lay bare my sufferings and sorrows . " His feet stopped struggling , and after a moment he backed out from under the bed . He studied me , to see if it was a trick , and then , with a hopeless sigh , sat down on the bedside as before . " Fat hell , " he said without spirit . Even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were two red holes . I nodded and told him the tale . She was a Helot  --  that is , a captive . Originally the word meant , I suspect , a captive from Helos . Such matters are always obscure in Sparta . Spartans are not , as they express it , hoarders of knowledge . In the beginning , people say , the Helots were slaves to particularmasters ; but Sparta 's communism did away with that . Now they are simply the property of Sparta , not exactly slaves but not Spartans either , more like the cows and goats they herd or the fields they till . They do all the work . ( Spartans are warriors , Lykourgos says , not drones . ) The Spartans have nothing to do with the Helots except , now and then , to hunt one down and cut him to pieces , or hang him for smiling at a Spartan girl , or put him on display and laugh at his dancing or the foolish way he talks .  --  They do , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms I believe to be older than those of the Spartan dialect . Once you have stupidly fallen in love with a Helot woman , their language becomes as beautiful as the music theyp41play  --  not the clean harsh flutes of the Spartans ( nor the rich , sophisticated music that comes from the Athenian harp ) but gentle , Phrygian lyres that , crude as they are , move even a sensibleman to tears . The Spartans scorn such music , of course . I may say in its defense that it conjures a world , an impossible world , admittedly  --  the innocence of Athenian childhood , the summer calm of a just state at peace . It 's healthy for a man to be reminded of such things , however they may mock him . ( More healthy for a free man , of course , than for a Helot . ) I stood with Lykourgosonce at an execution in the square , and as I watched , full of rage at Lykourgos 's foul laws and howling in secret at the needless brutality of the legal murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bars , some Helot 's lyre behind me , far down the street . The sound was so distant I was only half sure it was not my imagination . In any case , I heard it , and suddenlyall my anger gave way to grief and despair and searing love for some unreachable ideal . Tears filled my eyes and I nudged Lykourgos with my elbow . " Listen to the lyre , old horse , " I said . He watched the execution . " The music of weaklings , " he said . They never go near the Helot huts , except for more labor at harvesttime or else for theft or murder . ( You seldom see it happen . You come upon a bright-red stain on a stone path , or an early-morning cluster of workers bending over something in a hayfield . ) But my wife and I walked where we pleased in Sparta , and , because I was of use to him , or because he coveted my book , Lykourgos let it pass . We had far more in common with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than we had with our Spartan hosts . This was while I was still a guest , an " adviser , " honored though despised . We began to visit certain huts fairly often , usually for some festival  --  a funeral , a wedding , one of the innumerablegame days or days of sacrifice Lakonia honors . The talk was a relief after all Lykourgos 's damned aphorisms . The Helots have no more education than the Spartans , but the Helots at least are n't ignorant by choice . They have among them men who can recite nearly all of Homer , and not just for the supposedmorality . They have excellent , uninhibited singers . They have women among them  --  Iona was one  --  who can cook as wellp42as an Athenian . They have dancers and lyrists and , best of all ( or so I thought as a callow youth ) , people more eager to play with ideas than to eat . Among these last , the best of the lot was Dorkis , Iona 's husband . We met him at his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Helot friends  --  or so I imagine , knowing her  --  and , being a lady who would not be outdone , she sent a messenger to invite us to join her family and a few close friends for some pious festival  --  I 've forgotten which . I was , at least from a Helot point of view , a person of importance : an Athenian , heir to the old Mykenaian and Ionian civilizations , no Spartan savage come down from the Dorian mountains . I was , moreover , the personal guest of Lykourgos , living in his palace , at times his unofficial diplomaticenvoy to Thuria or Antheia , even Messene . What power she must have thought she had within her grasp ! She had even then the fires of revolution in her , though she was n't yet aware of it . She would show me what culture the Helots maintained in semisecret , would ravish me with food and flowers and music and her clever husband 's talk . I would become her ally , her ornament , and she would become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the Spartans would have laughed ! Goats might sooner pretend to civilized manners ! And I , too , laughed , to tell the truth . I was a cocky fool . We went . It was one of the better huts . One might in fact call it a fine house . It was large , anyway , by Helot standards , and newly limed , which made it a fair parody of Lykourgos 's place . We passed through the courtyard and stood in the doorway , my wife and I , looking in at the round room with its hearth in the center , and we were simultaneously dazzled and amused . There were huge wall paintings , all on arcane religious subjects and done in the most ungodly Oriental style . Bright drapes and beads hung everywhere , charging the room like a harvest of biffins and snow apples ; the furniture  --  leviathan painted tables and carved chairs like behemoths at rest  --  burlesqued Athenian elegance ; and wherever there was space there were fresh fruit and flower arrangements with figurines set in their leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , were Iona 's work . She had a kind of genius along that line . It was all , that night , like somep43magical cave from the dream of a savage  --  light , shadow , color , incessant movement . But the crowning achievements were Dorkis and Iona herself . He was dressed like some apterous mythological bird , in azure and gold and burnished black and scarlet , with barbaric golden earrings like those of Sardis , and though it should all have been lewd , bumptious , he brought it off : his smile and eyes were brighter than his garb . He was no man of Helos , one knew at once by the slant of his eyes , but an Easterner . ( He claimed mixed Ionian and Asian descent ; his father had been an omen watcher on the island of Hydrea . ) His wife , still axis of all that aureate churning and flash , wore a white chiton , unembroidered , pinned at the hip and shoulder by black two-headed serpents made of iron . Her breasts were like cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exposed to the very halo of the nipple . No naked Spartan girl could have dreamed of competing . I gave her a hasty , embarrassed salutation  --  I was no voyeur , a dedicated amorist  --  and turned my attention to Dorkis . With a smile like sheet lightning , at once ironic and benevolent , she took my wife 's arm , and I watched them go , my wife ( dressed in black ) like Pallas Athena and Iona like  --  well , a bacchante who 'd bear watching . " Ah , Agathon ! " her husband said , and we embraced in the Helot style . ( He was several drinks ahead of me  --  as were they all . But he would n't hold his advantage long . He was used to Helot wine ; I was n't . ) " I 've heard of you , " I said . " I 'm glad we 've finally met . You have a wonderful house . " I had , in fact , heard of him . Among the Helots he served as physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly , he was not , from everything I 'd heard , one of those crackpots who are forever pushing men back into the swamps  --  urging them to barbaric sacrifices in times of war , or stirring up the crowd to unusual cruelty , like that of the old days , in the whipping ceremony at the festival of Orthia . You have seen such men  --  wizards , witches , demagogues , not honest prophets : demon minds that feed on disaster . Dorkis was not one of those . To the Spartans , who knew nothing of his standing within his own culture , he was one of the most useful and responsible of servants ( technically , he had been ele/vated to the hollow status of " New Citizen , " something between a horse and a Spartan Inferior ) ; he was the man in charge of selecting and preparing the food for the communal eating halls . It was said that he 'd been , before the redistribution , a personal servant to the palace . His power was enormous , at least in potential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he chose to  --  though one knew the instant one met his eyes that whatever the Spartans might do to the Helots , Dorkis would not turn poisoner . But he had other powers too , as history would show . He had the Spartans ' trust . They could hardly believe any evil of him , even after it was proved . This not only because he was obviously brave and noble ( despite his curiously Oriental stance ) , but also because they gave him little advantages . Like masters everywhere , even Athens , they knew the art of corruptingthe elite among the people they dominated , and letting the elite take care of the rest . They forgot two things , in his case : his odd religiosity , which made him in fact incorruptible , and his wife . Dorkis had one further hook into power . As master of the communal eating halls , he knew all the important Helots  --  vineyard keepers , olive growers , goatherds , potters , wagon masters , the lot . Most of them owed him favors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him  --  and had speculated about him . When I praised his house , sweeping my arms toward the painted walls , he laughed and shrugged , boyishly modest . He 'd been an athlete once , a javelinist barred from the Olympics only by his station , and when he shrugged you saw that he still had the chest and shoulders for it . He said , " Oh , it 's nothing , nothing . " And then , quickly , extending a hand to one side and pivoting , he invited me to meet his guests . The house was crowded and noisy as the sea with party cachinnation , but I no longer remember clearly who was there . A man named Kebes , a vineyard keeper whom I 'd met before , the largest young man I have ever seen , close to seven feet tall and still as stone ; a woolly-bearded goatherd who 'd done well enough that nowadays he seldom sniffed a goat but who somehow nevertheless maintained a perpetual dudgeon ; a small , ironic , testy man whom I later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a son who was insane ; he became a famousp45arsonist and roof crawler in the later days of the revolution ) ; two or three Helot priests . There were always priests at Dorkis 's house . Religion , as I 've said , was one of his fascinations . Sex and wine , sad proofs of life 's caducity , were the others . There were various other people there , well-off Helots and their wives , an Athenian ex-patriot or two , a pet liberal Spartan , all milling , lounging , battening each other on wine and fanny patting . I talked through nearly the whole evening with Dorkis . Tuka , my wife , talked with everyone , as usual . She was radiant , casually elegant as a mountain temple , so conscious of her easy superiority of taste and class that she could lay them aside like a shawl . ij " These Spartan markets ! " she said , and staggered , face and body , 11 as if she 'd been hit on the side of the head by a timber . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an invisible load  --  " and all it buys you is three eggs and a cauliflower . But OK , at least it 's better going into the market than trying to get out . On the way in you 've got protection , but on the way out all these people have these armloads of iron they ca n't see over , and every time you turn around you get zonked . " She reeled , carrying the invisible cauliflowerand eggs , being zonked . " It 's so absurd , really . Why use money at all  --  as my husband tells Lykourgos . " ( I never did . ) " Why not let people just buy things with lies and promises ? It would keep everybody on his toes . " Everyone laughed . Iona said scornfully , laughing with the rest , " Clearly unfair ! Tuka would own the whole world in a week , and we 'd all have to move to Africa . " They laughed again , and Tuka launched a story . I turned back to the men . Dorkis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distillationthe Helots drink straight and the rest of the world mixes one-to-six with water . " To Lykourgos ! " he said , and grinned . He liked me , it was manifest ; and  --  who knows why ?  --  I was delighted . I knew from the first that I was doomed to show off for Dorkis as I would for some girl . " To psychotic coherence ! " I said . He and the priest beside him laughed . We drank . But Dorkis was thinking , impish . His eyes brightened and snapped into focus on distances , like an eagle 's . " That 's the trouble , " he said . " Coherence . "  |p46I  smiled . He liked me . Ah ! His eyes snapped over to me , then away again , and he tipped his head back , thinking out his phrases . It hit me that he too was showing off . I was honored . " There 's a sense in which everythinghas to balance , " he said . His right hand peeled away like a seagull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big clutter of truths , some of them conflicting but all of them true . Each truth is a kind of stern god . Turn your back on one  --  " His hands danced out , turned their backs . The priest beside him shook his head sadly , a little drunk . " We must not presume , " he said . He had a weak chin . Dorkis ignored him by nodding agreement , a favorite trick of his , I learned . He opened his arms with loving-kindness for the whole world . " Pursue one single truth , never glancing to left or right , and pow ! " Light sparkled from his eyes with the word , the boxer 's pow of his fist . He was glorious , bright as a thousand garnets . He could have said " Circles are square " and I would have been hurled to the highest reaches of philosophy . I drank and filled my cup . " There 's a sense in which nothing is true , " he said . " Triangles , for instance . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triangle on a round pot . The sum of the angles changes , or else the lines are n't straight . " He hunched his shoulders , more like a wrestler than like a potter , laughing with delight at the difficulty of life and pretending to struggle over lines on the side of his cup . " It 's simple , " I said . " You smash the pot and draw in the rubble . " He laughed . " To Lykourgos ! " We drank . " That 's the way it is , " he said . " Life . Experience . It 's like somethingalive , forever changing its shape . There 's a sense in which as soon as you learn its laws it 's become something else . It wreaks havoc on ethical theories . " I laughed , merely from good humor . If I wanted to be hypercritical , I might have observed that Dorkis was inclined to be sententious . " Everything 's air , " he said . " The breath of God . " With this phrase he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from the city calling his animals ; and I laughed.  |p47The  priest smiled and nodded to show he was awake . He looked puzzled , however . Dorkis said , " You have to ride it , like a bird . " " That 's so , " I said . I realized with pleasure that I was drunk on two cups , and the whole evening lay before me like a meadow . " Ethics , " I said , " is some theory a man imposes on the world . A man makes up a set of rules , or some fool priest makes up the rules  --  " I wagged my finger at the priest . " And you try to make the rules inside you fit what 's outside . If the world outside is nothing like what your rules say , or if it fits your rules on Tuesdaybut then on Wednesday it changes . . . " ( This was not my usual view , but I was pleased by it , and I 've held it ever since , for sentimental reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , but you 're both quite mistaken . " " Priests would be beggars if people were n't always mistaken , " Dorkis said . The cheerful talk went on through dinner , some splendid thoroughly unspartan meal I no longer remember except in isolatedimages : my wife , Tuka , gleaming , talking with fine wicked wit about Korinth ; some fat , dark lady who looked like a grackle bending her head to hear what the testy man said through the side of his mouth ; Iona holding up a wide clay black-figured dish as if doing a dance with the cluster of shadows on the white stone wall behind her . Dorkis and I shouted , telling stories with obscure points . His teeth and slanted eyes glinted , the muscles of his cheeks bunched up like fists , his hands flew wildly , now like a boxer 's , now like some delicate artisan 's . The drunker he got , the keener his mind became , it seemed to me . I grew duller , but I made up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat on the soft couch with his arm around Tuka , his hand on her breast . She talked lightly , cleverly about silversmiths , and Dorkis laughed till tears came , ravished by her brilliance  --  the quick , dingy wit , the lightning-fast plasticity of face , the clowning body . He clung to her tightly , head against her shoulder . I was a little surprised by all this , but it seemed not unnatural . I went outside . The trees went round and round like big black chariots.  |p48I  stood for some minutes sucking in the air , trying to get my mind clear , and then I walked out into the garden , momentarily convinced that I was interested in vegetables and flowers . I picked a leaf and held it up against the moon . Awe went through me like a pain , and then , for some reason , I lost interest . I urinated . When I returned to the back steps of the house Iona was leaning against a pillar as if with native and accidental grace . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help but notice . " She smiled . I was full of woe . " Come roll with me in the garden , " I said . I put my hand on the pillar she leaned on , and she smiled again , studying my face . " If I followed my inclinations  --  " she said . She remembered the cup in her hand and took a sip . I put my hand on hers and she looked down . For an instant my mind cleared . She was confused , less certain of the game than I had imagined  --  or was she acting ? She filled my mind with jungles . Birds and tigers . I was tempted to press her and perhaps I would have , but Tuka was standing in the low , square doorway , her skin white against the black of her hair and dress . She was smiling the slightly crooked smile she gets when she 's had too much to drink , and she was looking at us up-from-under like a bull . It struck me with terrific force that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . We went.  |p49Peeker  : Stories , stupidities  --  he never lets up ! The ephors came this morning , three of them , to collect our writing . I gave them nothing , though I wanted to . The old man 's talk about why they collect the stuff got to me . Agathon gave them a big messy pile of things  --  stupid damn drawings of dogs . I was afraid when they came  --  all those guards and people with banners and all those swords  --  but when they 'd stood there at the cell door a little while , talking with the jailer , asking whether we were eating and how we were sleeping nights , I began to feel less afraid . Agathon sat at the table serene as a mountain , smiling at them the way he 'd have smiled at a delegation of children , and when they spoke to him he would answer as if they 'd asked some other question , like a deaf man . Their spokesman  --  I did n't hear any of their names  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with so much power . His legs were hairless , like a young boy 's , and pale from his spending all his time indoors . He stood with his head thrown forward a little , like an important man being taken on a tour of a city 's defenses . He had a sharp mind , you could see at a glance , but what he might be thinking was as obscure as old astrologers ' charts . He glanced through Agathon 's drawings and did n't smile . When I saw they were about to turn away I said , " Sir ! " The spokesman turned back with his eyebrow lifted , impersonal and polite . " Son ? " he said . I was moved  --  all choked up  --  at his calling me son . A feeling went through me , like the shock from an eel ,  |p50that  I could trust him . Why would he be here visiting us if he did n't care that we got justice ? And the way he stood , perfectly erect , not slouching the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful and considerate bend of the head and shoulders , not a slouch but an invitation to us to think of him as a friend  --  it made me think of a ship 's captain or an iren guiding his troops . His mild eyes fixed me like pins . I said , " Sir , we 've been falsely accused . " My eyes filled with tears . It was like a plea , but I was n't ashamed . He put me at ease . " Oh ? " he said . He was waiting , and I said , " My master 's the loyalest man in all Sparta . He 's too proud to say so himself , sir , but it 's true . He 's a man of the deepest integrity , sir . That 's why people hate him .

People ca n't stand that  --  they say things in public and then there 's Agathon showing that all they say is wrong . That bothers people . " The ephor merely listened , far away as the mountains , the eagles that fly beyond the rims of the farthest mountains , but I could see he was taking it all in . He 'd weigh it , maybe begin an investigation . I glanced over at Agathon . He was looking at me with quizzical interest , as if I was talking about somebody he did n't know . The ephor was still waiting , looking me up and down with cool but not unfriendly detachment , the kind of thing you expect from a good administrator . The others stood a step behind him , one of them fat and kindly , soft-looking , rubbing his little hands together , eager to be my friend , the other ephor short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and then again might not . " Lykourgos knows about him , sir , " I said . " Agathon worked for Lykourgos for a long time . He was one of his top advisers . " " But Lykourgos is at Delphi , " the ephor said . He was honestlyp51concerned . He sucked in the corner of his lower lip , thinking about how he could get through to Lykourgos . " Well , " I said , " the kings know about Agathon too . " His eyebrows lowered a little . He was still looking at me hard , judging me carefully . " Do you think they 'd care ? " He was right , I knew . What was justice to them ? But I was excited . The ephor was a man who leveled with you . I 'd been right to trust him . Now I wished the shit I 'd written something to give them , some kind of point-by-point defense . That reminded me , and I said , " Sir , what 's the charge against us ? " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his look was still mild , but his mind was a thousand miles away , reconsidering our whole case . Then he looked past me , over my head , rememberingsomething . He worked it out , made some decision , then turned to the jailer . " See that they get everything they need , " he said . Without another word , he left , striding across the sloping field with the other two ephors hurrying behind him and the soldiers and men with banners running to catch up . Agathon smiled . " You played it brilliantly , " he said . I could have hit him with a chair , but I kept my temper . We had hope now . " You 're crazy , " I said . " I mean literally . " And it came to me that it was true . He was a great Seer , yes , and he was a good old man , but he was out of his mind , insane . I 'd been cowed by him before . I had n't realized that a genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two points ; but I knew now . I was n't playing , I was pleading with that ephor with all my heart . And if Agathon could n't see that , it had to be because he 'd spent so much time seeing through men 's lies he 'd forgotten what plain truth sounded like . I glanced at him to see if my guess about him was true . He was still smiling , and he 'd rolled the pupils of his eyes up out of sight . It scared me , that sudden realization of how crazy he really was . I was going to have to fight for us both  --  with no idea what it was I was fighting or who it was that was against us . There he sat , filthy and fat , lewd , with those horrible eye whites staring at me and cracks of dirt around his neck and sweat beads on his forehead and the tip of his nose . He was helpless , I could see it now , which meant not only that I had to do itp52all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to cry . But there was still that tall , cool ephor . There was hope . I decided to work the whole thing out in writing . That was what they 'd given us the parchment for  --  I could see that now . What are the most likely charges against Agathon ? 1 . Corrupting the youth , mainly because of his singing. 2 . Friendship with Helots ; hence , possible complicity in the revolution . ( Nonsense. ) 3 . Talking too much about the kings , etc. 4 . Public nuisance ( smelling of onions , breaking wind , etc. ) . 5 . Bad personal appearance. 6 . Molesting old women . I kept staring at the list . I could n't believe it . Surely there had to be more to it than that ! Surely they could see that all these were mere foibles or jokes ! When I glanced over at Agathon , he was looking at me as coolly , as rationally , as the ephor had , his interlaced fingers resting on his beard . The complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyre . He said , " I 'll tell you another thing about Lykourgos , my boy . He gets headaches . " I waited . " He 's had them all his life , " Agathon said . " He 's asked me about them once or twice , since I pretend to a smattering of medical knowledge . I suggested that he have himself poisoned : then all our headaches would end at once . " Agathon laughed wildly , then sobered . " He rarely smiles at my jokes . He merely stares at me , mournful , and sometimes shakes his head . I have a theory about his headaches , though . He gets them from clenching his teeth . I told him once : Lykourgos , that which is unnatural , Nature destroys . You 're a doomed man , " All life is doomed , finally , ' he said . " You see what I have to contend with.  |p53Agathon  : Peeker labors on . God bless him . As the soldiers labor on , dying for freedom ( both sides ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no news , either by normal or by extraordinary channels , on the plague . Last night , unluckily , my jailer did not put the planks up over my door , so that Iona 's boy could n't visit me , if he meant to , for lack of cover . I sat wrapped in blankets beside the door squinting out into the ghostly snowlight , hoping to catch some sign of life , some sign that he was at least there , waiting for his chance . The sticks on the hearth crackled pleasantly , but my mind was full of Iona , Tuka , my poor unlucky children , my childhood friend , poor Konon . I watched the stars , unnaturally bright and distinct , riddlesome , imperceptibly turning above me , counting my hours , and they mixed themselves up , somehow , with my thoughts of people . I scoff at astrologers and tease my jailer with the antics of those Great Pretenders , but I know I too am a kind of pretender in matters of Destiny . I clown , pretending to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque my own nature in an abaxial attempt to get it clear ; but I understand nothing , for all my fine reputation . I strut or rant or giggle or taunt reality with obscene little gestures , like some actor imploring tier on tier of silent observers to show some reaction  --  laugh , throw stones  --  but the stars remain aloof , expressionless , creating  --  perhaps even purposefully ( as an audience voluntarily gives the actor time )  --  the span of my existence . At times , squinting up , furtive , humblyp54amenable , I am filled with a superstitious fear that they know the plot , and possibly control it . Or that , in any case , someone , Something , knows the plot . How else can I explain these " impressions " that occasionally come to me  --  clear knowledge of distantthings , things still in the future , almost always things of no interest to me whatever ? No ; precision : I have an unreasonable intuition of deadly inevitability , both in myself and in the world . The skull behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times with my son Kleon . I would observe him at play , transforming the pebbles on a path into houses , ingeniouslyconstructing and peopling cities , or talking to imaginary friends under a roof of low-hanging branches behind the goat pen . In all he did there was a gentleness , an insistent faith in the goodness of things , that , turned on harsh actuality , would make him , inescapably , what he would be . When he was overtired , as a small boy , and things went wrong for him  --  some game interrupted by a command to go to bed , or his will frustrated by the recalcitrance of matter ( a stubborn pony , a pebble that obstinately refused to stay put on the wall he was building )  --  the gentleness would give way to an alarming rage , a childish yet terrible nihilism that filled me with fear . The change I would see in Kleon at such moments made his future seem to hang on blind chance : given the right set of accidents , he would grow up to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might become the worst . I fully credited this doctrine , the fortuity of time , but for all the certainty of my intellect , I would find myself struggling to penetratehis future ; anticipate and control it . The point is , I caught glimpses which seemed to deny  --  no , overwhelm  --  my doctrine : I felt moments of emotional certainty , however illogical or nonsensical , that I was onto something , that I was suddenly face to face with some potential more real than all the others  --  moments of heightened awareness , as it seemed , that cried out with all the fixed authority of a parent or a king or an oracle  --  sudden and final as an earth-splitting , river-building stamp of star-rimmed Pegasos ' hoof : This is it . So , too , with Iona . Throughout my long affair with her , I again and again experienced periods in which it seemed that whatever strange hold she had on me had relaxed a little ; I might eventuallyp55free myself of her cacodemonic influence . I would meet her with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same pleasure I 'd have felt on meeting Solon unexpectedly , or my father , or some fellow poet-sage . We 'd talk casually , brightly , Iona and I , and I would think , At last we can be friends . And then one day , at the height of my confidence , I would turn and catch her out of the corner of my eye , and she would smile and I would know I was trapped forever . She was my Great Bitch , my ambsace , my doom . If she had said , before Lykourgos and all the ephors , " Kiss me , Agathon , " I would have done it . And it 's a matter of fact that whenever she sent me out into the hills for thorns and stones and wild flowers for some room decoration , I dropped all my labors , poor miserable wretch , and went . ( I 'd sit baffled , marveling , as she wove bits and pieces of the world togetherinto charming , riotous wholes of blooming confusion , substance triumphant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say as she toyed with some black , shriveled olive leaf . She took it as a challenge . She 'd have used the Kolossos of Rhodes if I could have lugged it to her house . ) It would all have been simple if Tuka had n't had equal , if not greater , power . Between them , I was as helpless as a ship in a hurricane . I was never short on will  --  I am capable even of violent opposition to what I disfavor . But there were forces , both inside me and outside , that turned my will to jelly . It was sexual partly , of course . If I feel the itch of it even now , a sensibly impotent old Seer , no wonder if in my middle thirties I walked crouched over or hopped on one foot . They were the two most beautiful women I 'd ever encountered , and when I touched either one of them I was fiercely aroused , driven madder , in fact , than I 've ever been since by Apollo . ( An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at ladies fifty years my junior and wonder that any man alive is moderately sane . ) But it was more than that . They were , both of them , goddessesin the only sense of the word I understand . They were embodiments of heavenly ideals  --  conflicting ideals  --  that my soul could not shake free of . Tuka , even on those awful occasions when her mind came unhinged , had the precision of intellect , the awesome narrowness of purpose , of a mathematician or a general . She knew , beyond any shadow of a doubt , what she wanted fromp56life and why she wanted it , and she would stalk her desire with the single -- mindedness of a carpenter driving a nail . Iona wanted not some one thing but everything ; she had a mind as wide , as devious and turbulent , as a poet 's , and she went for what she desired like a swarm of blind bees in a windstorm . I danced with Tuka once , at one of the Helot festivals , and when the dance shifted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes like a Lystragonian 's , " Get out ! Do n't speak to me ! Get out ! " She was enraged , jealous of my dancing with my own wife , and when I begged her to be reasonable she snatched her veil from the back of a chair and quit the place . Dorkis , though he grinned , looked baffled and meek . She had always been too much for him , though they both pretended it was merely his respect for her independence . ( Perhaps it was . Perhaps I 'm too hasty . ) " You should go after her , " I told him . " It 's not safe , out on the streets at night . Suppose some young Spartan fools should come across her , out there alone . " He left at last , reluctantly , more afraid of perturbing Iona , I think  --  invading her privacy , he would have said  --  than of what any Spartan thug might do . I wanted to go after her myself . I could n't stand Iona 's rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held me , nailed me where I was like bat 's wings on a barn door . I understood again , that instant , the two women 's power over me , and I wondered , riding the current of their be- dazzling rage , what I was riding toward . I would not think about it . The future was blind chance , and I would wait it out . But whatever is deepest in a man told me I was lying . This was it . A glimpse of Destiny . I was sure of it . But this was what ? Many years later , after Dorkis 's execution , her power over me changed its form , though not its intensity . She accepted , rightly , her blame for his death , and accepted something else more strange , her mysterious identity , through me , with Tuka  --  alter ego , mirror image , incubus . And so Iona committed a kind of suicide : curbed her will and physical desire with the same whimsical violence she 'd once used to execute them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lovers  --  though now , curiously , since Tuka had gone home to Athens , there was nothing material to prevent it , or nothing but the fact that Iona 's heart had turned to iron and stone and cleansing sulfur fire . Iona'sp57hairline had begun to recede , there were shiny wrinkles crossingher forehead and fanning out at the corners of her eyes , and herflesh was no longer as firm as it had once been . Nevertheless , even now when I met her it was like meeting a dryad in thewoods . Her shape sealed off reality : beyond it , nothing of thesame intensity existed . She controlled me absolutely , and thoughI clowned , exaggerating the foolishness and invertebrate absurdityof my sad condition , neither of us misunderstood . I waited forher to assert her will , as I wait for the stars , and she did nothing . I learned the meaninglessness of space : the two women , one inAthens , one beside me , were equally remote . " Iona , my lovelyIona ! " I said , and wrung my fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flattered , but her eyes were ascold , as aleatory , as the Kyklops eye of Lykourgos . And so I believed , again  --  and thought I would go on believing  --  that everything was chance . But one day around twilight , whenI was sitting on a hillside where horses grazed , the strange convictioncame over me that there was no longer a city of Methone . I set out , that same night , walking . Three weeks later , when Iarrived at Messene , I encountered the first of the refugees laboring  --  emaciated , half crazed , silent  --  toward the sandstone ridgesof Stanyclarus . The war would come there too , I could have toldthem . The wheat-yellow plain would burn to white ash , thevillages would belch up smoke . I went on to Methone . Snowwas falling . There was no sign of the Spartiate army . No one hadburied the city 's dead . This time there could be no mistake . I hadforeseen it , I 'd known . But I 'd known what ? The sea stretchingout from Methone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were no birds . I saw what I took to be a corpse huddledon the stone stoop of a doorway . The arm moved , like a blackleaf stirred by wind . " Go away , " the old man whispered . " Plague ! " I fled.  |p58Agathon  : But this is clear : I loved my wife  --  loved her second only to adventuresand ideas . We were children together . My father was an oil merchant , well off but by no means nobly born . A kindly , gentle , reflective man . His chief hope of rising in the world , after the death of my beaming , extrovert younger brother , was my cleverness . ( No one could have guessed in those days that within a generation Solon 's middle class would be governing Athens . ) I was sent to a teacher by the name of Klinias , attached to the house of Philombrotos , Tuka 's father . He was an arkhon , her father ; a member of the all-powerful landed aristocracy , and one of the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klinias was no fool ( he had studied with Thales in Miletus ) , and I was , in my lugubrious , angry way , ambitious . I lived , along with another boy , Konon , in Klinias 's stone hut at the edge of Philombrotos'sgrounds , and when I was n't studying or rabbit-hunting or trying to ride some horse to death ( punishing all horses for my brother 's demise ) , I did chores , sometimes for Klinias , sometimes for Philombrotos . I first saw Tuka when I was working in the vineyard behind Philombrotos 's house  --  a small , private vineyard that served his kitchen . She was standing with her slave in a window high above me , looking down at me with a bold , steady gaze that unnerved me . I could n't guess how long she 'd been watching or what stupid thing I might have done in front of her . I was  --  what ? Nine or ten ? In any case , I was observed , like something in a cage , like something owned , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , of my social class  --  and hers . My father was a democrat who liked to talk about the grand contribution of the merchant class , but I was n't fooled . I did n't miss the exaggerated politeness with which he greeted the rich , and I did n't miss the eagerness with which he encouraged my study . The girl went on staring , and I worked faster , fuming . Someday I was going to be avenged . She was there again the following day . It must have been more than an hour she stood there ( her slave two steps behind her ) watching , smiling now and then , pretty much as you 'd smile at a turtle in a jug . I decided to ignore her , and I did , for perhaps three minutes . When I looked up again , she was gone . That was worse . I stood with my fists clenched , baffled , furious , staring into my half-filled basket . Then suddenly , as if dropped like apples from a limb or like gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  she and her two friends , girls , their slaves not far off , behind them . The three girls stood ten feet from me , their hands folded , their clothes clean and elegant , startling next to the homespun of ordinary workers . She said , " What 's your name ? " " Agathon , " I said . They laughed , and I knew I was blushing . " I 'm Tuka , " she said . Her voice was softer , gentler than wind in leaves . It filled me with alarm . I laughed scornfully , and she looked puzzled . I mumbled , " I have to work . " " We 'll help , " she said . I shook my head . " You ca n't . It has to be done right . A person like you  --  " She tipped her head far over to one side and looked at me . " I-Iow silly ! " she said . The half whisper resounded through me like a judgment . Thev laughed again , like birds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or alone except for her slave , and said , " I want you for my friend . " I said I could n't be . I had to study . She thought about it . " I bet there are things I know that you d n't , Agathon. "  |p60I  laughed . I knew where I was strong . Who but Konon and I could read Klinias 's book ? I said , " Like what ? " She thought again , then came to me and took my hand . A sensation stranger than touching a fledgling in its nest . After a moment she kissed my cheek . I was doomed . We played together throughout our childhood . She was a tomboy , a good head taller than I was . I liked her looks because she was my friend , but I knew in gloomy secret that , except for her dimples , her soft voice , she was ugly . Her head was enormous , and her nose , though handsomely shaped , was a size too large . She could n't compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit . She had the slyest tongue in Athens  --  a mind like lightning and that soft , near-whisper of a voice that kept her victim from knowing what had happened to him until he came to , days later , in his bath . Her father , who was elderly , in fact decrepit , neither approvednor disapproved , exactly , of our friendship . He was the busiest man in Greece : he knew only instants of his daughter 's life , and even those instants , when he gazed fondly out to where she played on the lawn , or when he watched her at her harp , were befogged by his official concerns . Or by his dearer love , to be exact . He had no time , no room in his heart , for any love but Athens  --  beautiful , albescent as an aging virgin , irrational , tyrannical , deep-dreamed as a wife inexplicably wronged . The city was his goddess . When he spoke to the assembly he pleaded like a lover or a supplicant , scolded like a husband or a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillared , honeycombed white buildings , chamber rising out of chamber , the rolling-gaited crumple-horned cows of the valleys below were in every syllable he spoke . For all the studied , peculiarly statuesque dignity of his bearing , he seemed , like any lover , a man perpetuallyat his wit 's end . It was the time of the war with the Megarians , and Athenian politics were in chaos . As I grew older I became involved in all that , as Klinias 's student . Tuka 's father knew me as a record keeper before he recognized me as Tuka 's beloved old playmate . I have no idea what games we played , through all those child/hood years . I know that we sometimes had long talks , the slave girl observing in silence from her place , and sometimes I tried to dazzle Tuka with a grim , disturbing theory I had about the prima materia . She was a master of pretending to listen , and sometimes she made me think of what I thought were brilliant things . They were wasted on her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I would listen for hours while she played the harp . It was a big concert instrument , studded with jewels , imported walnut braced with gold , a gift from her father on her twelfth birthday . He meant to make her the finest musician in Greece , and he nearly did it . When she performed for me ( or for anyone else ) she treated her playing lightly , casually , as though it had come with ease and had no great importance for her . If the fingers moving too fast for sight made some slight mistake , she would cavalierly repeat the mistake when the phrase returned and would build it into her variations , cunningly flaunting her pretended indifference to precision . But I knew  --  better than her teacher , perhaps  --  howfar she was from indifferent . Early in the morning , when the birds first began singing in earnest and all the herbs in Klinias 's garden and all the grass and shrubbery rising toward Philombrotos 's house were newgreen and bathed in dew , I would hear Tuka at her practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes like far-off herders ' bells , the tinkling high notes like leaves rustled by a breeze on a tree made of silver , but it did not seem for beauty 's sake she played . She would work one phrase again and again , doggedly , her mind calcinating by patient violence the stubbornness of fingers and wires . Hunched in the coolness of the morning , concentrating on Tuka from my patch of sunlight on the swept-stone steps of Klinias 's hut , I could feel her whole spirit contracting to that phrase , excluding all reality except for the ten or fifteen notes that refused to submit to her will . The phrase would come more and more quickly and lightly , and as her will gained ground she would begin to lead up to the troublesomephrase from farther back and from farther back still until suddenly  --  and I too could feel it  --  the recalcitrant phrase could no longer resist her but would fly by under her fingers as if by choice , like a storm in the wind god 's hand . Then suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem , she would move directly to her next problem  --  not even playing up to it , simply turning to it , single-minded as a spider  --  and the battle of music against wires and stubborn flesh would begin again . I would sit fascinated by Tuka 's mind  --  her compulsive need to appear casual and offhand in public , and the cold-bloodedness of her assault on beauty  --  until the first excitement of the songbirds waned , the dogs , roosters , and donkeys of Athens lost interest in announcing morning , and the brume on the Akropolis had lifted . Klinias would nudge me with his foot , and I would look up as if surprised , though I 'd been waiting for him to come drive me like a goose to my morning chores . I 'd jump up , clowning obsequiously , to go for water at the well beside the vineyard . But the best , and worst , was when Tuka played at night , alone . Sometimes it would be long after dark , and Konon and I would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp would float down to us . She would play , then , as if feeling were all there were in the world , and nature had no resistance . I would open my eyes and lie motionless , listening with every nerve to the music moving through the night 's deep quiet like a god out taking a walk . Konon , beside me , went on breathing slowly and heavily , untouched by it , and Klinias slept on in his tangled mass of covers , his horny feet protruding from the bottom , his crow 's nest of hair from the top . I looked from one object to another in the room , and everything that detached itself from the general dimnessstood transmuted . The large clay water jugs by the door had a new roundness  --  a volume and canescence that had nothing to do any more with space or time ; they existed in a new dimension , brimmed with amrita , like the music . The big wooden astrolabe in the window , suspended against the stars beyond like some enormous flying machine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , as if it had been transformed from a thing to a portent . Konon , whom I alternately loved and fought , one moment scorning him for his stupid ideas , his arrogant selfishness , his cunning , the next moment admiring him for an instant 's unexpected kindness , some leap of thought I could not have made , some comic sally I wished I 'd thought of  --  Konon , still as a sleepingchild beside me , his tanned arm resting close to my shoulderp63as though in his sleep he had reached toward me , became now clearly what he was , independent of moment-by-moment dissilience : my friend , mutable , infinitely valuable because the vision of eternality which the music gave implied that all of us would pass . The harp soughed on , sorrowful even when the phrases joked , and the whole night seemed to listen , brooding on itself . SometimesI would slip out of my bed , not waking Konon or Klinias , and would cross naked to the door and through it and up to Philombrotos 's big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledges of the polished stone by my fingertips and toes , and when I reached her window I would hang there watching her play . Her slave lay on her pallet , pretending to sleep . Tuka sat in her chiton , facing away from me , and her movements , as she played , were not like those I saw when she played for an audience : it was as if , now , she was inside the music , moving only as the music moved , swaying for an instant , hovering , sometimes touching the dark wood beam of the harp with her face as though the harp , too , knew the secret . I was torn by contradictory emotions , like the music , and , like the music , I turned them over and over , as if by feeling them intensely , not with my mind but with my body , I might grasp them . I felt outside time , as if all things merely temporal , coldly dianoetic , were of no importance , and I felt at the same time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness and plunge her obscenely , painfully into the world . But I hung undecided , the music moving in my chest like wind , like annulate waves , the cold night air moving softly across my skin , until my fingertips and toes ached from clinging , and I climbed back down . When I saw her by daylight it was as if what had happened in the night were unreal . The girl I had seen at her harp might easily have been anyone or no one , a spirit , but this daylit girl was Tuka , my friend , almost sister . There was , it is necessary to mention , a third Tuka , besides the musician and the tomboy-friend , and this third was Tuka-notquite-sane . I would stare in disbelief , shrinking back , wincing , struggling to make her fit with anything I knew of mundane reality . I could connect it with nothing I 'd ever felt  --  or , anyway , could remember feeling  --  and with almost nothing I 'd seen . Atp64times it wore the mask of rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or could manage to reconstruct later , an argumentwith her younger brother would suddenly turn to a conflict in which the clear and unquestionable goal was her brother 's death . She would say things , at such times , from which no human being could defend himself . For instance : " You 're stupid , stupid ! Your eyes are close together ! " Foolish , insignificant . Nevertheless , I would see him suddenly made helpless , limp-kneed as a man who 's been stabbed , and I would see the cold , hard shine of her face  --  oh , brighter , neater than a Spartan knife  --  and I would wait in horror for her to say it was only a joke , to tell him she did n't really hate him . But she would say more , as if the instant were final , there were no future mornings to get through with him : " You do n't know what people say about you , do you . Your ears stick out . Every time you turn your back , your friends all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could no more understand her dismissal of his humanness than I could , watching . If adults were nearby  --  even her slave  --  they would stop her . Her father would cry out sharply , " Tuka , go to your room ! " and she would go . The slave would whisper , " Tuka ! Tuka ! " I  --  we who watched  --  would be left numb , like people who have witnessed , on a clear spring day , a death fall from a horse . She went beyond all turning back , exactly like a wolf or a striking snake that has no idea of continuations . And yet , unbelievably , Tuka would make up , later . She would explain , as if kindly , apologetically  --  but cunningly laying the blame on her brother  --  " You made me mad . " He would distrust her , at first , as I was distrustful in later years when she did the same with me , but Tuka had dimples and a clever tongue , and the gods had given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened , and he would believe again that Tuka loved him . Partly this : she made the attack seem reasonable  --  madeit seem that some fault in her brother , or in me , later , explained her rage . And he  --  and I , later  --  would shift his attention to his innocence or guilt , and would forget the other-worldly reality , the murder . So once her father said to me with the same mad shine of the skin , " Get out of this house ! "  --  said it with such out-and-out avulsion that I would have done it except that I was not , or anyway not in the same way , crazy . I said , though I was ap65young man then , and arrogant , " I ca n't do that . I ca n't just walk out and take your daughter away forever . " Thinking : You shiteatingson of a bitch . The old man trembled and got hold of himself , scratched his way back to civility . Then again sometimes Tuka 's madness wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slave ; once she turned it on children . Her father 's house stood , as I 've said , on a hill . The lawn on the west side sloped down gently to a flagstone terrace where there were tables and benches of stone and , behind them , lilacs and high stone walls . Once , not long after I 'd first moved to Klinias 's hut , I stood watching timidly from the edge of the lawn , in the shadow of the roundhouse , near the palisade , while Tuka , three of her older cousins , and a number of younger childrenplayed near the house . The older cousins were boys , two of them very dark , the other light , with eyes as pale as well water . The younger children were playing with a wagon , a toy version of a four-wheeled mulecart . Tuka and the older cousins sat on the grass pulling up shoots and biting off the tips and talking loudly , teasing each other . The oldest of the cousins , one of the dark ones , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon , then changed his mind and pulled them himself . They let them , and he careened around with them , two at a time , scaring them and making them shriek with joy . He would cut the lawn 's slope , almost spilling them out , turning downward into the grade at the last moment , and sometimes he would pretend he was going to run them into the stone benches . The children in the wagon screamed with happiness . The ones who were n't riding yelled , " Me ! Pull me ! " Then  --  I do n't know whose idea it was  --  the game changed . Tuka and the older cousins lashed the tongue of the wagon to the wagon 's front panel so that the front wheels would n't turn , and they set one of the children in and sent him , with cheerful cries of " Hang on ! " and " You 're not scared , are you ? " clattering and bumping down the hill . They aimed the wagon away from the tables and benches , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ride by ride , toward the tables . I crept closer and hid behind the bushes at the edge of the lawn . My heart was pounding . Tuka said softly , lighter than a swallow , " He 's so stupid hep66wo n't even jump ! " And she laughed , a beautiful lilt , unreal as ghosts . I watched her line up the cart , talking and laughing with the child , and I watched her eyes as she started it down the hill . I watched the child 's face , ten feet away from me , when he realized he was going to hit . He screamed , but the cart made almost no sound as it struck . They came running down the hill . " Are you hurt ? Are you hurt ? " There was a splash of bright blood on the child 's forehead . They 're insane ! I thought . I meant rich people  --  all of them . But I was watching old Philombrotos 's daughter . If there are dead men who walk , or if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain path or beside some lake , they can be no more strange , no more removed from ordinary human feeling , than Tuka was at that instant . Klinias , passing my bed that night , paused and bent his head toward me nearsightedly . He cleared his throat , making the sharp Adam 's apple bob below his frail beard . " You comfortable , Agathon ? " I nodded , my covers pulled up to my nose . Though Klinias was rarely demonstrative , he leaned down , as if thinking it out as he did it , and tousled my hair . He said , " Homesick ? " I shook my head . He studied me , awkwardly tipping his starved-woodchuck head and frowning , lips pursed . The ceiling timbers were pitch black , sooty , above him . Then at last : " All right , youngster , come out with it . " He clumsily touched my shoulder . The fist was bony , and the punch hurt . In love as in almost everything , he was inept . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . I was crying at the end , as I had n't been able to cry at the time . My fellow student Konon watched me with a look that teetered betweenpity and scorn . I said , " Why did they do it , Klinias ? Why ? " He cleared his throat . " Do n't think about it . You just get to sleep , my boy . " He patted my shoulder and grinned , showing the holes where he 'd lost teeth . I whispered , " I think they 're crazy . " " No no , " he said . He stood up and cleared his throat againp67and tugged at his loincloth , and scratched one hairy , bare leg . " We all do strange things sometimes , " he said . But he stood there thinking for a long time , fiercely scratching his head , making the dandruff fall like snow . " You boys get to sleep , " he said at last , and went over and sat on his bed . His lips were pursed . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a man about to burp , and said , " We 'll talk this over in the morning . " But we did n't . It had one other mask . Once I was playing with Tuka and her younger brother , and one of us , I do n't remember which , broke a large clay amphora that stood just inside the door . Her father was passing , abstracted as usual , but the crash of shattering potterybrought him to himself . He said , " Tuka ! " Tuka and her brother ran out of the room , quick as snakes . It astonished me , but it did n't occur to me to follow . Her father walked past me , almost running , as though I were invisible in the dappled light , and called to her again from the doorway . She did n't answer , and he went after her . When I reached the doorway he was standing on the lawn , red-faced , sharp-nosed , the shadows of maple leaves splotching his cloak , and they were running from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past me again without seeing me , his gray mouth working in spasms . I said to her later , " Wo n't he get you , when you go in to eat supper ? " She smiled , showing her dimples . " He 'll forget by then . " " Still  --  " I said . " Oh , Agathon , Agathon ! " she said . I tried again . " If I were your father  --  " She clasped her hands as if in prayer and tipped her face , grinning . " You 'd get a huge net , and you 'd make these elephant traps all over the lawn , and you 'd get a sling full of sharp stones and nails and things , and you 'd get some slaves with bows and arrows that shoot flaming torches , and you 'd have these trained wolves and some puff adders and moray eels , and if some little child ran away from you  --  " Her brother laughed , wildly gleeful , and I too smiled . But all the same , it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could , because her way of thinking ruled out sober discourse  --  but justp68the same it was wrong , I thought , full of righteousness , to make a fool of a grown-up . Not because of what he could do to you . It was wrong to know that he would forget , even if he would ; wrong to know that he would chase you only so far and then stop . Do you love your father ? I should have asked . But I was too young to think of it , and she would n't have understood . Klinias said , " Ethics gives us generalizations , rules . Er-hem . But the first rule of ethics is : Never judge particular cases by general laws . " He nodded , pleased that he 'd thought of it , then strode on . I ran to catch up . We were climbing the old stone path toward where the shrine of Menelaos scrapes the clouds . He was teaching on the hoof , as he called it . I said , " Then ethics is nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do n't believe rules ? " " Fiddlesticks , " he said . " You take too narrow a view . Ethics is like medicine , to be taken only when needed . A man can enjoy good health in any number of ways . People who understand one another are beyond mere ethics . They can do things quite innocentlyto one another that it would be vicious to do to a stranger . " " Maybe , " I said . ( I was , as I 've told you , a morose and rigid young man . ) " But how will she know not to do those things to strangers ? " Klinias stopped climbing , leaned on his stick , and turned back to face me . He smiled . His hair shot out like red sunbeams . " My dear young Agathon , " he said , " you take this world too seriously . Look there ! " He pointed upward to where the big , rough bouldershung on the side of the bluff , the homes of eagles . " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed . He said , " They 're thinking of rockhood . " Klinias laughed . " Exactly ! They 're thinking , I am a rock , I am a rock . Not a tree , not a goose , not a goat 's blood pudding , but a rock . That 's what holds them together ! And what is our quester for truth , here , thinking ? " He laughed again and bobbed his head , delighted with himself . " He 's thinking : I am a human . Is Tuka Truman ? What is a human ? If he is n't careful , we 'll be carrying him home in loose atoms . " Konon jerked one shoulder and gave a sort of sneering grin.  | " Poor of Agathon 's in love , " he said . He ducked as if I were going to hit him and picked up a pebble to toss up and down . " In love ! " Klinias said , and looked at me in amazement . Then he laughed again . " Of course ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting myself in my wrath . " Here now , " Klinias said . " Here now ! " Konon went into a laughing fit , maybe at Klinias 's startled , stern face , or maybe at me . I went for him with my fists . Klinias was yelling , " Here here here ! " and banging the stones with his stick . The mountain walls screeched it back at him like crows . We were hardly aware , for all Konon 's teasing , that what we felt for each other was love . She was my closest friend , closer even than Konon . When we were in our teens I would sometimes walk with Tuka , holding her hand , her slave behind us , sullenly observing , but even then I misunderstood . I knew , I suppose , how I felt about her , but she was to me some higher form of life , as distant from me as a goddess would be from a cow . She knew other boys , lean and elegant , boys of her own class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was smarter than they were , I understood my lot . I chased and tumbled humblergirls , kitchen slaves mostly , and Tuka and I would sit on a hillside talking about them , refulgent as the sun-swept hills , and we would laugh and laugh . Her eyes sometimes flashed . I stubbornlymisunderstood . As was proper and right , of course . Her father was an arkhon : his land , his wealth , his power sprawled for miles . Then , when I was fifteen , I met Solon , who brought about a change , a whole new world . We were in Philombrotos 's high , timbered central chamber  --  five or six of the chief rulers of the city , my teacher Klinias ( dressed in the fine cloak Philombrotos had given him ) , Konon , and myself . I was often in on important deliberations at this time . I had no part in them  --  Konon and I took notes , carried unimportant messages , filled the wine bowls . As for Klinias , he was a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown , pink eyes gazing at his toes , and would never speak until Philombrotos would say , " Well ? " Klinias , who was extremelyp70nearsighted , would look up , vaguely in Philombrotos 's direction , pulling his fingers through his hair like a comb , and with great shrugs and greater pauses and throat-clearings that made his Adam 's apple bob , would deliver his delicately reasoned-out opinion . There were those who said in mockery that he was king of Athens . He was n't , but he had a kind of sixth sense about what the commoners would accept and what they would n't , and what they 'd do . It was Klinias who brought Solon to the attention of the oligarchy . " A profoundly philosophical person , " Klinias called him . Meaning : very tricky . It was a heady summer day , late afternoon : light splashed through the room like something alive , making every painted and polished surface gleam as if newly oiled . All the city leaders were gathered , including ' the older Pysistratos , all sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , Konon and I at our wooden desks , the slaves unobtrusively waiting in their places like furniture ; but the meeting did n't begin . I looked out at the hills and wished I was there . Then at last a slave came to announce a guest . Philombrotos stood up and bowed . Except for Pysistratos , who merely looked frosty , as usual , the others stood up too , as if the guest were someone like the King of Sardis . The slave reappeared , drew back the drape , and in walked the fattest , silliest-looking man I have ever met . ( Only Kroesos himself is said to have been fatter , who weighed seven hundred pounds . ) Solon was in his middle thirties , but nearly bald already . His nose was pink . No one needed to be told he was a wine merchant , without a drop of noble blood in his lineage -- despite what people say now . His flesh jiggled like a mile-wide field of flowers in a breeze . He spread his legs and stretched his milk-white arms like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Gentlemen , God bless you one and all ! " Klinias winced and focused his pink eyes harder on his toes . The slave closed the big door , bolted it , and stood waiting , holding the door hook . Pysistratos looked dour . Philombrotos said , " My friends , meet Citizen Solon . " They approached him gravely and tentatively and , one by one , shook his hand . " I 'm honored ! " Solon said . " Deeply flat-tered ! "  |p71Philombrotos  said , " Not only is Solon one of our city 's most brilliant merchants and a widely admired philosopher , he is , they tell me , one of the favorite poets of our commoners . " " A terrible condemnation , " Solon said . " Such taste ! " He kissed his fingers in despair . Philombrotos himself led Solon to his seat . They made a ludicrouscouple  --  Philombrotos tall and lean and frail , keen-eyed , masculine , sensitive to the point of palsy , Solon fat as a monstrous baby , with a face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan 's . Solon eased himself down , though the seat was marble , saying , " Thank you , God bless you ! " his flesh all aquiver , and he let out his breath in puffs . Philombrotos talked of Solon 's virtues . His father had been a wealthy man named Euphorion , a commoner who 'd proved that arithmetic could be worth as much as vast holdings , but who , in middle age , had decided to give away all he had to the poor . They 'd erected a statue in his honor . He 'd died when Solon was under twenty , and Solon , having what he called a modest taste for luxury , had in four years ( with a bare minimum of double-dealing , he often said ) made a fortune as large as his father 's . He had sympathies  --  and some influence  --  with both the rich and the poor , and he was famous with both for his extraordinary good sense . In these times of political chaos , no man was better qualified to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , as Solon was no doubt aware , but he accepted the flattery of the recitation , even relished it , tapping his fingertips and beaming like a child . They came at last to the point . The war with the Megarians had come to a kind of stalemate , not so much because of the difficulties of war as because the commoners believed they were being taken advantage of , which they were . It was always the commoners and slaves who were killed , the aristocrats  --  a handful of powerful families  --  who collected the spoils ; and whenever troubles came up at home , the war was blamed for their having to go unsolved . The problemwas simple : how to trick the commoners back into battle and beat the Megarians once and for all so that problems at home could , where necessary , be dealt with . Solon was radiant , gorging himself on the power the leadersp72were lending him , but though he could not hide his happiness , he pretended the thing was difficult . " Awesome ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He giggled , a laugh like a girl 's . " Simply awesome ! Gentlemen , we stand at the rim of a new and startling age  --  a whole new spectrum of human emotions ! It 's a thrilling and terrifying moment ! History will rememberus either as monsters or as midwives to gods ! Let us struggle to prove ourselves midwives , the Mothers of Humanism ! " " Humanism ? " Pysistratos said , looking skeptical . " It 's a new word I 've made up , " Solon said . " You do n't like it ? " They were offended , repelled by everything about him , not just his word  --  through no one in the room had any inkling yet that this pig would steal their power . But no one , on the other hand , could miss his confidence , and it was catching . You 'd have sworn by his manner that he had in mind some hero , completelyunknown to them , who could stand with the heroes of the First Age , like Theseus , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque , a sort of hog in the bath , he could solve their problems , they all knew , with a snap of his doughwhitefingers . " Let me think on it , " he said . He sat forward and rubbed his knees . " Let me pray on it  --  for a week . " " In a week 's time  --  " one of the leaders began . " Come come ! " Solon said . He threw up his hands in alarm . " Against the vast span of futurity  --  " They gave him a week . Solon had , as he said himself , a great advantage over them : he had no dignity . Within two days we heard the report that Solon had gone mad . He played the lyre half the night ( he had no ear , could hardly tell note from note ) , he danced stark nude , he approached wealthy ladies with obscene propositions . His family confined him to his house and went about in mourning . His physician let it out that he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran straight to the center of the city , with a tin cup and some leaves on his head and , pushing aside the more familiar nuts , prophets , soapbox orators , he climbed up onto the herald 's stand.  |p73When  people gathered around him , some in amusement , some in dismay , he began singing , thwanging out horrible noises on his lyre and rolling his eyes : " I come as a messenger from Salamis the fair ! The news he sends this town my verses shall declare ! " And then , in mad , mock-elegant dactyls , he called the commoners to one last valiant attempt against the Megarians , an attempt all their own , to be led by himself , indefatigable , mad Solon . The victory , he hinted , would bring on a whole new age for common men . He swore solemn oaths that Apollo was inside him . It was a long poem , and brilliant in its way  --  the best entertainment seen in Athens for years . If it was full of joking , it was earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-mockery , he had a childlike , merchant-class patriotism that could n't be scoffed away . When he talked of " a man 's debt to his country " it did n't sound hackneyed : it made you think , coming from Solon , of merchants ' iron cash boxes and the famous scrupulous honesty of the old-guard Atheniantradesman . It was a brand-new metaphor , in Solon 's mouth : more telling , at least for that audience , than all the silvery Homeric talk of Philombrotos . Some agreed to join him on the joyous impulse of holiday spirit , others because they believed the god  --  or anyway truth  --  was in him . ( That might seem strange to some people , but in Athens we were not of the opinion that gods are necessarily morose . Whatever strikes true , strikes deep and honest , whatever fills the furthest mountains with beauty and hope , we attribute to the gods . ) He got a fair party of men behind him , and Pysistratos , along with other civic leaders , got him more by sober reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd asked for , the leaders met with Solon again at Philombrotos 's house . He arrived late again , and this time he was carried in on a litter by four of his slaves . He had n't slept all week ; I doubt that he 'd eaten . He looked terrible . The leaders said nothing , but you could see they were distressed . This sick , decrepit thing that could barely wave its arms was to lead the Greeks to victory ! But they waited to hear what he would say . He told them his plan , and it was that afternoon thatp74I myself joined his army . I watched Philombrotos as Solon , with much ambiage , unfolded the scheme . The old man squinted in acute embarrassment . He could see that it would work , but I knew he would rather be dead than have beautiful Athens so deflowered . When the vote came , he abstained , and when he left , afterward , he did not speak to the others . I saw Tuka in the entry hall . " Praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . " I 'm going to be a soldier . " " You 're crazy , " she said . She stared at me hard , then laughed . " Are you going to talk them to death with metaphysics ? " " I may not be much with a dagger , " I said , " but I 'm sneaky . " She laughed again , but now she knew I meant it . I was lookingup with new eyes at where the Akropolis scraped the clouds . After a moment she took my hand . She said , " You ca n't . Iforbid it . " " It 's out of your hands , " I said . " I 'm a citizen of Athens . " She went on looking at me , then glanced back at her slave as if for help . None came . Tuka shook her head . " You have n't a chance . How you do overestimate yourself ! " I was angry . " I 'll pick on someone little , " I said . " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . " She turned away . The slave went on watching with eyes full of darkness . I started out and Tuka called to me . I kept going . Two weeks later I fought the only battle of my life . ( We trained like fools , that two weeks . Most of the men , though all of us were young , were veterans . All I learned was to be scared to death of good soldiers . ) Word went , by a supposed renegade , to Salamis , to tell the Megarians that , according to our ancient custom , the chief women of Athens were at Kolias , giving sacrificeto Keres , unattended except for their slaves . The Megarians could capture them with ease , for pleasure or ransom . The Megariansbit . We moved the women and children out and , cleanshaven , dressed like girls , we danced and played by the shore until the Megarians arrived . They came pouring out of the ship like unleashed hounds , and we danced and smiled and tightened our fists on our daggers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was horrible , a matter for shame . The one that came for mep75was a big , handsomish man that thought he would have me right there on the sand . I opened up his kidneys with both hands on the dagger , and the look on his face was like a child 's , shocked , betrayed . He pushed me away  --  there were people fighting all around us , bumping against us , stepping on us  --  and he lay twisting and kicking in a circle and I could n't get the dagger out . Blood spattered all over and soaked up in the sand and people slipped in it . I tried to strangle him , but even dying he was ten times stronger than I was . He pushed me away as if I were unimportant , an annoyance , like a swarm of gnats , in the way of his dying . I was crying so hard I could hardly see  --  a dead Megarian lay across my left leg  --  but I got a rock and lifted it over him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave up . I killed him . His look of indifference shook me to the heart . Then I lay in the sand and sobbed and yelled obscenities at Tuka . I believed I saw her , shining like a mountain , naked , smiling at me , her slave in the distance . A strange experience . When the battle was over we sailed for Salamis , still in our women 's clothes , all bloodied now , and took it . I did n't fight in that one . I was unfortunate , which no doubt saved my life . When I jumped to the rocks from the ship I broke my leg . I was in bed for two months . Tuka came to see me and talked to me very soberly , softly , about how a girl should n't let the boy she loved go to war without her blessing and promise . I was n't impressed , she was still old Philombrotos 's daughter . But the rustle of her skirt as she crossed the room , the small shy weight of her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel I was bleeding to death inside , hopeless , wicked , unpardonable . I was painfully , totally aware of her , as though her barely perceptible scent had replaced the air I breathed . I hated myself passionately , and , in my despair , blamed it all on her as I would on the gods if they were nearer . ( I had lied to her about the broken leg  --  she thought I was a hero . ) She said , looking away from my eyes and smiling , sly , that when I was well she had a gift for me . I got better at last , despite my wish , and agreed to meet her near a huge old olive tree behind the vineyard where we used to play , to collect the gift . I bathed and dressed myself elegantly , swearing and growling at myself all the time ( the mind is a tricky instrument ) ,  |p76and  , clenching my teeth and exaggerating my heroic limp , I went out to meet her by the tree . She was lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her slave sat at a distance , with her back turned . Sudden , scaring shame overwhelmed me and , beating on the ground with my fists , I told her of my lie . I was unworthy . She calmed me , drew down my face to her breast . I collected.  |p77Peeker  : O gods , gods , gods ! Was ever anything alive so cruelly mistreated ? I 'm being driven insane , and there 's no one I can turn to . I thought it was more damn flibbertigibbet when I read what he wrote , his plan for me . But he means it ! He 's going to unhinge me ! Yesterday we saw a murder , right before our very eyes  --  some fellow sneaking across the field , trying to stay out of sight in the tall grass , coming toward the prison  --  toward one of the cells farther down  --  and all at once there 's these two men on horseback galloping straight at the man out of nowhere , Spartan soldiers , and I heard the grass whizzing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest horse twist  --  that 's all I saw  --  and when they 'd gone by there was a javelin standing like a leaning signpost , and nothing , not even the javelin , was moving . It was as if I 'd been staring at the thing for hours , but that was a trick my mind played , because the riders reined up and turned back and I watched them get down and lift up the body and sling it across one of the horses , and then they remounted and rode off . " Agathon ! " I said . I sort of choked it out . But he was standing right behind me , he 'd seen it all . It was as if he 'd been expecting it . He shook his head and went back to the table . " It 's going to be a long , hard winter , Peeker . " I went ferocious for a minute . I sort of jumped at him and grabbed his crutch and I was going to club him with it . " Winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all you can say . It 's crazy ! Even if it 's a fucking metaphor it 's crazy . " He was waiting to be hit . I felt angrier than ever . The room went blood red . " People die right in front of your eyes and you just fart around , tell stupid shit-ass stories about girls and old dead politicians , and people are actually dying ! There 's some things a human being does n't have to stand ! " He rolled his eyes up at me . I had the crutch up to brain him . He said , " Nonsense . " I swung down . I do n't know what happened because I just flipped out , zero , a tingle across my brain and then nothing , as if it was me that was hit  --  Apollo maybe . I do n't know . I never saw anything like it . When I came to he was sitting on the bed , holding my head in his lap and patting me as if his mind was a million miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't find a lump when I felt around for one . I remembered I was going to kill him and I felt awful . He was a good old man , though he stunk to heaven , especially up close . I started crying , and he started patting me again . I said , " Master , I 'm going crazy . " " I know , " he said . His voice was thick , like a person 's at a funeral . The end of his beard touched my neck and tickled , and I thought how vicious it was that a person could be annoyed by a fucking tickle at a time like this . I cried harder . " I really am going crazy , " I said . " I know , " he said again . He could hardly bring it out , and I cried for him . After a long time he said , " Pecker , I 'll tell you something . " Suddenly , absurdly , his voice was cheerful . " Our jailer 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . This noon when he brought us our plates of smashed worms  --  or whatever it is  --  he stood outside my cell door with his arms folded for half an hour , watching me eat . I ate , first my plate then yours , very slowly and delicately  --  partly because it 's the only way I can trick my stomach into willingness , partly to teach him fine manners by my example . When I finished I wiped my lips very nicely with the piece of my robe I reserve for the purpose , and I said to him , Jailer , I 'll tell you an interesting fact . Everything we study , wep79modify by our study of it . Hence truth eternally eludes us . ' " He did not look convinced , just held out his hand for the plates . " Take crabs , for example , ' I said . We poke them with a stick to find out how they behave , and they behave as if poked by a stick . ' " He folded his arms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course a very simple example , ' I said . Take a subtler example , such as atoms of light . Light , as you know , is one of the four great elements  --  in common parlance , fire . We study it by bouncing it off polished stones , or bending it in water , or squeezing it through holes . And how does it behave ? It behaves as if bounced or squeezed or bent . We learn nothing . We merely cause events . ' I bent closer to him , waving my finger to keep his attention . Has it occurred to you that sundials do not measure time but create it ? ' It had not , I saw . Time , ' I said , is actually a thing , like porridge . ' I folded my arms and beamed at him , triumphant . The left side of his mouth twitched very slightly . He withdrew . " " Master , you 're insane , " I said . He smiled . " That 's more like it ! Before you were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's youthful arrogance . " We laughed . When I woke up again it was dark . He was patting my head . When it came back to me I said , " Who was it , master ?  --  the one they killed . " " Some Helot , I expect . " " Was it someone you knew ? " He did n't answer for so long I thought he 'd forgotten the question , but then he said , " No doubt . " " And you did n't think anything about it ? " I realized I was lying with my head in his lap and I felt silly . He was saying : " Oh , a thought or two may have passed through my mind . I may have thought how brave and virtuous the man must have felt , sneaking across to the prison . And I may have thought how brave and virtuous the soldiers must have felt , nailing him down like a rabbit . I may have had a passing thought about rabbits , or field mice , or stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eyes . I was still seeing it  --  the horses , the javelin sticking up like a signpost . " You don'tbelieve in anything , do you ? " " I believe in the gods , " he said . I said , " Hah ! " " That too , " he said . " Magic is afoot when a doomed youngman says Hah ! ' " Doomed . I began to shake all over . He launched some idioticstory.  |p81Agathon  : Lykourgos , in his time , was a great general , though one very different from Solon . He comes , after all , of Dorian stock , and he once wore all the dignity of a king . Philombrotos greatly admiredhim , during his stay in Athens , and he would have admired Lykourgos still more if he 'd lived to see him lead his crack troops into battle . You would hardly find them in girls ' dresses , with coy smiles , and flowers in their hair . They train naked , hour on hour in the summer heat or the winter wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like pliant wood . They learn to fight , as they learn to march , with precision , every movement clean as the closing of a trap . The iren gives his signal and they draw their swords as if with one single muscle . He calls out again and they advance a step like the spikes of a single harrow . I can not tell whether to laugh or shake in terror . When a man moves his hand by an inch too much , the iren signals him out of formation and bites his thumb . The man does not scream . Not a muscle of his face stirs . When they fight they wear breastplates and groinplates of metal , and feathers in their hair like the Philistines . ( The Dorians were neighbors to the Philistines once , generations ago . The two people are very much alike , but the Philistines have had no Lykourgos . ) As they march to the attack , the Spartans play their flutes , a piercing , deadly singsong thing in the Lydian mode , with no trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city , kill everything alive in it down to the humblest dog , andp82send their ultimatum to the next . All this is Lykourgos 's work . Only a fool would deny that it 's effective . I had been working under Solon for six months  --  and had been married a year  --  when Lykourgos arrived in Athens . I was twenty . Solon had as yet no official position ( it was that year that Philombrotosdied and Solon replaced him as arkhon ) , but he was in fact already what Klinias had been called in jest , king of Athens . Philombrotos and his fellow arkhons , and even Pysistratos himself , did nothing without Solon 's consent , yet they hated all Solon stood for . Philombrotos knew , as everyone did , that when and if Lykourgos returned to Sparta it would be as Lawgiver , exactly the position Solon was worming , or rather pigging , his way into in Athens . When he found the two men in the same town , Philombrotos could n't help himself : he had to bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assigning him three of his best slaves , and invited Solon to dinner . I too , along with Tuka ( and many others ) , was invited . Though I lived in the house , I did not see Lykourgos until the night of the dinner . He kept to his room like a sick man or a misanthrope  --  both of which , I soon discovered , he was . Philombrotos went to visit him , and they would talk , with the slaves outside the door , for hours . I can imagine how it was . For old Philombrotos , the world was falling apart . A fat wine merchant was the city 's only hope , and if he saved the city it would be at the expense of what made the city fine . It would be like saving a beloved wife from enemy spears by whoring her . He was beginning already to talk in a politely disparaging way of Draco 's laws , " written in blood , " he said . He would giggle as he said it . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt on those visits to Lykourgos 's room , Philombrotos sat in troubled silence , trembling faintly , as he always did the last few years , and Lykourgos delivered sentencia in his quiet , angry way , like talking stone . The old man could n't help but agree with all Lykourgos said , but he could see no way to get from where Athens was to Lykourgos 's iron vision . In his own house common blood had seized a place . Tuka , pregnant ( or so we thought ) , had threatened suicide if she could n't marry me . She meant it , at least at the moment . Or if she did n't , Philombrotos couldn'tp83be sure . There 'd been a wave of suicides among the old families in recent months . ( " Changing times , " Solon said mournfully , rolling his eyes up , looking pious . ) Philombrotos wept . He was too weak from his civic troubles to fight . When we met in the halls , now , we bowed as we had in the old days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgave the old arkhon , and I did not mind my victory . I was Solon 's aide , and Solon was the future . But Solon was a better man than I. When he learned of the invitation he was distraught . It was dusk , and we were sitting in the room in his house where he did all his reading and writing . ( He read as he ate , gluttonously , and he kept a book like Klinias 's , as if he fancied himself a sage . ) The room , that evening , was full of shadows . He was always strangely reluctant to light his lamps before nightfall . I could never tell whether it was miserliness or one of his superstitions . ) He said , " This is awful ! Horrendous ! It ca n't be done ! " He pulled at his cheeks with his fingertips and made nervous clicking noises . " Why not ? " I said . I took great delight in undoing his grandiose posturing . That was , I think now , my chief use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively dignified man , considering . " It 's unthinkable ! " he said . He had a habit of filling the air with exclamations while his mind raced ahead , figuring . " It 's one thing to borrow a poor old man 's nuptial bed as if by drunken mistake . It 's another to make him bow and humbly abandon it to you . " I shook my head , smiling . A new kind of Midas . Everything he touched turned obscene . He fiddled with the stick on his desk that he kept for luck , still tsking and clicking like a carter . " You know what he 's after . He wants to set us side by side and see whose way is best . But he has no choice ! Why ca n't old men be reasonable ? " " I imagine he knows he has no choice , " I said . I was thinking of myself and Tuka . " Then he 's one of those people "  --  he lowered his voice  --  " who make their slavegirls whip them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came to me that he was chiefly embarrassed for himself , thep84figure he 'd cut . " You 'll come off all right , " I said . " You 're an Athenian . " " No I wo n't , " he said . He pouted . But he thought a mornent and his face grew foxy . " Yes I will ! " He sent me home . The night of the dinner , Solon was , to no one 's surprise , late . The wide room was filled with dignitaries . We were just beginning to eat without him when a slave announced his arrival . Philombrotos got up , with difficulty , and took a step or two toward the door . Solon came in , spread his legs apart and threw out his arms , exactly as he had the first time I 'd seen him . " Gentlemen , God bless you ! " he said . And then , to Philombrotos : " Forgive me . I 've taken a liberty . " He waved at the door , where his house slave waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korinthian , I think  --  came in wheeling a cart of Spartan wine . Where Solon had gotten it , God only knew . No Athenian would normallydrink the stuff , though the Spartans vow by it . Exiguous food and drink is their national emblem . Solon snatched up a bottle from the cart and held it aloft as if it were captured treasure . " To the grandeur of Sparta ! " he said . For an instant everyone was stunned . Who 'd ever heard of a thing so unpatriotic ? And yet it was n't , of course . His words pierced some ludicrous old error . Then , first one or two , then more , we all cheered and laughed and even clapped . Lykourgos 's features worked as if in agony . At last he too laughed , seizing his pleasure as if to strangle it . " Bless my soul ! " he said . It was like a voice from the heart of a cave . Solon sat down in his place of honor by Lykourgos and talked all that night about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his on the white wines of Sparta . Philombrotos watched him , baffled and weary , like a man brought against his will from beyond the grave . Two days later , at Solon 's house , Lykourgos said : " The trouble with a genius is that he dies . The state falls to ordinary men , and they destroy it . " They were talking of Solon 's wild improvising . Solon smiled . " I 'd rather be destroyed by ordinary men than by System . " " In my system , " Lykourgos said , " there will be no ordinary men . "  |p85Solon  thought about it and nodded . " True , perhaps , " he said . " And when you die , there will be no room for genius in all Lakonia except your grave . " That night , Solon gave me a sheaf of writings . " Read these , " he said . " Tell me what you think . " I glanced at them and knew whose they were by the handwriting , though it was one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and severe as Lykourgos himself , and even harder to decipher . I said , " Shall I take them with me ? " He nodded , thinking about something else . " If you lose them , God help us both . " They were aphorisms , fragments , God knows what . I took them with me and , compulsive scrivener that I am , copied some of them down . I included them later in the book , when I got it from Klinias . Our vanity would like what we do best to pass for what is hardest for us . Slaves make a difficult virtue of acting like slaves . The will to overcome an emotion is only the will of a stronger emotion . Opinion is desire . Strong character , virtue , means shutting the ear to even the best counterarguments . Madness in individuals is rare ; in groups it is the rule . Good government is predictable , and irreversible , psychosis . That which each age considers evil is the atavism of an old ideal . Every system of morals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , no objection , unless one should decree , by some system of morals , that tyranny and unreasonableness are bad . Religion , politics , and art all give us herding-animal morality ( Thou shalt not shove ) . By what secret rules do the great priest , the great king , and the master artist live ? The great State is the mechanical image of some great man . It has no faults he did not have , though it can not have his virtues . Good . Private virtues make empty talk at parties.  |p86Im|prisonment  and execution are not great evils , merely mirrors , too clear for cowardly eyes , of reality as it is . Greatness is impossible without religion . A man must know himself God . I returned the parchments to Solon . He said , " Well ? " " Stark raving mad , " I said . " Terrible , but not insane . " He tapped the desktop with his stick . " I admire his courage . It 's going to be a great experiment  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He giggled . I shrugged . " So when he gets it going , go see it . " His eyebrows went up in alarm . " Good heavens no ! I 'll send some friend . " He smiled . " Do n't look at me , " I said . " Do n't worry . " He laughed . " When the time comes , you 'll beg me to let you go . You see , you 're a tyrant . His mirror image . " " That 's not true , " I said . He really seemed to mean it . " What makes you say that ? " " Sheer whimsy , my love . " He laughed again , glancing over at his slave . Solon 's mind , I could see , was far away . I told Tuka later what he 'd said . She said , more soft , more sweet than morning bells , " It 's really true , you know . You 're a tyrant . " She had a marvelous capacity for defending the wrong if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , for some reason , I was persistent . It was this , partly : she had an irritating way of forever comparing me with her father . Either her father was good at something , like taking care of the tedious details of daily life , busy as he was , and for me it was simply impossible , or else her father was bad at something , like listening to things his family said , and I was exactly like him . It was her father she wanted to be married to , not me . " Tell me one single thing that I ever did that was tyrannical , " I said . She sighed as if there were thousands and took my hand . " Agathon , look at your fingernails . That 's disgusting ! " But Solon 's prediction was right , in a sense . It was at my re/quest that , two years later , after travels for Solon had inclined my spirit to wandering , I went with Tuka to Sparta . Lykourgos had just pulled his money trick . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was skirting war hour by hour , straddling the chasm between the commoners and Pysistratos . ) Lykourgos 's nightmarishvision of men was becoming actuality . I had to see it . It may be I thought I could stop it . One last word on all that . The truth is , I was much impressed by Lykourgos 's Sparta when I arrived . Though I came full of scorn , even humanistic outrage  --  though also full of admiration for any man who could bring it off  --  I was impressed by the studied simplicity of the world Lykourgos had recreated . I saw his whole scheme , now that I was here , in the simplest and most lucid terms , and I was amazed at my former narrowness of vision . A matter of simple geography . Sparta was agricultural , required a huge labor force  --  not slaves but something almost slave , because that many slaves would be a threat to the master race  --  and required , above all , the reactionary temper which keeps a farmer regular of habit and stable . Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flexibility . Neither was right or wrong , then : the Just Life was a mythological beast . I would study the world for its images of aspects of myself . I wrote poems about it . For example : Is it utter fancy that once one 's mindwas clear , one 's heart pure ? fancy that once one 's will inclined to what one loved for sure ? On a stone road where donkeys grazed high slopes above our heads , and rocks like giant wolf skulls gazed at the vast march of clouds , we found a small , improbable stone shrine  --  a barren placewhere none would watch but a carved wood dollwith a staring , Dorian face.  |p88Carnations  bloomed inside the shrine and coins lay on its stone ; someone had swept to the road 's rim where the cliff wall rushed down . A mile beyond that , high in the hills past ruined silver mines , juts that once spanned waterfalls , old houses choked in vines , we reached a huge gray-granite churchsome god had pushed akilter . Children played at its black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , donkey path , two young workmen , blackened as if by fire , smiled , holy , then moved on , patient as old desire . Well , good . Who past the age of two has not experienced a hunger for simplicity ? I wrote many poems of this kind when I first came to Sparta . But enough of that . I have been , like Lykourgos , a desperate man all my life.  |p89Peeker  : " You 'll never make a Seer , " Agathon tells me in a voice of scorn , trying to nag me into it . But I 'm no longer fooled . It 's true . I wo n't . I do n't even want to be anymore . I watch him sitting at the table , breathing with his mouth open  --  the August heat 's deadly for a man as old and fat as him  --  writing , writing , hour after hour , not all the wisdom he 's collected from sages but the squalid details of his onion-stinking life : I see him wake up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering his project ( he 's writing it all for my sake , he says ) , and I see him stand up at the side of his bed , trembling all over , tasting his sunken mouth , dusting his lips with his dry tongue  --  then he splashes water from the corner bowl over his moustache and beard and forehead ( like King Soos , I think , and laugh ) , then wipes it off with the back of his hand  --  all this absentmindedly , thinking only of his crackpot project ; and I think , Where 's your spooky gift gotten you , old man ? " Mus ' get busy , " he mumbles , and glances out through the cell door , worried , checking what time it is by the slant of the sun . It was different , in the beginning . I had personal problems , you might say , and Agathon was some kind of hope . I do n't know . I 'd be peddling apples with Mother , and she 'd keep saying things to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them baskets , Demodokos . Money do n't grow on trees , you know . " And sometimes , to herself , " Spare the rod and spoil the child . " And then she 'd holler , " Biffins ! Snow apples ! Fresh as a day inp90spri-ing ! " I would hurry along behind her , trying to catch up I to where she went striding like a war-horse , eyes like a rooster 's , her back loaded like a mule 's . She could carry four times what I could carry , and she liked to remind me of it . " It 's not my fault , " I would say . " When I was little you did n't feed me right . " " Hah ! Accusing his poor mother ! " she would say . ( But she liked it when I stood up to her . I 'd hear her telling people , " He 's not much to look at , good Zeus knows . But he 's got spirit ! He 'll be my death ! " ) I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a bunch of those girls would go past , Spartan girls naked as jellyfish , and I 'd look down as long as they were coming towardme but as soon as they passed I 'd peek back at them , those beautiful beautiful swinging asses , sleek and powerful and arrogantas the hams of deer , and all the muscle and bone would go out of my knees and the apples would go rolling . " Mind them baskets , Demodokos , " Mother would say . Sometimes as they passed they would swipe a couple of apples from the basket and would smile at me , and that was worse than anything . I wanted to talk to them , ask them what their names were and where they lived . But I was afraid . As I got older  --  fifteen and sixteen and seventeen  --  I thought I 'd go out of my mind . My mother kept watching me , watching , watching , watching . " Stick to your own kind , " she 'd say when she 'd see me sort of peeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt the same thing with Helot girls . I would strip them with my eyes , imagine the blush around the nipples , the softness of bush between their legs , and then when I looked back at their faces I would practically faint from the beauty of their mouths and eyes , wanting to say " Hi ! "  --  wanting to tell them I cared about them , tell them I 'd listen to whatever they might wish to express , listen for ninety-nine years . I wanted to know if they were happy , what they dreamed at night , what they liked best to eat . I would watch them talking with good-looking boys or the boys that could always think of something funny , or the moody ones with knowing smiles , and then I 'd look at how skinny my arms and legs are and I 'd want to kill myself . Sometimes when we were peddling we 'd see Agathon . My mother would give him a wide berth , merely working the crowdsp91that gathered when he talked . Sometimes she stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that he always had crowds . Sometimes he 'd be sitting all alone , sprawled out over some steps with his thumb hooked in the jug handle , and he 'd be singing , louder , more raucous than thunder . Or sometimes he 'd just be standing on a corner , like a blind man waiting for help across the street . Sometimes he 'd be playing with children . They liked him  --  they always liked crazy people . He 'd try to skip rope with them , clinging with both hands to his jug and gasping for air like a weight lifter as he bounced , kicking out one foot , then the other . He drew large crowds when he wanted to , though , because of the crazy way he talked and because of the way he could mimic people : you 'd swear the man he was mimicking was inside him . But naturally what the crowds liked best was his prophecies . He would n't do that often . He had to wait for the mood to come over him , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he was leaning on a horse . ( Horses make impressions come , he says . He used to make me lean on horses sometimes when he was trying to teach me to get holy impressions . I hate horses . The smell makes me sick , and if I shut my eyes , feeling woozy , they turn around and bite . ) Anyway , when we 'd see him prophesyingI 'd go watch from way in back , jumping up and down to see . " Come away from there , " my mother would say . " A man 's known by the company he keeps . " And sometimes he 'd preach . " Your bodies are naked , pretty ladies , but your minds are tucked away like things obscene ! " Once he said , exactly in the voice of an old woman we knew , " Husband , talk to me ! You have n't spoken a word in sixteen years . " The old man Agathon was pointingat was a garrulous fool , but what Agathon said was like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then one day as I was working my way around the edge of the crowd selling apples with Mother , the old man pointed his horrible shaking finger at me and yelled , " You , you miserable misbegotten wretch ! Why such sorrow on this day of joyous festival ? " I could feel the whole crowd 's eyes on me , and my heart was like a hot coal at the root of my throat . I tried to be smart-aleck : " Because of girls , " I said . " Oh , master , all because of girls ! He he he ! " The whole crowd laughed , but the Seer'sp92eyes were solemn as the plague . He said nothing . The crowd grew still . Then he said , " The gods are in that boy ! " Everyone was scared . The old man said , " Come with me ! " Everyone was looking at me . My feet started moving toward him : I could n't do a thing about it , even when my mother started screaming . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because my legs had gone weak . He got down on his knees too , so he could look me in the eye . He was breathing hard , excited . " I 'm going to make you a Seer , " he said , and smiled . The holes in his teeth were like craters . You 've got no choice , when a Seer says a thing like that to you  --  even if you know for a fact he 's a crazy old drunk . Which I did n't , for that matter . You never know anything about a Seer , unless you happen to have such bad luck as to become a disciple . I mean , they 're special , mysterious . A little like the ephors used to seem to me , or the revolutionists when someone would whisper , pointing them out in a crowd . I remember the first time I saw one . Someone said , " Look ! That 's Wolf . " That was what people called him , not his name . I followed the furtive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The one with the gray sash , " someone said . He turned , just that instant , and I saw his face . He looked like anyone , mouse-colored curly hair , quiet , friendly eyes . You could n't believe he had killed people , gutted buildings with midnight fire . He nodded , seeing me staring at him . Maybe he thought I was someone he ought to know . I nodded back .  --  But all that 's not the point . I might have passed him a hundred times and never given him a second thought ; but now , now that I knew he was a famous revolutionist , he was a riddle , unfathomable , no longer Helot , no longer even human , some baffling and terrible alien . I saw one die once , an execution . Snake , they called him . He 'd been blinded and beaten horribly , but he was awesome . He died like a god , almost laughing at us , holding back only from gentleness and pity . Even the Spartans felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might stink like a man , he might share certain features with ordinary men  --  two eyes , a nose , a beard , a paunch  --  but he was special , set apart . His mind was different from a merely human mind . Augurers , now  --  the people who pretend to read the future from bones or goats '  |p93intestines  or the flight of birds  --  they 're not special ; they know it themselves . Either there really are things in bones or guts or patternsof flight that have readable meaning , and they know how to read it , or there are n't , and the augurers are fakes . Either way , it 's no stranger than reading from a parchment , or pretending to read when you ca n't . But Agathon , he can run his hands over a cane and say , " The man who owns this cane once murdered a chicken farmer . " Or he can become very still , standing in a field as if listening to the wind , and it will come to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's crazy , of course , to think he can teach me that . It 's a gift , for better or worse . And because it 's natural , easy for him , he thinks if I learn to relax or something , zonk ! I 'll get a vision . I used to try . I 'd practically pass out , trying . He 'd stare and stare , trying to figure out what the hell I was doing wrong . His face , his whole body would become a mirror of mine , trying to feel out in himself where my mistake was . He 'd say , " You have n't suffered enough , boy . That 's the trouble ! " His eyes would be glittering like sunlit pits of ice , and I knew as sure as day what he was thinking . He was going to get me beat up , or kicked by a mule or something . I 'd keep clear of him . It was for my sake , he said , that he started us prowling the streets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a lie . He 'd been doing it for years and the only difference now was that he did n't have to drag his own jug . I should have left him as soon as I knew for sure I would never be a Seer . I thought of it . Time after time . But then I 'd find him in the road , knocked down by a cart or something , and I 'd see that his moustache was all gucky with blood , and I 'd be scared . He 'd do it on purpose , I think , to keep me with him . Or else one day he 'd pause , looking puzzled , in front of some house , and after a while he 'd go in and we 'd find some woman crying , and tears would be streaming from his eyes too , and there 'd be a young man sitting in the corner , dead . And so I stayed on  --  a victim of Destiny . It was sickening , but I was trapped . The same way Alkander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once . I was close enough that I could have reached out and touched him . Lykourgos had been walking in the squarep94in front of the Hall of Justice , and Agathon had caught sight of him and had run up to him , wringing his hands and making faces and God knows what  --  and Lykourgos stopped , looking sad , tragic even . " Agathon , for the love of God , " Lykourgos said , very low , soit no one would hear . He stood with his arms slightly bent , his hands hanging limp , as though Agathon were a terrible torment to him . " Have I offended thee ? Have I offended thee ? " Agathon squealed . " Agathon , " he said . It was like a plea but also like the warning growl of a dog . I watched Alkander . He stood two feet behind Lykourgos , towering over him , naked except for his sandals , the sword and dagger harness , the wide iron bracelets on his wrists  --  they too were weapons . He looked casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balls of his feet , and his eyes were closed to slits . His mind closed out everything in the world but Agathon . Should the old man so much as spit in the direction of Lykourgos 's feet , he 'd be dead before the spittle hit the pavement . I tried to say " Let 's go home , " but my throat was dried up with fear . " The revolution 's upon you , Lykourgos , " Agathon said . " I warned you ! I warned you ! As long as time lasts , you 'll be known as the murderer of a thousand thousand men . And all for blind ego ! " He cringed , leering and winking , but I saw that he made no move to touch Lykourgos . " I have n't offended thee , I hope ? You see how it is , sir . The god says Speak ! ' and I speak . " " The god indeed ! " Lykourgos said . He tried to turn away , but Agathon was around him , quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hand closed over his beard , his one eye patiently staring at the pavement . " You tell me of pride , " he said . " Shame , Agathon . Shame ! " Agathon grabbed hold of his belly and laughed . " Brilliant ! " he yelled . " 0 philosopher ! " He laughed and laughed , but he was furious . Alkander watched him . " I 've given up Athens , my wife , my children , even poetry , to cry out a warning in the savagep95Spartan wilderness , and you say it 's from pride ! " He was drooling in his rage , but still faking laughter . I too , like Alkander , watched him . He was wrong : the anger proved it . But Lykourgos was incapable of answering his scorn . The old Lawgiver 's mind and heart were as simple and rural as a barn : I could see in his patient , mulish stance all the country generations that led up to him  --  fierce men plowing straight furrows behind oxen ; farm owners rising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrashers ; country politicians , red-faced and laconic , campaigning not with clever appeals but with facts drawn up like wagons . " We 're old men , you and I , " Lykourgos said . " Let 's come to truce . " " 0 deathless gods , hear what he asks of me ! " Agathon said . " 0 motionless mild Apollo , behold this indignity done my old age ! " He was wrong . Any fool could see it . Even if Lykourgos was all he said , an enemy to the laws of earth and heaven , still Lykourgos was a man , had rights . He could burn cities with one word , but he could n't get justice from Agathon , yet was too just a man to destroy him . Alkander saw it too . I do n't know how I knew that , but I knew . The crease beside his mouth moved like a tingle in the back of your mind , but he did nothing . I wanted to talk to him , let him know I understood how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alkander 's a machine , a sort of walking weapon to protect the old man , but I knew better . I would have let him tell me whatever he wanted , and I would have kept all his secrets safe . " Hate is bad for digestion , " Lykourgos said . " Like murder , " Agathon said , and laughed a little wildly . " Like war . Like plague . " Sudden as August heat lightning , Lykourgos lost his temper . " Go home , you sick , fat old fool . Go home before Alkander breaks his leash ! " Agathon laughed , but immediately backed away . " Rage on , old one-eyed maniac , " he said . " Your world is crashing down around your ears ! " Lykourgos raised his head a little and his one eye bored intop96Agathon . " My laws will survive , " he said . " Among my enemies , you alone know the future , and you alone rave . A sign of your despair . " Agathon spit , not just in Lykourgos 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jerk , but the rest of him kept still , almost relaxed . I sidled away , following my master . " I 'm sorry , " I whispered . Alkander slid his eyes over and looked at me , angry at first , then thoughtful . A week later when I saw Alkander it seemed to me  --  though I could n't be sure  --  he nodded . So anyway , this : I will never learn to be a Seer , but I 'm learningthings , with Agathon . It occurs to me that I have learned to be patient with everyone but Agathon himself . And with my own self , of course . . . For Agathon , and for myself , I have no forgiveness . Why is that ? But the walls of our cell are close , remember , close as the air we gasp to breathe , and Agathon makes no effort to hold back his farts . He snores and moans and grumbles in his sleep , and he talks talks talks incessantly , about nothing but himself , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he 's seventy , " I tell myself . " An old man must have some privileges . " But when he wakes up he smacks his lips , and when he eats I hear his teeth cracking . And when he is n't talking or cracking his teeth or sucking at his dry , loose , black-cracked mouth , he 's writing his endless , revolting life story , mile on mile of selfcongratulation . " Pecker , my good man , sharpen my pen . " " You sharpen your own fucking pen , " I say . " Ah , manners , dear boy ! There is no pulchritude in swinish manners ! " Pursing his lips as he says it . Squinting like a pig . Why should I work up forgiveness for an ugly , sick-minded old man who scorns everything on earth but himself ? Or maybe especially himself . And why should I resign myself to what I am  --  lackey for a madman , hungry maggot in a hole full of maggots , dreaming every night of soft-bosomed girls with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springtime , with eyes as lonely as graves ?  |p97Agathon  : I sat with Dorkis on a hillside , looking down on the lake where Iona , Tuka , and the children  --  our two and their three  --  were swimming . It was a fine , warm day , and we 'd been drinking Helot wine all afternoon . The little stone aerie he 'd borrowed for what he called his flight to meditation stood above and behind us on the hill . I kept watching Tuka and Iona , my chest full of pain . I Dorkis talked . He was thinking of leaving Lakonia . It was against the law , but Helots managed it every day . The Spartans did n't waste much time policing Helots in those days ; they kept busy enough policing themselves and making incursions into the holdingsof their neighbors  --  the ephors ' idea , not Lykourgos 's . Goats grazed to the right of the lake and beyond it . The boy who was watching them sat , just visible to us , on an outcropping of greenish rocks near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hopelessness of the Helot situation . There had always been atrocities . The ephors formally declare war on the Helots every year , so that a Spartiate wo n't be guilty of religious impurity if he kills a Helot out of hand . But it 's always worse in time of war . Because of the troubles in Messenia  --  in town after town , Spartan governors had been assassinated and public buildings burned  --  and also because of the increasing numberof Helots openly talking rebellion  --  Lykourgos had recently revived the old institution of the Krypteia , whereby young Spartan warriors were sent out into the countryside with an iron ration and a dagger , to hide among the rocks by day and killp98Helots by night . It gave the young fighters combat practice  --  but that was only part of it . Helots far outnumbered Spartiates throughout Lakonia , and Lykourgos was convinced that in unsettledtimes the Helots needed terrorizing to be kept in place . At all events , a young man Dorkis knew had been murdered two days ago by Spartan boys , and Dorkis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparing the body for burial . It had shaken him . His voice had a new thinness , like that of a man recuperatingfrom a loss of blood . There was a sense in which it was criminal , he said , for a Helot to bring up children in Sparta . It robbed them of self-respect , which was to say , freedom . On the other hand , he was a leader of a sort . Now , if ever , the Helots needed leaders . I acknowledged it with a nod . It was not a decisionI cared to help him with . I myself would leave , probably . I 'm easily scared off . I could have said that running away might alsorob his children of self-respect , but I could n't advise him to do what I might not have the courage to do myself . His sharp , black-eyed stare was fixed on something beyond the farthest of the hills , and his lower lip was pushed forward , making his cheek muscles taut , the slanted eyes little chinks , like slits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with him ? " I shook my head . " Not a drop . " He grinned . " How 'd you blow it ? " " I never had it to start with , " I said . " He keeps me around to tell him Solon 's theories , which I do  --  I have them all down in my book  --  and he listens like a stone . " " Does he really ? " " No . He sort of half listens . But the contrast is somehow obscurelyuseful to him . " He swung his gaze back to the hills . " Could he be killed , do you think ? " He asked it as one would ask for predictions on the Olympic games  --  except that his voice was feeble . I kept quiet . He had his elbows on his knees ; his hands hung perfectly relaxed . At last he said , " You have n't answered . I take it he could , then . " " Anything alive can be killed , one way or another . " li1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bullfighter watching the parade before a fight he 's unsure of.  |p99After  supper , when the last of the children were in bed and Dorkis and Tuka were cleaning up the mess and sipping wine and talking , he patting her fanny from time to time , sometimes laughing till he wept  --  Tuka was in top form  --  I sat at the edge of the lake with Iona . Except for the stars and the flickering light from the hut behind us , the world seemed empty , abandoned , as if plague-struck . There might have been no Sparta , no Lykourgos , even no Athens , only the immense , studded sky , the hills , the water , the curve of Iona 's arm . The lake was perfectly still , as smooth as black marble . I felt safe , as if time had stopped forever . Also , I felt hungry for Iona , or for something more , a new life , peace . She said , " Did Dorkis tell you what he 's considering ? " Her voice was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which ? " " You know . " Then : " The assassination . " " It 's a bad idea . " My voice , in my own ears , was donkeyish . It had a quaver and my body felt callow . " He told you , then ? " I nodded . " Why is it a bad idea ? " " It just is . " Because I 'm a coward , I should have said . " Some ideas are just bad . There 's no explanation , they just are . " " Ridiculous ! " She laughed , her amusement breaking over the frown , not quite ending the frown but transforming it , deepening t he dimple . " Maybe so , " I said . She went on smiling , thinking , then lay back in the grass , put lice hands behind her head , and pursed her lips . " I know why you say it 's a bad idea . " Her flat voice again , businesslike . " The t ruth is , you do n't want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant . Of course he does . " It was a lie , in fact . Nothing was of interest but her mouth and the line of her hip , the shattering sweetness of her voice . I listened to the crickets , my heart tripping rapidly and lightly , as if I were standing looking down from the roof of a tower . The water lapped at the shore , very quietly . " You 'd give up anything , anybody , for an interesting idea , even a monstrous one like his . " Her voice was half serious , half mock/ing . Coming straight at you ( except with questions ) was Iona 's last resort . " An idea or an adventure , " I said . She lay still , looking at the stars . I could feel her baffled annoyance , and it pleased me . At last , with a brief , ironic smile , she said , " All right , smart one , explain . " " It 's nothing , " I said , still mysteriously uneasy but also tingling with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . Ghost of my youthful metaphysics . What is the ultimate reality ? Adventuresand ideas . An adventure is when someone pokes you in the mouth . An idea is when you think pokedness . " " You ca n't believe that 's what life 's like ! " She was indignant , smiling and scoffing at once , and probably aware that her indignationwas sexy . " I do believe it . So does Dorkis . That 's what he means when he talks about riding reality like a bird . " She turned her head to look at me . " Only part of him believes that . " Her eyes were dead serious now , though the look was still gentle . " What 's best in him makes adventures out of ideas . Such as killing Lykourgos . " That was sharp , I thought . Foolishly , I had n't expected it . I should have guessed that her half jokes , her dimple-flashing ironies were n't all she had , were the ambiance , say , around something she knew for sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wished I 'd brought the wine . " So people can change reality , " I said . " Of course they can , " she snapped , then knew she 'd been made fun of . She turned her face away . After a while she said , like a sigh , " You really are serious , somewhere behind all those masks . It would be interesting to know sometime what you really think . " " So I 'll tell you , " I said , and smiled , boyishly world-weary , wondering what I 'd make up . She slid her eyes at me . She was thinking about it too . The new beginning . Peace like the night around us . I looked at the stars . " All talk between men and women is a prelude to sex , " I said . " You 're aware of that ? " " That 's really dumb , " she said . Smile with dimple . " Right . " But I said , " Because adventures do n't begin in ideas ,  |p101they  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuka do n't think of making love , they merely think as far as clearing the table , separating themselves from you and me , setting up the potential for a new reality  --  a new adventure . When it 's happened t hcy 'll realize what 's happened , that is , they 'll crystallize the event to an idea , which will signal that it 's over . An idea is the conceptualizationof a reality which no longer exists . " " Boy , " she said . But smiled . After a long time , which I foolishly imagined she 'd been using to brood on my theory , she asked , " Do you think they 're making love ? " It was one of those straight-at-you questions that made a lie , a joke , impossible , made all my normally devious ways seem shameful . " Would it bother you ? " " I 'm not sure . " The tone was so straight , so nakedly trusting , it unnerved me like the whisper of a god . Also , it filled me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . It was n't what I 'd meant to say . I leaned on my arm beside her and , after . I 'd thought about it , closed my hand on her breast . The effect shook me to my roots , hurled me back into the innocence of childhood . The softnessof her flesh was like a sudden bursting of wells in a desert , like sympathy , kindness , and understanding I 'd forgotten I deserved . It was as if all I 'd been when I was good , when I was young , had lain in moldering disuse until that instant . All the tension I 'd hardly known I felt came unwound . I was clean . She searched my face , knew everything in it . " Do n't , " she said gently . I kissed her and she put her arm around me , kissing me back . It was all overpowering  --  her very breathing slaughtered my ears  - -  vet with a piece of my mind I did n't believe it , quite ; no more than I really believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered somewhere in these hills . She was a good lover , a woman who knew how to play to men . The suspicion made the night terrible . " I love you , " I said . It sounded to me more convincing , and far more dangerous , than most of the things I said in those days . Other girls I 'd made love to I had n't lied to . Then what madep102me say it ? Panic seized me . Did I not love Tuka , then ? I could n't remember . I drew away from her abruptly to look at the water and think . I ached . My groin was as charged as the bottom of the sea and my chest was like wind in a cave . I knew , beyond any shadow of a doubt , I could abandon everything I had in one moment , without remorse , for the taste of Iona 's mouth , for her walk , her voice , her breast in my cupped hand . Presumably in six months I could drop Iona for somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outraged .  --  Did she love me at all ? I wondered then , in fresh panic . The whole world was dead and putrefact . Seeing that I remained still as a rock , Iona sat up and touched her face to her drawn-up knees and slightly shook her head . " I ca n't believe this is me , " she said . It sounded honest . I looked at her as coldly and objectively as possible . She was lovely and gentle , and I was swayed again . The night was as vast and deep as the cavern of childhood . The fact , sure as the huge rocks that waited below the unrippled lake , was that I was going to make love to her , that she too was hollow with desire . Just the same , I tried to think . It was true that she was beautiful , and it was true that " by a certain system of morality , " as Lykourgos would say , she was good . She 'd been a loving and faithful wife to Dorkis all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her telling me , without any evidence whatever , or none of the kind mere scientists understand . Yet like me , perhaps , she was toying in the back of her mind with throwing all she had been away . It was a thought that , once entertained for an instant , could never be dismissed . She would live the rest of her life knowing that loyalties are moment-to-moment things , even those one clings to till one dies . Or was she toying with me ? I was horrified anew at the violence of my feeling for her . It shook my world like the wrath of Poseidon and left nothing familiar , nothing even recognizable . Why should I be in Sparta ? My whole life was meaningless . I was free . Also caught . It was n't her body I wanted , or not just that . I wanted her . " You 've had an adventure , " I said.  | " God save me from more ! " She laughed , but she seemed troubled . Was it true , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lifted her face from her knees to squint at the water , then smiled suddenly , as if she 'd decided to . It was one of many momentswith her when I saw in amazement how powerfully she could clamp down on her emotions with her mind . Unless , of course , she 'd faked the emotions . " Now I 'll tell you what I think , " she said . She spoke too loudly , as if the kiss were far behind us , the foolishness of youth . " I think Dorkis takes too shortsighted a view . What we need is full-scale revolution . " " Oh , right ! " I said . I wondered briefly if she 'd ever seen a field of corpses , and I sensed , more than thought of , some vague connectionbetween revolution and desiring a good friend 's wife . " It 's possible , Agathon , " she said , " and moral . " " Certainly . " I added , " Moral , anyway . " " Possible , too . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't notice . " She put her hand on mine . Again the excitement and doubt . " We could burn them out  --  every storehouse , every field and vineyard  --  plug the sewage ditches , poison the water with carcasses , wreck their houses . Let 's see what the mighty wasps eat when their drones stop work . " " They could eat Helots , " I said . " Reprisals . Ten for one . " I laughed and moved my hand around her back . " I wonder what Spartans taste like , " she said . " Stringy and tough , I imagine . Something like baboon . " " We could plow their city to salt , " she said . The idea was takinghold . Or the vision . Whatever . She lay back , rolling toward me a little , on my arm . It was as if she was testing me . " You 're untrained , " I said . " You have n't got a chance . " " That 's what justifies atrocities on our side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head , squeezing my eyes shut . " You better go through that again . " " It 's true , " she said , hardening to the thought and moving to/ward me more . " If ten commit atrocities against two , the crime 's far worse than if two commit atrocities against ten for the sake of revenge . " " I 'll work on that . " " Will you help ? " she asked . " Iona , love  --  " I looked at her and saw she meant it , meant it with all her heart , at least for the moment . Mainly , though , I saw her mouth . I laughed in alarm . " We 'd better get back to the hut . " Her hand closed hard on my wrist . " Agathon , we need you . " Overtones rang around her words like rings from a buoy . She made me feel , more than I 'd felt for a long time , manly , stronger than Herakles , beyond all mortal or divine intimidation . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea crying out to the land . Because the Helots were n't men ? Big-muscled Dorkis not a man ? I was n't thinking all this . My mind was inside it , like a building standing in a wind . It was as if for an instant we 'd fallen back to the first hour , archetypal woman clawing up from her castrated mate to the new male . But was I less eunuch in my own secret bed ? My mind struggled clumsily , drowning in the primal scent , straining toward logic , genesis-old defense , desperate and needful as the myth that no Helot can fight . All this in one brief pang of sensation . Damn her , did she love me or not ? " I can hear the historians now , " I said . " The leader of the Helots , infatuated with an Athenian visitor and wishing to devise some means of seeing him frequently without rousing the suspicionsof their respective spouses , conceived the plan of organizinga revolution . But on learning , later  --  " " Stop that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't start because some dumb female . . . " She let it trail off , maybe concentrating on the movement of my hand on her back . She grinned . " Now I have to do it . You 've given me a reason . " She drew away , sat up , fixed her hair . " Tell me one thing , " I said , watching her . The moment had passed . I could feel it yawning away , and I was filled with anguish . " Did you just now make all that up on the spot  --  the revolutionbusiness ? Or is it something you 've been working on ? " Light , flip . But I was drowning.  | " On the spot , " she said , mock-innocent . " Would I spend days on such a morbid idea ? " " It 's pretty clever . If the Helots were n't people I cared about , I 'd advise them to give it a try . " " You think we wo n't , do n't you ? That 's really dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most things people do is mere stubbornness  --  a sort of proof to themselves that they exist . " " Boy , that 's really dumb , " she said again . " Believing the things you do , how come you do n't kill yourself ? " " I do , " I said . " Second by second . " She smiled wryly , shaking her head so that the hair she 'd just gotten neat flew out . " I 'm beginning to understand you . You 're on some drug . " I stood up and gave her my hand . When she was standing I closed my arms around her and kissed her , pulling her body tight to mine . But the moment had passed ; I believed in neither of us . After a time she pulled her mouth away and kissed my shoulder . " I really do n't believe this , " she said . " This ca n't be me . " In the aerie , Tuka was lying naked on the bed . Dorkis was out somewhere , walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I listened to Iona undressing beyond the screen and looked at Tuka . My mind could n't separate them . She was beautiful , white as old stone by moonlight . It filled me with self-hate  --  sexual desireand impotence of soul . Tuka said , " Agathon , we really have to talk about all this . Not tonight , but sometime . " I laughed . I undressed and made rough love to her . When she climaxed she growled , for the benefit of Iona . After that I lay awake for a long time , listening , sweating and remorseful , for Spartan boys with daggers . I heard Dorkis pass in front of the hut , then behind it . He too , it came to me , was expecting Spartans . That was why he 'd come . When I got up and crept to the door to look out , he was hunkering in the shadow of a rock pile , a little up the hill , behind the hut . His bow lay on the rocks beside him ; his knife lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again : This is it . I woke up in bright sunlight . Dorkis was already up , beaming ,  |p106getting  our breakfast ready . His thought of fleeing Sparta , killing Lykourgos , all the rest , seemed to have evaporated . I watched his huge , muscular arms , his wide hairy chest , and wondered if he 'd had my wife . He 'd had his , I knew . She looked pummeled to limpness , and joyful . She blew me a kiss as she came from behind the screen . " How 's the revolution ? " I said . " Oh , that was yesterday ! " She laughed . Tuka said later , " I do n't understand them . They laugh and screw around and drink , and the soldiers kill them off like mice . ' What 's the matter with them ? " " Second by second , " I said . " One hour at a time . " She looked at her hands . " He really was good , you know . " She shot a glance at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 'd slept with him , though she could have . He was tentative , impotent for all his fondling ( or so she decided ) , and in the end he was embarrassed . She thought it was funny . Tuka has a curious mind.  |p107Peeker  : The tall ephor was here again . I 'm more convinced than ever of his honest concern . It 's all very well for idealists to howl that Sparta 's rotten to the core , as my master does , but the fact remains , it 's the greatest city in the whole world , not only because of its size and beauty and natural wealth  --  the fertile plains stretching out all around it  --  and not only because of its army either , but also because of , so to speak , its vision . No place is perfect  --  anyone knows that  --  but where except Sparta have kings and commoners united behind the ideals Equality and Justice , and fought with all their might against corrupting forces like wealth and laziness ? You 'll notice the god does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does places like Pylos and Methone . I 've heard about the seaport plague from people that have seen it , and it 's something . It starts with fainting and stomach trouble , and then fever develops and terrible , terrible pain . It comes and goes in waves . You think you 're getting better and suddenly it 's worse than before and at last it kills you . ( " That 's life , " my mastersays . ) Anyway , we do n't get such things here in Sparta . My father fought and died for Sparta , even though he was a Helot . I think I 'd do the same . Lykourgos 's vision 's not achieved yet , true , and it 's true that some of his methods are questionable . Nevertheless , it 's a great experiment  --  as Agathon says in his mocking voice . And however bad a few Spartans here and there may be , there are still men like the tall ephor , devoted to makingp108the vision into reality . I feel as if I 've been blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man , I still say that , for all his boring self-centeredness ; and men like him served a purpose once : no matter how faithful to his vision a man like Lykourgos may be , he can always use a critic . Lykourgos must have known that all along . If he were here in Sparta , Agathon would be free in a minute , putrid old husk though he is . Still , I look at the tall ephor , standing erect and mild at the door , asking in his dignified soft-spoken way about Agathon 's health , inquiring whether something might not be done about the rats ( there are always rats in prison ; getting rid of them for good would take a god 's intervention ) , and then I look over at Agathon , sitting on his bed with his skirt above his knees and his pupils rolled up and that leer on his face , and I feel as if scales have fallen from my eyes . While the ephor was quietly , determinedly working for the power that sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sooner or later make Sparta the moral torch for the whole world , where was Agathon ? I was there : I can tell you . He was sneaking up alleys to peek through windows at people making love . He was shinnying up columns and whisperingback at me , " Peeker ! Peeker ! The jug ! " he was sitting on his ass in the onion patch , peeling onions with his dirty thumbs and crying  --  " for all mankind , " he said . Or he was strutting with the soldiers , making fools of them , or mimicking feeble King Kharilaus , so that no one afterward who looked at the king could feel any proper respect for his position . You call that healthy ? " If you do n't want to be criticized , do n't criticize , " my mother says . He brought the whole thing on himself . I do n't mean I abandon him . He 's a sort of national monument , you might say , but just the same .. . I told the ephor everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been driven out of his mind by women , how that gave him compassion for everyone and everything and made him see through everything the way a lover sees through both himself and his love but forgives himself and forgives the love and goes on and on in his hopeless pursuit , and how , also , the same things that turned him into a Seer are the causes of his looks and actions  --  his ungodly singing , for instance , things like :  |p109Nobody  loves a drunkardand nobody loves a whore , but nobody loves Their Majesties more ! Much more , oh , nobody loves Their Majesties more ! " What does that mean , exactly ? " the ephor said . " Who knows ? " I said . Or his peeking through windows , for instance , not because he 's really got a dirty mind but because seeing people in love , especiallyugly people , old people , or best of all cripples , fills his heart with joy . But people get the wrong idea , I said . Once late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to hide in some azalea bushes , and it was holy to him  --  the human spirit 's struggle to keep its baseness private  --  and he could n't contain himself ; he went right up to her shoulder and whispered , " God bless you ! " The old lady was mad as hell , and she started throwingstones at us . I understood , but how could you ask some ignorant old Spartan lady to comprehend a thing like that ? We ran , Agathon giggling and vaulting along on his crutch , and people came to the doors in their loincloths and saw the old lady throwing stones and screaming , and they grabbed some stones and joined in with her . I did n't blame them , I could see their point of view ; he looked like any other old drunk to them . But I could understand Agathon 's side too , not that I was n't ashamed , of course . In fact , when he was n't looking I lobbed a stone at him myself . It clipped him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a vision of the gap between ideal and real , a thing nobody but a lover could understand . The ephor looked steadily over my head , not showing anything because of course he had to judge these things impartially . " Was this incident recent ? " he said . I told him about the time he caused that uproar in the bullring . One minute he 's sitting beside me in the stands , banging his crutch from time to time , the way he does when he 's a little cross , and the next minute he 's down there in the ring , holding this stupid little square of cloth that he uses for his nose , holding it up like a bullfighter 's cape . The bull comes at him and plows rightp110through him . I had to nurse him for six months . " What in hell did you prove ? " I howl at him when he 's able to talk . " That bulls are smarter than people , " he says . I 'd like to have killed him  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover , he lives his whole life by trickery and deceit , and he ca n't stand it . Any fool can see the poor bull 's got no chance , the whole thing 's rigged . So Agathon has to show how things really are . He ca n't stop himself . I admire him for it , up to a point . But naturally people do n't understand . They think it 's political , they think he 's making fun of Spartan courage . The ephor said , " The bullfight was part of a religious festival ? " I was glad he asked it right out . " Yes . But Agathon 's deeply devoted to the gods , in his way . It was n't that . " He looked over my head , weighing it . The ephors standing a little behind him looked uneasy , the fat one smiling nervously , wringing his hands , the stolid one looking at the ground . They were sweating rivers from hurrying to keep up with the tall one 's stride and then standing all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop or two over his eyebrows . I said , " Whatever the charges against him are , I can prove they 're all lies . He 's got a lot of enemies , but I 've been following him for three years and I can guarantee you he never did anything illegal . Especially , he 's got political enemies . But he loves this city . He worked with politicians for years . If you investigate  --  " The ephor 's eyes dropped down from over my head to meet mine , and he was listening more closely than ever . " If you investigate , you 'll find his accusers are the enemies of the state . " " A full investigation may well be necessary , " the ephor said . He meant it , and he would see to it . He tried to talk then to Agathon , but the old man was hopeless . After they 'd left I asked Agathon what he thought . He rolled the pupils back down into sight , then closed his eyes and rubbed the lids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Pecker , my boy , I 've been rethinking the philosophical positions of my youth . " I had a feeling he was at it again , but I waited , hoping against hope.  | " It 's recently struck me that the fundamental material of the world is not earth or fire or water or even air , as people like Thales maintain , but wind . " I sighed . " The precise distinction between wind and air is not yet perfectly clear to me , but I 'm working on it ; and in any case , as I used to tell Tuka , what matters in natural philosophy is not so much what is true as what is interesting . " He puckered up his lips . " Wind I tentatively define as the Poseidonic essence : that which moves whatever moves ( as for example , air , water , fire , or earth ) . The implications are staggering , my boy . " " I bet , " I said . " Movement can only be perceived within time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) there can be nothing . I am forced to conclude , reluctantly , that time is space . Or to convert the terms , matter is the breath of God for a certain span of time . I am of course perfectly aware that all this is absolute rubbish , but I tolerate that . It takes care of Zeno 's arrow , anyway . So it comes to this : Every event , every adventure , is a ripple in God 's exhalation . Or should I say His fart ? Maybe Solon from one end , Lykourgosfrom the other . He he he ! " I did not choose to comment . He told a story.  |p112Agathon  : I have just made up a marvelous story that , if Peeker 's credulity does not fail me , will go down through History : It is said that Solon , when he was old , once visited Kroesos at Sardis . They say that when he went into Kroesos 's palace he was like an inland man when he first goes to see the ocean . As the inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , so Solon , passing through Kroesos 's court and seeing a great many nobles in rich attire and surrounded by attendants , supposed every nobleman he met must be the king . When he came to Kroesos , who was seated , so fat he could n't move a finger , high on a throne of gold and ivory and silver , gloriously decked with every possible rarity and spangle , in ornaments of jewels , purple , gold , scarlet , and surrounded by an army of terra-cotta statues , he seemed not especially impressed and , in fact , failed to give King Kroesos the compliments he expected . Kroesos commanded his men to open all his treasure houses and take Solon to look at his sumptuous furniture and luxuries  --  his superb black-figure jugs , cups , bowls , his perfume flasks and ivories , seraboidal seal amulets with pictures of sphinxes , his seal stones , carpets , Phoenikianjewelry , Skythian carvings , Phrygian figures , his fine painted chariots , horses , ibexes , lions . When Solon came back from viewingthe treasures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an earthquake from all that exertion , Kroesos asked him if ever he had known a happier man than he . Solon , after he 'd got his wind , stretched his cheeks with his fingertipsp113and pursed his lips and finally answered , softly and gently , that he 'd known a man named Tellos once , a fellow citizen of his , and he told the king that this Tellos had been an honest man , had had good children and a competent estate , and had died bravely in battle for his country . Kroesos , staring down from his seven hundred pounds like an angry whale , took him for an ill-bred fool , but he kept his temper and asked if he knew , besides Tellos , any other man more happy than himself . Solon nodded like an Indian sage . " Two , " he said . " Kloebis and Biton . They were loving brothers , and extremely dutiful sons to their mother . One famous day when the oxen delayed her , they hitched themselves to the wagon and drew her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed to have such sons , and she agreed that it was so . Later , after the sacrifice and feast , they went to their beds and rose no more . They died in the midst of their honor a painless and tranquil death . We named a road for them . " Kroesos was furious . " Look here , " he said , " do you figure we 're not among the happy men at all ? " Solon , unwilling to exasperate him more , replied with great and gentle formality : " The gods , 0 king , have given the Greeks all other gifts in moderate degree ; and so our wisdom , too , is cheerfuland homely , not kingly wisdom . Our humble understanding , observing the numerous misfortunes that attend upon all conditions , forbids us to grow overconfident of our present enjoyments , or to admire any man 's happiness that may yet , in the course of time , suffer alteration . To salute as happy a man who is still in the midst of life 's hazard we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ring . " After this , he was dismissed , having given Kroesos some pain but not much instruction , as it seemed to Kroesos . Aesop , the man who writes the fables , was in Sardis at the time on Kroesos 's invitation  --  an old friend of Solon 's  --  and he was troubled that Solon was so ill received as a result of his own mulishness . " Solon , " said he , " when a man gives advice to kings he should make it pert and seasonable . " Solon nodded as if abashed and said softly , feebly , for he was well up in years : " Or short and reasonable . Or curt and treasonable . Or tart and please-him-able. "  |p114Aeso|p  sighed . Though a person of the greatest sobriety , he was always unmanned by a jest . Why I made the story up I 'm not exactly sure , except that it has of course things to do with my demon Lykourgos . Has to do with Time and Scorn . Solon  --  realist , pragmatist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute , like a god 's . ( " Moderationin all things including moderation , " Dorkis used to say . ) Solon babbles , filling the air and suffocating his enemies with " humble wisdom " or else comforting noise ; Lykourgos hardly speaks and , when he does , speaks in aphorisms or rebukes as quick and short as Spartan daggers or , say , thunderbolts . Solon , in his prime , would fall in love with ten women and five or six boys a year ; Lykourgos turns women into men . His marriage laws , for instance . He 's set it up so that the husband carries his bride off by a sort of force . The woman who supervises the wedding clips the bride 's hair off close around her head and dresses her up in man 's clothes and leaves her on a mattress in the dark . The bridegroom comes in in his everyday clothes , unties her virgin zone , and takes her . When he 's finished he returns to his own dormitory , to sleep as usual with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , year after year , so that sometimes a man may have several children before he has ever seen his wife 's face by daylight . If a man falls in love with another man 's wife  --  which happens fairly often where women walk naked  --  the law allows him to ask the husband for her company ; and it forbids the husband to refuse him except if the lover or the wife is sickly or a weakling . Lykourgos goes further . He orders that children not be begotten by the first corner but by the best man that can be found . I suggested to him once that the law was perhaps a little inhuman . " The reverse , " he said . " Is it human to breed better horses and cows than men ? " When a child is born , they carry it to the judges , and if the child looks sickly , they kill it , throw it from a cliff as they would a runt pig . He was baffled when Solon repealed all Draco 's laws . We were alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his servant , the boy who put his eye out . According to Solon , the laws were too severe , the punishments too great . Lykourgos quoted me Draco 's own comment on why nearly all crimes werep115punishable by death : " Even small crimes deserve death , " he said . " As for greater crimes , well , death is the worst I 've got . " Lykourgossat with his chin pulled in , gloomy and distant . His rabbinical nose commanded the room like a battlement against a night sky . " But why ? " I said . It was in the days when I still tried to reason with him . " Why death for , say , loitering ? " " It purifies the blood , " he said . " That 's the beginning and end of Law and Order . " " The blood . " I pretended to muse on it . " The blood of the State , " he said . His voice was flat as iron . " The criminal nature is a product of bad breeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course ! " I said . " You mean people like our friend here , Alkander . " Lykourgos winced . Just a flick of one eyelid . He loves his bodyguard , insofar as a man of ice-cold marble can love anything merely mortal . " You 're clever , Agathon . An incisive mind . " He always judged my sallies dispassionately , indifferently . I told him of Solon 's jurors . It was a plan he 'd worked out before he became arkhon , and I knew the theory of it . I had it in my book . In a counterfeit bid for the support of the rich , Solon refused the poorest class in Athens  --  the Thetes or hill people  --  any place in the public assembly , but he let them he jurors . The Thetes were very cross at first , but in time they found out that they 'd won a great advantage . Nearly every dispute that came up in Athens would sooner or later come to them . Even in cases he assigned to the arkhon , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was careful to word his laws in a way that was obscure and ambiguous , so that the power of his jurors would balance the power of the rest . Lykourgos scowled at me , thinking it over . " Where inequality exists , Justice is impossible . " He was crosser than usual . He had a headache . " True , " I said . " But when a rich man 's treated unjustly , he has his wine cellar to fall back on . A poor man has only his ass . " He closed his one eye and pressed his fingertips to it as if to console it . " Clever but not to the point , " he said.  | " This then , " I said . I leaned toward him  --  sitting opposite him , six feet away . Alkander watched me with his arms folded . " To get rid of inequality you have to change man 's nature  --  in fact , deny the structure of the universe . It can be done . You 're proving it . But some would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no position  --  somewould say your option 's barbaric , even stupid . If laws are to deal with men as they are and reality as it is , they have to provide for unequal men in a world of flux . Say the State is , as the poets say , a ship . If you want to keep it exactly what it is , you have two choices . Either you patch it day by day , replace worn-out boards , reweave old sails , repaint it with tar , or you haul it up onto some smooth stones and carefully protect it from all use , even the weather 's . " " Men as they are are not worth building a State for , " he said . " Common minds have believed too long that whatever is is necessary . The time has come for a higher belief . " " Bullshit ! " I exploded . " What would you know about common minds , or any other kind of human mind , Lykourgos ? " His head shot forward , hands braced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bullshit ! " He was enraged , and it was n't abstract now . I had blundered onto his heart , and I had nicked it . His jaw worked and his voice had all hell in it . " Agathon , " he bellowed , " I have known the affections of a woman . " " Never , " I said . I snapped it like a whip . " She faked it ! " He was out of his chair and coming at me , and then Alkander was on him , holding him , yelling at me over his shoulder , " Go ! Get out of here ! 11laniac ! " But I hung on one second longer . " Your brother 's queen , " I said , and laughed . " How stupid of us all ! " Alkander let him go , willing to see me dead for that . But Lykourgossank to the floor , clenching his fists and moaning , helpless , on fire with self-hate and hatred for me . Alkander knelt by him , touching his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . He paces rapidly , stiff-legged , his chin lifted , moving across the room and back , again and again , exactly like a tiger . It would n't be easy for Lykourgos to forgive me for that dis/covery , I knew . But the next time I saw him he was calm , stern , and distant , as always . " Nothing in the world is knowable , " he said . " Knowledge is unflinching assertion . " " I assert , then , that a man still wants to know . " And then , recklessly , with a glance at Alkander : " Perhaps , in fact , she loved you. , , " Perhaps the eagles love me , or the gods . " It 's a terrible thing to hear Lykourgos laugh.  |p118Peeker  : We found one of our rats dead this morning . Some disease . Agathonturned it over and over , thinking , saying nothing . It makes me uneasy.  |p119Agathon  : Dorkis and Iona were of course not the only people we ever saw in Sparta . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or went with to things like the festivals of Orthia and Orestes or , when autumn came , the bullfights . One can hardly help havingfriends in a vast and sprawling city , even a reactionary city like this one . A hermetic soul may get by well enough in the mountains , with no one to talk to but his god ; but here the sheer press of population is against it  --  and more : the nature of the population . At festival time , or during the games , mankind stands thick as a field of wheat , a mixed and mingled half-breed or manybreedhumanity that by its diverse character threatens all that any one man may stand for . The Spartans , first . Naked as tombstonesexcept for their crude iron neck rings and bracelets . Fierce , austere people who laugh at no joke more than six words long , who breed by contract and kill non-Spartans as casually as they 'd kill a horse with spavins . Then there were Egyptians and Sardinians , immodestly dressed , by comparison , in toe-length robes and jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , as casually as Athenians drink wine . Then Greeks of the Perioikoi , born of every Hellenic city , some puritanical as Homer himself , some more licentious than Sardinians . Then Helots , the humble majority , weighed down like donkeys , some of them , and others  --  like Dorkis and Iona  --  gilded like Mesopotamian gods . What is a man to make of himself , or of his father 's codes , in such confusion ? In Athens , the sexual code ( for instance ) was simple . Ap120man should be faithful , and if he could n't  --  and many could n't  --  he should view his breach with reasonable shame . If he slept with a slavegirl , and everyone did , he should dislike himself for forcing upon her the shame of prostitution . ( In Sparta , the rape of a Helot was called an act of patriotism . In Sardis it was called a snack . ) Who could survive , in such a city , except by supporting what was best in himself  --  or whatever was worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleight-of-hand of friendship , the buttress of some similar nature , bad or good ? Some of our friends  --  the friends of whom Tuka was usually fondest  --  were rich fellow expatriates from Athens . These , in general , did n't get on very well with Dorkis and Iona , mainly becauseof Dorkis 's way of fondling women , I suspect . He petted them in public , but in the dark he was stubbornly loyal to his wife . The Athenians were , in public , more discreet . I was not , in general , fond of Athenians in Sparta . I can toleratewatching a bull murdered with one man as well as with the next . It 's better , I suppose , than the old Minoan cult in which the god-bull was always victorious , his victims mere children . And when festival drinking and dancing get thoroughly out of hand , I can sneak off with one man 's wife as well as with another 's . Nevertheless , there were few Athenians in Sparta who were n't fat parasites , men whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned to genteel outlaws  --  heavily moustached , scented , oil-bathed , weighted with semiprecious stones . They were cultured , some of them even refined  --  when Tuka played her harp they knew what to praise  --  but I am not , myself , as amused as I might be by culture and refinement . The crudest men I have ever known were gawky old Klinias , my beloved master , and Solon , my beloved employer , whom some poet once called " The Father of Athens and Mother of All the Hogs . " We lived what is known as a rich life , badly hung-over three mornings out of five , hiding our heads from the sunlight in rooms draped with purple cloth and thickly padded with Oriental rugs , so that no sandal 's click might cleave our skulls . We were sealed off from the ordinary work of the world , and virtually sealed off from our children too , except when we made a point of seeing them , Tuka instructing Diana on the harp , I struggling to makep121poor Kleon a horseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admired in him on all other occasions , and intolerantof his fear 's beclouding of his mind . I was , myself , a man absolutely without fear on a horse . Though I 'm a gentle person , in most respects , I have ridden horses men swore were bewitched ; bedeviled , mad creatures that I think would as soon have eaten me as borne me . A week after my brother 's funeral I rode the chicken-brained stallion that killed him . Later , on a winter rabbit hunt , I rode that same horse to his grave .  --  In any case , Kleon was afraid of the plodding brown mare I 'd given him  --  a lovely horse dark as a roasted chestnut  --  and for reasons too shadowy for me to fathom , I was beside myself . I would shout at him , calling him stupid , brainless , and when Kleon wept , struggling to do what I demanded  --  think clearly  --  I would clench my teeth and swear . " I 'm scared , " he would say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , clinging to the horse 's neck . I would reason with him , tense with anger , explaining to him what fun he would have with the other boys if he learned to ride , explaining to him how ashamed he was ( and it was true ) when friends younger than himself  --  a boy named Markapor , for instance  --  went casually thundering off . " Please , please , please , Daddy . Please ! " he would wail , and at last I would say , " Get off then , damn you , and walk , " and I would ride off . I would talk to him later , telling him that what I had done was inexcusable , even though his fear was , of course , annoyingand frustrating . I had never treated anyone that way until now  --  and I did this kind of thing more than once , turning the whole force of my rage on a child . And yet I loved him more than I 'd ever loved anyone else . Were Tuka 's rages at Kleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tuka hit Kleon in the stomach once  --  he 'd broken something that belonged to her , and destruction , the world 's mutability really , was intolerable to Tuka . She hit him  --  not a slap but an angry punch with her fist  --  and I jumped to her , caught her shoulder , and slapped her face so hard she went flying across the room . ( I was n't angry then . I was collected but outraged . I slapped her as I would have spanked Kleon for throwing a stone at Diana . ) " Do n't ever do that again , " I said . Righteous , true ; righteous as a drunken god . But she never tried it again , at least in my presence . Tuka would reach the samep122frustration I reached with Kleon when she worked with Diana at the harp . Diana did n't want to play the harp , she said . I insisted that she must . It 's hard , in the beginning , I told her ; everything you try you fail at . But it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We knew that for a fact , Tuka and I , though Diana could n't , and so we asserted the natural right of superior knowledge and forced her . Diana wept , letting her hands fall away from the strings , and Tuka would shriek at her , and Diana would lift her hands and play again , weeping . Unlike Kleon  --  he may never learn to ride a horse , though he knows all the secrets of my grammata  --  Diana learned quickly , and soon she was playing with sheepish pride for friends . But except for the time we righteously set aside for their instruction , or for play with them  --  somewhat better times than the times of instruction , but also less frequent  --  we saw very little of our children . We had various circles : some friends we " sat up with , " as Tuka put it , meaning that I talked philosophy or politics with the husband while Tuka gossiped with the wife ; other friends with whom , as she put it , we cavorted . With a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter . I must reluctantly set down some facts . First , though no one would believe it who has seen me ranting in the Spartan hills in my later years , winking and sneering and spelling dark spells , prophesying plagues and trepidations of the earth and stars , my hair flying wildly , my eyes like a frog 's , my arms stretched out as Lykourgos stretches his , forming with the fingers of each hand V 's for Victory , I was once a handsome and sweetly poetic young man . Weak-chinned , admittedly , and given to grand pontifications , but lovable , all in all . I was , moreover , an ambitious person , but ambitious in ways still uncertain , undirected . I 'd taken a few students and was gaining a reputation of sorts ; but my heart was n't in it . I was employed off and on by Lykourgosand the ephors , sometimes as a sort of informal adviser , sometimes ( by Lykourgos , not the ephors ) as an envoy in delicate matters where messages transmitted or discussions held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was , in effect , a high-class odd-jobs man with a company horse ; I was the voice of all things tentative or tendentious . " Do so-and-so , " I was in/structed to say , " or , between you and me , Sparta will have  --  in my personal opinion  --  no possible course but war . " It was stupidwork , though at times dead serious . Those I talked to  --  after the endless preliminaries ( the boat ride , the tour , the entertainmentby the poet-harper and his acrobats )  --  those I talked to understood as well as I did that we were playing a perhaps meaninglessgame : the ephors do all official diplomatic work for Sparta . Even the kings have no final say in foreign affairs , except as generals in war . Yet I 'd been sent at state expense , with the seal of Lykourgos on my introduction , which meant that somethingmight conceivably he possible , a meeting with the ephors in the future , perhaps , or some secret , gentleman 's agreement ; and on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , they were talking with me , so the game we were playing might at any moment turn earnest . There was a further complication . At the heart of the game , we all knew , lay one question : would Sparta 's role in and around Lakonia be defensive or aggressive ? The ephors favored aggression  --  extend the borders and establish a buffer of subject city-states . Lykourgos favored a defensive , isolationistposture . One meant immoral imperialism , an extension of suppression like that which had already deracinated all Helot pride ; the other would produce a city of warriors , state-supported killers , spoiling like overtrained watchdogs for a fight . They would have no choice but to occupy their time as warriors do , fighting one another or murdering scapegoats , some passing Helot drudge . I 'd have chosen neither , if that choice were possible ; but Sparta has always been the plum , with her wheat and cattle and beautifulhills of olive trees and vineyards  --  a city the gods created to entertain them with endless invasions . So I favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally bound to it hand and foot , in fact , as Lykourgos understood . Why else would he send his most obstinate critic , " pet democrat , " as he used to say , on missionsaimed at thwarting the will of the ephors and imposing his own despotic will ? Not , of course , that I was ever out of sight of his secret police ( but neither were the ephors ) , and not that , if I had made some mistake , he would have troubled to rescue me . Nevertheless , for almost four years the curious partnership of enemies worked . I was born , no doubt , to be caught , my wholep124life long , in double binds . But enough of all that . The game I played with those I met in the cities of the sons of Hellen was a tricky , devious free-for-all , in which Lykourgos , through unofficialagents like myself , worked every city against every other , and all of them against the ephors . Except for allies I could win in the playing , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detested and whose power gave me no sanction . There are doubtless envoys who would have scorned the canescent unrealitiesI manipulated like Sardinian pieces on a playing board , but I have always clowned and mocked , played games , in the hope of discovering the real . While we toyed with fictions , pickingour way through the vague potentialities that littered our path like shadowy rocks and moray eels , my hands and armpits ran with sweat , and my hind end went numb from sitting still to dramatize my indifference . When I returned from these missions , I would , after copying what I 'd gotten for my book ( this was before Klinias 's book arrivedand I began adding to it ) , drink myself to stone for a week , then plunge with renewed vigor into the idiocy of parties , wild night rides through the countryside with friends , or , sometimes , pointless verbal duels with Lykourgos . Invariably , when we went to expatriate Athenian parties , I would deliberately , solemnly get drunk . Occasionally scenes ensued . One night , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by a young Athenian couple we 'd been seeing off and on for a year or two . The man , Hamrah , a man of Egyptian stock and comically proud of his Athenian citizenship , was a black-market king who dealt in Asian ornaments and jewels , especially ivory figurines of gods and goddesses . He was a very tall , stern-minded man who had curiously direct and simple theories . All life , he said , was based on the principle of advertising pressure and response  --  aphrase he 'd picked up from some Phoenikian peddler . That was the basis of his financial success , his perfect understandingof his wife , his success with young ladies of heretofore impeccablemorals , and so forth . I rarely troubled to argue with him . He had a fine sense of humor , at least about everything except himself , and he was an excellent horseman . I could n't afford to be too fussy . There were few enough in Sparta whop125rode as I rode , hell-bent , indifferent to arm or skull . Also , he seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife , unluckily , was a gentle , sensitive girl who could easily be raped ( and eventually was ) by music or poetry , who cared for moment -- to-moment feeling , and whose friendships  --  with Tuka , for instance  --  wereas close and oblivious to purpose as the friendship of the earth and sun . And so , as I was saying , one night we stayed late . For me , the party was murderously dull . Tuka 's wit was , as usual , flashy , but I knew the stories . Hamrah drank heavily , as usual , and as usual showed no sign of drunkenness . He talked with his Athenian friends of the " art of business . " It was characteristic of all of them to abstract real transactions to theory : even among fellow maggots it would have been awkward to talk of what they really sold , or where , or how . They all talked in the same way , holding forth loudly while they had the floor , gazing off into the corners of the room like ill-arranged statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oratory . I listened absently , moving my eyes from group to group , picking up without interest , like shopworn trinkets , bits of their inflated language  --  " customer extinction , " " impetus diffusion "  --  and I drank . On the wide stone terrace openingout toward Hamrah 's large pond , a group of Helot instrumentalistsplayed lugubrious dances , and couples drifted past the open doorway embracing , moving vaguely in time with the music . Hamrah 's wife came with a pitcher to offer more wine . She was small , buxom , with a face like a child 's  --  pretty mouth , a slightly turned up nose , shy eyes . I held up my cup and she filled it . " I 'm Thalia , " she said . " Remember ? " I grinned . " It 's beginning to come back to me . " She laughed , holding off . " Wonderful . " " Come sit , " I said . She glanced around the room . There were plenty of empty wine cups , but there was nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher on the carved center table , came back with her cup , and sat down on the floor beside my cushion . When she 'd arranged herself , feet tucked under her to one side , chiton flowing smoothly over her knees , she looked up , smiling , as if for somep126new command . Since I had none to give , she said with pleasantly childlike irony , " You look like you 're having a wonderful time . " " I 've been listening and learning , " I said solemnly . " Wonderful ! " She looked over at the group around her husband . A short , thick man like a sawed-off column with a black , short beard and eyes large as hen 's eggs was talking about marketseizuremodalities . She looked back at me , serious . " I hear you write poetry . " " At times . I 'm a degenerate . " She drank and thought about it . " Really ? " she asked . I understood all this , of course . The womanly flirtation , the hostessly flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . " Very , very degenerate , " I said . I glanced at her husband , clean cut , erect as a general . " Now Solon 's poetry is something else . It 's public , rhetorical , designed to sway the community to good . But mine  --  " I shook my head in mock despair . " Pure anarchy . If I had any character I 'd burn it . " Thalia lifted her head and laughed , self-conscious but also amused , curious . " Are you serious , Agathon ? " I slid off the cushion , pushed it away , and sat beside her on the floor . Tuka and someone I did n't know drifted past the doorway , dancing . ( " Nice enough , yes , " Tuka was saying . " You know the kind . Sex makes her seasick . " ) " Never more serious in my life , " I said . " All poetry , good or evil , works by the same process . Solon writes good good poetry , I write good evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime . Is it naughty ? " " Alas , no . Aseptic . " She smiled and glanced over at her husband . " What 's the process ?  --  What you were talking about . " " You want the whole lecture ? " She nodded happily . " While we dance . " " Good idea , " I said , " but unluckily  --  " " Oh . " She glanced at my bad leg . " How stupid ! " " How about I lecture while we go for a walk ? " " Wonderful ! " she said . I set down my cup , labored to my feet , and held out my hand . We walked , and I gave her the lecture I used to dazzle students with , about philosophy by exclusion ( logic ) and philosophy byp127inclusion ( poetry ) , and poetry for the common good ( Solon 's ) and poetry for sickly self-congratulation ( mine ) . We ended up sitting in the tall , soft grass by the pond , holding hands . Looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water or the shore was more still . I put my arm around her . Her back was softer than Tuka 's , less sharply cleft at the spine . She told me about her father . Once when he was drunk and she was bringing him home , he tried to push her in front of a carriage team . All her life she 'd been afraid to go to sleep at night . I moved my hand on her back . It was very unusual for her to talk seriously with anyone , she said . She felt like a prisoner sometimes . Life seemed huge when you were sitting out here by the water , looking up at the stars , and it made her feel cheated not to be able to see everything , know everything there was . I thought fleetingly about my old book  --  a thing I rarely mentioned to anyone  --  and moved my hand on the far side of her back , slowly . I was thinking now of Iona . " Will you show me your poetry ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at me I kissed her . She did n't exactly return the kiss , but she did n't pull away either . I said , " Let 's swim . " " Here ? " she said , incredulous . But it was n't the pond 's stagnationshe was thinking of . Quite casually  --  because , though my tongue was glib , I was too drunk for any ghost of inhibition  --  I stripped and dove in . I hit my head on a stump but hardly noticed . The water was warm as soup . After a moment she too was in the water , laughing , calling out to me about the water 's warmth . She swam beautifully , as graceful as an athlete , and after a time I crawled out on the bank to sit and watch her . Blood ran down into my eyes from where I 'd hit myself on the sunken stump . At last she too came out , shyly , her body white in the moonlight  --  hips and breasts far sweeter , it seemed to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat down beside me , shook her hair , and laughed . " Marvelous ! " she said . I put my arm around her , laid her down , and kissed her . Blood fell on her from my banged-up forehead . She was smiling , and whispered , " Marvelous . " It was , but I could do nothing , my body wine-logged . And perhaps something else . Wine does n't usually defeat me at such moments . " We 'd betterp128I 'll go back , " I said . She nodded . After a while , still not speaking , we got up , dressed , and , holding hands , went back up to the house . Hamrah and Tuka sat on the terrace , in the shadow of thecypresses , talking . ( " . . . is , there 's no such thing as a grown-up , " Tuka was saying . " I imagine it 's especially sad to people who are really , really old . " ) Thalia and I went inside , refilled our cups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I slept like a boulder . A week later , Hamrah told me solemnly , his big hands closing and opening around each other , that his marriage was on the rocks because of " what happened the other night . " I was astonished . " Hamrah , " I asked , " do you think I made love to your wife ? " He tipped his head down and rolled up his eyes , full of gloomy guilt . " No , " he said , " but maybe it would have been better if you had , because I did with yours , and now Thalia hates me . " " But that 's absurd ! " I said . His news surprised me , to say the least , partly because it came from such a fine , antiseptic , military-looking man , but I was n't shocked , certainly not wounded . I was partly surprised that Tuka had failed to mention it , and partly I was surprised at Thalia , if what he said was true . I could understand well enough why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was mere chance that we had n't . I remembered what Thalia had said about the hugeness of life and her feeling cheated . I could have laughed , now , but I did n't . " It 's ridiculous , " I said . I sounded to myself like Solon , filling the air with noises while he thought about his next move . " I could have had her , " I said . " I suppose it was stupid of me not to . " He looked mournfullytoward the house , like a warrior surveying the ground of his defeat . Inside , Tuka and Thalia were talking . " I would n't know , " he said . And so that night I went swimming again with Thalia , pristine Athenian girl , and our naked bodies would brush together from time to time and she would raise her arms , reaching for her stroke , so that her breasts moved against my chest , and afterward ( goose pimples rising on my skin , my teeth chattering ) we made love on the bank where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to the house , Tuka and Hamrah were in bed . Hamrah pretendednot to see us at the door . I took Thalia 's hand and led her to the second bedroom . Toward daylight , Tuka came to our bed . All this happened more than once . I understood , well enough ,  |p129that  it was destructive . Hamrah was a good lover ( Tuka told me in great detail ) , and I , as a matter of fact , was far from spectacular in bed , especially with Thalia . Nearly always , in fact , I was impotentwith her , and she would say things like " Agathon , Agathon , what have I done wrong ? Why ca n't you love me ? " and would talk of suicide . Hamrah , meanwhile , would be firm as a rock for hours , mumbling , " Tuka , Tuka , I love you , I love you , " to which Tuka would answer , sensibly , " Do n't be silly , dear , it 's just a friendly fuck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority , I had him cold : I loved his wife better than he did  --  or , anyway , I understood her better than he did , cared more about what she thought . I could offer her pieces of this huge life that Hamrah had never heard of . What had started , between me and Thalia , as a friendly fuck became something else . Though I liked being in bed with her , even when I was impotent , what I liked best was walking and talking with her , telling her about politics and philosophy and poetry , or listening to her stories about her childhood . I wrote poems for her , degenerate , of course . But whatever of the degenerate there may have been in the poems , it was mine , not hers . She was the gentlest girl I 'd ever known . Certainly gentler than Tuka , gentler than Iona . When Tuka was angry she would cut with her tongue , lash out with her fists , at last go rigid with fury . As for Iona , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning that it was a mask . She almost never raised her voice at her children , but once when she was slightly drunk and her second oldest son was screeching , shivering the night with his pointless , now merry , now cantankerous noise , I watched her smash a cup on his skull ( almost without expression ) . Another time , when I stood behind her and bacon grease spattered on her arm  --  no fault of mine  --  she turned and meant to brain me , merely because I was handy , then thought better of it . Thalia , when she was offended , withdrew or wept . The best of them all , perhaps . Yet Thalia never possessed me , body and soul . For her , as for them , I felt tenderness , respect , admiration . Like theirs , her unexpected appearance in a room gave my heart a sudden leap of pleasure and , needless to say , desire . But she was never inside me like an incubus bent on my destruction . It was like the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water spirit as a mask for her deadly courtship . What it was that made the difference I do n't know .  --  In any case , Thalia stopped loving her husband . Tuka , for her part , loved me more than ever , it seemed . She had never been awed by Hamrah 's intellect or his worldly aplomb , and I was a gentler , though not a more robust , bedfellow . But while her nights with Hamrah intensified her love for me , they also had on her an effect she had never expected , though I could have warned her of it . Sometimes when we were talking happily about this or that , her eyes would move away , and I knew she was thinking of him . I was sorry for her , as I was for Hamrah and Thalia , but I said nothing . And so at last , inevitably , Hamrah looked at me in rage and said , " All you 've left me is a piece of ass that wants no piece of me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it was a little inadequate . He lifted his fists , not as if to hit me , as if looking for somethingsomewhere to hit . " Get out of here , " he yelled . " You 're evil . All of you ! Buzz off ! " Tuka cried . We left . Two hours later , Thalia came . Tuka was asleep . We went for a walk and , for the last time , made love . I neglected to mention her visit to Tuka . Thalia told Hamrah , and he was aflame with moral indignation . He ordered her out of the house forever , then changed his mind and ordered her out for a week . ( He took in a girl friend while Thalia was away . A man needs comfort at a time like that . ) She was never to see either one of us again . She came to Tuka to apologize for her sin and weep , and Tuka , aflame with , possibly , moral indignation , raged and swore and ordered poor Thalia from her sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and demanded an explanation . I evaded , then finally made somethingup , heavy , heavy with weariness . Later I told Iona that I had slept with Thalia . She wept . She shook violently , holding me and weeping , as if her pain went into the ground below her feet and made the earth shake . I felt no guilt , felt victimized by other people 's foolishness , or anyway their self-made traps , but it was n't comforting . Thalia , from that day on , was Hamrah 's slave . It was senseless , but I could do nothingp131for either of them . Tuka went to bed for three days . As she 'd done with her brother years ago , she 'd passed all human limits in her outburst at Thalia , and now , because Thalia had made herself Hamrah 's prisoner , Tuka could n't take it all back . She would sit very still , looking out the window , with tears on her cheeks , remembering the friendship as a woman remembers her childhood . I could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I knew he was out . Thalia came to the door and opened it partway . Her face was puffy , remote . The room behind her was full of shadows . " Are you all right , Thalia ? " I said . She nodded . " Is there anything we can do ? " I asked . Without thinking , as if she were past all thinking , she shook her head . I looked at my feet , trying to think what else to say . The door closed softly . Soon after that  --  I went on a trip for Lykourgos in the meanwhile  --  Ionabegan to joke , from time to time , about leaving Dorkis . Her oldest son , Miletos , watched her uneasily . I too watched . I had drifted into a strange indifference about my life . It was not , I thought , that I no longer loved Tuka  --  whatever that might mean . But I could n't help her . The lethargy she 'd fallen into was n't guilt  --  she knew that all of us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the injustice of life itself . Something had snapped , in all of us ; whatever it was that had held things together  --  some illusion upon which we 'd agreed  --  had lost its power . For hours at a time I would wander vaguely about my business , entertaining the thought of going away somewhere , turning to philosophy or poetry or simply observing the seasons , maybe at Krete . Iona knew . When I mentioned the feeling , she spoke obliquely of thinking of going away somewhere herself . We tempted each other toward the idea that we 'd go together , withouthope of joy or permanence , merely seizing the moment withoutdemanding much ; but neither of us would express the temptationin words . Dorkis observed us , while playing with his children or tallying his accounts , and waited . Hamrah became a new man . While we drifted outward , slipping from each other , each of our selves breaking up like old floatage , Hamrah dug in like an anchor , became his own man . When we met at large parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a man profoundly convincedof all he said , all of which was wrong . " People do twop132things , " he said , and raised two fingers . ( I was across the room , half turned away . ) " They think and they feel . When what people think goes against what they feel , feeling should be slapped unconscious . That 's humanness . Think of wily Odysseus ! That 's what 's made me what I am . " He lifted his brown marble chin . " And what do you do ? " the lady at my elbow said . " I 'm a Seer , " I said . " Ah ! " She raised her eyebrows . " Do you have visions ? " " Never , " I said . " That 's the difference between you common people and us Seers . " But I was lying , of course . I had a vision of old Klinias with his scraggly , yellow-red speckled beard and his sharp Adam 's apple and his hairy , skinny legs , pausing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us , and drawing their morality down for me . His eyes twinkled as he teased and lectured and comforted me . He loved me . And so , once , Solon had loved me , smiling at my youthful rigidity , boundlesslyconfident of my talent , it seemed , and as pleased by my faults as by my virtues . And effortlessly , without a flicker of thought , I had returned their love . Could I ever love anyone as simply and clearly as that again ? Was it mere self-love  --  my unspeakable pleasure in happening to be myself  --  a pleasure I 'd lost ? The question was arrogant , of course . A man must study to make himself more like boulders or , say , garbage.  |p133Peeker  : Everything 's going from bad to worse . I begin to suspect that my master was right in abandoning hope long since . New divisions move out to the war every day  --  it 's broken out on all sides of us now , north , south , east , west . We watch them lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravans stretching out mile on mile , the hoplites in front riding four abreast , naked except for their armor , their plumes , their streaming hair , and then after them the foot soldiers , the archers , the company of runners , and then the mulecarts and handcarts , the cooks , weaponsmiths , carriers , the pack animals , the herders with their wide herds of sheep and goats . The caravan 's there when we look out in the morning , and it takes all day to pass . Who would have believed that the city could pull together such forces ? Sometimes when a caravan 's moving out it meets with another one moving in , wagon on wagon of wounded and dead , sick men shuffling and limping behind them , gashed , limping horses , and lines of half-starved men in chains . The two armies pass without a word , as far as you can tell from here , as remote as living men and ghosts . Meanwhilein the city there are fires day and night , and sporadic noises of rioting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth tremor day before yesterday . Perhaps it 's Poseidon himself , master of all things that thunder and shake , who 's gone mad . But I have n't told the worst of it . The Spartans have introduced a new horror : mass executions . According to Agathon , no man has ever been executed for a political crime in the whole history of Athens.  |p134Here  in Sparta they herd a whole crowd of Helots , gray-faced , bruised , sickly  --  and there are women and children and old people among the crowd  --  herd them into a sloping field and shower them with arrows , and then when none of them are moving anymore , a few soldiers walk among the corpses with swords and finish off any they find still breathing . We ca n't see it from here , and no one tells us about it , of course , but Agathon says it 's happening , and he seems to know . There 's a look he gets  --  as if his spirit has abandoned his body , leaving it old and indifferent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seer , he says . I 've believed it sometimes , but not at those times when that thing comes over him , that deadly , heatless clarity of Apollo 's light . There 's some secret he 's forgotten , some trick to it , something maybe that he found in that book he used to have , or says he had : I never saw it , and it 's a hard thing to believe . Who would ever have lost such a thing if he had it ? He stands at the door with his hands behind his back and his legs aspraddle , watching the guards lead another crowd of prisoners away  --  to their death , I finally understand ; that much you can see in the guards ' eyes  --  and his stance , his face , have no expression , not pity or disgust or fear or anything : he 's like a man at a play he 's seen five hundred times . " What do the gods think ? " I asked him once . He tipped his head . A tic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each cheek , trembling like two differentzones of lightning in a night sky , and he gave a sort of apologetic , fearful smile . " The gods never die , " he said . " It makes a difference . " It was evening  --  twilight  --  when the earthquake came . Agathon was in bed . He has n't been feeling up to snuff lately . As soon as the table began to shake and the noise started  --  a terrible , vaguely human noise like the whole world groaning  --  the old man popped up on one elbow quick as a puppet , eyes wide , mouth open , ears cocked  --  I swear it  --  like a dog 's . " It 's an earthquake , " I said . But I 'd misunderstood his look . It was n't fear , or not merely that . " It 's come , " he said . " What 's come ? " He said , " The plague . " He was crazy . It sent a shiver through me to see him staring there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me later what he meant . When I pressed him he said only  --  crossly , impatiently  --  " Plagues are Apollo 's doing . Go ask him . " He wanted to get back to his writing . That 's all he does these days , write and write.  |p135I  ca n't even read what he puts down , though he says it 's all for my benefit . He 's fallen into using some obscure grammata I can'tJ make heads nor tails of . I said , " But earthquakes come from Poseidon . " He refused to think about it . " Tuka , " he said , eyeing me narrowly , " suppose I was wrong from the beginning . Suppose I misread , exaggerated trifles . . . . " I realized he was once more out of his mind . Senile . My grandmother used to flick on and off like that . He shouted , " Look out ! " I ducked . But there was nothing visible to duck from . He did that once before , when he was having a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend or something that was killed by a horse . It scared me , this time , hearing him yell , " Look out , " when he was supposedly awake . I called for the guard , but no one came . It took him about five minutes to come back to himself . And then today  --  from bad to worse , as I was saying  --  the ephors came to collect our writing . I gave them a list of enemies of Agathon 's ; it was all I could think of that might be of any use . There were four ephors this time , but I had no chance to talk to them , because of a circumstance . They brought my mother . I can hardly stand to describe it . Her hair has turned as white as snow and she can hardly walk , her knees are so had . She could hardly talk , either . She just stood at the bars hanging onto them , crying and crying . It came over me like a spring avalanche that Agathon and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , who knows ? Anyway , all she said was , " Oh , Demodokos , poor Demodokos ! What 's this world coming to ? " Sorrow rushed up in me and flooded my chest , hearing my own name , my own mother 's way of saying it . I 've been an idiot , hating her all these years , or anyway resenting her , or whatever . A boy 's mother is the most precious thing in his life . People should tell people about that when they 're young , so that when their parents get old and poorly they do n't have to be full of remorse at having thrown away the most precious thing the gods have ever given them . " Poor Mama , " I said , over and over , patting her fingers . I could n't even put my arms around her , though I tried maybe three differenttimes to reach through the bars and back in around her shoulders . I could n't even see her , in fact , because tears were streaming from my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would break , the way all she could say was my name and " What 's this world coming to ? " All her life she 's been telling people all these useful sayings like " A penny saved is a penny earned " and " Nobody loves a sluggard " and " Zeus helps them that helps theirselves . " She was a nuisance , a chain snarled around my feet , but she was something you could lean on , solid as a wall . But now here I was , sobbing and sobbing and patting her fingers , saying , " Now now ! Poor Mama ! Now now ! " When they asked Agathon for what he 'd written he did n't give them anything . He said all he had was some drawings which it would embarrass them to show them . You could see they thought he was playing some prank , and he swore a number of solemn oaths to convince them , which he did n't . But he learned some news . I did n't hear it at the time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me after they left . The ephor that had n't come before was an old man that Agathon used to see often at Lykourgos 's house , and because he was a friend and elderly , less rigid than most of Lykourgos 's men  --  so Agathon says  --  he let my master in on something . Before Lykourgosleft for Delphi , he called a meeting of the whole city . In what was for him a very long speech , Lykourgos reviewed all his laws and discussed the extent to which his reformation of the State had proved successful . He told them that he now thought everything reasonably well established , both for the happiness and the virtue of the State , but he said there was still one thing to be done , a thing of the greatest possible importance  --  a thing so important he thought it not fit to impart until he had consulted the oracle . In the meantime , he asked that they observe all his laws without the slightest alteration , despite all pressures of riot , war , and natural catastrophe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as the god directed him . Agathon says the ephor says they all agreed and wished him well , but that was n't enough . He insisted that the two kings , the senators , and all the commons take an oath that they would abide by and maintain the established form of polity until he , Lykourgos , should return . They did as he asked . A strange business . What has Lykourgos got up his sleeve ? I wonder.  |p137Another  strange business , and worse than strange : It appears that we 're to rot here in prison until Lykourgos himself either releases or condemns us . Considering the oath he made them take , I have a feeling we may be here longer than we like . It 's better than execution , of course . But then , if he himself had us arrested  --  Lykourgos , who seemed to be our hope .. . I witnessed the end of the conversation myself . It was so disgustingthat even my mama 's grief could n't distract me from it . Agathon thanked the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the ephor  --  if only he had anything to give . " Woe is me , " said Agathon , " I have nothing left but my good name ! " The ephor took it very soberly , though the other three ephors looked slightly suspicious of Agathon 's sincerity , and when the old ephor shook Agathon 's hand there were tears in Agathon 's eyes . Agathon looked to me a little ashamed of himself , but as usual he blundered on , making it worse . " I only regret that my children are not here to see me in my misery ! It would serve as an excellent lesson to them , to trust not in the things of this world , neither power nor position , nor puissance nor pelf , nor property nor politics , nor puberty nor pussy . " The ephor looked at him somewhat oddly ( Agathon was weeping rivers now ) and they shook hands again . The tall ephor  --  the one I talked to the other times  --  had his fingertips over his mouth , studying my master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agathon a cow.  |p138Agathon  : Love poetry , like anything else , is simultaneously a cause and an effect . The lover writes because the emotion that charges every line ( if the poetry 's decent ) will give him no rest until he 's set it down  --  " immortalized it , " he likes to think  --  and when he 's set it down the emotion becomes more clear , more pure , than it ever was in Nature . Art is more dignified than life , and , to just that degree , more deathlike . Insofar as it 's able , the poet 's mind rejects any word , any image or subtlety of rhythm or rhyme less grand than what he 's seen in the finest poetry he knows  --  the flesh-andbloodwoman he loves deserves at least the best he can offer her  --  and so , systematically , he distorts the real experience toward what it perhaps would have been if it had happened between , say , Odysseus and Penelope ; and then , rereading , he adopts and remembersthe experience in its transmuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , strange to say , becomes a far nobler lover than he was before , still day by day casting his net of words ahead of him to trap some finer vision . He shows the poems to his lady , who sees her admirer in a new light , clearer and paler than heaven itself , and , more important , sees herself too in a new light , and so transcends her humanness , becomes in life the once airy , visionary figure of the poems . All to the good , I am tempted to say . But I do not think the light that illuminates lovers ' verse is the light of omniscient Apollo . The lover remains , for all his fine words , a hungry , fallible , dissatisfied child , badly in need of a fallible , all-forgiving mother ; and the lady remains , for all herp139borrowed dignity and green incandescence , a girl child groping in alarm through a forest , in desperate search for a father . The light of Apollo ( I give you my word as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , but not hope . Visions , like humble pack mules , exist in time , continually relapsing , transmogrifying , forever eluding the stretched-out hand as they guide the heart , by subtle , labyrinthine ways , to the chill and mist of the tomb . It 's the same , of course , with the poetry of Patriotism . Devotion to one 's country , like any other pure emotion , is bloodless art , no healthy business of common mortals !  --  an affair for gray Phaiakians . I taught Iona writing . Merely an excuse for almost daily visits . Occasionally when I went there , always around midmorning , Dorkis would be there . He pretended , not only to me but to himselfand Iona as well , that nothing was wrong . Nothing was , in a sense . He was a man comfortable with risks . He loved her ; we knew that . And he was fond of me ; we knew that too . There was nothing more to be said : he laid no claims on life . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had to try himself sooner or later in deep and dangerous waters . If he survived , it was worth it . If he did n't , well , the gods hand down no guarantees . There are those who are shocked by such opinions . Old men rocking in their grandchildren 's gardens , their knees wrapped in comforters , their shawls around their heads  --  old men who drink herbs and observe the elements like worried sparrows  --  may cough in horror or squeak like bats in righteous scorn of the idea that taking needless risks is a desirable thing , the bedrock of character . But there are many gods , many truths , as Dorkis used to say . This truth was his , and whether he was worried or not  --  I could n't tell  --  he accepted its demands . I would visit his house and he would welcome me like a favorite brother . We would talk , the three of us  --  very interesting talks : on neighbors , politics , religion  --  and then eventually , he would withdraw to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride away with his oldest son and an assistant or two to consult with his cooks , repair some breakdown , resolve some dispute , or inspect the farms and storage units which provided the food for the communal halls , and Iona and I would go out to the garden to sit on thep140secluded , rustic bench overlooking her flowering herbs and roses , and run through our masquerade of education . Sometimes , when I found her alone , we would talk in the house , after the writing lesson . I would sit on the rug with my back against the wall , my crutch on the floor beside me , and she would sit on the pillowed couch with her legs tucked under her , and we would talk about our childhoods . I mentioned , once , my brother 's death , how I closed up like a catatonic 's fist , and how Tuka later calmed me . And I told her about Konon . He was , like me , a member of the merchant class . His father pretended to be religious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substance ; if he worshiped anything , he said , it was that . We sat in Klinias 's hut once , Klinias over at his table , reading in the book that later came into my hands , Konon and I on the floor . Konon hugged his knees , biceps bulging , his dark eyes narrowed , and stared into the fire . ( He was short , square , big-shouldered , very tan . Often he would n't say a word for hours , even days ; but then something would set him off and he 'd talk rapidly and aggressively , asserting the most outlandish things , as it seemed to me  --  how cloth retained magic as long as wood , how slavery was good because it liberated sex  --  until suddenly , as if bored , he would break off and sink back into silence . ) " My poor old mother , " he said , " had a statue of Priapos in our flower garden . I remember how she would kneel there on a spring day with a trowel in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She believed Priapos made things grow . " He flashed a grim smile , white as the moon , and popped his knuckles . " If it was true , the god must have had some grudge against my mother . Everything she planted would wither and die as if her fingertips were poison . She 'd wring her fingers and try again , praying to old Priapos harder than before . " He laughed , as if angrily , like metal striking stone . " She prayed to Pallas Athena too . She prayed that Athena would purify Father 's mind and make him faithful to her . But Athena was off fucking Hermes . " Klinias glanced over at us but said nothing . He had n't quite heard . " So do you believe in the gods , " I said , " or do n't you ? " He kept staring at the fire . " I believe in the stars , " he said ,  |p141sententious  . " They seem to be honest and reasonable . I believe in rivers , mountains , sheep , cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods ruling them , those gods are no doubt decent enough . But if there are gods directing human affairs , they 're either vicious or insane . It 's better to believe there are no gods , be satisfied with substance . " His eyes were bright as a madman 's . " Listen ! The gods give you hope  --  they tantalize you with it , and then they step on your neck . Crunch ! The last time I prayed was to Zeus , the night my mother died . My father prayed too , full of pompous moaning and hooting , but he knew she was dying . He expected it . It may be he was n't too sorry . She was a nag . So my hope is substance . You ever notice a rich man invoking the gods ? Who needs the gods if he 's rich ? He 's got gold , slaves to count it for him , and flatterers to tell him how happy he is . If he 's a whoremonger , his wife stays with him , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything on earth is substance . All the rest is drunkenness and illusion . Even ideas , they 're things grown into the brain like warts , or they 're scratches made on a scroll by somebody 's stylus . You know what death is ? An abandonedbody , you think  --  the soul flown to Hades ? Shit ! Death is a broken machine . Some muscle quits , the heart , say , and the rest of the muscles go limp , including the eves . " He was rigid now , staring like a statue . " And religion , that 's a machine too : a mechanical system of words and howls and lifted arms that you start up to comfort some fool and abandon as soon as he 's comforted . Politics , honor , loyalty  --  all machines . " Klinias looked up , roughly in Konon 's direction . " How do you account for the universe , boy ? " " Like the Akropolis , " Konon said . " Somebody built it . Some dead man . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He meant all his life to marry money , the shining hope of his corpuscularworld . He might have gotten her . He was handsome enough , and his bitterness made him attractive , in a way , though moroseness and remorse , my special gifts , have always beaten bitterness in the end . But Konon was rough , too eager for Tuka 's substance in the clinches . " What ever happened to him ? " Iona asked . Like all her ques/tions , it had some overtone meaning in it I could n't penetrate . " He turned completely to substance , " I said . " He died . " She waited , frowning a little . She had something to say . I could feel the pressure of it in her drawn lips , the muscles of her jaw , her tightly pulled-back hair . " He tried to assassinate Solon , " I said . " He was a grown man then . He thought it would be his in with the Athenian rich . It might have been , if he 'd succeeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and they could n't get it back except by ripping him off and throwing the country into civil war . There were some who believed it was worth it , and they supported Konon 's plan . When he failed they joined the others in condemning him . You never saw such looks of righteousness ! " Iona looked over my head , thinking , charged like a sky full of thunderclouds . " How come he failed ? " " He made a mistake , " I said . " He told some friend . " I could see her mind coming to it  --  flashing to it , drawing back , at last accepting it . She asked , " You ? " I nodded . That , too , she thought about , her mind racing . I could n't tell whether she was racing over her own life or mine or something else entirely , and I could n't tell whether or not she was going to forgive me for it . I hung on her judgment like a child on its mother 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on her . She said : " But what made him tell you ? Did n't he know how you felt about Solon ? " " Oh , he knew , all right . But we were friends . We 'd grown up together , more or less . We 'd had fights and things  --  sometimes hitter ones  --  but . . . " I stopped , watching her . The look of intenseconcentration , some curious excitement and perhaps suffering , distracted me , made me feel I was missing something . Did she want me to be guilty , unforgivably wicked ? " How can I explain it ? We were like brothers . Closer . We 'd talked all night many times , lying in our bunk in Klinias 's hut , looking at the dying embers of the fire . We knew things nobody living knew , except Klinias  --  things from the book . We 'd run away together once . I stole something once , and he lied for me . We 'd slept withp143girls together . Konon knew me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to talk him out of his treason  --  I told him that was what it was  --  but Konon had made his mind up . He asked me to swear I would n't tell . If I would n't swear , he 'd change his plan , do the thing some other way . I racked my brains for a way out , and finally I gave him my word . He knew what that meant to me , in those days . He felt safe . " Her eyes were still intense , tearing at me . " But why did he insist on telling you ? " " Because , " I said . And then understood with a jolt . " Because he wanted me to love him no matter what , love him absolutely , like a one-man dog , and prove it . " " And yet you told . " I nodded . She closed her eyes . " Poor Agathon . " After a long time she smiled and met my eyes steadily , as if to say more than her words could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook my head , looking away , panicky . I 'd seen how she talked to men at parties , as if each man she talked to was the finest man in the world . I 'd seen how she could fall in with strangers , make them open up their lives to her in minutes . I 'd seen her dance with men at parties . ( " I only let other men kiss me on the cheek , " she said once . " You know that . " But how could I ? I was n't at all the parties . ) She 'd had brothers . She knew a man 's pulse from across the room . " I was right , ' " I said . " It would be pleasant to think so . But I did it by impulse . Who knows what the reasons were ? It may easily have been jealousy  --  of Tuka , even Klinias . It may have been resentment : I could never beat his damned arguments about substance , but here I could beat him once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows what the answer to all his materialism . Or maybe it was ego . I could make my characterinto something by behaving as if I were it . Or the will to power . I would strike down the traitor and win the applause of Athens . " " That 's all dumb . " I 'd made her uneasy , missed the point . " So you say . Maybe so . All I know is , I gave the warning by impulse , and instantly regretted it , though for two whole days Ip144did n't tell him I 'd warned them . When the time he 'd decided on came , the guards appeared out of nowhere and disarmed him . Konon looked at me and his face twisted like a monkey 's , trying to smile . " The room became still . She looked at me , full of some feeling I coud n't read . I tried to think what I really felt about my betrayal of Konon and found I felt nothing . She seemed to love me : love , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aureole . If she loved me , was it as an amused mother , or as my own soul 's image , or as an infinitely tolerant , weary goddess ? A queer image passed through my mind , of locking her up in a room someplace as Sardinians lock up their gold . " What are you thinking ? " I said . She laughed , an explosion of the churning thought I could n't guess . She swung her legs off the couch and leaned forward , elbows on her knees . " I think we 're incredibly different people , " she said , " and incredibly similar . " " How ? " I said . " Have you got about nine million years ? " I , too , laughed . But what I wanted was an answer , final and sure as a thunderbolt . " How are we different ? " Iona retreated to the ironic mask she knew how to work so well . " All ways , " she said , turning the corners of her mouth down . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . She laughed , turning down her mouth again , then relenting , smiling and frowning . " We 'd better not talk about it , " she said . She came down to the floor beside me and kissed my cheek . But I was thinking about the brothers she rarely talked about , and the father . She knew all the tricks . I was jelly . She knew how men long to be superior , masculine ; knew how timid they are about advances , how shattered by a No . She could tease me to the limit she wanted to go and could ease me away so that I felt not rejected but mighty as a god . It was too perfect . I was n't worth it . I was her toy . But my God how I loved her and wished it were real ! But what if it was ? " What was your father like ? " I said . She sat on her feet and thought , then began talking softly . Inp145the mountain village where they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were large , sharp rocks . They swam there , and he looked on with stern approval . He was fierce as a lion all his life , but he was n't bitter until after Iona 's mother had left him , when the children were grown , to go off with some prophet from the far northern hills . Iona 's father had become , then , an angry , misanthropic old man . I put my hand on hers . " Are you like him ? " I asked . " Ridiculous ! " she said , laughing . Perhaps she was n't , I could n't be sure , but she carried his image like a carved stone in her heart . " I have to go , " I said . After a moment she nodded , a little stiffly . I climbed up my crutch into the room . " I 've stayed too long , " I said . " Forgive me . " I offered her my hand to help her up and , after a second 's hesitation , she accepted it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was she angry ? I leaned on the doorframeas I always did when leaving her , my hand on the door but my chest undecided , and I watched her face , wondering if I would kiss her . She did the same , though perhaps thinking about something different , leaning on the other doorframe . She watched my face as I watched hers . It would have been better if we 'd worked out some ritual , I thought , or settled the matter by going to bed . But our metaphysics or something was against it . At last she came to me and put her arms around me . " You are a good man , Agathon . " " Who knows ? " I kissed her . As usual , it was n't enough . I held her close , moving my hands on her smooth small back and then her hips . Then , as usual , I paused and we waited for the sign that neither of us would give alone , true democrats , and it was over for another day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . The flowers , the birds , the sunlight were out of their minds . It was a terrible time , for Tuka . I never told her of my visits to Iona , not so much from cowardice , I think , though I never deny my cowardice , as from a wish to spare her unnecessary grief . But she knew about them , or some of them . When our familiesp146were together Iona would sometimes show knowledge of things she ought not to have known , and Tuka would ask questions , casually , lightly , and Iona , as casually as possible , looking guilty as hell , would mention that I had dropped by . It made Tuka furious and a little frightened , though she would n't show that to Dorkis or Iona . " Agathon , they 're practically slaves , " she said . It was the worst she could say , and my total indifference to their accidental and irrelevant condition frustrated Tuka to the edge of violence . " What do you think people are saying about you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she knew , too , my indifference to the nonsense people say . She loved society , the conversation of her own kind , as the saying goes ; as for me , Sparta was my hermitage from all that . There were none of her own kind here , or mine . The Spartans , whom I thought less than human , were our supposed superiors . The few Athenians in town were black-market pigs . She blinked all that , playing aristocratic lady in a dung heap she changed by her imagination to elegant old Athens . Why she 'd come with me in the first place I could n't say . She almost did n't . When the carriage arrived to take us away from Athens , she sat in her room and refused to move . I gave her ten minutes and went out to the carriage to wait . At last she came , still furious , weeping . But in time she accepted her life in Sparta . She made our three rooms in the palace a fair imitation of Athens , and she created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her harp , an imitation of Athenian society . It was temporary , she understood . What stories we 'd have to tell when we went home ! Even my consort with Helots was acceptablein those terms . And she did not actively dislike the friends I made among the Helots . In her generous moments  --  that is , when she felt secure in her total possession of me  --  she could understand that they were merely victims : she herself might be a slave , if Sparta were ever to capture Athens . And she , as an Athenian , had known Korinthian slaves who had once been aristocratic masters . In fact , she had very much liked Iona and Dorkis , at first . Iona might have been her closest friend , if I had n't gotten involved . Now she was afraid to leave the house , for fear Iona might appear ; afraid to let me go off by myself in the morning , for fear I might go visit her.  |p147It  was a strange , irrational hatred , and she knew it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I woke up in the morning and looked at her , with sunlight falling over her shoulders and glittering in her blue-black hair , she seemed the most valuable thing in the world to me . I 'd press closer to her warmth , nestling up to her firm , broad-beamed buttocks and sliding my hand around her waist to her breast . Then for a long time I 'd lie half awake and half asleep , all our lives since childhood closed together , secure and safe , as if the room we lay in were not mere physical space but a bubble of time . We would hear the children 's voices in the next room , and the bubble of time stretched outward to include them : my son , absentminded and quiet and gentle as myself ( or gentle as I liked to imagine myself ) , kneeling by the seashore shaping huge figures out of sand and stone ; our daughter , clever and sly and as beautiful as Tuka , hoarding her treasures in Tuka 's cast-off woolen purse , or climbing some tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . It was absurd that Tuka should doubt that I loved her  --  loved all of them . Sometimes we 'd ride to the hills north of Sparta and would sit on some cliff looking down while the horses grazed behind us . On a clear day you could see for a hundred miles . She said , once , " Do you ever think of Thaletes ? " I smiled to keep her from seriousness . " Never . " " He was never happy except when he was facing death . That was existence , he thought . " " This is existence , " I said . I nodded toward the city far below us , miles away . " I know . Standing back from things . Seeing where you are . " I glanced at her strong , fine legs . " I meant beauty , " I said . " That too , I suppose . " She put her hand on mine . " But you ca n't see that either unless you 're back from it . " She looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I forget I love you until someone starts stealing you from me . " " Nobody 's stealing me , " I said . She squeezed my hand . " Damn right . " After a while she said , " Poor old horse . " It was our word for Lykourgos . " What does he do for pleasure ? " " Bites himself , I guess . "  |p148She  laughed . " And other people , yes . And yet I admire him . He knows what he wants . " " Like you , " I said . Her fingers drew away from my hand to pull some grass . " Little good it does me . " Him either , I could have said . I tried to imagine Lykourgos in love , mournfully , hopelessly in love with his brother 's wife and convinced that she was merely toying with him , a woman everybody knew was loose , and as beautiful , people say , as he was ugly . Was Kharilaus his son ? No matter , of course . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn , as if someone had stolen her earring . She continued pulling grass , casually , grimly , as though it were the dead Iona 's hair . I sighed , faintly grieved and weary of broodings . " One must try to want what 's possible , Tuka . " " I know . " She would n't look up . " Is she better than me in bed ? " " Tuka , Tuka , " I said , growing wearier and wearier . " Whateverpeople may say in Athens , the world is not made exclusively of beds . " " But tell me . I have a right to know . Is she better ? " " I have n't slept with her . " " You 're a liar . " She glanced at me , and I shook my head . She closed her fist hard on a pebble beside her knee , as if to hurl it at me , but she did n't . " All the worse , then . How can mere human flesh compete with some glorious airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods  --  " " Do n't bother , boy . " She stood up abruptly and started for her horse . She walked like a Spartan soldier girl , her whole body hard as nails except for her lips , her belly , her breasts . I loved her . Why was she blind to it ? " Do you want the truth or do n't you ? " I yelled . She stopped , turned , put her hands on her hips . " If you sleep with her , I 'll kill you . " I raised my hand slowly and kissed the fingertips , Solon 's gesture , saying good-bye to life . She sank to her knees suddenly , as if the strength had gone out of her legs , and covered her face ,  |p149crying  . I only half believed it . " Why ca n't you ever talk to me ? " she screamed . " Why ca n't you see when I need you ? " " So I see it . You need me . Everybody needs me , even Lykourgos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her muscles growing tight , and I was worried : it was a thing I 'd seen before . I went to her and put my arms around her , but her muscles stayed tight . Her face was as stiff as a mask . " Tuka , listen . I love you . Listen ! " It was Konon 's word : Listen . The recognition checked me for a second . Everything I said , everything I ever did was somebody else 's , not mine . An empty ritual , nothingness . But I said , " Listen , Tuka , please . I love you . " It was true , probably , yet I knew I could have said it as easily , and as honestly  --  and would say it , if the need arose  --  to Iona , or Dorkis , or my children , or Konon . And I could have said it as convincingly to Lykourgos 's stooge Alkander if ever some stillwarmember of humanness in him cried out in need of me . And yet I did love her , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was it the world that was ? But she was rigid as stone , and all the time my mind played games I was rubbing her back and arms , kissing her temples , whispering to her , like an actor . I summoned up tears . At last , all at once , as if something had broken , she relaxed , crying again . I went on whispering a while longer , wondering how I was going to get both her and the horses home , since Tuka was in no shape to ride . " I love you , love you , love you , " I said . I would stake the horses , I decided , and send someone back for them . I told Iona I could see no more of her , it was unhealthy . Luckily , I had work to occupy me . Lykourgos had a stack of documents for me to copy , his new labor and reprisals code . He used me , I suppose , not because he lacked scribes of his own but because , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my flaccid Ionian reaction . ( In those days he still put his laws on parchment . ) Not that I would be likely to change his mind ; I knew that by now . I played out my role of righteous indignation not for righteousness ' sake anymore , but for art 's . To tell the grim truth , I could see no dignified alternative . I might stomp and bray and disembogue for Athens in a great show of out/rage , but it would be an empty gesture : I would change nothing in Sparta that way either , and I knew I could n't face without a sneer or an obscene giggle the people at home who praised my righteous noise . I might strike out at Lykourgos  --  kill him , say , or make seditious speeches in the marketplace  --  but who but a fool would believe me if I struck out now , after years of silence , even bootlicking ? I would n't believe myself . I could do it , I was sure . I could as easily shuck off my dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while that I was acting not from noble principlebut to appear a man of principle , or to please my old mother , or to break the dull routine of life , or for some other silly reason . There was , it seemed to me , a certain moronic virtue in giving Lykourgos my honest reactions to his monstrous ideas . Until one thinks of something better to do , one should do what one is doing . " Carry on ! " as Solon would say . " Love , carry on ! " Two weeks later , I met Iona by accident on the street . She looked shocked , horrified , when she saw me , and she instantly turned away with a squeezed-shut , wounded , stubborn look , as though my face were a wolfish attack on her . I had known that my breaking off with her would hurt her , but I had n't guessed that the pain would last so long . Her look filled me with confusion . I did love her ; she knew that . And not seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to blame for her misery : life itself was . Apollo 's seduction . Poseidon 's stupid restlessness . Yet she was miserable , so that I , too , was miserable . To continue the separation was empty righteousness  --  love reduced to arithmetic : Tuka 's love minus Iona 's love equals Virtue , three dead crows wired to a fence . But to end the separation was nonsense too . Tuka would be hurt and eventually , no doubt , Dorkis . I walked half the day , trying to make up some kind of reason for action . Around midafternoon I saw a donkey beaten by a screaming slave . A troop of Spartan soldiers walked past , eyes steadily front . Were such things omens ? I concluded that the world was insane . I went to her house that night . The door was unbolted . I went in . She was sitting on the floor , laboriously copying from a scroll , a page of Solon 's opinions that I 'd given her weeks ago . She looked up in alarm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to think of something I might say I 'd left at her house and had come for , but nothing came to me . I stood . " I thought I 'd never see you again , " she said . " Not possible , " I said . I realized for the first time that my bad leg was on fire from all that walking . " Is Dorkis home ? " I asked absurdly , maybe pretending I 'd come to see him . " He 's in there , working . " She moved her head in the direction of his workroom , prepared to lead me there . " He works too hard , " I said . There was a silence . I went over to her and , with difficulty , got down on the floor beside her and studied the scroll . I made no comment . She expected none . At last , after a deep breath , she said , " Well ! " I smiled . " How 's Tuka ? " " Fine . " " You still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good . I 'm so happy for you . " Another long silence . Dorkis came in from his workroom and , when he saw me , smiled , holding out his arms . " Agathon ! " The lamplight played over his shoulders and head as if he 'd brought it with him . " You 've been working late again , " I said . " You 'll ruin your goddamn eyes . " " You 're right . " He laughed and rubbed his hands like an innkeeper . " It 's time for wine .  --  Iona ? " She nodded , and he ran in place , the way athletes do before a meet , showing his eagerness to serve , then went , bent over like a sprinter , to the next room for wine and cups . When he came back , swooping in with the cups all in one hand , the pitcher in the other , he poured wine for each of us  --  his own puissant , meticulously cured honey brew  --  then sat down on the couch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest scheme , the brotherhoods . From now on each table at the eating halls would be made up of a company of " brothers , " four older men , sixp152younger men , chosen by the vote of the whole company . The old men would train the young men 's wits , teaching them sententiousdiscourse and seemly humor . A bad joke would be punishedby a bite on the thumb . We laughed , all three of us , but Dorkis was looking above our heads , like a contestant assessing a vault while he jokes with admirers . The Spartans were getting to him more and more . It was not exactly that they shook his calm , you would have said , but they were there ; increasingly there , like omens . " All this will pass , " I said . He smiled . " In five hundred years . " " Nonsense , " Iona said . " Do n't be pessimistic ! " " Ah well , " he said , and smiled again . He fell silent . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He looked vague , so I added : " Sparta . Who would have thought human nature would let it get so far ? " " We overestimate human nature , " he said . " I think about it sometimes , in horror . " He smiled . Horror , like everything else , he had learned to duck , shrug off , accept in peace . " You get in the habit of thinking you do things for certain reasons , but you do n't . All you can do is act , somehow , and pray . " " You think the gods hear you ? " I asked him , noncommittal . He grinned again . " Somebody has to be listening ! " " But suppose they 're not , " Iona said , curiously feisty . He gave a laugh and stretched out his hand toward her , palm up , his sharp black eyes on her face . " Are you ready to take life on without them ? " She said nothing  --  pouting , it seemed to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woozy from the wine . " But what do the gods do exactly , Dorkis ? " He thought . " Did you ever do anything in your life that was n't by impulse ? " he asked . I frowned , troubled by where he was going to lead me . " Never , " I said . Thinking : Do n't say it , Dorkis . For God 's sake ! Solon 's kind of indignity I could take . " And where do you think impulses come from ? " he asked , gently triumphant . His absolute and simple faith filled the roomp153like autumn light , like a sea breeze . Even when his ideas were crazy , the man had sophrosyne , as they used to call it in the old days . There are men in this world  --  wizards , witches , people like Lykourgos  --  who spread anger , or doubt , or self-pity , or the cold stink of cynicism , wherever they walk : the sky darkens over their heads , the grass withers under their feet , and , downwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are men , here and there , like Dorkis . God only knows what to make of them . Their ideas are ludicrous , when you look at them . Peasant ideas . Childlike . But what tranquillity ! " That 's very interesting , " I said , resisting his mysterious effect on me  --  from guilt , maybe ; my lust for his wife  --  and I pretended to think about it . " Do bad impulses come from the gods , or just good ones ? " He was n't put off . Benevolent . " There 's a sense in which there are many many gods , " he said , " and they 're not all in agreement . But what we call good , with our little minds . . . " His eyes snapped away . " There 's a sense in which nothing is evil , " he said , calm as spring . " To certain people , everything that happens in the world is holy . " " Nonsense , " Iona said . It was her favorite word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged and looked down , unable to argue with her , but not because he was beaten . " It 's not as easy as you think , Iona , " I said . " Dorkis could be right . Suffering 's bad , but sometimes the effects of suffering ... " Why did I say that ? Guilt again ? Defense of his thought because his wife 's smile filled my mind from wall to wall ? " That 's dumb , " she said . " Tell me that after you 've ended people 's suffering . Then I 'll believe you . " She drained her cup and held it out to Dorkis . He filled it for her . I too took more , though I should n't . She said , " What people like us need in Sparta is men . All we get is pious philosophers . If you were men you 'd act first and then make up theories . " " You sound like Lykourgos , " I said . " But it 's true . " She was petulant . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe , " Dorkis said . " But dead men do n't make up theories . " He grinned , palms up in a helpless gesture , as if accepting human impotence along with the gods ' other gifts . " Better a living fool than a dead philosopher , " I said . A dullard 's observation , needless to say . Did I sound ironic , shifting loyalties ? She ignored me . " It is practical . We could overthrow them . You personally , Dorkis . We control all the food , all the clothes , all the work  --  everything that supports their life  --  and you have all the contacts . " And why , I wondered , was she suddenly so full of revolution ? It was a thing she had n't mentioned for a long time . Did his calm force her to thoughtless opposition ? Because of me ? Because of guilt ? His eyes widened and he laughed . " Iona , you 're crazy ! " It hit me that this was the first time she 'd mentioned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you realize what would happen to us if we failed ? " he said . " You 're simply crazy . " His eyes were full of light , a husband'spleasure in the girlish foolishness of a now more than ever precious wife . Yes , she could work men . He would have second thoughts on the scheme . Inevitable as sunset . " It 's true , " I said . " Crazy as a loon . A pity . " She said nothing . We drank . It was late now . I should have left long ago . At last Dorkis got up , grinned , and announced he was going to bed . " I 'll be along , " Iona said . I sat still , rubbing my sore leg and casting about for reasons to go or stay . He waved and left us . We both sat in silence for a long time after that . At last she rolled up the scroll and her copy and tossed them up onto the couch . She lay on her side with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved but the lamp flame , flitting in and out through the wall paintings , making the stiff leaves and artificial flowers of Iona 's decorations quiver and stir as if alive . No sound came in from the street . " I never knew two weeks could be so long , " she said . " Was it long for you ? " " I kept busy , helping Lykourgos . " She laughed . A fine laugh like a girl 's . " I really believe it . "  |p155I  put my hand on hers and she smiled , shaking her head as if in disbelief . " You dear , good man , " she said . " Not necessarily good , " I said . " Everything 's good  --  holy , in fact . I just learned . " " And you believe it ? " She lay back and looked at the ceiling . " It 's sad to find that a relationship you thought was very close and beautiful is not what you . . . imagined . I ached a lot , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought we always knew each other 's feelings . " She was aching now . We 'd switched again : I the father , she the little girl . " He knew , all right , " I said . She shook her head . " What could he have done ? Of course he knew ! " " No . " There were tears in her eyes , and I was startled . She loved him more than I 'd admitted to myself , and I was jealous . " So he missed it , " I said , " So he 's only another damn human . " She reached up to touch my face and then , as if by impulse , drew me down to her , kissing me . " I know . " I 'd had too much wine . I could hardly focus her face . Even so , she was beautiful  --  as beautiful , in her separate way , as Tuka was . I had some vague thought about Dorkis 's conflicting gods , but I was too foggy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no possibility now of hiding the visit from Tuka . I no longer cared . It was impossible to serve all the gods . Ride it out like a bird . I remembered the strange madness that had come over Tuka , the rigidity of every muscle , and I was grieved , hopeless . But Iona 's mouth tasted of wine , and the flesh of her hip under my fingertips was soft , naked under the loose robe . " It 's strange that I can do this to Dorkis , " I said , brushing my lips across her cheek . " In theory , I 'm an honorable man . " " You do n't understand him , " she said very softly . She said nothing after that for a long time . Then , wistfully , " Do you think he 's lying awake , full of jealousy , suffering ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " Would you , in his place ? " A whisper . " No , " I said , but doubtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , " she said . She kissed my cheek . " You 're her life . I wonder if you can call it love at all , what she feels for you . " " I do n't know . " I tried to think . Lying in her arms was like lying half asleep and half awake in the bottom of a big , safe boat . Her low , soft voice was as comforting as the click of oars or the thud of small waves against the hull , quiet as a heartbeat . It was not just the wine , this sensation of endless peaceful floating , fathoms of dark sea yawning below me , bottomless kingdom . I 'd often felt the same with Tuka , the strange peace of the child in its first calm sea , or the peace of the grave . Could this , more than what Tuka felt , be called love ? But I had never been afraid of Iona . I had been startled , now and then , by her temper , but I had never been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I had stayed too long , had come to Iona and abandoned hope , so that I was no longer afraid of Tuka 's wrath  --  wearily indifferent  --  I saw the fear I had felt before clearly . I 've been afraid of my wife , I thought , surprised . And was Tuka also afraid of me ? Maybe love , like the Just Life , was a mythological beast . But for all my questions , I floated on , serene . Despite her deeper love for her husband , I could love Iona 's gentleness and goodness . I was satisfied . I lay almost over her , her bosom my pillow . When I started to slide my hand under the robe to her breast she touched my hand lightly . " I 'm sorry , that was stupid , " I said . She was silent , not disapproving , but she had decided , and she was right . I felt like an ikon thief . I kissed her one last time , long and gentle , then got up . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . My leg was throbbing , but I observed the fact indifferently . My own pain was the least of my troubles . Once , when I was younger , playing in the yard with a friend 's small child , I swung the child around and around , holding onto his feet . The child laughed , frightened and joyful , but I realized after I 'd set him down that , much closer than I 'd realized , there was a tree . If the child 's head had struck it , I 'd have killed him . I remembered it now . To live at all is to be a threat . She came to the door and took me in her arms and kissed me again . " I love you , Agathon. "  | " I know . " I walked home . It was a long way . When I arrived , there were friends there , childhood friends of Tuka 's , visiting from Athens for three or four days . They were all high on wine , hardly aware of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain my lateness they accepted casually . We talked  --  Tuka , the friends , and I  --  until sunrise . Just like old times . Three days later , Tuka learned that a year or so after our marriage I 'd slept with a girl friend of hers , named Klytia . It was nothing , a meaningless night of " good friendship , " as we say in Athens . But Tuka was outraged , as much at the cruelly false friend as at me . She came into the room where I was talking with Iykourgos and three of his ephors and said , " Agathon , I need to talk with you . Now . " I excused myself and we went to our room . She closed the door and told me what she 'd learned . She was white . " How could you ? " she hissed . The hopelessness came back , the incredible weariness . " Nonsense , Tuka . It was years ago . " " Nonsense , ' " she mimicked . " That 's her word . Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . Do you ? " " How could you ? " she said again , and began to cry . " Every friend I ever had is another piece of ass to you . Love , ' you say ! You do n't know the meaning of the word ! " " That 's true . If you 're finished  --  " " I 'm not ! Explain it to me ! Explain how your fancy metaphysicsteaches you to screw every goddamned whore that comes after you . Explain it ! " " They 're not whores . They do n't come after me . If you 'll quit ranting and think a minute  --  " " Ranting ! " She seized the pitcher by the bed and hurled it . I let it hit . It bounced off my shoulder and smashed . " I 'll talk with you when you 're calm , " I said . I went to the door , went out , and closed it behind me . When I returned to the room where Lykourgos and the others sat , they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , " I said . " Nothing serious . "  |p158We  talked . I teased Lykourgos a little more sharply than usual , but otherwise it was as if , in truth , nothing had happened . When I went back to our room , perhaps two hours later , Tuka was sitting motionless on the bed , staring at the wall . I spoke to her . She did n't move . I touched her . No response . It struck me that maybe she 'd taken some poison . I could n't believe it , and I knew that it was more likely that this was the end of the thing I 'd seen the start of several times before , the odd rigidity . But I was scared . " Tuka , are you all right ? " I asked . No response . I pushed at her shoulder . She fell backward onto the bed . I straightened out her legs and looked at her , trying to think . I was convinced now that she 'd taken poison . She lay still as a corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped her face hard there was no response . A machine , I thought . Some muscle quits , the heart , say , and the rest of the muscles go limp , including the eyes . I knew I should call a doctor  --  the thing was beyond my knowledge of medicine  --  but I was afraid . " Tuka ! " I said . " Come back ! Wake up ! " I tugged at her shoulders , shaking her . Nothing . I tried her pulse . It was faster than my own , but I could n't remember what that meant . " Tuka , Tuka , Tuka , " I whispered . But her mind was far away , sealed up like a grave . She farted , or defecated  --  I could n't tell which and was afraid to look  --  but that too brought nothing human to her face . At last , with the same weary hopelessness I 'd felt before , when I abandoned her , I sent a servant for a doctor . He came in half an hour  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose  --  and examined her without speaking . " Shock , " he said at last . He bled her and forced a liquid down her throat . When he finished he turned his head to look at me , quizzical . " I 've seen this in cases of rape . Was she raped ? " " Not physically , " I said . He said she 'd be like this for two days . He left . Later , when the servant brought the children home from school , I took Kleon in to see her . He was ten , a thoughtful , moody child , and it was better that he see her than wonder . " Is she dead ? " he asked . I shook my head . " She 's all right . She just ca n't move right now . She 'll be herself in a day or so . " He sat down on the edge of the bed , watching me to see if it was all right.  | " Touch her hand if you want , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk . " It was true that she knew he was there . There were tears in her eyes . He touched her hand . " What 's wrong with her ? " he asked . I thought . " She 's unhappy . So unhappy she ca n't move . She does n't believe I love her , though I do . " " Will she know in a day or so , when she gets well ? " A logician , poor child . A philosopher . His life was going to be hell . " No , " I said . " Once you ask that question  --  does he love me ?  --  you ask it forever . " He patted her hand , full of sadness . I believe he understood . I stayed with her , watching for a sign . When I woke up in the morning , two days later , she had turned her face toward me and was looking at me . When I realized what it meant , I kissed her . She returned the kiss , gentle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she said . " But I have to go . I 'll go back to Athens , with the children . " " Do n't talk , " I said . " Later . " She was quiet for a while , and I lay with my cheek on her shoulder . At last she said , " No one should have as much power over another person as you have over me . There 's nothing I can do to you . If I sleep with another man , it does n't bother you . If I ever tried to fight you , you 'd break my neck . I 'm helpless . You have no feelings . " " I do , " I said . She rolled her head back and forth on the pillow . " No . I 'm not criticizing . It 's just a fact . There 's nothing I can do to hurt you the way you hurt me . It 's not fair . " " Do n't think about it , " I said . I kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slept until late afternoon , and when she awakened she looked as if she had n't slept in days . She looked old . " Agathon , " she said , " I ca n't stand leaving you . " " Then do n't . " " I have to . But not Athens . " " Whatever you say . " " You have to help me . I 'm too tired to think . Where should we go ? "  |p160I  shook my head . " Why should I help you do what I do n't want you to do ? Work it out yourself . " She stayed that night , putting it off until tomorrow , and I made love to her . The next morning I said , " Put it off for a week . If it 's serious it will still be serious a week from now . " She looked frightened . " You know what will happen . I 'll stay . " " Maybe . But try it . One day at a time , second by second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay . I visited Iona and told her what had happened . Iona said nothing when I told her , merely , " Strange . " I could n't tell whether she was alarmed or grieved or what : her face was wood . She asked me questions about Tuka , and I told her all I could  --  her childhood , her father , her friends , her music . She kissed me when I left  --  clung to me , her cheek against mine , but she looked past me , her mind far away . A few days later I visited her again . We sat in the garden behind her house , where she 'd been collectingflowers for one of her decorations . She said , cold-eyed , smiling like ice , " I 've figured out why I love you , Agathon . " " Good , " I said . " It 's a kind of revolt . I 've cleaned house , cooked meals , borne children , all without stopping to think about it  --  obeying the laws of Nature and Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something . " " Commendable , " I said . " Do n't mock . I mean it . If it were n't you , it might have been someone else . When I fell in love with Dorkis it was because the time had come for me to break free . From my parents , that time . From childhood . Now it 's from the drudgery of a wife . " " Maybe that 's so , " I said , though it was n't . She knew it was n't . I looked up into the bare branches of the tree arching above us . I was very tired . The chilly air seemed heavy on my arms and legs and chest . My bad leg , asleep , was heavy as a log . After a long time , Iona said , " Do you suppose everyone in Sparta knows about us ? " " I suppose , " I said . " Then we should stop , should n't we ? " She pursed her lips , seriously considering it , or pretending to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the answer might be hidden there , written on the petals . " It would be a terrific idea , if it were possible . " She started to nod , then checked herself , still studying the flower . " Anything 's possible , Agathon . " Her smile could bring an early winter . I shrugged . " Sure . " So break it off , I thought . She leaned forward , clasping her knees in her arms . All I thought , all I was , disgusted her . I could n't miss it . " You really believe that no one can ever change anything , do n't you ? " " No , " I said . " One can change things . One can stab people . One can break up people 's homes . One can throw out one tyrannicalgovernment and put in a new one for somebody else to throw out . " " Solon 's ? " she asked . " Is that tyrannical ? " " Not at the moment , " I said . " Not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teeth . " Thank God I 'm no philosopher . " " Oh , you 're a philosopher , all right . You 'll no more start a revolution than "  --  I hesitated , then went wearily on  --  " than Dorkis . " " Wait and see , " she said . Her tone grieved me . At least for now , she meant it . " Second by second , " I said . " Oh , nonsense . You say that too often . Second by second . ' You 're like a machine . " Her annoyance was not seductive now . It was withering . I felt a queer flash of panic . " It 's true , " I said , clownishly morose . " Except that I do n't say it . I just open my mouth and it comes out  --  an impulse from the gods . " " There are no gods , " she said . I looked up into the trees . When we parted , that day , we did n't kiss , though she gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dropped the flower in my hand . No doubt she had her mind on the revolution . Tuka said , " You were there ? " I nodded . " I was there . "  |p162I  spent the afternoon with the children , telling them the glorious story of Herakles . " Tell them the story of Akhilles , " Tuka said , " how the poor boy died for love . " I smiled and shook my head . " An idle tale . "  |p163Pee  ker : I ca n't get the picture of my mother out of my mind . The white hair , the tremble of the knobby fingers . I 've got to get out of here . And yet how can I ? Even if I could escape some way , or get the tall ephor to do something , as I 'm convinced he wants to , even then could I go back to my mother and help her , now when she needs me , and not help poor Agathon ? I think of taking care of them together , feeding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laugh . It would be safer putting a tiger and a smart old snake together in a cage . Yet I 've got to do something . No choice . I told Agathon the problem and he went on writing , scratch on scratch , leaking out the obscenity of his life . " She 's old , " he said . " Everybody dies eventually . " " I could say the same of you , " I said . He paused and glanced up , leering . " You 're beginning to catch on ! " Smart-ass old bastard . I should brain him with the chamberpot . But I was only mad for a second or two . I understand him better and better . He 's philosophical about death . Good . But I hear how he groans and whimpers in his sleep , and I see how goddamn scared he is when he peeks out through the cell door , watching the fires . He jokes about how when they drag him away he 'll bawl like a baby the ephors have decided to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the jokes : he really will bawl , and stupidly , hopelessly , he 'll try to bribe them , and when theyp164lift the execution rods over his head he 'll die of terror . So would I , maybe , though I do n't think so . The difference between us is that he hates himself for it , hates himself for everything , and hates everybody else that shares his faults . As simple as that . Agathon , the great lover , hates people . He told me a story once . I did n't believe it at the time  --  I thought he made it up to convince me that he really used to have the famous book  --  but I 'm not sure now . It could be true . There was an empty crypt in the graveyard next to the shrine of Poseidon  --  a very old crypt that he learned about from a man in Korinth . The bodies had been removed a long time ago , maybe a hundred years or more , and the door had been sealed . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , a large movable stone half buried in vines , and when Agathon went to look where the man said the entrance was , he found it . The crypt was the perfect place to hide the book . So night after night Agathonwould sneak out to the graveyard , taking a few scrolls at a time and ducking from tombstone to tombstone and tree to tree till he reached the crypt , and at last , after weeks of this , his treasure was hidden . He could go there when he pleased and close the secret door behind him , and he could read with no crack of light showing until the air became too thin to breathe ; then he 'd blow out the lamps and open the secret door until morning and then close it and steal away home to bed before anyone was up . Not a soul in all Sparta knew about the place , not even his wife . Then came the revolution . He had friends that were up to their ears in it , especially the woman he keeps prattling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , shrunken , rolling-eyed as a wolf . The grass wherever she touches it turns to dust . It may be true that she was beautiful once . You might even say that she 's beautiful now , if you like your beauties old as Time , and violent , and crazy . ) One night she and her husband and their people burned up the hall of ephors . By morning it was nothing but stone walls and window holes . ( They 've rebuilt it since , though not the way it was before . It used to be carved columns , beautiful hangings , statues , the works . The inner supports are now planed timbers , and the only decoration , if you can call it that , is Poseidon 's iron trident . Statues encourage hero cults , Lykourgos says. )  |p165Anyway  , someone saw them and recognized one or two Helot faces . So the Civic Guard was after them , and Iona , or else Dorkis , one of them , went to Agathon . She knew he had some secret hiding place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt . They put on pressure . ( Iona , it must have been . Both of them must have known that sooner or later , even when the book was involved , he 'd succumb to her . ) And at last poor miserableAgathon showed them the secret entrance and the revolutionists  --  allbut the leaders : Dorkis , Iona , and one or two others -- went in . They bored air holes and closed the entrance behind them . No one knows for sure what happened then . Some Spartan saw them going in , or some informer revealed their hiding place . Within hours the Civic Guard had cracked open the front door and thrown in oil and lit it . Those who tried to escape by the secret entrance or the open front door were struck down like pigs at a slaughterhouse ; those who did n't flee died in the fire . The Guard waited until it was certain that no one had survived , then left . Until then , the Helot crowd watching could do nothing . But as soon as the Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the horror and reclaim their dead . Agathon was one of the first . No one noticed , in the beginning , what he was doing . While the others were dragging out bodies , hunting in the maniacal way people will at such times for some sign of life , and grieving when they found none  --  old men tearing their clothes and hair , women beating the ground , screaming  --  Agathon was rescuing the charred remains of his scrolls of dead knowledge , hurriedly stepping over bodies , as indifferently as he 'd have stepped over stones , snatching up the parchment husks and running with them , weeping and moaning , to the torchlight where the others were examining their dead . Cruelly , like a sow driving through children to her litter , he pushed past mourners , trampled dead men 's outstretched hands , till he came to the center of the torch 's influence and threw himself on the ground to peel blackened page from blackened page , searching for some remainingscribble . He would howl , finding nothing , and would tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wild look , remembering the crypt , he would charge back through the mourning crowd , indifferent to their lives and sorrows as a battering ram ,  |p166and  would search the blackened room again . Long after he knew there was nothing there he kept returning to the place , searching and whimpering like a bitch who 's lost her pups . They saw it , at last : separated their grief from his and reacted like a single heart to the outrage . It was the women first . Some woman , pushed over as Agathon ran past , looked up from the corpse she futilely soothed , and saw , and understood , and screamed . They seized him by the hair and clothes , pulled him to the ground , began beating him and scratching at his face . Then the men and children understood and started kicking him and throwing sticks and stones . They would have killed him except for Dorkis , his friend . He appeared out of nowhere , as if shot down by lightning , shielding Agathon 's body with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light no one recognized him . He caught stones as they came and hurled them back , snatching up stones from the ground with his free hand . " Wait ! " he kept yelling , hurling stones with the aim of an infantryman . Whether his barrage checked them , or whether they finally recognized him , Agathon could n't say , telling me the story . They paused , anyway , and Dorkis rose to a crouch . " What 's the matter with you people ? " he yelled . The women told him , sobbing , all of them speaking at once . ( Agathon got this all at second hand . He was out cold . They 'd fractured his skull . ) Who knows whether Dorkis understood their jumbled noise or simply knew , knowing his friend ? " Go away ! " he said . " You have no idea how this man loved his book . You 're fools ! Idiots ! Go away ! Mourn your corpses ! " They were swayed , or shamed . Who knows ? They backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , and they began the process of carrying away the dead . Dorkis threw Agathonover his shoulders and carried him the mile and a half to Dorkis 's and Iona 's house . Dorkis worked on him all that night and all the following day  --  Agathon remained unconscious  --  joiningbroken bones , forcing in the mysterious Asiatic medicines he 'd learned in his father 's house in Hydrea . For six days Agathon remained a breathing corpse . When he awakened Dorkis was sittingabove him , upright , unsupported by his chair but fast asleep . Agathon asked for water , and Dorkis was awake in an instant  |p167It  was months later  --  a week before Dorkis was executed  --  that Dorkis said to him , almost pityingly , as Agathon tells it , " You care more for knowledge than for people . " " No , " Agathon said . Dorkis smiled . It was a terrible smile , as Agathon reports it . Dorkis was blind , at this time , and he 'd been beaten till he was a mass of raw meat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't said I do n't love you for it . "  --  Something has dawned on me . Agathon 's friend Dorkis was the man the revolutionists called Snake  --  the man I saw die . The mutilation , the blindness . Yes . He died like a god . Inexpressible . When the Spartans killed him , they killed him at the first blow  --  an extraordinary mark of respect . Everything I think is confusion ! Crazy old Agathon 's best friend in Sparta was Snake ! They called him " The Mind of the Revolution . " Famous for his wisdom , his gentleness in private life , his deadly efficiency  --  until the time of his great mistake , the night he showed up with the sympathizers at the crypt . They had evidence before that . Documents . But no one believed , no one could connect him with the revolution . Then why ? Why throw away his safety for Agathon ? If he was wise , as everyone says he was , he must have known Agathon 's thing for his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for him . " You have n't suffered , " Agathon tells me . " That 's the problem . " Not like him , thank God , not by betraying everything I ever loved without lifting a goddamn finger . He made his beautifulIona ugly , and drove his wife Tuka home to Athens , and all by mere Nature , without a malicious thought . He 'll wreck me too , if his luck holds out . I should strangle him , and save the whole human race !  |p168Agathon  : Curious how my mind wanders , these last few days . I watched a terrible thing once . Why it should come back to me so forcefully now is not exactly clear . A man sees horrors enough in Sparta . NeverthelessI was up near the shrine with the children  --  Kleon and Diana  --  exploring . Kleon was about nine , I think ; Diana something like seven . It was before the revolution  --  if you can really date the beginning of such things . We 'd been climbing the ancient stone path all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( We saw one on the path , far below and behind us . It did not occur to me to wonder , at the time , at its coming up toward the trees with its load of sticks . ) The stones of the path had been worn smooth as old coins by generations of Helot laborers , donkeys , cows , and goats . Here and there tufts of grass and bright blue flowers pushed up between the stones . The bluffs soared up to our left , rising from the edge of the winding path and cluttered with huge boulders that looked like wolves ' heads , sleeping bears , the bones of giants . It reminded me a little of Athens . Between the boulders there were patches of short , brittle grass and twisted , dwarfish trees . Beyond the wall to the right of the path  --  where the wall itself had not fallen away  --  the bluffs rushed down toward a chasm where one of the streams that feeds the Eurotas rattles over little falls , pauses a moment in deep still pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . I held Diana 's hand , Kleon walking to the left of me and a little ahead , his heels just out of reach ofp169my crutch . All the way up we 'd seen almost no one  --  only four old Helot peasants fishing in the stream below . We came around a sharp turn in the path , and there , high above us , stood Menelaos 's shrine . It was clean and white and solemn as a ghost on its cliff overlooking dark-green wooded slopes , its four front pillars set against the chasm like fists . Beyond the pillars , below the wide roof , the shrine sank away into darkness . We paused , startled by the suddenness of the shrine 's appearance . It seemed that the place might indeed be the home of a god . Then we hurried on , climbing toward it . When we reached the place there was no one there , only the rows of darkening columns , the torch rests ( but there were no torches ) , and at the center of it all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no priest . The children talked in whispers as we moved through the place ; as for me , I talked hardly at all . It was as if the air were filled with omens I could n't read . And it was , maybe , though the coincidence of place and event was accidental . Diana said , " Daddy , listen . " We stopped walking . Nothing but the wind in the trees above the shrine . We took a few more steps . I was aware of the floor 's hollow boom . We listened again . She said , " There 's somebody coming . " And now I too heard it , children 's voices , chatting , casual , coming from somewhere in the trees to the north , beyond the outer row of columns . For some reason  --  it may have been something I heard without knowing I heard it  --  I took their hands and quickly led them away from the altar and out into the sunlight and through it to the trees to the east of the shrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is something wrong ? " Kleon asked . I shook my head . But something was . I could n't put my finger on it . A group of Helot children broke out of the trees and ran laughing and talking toward the shrine as though it were a place where they played often . There were  --  I do n't know  --  maybe ten of them , all very young , ragged and dirty , children of the lowest class of semislaves . Most of them were girls , and one of them , Ip170remember , carried a handful of limp wild flowers . As they ran through the sunlight toward the shrine , the hackles of my neck rose and I knew before I saw them that there were others besides ourselves watching . I knelt down , in the shadow of the trees , and laid down my crutch and pulled Kleon and Diana to the mossy ground beside me , motioning for silence . They watched in fright , and I knew that in a moment Diana would scream . I closed a hand over each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , dressed in the loincloths of their war exercises , came out of the trees stealthily and ran in a crouch toward where the children played . They were smiling , the Spartans . It was unbelievable , nightmarish : not human . I heard the screams of the Helot children as the Spartans reached them , and the same instant I saw the Helot men coming out of the trees and from under the altar . One of the Helot children lay in a pool of blood  --  dead , I was certain . But now the Spartan boys had seen the men and understood . Ambushed . The Spartans could have run , but they turned and faced the Helots , witlessly brave , as usual . The Helot men surrounded them and killed them with their clubs and work knives . And now the cart we had seen on the path came up to the shrine as if casually , and the Helots lifted out the sticks  --  their children silent now , terrified and numb  --  and lifted in the dead Spartans , bright red with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and covered the bodies with sticks . They splashed water on the blood-spattered floor of the shrine and worked quickly , efficiently with rags , cleaning up all signs . After that they vanished into the trees . The whole thing had taken perhapsten minutes . I listened to the rumble of the cartwheels on the stones of the path , going down again to the valley , slowly , slowly . The driver looked asleep . Kleon vomited . That night the children lay wide-eyed , shivering . Two servants carried in the harp for us , and Tuka played . Lightly , at a Helot party later , I mentioned the incident to Iona . " Horrible ! " she said , then whispered , " but what do you ex-pect ? "  |p171Agathon  : Also this : One night at a party at Dorkis 's  --  a dark , ugly party , cloying funereal roses and ferns , because the revolution was on now , the laughter and chatter rang hollow and thick as the jokes of trapped miners  --  Tuka told Iona 's oldest boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaving Dorkis , and that Iona 's basic problem  --  the reason for her drunks , her indifference to her family , her bold activity in the senseless rebellion  --  was that Iona was insane . All this came out very casually , I understand . Casual as the blueblackwelt , the fire-scarred fingers of the testy little man who sat in the corner of the room , never speaking , starting wildly whenever a new guest knocked at the door or a cup fell to the polished stone floor and shattered . The boy , Miletos , was fifteen : a beautiful , curly-headed innocent . It was his first adult party , the first time he 'd drunk wine with his parents ' strange friends . ( There were no Spartans there that night , and no Athenians but ourselves . ) He was in the kitchen cutting cheese to take in to the others , and Tuka was helping him . She 'd always been fonder of him than of all the rest of Dorkis 's family put together , because he was the gentlest and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome besides : he made her remember her own youth , her own ideals . She wanted to protect him , save him from pain and disillusionment like her own . He must have understood that as plainly as I did . He must have understood everything , in a way . If he was baffled by what he felt around him  --  the emptied ,
