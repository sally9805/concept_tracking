O'KEEFE <P> Eagle River , Wis . <P> Sir / In view of the very warm Egyptian reception afforded Nixon , dare we hope he will seek asylum ? <P> ED WACHSMAN <P> Columbus <P> Black Middle Class <P> Sir / TIME has done a cover story on blacks June 17 that gives an underclass black reader the enlightening facts about our brothers and sisters who are together , educated and successful . Your reporters should be congratulated . <P> KEITH HAMMETT <P> Dayton , Ohio <P> Sir / It is regrettable that a magazine with your circulation and assumed journalistic integrity would ignore the realities of our racist society .

The power structure of the U.S. has but one classification for all of us-black . <P> O.C. BOBBY DANIELS <P> Amherst , Mass . <P> Sir / I am sure that many middle-class whites who are not " making it in America " read your cover story with great interest and enjoyment .

Can we pride ourselves on having so many internationally successful statesmen that we can do without him ? <P> ( MRS . ) ILONA ROHONYI <P> South Orange , N.J. <P> Kleindienst Duped <P> Sir / As I read of Richard Kleindienst 's loss of composure at his sentencing June 17 , I realized that all these men , including Haldeman , Ehrlichman , Dean , Magruder and even possibly Colson , were not the over-zealous corrupters of the office of the presidency . Rather they were the idealistic dupes of a corrupt , embittered President intent upon the political and financial destruction of all his imagined enemies . <P> BERNICE SIROTA <P> Miami Beach             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
