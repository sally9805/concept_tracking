txt Mayor Lindsay 's closest advisers are talking about last week 's prison distrubances as the most serious crisis the Mayor has had to face during his tenure in office . " It was by farthe roughest single situation I 've seen in five years , " says Jay Kriegel , an aide who has been with Mr. Lindsay through the thickest of problems and wrenching decisions that have punctuated his mayoralty . " It was worse than the riots , worse than the garbage strike , worse than anything . " The 110-hour crisis in the first four days of the month , in which rebellious inmates in the major detd , oion centers took over their cellblocks and seized 28 hostages , took place on the frontier where politics , administration and the social pathology of the city meet . The frontier  --  the administration Of justice in the city ? was depressingly familiar : Months and months of waiting for trial and sentencing , acute overcrowding , filthy living conditions .

" The situation had elements on the municipal level just about as delicate as the Cuban missile crisis , " says Thomas Morgan , the Mayor 's press secretary . " Remember , 28 lives were at stake in every decision we made .

But certainly we were always aware of the national attentiort , and that if any harm came to the hostages there would be a lot of second guessing . " In retrospect , " Mr. Aurelio went on , " it 's obvious that failure could have had a terrible effect on the Mayor 's national reputation and on any national aspirations he might have . " The crisis began and ended at the Queens branch of the House of Detention in Long Island City , a 95-year-old Victorian relic where 294 prisoners awaiting trial or sentencing ? some of them for more than a year ? and 41 inmates serving misdemeanor sentences exist in cells designed to hold 196 .

Before dawn Saturday , Mayo Lindsay took the first decisio that was to bring him , step b step , to the center of the publi stage .

When the hearings were over , the inmates released two hostages , but kept the three others in violation of their promises . One of the 18 hostages at the Tombs was also released , reducing the total in the city to 23 . At 6 P.M. , Mayor Lindsay made a statement indicating that he had decided to use force rather than continue negotiations .

Mayor Frets About Supplies However , after a brief nap , Mr. Lindsay began to fret about incipient shortages of tear gas and other police supplies .

Mr. Gersten wanted to order 1,200 tear-gas grenades from the city 's supplier - in the western Pennsylvania town of Saltsburg .

The firemen found the manager in church and called him out to receive the order for the shells , which were delivered in the city at 3:15 A.M. the next day .

The Mayor 's weary staff as sembled at the mansion in the early afternoon to plan action at the two most difficult trouble spots ? the Tombs and Long Island City . It Was decided to give an ultimatum to the inmates , allowing them a half an ' hour to turn over the hostages or face an attackMayor Lindsay sat down with a yellow legal pad to draft his statement . The first problem that arose was delivery of the ultimatum . One plan was to have someone go up in the Tombs ele , vator to the 11th floor , push a loudspeaker out and then quickly retreat . " We had to give that up , " Mr. Kriegel recalled drily . " We could n't find a volunteer . " When it was ascertained that the prisoners had radios , and , after the police and Correction Department forces were in place at the Tombs , he Mayor made his broadcast over WINS and ' WNYC at 9:30 . ' This is Mayor Lindsay speakng to the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the Mayor 's staff and the hostages , there was bedlam in the auditorium after the ultimatum . Some inmates set up a chant of " Let them go , let them go , " but one of the hostages spoke up . " No , " he cried , " Do n't let us go . You 've got them by the ? . Keep negotiating . " The dissent from an unexpected quarter set off a fierce two-hour debate . While the Mayor and his staff waited anxiously in Gracie Mansion as the deadline slipped past , ' the argument in the Tombs raged . Eventually , it was resolved in the Mayor 's favor and the hostages were freed . As he had promised , the Mayr went to the Tombs to talk ith a delegation of 11 inates and 10 hostages . Mr. Aurelio went to the warden 's office in the Long Island City jail . " It was eerie , " Mr. Aurelio said . " There was no solid door between the office and the cells so you could hear everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open telephone line to Grad rt e Mansion to report on developments . The Mayor 's ultimatum was broadcast at 5:30 A.M. Monday . " There was silence for two or three minutes , " Mr. Aurelio recalled . " Then someone yelled , ' Get back to your cells , turn off the lights and fight to the end , " . Resistance , ls Favored Then there was a call for a vote by tiers on what to do . The tier captains called down their tallies , and when it was over , four ? of the five groups had voted to resist . " We thought that was it , that it was all over , " Mr. Kriegel said . " The Mayor went into the kitchen and made a pot of coffee . We just looked at each other . " ? Two incidents intervened to change the picture . Al Castro ; director of public affairs in the Correction Department , made an emotional appeal to Puerto Rican prisoners , in . Spanish , to surrender and avoid bloodshed . Outside the prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the ? backup police force , made a decision that the Mayor 's aides later characterman ized as brilliant . The comder , thinking the inmates might be awed by the assembled police Might , ordered floodlights turned on the massed patrol cars and armed squads . Inside the jail , there was a call for another vote and this time it was nearly unanimous in favor of surrender . At the same time , a group of inmates took the hostages and rushed pro them to the main gate to - tect them from the ' militants . Within moments , there were no hostages left in the city jails . At City Hall in the days the after e crisis , there was quiet pride in the accomplishments of the Mayor and his staff . At the same time , there was upli acknowledgment that a dcate of the crisis could happen in any jail at any time , and that sweeping reforms of the courts and jails , demanded by the Mayor , would be difficult to achieve . The participants also remembered a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsay . " I 've been in jails all over the South , " the man said , " and I do n't have to tell you they 're bad . But when you come to New York you expect a little class . Mr. Mayor , this jail is terrible . "
