From October 27 through October 30 a sympo  --  sium on the Middle East will be held in Washing  --  ton , under the aegis of the respected Israeli magazine New Outlook . What lifts this confer  --  ence out of the ordinary is the presence among the participants of a number of Israelis and Palestinians . Although similar meetings have oc  --  curred in Paris and elsewhere , this is the first time that representatives of the two sides ? along with Americans , Europeans and Arabs  --  have been brought together publicly in this'country , The stated intention is to advance " awareness of the centrality of the Palestinian problem " to " genuine peace in the Middle East . " In August , when fifteen members of the Knesset announced their intention to attend the symposium , a furor was touched off in Israel , and there were kindred incidents of opposition among Palestinians . As the aftermath of the An  --  drew Young resignation proved , private diplomacy can unleash storms of emotions . There are deep-set fears on both sides that even unofficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about talking , may be misconstrued . Too often in this country the Israeli-Palestini  --  an conflict is framed in stereotypical terms . Reality is , of course , much more complex  --  as the heated debates in the Knesset and fac  --  tiousness in the P.L.O . demonstrate . After weeks of the headlined adventures of an opportunis  --  tic Rev. Jesse Jackson , emotional rhetoric blanketing all Palestinians as " terrorists " and Fidel Castro 's comparison of Zionism to Nazism , it is time to listen to a sampling of the voices of the people of the region who are most directly affected . New Outlook 's symposium could ' provide an instructive microcosm of both the dialogue that is , and the dialogue that must be , if peace is to be achieved . RUSH TO DEATH SPENKELINKS LAST APPEAL This week Jesse Bishop is scheduled to did in the gas chamber in Nevada . He has pleaded guilty and refused to authorize appeals . The twelveL year unofficial moratorium on capital punish  --  ment in this country  --  a moratorium interrupted only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who demanded to die  --  was ended by the electrocution of John Spenkelink on May 25 . During the sixty-five hours prior to Spenkehnk 's death , a last-ditch appeal was mounted by two Georgia lawyers , Margie Pitts Hames and Mil  --  lard Farmer , and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark , ' a longtime opponent of capital punishment . The following is Clark 's account of that appeal , excerpted from a longer version . The issue Clark and his colleagues raised had not been previously considered in the six years of appeals in Spenkelink 's case : did he have ade  --  quate representation by his court-appointed counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment ? The question was a grave one , but beyond that , Clark shows how the judicial system brushed it aside , brooking no further delays in the State ' of Florida 's implacable drive to activate the death penalty . ? The Editors RAMSEY CLARK John Spenkelink was scheduled to die at 7:00 A.M. Wednesday , May 23 , at Raiford Prison in Florida . Tuesday morning I flew , from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was met by Henry Schwarzschild , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's Capital Pun  --  ishment Project . We , drove to Starke , Florida , near Raiford Prison to protest the execution and to bear witness . After a late-morning press conference outside ( Continued on Page 400 ) tances " from the United States might be much higher ) . Most of this U.S. money goes to the families of imprisoned terrorists . There is no evidence that it is used to buy arms . The document from which these figures are quoted fell into the hands of P.I.R.A . earlier this year , and they leaked it to the Irish press . The story proved severely embarrassing to the British Government , for it reported in detail the British Army 's reasons for believing that the guerrillas in Northern Ireland could keep going for at least another five years  --  and probably longer : " The Provisional I.R.A . has , the dedication and sinews of war to raise violence intermit ? , tently to at least the level of early 1 seeable future . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available and there will be many who are willing and able to use them . Any peace will 4 superficial and brittle . A new campaign may well erupt in the years ahead . " The doc  --  ument went on to enunciate this chilling conclusion : " We see no prospect in the next five years of any political change which would remove P.I.fe.A. ' s raison d ' ? tre . " , The Provisionals ' " Tet offensive " of last August would seem to justify the pessimism of the British Army docu  --  ment . It is a war the British Army can not win . The search for a military solution is futile . Increased military repression will not stabilize an inherently unstable state like Northern Ireland , but only increase its instability . If the Conservative Government acted on the conclusions in the document drawn up by their own generals , they would declare their intention to withdraw from the Irish situation altogether . What keeps them there is their fear of a civil war sparked off by Protestant terrorist reaction to such a development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placate the Protestants , and it is the Protestants that the British will have to confront if they desire a long-term solution to an age-old problem . q Spenkelink ( Continued From Front Cover ) the prison and another at mid-afternoon with Lois Spenke  --  link , John 's mother , who brought what proved to be his last public statement , I had returned to town . I spent thirty minutes trying to place a telephone call and five reading the local paper . We ate a late lunch ; then , to burn off energy while waiting for the all-night vigil , I took a walk through town and around the courthouse . As I crossed a filling-station apron on the main street , a young man ran up and said I had an emergency call at the motel . It was from Margie Pitts , Names , an Atlanta lawyer who is a friend and colleague in the A ) C.L.U. It was 5:30 P.M. Phones at the motel Were tied up by the press . Circuits out of the small town of Starke were busy . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . we were able to place a call from the filling station and reached Margie in Tallahassee . She told me she had just talked to Millard Farmer , a Georgia lawyer who heads a . comprehensive litigation effort in death cases called Team Defense . Millard first studied the notes of a skilled appeals lawyer who had analyzed the trial transcript carefully . This lawyer argued persuasively that the defense attorneys were ineffective . Reviewing the trial records himself , Millard was convinced that Spenkelink had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel . He had been formally authorized by John Spenkelink to enter his case earlier that day . Margie had reviewed what Millard found , looked at parts of the trial record herself and agreed . She augmented Mil  --  lard 'S work with her own findings and ideas and helped draft an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus raising the single question of effective counsel . Margie asked me to listen while she read the pleading ; if I found it had merit , I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Elbert P. Tuttle , a senior judge oh the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit . She began a litany of allegations familiar to all who have followed capital trials in the United States these last years . John Spenkelink 's trial attorneys were court-appointed . They lacked sufficient resources to prepare and conduct the defense . One publicly stated that the case was beyond his competence . One was absent during part of the jury selec  --  tion to be with his wife in childbirth . He had not sought a delay in the proceeding or permission of the court to be absent . Spenkelink 's lawyers also failed to challenge the composi  --  tion of the grand and petit juries . Both were later found to underrepresent blacks , women and young people  --  groups considered by most experienced attorneys to be favorable to the defense in capital cases . The lawyers failed to ask that Spenkelink be tried separately from his co-defendant who was acquitted . Severance was authorized under Florida law and would seem strategically important . Counsel failed to challenge excessive security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prejudicial to a defendant . After reading the record , Millard Farmer believed the defense lawyers were too poorly informed on the rules of evi  --  dence and procedure in capital cases to conduct an effective defense . They had informed the jury in their closing argument  --  ment that the judge could not impose a more severe sentence than the jury recommended . This may have encouraged the jury to ask for a maximum sentence , leaving the judge , the full range of punishment alternatives . Counsel failed to obtain a transcript of questions asked prospective jurors , which was necessary in determining if they were constitu  --  tionally selected . The Florida Supreme Court ruled that all objections had been waived . With their client facing death , counsel did not request oral argument on appeal in the Supreme Court of Florida . Next , Margie sketched in a background of John Spenke  --  link that convinced me he had not been adequately defended .. With his strange foreign-sounding name , style , voice , ap  --  pearance , a long criminal record , he had testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might affect a jury . From years in prison , homosexuality and homosex  --  ual rape were something he could describe as naturally as jurors would a Sunday School picnic . A jury in Leon-Coun  --  ty , Florida , might find him guilty on his appearance and testimony alone . Then came what was for me the clincher . Spenkelink 's father was a paratrooper in World War II . He jumped with the 82nd Airborne Division . When it was nearly wiped out , he.was transferred to the 101st . He fought in the Battle of the Bulge . The war weighed heavily on him . Life was n't easy thereafter . To his son he was a hero . One day , when John was 11 , his father went into the garage , attached a hose to the car exhaust , started the motor , put the hose in his mouth and asphyxiated himself . John found his father dead on the garage floor with the hose in his mouth . The troubled youngster began a career of minor crime . ' Prison psychiatrists examining him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part due to the suicide of his father and that he was amenable to treatment . Incredibly , when the sentencing phase of the case was tried , these facts were not presented to mitigate the punishment . A jury would not give a death penalty in the face of such evidence . John Spenkelink was a second-generation casualty of World War II . My own experience with capital cases , familiarity with the records of many other cases , and years spent working with the problems of obtaining lawyers to represent poor people accused of crime have taught me that the overwhelming ma  --  jority of those on death row did not have , effective assistance of counsel . Most were represented by court-appointed law  --  yers or public defenders . Few of these lawyers had much experience . All met with hatred from the community , the police and even the judiciary . They had no adequate resources to investigate and present a full defense . Their ac  --  cess to psychiatric and other professional services was severely limited . Many were afraid of their clients andunable-to communicate meaningfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces arrayed against them that they did n't press obvious points like fair jury selection , discovery of the prosecution case , insistence on public funds for investigation , or vigorously argue every issue . Criminal defense counsel are usually young  --  conscien  --  tious and more courageous than the bar generally , but also less experienced , often overburdened with cases and usually underpaid and unable-to finance the defense themselves . If the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is to have meaning , the question of effective assistance of counsel must be asked and answered constantly . Lawyers hate to charge other lawyers with having failed to adequately represent a criminal defendant and rarely do . Where the defendant is indigent , it adds insult to injury . In death cases it is especially hard . Are you saying their indif  --  ference or incompetence cost a client his life ? Clark told Hames that he would leave immediately for Atlanta . On arriving , he hurried to Millard Farmer 's office , where the petition for habeas corpus was being typed up . By 11 P.M Farmer , Hames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuttle . Tuttle , whom Clark has long re  --  garded as " a genuine American hero , " was for twenty years Chief Judge on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit during the stormy era of segregation cases , and consistently ruled to enforce constitutional principles in civil rights cases . Mrs. Tuttle answered the door , ' and graciously led us to her living room . As we settled down with Judge Tuttle , she retired . I had not seen him in a decade . Now in his early 80s , Judge Tuttle was as erect , dignified , alert and interested as ever . He knew of course why we were there . He stated at the outset that he was pleased to meet with us , that he would read our petition and hear our plea . But he cautioned us that he had not granted a writ of habeas corpus since assuming senior status a dozen years earlier and did not see how he could do so now . Then he asked why we had come from Florida to bring a Florida case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping , as lawyers call it , offends the idea that courts dispense justice uniformly . It implies that judicial favoritism is being sought , an advantage gained by going outside the usual channels . The statute giving Judge Tuttle jurisdiction required an explanation of why the case was not taken to a Federal judge . in Florida . I gave him a hard , straight answer . This case had been in the courts for six years . The Federal district judges in Flor  --  ida had reviewed it at length time and time again . It had been rejected on other grounds just the day before by the District Court in Florida . The Legal Defense Fund had made prodigious efforts at the District , Appellate and Supreme Court levels . N ow we were eight hours away from an execution and ' a new and difficult question , never raised in the case , and one courts and lawyers alike abhor , was raised . Did Spenkelink 's court-appointed Florida lawyers represent him effectively ? There was little chance that judges with six years ' involvement behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too late to go elsewhere . We needed a very courageous , very inde  --  pendent , open-minded and fair judge . That is why we chose Judge Tuttle . That is what I told him . Millard Farmer described what he had found reviewing the trial record . Judge Tuttle was quick and to the point with questions . He knew the law and that he had jurisdic  --  tion and therefore the duty to decide . His first question was , why did a jury impose the death sentence ? Spenkelink 's sentence cried out for explanation . This should not haVe been a capital case . Prosecutors pay little attention to murder among convicts . When blacks , - convicts and other " despised poor " kill one another , our society-has not cared so much as it does when " one of them kills one of us . " Here there was a claim of self-defense , that the defend  --  ant had been homosexually raped and his money taken from him , that he had entered the motel room to recover his money and go his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ger , stronger , had spent decades in prison and was in viola  --  tion of parole at the time . He heard someone in his room . There was a struggle . He was killed . The death penalty is not normally asked for or given in such cases . But Leon County , Florida , is special . More than half of all people on death rows in the nation are in three Southern states ? Florida , Texas and Georgia . This unequal distribu  --  tion only begins to suggest the severely limited number of jurisdictions prosecuting capital cases . Most of the more than 300 men in these three states were convicted in a hand  --  ful of counties in each state . The prejudices of the prosecu  --  tors , political ambitions , local idiosyncracies , community attitudes in these counties were the determinants . Had these events occurred in nearly any of America 's 3,000 other counties  --  or even in Leon County at another time  --  it is very unlikely the prosecutor would have asked for death . Although I ? ? cr't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l , only one explanation seemed an ans , - : , f co . u - r. ' , ' , 1 . CL i i011 : The jury hated John Spenkelink . His own'testimony must have done it . An outsider with a strange name , a convict , a. troublemaker , and finally a life style that deeply offended the jury . A man describing his own rape , homosexual conduct , a life of crime , was scum , not to be believed , who ought to die . The jury had heard no explanation of how Spenkelink came to be what he was . They did n't know that this man , as a child , had found his hero father dead , a suicide . Did n't know of the instability and pain in the family before the father 's death . Did n't know how the child had been affected by finding the father he loved on the garage floor dead by his own hand . When the story was told , Judge Tuttle did not hesitate . He said he would grant a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition . He said it quietly , as simply as that . Did we have an order ' prepared ? No , but Millard Farmer quickly wrote one out in longhand on a coffee table in Mrs. Tuttle 's living room . While Millard wrote , the judge and I talked . He said he did n't favor abolition of the death pen  --  alty in all cases as he knew I did . At 11:30 P.M. Judge Tuttle signed the order . We rushed to Millard 's office in a state of euphoria . It was now after midnight . We encountered difficulty getting a phone call through to either the Governor in Tallahassee or the warden at Raiford . Millard found a pilot who would fly us to Flor  --  ida , but before he could get the plane ready we had spoken with the authorities , who assured us that the stay would be honored without actual service of ' the papers . Millard ar  --  ranged to have copies of our petition and Judge Tuttle 's order available for the Attorney General that morning . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of trial counsel 's adequacy . The stay of execution meant Judge Tuttle would either assign the matter to the appropriate district judge , or hear it himself . He wanted to meet with the parties to determine these issues Wednesday afternoon but the Attorney Gen  --  eral 's office declined . We outlined the issues and evidence for the hearing before I left . We could win this case , I felt . We could be ready for a hearing within weeks . I caught a flight to New York at 7 A.M. Clark returned to New York , and the next day , Thursday , May 24 , tried fruitlessly to reach Florida Attorney General ' Jim Smith , in order to learn if the State would seek an emer  --  gency review of Judge Tuttle 's stay . Later , Clark learned that Smith had held a press conference at which he vowed that the execution would take place . Smith then flew to Washington and filed a motion in the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate Judge Tuttle 's order . Clark and the other defense lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned of it only after the results were announced . The Supreme Court , with only one dissent ? Justice William Rehnquist  --  denied the State of Florida 's appeal , and the stay held . Justice Rehnquist wrote that his " difficulty un  --  doubtedly stems from six years of litigation . " He said con  --  tinuing appeals could " result in a situation where States are powerless : to carry out a death sentence " ; he was also critical of the defense 's new contention that Spenkelink had not had effective counsel . Justice Rehnquist found it hard to believe that the defendant had suddenly determined this after six years of trial : fEither he does not believe the claim himself or he had held the claim in reserve , an insurance policy of sorts , to spring on a Federal judge of his choice if all else fails . " Clark 's response to this charge is : " To presume that a man whose life is at stake does not believe a claim made in his behalf with no evidence to support the presumption is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre  --  sume , as the exclusive alternative , that the claim was deliber  --  ately held in reserve as ' an insurance policy of sorts ' is con  --  trary to reason and the entire appellate history of the case which was vigorously presented . Mr. Justice Rehnquist decides issues of fact without theevidence when a man 's life is at stake . " The State had another card to play . At 7 P.M. on Thurs  --  day , as Clark was about to go home , he received a call from the clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans , who told Clark that he was setting up a conference call between three judges of the Court : of Appeals ? Judges JameS P. Coleman , Peter T Fay and Alvin B. Rubin , who were to rule on a request from the State of Florida that Judge Tut  --  tle , ' s stay of execution be set aside ? Florida Attorney General Smith , and Millard Farmer , Margie Hames and Clark . The call began ( Judge Fay , was unavailable ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ques  --  tions of jurisdiction for an hour . . The telephone conference Was a nightmare . We were told at the beginning not to record what was said . The court did , not have our papers . We had not seen the State 's papers . Some factual statements in the State 's papers were in error , but we could not know , this until we saw them some days later . We were asked whether we had gone to Spenkelink and urged him to attack his trial lawyers , to which we replied , if so , discipline us , ' do not kill him without deter  --  mining his rights . There was loose , unstudied , uninformed discussion about whether Judge Tuttle had jurisdiction , whether he entered a final order- , whether the Court of Ap  --  peals had power to review his order . It soon became clear that the bizarre late-night argument over long-distance phone among lawyers and judges who had not seen the papers in the case nor been briefed on the issues was worse than meaningless ; it was dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not legally required to give us the opportunity to discuss the matter over the telephone . We asked for time to file affidavits and a response to the State 's motion . The merits of our petition for a writ of habeas corpus had been barely discussed . A representative of the Attorney General 's office , Margie , Millard and I made some emotional conclusory statements and the call was over shortly after 8 P.M. , , , I returned hOme to wait . As the hour grew late , I became worried about how I would get to Washington and the Supreme Court if the Court of Appeals acted that evening . I phoned Judge Coleman , told him it was raining in New York , there could be delays in transportation , the last flights and trains were imminent , and that I must know whether I had to seek action by the Supreme Court . He said he did n't know , they were having trouble agreeing , but he assured me I would have time to obtain review if it became necessary . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute Judge Tuttle 's stay was vacated . He said that as a.former Attorney General , he knew this and assured me any order his court might enter would not be effective until I had time to seek review by the Supreme Court . In view of the extraordinary procedure that had been , followed , I had no confidence what this meant . I called Attorney General Smith to urge him to agree to time for briefing the issues before the Fifth Circuit . I told him we had done the court a disservice in the telephone discussion because no one had studied the issues or unusual procedures used . His public duty to fairness required study to be sure justice was done . He said he had been in the room in Talla  --  hassee during the discussion , but decided not to speak . To my request , he answered only , " I could n't do that . " About 11:50 P.M. the phone rang . It was the clerk of the Court of Appeals calling from New Orleans . He had an order to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited four cases that had nothing to do with any issue before the Court of Appeals , and had not been mentioned before . It concluded , " We are convinced , for reasons which will hereafter be stated in a formal opinion , that the aforesaid stay should be vacated . " The order added , " The motions of Spenkelink for time in which to file supporting affidavits , etc. , is denied . However , counsel on both sides have been given the benefit of an extensive discussion of the matter by conference telephone with a quorum of the court . Further ordered that this order vacating the stay of execution granted by Judge Tuttle shall become fully and formally effective at the hour of 9:30 o'clock Eastern daylight savings time , Friday , May 25 , 1979 . . . . Judge Rubin reserves the right to dissent for reasons to be assigned . " When I called Atlanta top tell Millard and Margie of the order , only nine and a half hours remained in which to pre  --  sent the matter to the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margie 's husband and a senior partner in a distinguished Atlanta firm , had flown to Washington sev  --  eral hours earlier with a draft petition to the Supreme Court . We reworked it over the phone to conform to what we now knew of the actual order . Margie would call the changes to Bill in Washington . I would join him there . He would have the papers ready when I arrived . The next commercial flight to Washington was at 7:00 A.M. Too late . The next train at 3:30 A.M. was due in Washington ? at 7:30 . Too late . Joel Berger of the Legal Defense Fund helped me call charter flight companies but we could find nothing . So Jack Boger at the Legal Defense Fund picked me up shortly before 2 A.M. and we drove through heavy rain to Washington . We could only seek a discretionary writ from the Supreme Court . It had denied such writs generally in death penalty cases since 1976 . Indeed , although John Spenkelink had tried four times to obtain Supreme Court review , the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court had been battered by successive days of debate on a stay for him . On Thursday , it had denied two petitions in his case . It was hard to be optimistic now . Bill Hames was already in the clerk 's office when I arrived shortly after 6 A.M. I read the pleadings , we filed them and then waited for the clerk , Michael Rodak , to arrive . Rodak came in about 7 A.M. He refused to see me . For more than an hour Court officials would not say whether any Justice was in the building . We were to take it on faith that the Justices would actually see our pleading , a little painful when an execution is possible within hours . The pro  --  cedure at that stage renders effective assistance of counsel meaningless . How can any lawyer be effective when he can  --  not know whether the judges receive his papers ? The prac  --  tice results from the Court 's excessive desire for secrecy . Eventually , reporters told us who had been seen entering the building . Rodak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to see me . I could not find out whether the Court had notified the State of Florida that it was considering our petition . Shortly after 10 A.M. , I was handed an order . " The application for stay of execution , presented to Mr. Justice Powell and by him referred to the Court , is denied . Mr. Jus  --  tice Brehnan and Mr. Justice Marshall would grant the stay . Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part . ? . . r At the bottom of the order were the initials W.E.B. , apparently written by the Chief Justice of the United States . I wondered whether they were written larger , smaller , or the same as usual . j ohn Spenkelink was dead within half an hour . We are told he was denied the chance to make a last statement , verbally abused by the guards , fought removal from his cell , was gagged and forced to the chair . Three successive bolts of electricity were sent through his body . Parts of his body were burned . His fingers curled backward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made . There are still those who believe , like Dr. Guillotine , that there is a humane method . As a lawyer I have no doubt that Judge James P. Cole  --  man , joined by Judge Peter T. Fay , who did not see the papers we filed or hear arguments , violated John Spenke  --  link 's constitutional right to due process of law . There can be only one explanation . Coleman wanted the man executed quickly , regardless of the law . Why the rush to execution ? Why ' would he take the unprecedented action of reviewing the State 's petition late at night without requiring it to be submitted first to Judge Tuttle ? There is no greater expert on the very issues of jurisdiction the State raised than Elbert Tuttle . He is chairman of the Advisory Committee on Civil " Rules and vastly experienced in the subject matter . The issues raised in the conference call were technical but very important. * Why did Coleman proceed after years of *Judge Coleman based jurisdiction on an appellate rule even though no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not even properly before his court . He ignored the habeas corpus statute , which denies the Court of Appeals jurisdiction over original petitions for habeas corpus He considered a stay order a " final order " in violation of a statute that required a certifi  --  cate of probable cause  --  a stay order that was clearly made in order to preserve jurisdiction . careful , painstaking litigation to compel exhausted lawyers and the court to discuss a life-and-death case late at night , over the phone , without exchanging papers , without giving time for review or study , without alloWing time for support  --  ing affidavits ? Why did he not wait until Judge Fay could hear the argument ? Why did he cite four irrelevant cases never mentioned in the papers or the discussion in an order written at home and dictated over the phone to a clerk ? How could he decide the matter without having facts to judge whether there had been effective assistance of coun  --  sel ? Since Judge Fay did not hear argument and should not have voted , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vacate Judge Tuttle 's order ? And why had he not given his reasons ? Judges deciding death cases ought to give reasons . Having waited several weeks for the formal opinion he had promised , I called th4clerk and inquired about it . I was called back and asked to send a letter . I did . No answer . I wrote again . Finally , on July 23 , two months after John Spenkelink 's execution , the clerk 's office wrote " that in review of the action taken by the United States Supreme Court subsequent to thattaken by the Court in the stay for Spenkelink , the majority of the panel does not intend to write anything further with reference to this case . " Attached was a memo dated July 18 from Judge Rubin . " I reserved the right to dissent from the order issued by the panel in this case , and I now confirm that I do dissent , on proce  --  dural grounds , from that action . " He too declined to give reasons . I wrote the court on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write an opinion and inquired : " Are we to believe a formal opinion has not been written because a formal opinion which justified the court 's action which led immediately to Mr. Spenkelink 's execution can not be writ  --  ten ? " There has been no reply . The courts must require a full review of the effectiveness of trial counsel and the ade : quacy of funds for investigation and expert witnesses in every capital case if Sixth Amendment rights are to be ful  --  filled . They should initiate procedures now to alleviate a pervasive problem . Worse than Justice Rehnquist 's hostility and Judge Cole  --  man 's abuse of power is the direction their petulance over delays takes . Courts may well resent the absurdity of years of appeals with hundreds on death row . It holds the ' judici  --  ary up to ridicule . But that is no reason to kill a man . The reason death cases drone on in our courts is that America no longer has the will for capital punishment . If we executed one person each working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the backlog . We will not do it . And as the anguish increases it will become clear that equal protection of the laws is not possible with the death penalty . We will not even afford the accused , nearly always impoverished , the price of an adequate defense . It will be the capricious cases , Gary Gilmore with a desire to die , John Spenkelink denied due process , that result in death .
