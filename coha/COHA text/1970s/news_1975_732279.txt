txt Improved economic news for U.S. consumers is expected in 1976 ? but the new year 's outlook is not as upbeat as the latest wholesale price index would indicate , economic analysts say . In November the government index of wholesale prices was unchanged after adjustment for seasonal factors , which was a signal to some that inflationary pressures were easing . The report 's food price component declined sharply while the more stable industrial commodities section rose at half October 's rate . But the apparent stability of November wholesale prices is " in a way as misleading " as the previous month 's report when the index was rising at a 21.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate , says First National City Bank economist Allan P. Murray . A truer indication of the U.S. inflation rate would be " somewhere in the middle " of the two price reports , he says , a view shared by forecasters at the nation 's three major economic forecasting firms . The firms ? Chase Econometric Associates , Data Resources , Inc . ( DRI ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs to forecast economic activity . Consumers ' living cost will climb between 5 and 61/2 percent during 1976 , according to City Bank projecticns . Estimates at the three forecasting firms put inflation 's bite at between 6 and 7.2 percent during 1976 , as measured by the consumer price index . // * U.S. inflation still a pesky factor for ' 76 // DRI 's forecast indicates that the increase in consumer prices could be as low as 6 percent in 1976 . But the firm is " realistically looking " for inflation to be closer to-the 7 percent " high side " of its consumer price index prediction , says staff economist Eril Herr . This forecast is in line with the November wholesale price index report on consumer finished goods ? those products ready to move into the retail market . They rose in price at a 6 percent annual pace in November . While the forecasting firms expect the pace of inflation to be slower next year than it was in 1975 , a less hopeful view is taken by the ational Association of Purchasing Managerdent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey of purchasing agents , group executive E. F. Andrews says he expects a return to a 10 percent rate of inflation during the coming year because of improved business conditions and stimulative government policy in an election year . Chase Econometrics expects inflation to be about 7.2 percent in 1976 , but it sees an increase in 1977 with the consumer price index moving up at a 7.7 annual rate , says Chase official Joe Chapman , marking " the onset of trouble with inflation . " The latest government data found wholesale prices in November 3.7 percent higher than a year ago . In November , 1974 , wholesale prices were 23.5 percent above the previous year 's end . Forecasters note that there are a number of factors clouding the wholesale price picture for the coming months , including seasonal adjustment problems and the pace of fuel-price increase passthroughs .
