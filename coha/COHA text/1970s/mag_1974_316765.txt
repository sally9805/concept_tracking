CAMPAIGN ' 74/COVER STORY <P> " The election was only the beginning . If we do n't perform , we 'll be held accountable-and we should be . " <P> - Democratic National Committee Chairman Robert Strauss <P> Democrats could have danced all night , and some of them did , as the champagne corks popped and the band played on in hotels and headquarters across the nation on Nov. 5 . But on the morning after their sweeping election victories , most Democrats recognized that they had received no mandate from the American electorate . Because of Watergate and the economy , voters either protested by staying home or indicated with their ballots that at this particular point in the life of the country , they surely loved Republicans the less but not necessarily Democrats the more . <P> Even if no one could be sure whether the people had spoken or merely cleared their throats , the expanded Democratic majorities in the House and Senate forced on the party the challenge - and the burden-of coming up with answers to inflation , recession and the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act decisively over the next two years , they could in turn become the victims of voter rebellion and dissatisfaction with the way they are being governed . Declared Minnesota Senator Walter F. Mondale , a possible candidate for President in 1976 : " The heat 's on us now . " <P> Public Outrage . Thus for Democrats , last week 's euphoria was short-lived , even though they had scored their greatest mid-term election triumph since 1958 . In the House , they apparently increased their control by 43 seats , to a total of 291 , or one more than the two-thirds required to override vetoes . In the Senate , they added three seats - and possibly four , depending on the outcome of the close race in North Dakota-to their existing majority of 58 . Further , the Democrats wrested nine statehouses from Republicans , while giving up only four of their own , not including Alaska , where the race was still unresolved . That meant that Democrats will govern at least 36 states , including eight of the ten most populous . Democrats also gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 36 . No wonder that when one top adviser to President Gerald Ford was asked for his reaction to the election results , his response was to gulp down a bicarbonate of soda . Two other White House aides tried to come up with some heartening words for reporters , then glumly agreed on the obvious : " Just say that we took a beating . " <P> The direct causes of that beating were easily stated , indeed inescapable : the public outrage over Watergate , Ford 's pardon of Richard Nixon , double-digit inflation and worsening unemployment . These overriding issues coalesced to shape a generally sour mood on the part of voters that contributed either to the defeat of Republican incumbents or to the narrowness of many of their victories , whatever the quantity of purely local concerns .
