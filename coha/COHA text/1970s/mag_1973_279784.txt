" Dressed in a dark blue suit and a blue and white striped shirt with matching handkerchief , Gough Whitlam looked like everyone 's friendly neighborhood banker , " TIME Sydney Bureau Chief Ed Ogle reported after an interview with the Australian Prime Minister . " When I told him that my first question was going to be about the future of Australia , he flashed a grin and quipped to his press secretary : ' Quick , get my papers on that . ' But it was obvious as the interview progressed that Gough Whitlam needed no papers on Australia 's future-or anything else . " <P> <P> ON AUSTRALIA 'S ROLE IN ASIA : There are no countries that display greater disparity in economic development than Australia and her neighbors . Australia certainly can and should do a certain amount toward decreasing this disparity . We have a Gross National Product equal to that of all the countries between the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea . Those countries have 20 times our population . Developing the resources of these countries is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , that is , a generation . <P> The other great theme our government will wish to stress is that with the end of foreign intervention in Viet Nam , the region has a second chance . The West threw away an opportunity for a settlement in 1954 , after Geneva . I believe the U.S. , the Soviet Union , Japan and China are determined not to let the second opportunity slip . We shall support the proposal for a zone of peace and neutrality in Southeast Asia . <P> ON CHANGES IN FOREIGN POLICY : Regional cooperation will be one of the keystones of Australia 's foreign policy for the ' 70s . We shall be charting a new course with less emphasis on military pacts . It will be based on an independent outlook in foreign affairs and will be directed toward a new regional community to help free the region of the great power rivalries that have bedeviled its progress for decades . <P> ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. : We have expressed opposition to Australia 's military involvement in Viet Nam , yet our mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This we will do . But friendship does not require Australia to be subservient . <P> ON THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY : This is the big problem for Australia now . Our secondary industry is increasingly dominated by overseas companies and multinational corporations , creating the danger that our internal development and external trade outlets will be controlled by foreign countries . But we are not going to be inhospitable to capital . We simply intend to set up certain rules-a reasonable return for raw materials we sell , reasonable opportunities for processing these raw materials in Australia . <P> ON TRADE WITH CHINA : Per head of population , China will remain one of the smallest trading countries in the world . Where the U.S. went wrong in its revulsion against the change of government in China-and where Australia went wrong in America 's wake-was in believing that China was internationally an aggressive country . It never has been . It is n't now . I do n't foresee that it will be . It is an amazingly docile country . More than any country in the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own borders .
