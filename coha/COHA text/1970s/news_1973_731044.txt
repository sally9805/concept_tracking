txt IT WAS a springtime Sunday morning . and Leroy Watts was on his knees in an empty apartment , pleading for his life . nis - tor mer landlord , Patrolman Maurice Beachem , was off duty and in his black leather jacket , and he had just shot Watts in the chest and stomach . " Mr. Beachem , " Leroy Watts implored , " if you 'll just let me get up , I 'll go away . " " If you get up , I 'll kill you , " Beachem told him . Watts struggled to his feet and ran into the next room , with Beachem following . He shot Watts in the left arm . . Watts stumbled into still another room . and Beachem shot him in the right hand . They were in Watts ' former apartment in a building owned by Beachem . That was April 29 , and Beachem was angry because Watts had left some plastic bags filled with trash sitting in the kitchen when he moved the night before . THE POLICE Department has an impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policemen in Chicago . The vast majority are dedicated , honorable , and courageous . But some have abused their powers and the rights of citizens they are sworn to protect . During a five-month investigation , Tribune reporters talked to hundreds of alleged victims and witnesses , interviewed policemen , searched thru documents , and arranged dozens of polygraph tests . This is the second in a series compiled by George Bliss , chief investigator , and reporters Pamela Zckman . William Mullen , and Emmett George . polygraph tests that show that Patrolman Beachem willfully shot Watts . But Beachem still goes to work every day as a policeman , and Watts tho alive , is still recovering from his wounds and unable to work . And it is Watts , not Beachem , who is facing criminal charges of aggravated battery . In Chicago , a policeman is a policeman for 24 hours a day , under orders to carry his gun at all times , empowered to make arrests under any circumstances . That is the Police Department 's rule , and it is probably a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . At the same time , it is an awful responsibility to the individual policeman as he lives his private life . He has ' his badge and gun and the awesome power of the law  --  a power he can abuse and use to . protect himself if he should get into trouble while acting as a private citizen . DURING A five-month investigation , Tribune reporters talked to hundreds of alleged victims of . police brutality , and many of them told of violent encounters with policemen during their off-duty hours . The reporters tracked down witnesses , examined supportive documents , and arranged polygraph tests to substantiate the stories of victims . The investigation showed that a brutal policeman 's instincts do not disappear when he ends his shift . The department had received complaints about Patrolman Beachem long before he shot Leroy Watts . Some of them had come from tenants who started moving out of his building soon after he bought it last year . They described him as a swaggering despot who kept his service revolver on his hip and visible even when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , sought a court injunction against Beachem while she lived in his building . She asked for an order to stop Beachem from harassing her and her family . Mrs. Burks had an apartment across the hall from Leroy Watts , a man she described as quiet , hardworking , and devoted to his family . She was in her apartment the day Watts was shot , and she heard him begging for his life . She moved from the building after that . Ironically , Watts himself said he had n't had much trouble with Beachem until the day he was shot . He moved the Saturday his lease was up to a larger apartment down the street simply because he needed a bigger place . The morning after he moved , Watts was on his way to the store for some milk when Beachem stopped him and demanded to know where he had left the keys to the old apartment . Watts told him they were hanging in the living room , and when Beachem asked him to go with him to find them , Watts agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My wife and I left some plastic bags full of trash in the kitchen because we filled all the garbage cans outside , " Watts said . " He started fussing ? about the trash and told me to take it out . " He said he tried to explain that the plastic bags were neatly piled and tied for easy removal and there was no reason for Beachem to raise his voice . " HE SAID he was ready to die over this , " Watts said . " I thought he was teasing . I did n't know he had a gun . " " You think you 're real slick , " he said Beachem told him . For several moments , the two men stared tensely at each other in the stillness of the empty place . Then , as Watts turned to go out the door , he said , Beachem kicked the door shut . " I turned around to see what he was doing " Watts said , " and I turned right into a bullet in my chest . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank or something . " Beachem , he said , ordered him to get on his knees . " Then he shot me in the stomach and I felt that , and I saw the blood . " That 's when he started pleading for his life . MRS . BURKS heard the shots and stood petrified with fear behind her front door across the hall . " Let me go , Mr. Beachem , " she said be begged . " Let me go . " The voices kept getting closer , she said , and the shots kept ringing out , until she heard them in the hallway . Several squad cars arrived , and she opened the door . Beachem was standing over Watts in the hallway with a gun in one hand and a butcher knife in the other . Beachem told The Tribune that Watts bad attempted to stab him after he asked Watts to remove the plastic bags from the kitchen . " When I asked him to clean it up , " he said , " he Watts struck at me with his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and I went dawn . " Beachem said he pulled his revolver and struck Watts on the head . They started scuffling , he said , and Watts pulled the knife . They went from room to room as they struggled , and finally tumbled into the hallway . " I WAS DOWN and he was standing over me , " Beachem said . " I fired . " Watts said he never saw the knife Beachem claimed he had pulled . Indeed , when the police confiscated the butcher knife Beachem was reported to be holding , they went thru Watts ' pockets and found his small unopened pocket knife . Watts was in critical condition for several weeks after the shooting , and several months passed before he was able to take a polygraph test . ' The result of those tests , taken Oct. 4 , support Watts ' story that he did n't threaten Beachem with a knife or knock him down . In fact , a ballistics study of the bullet wound in Watts ' stomach indicates the slug entered in a downward fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fired . After Beachem took the polygraph test , the police Internal Affairs Division quickly sustained Watts ' c ase and recommended firing Beachem from the force when it learned The Tribune was investigating the incident .
