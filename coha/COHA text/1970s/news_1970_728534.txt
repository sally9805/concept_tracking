txt Apollo 13 was cleared today for launching here tomorrow afternoon with a substitute pilot in the spacecraft 's center seat for the nation 's third manned mission to the moon . The decision was made after John L. Swigert Jr. , the civilian back-up pilot , demonstrated in intensive training sessions yesterday and today that he was able to fill in on short notice for Lieut . Comdr . Thomas K. Mattingly 2d , who is threatened with the German measles . The launching is set for 2:13 P.M. Eastern standard time . All countdown preparations were reported to be proceeding smoothly . The weather  --  predicted scattered clouds , a slight possibility of showers but no threat of storms  --  appeared to pose no threat to ' the lift-off of the United Press International John L. Swigert Jr . Apollo spacecraft atop the 36-story Saturn 5 rocket . Mr. Swigert was named to the crew today by Dr. Thomas O. Paine , administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , who consulted with Capt . James A. Lovell Jr . of the Navy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I talked was // unanimous that Apollo 13 be launched tomorrow , " Dr. Paine said at a news conference here . If the decision had been to postpone the lift-off , Apollo 12 would have been delayed for a month until Commander Mattingly could fly and the lighting conditions at the landing Fite on the moon would again be favorable . Such a postponement would have cost at least $800,000 in added overtime for launching crews , refueling operations and the redeployment of recovery forces . The crew change was made necessary when another backup pilot , Maj. Charles M. Duke of the Air Force , developed Berman measles last weekend , axposing all the astronauts to the disease . Of the three primary crew members , only Commander Mattingly proved not to be immune to the highly infectious virus disease . Maneuvers Simulated ' After working with Mr. Swigert on simulations of key mission maneuvers , Captain Lovell was convinced that the rookie astronaut could mesh with him and Fred W. Haise Jr. , the third crewman , on the complex operations of the spacecraft . While Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovell and Mr. Haise , another civilian astronaut. intend to ride the four-legged landing craft to a pinpoint touchdown in a narrow valley of the moon among hills and craters , a rugged area that scientists believe may hold some of the most ancient rocks on the lunar surface . The landing , which will be in the Fra Mauro site , on the eastern shore of the Ocean of Storms , is scheduled for next Wednesday night , April 15 . Because of the hilly terrain , the landing is considered the most hazardous yet attempted by American astronauts . Late Substitution The moon explorers plan to set up a nuclear-powered scientific observatory , take a twomile geological field trip and transmit color television pictures during two scheduled excursions outside their landing craft . They ' are expected to be on the moon for 34 hours . Mission directors said that the crew change had made it necessary to omit some of the photography experiments in lunar orbit with which only Commander Mattingly was well-rehearsed . Mr. Swigert will attempt to photograph in detail possible future landing sites , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other shots of scientific value . At no time has a back-up pilot been pressed into flight duty in the last week of the countdown preparations . But Dr. Paine and other Apollo officials praised Mr. Swigert 's abiilties as an astronaut , recalling that he " wrote the book " on what procedures to follow in the case of command module malfunctions . Mr. Swigert has been training as a back-up pilot for eight months . Blood tests showed that he had immunity to German measles . At first Donald K. Slayton , director of flight crew operations , said he was doubtful that the crew substitution could be made in time for the launching tomorrow . Each team , in working to ? gether , develops its own style and idiosyncrasies , so that it is often difficult for a newcomer , no matter how skilled , to fit into the operation . In simulations , however , Mr. Swigert was said to work smoothly with Captain Lovell and Mr. Haise on such key maneuvers as the separation of the Saturn 5 rocket , the insertion into lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . the return from the lunar surface . " We were surprised that thcrew did integrate as well as they did , " Mr. Slayton said . Swigert Praised " When it comes to Jack 's Swigert 's mastery of the command module , " Dr. Paine said , " I do n't believe there is an astronaut in NASA who knows it any more thoruoghly . " The substitution could not have been made , however , if it had involved replacing the mission . commander or the lunar module pilot , Mr. Slayton said . They must work closely and with split-second timing during the lunar landing , while the command module pilot often works alone . Mr. Slayton described Mr. Swigert as " cool and calm " over the sudden prospect of going into space . Commander Mattingly was said o be " disappointed , " but was thought to be in line for another chance to fly to the moon on Apollo 16 in the position that Mr. Swigert would have held .

The final countdown phase , which involves fueling of the Saturn 5 rocket , is set to begin early tomorrow morning .
