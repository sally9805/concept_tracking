ELIZABETH BOWEN by Victoria Glendinning . Knopf ; 332 pages ; $12.50 <P> Author Elizabeth Bowen was born in 1899 and died in 1973 . The generous expanse of her life was even greater than the raw dates suggest . Her earliest years were spent in a social system that was virtually indistinguishable from feudalism . She was raised at Bowen 's Court , the family home in County Cork , Ireland , on land that had been in Bowen possession since 1653 . She spent her last years teaching in American colleges , living in rooms or rented apartments and listening to students worrying about the war in Viet Nam . At the end , her life had been touched directly by both Cromwell and Khe Sanh . <P> Along the way she had written ten novels , numerous short stories , essays and several travel books , winning for her work a respectful following both in Britain and the U.S. Biographer Victoria Glendinning , a British journalist who has lived in Ireland , argues passionately that Bowen is important , not only for her writings but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising , Bowen was destined to be the last of the Anglo-Irish writers , a lively breed that included Sheridan , Swift and Oscar Wilde . Bowen also brushed against Bloomsbury during her early years as a writer . Writes Glendinning : " She is the link that connects Virginia Woolf with Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark . " <P> Such follow-the-dots criticism invites rude noises . Glendinning is on safer ground when she ignores her own theories and simply tells the story of Elizabeth Bowen 's life . It is a fascinating tale . Elizabeth 's parents were perfectly matched in their weaknesses : dreamy , high-strung people for whom life proved to be too much . Her father had a nervous breakdown in 1905 , and her mother died in 1912 . Faced with all this , Elizabeth developed a strategy of " not noticing " and emerged into gawky adolescence with big hands , big feet , a stammer and pronounced nearsightedness . She married Alan Cameron , a World War I veteran and civil servant , and settled into a union that was long on affection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she wrote in 1935 , " all intended to marry early , partly because this appeared an achievement or way of making one 's mark , also from a feeling it would be difficult to settle to anything else until this was done . " <P> What Elizabeth settled after marriage was her career as a writer . She began writing short stories and , in remarkable time , had secured an influential patron ( Rose Macaulay ) , an agent and some small renown . London literary life in the 1920s was both glittering and , with the right connections , easy to crack . " Inconceivably , " Bowen wrote later , " I found myself in the same room as Edith Sitwell , Walter de la Mare , Aldous Huxley . . . "
