ARLA But I make artificial lemonade . p. 23 TREASURER ( exit ) Please stop . ( During the previous scene , ARLA and the TREASURER have walked around the revolve to arrive in ARLA 's lab . Or perhaps the revolve is n't working , so the lab appears during ARLA 's song . ) ARLA sings .

( ARLA pulls the watchdog away on its wheels , exposing a figure masked and gowned like a surgeon and working with fizzy chemicals at a lab bench . It is BUMBLE , as we might have guessed . ARLA does n't notice him and as he pulls the computer around . BUMBLE follows her - always just out of her sight . ) What is it , boy ? Is it Bumble ? Where is he , boy ? Go get him .
