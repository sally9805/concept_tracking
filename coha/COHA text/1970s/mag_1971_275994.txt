Machined Mosaics Every art show is an archive , but none more explicitly so than the retrospective now at London 's Tate Gallery . It runs from elaborate silk-screen prints dedicated to Wittgenstein to a giant chrome-plated combat boot ; from a stack of bombs to a sprawling collection of clippings , toys , scraps and Mickey Mouse emblems hoarded by the artist over the past 30 years . It has all been assembled by Sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi , 47 , an amiable , lowering Scottish-Italian with lobster-claw hands and the build of a robot . The show , a melange of art work and subject matter , represents Paolozzi 's two decades of involvement with Masscult . <P> The uneasy relationship between technology and " fine art " has become a crucial problem for artists over the past 20 years .

Indeed , the split itself has become a form of subject matter , and few men have made use of it more steadfastly than Paolozzi .

Massculture artifacts are common coin in gallery art today ; they were not so when Paolozzi , working in Paris , produced a whole series of collages scissored from American magazines-cover blondes from pulp thrillers , bombers and Jell-O from LIFE . Fifteen years ahead of time he predicted the grotesque iconography of lushness , repetition and violence that American artists would eventually discover in their own culture .

" One of his collages , from 1948 , contains the word POP issuing from the barrel of a gun : a prediction that amuses Paolozzi today . " People sometimes say that I missed the boat , that I should have made a career out of Pop art . But I was never keen on it . I felt there should be more to it than simple artifacts , consumer goods ; and I 'm still more interested in making layers of paradox and irony . " <P>
