The nation got along quite nicely without the national pastime last week , thank you . Taxes were paid , elections won , gangsters shot . It was business as usual , except of course for major league baseball , an enterprise that seemed to be taxing its own dubious instinct for survival . // Despite the players ' strike , which forced postponement of all games , a Florida newspaper , the Orlando Sentinel , printed a box score for what would have been the Opening Day game between Cincinnati and Houston . All players were shown to have no at bats , no runs , no hits and no RBIs . The symbolism was obvious : baseball had shut itself out , pitched itself a big fat goose egg . // What was particularly poignant in all of this was that the issues that separated management and labor  --  mismanagement and non-labor ?  --  seemed too intramural to arouse much passion among the paying public . Were the owners , by refusing to enrich an already generous pension plan , really pressing a crown of thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their inestimable avarice , really setting out to rob the robber barons ? Viewed as a matter either way of the rich getting measurably richer , apathy could be the only response . // The players steadfastly insisted that money was not the issue in their grievance with the owners , but the survival of their association as an effective bargaining agent . The owners , they said , were not out to save money so much as they were intent on humiliating the association and weakening the authority of its executive director , the redoubtable Marvin Miller . Miller has said he did not counsel a strike vote but that when it came he was proud of the fledgling unionists who had the courage to stand up to " the 24 multimillionaires who control this game . " The owners replied that they would not be investing more than $5 million in benefits for members of a union they were trying to bust . The players , they said , had been led astray by the Svengali , Miller . And lurking in the shadows , rustling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault on the reserve clause . // So the sports pages read like financial pages , and the public yawned . Actuarial studies ... outside arbitration ... cost-of-living increases ... available funds ... federal mediation .... Is this the language of diversion ? What has any of this to do with playing ball ? Only the very naive would suggest that professional sports be more sporting than professional , but for the impatient fan enough was enough . // The only noneconomic baseball story of the week was a melancholy one : the funeral of Met manager and former Dodger hero Gil Hodges . Afterward , the Mets showed there was some sentiment  --  and perhaps a little wisdom  --  left in the business by hiring as Hodges ' successor Yogi Berra . The Mets also completed a trade with Montreal that Hodges initiated  --  the Mets ' Tim Foli , Mike Jorgensen and Ken Singleton for Rusty Staub. // Staub himself proved to be a sentimentalist . He was sorry , he said , to be leaving his good friends in Montreal . " I 've never been accepted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a person . It 's been the best three years of my life . " The bodies might be gone , but maybe there was still some soul left in the game . // Where , indeed , were the bodies ? Most of the players returned to the cities where they lived or where they hoped eventually to play . Things being what they were last week , they all exercised informally . // Lou Brock of the Cardinals and Luis Aparicio of the Red Sox worked out with their sons  --  Brock and son in St. Louis , Aparicio and son in Maracaibo , Venezuela . Pete Rose of the Reds worked out with the team from his old high school . Chris Cannizzaro of the Dodgers worked out with the Padres in San Diego , where he lives , and Vada Pinson of the Angels worked out with the A 's in Oakland , where he lives . // Mickey Lolich of the Tigers worked out on his motorcycle . Riding through gravel pits and gullies , says Lolich , " is great for the legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out of bats and balls . " We only had two bats to start with , " said Pitcher Cecil Upshaw , " and we broke both of those the second day . On top of that , Henry Aaron hit all our balls into the trees and we lost them . It 's hard to practice without any bats and balls . " // The Pirates also worked out together . Almost . The exception was Pitcher Dock Ellis , who told Manager Bill Virdon that practicing with the rest of the team was " kowtowing to management . " " I do think , " said Virdon , " that Dock is working out on his own someplace . " That presumably is what Dick Allen of the White Sox is doing . Allen , who missed all of spring training , signed his 1972 contract the day the strike was called and has been missing since . // The Reds were playing basketball , which is hardly kowtowing to management , this being a game much in disfavor with the Cincinnati hierarchy since Centerfielder Bobby Tolan tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last season . The Orioles were also playing basketball , as well as paddle ball , a game that has had a bad name in Baltimore since Colt Quarterback Johnny Unitas tore his Achilles ' tendon a year ago playing it . // The Dodgers were playing soft ball . Their game against a team of Los Angeles disc jockeys somehow attracted an estimated 8,000 fans into Casey Stengel Field in beautiful downtown Glendale . The Dodgers batted cross-handed , threw wrong-handed and ran to some strange bases . Frank Robinson fell down under an imaginary pop fly . The score was 8-8 . The Dodgers are obviously in mid-season form . // Willie Mays of the Giants showed up at Candlestick Park to collect some equipment so he could work out and was summarily rebuffed by a clubhouse attendant who did n't recognize him . Willie Mays. // Gary Nolan of the Reds was recognized , to his embarrassment , in a Cincinnati restaurant at lunch one day . " Get out of here , Nolan ! " a diner shouted . " Remember what we did to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan support that caused the National Basketball Association team to flee Cincinnati for Kansas City . And Nolan 's teammate , Johnny Bench , was recognized on the golf course by an old business friend who wanted to complain to him about the inequities of his own pension plan . Bench did not tip his cap . // In Anaheim one fan was organizing his own union  --  the United Baseball Fans of America  --  which will contest such critical issues as rising ticket prices , fan comfort , quality of play and ... players ' strikes . " The only way the club owners and the ballplayers are going to recognize the view of the fans , " a UBFA statement read , " is through united action of the people who are actually paying the bills . " // Jackie Jensen , who won the American League 's Most Valuable Player award 14 years ago , is not a member of the fans ' union , but he was assuredly with it in spirit . // " There are now 26 players getting over $100,000 , " said Jensen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe that all of them are worth it . But I 'll tell you one thing : if any fan , including me , goes out to a ball game to see a $100,000 guy play , I expect him to be a super-super player . ... I think playing baseball is a privilege . I enjoyed it , and it was a game to me . It does n't look like it is anymore . And if it is n't , it is n't going to be much from here on in  --  either to the fans or the players . And I think that 's a tragedy . " // A gloomy and melodramatic forecast , perhaps . When the players return , the fans will be there . But Jensen may be right : they may be looking at the game a little differently . // That may not be tragic , but it is a little sad .
