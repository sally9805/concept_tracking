As millions of children go back to school this week , a distressingly high proportion of them will fail an important medical test . Though effective , safe and usually free vaccines are readily available , these children have no protection against at least four common , communicable and dangerous diseases . <P> In New York , for example , State Health Commissioner Robert P. Whalen reports that about 20% of the 300,000 children due to enter first grade have not been immunized against polio , measles or rubella . Most of them are not even protected against diphtheria , the vaccine for which is included in the three-way D.T.P . ( diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis ) shots that have long been standard treatment for all infants . In some areas , Whalen says , less than half of the entering class have been immunized . There have been similar or even greater drop-offs in vaccinations among preschool children in most other states . <P> Proved Protection . Whatever the cause-parental overconfidence , carelessness or ignorance-the situation may well lead to a comeback by diseases that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines became available , the number of U.S. cases of that crippling and often fatal disease has fallen from a peak of 58,000 in 1952 to a mere seven in 1974 . Common or " red " measles ( rubeola ) used to strike 4 million children a year , kill 400 and leave 800 with irreparable brain damage . By last year , the total number of cases was down to 22,000 ; only a handful had serious consequences . Much the same is true of German measles ( rubella ) , the crippler of the fetus during pregnancy . From a high of 58,000 reported cases ( far below the true total ) in 1969 , the number of rubella cases dropped to 12,000 last year , and only 45 infants were born with resulting deformities . Smallpox , dreaded and widespread as recently as 1930 , is virtually nonexistent today ; as a result , smallpox inoculations , once routine , are seldom given . <P> Massive vaccination programs are costly : immunizing 60 million children against common measles between 1963 and 1972 cost the Federal Government about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The investment , say Dr. John J. Witte and Norman W. Axnick , both of the U.S. Center for Disease Control , has not only saved immeasurable suffering , mental crippling and death , but has also produced a saving of $1.3 billion over ten years . As they figure it , besides the 24 million cases of measles averted , 2,400 lives were saved , 7,900 cases of retardation prevented , 709,000 years of productive life made possible , and there were 78 million school days , 12 million physician visits and 1,352,000 hospital days saved . <P> One cause of the current parental apathy and neglect , New York 's Commissioner Whalen suggests , is that many of today 's preschoolers have mothers who are too young to have been aware of the great polio panics of the early 1950s , or of the fetus-crippling rubella epidemics of the early ' 60s . In ethnic ghettos , poverty , illiteracy and language barriers are also factors .
