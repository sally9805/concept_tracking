txt ' Oh , God . " murmurs Sandra Karales. 14 . " Mu stomach 's doing Itiv-dons ! " " Shhhh ! " Stage manager Dave Eaton hisses . " Hold it down . This is the real thing , here we go . Places , everybody . Places ! " The cast of York High School 's production of " No , No , Nanette " crowds nervously in the wings and gives a collective gasp at the sound of the orchestra 's first flourish . And then another gasp as the curtain goes up and a swelling roar of applause drowns out the music . " Oh . oh , wow ! " a faint voice squeals . " Oh , wow , listen to it . Listen to it ! " THE OLD HIGH school play is not what It used to be  --  a gloriously amateurish funfest for adolescent hams mare interested in cast parties than in performing . High school productions today have taken on a most remarkably professional tinge , from the tickets to the tap dancing . They are big-budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best big-city productions . There are dancers at Maine South in Park Ridge who can can do hitch kicks , shimmies , and grapevine walks with flawless elan . There are singers at Elmhurst 's York High who belt ' em out like Barbra Streisand . The- orchestra at New Trier East in Winnetka could take over the pit at most Chicago theaters  --  and audiences could hardly tell the difference . " The voices are a little more mature , and the people arc a little taller , but that 's about all the difference between pros and these kids , " said B. K. Sicwerth , technical director of Evanston Township High School 's production of " The Music Man . " " A FAIR NUMBER of these kids might be pros one of these days , " Siewerth added . " There 's a good bit of professional desire among them , not only in performing . but in things like set design and production . Besides the musical , they do a variety show every year where they do all the writing and all the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive for professionalism extends to every level at schools like Evanston and York . Even the tickets and playbills are professionally printed . Backstage can be found all the sights , sounds , and smells of Broadway : greasepaint , talc , sweat , and the peculiar language of show folk . The York High School orchestra leads in to the first big chorus number and Eugenia Konen , 17 , an assistant prop head , turns to the singers . " Smile ! " she barks . " C'm on , paste a smile on there . put it on and keep it on ! " The nervous chorus complies , fixed grins belying the warm sweat on the palms of their hands . " Okay . here we go . " Eugenia says , and she adds the traditional show-biz good luck wish : " Break a leg ! " IF THE HIGH schools can boast professional-level talent in their shows , then they can also boast professional budgets . York spent about $8,000 on " No , No . Nanette , " and just managed to break even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent nearly that much on " Music Man , " and New Trier East budgeted about $13,000 on its production of " Fiddler on the Roof , " with ticket sales paying the tab for both schools . But the grandest of the high school musical budgets this year is the $51,000 to be spent on the Chicago all-city high school theatrical troupe when it performs Rodgers and Hammerstein 's " Carousel " next month . Irving M. Stein of the faculty staff said the costs are greater because of an eight-night run in a professional theater which has rental charges and union employes . He said the troupe will get $20,000 in ticket sales , plus $9,000 from the state . THAT IS NOT enough , of course , but like the Broadway big time some " angels " came forward to save the day . Stein said one anonymous donor will provide 020,000 to help cover deficits , and another is paying $3,000 to print the programs . " Without those angels , there 'd be no show , " Stein said . One reason for the high cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publishers of the musicals , usually about $250 a performance . Since " Carousel " will run eight nights , royalties will hit $2,000 . Other costs include such sophisticated items as cordless microphones , quality makeup , and even professional costumes . EVEN AT SCHOOLS where the students make their own costumes the expenses can be high , because the casts arc enormous . At York . director Les Zunkel auditioned about 350 hopefuls before he chose a final cast of 143 ? not counting the orchestra and stage crews . Casts at other schools also average about 100 , and directors often - double- cast " the lead roles  --  different performers on alternate nights  --  to give more students a chance to star . To cut costume costs , schools call in the help of community volunteers , like Mrs. Bonnie Moore of Elmhurst who stitched 70 party dresses for York 's production even tho she has no children in it . Backstage crews design and build all of their own sets , but costs of building materials have skyrocketed and ticket prices for some performances are going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Julie Janney , 17 , paces quietly , deep in eoncentration . She is playing Nanette  --  her first lead  --  but she says she is not nervous . Not yet . " I usually get a little touch ' of stage fright just as I go on , but it goes away as 3007L as I speak my first line , " she says . Her cue is coming up and she moves into position to go on . She tugs nervously at a glove , intent and unsmiling . She hears her cue and her face flashes into a smile as she strides onstage to become chattering , childish Nanette . IF TILE ROAD to success in show business seems rough , Chicago-area high school students have reason to believe the pavement may be smoother for them . The drama and music curricula at the best of the local schools arc the envy of most colleges . At Maine South , students can choose among 24 courses in speech , drama , and debate , plus nearly as many in music . The school has 600 music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came here nine years ago from Miami ( University of Ohio , " said Don Iartello , who is the faculty technical director for this spring 's production . " The program here is better than Miami 's , and I would n't go back to college level for the world . " HE SAID Maine South does seven major stage shows every year , and always makes money . " Last year we sold out in a week for Tiddler ' , " he said . " Lots of people want us to do more , and we could . But we think it would begin to be disruptive of the school schedule , and after all , these kids are n't pros . Not yet , anyway . " Some , he said , have gone from Maine South 's stage to much bigger and better things . Carol Oleck , a 1963 graduate , is currently in the five-member cast of " What 's a Nice Country Like You Doing in a State Like This ? " at Chicago 's Happy Medium . " I got started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great people , and they give their students a serious approach to theater as an art form . That 's the most important thing they can do . " Of all the Chicago-area high schools , New Trier East is regarded as the show-biz powerhouse , It has been doing a lavish spring musical for 53 years , and some of the productions are legendary . So are some of the graduates . Ralph Bellamy graduated from New Trier in 1921 . Later grads include Rock Hudson , Charlton Heston , and Ann-Margret . At York High , the full cast is onstage at the finale to receive a standing ovation . Julie Janney takes bow after bow as the ovation rolls over her , and she flushes with pleasure and triumph . No matter that the cheers are those of moms and dads and grandparents and aunts and classmates . No matter that this is York High School , and not the Goodman or the Shubert . It is applause , and Julie loves it . She worked for it . And who can tell ? Maybe this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
