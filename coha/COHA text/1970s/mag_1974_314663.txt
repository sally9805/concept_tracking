. . . As I pointed out last night , I 'm sure we 've done some things wrong in this Administration . And the top man always takes the responsibility and I 've never ducked it . But I want to say one thing : We can be proud of you . In five and a half years , no man or no woman came into this Administration and left it with more of this world 's goods than he came in . No man or no woman ever profited at the public expense , or the public till . That tells something about you . Mistakes , yes . But for personal gain , never . You did what you believed in , sometimes right , sometimes wrong , and I only wish that I were a wealthy man-ha ! At the present time I 've got to find a way to pay my taxes . And if I were , I 'd like to recompense you for the sacrifices that all of you have made to serve in government . . . <P> You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell my kids . You know , they look at government . It 's sort of a rugged life and they see the mistakes that are made . They get the impression that everybody is here for the purpose of feathering his nest . That 's why I made this earlier point . Not in this Administration . Not one single man or woman . <P> And I say to them there are many fine careers . This country needs good farmers , good businessmen , good plumbers , good carpenters . I remember my old man . I think that they would have called him sort of a little man , common man . He did n't consider himself that way . Know what he was ? He was a streetcar motorman first . And then a farmer . And then he had a lemon ranch . It was the poorest lemon ranch in California , I can assure you . He sold it before they found oil on it laughter . And then he was a grocer . But he was a great man , because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of what happens . <P> Nobody 'll ever write a book , probably , about my mother . Well , I guess all of you would say this about your mother-my mother was a saint . . . Yes , she will have no books written about her . But she was a saint . Now , however , we look to the future . <P> I had a little quote in the speech last night from T.R. Theodore Roosevelt . As you know , I like to read books . I 'm not educated , but I do read books laughter . . . There 's another quote I found as I was reading my last night in the White House . . . He 'd married a beautiful girl and they had a lovely daughter . And then suddenly she Roosevelt 's wife died . This is what he wrote . . . <P> " And when my heart 's dearest died , the light went from my life forever . " <P> That was T.R. in his 20s . He thought the light had gone from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only became President , but as an ex-President he served his country , always in the arena , tempestuous , strong , sometimes right . But he was a man . And as I leave , let me say that 's an example I think all of us should remember . . .
