Feminists lament at a caucus in San Jose <P> " The woman 's movement is in trouble , " boomed C. Delores Tucker , secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . " We have lost direction and are mired in disunity . " Few of her listeners at last week 's biennial meeting of the National Women 's Political Caucus in San Jose , Calif. , were inclined to disagree . For the faltering feminist movement , 1977 has been a discouraging year . The Supreme Court ruling that states no longer have to spend Medicaid funds on elective abortions for the poor was an unexpected blow . The Equal Rights Amendment is stalled just three states short of ratification , and conservative anti-feminist forces are picking up strength in their fight against federally funded day care centers , ERA and other women 's programs . The San Jose meeting echoed with sour charges of " betrayal , " " desertion " and " ego tripping . " <P> Who is responsible for the feminists ' woes ? Among those blamed were President Carter , the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complained San Jose Vice Muyor Susanne Wilson : " We do n't have real politics . It is not the politics of individuals but of institutions that men have created . " Said Gloria Steinem : " Women are beginning to get very cynical about this . It is n't a crisis of the women 's movement . It 's a crisis of democracy . " <P> One concern was a feeling of being abandoned by the press . " Let them move on to their next thing , " said Jill Ruckleshaus , former head of the U.S. International Women 's Year Commission . " They 've done us no good . " Boston University Professor Sally Lunt dramatically accused the press of " gearing up for a women-against-women bloodbath " at this fall 's National Women 's Conference in Houston . <P> Behind that statement is the fear that things could go poorly for feminists in Houston . Antiabortionists , members of the Total Woman movement and other conservatives have elected between 15% and 20% of the state delegates to the meeting . The Ku Klux Klan claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt the meeting . Summed up one delegate : " It 's kind of a reverse ' 60s , with the regressive forces threatening to disrupt us . " But Liz Carpenter , Lady Bird Johnson 's former press secretary and now a top leader in the ERA drive , had a soothing prediction : " Houston is not going to be a bad scene . We are going to emerge realizing we want the same things . " <P> Steinem told the 1,500 delegates that the movement is just one victim of the burgeoning radical right . " The efficiently organized opposition to the women 's movement , " she said , " is simply an early warning system of a total right-wing attack on civil rights , gun control , unions and social legislation .
