For the past five years , the handsome , boyish King of the Hellenes has languished in comfortable Roman exile . When not taking correspondence courses in political science from Cambridge University , he has spent much of his time playing wretched rounds of golf ( with balls supplied by Richard Nixon ) or sailing in an assured , near professional style ( he was an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 ) . Deadly serious about his future , King Constantine , 33 , has conscientiously kept up with Greek politics since the failure of a 1967 attempt to oust the junta forced him to flee his homeland . <P> Despite the benefit of a $580,000 annual allowance provided by the junta . Constantine has kept a deliberately low profile in Rome . The King , his pretty , temperamental Danish-born wife , Queen Anne-Marie , 26 , and their three small children live in a modest but handsomely situated rented villa on the Via di Porta Latina .

The royal family is descended from a Danish prince of the House of **40;1756;TOOLONG , who was installed by Russia , France and Britain on the throne in 1863 , as King George I. Since Constantine 's exile , there has been occasional speculation that he might eventually give up his Roman villa and join his wife 's family in Denmark . But , says a friend , " if he moved into a palace in Copenhagen , it would look too much like a permanent exile . He wants to make it look as if he 's ready to go back to Athens any time . " <P> At week 's end that seemed like a faint prospect indeed . Nonetheless , Constantine-no intellectual , but politically sharp-is well aware that Greece 's royal family has been deposed , exiled and recalled several times .
