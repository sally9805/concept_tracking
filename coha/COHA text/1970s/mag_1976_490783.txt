Notes and Comment WHILE waiting for the Third Avenue bus one sweltering day last week , we tipped back our head to look up at the sky . On terraces high on the apartment houses that line up hack of Bloomingdal.e 's  --  the sort of buildings that look like multi-story refrigerators  --  flimsy trees were bending themselves in silhouette before a sullen , thundery breeze . Their potted stab at tropical drama could not alter our long-held opinion that nature must surely he more subdued and self-effacing in this part of town than anywhere else on the planet ; leaf and branch always wear a vaguely neurotic air when they show up here , as though they were prey to anxiety about whether they can sustain themselves in any meaningful relationship with the elements , or were smarting at being ordered sight unseen and lovelessly by fashionable decorators . Then , out of the corner of our eye , we caught an impression of swooping and spiralling flight . We lowered our gaze to a horizontal pipe fixed high on the lamppost at the intersection one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire stays of the traffic lights are fastened  --  and were in time to catch the purposeful disappearing dart of a clearly nest-bound bird . The bird and its mate came and went several times before the bus arrived , and we had time to wonder at the thoroughly urban-ghetto quality of their nesting place . The inside of the metal shelter must have heated up horribly in this year 's quick summer , and scarcely any environment could have been less congenial than the environment outside the tube to the current demented forag ings of the parents or the eventual excursions of their not yet streetwise chicks . The occupants of this ornithological tenement must have been tormented by the rhythmic mechanical clickings of the WALK-DONT WALK sign that shared the pole below them , and mystified by the unchanging moon of the street lamp that arched out above . All through relentless nights , the nursery must have been lit up by a sodium glow and subjected to a never-ending stream of instructions to pedestrians who were home and comfortably asleep in the air-conditioned dark .

Ntozake Shange 's poetry is mordantly witty , unpredictable , and disciplined . It has to do with love and death and the deepest feelings of young women  --  in particular , black young women . We met her last week in a restaurant near the theatre , on whose stage she herself appears as one of the seven members of the all-black cast . We ordered coffee .

I spent seven months in Harlem last year , to-ward the end of the year , and I was very depressed . Mostly , I remember not the staircase or the sofa or the toilet down the hail but the three locks on my door . Three locks ! My mind drifts back to other places  --  happier places . St. Louis has a hold on me . I lived there from about age eight to age thirteen , and it has great meaning ? the jumping-off place to the West , the place from which runaway slaves might reach freedom and Canada via the Under-ground Railroad , the place where Jesse James and his men hid out in the same caves used by the runaway ? slaves . And the river . The Mississippi River . I am deeply affected by that mighty river . The St. Louis Municipal Opera would perform Tom Sawyer , ' and I was there , entranced , and can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind 's eye , Mark Twain as a river pilot , and places like Natchez . I 've never been to Natchez , but I can picture the carny shows there . Above all , I wanted to be a Mississippi River gambler like Tyrone Power , done up with his fancy frock coat and his ruffled sleeves and his big hat  --  and , especially , that fan of his lady 's , the white fan , the one she snapped open with a swift gesture , and then snapped shut . " She continued , " The sense of connection is missing in New York . For one thing , I have only about one-tenth of the writers and painters and poets to nourish me here in New York that I had when I lived around San Francisco and Oakland . I really lived in Oakland  --  a sort of fairyland , where I loved the three-story wooden houses , the picket fences , the man who sold fish from a truck , the man who sold vegetables from a horse-drawn wagon , the man who sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a bucket , and the old ladies coming forth each day to pick their flowers in their front yards . Everything was unconstrained , uncongested , I could think . I could put things together . Most of the poems we 're doing these nights were written during the last three years , and I would read them in bars and bookstores in San Francisco . Just the other night , some-one came backstage and said he missed the intimacy of his first encounter with them , at a San Francisco bar . Tren-ton , where I was horn , seems pretty far behind . But I love my daddy ? after all , he is my daddy . He is a sur-geon , and my mother was a psychiatric social worker and now teaches early-childhood development at Trenton State College , and f have an artist sis-ter and a sister who just graduated from Yale and a brother at Columbia Law . And I 've been to Barnard , and taken Ameri-can Studies at the University of Southern California , in Los Angeles , and here and there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , adolescence  --  hut it was a dou-ble life , and the reading was the real life . I read all the Russians in English ( my goal in life was to free Raskolnikov from his guilts ) and the French in French and the Spaniards with the aid of dic-tionaries . Simone de Beauvoir , Melville , Carson McCullers , and Edna Millay . And Jean Genet . I would say to my mother that I did n't under-stand a word he was saying but I liked him . Faulkner has always been a trial -- I have to pretend to be white to under-stand what he 's saying about blacks . At Barnard , I was alienated , and had only four black friends , but I went back up there last year and told the black students to hold fast , to stick  --  that they would n't find anything more libertarian out-side . I guess I 've been in ev-ery black-nationalist movement in the country , and I found that the flaw in the national-ists ' dream was that they did n't treat women right . Five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Dr. Paul T. Williams , and I was Pau-lette Williams  --  a slave name , really . I am filled with rhythm and blues . My daddy plays some percussion , knows Miles Davis , knows Dizzy Gillespie , knew Charlie Parker . I like to watch dancing , and have studied dancing for three years . And I like to wear sil-ver jewelry , and look at penple . It 's the faces I like to watch . And I like to listen to the words . I 've watched people being beat up , and people putting up fifty thousand dollars bail , and this movement and that movement . Black poets are always having to prove the right to their emancipation , but I approach poetry with a sense of discovery . In San Francisco , I gave out and I got back . I felt this need to keep on giving , because I was getting so much . I have loving friends , and we call each other up and read to one another  --  read poems  --  and talk .

" I walk the city , and watch the faces , and try to remove the mask . My poems are deeply personal . Take the poem that begins ' Somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff . ' I like that poem : ' My stuff is the anonymous ripped-off treasure of this year/ did you know somebody almost got away wif me/ in plastic bag under their arm/ me danglin on a string of personal carelessness . ' wanted to be very clear and very honest in these poems . That 's why I used the words Colored Girls ' in the title . That 's a word my grandmother would understand . It would n't put her off and turn her away . I wanted to get hack to the brass tacks of myself as a child ; I was a regular colored girl , with a family that was good to me . " Ntozake Shange finished her second cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not living in Harlem these days , " she said . " I 'm in Chelsea , with one lock . I know that poetry must be refined over and over , be honed , get stronger . I listen to words , and when people ca n't say what they mean they are in trouble . I remember telling classes I taught at Sonoma State College , in Rohnert Park , California , that when they read a poem with the word ' cry ' they must n't rush through but try to understand that the word had depth , and implication , and that someone was crying  --  that it was n't just a plot outline or a scenario . I 'm relatively happy now , but I am impatient when I 'm not writing . just before the opening downtown , I was working on a story I had to finish .

I am relatively stable at the moment , but I know how shaky the foundation is , how fragile the path I 'm walking . " A grim look came over her face . " You know , one of these days I am going to go up to Saks Fifth Avenue and walk right through that store , door to door , " she said . Then she looked away . " Just this morning , " she said , " I saw a group of women going into a bar downtown at nine-thirty , and I studied those faces and I knew those faces would he there tomorrow morning at nine-thirty and the day after tomorrow at nine-thirty , and I thought about a poem . " Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter plays Putt- Putt . We have a report on this little-known but fast-growing sport from a sportswriter friend named Roger Director : Putt-Putt is the CB radio of the sports world . At last count , there were about thirteen hundred courses , on seven hundred franchised sites , in the continental United States , Canada , Japan , New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , South-West Africa , Rhodesia , and Port Louis , Mauritius . In this country , the courses are principally in Georgia , the Carolinas , Florida , Alabama , Virginia , Ohio , Indiana , and Michigan  --  the Midwest and much of the New South . On any given evening , a quarter of a million people are bent over playing Putt-Putt , a type of miniature golf that disdains the more colorful obstacles ( the windmills , stovepipes , lighthouses , wagon wheels , and loop-the-loops ) and other elements of chance in miniature golf to focus on the skill of putting . " Miniature golf is a game of beautiful , idle amusement , " Don Clayton , the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf Courses of America , Inc. , told me when I caught tip with him recently at the World Putting Championship , which was being held this year in Columbus , Ohio . Clayton , a former high-school and college athlete in his home state of North Carolina , built the first course , in Fayetteville , North Carolina , in 1954- , when he was twenty-nine and his doctor told him he was working too hard in the insurance business . Today , Putt-Putt grosses thirty million annually , and it has a pro tour and organized rankings for amateurs and juniors . " We 've done everything possible to make Putt-Putt competitive , because Americans love competition  --  it 's their nature , " Clayton said . " The game of golf is perhaps the most universal , international sport that is played by the kings of our society today . The bankers , the lawyers , the doctors , the Prime Ministers , the Presidents , the senators , the congressmen , the governors , the chairmen of the board  --  the people who run the world  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or culture , the peasant aspires to do , but for the average mass of humanity in America there 's not enough money and time to play the game of golf . We Prutt-Putt people are the Middle Americans ' country club . We belong to the mass , we belong to the common man , the people . " Clayton offers his franchise owners a hundred and twenty-six specially designed or standardized holes to choose . from for an eighteen-hole course , and each course costs from thirty-five to forty-two thousand dollars to construct  --  depending on whether you get the Suburban or the Standard model . 1Vhichever model it is , Holes One , Two , Nine , and Eighteen are always the same , on any Putt-Putt course . Every Hole Nine , for instance , looks very much like this : Among the optional holes there 's the tricky hole that turned up as Hole Fourteen on the World Championship Course this year : " We are the Mcl ) onald 's of mini-golf " is how one of the pros at the World Championship summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poly-base , tight-weave carpet fibre spread over poured concrete . It is slow enough so that Putt-Putt offers the unusual golfing experience of being able to nudge a deft tee shot toward the cup , then leg it to the green in time to comfortably crouch and watch the ball plop in for an " ace " ? a Putt-Putt hole-in-one . Each of the " fairways " is enclosed by a fence called a bumpboard and made of orange ( the official color ) aluminum two-by-fours , which are held to the concrete by metal anchor pins . The tee is a blue rubber mat twelve inches square , with seven indentations , for a variety of placements . The negotiable obstacles between the putter and his par 36 are aluminum blocks , posts , foot-high fairway mounds , and six-inch inclines  --  which invariably , I found , make the ball break away from the hole , leaving a tricky followup putt for the " deuce . " To play well , you need the concentration and smooth stroke of a championship golfer , plus the touch and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . If you think not being able to get out of a bunker is infuriating , try taking an S to get down from three feet out while four obstreperous peewees line up at the tee and ask if they can play through . It 's a game fraught with frustrations  --  even for the six hundred certified pros of the Professional Putters Association , Putt-Putt 's version of the big-time P.G.A . There are about sixty tournaments on the Putt-Putt pro tour , and over three hundred thousand dollars in prize money is awarded annually to the professionals , who range in age from seventeen to forty-seven . The main events are the National Championship ( to he held this year on September 4th and 5th in Hialeah , Florida ) , which is a 144-hole medal-play event ( lowest number of total strokes takes the trophy ) , offering two thousand dollars to the winner ; and the World Championship , a match-play affair ( lowest number of strokes on any hole cops that hole and " honors , " the right to shoot first off the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and had a field of two hundred and fifty-six this year . Most of the pros at the World Championship were staying at the nearby Lincoln Lodge , which , in addition to a pool table , a swimming pool , a bar , and a pinball machine , offers a real grass putting green out front , where putters could often he seen as late as midnight during the tournament , sharpening up their strokes for the next day 's combat . They are serious sportsmen , who patiently await the spring of each year to dust off their one trusty club , their P.P.A.-insignia shirts with their names sewn on the front , and their white Hush Puppies , and travel to weekend tournaments in places like Montgomery , Alabama ; Waco , Texas ; Springfield , Missouri ; Chattanooga , Tennessee ; Aurora , Colorado ; and Erie , Pennsylvania . These contests offer more camaraderie than monetary recompense , many of the players assured me . But if you stand among them in a foursome while a fellow bends low over a twenty-five-foot tee putt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in a five-knot country drawl , you might for a moment believe you were treading the fairways of the **29;5313;TOOLONG Augusta National rather than the two-hundred-font miniversion that Clayton calls " fifty per cent of the game of golf . " Clayton joined about a hundred and fifty other aficionados in the gallery to watch the final match of the World , between the sensational seventeen-year-old Australian champion , Manuel Serrano , the Bjorn Borg of minigolf , and veteran Dick Florin , an assistant vice-president of the National Bank of Georgia and the 1970 World Champeen . The final  --  like the quarter-finals and semifinals  --  was being videotaped for syndication to some eighty television markets and seventy million estimated viewers at home and around the globe . Florin had attained the final earlier in the day with a stirring sudden-death-playoff victory over twentytwo-year-old Bobby Gilmore , a club pro from Burlington , North Carolina . But Serrano , on the strength of devastating triumphs over Orlando , Florida 's , Mike Pfeiffer and the reigning National champ , Ray Browning , a twenty-seven-year-old C.P.A. from Euclid , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pros on hand . Serrano had sunk aces on twenty-two of twenty-eight successive holes . Also in attendance : Kazuaki Oda , executive director of the Japanese P.P.A. , which was represented at the World by two pros . Speaking through an interpreter , Mr. Oda touted the Aussie 's chances . " Manuel 's putting average is always great , " he said . " No other foreign player has ever come this far . It will take a lot of time for one of the Japanese to win , because our tour is just one year old . But we have learned many things here which we will carry back to Japan . " After being introduced to the TV audience , Florin and Serrano began the match . Florin , weaning a blue shirt that had brought him luck in 1970 , took the lead with an ace on the first hole , while Serrano seemed to be nervous , for the first time in the tourney . The Australian 's concentration faltered , his tee shots went awry , and Florin emerged two-up at the halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With honors on the eleventh , twelfth , thirteenth , and fourteenth holes  --  this last one dubbed The Monster by Pro Putter of the Decade Vance Randall  --  the unflappable Florin tightened the screws with a string of aces . And when Serrano succumbed to a deuce on The Monster he was three holes down with just four holes to play . Florin finished off what the pros call a Black &; Decker job by drilling in an ace on Hole Sixteen , and his wife , Evelyn , and kcal newsmen and scores of galleryites swarmed out of the concrete stands to offer congratulations . The first well-wisher was Serrano , who was consoled with a five-thousand-dnllar check and the prospect of a visit to Disney World , in Orlando . Florin 's win upped his career earnings to $45,638.91 in thirteen years of play fifth-highest on the all-time list . " Being there before had something to do with it , " Florin said later , over a Coke and a Winston . " I knew what it took . I know what it 's like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that garnering this major title put him just fourteen major titles behind Jack Nicklaus , whom he immediately challenged to a putting contest to he held " at reasonable distances  --  up to thirty-five feet . " " Sportsmanship , fairness in play , good , wholesome , and clean competition  --  that 's what we 're trying to present about America , " said David Lloyd , Putt-Putt 's twenty-nine-yearn1c1 president , who serves as commentator on the telecasts , and who says he talks on the phone at least once every two weeks with his good friend Jody Powell , Jimmy Carter 's press secretary Carter made his first appearance on a Putt-Putt course one night in 1966 , during his first try for governor in Georgia . He wanted to show the voters he was a family man , so he came with his family and they all played a round . " Clean competition , " Lloyd told me . " That 's the image of America that I have in my mind and that Don Clayton has in his mind . America had that reputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is good ; it 's the best ; it 's the No. 1 country ; it does everything aboveboard ; it 's fair and it 's square . And that 's basically what we 're trying to portray with this sport . " Roses AVISITING English friend , a garden connoisseur , popped her head round the office door one afternoon a couple of weeks ago . She was wearing a flower-trimmed straw hat of the sort prized by ladies who doze discreetly in deck chairs through languid afternoons of cricket . " Leave all that , " she said , waving airily at a sandwich we were pohshing off and at a desk groaning with trivia , which , as it happened , we held /eft , undisturbed , for years . " We 're off to the Botanic Garden , in Brooklyn , to see the ruse garden in bloom . I rather thought we 'd go by tube . " As we passed through Times Square hound for the IRT , a digital thermometer informed us with a twinkle that it was ninety degrees . Youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that bordered on somnolence . The heat in the subway car was so infernally oppressive that our friend picked up a News abandoned on the seat beside her and fanned herself with a splashy front-page photograph of Elizabeth Taylor 's smile . " Of course , " our companion began brightly , erecting a little hedge of stoicism  --  in a manner peculiarly British  --  against the possibility of disappointment , " one ca n't expect these roses to he at their very best . Today is a bit ton much of a scorcher for that , and this is latish in the season , too . Most of the big , old-fashioned bush roses and species roses will have finished flowering by now , although they will make a different sort of show with their splendid hips , later in the summer . These early flowerers include some of the oldest varieties of rose  --  the sort the Romans liked to strew about for feasts and festivals  --  such as Rosa canine , Rosa gallica , and Rosa alba . We English call that last one Great Maiden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render it as Cuisse de Nymphe brute , or Thigh of an Agitated Nymph . " Our friend 's remarks , launched in a civilized tone when the train was standing still , had ended in a forceful bellow as the train rattled deafeningly down the track and beneath the river to Brooklyn . She leaned closer to our ear , addressing us with articulation so emphatic that it set the silk bouquets on her hat nodding wildly . A young black man sitting opposite us observed this millinery commotion from over the top of his book . He wore steel-rimmed. , Russian-revolutionary spectacles , and he was reading " Ho Chi Minh : A Political Biography . " Our friend , lost in fancy at Lucullan banquets among drifts of ancient rose petals , was oblivious . " Yes , I really believe I like the old single-flowered roses best , " she was saying now . " Those are the roses you see in the carving in Gothic cathedrals and in the designs of heraldry . And those were the roses that poets adored for their exquisite fleetingness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . Roses have been on earth longer than mankind , you know , and they have always been part of human history . There 's a bush in Germany that 's over a thousand years old and still going strong . " She paused , as if to make sure that her audience was trustworthy , and then confided that her " absolutely top-favorite roses " were " the sort with striped petals , which date from the sixteenth century . " She elaborated . " Roses like York and Lancaster and Rosa Mundi , " she said , adding , " Rose of the World " ? and it was an incantation . " Do n't you think that 's the most perfect name ? " There was something very like a breeze aboveground on Eastern Parkway , and , in the Botanic Garden , a soothing play of shadow . We tarried beside the herb garden for a while , inhaling the fragrance of lemon balm , mint , and scented-geranium leaves that were freshly dampened by the rhythmically sweeping arc of a sprinkler . We then pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the semi-darkness beneath the rustling leaves of a cherry tree . A perambulator stood beside her , and her head drooped dreamily over heads of clover in the grass around her . A toddler trotted after a group of pigeons . A blackbird wheeled up from a sun-dappled stream , scattering bright drops of an afternoon bath from the outstretched fan of its wings . " Do reconcile yourself to finding little in the way of old moss roses , or the damasks and Bourbons beloved of the Empress Eugjnie and of the artist Redoute , " said our friend as a last-minute insurance against false hopes for the rose garden , whose trellised hounds we were now approaching . " Yost trust he prepared to see heaps of modern hs hrid teas and floribundas , probably in rather eulgar colors , like Shocking pink and tangerine . " Inside the rose garden , though , our friend 's regrets over what was n't to he found there seemed to vanish before enthusiasm for what was . She darted down brick paths between dazzling beds , calling our attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging its to peer at the saffron-dusted stamens inside a full-blown cup ; and pointing out the scene before us with a proprietary flick of the wrist , as though she were solely responsible for its utter satisfactoriness . The vista was framed for us by an arch constructed like a crossed pair of giant croquet hoops and ribboned with a dense pink fluff of ramblers . In the background was a formal pergola of breezy white trellis , draped with trailing roses . In the middle ground , harmoniously balancing symmetrical beds , was the timeless figure of a gardener , Kent over tile unceasing rose-garden task of cutting off dead heads . " A figure out of Bruegel , do n't you think ? " murmured our friend , with a nod toward the man 's broad hack and sun-ripened straw hat . " Or perhaps a Book of Hours ? " He straightened and waved his pruning shears in amiable greeting as we passed . At the gate , we turned to look back . The rose garden was a mass of pointillist dots of color  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fretwork of white-painted wood . We knew very well that the sea included modern forms and popular colors whose chapter in rose evolution a real rose snob might choose to criticize . But we were nut surprised to find , when we glanced beneath the brim of our English rosarian 's hat , that her face wore a look of rapture.
