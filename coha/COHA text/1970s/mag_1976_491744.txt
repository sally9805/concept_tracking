Before I tell you how I tracked down " Poop " Glover , the child chess prodigy , perhaps I ought to review some of the main facts of his young life , even though you probably know the general story . His real name was Paul , and it was no coincidence , as I later learned , that he had been named after Paul Morphy , the great American chess master a century ago . At the age of three months , Paul became a ward of the Flatbush Home for Orphans in Brooklyn , New York . He did n't learn how to speak until he was five  --  by which time , amazingly enough , he had already beaten a large number of skilled adult chess players , some of whom were of tournament caliber . It was inevitable that he would he compared with Bobby Fischer , another Brooklyn product , but most chess experts who had played against Poop and Bobby at about the same age said that Poop had the edge . The only word he would utter while playing chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkmate . At first , his opponents saw no connection between the word " poop , " uttered in laconic and dis-connected fashion , and the fact of impending checkmate . The reason they were slow in perceiving the significance of the term was that the child would use it to announce checkmate four or five moves before the coup de grace  --  in itself a phenomenon . In Brooklyn chess circles , inevitably , he became known as " Poop . " Among the feats accumulated by the young chessmaster was his performance at the Downtown Brooklyn Chess Club when , at the age of six , still unable to speak except in the crudest sentences , he played eighteen boards simultaneously , winning seventeen and tying one . The tie game was played against Benny Farber , the Brooklyn champion whose great distinction was that he had beaten Bobby Fischer seven out of eleven times in a series of games when Fischer was nine years old . In head-to-head play between Farber and Glover , played over a three-year period  --  between the time Poop was five and eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie six games while losing twenty-three . Poop was brought to the famed Manhattan Chess Club for the first time when he was seven . He proceeded to astound the Manhattan chessmasters by winning all five matches , including a game against the formidable Fairfield Hoban . Hoban , who had twice beaten Sam Reshevsky , had no hesitation in declaring that Glover at seven was the equal of Fischer at fourteen . Cleveland Amory , the social critic and writer , and captain of the Harvard Club chess team , played Poop the week following the child 's astonishing performance at the Manhattan Chess Club . The newspapers quoted Amory , who lost three quick games to Glover , as saying he was certain that , long before the child 's tenth birthday , Poop would be capable of defeating any Grand Chessmaster in the world , Botvinnik , Tal , Spassky and Fischer not excluded . In 1967 , at the age of twelve , Poop Glover suddenly and inexplicably gave up chess . Since Poop spoke only in monosyllables , no one , not even his guardians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally unexpected and obstinate refusal to play . It was thought at first that his lack of interest was only temporary . But , with the passing of weeks and months , he showed not the slightest desire to return to the chessboard . For a long time , in fact , Paul Glover dropped completely out of the news . Having followed him closely , I wondered what had happened . Theoretically , he should be ready to play in major tournaments . I decided to undertake an informal investigation . My first call was at the Flat-bush Home for Orphans . A new director was then in charge . He remembered Paul Glover , to be sure , but said that the boy had been adopted by a family in Indiana . I was allowed to consult the orphanage records and ascertained that a retired child psychologist and his wife had appeared one clay at the orphanage and presented evidence showing that they had some kinship to the woman who was believed to have been Poop 's mother . When the elderly couple met Poop for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrence of orphanage officials , the legal formalities of adoption were quickly fulfilled . The child rather matter-of-factly accepted his new situation , much in the manner of an unemotional stockbroker discounting future changes in the fortunes of a stock . Sensing a good story , I flew out to Indianapolis , rented a car and drove to Elkhart , where I located the home of the retired child psychologist . A boy whom I guessed to be Poop was mowing the ample sloping lawn in front of a rather commodious ranch-style house set well back from the road on an acre-or-more plot . The boy scarcely looked up at me as I passed him on my way up the path to the front door . The professor 's wife answered the chimes set off by my ring . She was an affable , attractive woman . I told her I had come from New Rochelle , New York , and that I hoped I might talk to her and her husband about their adopted son . She seemed not at all jarred by this information ; she smiled and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me into the library , where she asked me to make myself comfortable while she fetched the professor . I scanned the professor 's book collection . There were at least a thousand volumes on psychology and philosophy . The titles on child psychology alone filled five wide shelves . I took down four or five books and saw that the margins and end papers were filled with penciled notes , written in a neat hand . I recalled having read an article by Mortimer Adler , perhaps in the Saturday Review two decades ago , scorning the notion that books should be kept in pristine condition . The best thing that could happen to a book , Adler wrote , was to give evidence of having set ideas in motion . In this sense , the professor 's books were practically jumping . Adler would have been delighted . While I was thus engaged , the professor and his wife entered the study . I was somewhat startled when I saw his resemblance to the late John Dewey , whom I had known at Teachers College of Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . I apologized for the intrusion , then explained I was a free-lance writer and had helped a few nationally known chess players in writing books about the game . While his wife served coffee , the professor asked me about my interest in their adopted child . I knew the only approach to such a man was the unvarnished one . I told him I wanted to find out why the boy had given up the game  --  and why the professor and his wife had adopted him . I thought it might be a good idea to track the story down . " Yes , of course , " said the professor . " It is as much in my interest to talk to you as it is for you to talk to me . " This was a surprise . I had anticipated that I would have to dig hard for my information , yet here was the professor apparently eager to communicate . " There are , as you might expect , " the professor continued , " several conditions to my willingness to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention just the first condition  --  and that is that you do not use my real name in anything you may write . Later , I will tell you the other conditions . " The first condition seemed to me somewhat unrealistic and I said so . After all , if I had been able to find my way to the professor , so would others . Even if I did n't use his real name , people could identify him simply by consulting the records of the orphanage . " It might not be as easy as all that , " he said , looking at me with that same direct , intent gaze I had always associated with Dewey . " The orphanage people telephoned me just after you had gone through their records . The director realized he had probably erred in telling you as much as he did . I told him not to worry about it but requested that he reject any further requests for information . " " Then you expected my visit ? " " We did expect to hear from you , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little research and decided I could trust you . " " Trust me to do what ? " I asked . " After all , part of the story is already in the public domain . " " True , but if I tell you why I do n't want to be identified , I think you will understand the reason for my request . " " Fair enough , " I said . " Let 's go back to 1959 , the year Paul was born . He was named after Paul Morphy , as you may know . Morphy may or may not have been the greatest chess player of his time . What we do know is that he was a romantic figure , was tubercular , wrote poetry and lived in the heart of the Latin Quarter in a house that has since become one of the classic architectural landmarks of New Orleans . My great-grandparents were neighbors of Morphy 's . Morphy was a sort of Proustian character . He lived a secluded life , kept his shades drawn , emerging infrequently for chess tournaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-night cafes in the Quarter . He was bedded down frequently by recurrent attacks of fever and debility  --  another reason for seclusion . " My great-grandmother would bring him food and medication . There is reason to believe Morphy was in love with my great-grandmother , and that they were intimate . She was young and raven-haired and had an exquisite olive complexion . She was regarded as one of the most spectacularly beautiful women of New Orleans . At the time of which I speak she was in her late twenties . On a number of occasions , when Morphy was abed with fever , she would stay with him for many hours at a time . My great-grandfather went off to fight in the Civil War and was killed several months later , shortly before his young wife gave birth to a boy . That boy grew up to be a great doctor and surgeon in New Orleans . He was my grandfather . He was also a genius at chess but played in very few tournaments , in which he performed superbly . But his career wasmedicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess to be played on the tournament level , as you know , calls for a mind that is focused on almost nothing else . " Yes , I know what you are thinking . You are thinking that my grandfather was the son of Paul Morphy . A natural and inevitable speculation . May I say there is no doubt in my mind that this is so . Some letters found in my great-grandmother 's room after her death leave little doubt that her second scn was indeed the son of the man who was perhaps the greatest American chess player who ever lived , Lasker and Fischer not excepted . It is significant that my great-grandmother named her son Paul . It was a rather blatant thing for her to do , but that was the way she was , I guess . " As I said , Paul grew up to be a great doctor . His first son  --  that would be my own father  --  was named Paul , Jr . His middle initial was M  --  for Morphy , of course . I know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , like her great-great-grandmother , was left widowed during a war  --  in this case , the Korean War . This girl , if you can follow the genealogy , was my niece . She left her home in Baton Rouge to come to New York for the purpose  --  I later learned  --  of giving secret birth to a child . It would have been impossible for her husband to have been the father of her unborn child . " After I learned that my niece had mysteriously left Baton Rouge for New York , 1 decided to try to find her  --  tracking her down , so to speak , in much the same manner you found me . Since the death of my brother , I have considered myself my niece 's guardian . My niece 's closest friend , a girl with whom she had gone to college . lived in Brooklyn Heights . It did n't take too much detective skill for me to figure out that was where I ought to start my search . " I arrived in Brooklyn several days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go to the hospital right away , fearing that it might be too much of a shock for the mother , who had carefully planned the birth to take place in secret so as to avoid causing dismay or shame to members of the family . I could understand her feelings . I have one or two relatives who , to paraphrase old Heywood Broun , were prudes to the point where they would put pants on horses if they could . " All I wanted to do was to put my arms around the girl and tell her we 'd be glad to have her move in with us and that we 'd be happy to make any arrangement that would meet her needs . We were even prepared to adopt the baby if she wished us to . But by the time I was able to get to // her  --  this was several days after we arrived  --  she had already carried out her plan . It had been previously arranged with an adoption agency that the baby would be turned over to its new parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw my niece at the hospital , the first thing I did , of course , was to reassure her that we would stand by her whatever the circumstances . She was warm and affectionate in her responses but told us there was no way of altering the plans for the baby . She did , however , agree to return to Elkhart to live with us . " We had no knowledge , of course , of the whereabouts of the baby . My niece had re-solved to say nothing about the matter . She continued to live with us until 1965 , when she died in a flash fire at the community school where she had been teaching . There seemed no end to the tragedies that , generation after generation , had stalked our family . " Sometime in 1967 , I read in the newspapers about the child chess prodigy , Paul Glover . It did n't seem possible that it was our boy , but the age was exactly the same . The orphanage was in Brooklyn . And most of all , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any from my hunches or my excitement that the name should have been Paul . Eerie , was n't it , that his foster parents should have named him Paul ? Pure coincidence , of course . I knew 1 would have to see the boy and bring him back home . " The moment I met the child I knew he belonged to our family . On our side , he had the characteristic shape of head . But his eyes  --  my God , those eyes . . . . If you ever saw any of the portraits of Paul Morphy , you would never forget those deep-set , brooding eyes . When you looked at them it was like looking into a dark eternity . " In talking to the orphanage people , I learned that they had become increasinglyconcerned over Paul 's difficulty in developing his language skills . Even the way he played with alphabet blocks worried them . " I asked the orphanage director whether Paul had overcome his reading problems and learned that the child was severely dyslexic . I was distressed at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation about the fact that he was my grand-nephew . Paul Morphy had suffered from dyslexia and had to be read to until he was almost seventeen . My brother  --  the child 's grandfather  --  was also dyslexic . " Young Paul still does n't read . He has to go to a special school . I 've used all the professional knowledge at my own command to help the boy . We 've still got a long way to go . I ca n't say that he will ever read . But we 've got to continue to try to help him as much as we can . I 'm sure he 's not retarded even though he still speaks in partially formed sentences andhas a very limited vocabulary . " The professor 's wife poured fresh coffee . Up to this point , I could hardly take in what I had been hearing ; the account was such a mixture of the bizarre and the poignant as to seem unimaginable . When the professor reached for his coffee , I thought this was a good time to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so limited be a genius at chess ? " Clinically speaking it is quite possible , " the professor said . " Whatever his inability to read or articulate , he has a most extraordinary memory . They say this is the one attribute that great chess players have in common . " " What about the boy 's interest in chess ? " I asked . " Has he had any opportunity to play ? " The professor leaned forward in his chair . Again , the same intense , direct look . When he spoke , the note of awe in his voice was unmistakable . " Something rather unbelievable happened back there in Brooklyn when Paul , at the age of eight , was playing and heating the best players in the Metropolitan area . In one of those games , Paul made a terrifying discovery about the game . He discovered a fatal flaw in the basic construction of chess . " " A fatal flaw ? " " Yes , a fatal flaw . For hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , the game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game originated . It has been the subject of countless myths and legends . The wise men of ancient India thought the game had been conceived by Vishnu . It is strange , is it not , that few people who play chess have ever questioned its basic design , as though it had been fashioned by the gods . But no one  --  that is , no one until this child  --  had ever discovered a weakness or misconception in the way the game is played  --  a weakness that can take away all its beauty and even its reason for being . And the Continued on page 84 continued from page 31 moment Poop uncovered this flaw , he lost interest . " There is something else . I believe he gave up the game because of his contempt for the people who are addicted to it . Frankly , he thought chess players were rather stupid . He could n't understand why something that was so obvious to him should n't have been perceived by everyone who pretended to know the game . " I could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . Chess  --  infallible and immutable since the earliest historic records , recognized almost universally as the perfect game  --  had lost its mysteries to a child who could n't read , who could barely construct a sentence , but who was now in a position to discredit and perhaps demolish a historic pastime because he had discovered a flaw in the fundamental design . I thought of the profound pleasure the game had brought to numberless men throughout history . Yet here was a boy who could spoil it all . My emotion of awe began to sour ; I could feel my indignation boiling up . " Why is it important that this flaw be made known ? " I asked . " This game has gone on for centuries in the form it has now . Why not let it continue ? Why should n't the secret stay with Paul ? " " That 's just the point , " the professor said . " Let me tell you something . The same day I brought Paul here from the orphanage , I tried to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited him to play . He looked at me with a sadness I do n't think I can ever put out of my mind . No more game , ' he said . I asked him to show me what he meant . ' Game no more good , ' he said . Then he tried to show me why . Playing with white , he began with the standard pawn-to-king-four openings . Then , within four moves and without the loss of a major piece , he was able to prevent my castling . It happened so fast that I did n't immediately catch its significance . Everyone knows , of course , that a player who is willing to sacrifice a bishop  --  it 's called the Danish gambit  --  can sacrifice the piece and prevent his opponent from castling . But this price is generally regarded as too high ; that 's why the Danish gambit is considered unsound . I do n't want to tell you  --  at least , not right now  --  exactly how young Paul did it without giving up a bishop . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What if he has the black pieces ? " I asked . " Same thing . We played a second game . Paul had black . I was determined to use my advantage of moving first to bring about my castling as quickly as possible . No use . Paul was able to exploit his special knowledge of the tragic flaw in chess on both sides of the board . Since castling is an integral part of chess , its elimination from the game also spoils the game . " " You have n't answered my question , " I said . " Why does the secret have to be exposed ' ? Who , other than you , knows about Paul 's discovery ? " " No one , " the professor said . " At least , not so far as I am aware . " " Then why not just keep the secret to yourself ? " " Assume I do . But that does n't meet the problem . I 'm seventy-six years old . Paul is only twelve . I can probably prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? At some point Paul 's bound to tell what he knows . When he does , it will destroy the game . " " But you indicated that he gave up the game as soon as he discovered the great flaw . If he does n't play again , perhaps there will be no occasion for him to disclose his secret . " " Yes  --  Paul has been playing again  --  but not simple chess as you and I know the game . In order to sustain his interest , he has constructed four sets of three-dimensional chess . Try to follow me in this . Each of these constructions is played in cubistic depth rather than on a flat surface . And , since he has four such sets , he contrives somehow to interrelate all the games . Mathematically , it requires a computer to calculate the number of decisions he has to make for each move . Figure it out for yourself if you can . There is the linear board . Then , the board is played as a cube . Then the cube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond me. could understand , however , the main point . The boy had managed to find a level at which his capacity to play chess could be fully engaged . But how did he construct the game so that he could play against himself ? " I have watched him carefully , " the professor said . " He has no interest in playing against living opponents . What he apparently does is to imagine that he 's playing against several grand masters at one time . For example , he has studied the styles of players like Alekhine , Capablanca , Lasker and Morphy  --  yes , especially Morphy . Then he projects himself into the style of each man  --  in order to play against them simultaneously . " " But I thought you said he could n't read . " " Correct , but he does have facility with numbers . And , since the games of the grand masters have all been recorded with numerical notations , he has been able to familiarize himself with their styles . I 've been buying him books with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of books on the lower shelf . I had been told far more than I dreamed of learning about Paul Glover . But why had the professor confided so fully in me ? I put the question to him . // " I told you just a moment ago I was seventy-six . My wife and I are the only ones who know the full story . Maybe it is n't important whether anyone else knows it . Has it occurred to you to wonder what will happen to young Paul after we are gone ? Who will look after him ? Also , it is important for someone to do what he can to keep Paul from destroying chess . " Surely the professor was n't thinking of me . He was scrutinizing me closely and he detected my thinly disguised consternation . " You and your wife have only one son , now twelve , " the professor said . " You are in your thirties . When you were in high school you won a national good citizenship award . You were an orphan yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be willing to look after Paul when we are gone . The only inducement I can offer you is to make available to you the story of his life and leave it to you to determine the circumstances of publication . You will agree with me , I am sure , that Paul may be the possessor of one of the most unusual minds in the world today . In all my years as a child psychologist I have known no case to compare with this one . I have studied the literature and find no instance in which intelligence has run so rampant in one direction while being apparently retarded in all others . It is not unusual , of course , to find men who are masters at chess but are dullards in everything else . Some of them are quite boorish . Boorishness , of course , is not a concomitant of ignorance . But , for some reason , quite a few chess champions have been incomparably lacking in the graces that go with a civilized mind . Young Paul 's propensity for being rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I am trying to say is that this child is going to get into the history books someday . He could do it as a world chess grand master . Of course , he would have to conceal his special knowledge of the tragic flaw in chess . If he did this , he could probably make a career for himself as the greatest grand master in chess who ever lived . Right now , it is possible he could take on Fischer , Botvinnik , Spassky or Tal . Apart from chess , he could , I suppose , offer himself for clinical study . There is n't a research center in the world involved in brain study that would not jump at the chance to put him under observation . As Paul 's legal guardian , you should find it all very diverting and productive . " My mind was spinning . I had come to Elkhart in search of a story and I was being propositioned to accept custody of a human oddity . Then , out of the corner of my eye I saw young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of his terror-stricken young face . I realized that the child had been aware of what was being said . He looked at me , too . In that second or two during which our eyes met , we communicated our mutual helplessness and uncertainty . Then , very quickly , the boy turned and went out the front door , never to return . Several months ago , the professor telephoned to ask my help in checking out two reports about a teenager playing park-bench chess that had just come in  --  one from New Orleans , the other from Minneapolis . We agreed that the professor would go to Minneapolis and Ito New Orleans . I flew down to New Orleans and went directly to the Latin Quarter where I visited the old Morphy home , now officially under the protective care of the landmarks commission . I was taken on a tour of the house . What caught my eye most of all was a portrait of Paul Morphy , dark-eyed and brooding . The resemblance around the eyes to young Paul Glover was almost supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fourteen or so had come to visit the place only a week or so earlier . He moved very slowly from room to room , the guard said , as though recapturing old memories . From the Morphy house , I went to the public square not far away . Several men on park benches were playing chess . I described Paul and asked if they had seen him . One of them said that a boy fitting that description had played blindfolded against him and two other men only three days earlier and had won $1.50 . It was a phenomenal performance , they said . They had asked the boy if he would be coming back the following day . The boy shook his head , not changing expression . He had n't been seen since . I asked if the boy had used a succession of moves at the start of each game to prevent castling by his opponent . They said not . What this meant to me was that Paul had decided  --  at least thus far  --  not to divulge his secret . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of wrecking the game that could enable him to make a living . That trip to New Orleans was almost a year ago . Except for sporadic reports I mentioned a moment ago , nothing has been heard about young Paul . Of one thing I am certain : before too many years there will be a new chess champion in the world or the game itself will cease to exist as we have known it , for he will have revealed the ease with which castling can be blocked without penalty , thus invalidating a feature of the game that is as fundamental as the characteristics of a rook or even a queen . For the sake of countless millions of chess players all over the world , now alive and yet to be born , I hope it is the former . In any case , it is a profoundly unsettling thought to me that a teenager should be at large in the world , the future of chess in his hands  --  or , more precisely , in his compartmentalized brain .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
