Wondering how he could best serve his country in World War II , Norman Rockwell was inspired to paint the Four Freedoms throughout the year 1942 . After their publication in SatEvePost , the U.S. Treasury sent them on a national tour as the centerpiece of a Post art show to sell war bonds . The paintings were seen by 1,222,000 people in sixteen leading cities , and as a result these viewers were inspired to purchase $132,992,539.00 worth of U.S. War Bonds . This incredible performance had another even more fantastic aftermath  --  many Americans were convinced that the Rockwell pictures deserved to rank with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as interpreters of a modern nation . Rockwell himself carried the paintings on his back to Moscow so the other side of the world could see the freedoms we value so highly . One of the paintings bears minute cracks as a result of this journey . ? The Editors PARABLE BY BOOTH TARKINGTON PAINTING BY NORMAN ROCKWELL In a small chalet on the mountain road from Verona to Innsbruck , two furtive tourists sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hills rose in peace that summer evening in 1912 ; indoors , the two remaining patrons , both young , both dusty from the road , sat across the room from each other , each supping at his own small table . One was of robustly active figure , dark , with a bull head ; the other was thin and mouse-haired . It was somewhat surprising to see him take from his knapsack several sketches in water color . Upon this , the dark young traveler , who 'd been scribbling notes in a memorandum book , decided to speak . " You 're a painter , I see . " " Yes , " the insignificant one replied , his small eyes singularly hard and cold . " You , sir , I take to be a writer ? " The dark young man brought his glass of red wine and his plate of cheese and hard sausage to the painter 's table . " You permit ? " he asked as he sat down . " By profession I am a journalist . " " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I might guess that you 've written editorials not relished by the authorities . " " Why do you guess that ? " " Because , " the painter said , " when other guests were here , a shabby man slipped in and whispered to you . A small thing , but I observed it , though I am not a detective . " " Not a detective , " the dark young man repeated . " And yet perhaps dangerously observant . This suggests that possibly you do a little in a conspiratorial way yourself . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because of your appearance . You 're precisely a person nobody would notice , but you have an uneasy yet coldly purposeful eye . And because behind us it 's only a step over the mountain path to Switzerland , where political refugees are safe . " " Yes , no doubt fortunately for you ! " The mouse-haired painter smiled . " As for me , I am in no trouble with the authorities , but I admit that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " The journalist drank half his wine . " Ideas ? With such men as you and me that means ambitions . Socialism , of course . That would be a first step only toward what we really want . Am I right ? " " Here in this lonely place " ? the painter smiled faintly ? " it is safe to admit that one has dazzling thoughts . You and I , strangers andmet by chance , perceive that each in his own country seeks an extreme amount of success . That means power . That is what we really want . We are two queer men . Should we both perhaps be rightly thought insane ? " " Greatness is easily mistaken for insanity , " the swarthy young man said . " Greatness is the ability to reduce the most intricate facts to simple terms . For instance , take fighting . Success is obtained by putting your enemy off his guard , then striking him where he is weakest  --  in the back , if possible . War is as simple as that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter assented absently as he ate some of the fruit that formed his supper . " Our mutual understanding of greatness helps to show that we are not lunatics , but only a simple matter of geography is needed to prove our sanity . " " Geography ? " The journalist did n't follow this thought . " How so ? " " Imagine a map . " The painter ate a grape . " Put yourself in England , for instance , and put me and my dazzling ideas into that polyglot zoo , the United States of America . You in England can bellow attacks on the government till you wear our your larynx , and some people will agree with you and some wo n't , and that is all that would happen . In America I could do the same . Do you not agree ? " " Certainly , " the journalist said . " In those countries the people create their own governments . They make them what they please , and so the people really are the governments . They let anybody stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's said something sensible , they vote to do what he suggests . If they think he is foolish they vote no . Those countries are poor fields for such as you and me , because why conspire in a wine cellar to change laws that permit themselves to be changed openly ? " " Exactly . " The water-color painter smiled his faint strange smile . " Speech is the expression of thought and will . Therefore , freedom of speech means freedom of the people . If you prevent them from expressing their will in speech , you have them enchained , an absolute monarchy . Of course , nowadays he who chains the people is called a dictator . " " My friend ! " the dark young man exclaimed . " We understand each other . But where men can not speak out , they will whisper . You and I will have to talk out of the sides of our mouths until we have established the revolutions we contemplate . For a moment , suppose us successful . We are dictators , let us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech ? If we do n't , men will talk out of the sides of their mouths against us . So they may overthrow us in turn . You see the problem ? " " Yes , my friend . Like everything else , it is simple . In America or England , so long as governments actually exist by means of freedom of speech , you and I could not even get started ; and when we shall have become masters of our own countries , we shall not be able to last a day unless we destroy freedom of speech . The answer is this : we do destroy it . " " But how ? " " By means of a purge . " " Purge ? " The word seemed new to the journalist . " What is that ? " Once more was seen the water-color painter 's peculiarly icy smile . " My friend , if I had a brother who talked against me , either out of the side of his mouth or the front of it , and lived to run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . A purge is a form of carbolic acid that would include the wife and child . " " I see . " The dark youth looked admiring , but shivered slightly . " On the one hand , then , there is freedom of speech and on the other this fatal acid you call a purge . The two can not exist together in the same country . The people of the earth can take their choice , but you and I can succeed only where we persuade them to choose the purge . They would be brainless to make such a choice  --  utterly brainless ! " " On the other hand , " said the painter , " many people can be talked into anything , even if it is terrible for themselves . I shall flatter all the millions of my own people into accepting me and the purge instead of freedom . " He spoke with a confidence so monstrous in one of his commonplace and ungifted appearance that the other stared aghast . At this moment , however , a shrill whistle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , woke the landlord , paid his score and departed hurriedly . The painter spoke to the landlord : " That fellow seems to be some sort of shady character , rather a weak one . Do you know him ? " " Yes and no , " the landlord replied . " He 's in and out , mainly after dark . One meets all sorts of people in the Brenner Pass . You might run across him here again , yourself , someday . I do n't know his whole name , but I have heard him called ' Benito , ' my dear young Herr Hitler . " TEXT BY WILL DURANT PAINTING BY NORMAN ROCKWELL Down in the valley below the hill where I spend my summers is a little white church whose steeple has been my guiding goal in many a pleasant walk . Often , as I passed the door on weekdays when all was silent there , I wished that I might enter , sit quietly in one of the empty pews , and feel more deeply the wonder and the longing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedrals  --  everywhere on the earth . Man differs from the animal in two things : he laughs , and he prays . Perhaps the animal laughs when he plays , and prays when he begs or mourns ; we shall never know any soul but our own , and never that . But the mark of man is that he beats his head against the riddle of life , knows his infinite weakness of body and mind , lifts up his heart to a hidden presence and power , and finds in his faith a beacon of heartening hope , a pillar of strength for his fragile decency . These men of the fields , coming from afar in the uncomfortable finery of a Sabbath morn , greeting one another with bluff cordiality , entering to worship their God in their own fashion  --  I think , sometimes , that they know more than I shall ever find in all my books . They have no words to tell me what they know , but that is because religion , like music , lives in a world beyond words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of consciousness within themselves , and will not say that they are machines . They have seen the growth of the soil and the child , they have stood in awe amid the swelling fields , in the humming and teeming woods , and they have sensed in every cell and atom the same creative power that wells up in their own striving and fulfillment . Their unmoved faces conceal a silent thankfulness for the rich increase of summer , the mortal loveliness of autumn and the gay resurrection of the spring . They have watched patiently the movement of the stars , and found in them a majestic order so harmoniously regular that our ears would hear its music were it not eternal . Their tired eyes have known the ineffable splendor of earth and sky , even in tempest , terror and destruction ; and they have never doubted that in this beauty some sense and meaning dwell . They have seen death , and reached beyond it with their hope . And so they worship . The poetry of their ritual redeems the prose of their daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their better selves ; the songs they sing are shouts of joy in their refreshened strength . The commandments they receive , through which they can live with one another in order and peace , come to them as the imperatives of an inescapable deity , not as the edicts of questionable men : Through these commands they are made part of a divine drama , and their harassed lives take on a scope and dignity that can not be canceled out by death . This little church is the first and final symbol of America . For men came across the sea not merely to find new soil for their plows but to win freedom for their souls , to think and speak and worship as they would . This is the freedom men value most of all ; for this they have borne countless persecutions and fought more bravely than for food or gold . These men coming out of their chapel  --  what is the finest thing about them , next to their undiscourageable life ? It is that they do not demand that others should worship as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In that waving valley are some who have not come to this service . It is not held against them ; mutely these worshipers understand that faith takes many forms , and that men name with diverse words the hope that in their hearts is one . It is astonishing and inspiring that after all the bloodshed of history this land should house in fellowship a hundred religions and a hundred doubts . This is with us an already ancient heritage ; and because we knew such freedom of worship from our birth , we took it for granted and expected it of all mature men . Until yesterday the whole civilized world seemed secure in that liberty . But now suddenly , through some paranoiac mania of racial superiority , or some obscene sadism of political strategy , persecution is renewed , and men are commanded to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and unto Caesar the things that are God 's . The Japanese , who once made all things beautiful , begin to exclude from their realm every faith but the childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who twice littered their peninsula with genius , are compelled to oppress a handful of hunted men . The French , once honored in every land for civilization and courtesy , hand over desolate refugees to the coldest murderers that history has ever known . The Germans , who once made the world their debtors in science , scholarship , philosophy and music , are prodded into one of the bitterest persecutions in all the annals of savagery by men who seem to delight in human misery , who openly pledge themselves to destroy Christianity , who seem resolved to leave their people no religion but war , and no God but the state . It is incredible that such reactionary madness can express the mind and heart of an adult nation . A man 's dealings with his God should he a sacred thing , inviolable by any potentate . No ruler has yet existed who was wise enough to instruct a saint ; and a good man who is not great is a hundred times more precious than a great man who is not good . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silencing of the brave Faulhaber , we are defending the freedom of the German people as well as of the human spirit everywhere . When we yield our sons to war , it is in the trust that their sacrifice will bring to us and our allies no inch of alien soil , no selfish monopoly of the world 's resources or trade , but only the privilege of winning for all peoples the most precious gifts in the orbit of life  --  freedom of body and soul , of movement and enterprise , of thought and utterance , of faith and worship , of hope and charity , of a humane fellowship with all men . If our sons and brothers accomplish this , if by their toil and suffering they can carry to all mankind the boon and stimulus of an ordered liberty , it will be an achievement beside which all the triumphs of Alexander , Caesar and Napoleon will be a little thing . To that purpose they are offering their youth and their blood . To that purpose and to them we others , regretting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of our lives . TEXT BY CARLOS BULOSAN PAINTING BY NORMAN ROCKWELL If you want to know what we are , look upon the farms or upon the hard pavements of the city . You usually see us working or waiting for work , and you think you know us , but our outward guise is more deceptive than our history . Our history has many strands of fear and hope , that snarl and converge at several points in time and space . We clear the forest and the mountains of the land . We cross the river and the wind . We harness wild beast and living steel . We celebrate labor , wisdom , peace of the soul . When our crops are burned or plowed under , we are angry and confused . Sometimes we ask if this is the real America . Sometimes we watch our long shadows and doubt the future . But we have learned to emulate our ideals from these trials . We know there were men who came and stayed to build America . We know they came because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We march on , though sometimes strange moods fill our children . Our march toward security and peace is the march of freedom  --  the freedom that we should like to become a living part of . It is the dignity of the individual to live in a society of free men , where the spirit of understanding and belief exists ; of understanding that all men are equal ; that all men , whatever their color , race , religion or estate , should be given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities . But we are not really free unless we use what we produce . So long as the fruit of our labor is denied us , so long will want manifest itself in a world of slaves . It is only when we have plenty to eat  --  plenty of everything  --  that we begin to understand what freedom means . To us , freedom is not an intangible thing . When we have enough to eat , then we are healthy enough to enjoy what we eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think and discuss things . Then we are not merely living but also becoming a creative part of life . It is only then that we become a growing part of democracy . We do not take democracy for granted . We feel it grow in our working together  --  many millions of us working toward a common purpose . If it took us several decades of sacrifices to arrive at this faith , it is because it took us that long to know what part of America is ours . Our faith has been shaken many times , and now it is put to question . Our faith is a living thing , and it can be crippled or chained . It can be killed by denying us enough food or cloth-ing , by blasting away our personalities and keeping us in constant fear . Unless we are properly prepared , the powers of darkness will have good reason to catch us unaware and trample our lives . The totalitarian nations hate democracy . They hate us , because we ask for a definite guaranty of freedom of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our challenge to tyranny is the depth of our faith in a democracy worth defending . Although they spread lies about us , the way of life we cherish is not dead . The American dream is only hidden away , and it will push its way up and grow again . We have moved down the years steadily toward the practice of democracy . We become animate in the growth of Kansas wheat or in the ring of Mississippi rain . We tremble in the strong winds of the Great Lakes . We cut timbers in Oregon just as the wild flowers blossom in Maine . We are multitudes in Pennsylvania mines , in Alaskan canneries . We are millions from Puget Sound to Florida . In violent factories , crowded tenements , teeming cities . Our numbers increase as the war revolves into years and increases hunger , disease , death and fear . But sometimes we wonder if we are really a part of America . We recognize the main springs of American democracy in our right to form unions and bargain through them collectively , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege of our children to attend schools where they learn the truth about the world in which they live . We also recognize the forces which have been trying to falsify American history  --  the forces which drive many Americans to a corner of compromise with those who would distort the ideals of men that died for freedom . Sometimes we walk across the land looking for something to hold on to . We can not believe that the resources of this country are exhausted . Even when we see our children suffer humiliations , we can not believe that America has no more place for us . We realize that what is wrong is not in our system of government , but in the ideals which were blasted away by a materialistic age . We know that we can truly find and identify ourselves with a living tradition if we walk proudly in familiar streets . It is a great honor to walk on the American earth . If you want to know what we are , look at the men reading books , searching in the dark pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of living peace . We are factory hands , field hands , mill hands , searching , building and molding structures . We are doctors , scientists , chemists , discovering and eliminating disease , hunger and antagonism . We are soldiers , Navy men , citizens , guarding the imperishable dream of our fathers to live in freedom . We are the living dream of dead men . We are the living spirit of free men . Everywhere we are on the march , passing through darkness into a sphere of economic peace . When we have the freedom to think and discuss things without fear , when peace and security are assured , when the futures of our children are ensured  --  then we have resurrected and cultivated the early beginnings of democracy . And America lives and becomes a growing part of our aspirations again . We have been marching for the last one hundred and fifty years.We sacrifice our individual liberties , and sometimes we fail and suffer . Sometimes we divide into separate groups and our methods conflict , though we all aim at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march on without turning back . What we want is peace , not violence . We know that we thrive and prosper only in peace . We are bleeding where clubs are smashing heads , where bayonets are gleaming . We are fighting where the bullet is crashing upon armorless citizens , where the tear gas is choking unprotected children . Under the lynch trees , amidst hysterical mobs . Where the prisoner is beaten to confess a crime he did not commit . Where the honest man is hanged because he told the truth . We are the sufferers who suffer for natural love of man for another man , who commemorate the humanities of every man . We are the creators of abundance . We are the desires of anonymous men . We are the subways of suffering , the well of dignities . We are the living testament of a flowering race . But our march to freedom is not complete unless want is annihilated . The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and an intellectual world . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be living and free , then we must be living and free . If we fail , then America fails . What do we want ? We want complete security and peace . We want to share the promises and fruits of American life . We want to be free from fear and hunger . If you want to know what we are ? We are Marching ! TEXT BY STEPHEN VINCENT BENET PAINTING BY NOR MAN ROCKWELL What do we mean when we say " freedom from fear " ? It is n't just a formula or a set of words . It 's a look in the eyes and a feeling in the heart and a thing to be won against odds . It goes to the roots of life  --  to a man and a woman and their children and the home they can make and keep . Fear has walked at man 's heels through many ages  --  fear of wild beasts and wilder nature , fear of the inexplicable gods of thunder and lightning , fear of his neighbor man . He saw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know why . He saw his children die of plague  --  and did not know why . He saw them starve , he saw them made slaves . It happened  --  he did not know why . Those things had always happened . Then he set himself to find out  --  first one thing , then another . Slowly , through centuries , he fought his battle with fear . And wise men and teachers arose to help him in the battle . His children and he did not have to die of plague . His children and he did not have to make human sacrifices to appease the wrath of inexplicable gods . His children and he did not have to kill the stranger just because he was a stranger . His children and he did not have to be slaves . And the shape of Fear grew less . No one man did this by himself . It took many men and women , over many years . It took saints and martyrs and prophets  --  and the common people . It started with the first fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts of the night . It will not end with the conquest of far planets . Since our nation began , men and women have come here for just that freedom  --  freedom from the fear that lies at the heart of every unjust law , of every tyrannical exercise of power by one man over another man . They came from every stock  --  the men who had seen the face of tyranny , the men who wanted room to breathe and a chance to be men . And the cranks and the starry-eyed came , too , to build Zion and New Harmony and Americanopolis and the states and cities that perished before they lived  --  the valuable cranks who push the world ahead an inch . And a lot of it never happened , but we did make a free nation . " How are you ever going to live out there , stranger ? " " We 'll live on weevily wheat and the free air . " If they had the free air , they 'd put up with the weevily wheat . So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people , we got rid of certain fears . We got rid of them , we got used to being rid of them . It took struggle and fighting and a lot of working things out . But a hundred and thirty million people lived at peace with one another and ran their own government . And because they were free from fear , they were able to live better , by and large and on the whole , than any hundred and thirty million people had lived before . Because fear may drive a burdened man for a mile , but it is only freedom that makes his load light for the long carry . And meanwhile around us the world grew smaller and smaller . If you looked at it on the school maps , yes , it looked like the same big world with a big , safe corner for us . But all the time invention and mechanical skill were making it smaller and smaller . When the Wright brothers made their first flights at Kitty Hawk , the world shrank . With those first fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostle their neighbor nations . Now , again in our time , we know Fear  --  armed Fear , droning through the sky . It 's a different sound from the war whoop and the shot in the lonesome clearing , and yet it is much the same for all of us . It is quiet in the house tonight and the children are asleep . But innocence , good will , distance , peaceable intent , will not keep those children safe from the fear in the sky . No one man can keep his house safe in a shrunken world . No one man can make his own clearing and say " This is mine . Keep out . " And yet , if the world is to go on , if man is to survive and prosper , the house of man must be kept safe . So , what do we mean by " freedom from fear " ? We do not mean freedom from responsibility  --  freedom from struggle and toil , from hardship and danger . We do not intend to breed a race wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any world of man that we can imagine , fear and the conquest of fear must play a part . But we have the chance , if we have the brains and the courage , to destroy the worst fears that harry man today  --  the fear of starving to death , the fear of being a slave , the fear of being stamped into the dust because he is one kind of man and not another , the fear of unprovoked attack and ghastly death for himself and for his children because of the greed and power of willful and evil men and deluded nations . It will not be easy to destroy those fears . No one man can do it alone . No one nation can do it alone . It must be all men . It is not enough to say , " Here , in our country , we are strong . Let the rest of the world sink or swim . We can take care of ourselves . " That may have been true at one time , but it is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a continent in the world . While the air is the air , a bomb can kill your children and mine . Fear and ignorance a thousand miles away may spread pestilence in our own town . A war between nations on the other side of the globe may endanger all we love and cherish . War , famine , disease are no longer local problems or even national problems . They are problems that concern the whole world and every man . That is a hard lesson to learn , and yet , for our own survival , we must learn it . A hundred and sixty odd years ago , we , as a nation , asserted that all men were created equal , that all men were entitled to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Those were large assertions , but we have tried to live up to them . We have not always succeeded , we have often failed . But our will and desire as a nation have been to live up to them . Now , in concert with other free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other children like them all over the world shall grow to manhood and womanhood free from fear . We say that neither their minds nor their bodies shall be cramped or distorted or broken by tyranny and oppression.We say they shall have a chance , and an equal chance , to grow and develop and lead the lives they choose to lead , not lives mapped out for them by a master . And we say that freedom for ourselves involves freedom for others  --  that it is a universal right , neither lightly given by providence nor to be maintained by words alone , but by acts and deeds and living . We who are alive today did not make our free institutions . We got them from the men of the past and we hold them in trust for the future . Should we put ease and selfishness above them , that trust will fail and we shall lose all , not a portion or a degree of liberty , but all that has been built for us and all that we hope to build . Real peace will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won only by long determination , firm resolve and a wish to share and work with other men , no matter what their race or creed or condition . And yet , we do have the choice . We can have freedom from fear . Here is a house , a woman , a man , their children . They are not free from life and the obligations of life . But they can be free from fear . All over the world , they can be free from fear . And we know they are not yet free .
