CUTTER AND BONE <P> by NEWTON THORNBURG <P> 313 pages . Little , Brown . $8.95 . <P> Keep an eye on Newton Thornburg . He has followed his first , rather clumsy effort , To Die in California ( 1972 ) , with a fine second novel that is tense , funny and despairing . Its literary persuasiveness is generated by an extraordinary pair of characters who sound derivative and unprepossessing but run away with the book . Alex Cutter is a disfigured cripple ; in Viet Nam he lost an arm , a leg and an eye . As if to make up for these missing parts , he is a full-time resister and iconoclast who loudly lacerates the world with mockery . His friend and foil is Rich Bone , a handsome and once successful corporate executive who sees life 's flaws so clearly that he has retreated to become a sort of passive picaro . Bone bums around the beaches of Santa Barbara , Calif. , lives off a succession of women and wearily hopes that " something will happen . Something will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses a man stuffing what turns out to be the body of a murdered girl into a trash can . Though the view is only in silhouette , Bone has enough of a sense of the man to gasp " It 's him ! " when later he sees a newspaper photo of Tycoon J.J. Wolfe , a cornpone millionaire from the Ozarks . Such a flash of recognition would , of course , never persuade any court of Wolfe 's guilt . But Bone 's pal Cutter is convinced-perhaps because he associates the Wolfe type with those who sent him to Viet Nam . He devises a reckless plan to blackmail the millionaire . Bone objects that " extortion is a crime . " Shrugs Cutter : " So 's murder . " <P> Desperate Hedonism . Is J.J. Wolfe really the murderer ? Through most of the book , neither Bone nor the reader can be quite sure , though circumstantial evidence certainly points that way . In any case . Bone can not stop Cutter 's quest for " justice . " True to form , he tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and booze than sleuthing . Tension mounts . Can respectable Wolfe be responsible for the fire that guts Cutter 's house and kills his girl and their baby son ? Finally the odd pair journey to Wolfe 's home in Missouri-and doom . <P> The novel 's form-pursuit and confrontation-owes much to the conventional thriller . But Cutter and Bone is much more than skillful entertainment . The places and people ring true , from the desperate hedonism of coastal California , " where America kept trying out the future , " to the Ozarks heartland , where piety and patriotism barely camouflage a native instinct for violence . Cutter and Bone 's own story is charged with a kind of passionate cynicism that makes even grotesques seem likable and , more important , credible right up to the last , startling sentence .
