txt The Transit . Authority raised the bus , and subway fare from 20 cents to 30 cents yesterday to provide additional revenue to meet an increasingly serious deficit . The authority 's board  --  which is composed of the same members as the board of its parent agency , the Metropolitan Trani. - portation Authority  --  approved the fare increase by a 5-to-1 vote . It did so after rejecting a plea from Mayor Lindsay to go along with a plan for raising additional revenue through higher bridge and tunnel tolls and an increased gasoline tax . Dr. William J. Ronan , chairman of both the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Transit Authority , said the Mayor 's plan , requiring action by the Legislature , would not have immediately provided the funds the authority needed for meeting its next payroll on Jan. 15 . Moreover , he said , the Transit Authority currently has a deficit of more than $120-million and is now faced with additional labor costs of $120 , million over the next two years rta a insult of the new labor agreementa with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most Costly Settlement The contract settlement , the most costly in the authority 's history , mandated a fare increase , Dr. Ronan said . The city could have saved the 20. cent fare , he contended , by voting funds to subsidize tram ! sit operations . " The Mayor 's plan provides no money at ell at this lime , " Dr. Ronan said . He noted , too , that there was no indication-that the Legislature would approve the May . or 's proposals and that any action on new taxes was likely to come late , if at all , in the Albany session that opens Wednesday . Earlier in the day Governor Rockefeller pointed out in a letter to the Mayor that Republican legislative leaders had said they would not support any new state-imposed taxes this year . They had also noted that New York City had " existing , unused taxing powers " it could use to provide funds for fare subsidy . Lindsay Is Critical Mayor Lindsay was far front mollified by the view of Dr. Ronan and Mr. Rockefeller . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's action , he lashed out at both officials and asserted that the new fare could have been limited to 25 cents " if there was a will to do it . " The Mayor said it was a " tragic day " for New York City and he described the fare increase as a " shocking example of the indifference " to the needs of the city . ? " This injustice  --  the state decides and the city subway rider pays ? is the worst kind of transgression of the home-rule principle , " he said . Mr. Lindsay declared that Governor Rockefeller had said he supported the city 's proposals , but had declined to fight for them because he could not obtain the approval of the Re . publican leaders in the Assent , bly and Senate . " It is difficult to understand how the pegislature would not have responded to the urgent appeal of the Governor , " the Mayor asserted . " This was a fight worth fighting , and if the Governor , Dr. Ronan and I were united in this battle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain we could have won . " Donald H. Elliott , a member of the Transit Authority and chairman of the City Planning Commission , was the lone dissenter in ? the board 's decision to raise the fare to 30 cents . " I think the board made a mistake , " he said . " The members listened to the Mayor , but I do n't think they adequately took into consideration his proposals . I think it would have been wiser to have raised the fare only to 25 cents . " Dr. Ronan made it clear that he did not want to assign blame for the fare increase . to anyone , but he emphasized that the city had not put up any money with which to run the system . " You ca n't run the system on words and promises , " he said . If the board had postponed its action , Dr. Ronan said , it might have been faced with the necessity of raising the fare to 35 cents later in the year to meet increasing deficits . Promise for 1970-71 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , he promised that the 30-cent ? fare would be maintained through 1970 and 1971 . He estimated that the 10-cent increase would provide $170-million . a year in : additional revenue . He added that he was " no cqstal-ball gazer " and did not ' knout about inflation in the future . But he said that both he and his colleagues believed that a subsidy of mass transportation was necessary in urban areas if fares were to be kept down . There ' was immediate criticism of the fare increase by political figures . The city 's Controller , Abraham D. Beame , said at his first news conference since resuming his former . post that he would seek legis lative approval to return the transit system to city control and to gain financial relief similar to that given the Long Island Rail Road . He charged that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had acted with undue haste to increase the transit fare without full public discussion of all alternatives . Members of the Metropolitan Authority sit also as board members of the Transit Authority . ' They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beame charged that the state administration had been arbitrary and discriminatory in its treatment of the city transit system . Cites L.I.R.R. Aid " The extent of the state 's discriminatory treatment of the city can best be appraised , " Mr. Beanie said , " when you consider that if the city transit system received financial as sistance comparable with the L.I.R.R. , it would net a minimum of $128-million a year ? , enough to pay for the new transit collective - bargaining agreement and to preserve the 20-cent fare . " The City Council 's vice chairman , . Thomas J. Cuite , , called on Mayor Lindsay not to accept any increase in the transit fare as an accomplished fact . He asserted that a low fare was important to the city 's economy and that any increase would hit hardest at those in lower-income groups . The Nassau County Executive , Eugene H. Nickerson , warned before the announcement of the fare rise that the " imminent danger of an increase of 50 per cent or more in sub . way and bus fares in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toll-free expressways . He said it was " senseless and destructive " to take any step that would make rail transportation less attractive and en . courage the use of private vehicles . The Westchester County Executive , Edwin J. Michaelian , declined to comment on the fare rise , adding , " I 'm not a candidate for Governor . " In another development , five private bus companies that carry 300,000 riders a day in Queens and Manhattan , announced last night that they had reached agreement on a new two - year contract with negotiators for the Transport Workers Union . The settlement , which follows closely the one the union worked out with the Transit Authority , is expected to lead the companies to seek a fare increase . The fares on the private lines are also 20 cents now . Bernard Shatzkin , chief negotiator for the companies , said they probably would try to have petitions for an increase appear on the calendar of next Thursday 's meeting of the Board of Estimate . The board 's approval is needed for any increase sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take effect on the lines before Jan. 22 . The five lines are the Steinway Transit Corporation , Jamaica Buses , Inc. , the Triboro Coach Corporation and the Queens Transit Corporation , all based in Queens , and the Avenue B &; East Broadway Transit Company in Manhattan .
