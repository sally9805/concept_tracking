In little more than two decades , Puerto Rico has lifted itself from a sleepy agricultural backwater to a modern state brisk with industry , commerce and tourism . Much of the reason for this transformation lies in the historic economic program " Operation Bootstrap , " which provided large tax incentives to lure development capital to the island . For all the progress , however , living conditions for many Puerto Ricans remain poor . <P> Last week , in his State of the Commonwealth Address , Governor Luis Ferre recommended another historically significant development program aimed at giving workers a greater share of the economy 's wealth . Basically , the notion is to have the government underwrite the cost of stock purchases in private and public corporations for workers who could not otherwise afford it . In addition to giving Puerto Ricans a second income , the plan is expected to stimulate consumer demand and spur business growth . The idea was developed by San Francisco Lawyer and Economist Louis Kelso ( TIME , June 29 , 1970 ) , who helped draft the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan adopted in the U.S. at both the federal and state levels . <P> If approved by the island 's legislature , as expected , the program ( called Commonwealth Co-Investment Plan ) would work this way : a body known as the Proprietary Fund for the Progress of Puerto Rico would be started and managed by six directors , three appointed by the governor and three voted in by shareholders . The fund would raise money by borrowing from banks and other financial institutions , selling securities and getting government grants . This capital would be used to develop new Puerto Rican ventures or expand existing ones . <P> Added Stimulant . Preferred shares of the fund , which would operate like a mutual fund , would then be sold through banks to any employed citizen who earned $500 to $7,800 a year . To buy the shares , investors could get government-backed loans , for which they would not be responsible in case of default . A total of 800,000 workers would be eligible to buy up to $10 million worth of $1 preferred shares issued the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government would match the investor 's purchase of preferred shares by buying him an equal amount of common stock in the fund . Until the loan was repaid from dividends and other income from the securities , the shares would be held by the bank . Thereafter the worker would own the shares outright and get all the income . <P> The new program poses some difficult questions . For example , only those who hold jobs would be eligible for the program . Thus participation would be denied to the neediest citizens , and there are a lot of them ; the island 's jobless rate is about 12% . Still Ferre 's recommendation is a bold call for action in meeting Puerto Rico 's social and economic needs .
