txt House and Senate conferees agreed tonight on a $210-million compromise appropriation for the supersonic transport$80-million less than the Administration requested and the House ? has approved , but enough to keep the program alive . The conference committee 's recommendation goes now to the House , where it is assured of acceptance . In the Senate , however , it faces the threat of a filibuster by adamant opponents who led the successful drive last week to reject the $290-million request and pledged " extended debate " , against any ' effort to continue the project . Senate members of the conference committee were confident tonight that the revised appropriation would win a majority on the Senate floor next week . Magnuson Is Pleased Senator Warren G. Magnuson , Democrat of Washington , a key supporter of the controversial plane , called it " a pretty good victory " for the SST . Though the Senate vote against the $290-million was 52 to 41 , Mr. Magnuson said that a half-dozen or more Senators had assured him , since then that they had not intended to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maine , voted for the $210-million in conference after opposing the $290-million figure last week . Senator John C. Stennis , Democrat , of Mississippi , who has always supported the SST , said that many Senators shared Mrs. Smith 's apparent change of . heart . President Affirms Stand - President Nixon , at his news conference , defended the SST and said he believed " we can answer the arguments of the conservationists " who have opposed the development of the plane . Question 7 , Page 32 . . " What is involved here is not just 150,000 jobs which will be lost if we do n't build it , not just the fact that billions of dollars in foreign exchange will be lost if we do not build it , " he said , " but what is ' lost here is the fact that the United States of America , which has been first in the world in commercial aviation from , the time or the Wright Brothers , decides not just to be second , but not , even to show . " Senator John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected publicly to the restoration of funds but was under stood to have assured Senator ' Magnuson that he would not , speak against the appropriation ' when it comes back to the Sen. ate floor . Senator Clifford Case , Republican of New Jersey , also relimed to endorse the restored funding but said he had not decided whether to join the proposed filibuster against it . " Senator Stennis was at pains to emphasize the view that the conference committee had not defied or ignored the Senate 's ; vote against the plane . - ' " The conferees gave the utmost consideration to the will and sentiment of the Senate , " ' he said . He had learned in pri-vete conversations , he said , : that " there was great concern about killing the program entirely ; I do n't believe a majority of the Senate wanted to just stop the program . " A conference report , he suggested , involves " a reconsidera-tic:on of a subject in the light of what has happened . " Conferees said they had a difficult time persuading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , , they said was the point where any further cutting would create delays in the completion of two prototypes and add to the over-all cost of the program . The Department of Transportation had projected , on the basis of a $290-million appropriation this year , that the prototypes would finish their test flights early in 1973 after a total government investment of about $1.3-billion . Roughly $800-million has already been spent , including a little over $100-million in the current fiscal year that has not yet been formally appropriated . There was no indication tonight just how much delay or how much additional cost the $210 - million appropriation would create later on . The new figure was known , however , to have been supported by both the Boeing Company and the Department of Transportation as enough to forestall breaking up the team of scientists , engineers and subcontractors that has been working on development of the 1800-mile-an-hour airliner . The $210-million , It was reported , would mean some postponement of hardware procurement but would keep design and research work going essentially as before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by men who had supported the program . During one conference recess , Senator Magnuson , who represents the state where the Boeing Company Is doing the bulk of the SST work , said he was still pushing for restoration of the entire $290-million . Of the seven Senate conferees , four ? Mr. Stennis ; ' Mr. Magnuson ; Alan Bible , Democrat of Nevada , and Gordon Allott , Republican of Colorado ? voted last week against cancellation of the funds . Mrs. Smith , Mr. Pastore and Mr. Case voted to strike the $290-million appropriation .

Mahon ; Democrat of Texas ; Edward P. and , Democrat of Massachusetts ; Tom Steed , Democrat of Oklahoma ; John J. , Democrat of California ; Frank ' T. Bow , Republican of Ohio , and , Jack Edwards , Republican of Alabama . s The other three House members of the conference committee are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. Conte , Republican of Massachusetts , who voted against the SST Tuesday , and William E. Minshail , Republican of Ohio , who has voted on both sides of SST battles in the past and recorded himself this week as " present . "
