These are bad times for reason , all around . Suddenly , all of the major ills are being coped with by acupuncture . If not acupuncture , it is apricot pits . <P> <P> So said Lewis Thomas , the distinguished physician and writer ( The Lives of a Cell ) , soon after he became president of Manhattan 's famed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center four years ago . Last week his sardonic words rang truer still . After five years of exhaustive studies with mice , researchers at his world-renowned institute concluded that in spite of early indications it might control the spread of tumors , the controversial drug Laetrile showed no anticancer properties . Yet even while they were strengthening the scientific case against the apricot-pit extract , also known as vitamin B17 , Laetrile 's supporters were predicting that the drug - now used illicitly by tens of thousands of cancer patients - would soon be sold legally everywhere . <P> They had reason for optimism . Although the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) refuses to sanction Laetrile as a cancer drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its value , Indiana , Florida and Texas lawmakers have just joined Alaska in voting to allow use of the drug . Similar bills are pending in some ten other states . <P> Laetrile has also been winning victories in the courts . A Kansas man who had rectal cancer testified that the compound , which releases cyanide in the body , is keeping him alive . A federal judge not only let him import the drug - available in Mexico , West Germany and other countries - but forced the reluctant FDA to hold its first public hearings on Laetrile . The two-day session in Kansas City , Mo. , attracted 300 supporters , who continually booed and jeered the drug 's critics . <P> These legal and legislative triumphs are only partly attributable to intensive propaganda by such Laetrile advocates as the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy and other right-wing organizations that employ films , pamphlets and evangelizing visits to cancer victims to promote Laetrile . More important is the fact that although doctors can often cure the disease - if it is caught early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All too often , treatments are extremely expensive ( the median cost of a cancer case was calculated in a 1973 study at $19,000 ) , physically painful and , when surgery is required , sometimes permanently damaging . By contrast , Laetrile is portrayed as a simple , inexpensive panacea ( about $10 a shot ) . <P> Vigorous Counterattack . FDA officials are vigorously counterattacking by appearing before legislative committees , enlisting the support of the nation 's doctors , and encouraging the Justice Department to crack down on Laetrile pushers . Among those already convicted : Medical School Dropout Ernst T. Krebs Jr . of San Francisco , who with his late father first advocated Laetrile as an anticancer drug in the U.S. Four of Krebs ' associates , some of whom amassed millions of dollars , were found guilty last month of conspiring to smuggle and distribute contraband Laetrile in the U.S. They are scheduled to be sentenced in San Diego federal court this week .
