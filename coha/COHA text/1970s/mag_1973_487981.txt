The court actions in which the President and Vice President are currently involved have touched off a rash of speculation and conjecture ; seldom have legal and constitutional experts been so much in the news or enjoyed such an opportunity to exhibit their learnine . While they debate among themselves , there is little point in editorial speculation about what the courts may ultimately decide , But the politics of the situation  --  which finds the White House , in Time 's phrase , " awash in scandal " ? does invite Comment . For a split second there seemed to be a chance that the President could stave off constricting pressureslong enough to map a strategy of extrication . The Kissinger appointment , the Congressional , recess , the Ervin commit ; tee 's failure of nerve and the fast-breaking Agnew story ' gave him brief hope of a little breathing space . But his room for maneuver has suddenly , narrowed and he is now in deeper trouble than before the Congress took its sum- , mer holiday . There was never any reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best de- ' fense . Nor could the President demand his resignation . Apart from the fact that it would be unfair ( not perhaps a serious impediment in the White House today ) , such a demand would alienate conservatives who still constitute ' the dominant faction in the Republican Party . And since the President is under a cloud himself , he could hardly take a high and mighty stand in relation to Agnew , the more so since it might seem inconsistent with his own ' posture . " Despite differences in their situations , both President and Vice President contend that impeachment is a piior condition to their obligation to answer charges in the courts . The President , of course , would like to believe that he is the only living American who enjoys this privilege , but if it extends to him it may also extend to the Vice President . At a different level , it can be argued that initially Agnew 's predicament was seen as being of some tactical advantage to the President . At least , the White House must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became public , yet did nothing to stop the investigation . The advantage would lie in the fact that the legal issue involving the tapes will doubtless be decided before the Agnew issue is resolved . Should the Supreme Court order the President to surrender the tapes and should he refuse then , as Senators Kennedy and Mondale and others have said , Congress would have to consider impeachment . But would Congress , which in any case dreads the thought of impeachment , decide to proceed against the President if his constitutional successor was under indictment and thus might in turn be subject to impeachment ? Speaker Carl Albert has many friends and admirers , but the prospect of this little man seated behind that big desk in the Oval Office is enough to dampen the enthusiasm even of impeachment buffs . At the outset , therefore , Agnew 's difficulties may have been regarded by the White House as not merely a welcome diversion but a new spoke in impeachment 'S wheel . They also promised ? scope for evasive action . Should the Vice President , be indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use the naming of a successor as yet another red herring across his tracks . , These prospects are now blighted . Agnew , angered by the way he has been treated , has decided to fight back . He has leveled savage charges against Henry Petersen and , by implication , has accused the Attorney General of tolerating " leaks " that have prejudiced his ' case . The fact that Beall , Petersen and Richardson are all Nixon appointees , however , made it impossible for Agnew to plead partisan bias . So he decided to seek the intervention of Congress . Thus , as the President looks to the courts for protection , the Vice President , reversing . his previous stand , now wants Congress to exonerate him of charges that it would seem could be more , fairly tested in a court trial . The rapid escalation of the Agnew scandal is now more of an embarrassment than a boon to the President . He is in no better position to ask the Attorney General to quash the grand jury proceeding than he is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Department of Justice is likely to become still more embittered . It has been suggested that Nixon could always send Archibald Cox back to Harvard , and that might help with the tapes ; but it would not be so easy to dismiss Richardson . And any attempt to fire Cox would be regarded by Democrats in the Senate as a repudiation of the understanding which won confirmation for Richard-'son . Neither the public , nor the opposition nor the , press is demanding Agnew 's resignation at the moment . If he is indicted , some will say that he should resign . But he has now said , and repeated , that he will ; not resign if indicted . If he holds to that line the President can not play politics with the issue of apossible successor . Besides , it is doubtful , that Congress would confirm John Connally or any nominee who might be a strong candidate in 1976 . At the same time , if Agnew is indicted , and the proceedings drag on , and he does not resign , the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections of 1974 and 1976 . Finally , it is probably a mistake to assume , as the pundits are doing , ' that the current scandal has terminated the political career of Spiro Agnew , whatever the outcome . If Agnew is ' not indicted or if he should be indicted , tried and then acquitted , he would be very much alive politically . ' In the meantime , of course , the clouds hanging over both President and Vice President have at least partially paralyzed the office of the Presidency . Only disclosure of the tapes is likely to lift the shadow from the President : for , whatever the courts may decide , the ' public feels strongly that he should yield the tapes . Only non-indictment or a verdict of not guilty on all counts would remove the shadow from Agnew . So we face a sharply divided Administration in which the Vice President is at war with the Attorney General , and the President can neither reconcile their positions nor fire one or the other or both . He is locked into a situation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hell . It is not a happy situation for him or the rest of us and no resolution is immediately apparent . ' It is the iresident , hOwever , who should remain the focus of attentiOn . A Vice President under indictment , or even on trial for sundry criminal offenses , would not in itself present a constitutional crisis . But if impeachment proceedings against the President took place at a time when the Vice President was under indictment or appealing a conviction , that would precipitate such a crisis . At that point perhaps the President would resign , at the request of a committee from the Establishment . The logical way out of the whole mess would be for Congress to declare both offices vacant and order an interim Presidential election for 1974 . But we have a Cohgress , not a Parliament . Nixon-Pentagon Win Again All through the cold-war years , the Congress as a matter of course approved the military 's annual budget . Few if any questions were raised , and often the Pentagon ended up , with more money than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid grounds for expecting sharp debate ; serious consideration and a less prodigal waste of national resources badly needed for constructive purposes . American troops and airmen were no longer fighting in Indochina , and Nixon-Kissinger had triumphantly concluded a d  --  tente of sorts with the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China . In fact , the Congress did shOw some signs of behaving like a deliberative body . Last summer the normally hawkish House trimmed $950 million from the procurement budget ; it was an early action , to be sure , but Pentagon critics took , it as a good augury . The Senate Armed Services Committee did even better ; it voted cuts of more than $1.5 billion . Then both chambers caved in and gave NixonLPentagon all they asked for , and more . Every major ' weapons system was rammed through by a lobbying effort of , outrageous proportions ; though the margins were narrow , Nixon and company emerged on the long end . , The action in the Senate unfolded in two stages . Senator Mansfield pushed through a 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . Then the whips started cracking , votes were switched , and the Mansfield amendment went down by 51 to 44 . A compromise was reached : overseas troop strength would be reduced by 110,000 men ( 23 per cent ) by the end of 1975 . That went through nicely , but January 1 , 1976 is a long way off , and right now the bill goes to conferehce . Since the House is opposed , the chances are that this symbolic victory will vanish in thin air . The second stage involved the Trident submarine program . Both the House and the Senate are substantially agreed that eventually the Trident will supplant the existing Polaris-Poseidon subs . With forty-one of these latter on station or undergoing missile updating ( multiple targeting , etc. ) the United States is not exactly naked before its enemies , and originally the Navy was satisfied with 1980 as the target date for completion of ten Tridents at about $1.3 billion apiece ( or will it be $1.5 billion , or more ? Early estimates are meaningless ) . Mr. Nixon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 1973 gram , and the Navy was easily persuaded to cut two years off the completion date . Opponents tried to keep the original schedule and to appropriate only $885.4 million for 1974 . But the Navy , having been given the signal by Nixon , insisted on $1.5 billion and got it . Senator Symington said the Navy-Administration lobbying was the most intense he had witnessed in more than twenty-eight years in government , and as a former Secretary of the Air Force- he should know . To add volume to the clamor , the Navy called back into active service ( although not in uniform ) Vice Adm . Hyman Ribkover , the nuclear sub expert who is so greatly revered on the Hill that Congress kept him on active duty when Navy brass wanted to get rid of him . Effective as Rick-over was in his lobbying assignment , he was outdone by Adm . Elmo Zumwalt , chief of naval operations , who was quoted as telling a TV interviewer that " Soviet agents " were lobbying on Capitol Hill against the Trident . Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant was : " The Soviets in a host of ways , including the use of employees here , do make a concerted effort to impact upon U.S. policy . " As intended , this sounds sinister , but he did not name the employees . The vote on Trident was close-49 to 47 ? but that will make no difference to General , Dynamics , which is designing the hulls , and Lockheed Aircraft , which is being rescued from bankruptcy by its labors on the missiles . Their experts in jacking up prices will be working alongside the engineers . If the Navy put on a great lobbying show , the Army was not far behind . Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster , Jr. , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , just happened to be in Washington and did yeoman work on the telephone to block troop cuts in his theatre . And Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger wore out his shoes in the Capitol corridors on behalf of all the services . Meanwhile , the Defense Department prevented reporters from interviewing Navy experts on the Trident program while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must go to the President . His d  --  tente with the Soviets consists of speeding up the armaments race , and with the accelerated Trident he has a priceless " bargaining chip " in his hand . The White House announced that it was " very pleased " by the outcome . Sen. George McGovern , was not pleased . He tried the frontal approach of a $78-billion ceiling ' on defense appropriations ? $7 billion less than requested by the Administration . " While the President hails a ' generation of peace , ' " Mr. McGovern complained , " he offers a budget that prepares for a generation of war , of more and more elaborate new weapons , and of American forces still scattered all over the globe . " The vote was 81 to 12 against the McGovern amendment . Watergate has hurt Mr. Nixon badly , but when - it comes to weaponry he can still push the Congress around . Death Row Returns For two decades , up to June 29 , 1972 , the movement to abolish capital punishment seemed to be making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a 5-to-4 vote  --  there were ' nine separate opinions  --  the , Supreme Courtstruck down most capital punishment laws and , in effect , commuted the sentences of some 600 prisoners then on death row . But the majority did not hold capital phnishment to be unconstitutional ; it merely said that , since the evidence showed that the death penalty was imposed in a haphazard and discriminatory manner  --  usually against the black and the poor  --  it could not be upheld as so applied . The effect of the decision , as Chief Justice Burger 's opinion made clear , was to encourage state legislatures to amend their laws so as to obviate the Court 's objections , and local law-and-order politicians were quick to get the message . Most of the new laws narrowly define the crimes for which the death penalty may be imposed  --  as in , the case of the murder of a police officer or a prison guard  --  and escape the charge of haphazard or unequal enforcement by making the death penalty mandatory in such cases . The result has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those they replaced . Perhaps as many as fifty states , it is currently estimated , will restore the death penalty by adopting such statutes . The California situation is of particular interest . There , a California Supreme Court decision which held the death penalty to be-basically unconstitutional ' so outraged Gov . Ronald Reagan and other politicians in his camp that an initiative measure ? Proposition 17 ? which purported to give the legislature the right to restore the death penalty was placed on the November 1972 ballot . Though of dubious constitutionality , the initiative carried by a 2-to-1 vote and the state legislature ( by votes of 29 to 11 in the Senate and 52 to 25 in the House ) recently enacted a measure which restores and makes mandatory the death penalty in eleven specific types of first-degree murder . Governor , Reagan , , expressing his personal belief that a reinstatement of the gas chamber will save " many lives of law-abiding citizens and their families , " has just signed the measure . It will go into effect January 1 , but , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row : The movement to restore the death penalty , which seems to be gathering momentum , probably represents no more than a temporary retreat in a climate of fear and reaction . But retrogression might be a better term . True , there have been no executions since 1967 , and some of the new statutes may well be invalidated for one reason or another . But once again the death rows are gradually filling up ; since the Supreme Court 's decision in 1972 , more than a dozen defendants have been sentenced to death . One more Nixon appointment might well result in a Supreme Court decision which would accelerate the present trend . Sentiment for the death penalty fluctuates in relation to the political climate ; it is , in fact , a fairly accurate barometer of political health and social well-being . When society is caught up in a cycle of anxiety , as at present , agitation for capital punishment increases ; when social confidence returns , it usually recedes . In a time of fear , the murder of a single police officer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such a period , belief in the death penalty as a deterrent increases without regard to ' the strength of the case against it . For example , there has been a striking increase in murders in cities and rural areas in the first half of this year , despite restoration of the death penalty in some nineteen states . - The most depressing aspect of the current retrogression is the fact that those who advocate capital punishment also oppose all attempts to tighten gun controls ; the two constituencies are virtually identical . Guns are , of course , murder weapons in more than 50 per cent of all homicides and where they are properly controlled , as in Japan and other countries , the homicide rate declines . But with us the right to own a gat  --  if only a Saturday Night Special  --  is regarded as a ' sacred frontier legacy and protected by folk beliefs of almost Biblical sanctity . At the moment , 57 per cent of those polled favor restoration of the death penalty  --  the highest proportion in two decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , put their faith in violence ; the gun and the death penalty will protect them even if the police can not . Despite the upsetting circumstance that some of the best known apostles of " law and order " and " get-tough " measures of all kinds now face the prospect of serving time themselves , the mindless agitation , for mandatory sentences , including the death penalty , which began in 1968 , continues . The struggle to abolish capital punishment , which has survived similar reversals in the past , will survive this one but until the political skies clear , death rows will have more tenants . Old South No More ' If the metaphor were not so odd , one might say that the ice is breaking up on the Swanee River . Great fissures are cracking across the glacial South , and strange , valiant heads can be seen bobbing up among the floes . One is that of C.P. Ellis , president of the Durham , N.C. chapter of the Klan and president of his union local , about whom Edward McConville writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom : Turnipseed of Columbia , S.C. , formerly national campaign director for George Wallace and now executive director of the South Carolina Taxpayers Association . Mr. Turnipseed would be , news , if for no other reason , because he stepped recently onto the platform of the South Car  --  lina NAACP Convention to make the following statement : " The entire history of black ' people in America is one of exploitation by those who have always tried to grow rich and powerful at their expense . " To some elements of the South , Mr. Turnipseed is exceedingly bad news . The Taxpayers Association , of which he is the most visible spokesman , is a budding interracial Populist organization ( 4,000 members ) and it has been going after the state 's money elite like a swarm of bees . South Carolina Electric &; Gas has been trying to get the Public Service Commission to grant it a 13 to 22 per cent rate increase . This grab was brought to public attention two years ago by two black lawyers in Columbia , Deivey Duckett and Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top priority issue . Turnipseed has not been suddenly washed in the blood of the Lamb : his critics point out his connections with segregated private schools and his opposition to bussing . But on bread and butter issues , citizens of the state , black and white , have learned that Governor ' Wallace 's former campaign strategist is pulling no punches and drawing no color lines . " These powerful men , " he told the NAACP audience , " do n't care a bit about you or your needs , or mine either , for their exploitation of us transcends color . . . . " Harry Dent , like Turnipseed a white lawyer , has returned to Columbia after serving as an aide to President Nixon and being the acknowledged architect of Nixon 's Southern strategy . Dent is not saying much these days , but is believed to have his eye on the South Carolina Governor 's office , which becomes vacant next year . If so , he may have to reckon with Tumipseed 's Populism . With his still effective Wallace connections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson Davis Turnipseed  --  the man is bound to attract a crowd . One might say as a sour postscript that ' Tumipseed is probably an ambitious man who knows which way the wind blows . But the secret of keeping the democratic system going is to let politically ambitious men feel appropriate drafts . Whatever the motives of a Turnipseed , the earth moves down South . Pablo Neruda Pablo Neruda is dead , reportedly of cancer . His death came within . a very few days of that of his friend , Sal-. vador Allende Gossens , reportedly a suicide , but in all likelihood murdered by the forces of the military junta that has seized power in Chile . Neruda was a fervent partisan of the Allende government , though , visionary that he was , he must have regarded it as cautious to the point of half-heartedness in advancing the revolutionary goals which his verses had celebrated unceasingly and , done much to make acceptable to so many of his countrymen . A widely circulated poem ascribed to him , and supposed to have been written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to the junta had he survived ; his attitude to the detention in improvised con-centration camps of thousands of . Chileans and foreigners , and the'shooting of hundreds of the prisoners , would no doubt have found pungent expression in verse , for he was never politic in his opposition to tyranny . In any case his library , which contained many of his manuscripts , was sacked during the military rebellion . Spokesmen for the ruling junta have deplored the destruction of a collection of books and papers that amounted to a national treasure , and of course denied any complicity in that act of barbarism . The great Emathian conqueror bid spare The house of Pindarus , when temple and tower Went to the ground : and the repeated air Of ' sad Electra 's poet had the power To save th ' Athenian walls from ruin bare . The revolting military chiefs in Chile were not so well advised , and history is likely to judge them infamous . Neruda 's poetry is in general ill-served by its English translations  --  through no fault of the scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets in their own right . The fault lies with the demotic speech that industrial society has fostered , and with the variant employed by literary men writing in English in our day . Poetry ' is above all the art of evoking powerful emotions through verbal music , and Neruda 's exuberant Spanish has its counterpart in the English poetry of the Renaissance rather than in the sober dialect of our contemporary major poets  --  or the willful stridencies of some of our lesser writers . Neruda in translation tends to sound inflated and bombastic . Nothing could be less true of the original . His unbridled imagination was served by perhaps the most extraordinary linghistic faculty Tot'any modern poet , so that it would not ' be wholly inappropriate to apply to him Dante 's apostrophe : And are you that Vergil , that wellspring pouring abroad so ample a stream of speech ? Pablo Neruda 's living voice will no doubt continue to hearten and admonish his countrymen . But it seems most likely that when this last sad occasion for his embattled art has been very nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glories of the Spanish tongue .
