txt PRINCETON , KJ . ? " There are bal ? let productions . . out in the low-gravity recreational complex that serves all the residents of our region in space . Ballet in one-tenth gravity is beautiful . " The letter from Edward and Jenny was full of wonderful things about their new home in Bernal Alpha , one of the first space habitats to be built at L-5 , a point near the moon where the earth 's and moon 's gravitational field tend to offset each other . Of course , the letter is fictional . It is dated in the 1990s . Yet it may come true . The scientist who composed the letter wrote it as a prediction of humanity 's migration to space habitats . lie is Prof. Gerard K. O'Neill , a member of Princeton University 's Physics Department , one of the most prestigious on this planet . O'NEILL HAS been planning space colonization since the fall of 1969 , when he raised the subject at a freshman physics seminar and found it impossible to resist himself . His book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was published this year and told how to do it . Seemingly overnight , there 's a new space cult of people who want to live in orbiting habitats , and O'Neill is their prophet . In his fictional letter from the future , O'Neill describes the Bernal Alpha // space habitat , a sphere about 500 meters in diameter , with an inside circumference at its " equator " of nearly a mile : " It rotates once every 32 seconds , so ? uncle is earth gravity at the equator , " Edward and Jenny write . " The inside of ? the shell is covered with land , low-rise terraced apartments , shopping walkways , and small parks . Our trees have had a chance to grow to good size . " THEY TELL ** sunshine always comes in at the same angle , but can be cut off at night and adjusted to duplicate a climate . similar to Hawaii 's . Though roomy enough for , 10,000 residents , it 's really only a small habitat , they write . Much bigger ones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Half the people we meet are ready to go , " said Keith Henson , an electrical engineer from Tucson . He is president ? of the L-5 Society , a group actively planning future life in space . " I think people are looking forward to something equivalent to homesteading . days , " said Ilenson 's wife , Carolyn , who edits the society 's monthly newsletter . THE IIENSONS were among founders of the L-5 Society too years ago . Its membership has been quadrupling every six months and has reached 1,200 , ranging from space scientists to high school students . The Hensons and 100 other members are out preaching the space word with slide lectures . O'Neill is receiving letters from all over the world ? about 5,000 a year . Recent letter writers included a 70-year ' old Swiss engineer , a Bombay ' 15-yearold , and an African college student , Space colonization may sound far-out , but It can be done , O'Neill said in an interview . " We 're in a kind of engineering we can understand , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure that by the early years of the next century people are going to be building large space habitats . You could build these things 10 miles across . " TO O'NEILL It 's serious business , not merely fun at , the low-gravity clubhouse . Besides shaking plans for colonization , he also is working on a way of harnessing energy from space The O'Neill Plan would create , at a cost of $25 billion , a huge orbiting solarpower complex beaming electricity in the form of microwaves to collecting stations on earth . It would take five years of development and seven years of construction . At the end of that time he envisions five energy ' stations , each 10 miles long and each having a capacity of 10,000 megawatts , enough electricity for a city of 31/2 million people . To send into space such a vast amount of construction material could bankrupt the planet and damage the biosphere with rocket blasts . But O'Neill would n't do it that way . IIE WOULD USE the space-shuttIo fleet , now in construction , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then assemble an electromagnetic engine to tow it into high orbit , where vast quantities of lunar dirt would be refined and fabricated into metal and silicon parts for the space civilization . O'Neill said he has been discussing his plan with government experts and also , recently , with an investment type considering the private-enterprise opportunities . Ho thinks the economic purpose of cheap power from space would have to be achieved first to provide the motivation for building luxury habitats . He said the tallor-made living in orbit is likely to coma about as a result of agitation for better quarters by the workers building the power stations . Not the least of the arguments for the O'Neill plan is the incalculable potential for scientific discovery from such an enormous project . MANY OF O'NEILL 'S supporters In the L-5 Society believe that man should be doing something in space , especially now that the shuttle fleet Is expected to be operating ill early 1080s . This would permit O'Neill 's five years of development to begin now . There 's an even loftier hope in some minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water systems are in place , it , is inevitable that some day one of them is going to head for another star . The habitat would be a good starship for a journey of many years . The travelers would not need to have a planet to land on , but could stay in the habitat , The nightmare of space freaks is that their ship will ! navel . for most of a lifetime and then they would find that the target star system does n't have a livable planet .
