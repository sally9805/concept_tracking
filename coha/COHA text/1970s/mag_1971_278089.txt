While there are still plenty of people who associate extrasensory perception with science fiction movies and low laughs from nightclub comics , there is also a growing number of scientists who believe that ESP is as worthwhile as reaching for the stars . Among these Astronaut Edgar Mitchell , U.S.N. , reported last week on his ESP experiments conducted during the flight of Apollo 14 last February . <P> Mitchell made preflight arrangements with four people to beam them , telepathically , various symbols in random sequence . He attempted transmission during four rest periods on the flight , then had the results checked after his return . <P> By normative statistical measurements the findings were significant . Mitchell scored 51 hits on his recipients ' consciousness out of 200 , where chance allows for only 40 . According to the laws of probability , the odds against such a score are 20 to 1 . Still , it is rather discomforting to think of a space-age Lamont Cranston peering into the minds of earthlings as he sails among the stars .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @     @x While there are still plenty of people who associate extrasensory perception with science fiction movies and low laughs from nightclub comics , there is also a growing number of scientists who believe that ESP is as worthwhile as reaching for the stars .
