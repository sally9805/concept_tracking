Canada this year faces bleak economic prospects : inflation is running at an 11.1% annual rate , production growth seems likely to be zero , and unemployment is expected to rise from the current 7.2% to 10% . One major reason for all this is a peculiarly vicious circle : to keep up with inflation , workers have been demanding huge wage settlements that fuel further inflation . Strikes have also disrupted production enough to increase unemployment more than the recession alone would have done . <P> In 1974 Canada lost a total of 9.3 million man-days of work as a result of strikes . Among the 24 industrialized , non-Communist nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , only Italy had a poorer record . This year the trouble is likely to be even worse . All together , 1.5 million workers will be affected by contract negotiations this year , twice as many as in 1974 . While the Canadian economy was booming and profits were high , as was still the case during 1973 and early 1974 , private and government employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that Canada 's economy is clearly slumping , bosses will be more frequently inclined to say no . Already this year , nurses , schoolteachers , dockworkers , airport firemen , traffic controllers and runway maintenance crews have walked off their jobs . <P> During the last quarter of 1974 , Canadian wage boosts averaged 17.2% , more than twice the typical American raise during the same period . Pacts signed so far in 1975 have provided increases ranging from 29% to 80% over the next two years or so . The increases have forced up the price of some exports and consequently reduced their competitiveness in foreign markets-a serious matter for a nation that depends on exports for 30% of its gross national product . And the walkouts have been crimping the economy directly . Last fall , for example , grain handlers on the west coast around Vancouver struck for seven weeks . They returned only after the Canadian Parliament imposed a settlement and after Japan and China had shifted some orders for grain-Canada 's most important export-to the U.S. and elsewhere . The national postal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that some mail sent in November is only now being delivered . Sorters in Montreal post offices continue to stage wildcat strikes in hopes of winning a gargantuan 71% pay increase and halting automation . <P> On Schedule ? Currently , walkouts are threatening Canada 's plans to serve as host for the 1976 Olympics , scheduled to be held in Montreal . Strikes and stoppages have so slowed construction of a new 70,000-seat stadium and other Olympic facilities as to raise a question of whether they can be ready in time . Last week , while the International Olympic Committee , meeting in Lausanne , Switzerland , received assurances from Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau that the games would be held on schedule , construction workers in Quebec and at the Olympic construction site struck yet again , this time mainly to protest a blunt , 603-page report on corruption and crime in four Quebec Federation of Labor unions . The Quebec government had already voted to replace tainted leaders with government-appointed trustees .                 @ @ @ @
