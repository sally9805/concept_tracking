txt Mayor Beame called on Governor Carey yesterday to name a special prosecutor to investigate the nursing-home industry in order to " allay any possible questions in the minds of the public . " However , he emphasized that he had " full faith and confidence in the integrity " of State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz . In other developments over allegations of abuses , frauds and political influence involving the industry . CA former assistant to Assemblyman Andrew J. Steih said that he , too , had been told by Stanley Steingut , Democratic leader of the State Assembly , not to investigate homes owned by his friend , Bernard Bergman , head of a vast network of nursing homes and central figure in the investigations . Mr. Stein , Democrat Liberal of Manhattan , is chairman of the State Temporary Commission on Living Costs , which has been investigating the nursing home industry . ( Assemblyman Stein said Mr. Steingut should not be elected Speaker of the Assembly " because of his proven involvement with the Bergman empire . " Mr. Steingut said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minuscule " and termed inaccurate a ' State Health Department mem orandum that indicated he and Attorney General Lefkowitz had interceded for Mr. Bergman . Mr. Steingut also predicted that he would be elected as Speaker . , 4Governor Carey said he would receive a report 9n the situation from Secretary of State Mario Cuomo this weekend and ' would then " take whatever steps are necessary " to carry out his inaugural pledge that " those who mistreat our elderly people for gain will feel the full force of an outraged people . " qMr . Lefkowitz , while withholding comment on the Health Department memorandum , said he had been conferring with Mr // Cuomo and appeared to imply that he was prepared to hand over the task of prosecution o nursing-home frauds , which he had assumed two weeks ago . ( Raul Curran , United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , assigned two aides to determine " what if any Federal action is appropriate . " ( The Synagogue Council of America , representing the three main branches of American Jewry , condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A brief statement issued by Mayor Beame yesterday de-clared : " To allay any possible questions or confusion in the minds of the public , I think that it would be in the best interest of the people that a special investigator be appointed by Governor Carey to look into questions of nursing homes as well as related activities . " I want to emphasize , however , that ! lave full faith in the integrity of Attorney General Lefkowitz , which he has demonstrated over his years of service to the people of his state . " Mr. Beame had declined to reply to repeated requests by The New York Times in recent weeks to comment on allegations of massive frauds involving Medicaid payments , which are shared 50 per cent by the Federal Government and 25 per cent each by the state and city . He had said he would comment next week , after conferring with health and welfare officials . But a Mayoral aide said yesterday that Mr. Beame , in light of the allegations involving Mr. Lefkowitz , believed a call for a special prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had conferred several times with Mr. Cuomo on " plans to assure the most thorough investigation " of the nursing-home industry and said a decision would be announced next week . Stein Called ' Liar ' On Wednesday , Assemblyman Stein aid Mr. Steingut had warned him in 1973 not to look into homes owned by Mr. Bergman . When informed of Mr. Stein 's charge that day , Mr. Steingut called Mr. Stein " a God-damned liar . " Yesterday , Orin Kramer , a former legislative assistant to Mr. Stein and now executive assistant to the New Jersey State Treasurer , said that in early 1973 , when he began investigating what he called bad care in a number of nursing homes in New York City , Mr. Steingut warned him to stay out of Bergman homes . Referring to Mr. Steingut , Mr. Kramer said : " After the first visit , Stanley called me . I do n't remember his words , but effectively , he told me that I should exclude Bergman from my investigation . " He was n't concerned that was investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to Bergman . " Mr. Kramer said he received several such calls from Mr. Steingut over a period of weeks , and " he was very disturbed . " " The real problem , " Mr. f Kramer added , " is that this kind of conflict of interest is legal . As long as people in public office are allowed to have private interests , this sort of thing is going to happen . " In a statement yesterday , Mr. Stein said his allegation about Mr. Steingut was " absolutely and totally true , " and he added that " Mr. Steingut 's links with the Bergman empire " would be " thoroughly explored " at joint hearings of his Temporary State Commission on Living Costs and a subcommittee of the United States Senate , Committee on the Aging . " The real issue here is that thousands of elderly people are receiving terrible care and the taxpayers of New York are being ripped off to the tune of millions of dollars a year , " he said . " I feel that Stanley Steingut should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bergman , empire . " Mr. Steingut 's nomination as Speaker by a Democratic caucus next Tuesday has been regarded as assured . While 18 Congressmen from New York have appealed to the Governor to act vigorously on nursinghome abuses , nearly all members of the State Legislature have been silent on the issue thus far . Interventions Made In the past , a number of legislaors have intervened with the State Health Department in behalf of nursing-home operators . Among them were Assemblyman Albert Blumenthal , West Side Reform Democratic who ? has been deputy to Mr. Steingut and is slated to become majority leader . Mr. Blumenthal was described in a memorandum by Dr. Andrew C. Fleck Jr. , First deputy state health commissioner , as having joined Mr. Steingut and Mr. Lefkowitz in defending a Bergman project against charges by inspectors that the project did not conform to codes and that Mr. Bergman was unfit , by his past record , to operate it . Other Fleck Memos Among many documents released Tuesday by Dr. Fleck describing interventions by legislators for nursing homes was a 1973 memorandum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Martin Ginsburg , Republican of Nassau County , who was convicted last week of perjury about influence peddling as a judge . " Mr. Emery was quite candid in indicating that he , along with former Assemblyman Ginsberg , represented the interests of Mr. Al Schwartzberg . " Mr. Schwartzberg , a major promoter of nursing homes , assigns much of his insurance to Mr. Emery , as Mr. Bergman assigns some of his to Mr. Steingut . Mr. Emery has not been reachable for comment , and Mr. Ginsberg has said he could not ecall the matter . Another document from the Fleck file reported that famished patients from a Schwartzberg home had " rung doorbells begging for food . " Penciled notations by state officials indicated that they believed many of the complaints . The Synagogue Council of America , in a statement signed by the heads of six major . religious organizations , said recent revelations about abuses in nursing homes were " particularly distressing to a religious community that has taught the special reverence that is due to the elderly . " Warning Sounded " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly and fully by appropriate authorities , " it said . " We welcome the investigative reporting that has brought this situation to light . At the same time , we must be on guard against the tendency ? by providing gratuitous information ? to tarnish entire segments of the community . " Rabbi Henry Stegman , executive vice president of the council , said the last sentence reflected concern in some Orthodox circles about publicity given to the status of Mr. Bergman as an ordained , although not practicing , rabbi and as a world leader of the Mizrachi Religious Zionist movement . State investigators have charged that ' Mr. Bergman and Eugene Hollander , another nursing home operator , made illegal donations ? of Medicaid funds from nursing homes to Mizrachi and ' other Orthodox groups . The pre  --  tige of their connections with respected organizations has been described by state officials as a factor in averting prosecution of charges against them in the past . Rabbi Seidman commented in a telephone interview : " The allegations suggest that these people have exploited the religious ? community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
