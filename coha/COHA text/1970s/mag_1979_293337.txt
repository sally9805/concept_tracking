THE AMITYVILLE HORROR <P> Directed by Stuart Rosenberg <P> Screenplay by Sandor Stem <P> This is a highly melodramatized version of Novelist Jay Anson 's allegedly factual bestseller about a nice normal family who moved into a haunted house on Long Island and then found themselves psychologically terrorized by things that go bump in the night . It has become one of the summer 's top grossing movies despite the fact that the people who made it seem to have been of two minds about their story . On the one hand , they are tediously documentary about every odd manifestation of the unseen world at work , and the accretion of these minor incidents is so dully presented that we begin to long for a good scare . On the other hand , when the film makers try to assuage our restlessness , they swing too far in the other direction . James Brolin , as the father on the verge of being devilishly possessed , does so much eye rolling that in the movie 's sober context , he appears ludicrous . The absurdity is heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the family priest . who first suspects that something 's rotten in Amityville . <P> The result is not chills , but an uncontrollable desire to break into laughter , so lacking is the film in properly gothic suspense . Margot Kidder is chipper and pleasant as the puzzled wife resisting her worst suspicions about the demons in her dream house , but she can not overcome the film 's ineptitude and lethargy . The movie 's creators should either have stuck to the facts , ma'am , or they should have invented something to scare the pants off us . As it is , they have managed merely to bore them off . - R.S.
