THE STEADY HUM of Interstate 25 I barely intrudes on the plush interior of the El Dorado . Cheech &; Chong and Los Cochinos rise smoothly from the stereo tape . A joint gets passed slowly from Renal-do , the driver , to Tony , to me , and back . The white leather of the Cadillac shimmers and glows , and soon one feels ensconced in a soft , luxurious capsule watching the opening scene of a new American Western . We float along in a penumbral world between the interior luxury of the car and the harshness of New Mexico outside , between the endless undulating prairie on our left and the rising walls of mountains to our right . We glide past bursts of rocky mesa pushing out of the dry land and float over dried-out arroyos . We turn gradually , rolling toward the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at the southern tip of the Rockies , and approach a tough little **25;2999;TOOLONG town that sits on the edge of the plains and leans into the foothills of the Cristos . This is Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the biggest town between Raton , 109 miles north on the Colorado border , and Santa Fe , 70 miles farther west . But that 's not its distinction : Las Vegas is the most wide-open narcotics town in the Southwest . Tony presses a button inside the Cadillac and his window slides noiselessly open . He snorts the fresh , cold mountain air . We all stir . " You can get high just on the air in this state , man , " he says , and we laugh . Getting high is Tony 's business . He 's a major drug dealer , and he 's developed a solid market . In the past three years , the number of addicts in Las Vegas has tripled . In New Mexico , say the state police , the number of 32 addicts has also jumped threefold since 1970 . So Tony knows mountain air is n't everything . Tony buys in Denver and sells in Las Vegas . His shipments come from Mexico in campers or small airplanes . " We sell Chicano smack , from Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . Back East you get white smack cut with white sugar . There 's never been no white smack here . Just my top-quality Chicano smack . " As we glide into town , Tony pops open the glove compartment and pulls an old but smoothly working Mauser pistol from its wooden holster . He snaps back the bolt , cocking the pistol . We are all very alert now . " This is still a frontier town , man , " Tony explains . " You can easily get shot up here . " The New Mexico State Police agree with Tony . " We have n't got a man to put in Las Vegas , " Sgt. George Ulibari of the NMSP narcotics division told me . " No one wants to work there . It 's a rough town . That 's one Jack Shepherd , former assistant managing editor of Look , is a free-lance writer who has lived in Las Vegas , New Mexico . reason that the traffic 's so heavy . " Renaldo drives slowly down Grand Avenue , the main drag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Great Western Motel , Texaco , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Mobil , the Chamber of Commerce . The town started in 1823 as some adobe houses around a central plaza . It was tough even then : Vincente Silva robbed and murdered here , Jesse James and Billy the Kid felt safe enough to soak in the hot springs four miles outside town . By 1879 , it was a bi1'dy frontier town of saloons and gambling halls , and vigilantes held daily hangings from a windmill in the old plaza . Tony and other dealers operate in and around that plaza today . " We just drive the shit down here in complete freedom , " Tony says . " There 's no arrests and no prosecutions . " But there are precautions . Renaldo drives the Cadillac into an old adobe garage off a dirt road outside town . He and Tony disappear into a two-room adobe house with freshly painted blue shutters and a rusted corrugated-steel roof . The house is like many in the western part of town . Las Vegas divides into two worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and historic with its plaza , adobe houses , the San Miguel county courthouse ; Chicano self-help projects like Nosotros , Juntos , SalvaciOn , and La Salida in storefronts along National Avenue . To the east , across the narrow and often dry Gallinas River , lies the newer Las Vegas , with the Safeway shopping center , the Daily Optic newspaper , banks , New Mexico Highlands University , tree-shaded streets and concrete-and-wood homes . The two worlds ? largely old Chicano and new Anglo ? have a tradition of deep distrust and political antagonism . Until 1967 , they had separate governments , school systems , police and fire departments . Consolidation has not brought reconciliation . Tony , who had been wearing a city suit , returns dressed in his " workin ' clothes " ? a worn checkered cowboy shirt , dungarees , boots , and straw cowboy hat . He drives a black Ford pickup around Las Vegas , and looks as if he belongs there ? which , in a way , he does . " I buy ten ounces of smack at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pickup and head for the plaza . " I cut it here and deal it out to my men . If pushin 's your thing , right here you can make a couple of thousand a week at least , $2,000 a week easy in nickel and dime bags . If you 're deal-in ' a couple of ounces , you can make $1,000 a night . " In a dirt-poor county with 13.2 percent unemployment , that 's not bad . EW MEXICO HIGHLANDS UniverI say , the oldest in the Southwest , is on a rise near the Old Town plaza . Its architecture is Contemporary Penal Colony , and most of its 2,300 students regard the university that way , too . James Neilsen ? a minister who abhors being called " Reverend " ? is a tall , bright , and soft-spoken instructor in education and a counselor of student psychological problems . He 's also one of the new directors of Las Vegas 's second attempt at a methadone program , called La Salida . " Narcotics is a life-style among some kids in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of drugs for a long time . There 's a lot of joy-popping , and some students are addicts . " An application for federal funding for La Salida , written in May 1973 , agrees : " Las Vegas ... has developed an explosive drug abuse problem , aggravated by the fact that a university is located in the community .... Many local people have returned from other urban settings , and from military service in Viet Nam 203 at NM111.1 , where they had a previous addiction problem and have continued in this pattern . " The La Salida report estimates that there may be one hundred addicts in Las Vegas . SalvaciOn , the first , controversial methadone program , had seventy addicts when it collapsed last April . ( La Salida replaced it.1 Andy Vigil , chief of the Las Vegas Police Department , puts the number at " about sixty-five known addicts in town , and probably another sixty or so not in any program and not known . " By national and even state standards , sixty to one hundred twenty-five addicts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well documented by Chief Vigil ? is the impact of these heroin addicts on the townspeople . The La Salida report detailed this impact : " In merchandise stolen from stores , homes and vehicles , for example , it now costs the overall community between $20,000 and $30,000 each year for every addict on the streets , who must resort to crime to support his increasing needs . " Those figures may be high . But Chief Vigil , who keeps excellent statistics , says , " When we get a rise in burglaries we see it related to heroin use in the majority of cases . " Is he seeing an increase in heroin use ? " Hell , yes ! " he says . " Heroin , when it started up three years ago , tripled the crime rate . " In 1972 , for example , robbery in Las Vegas went up 300 percent . Through the fall of 1973 , the amount of merchandise stolen every month in Las Vegas averaged $18,760 . " We may not know the level of habit , " says Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV a day is not going to satisfy it . Even as few as fifty addicts in a community of this size , ripping off two color TVs a day , create a major burglary rate . " Albuquerque has the highest crime rate in the nation . It does n't bother them . But here the community 's so small that it 's hard not to get hit . I know people who 've been hit five , six times . I have neighbors who are afraid to leave their home to drive over to Santa Fe . The two or three times they did leave , addicts came in and stole everything . " " If we were seeing a burglary ring , " says Chief Vigil , " they 'd clean out some place , not just take one item and run . We have had a lot of little jobs , but no major ones like in the past . We 've had just one major burglary in the last three years . Now everything is below $5,000 . " Take August . Tourists cruised along Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south and west to Santa Fe , Albuquerque , or Phoenix . Schools opened on August 24 , but Highlands students were n't expected back for a month . August began with a stolen bicycle and hubcaps ripped off a car . On August 2 , one woman came home to find a window broken , and the television set , an AM-FM stereo radio , a clock , and appliances gone . A dry cleaners got taken for small cash . On August 4 , jewelry and a radio were stolen from another house , an oil company got hit , and a woman lost a pistol and tape recorder . Anything left out overnight got lifted . On August 6 , three ten-speed bikes went , along with four lawn chairs and eight tires . The next day , someone robbed the Santa Fe freight office , someone else grabbed a purse from a shopping cart in the Safeway , and a third thief a wallet , which was later found on the Highlands campus with fourteen dollars missing . On August 8 , a tourist from Tulsa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tools also got lifted . In the next few days more than $850 in cash and merchandise disappeared . August 15 , 1973 , was typical : five spare tires were stolen , as well as a thirty-two-caliber pistol , a ten-speed bike , batteries from four cars . a handyman jack worth $30 , a tool box with tools ( $60 ) , a twelve-volt battery ( $25 ) ; a clothing store was robbed , and a break-in at an elementary school netted two speakers ( $15 each ) , a science kit ( $150 ) , and a microscope ( $65 ) . On August 16 , a Maryland man picked up a hitchhiker who pulled out a twenty-two-caliber pistol . The driver lost his watch and $500 in traveler 's checks . Not everyone traveling through Las Vegas got off so easily . Mr. and Mrs. John Martinez left Denver on August 22 to go to California . Unfortunately , they paused in Las Vegas ? the Interstate is n't finished and travelers must pass through town on Grand Avenue . The Martinezes stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , punched them , and stole $130 . And so it went . A car , more ten-speed bikes , tools , stereos ; the State Cafe was robbed of $110 by two men , one with a dagger . Another thief took the battery from a school bus parked at Armijo Elementary School . The month 's end was typical also . Four tourists stopped in town on their way from Colorado Springs to Santa Fe . Someone pried open a window of their car , and stole eight suits , a camera , their wallets , In ail , August yielded a pretty good haul . Stolen goods totaled just under the monthly average : $18,002.44 . Fifteen homes were robbed ( ten at night , five during the day ) for $3,284 . Eleven stores ( five at night , six during the day ) got hit for $4,133.80 . Eleven bikes were stolen , and four cars . Most interesting , Chief Vigil keeps a robbery category called " miscellaneous , " which includes such items as television sets , radios , stereos , household appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the largest category month after month , occasionally falling second only to stolen cars . In August 1973 , $5,665 worth of " little stuff " got ripped off in Las Vegas ? a good indication of the constant burglarizing of homes and people in town . September was no different : robbery up 34 percent ; assaults up 50 percent ; burglaries up 48 percent over 1972 . " When I was growing up , " says Elaine Marquez , " this was a safe town . We used to just latch the screen door at night and leave the other doors open . But they beat up a little boy down my street recently . Now , you 've got to lock your doors and watch out . You ca n't trust anybody . " 1 71 THY IS THIS HAPPENING in Las I Vegas ? For one thing , there are no state or local undercover police working on narcotics in the town . The New Mexico State Police have just twenty-six agents covering a vast state with 3,000 addicts in it , and a long international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four agents . ) No undercover agents have worked in Las Vegas since Steve Martinez resigned last September to join the state police . " It 's very risky work , " Martinez admits . " We 've had contracts put out on people in this area . One of our informants was nearly killed in prison because he was helping us . " Martinez grew up ' in Las Vegas . " Las Vegas is probably the most wide-open town in the Southwest , " he claims . " If the money 's available , you can make a buy every time . If not heroin , cocaine . If someone wanted to buy a pound or two of heroin in Las Vegas ? and that 's a lot ? he could , easily . " In New Mexico , fencing stolen goods can be lucrative . Even a New Mexico state senator has been fin gered as a fence . " You can rip off a ten-speed bike , take it to Albuquerque , and trade it off for some smack , no questions asked , " one addict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very attractive business , " says Sergeant Ulibari of the state police . " A pilot flying for six hours into Mexico and back can make $18,000 . A dealer here can make $100,000 a year . " N ICKEL AND DIME BAGS of heroin in Las Vegas , as everywhere else in the United States , reach the street junkie wrapped in aluminum foil . After the heroin is cut and divided among the dealers , it gets sold quickly around the plaza in Old Town . I talk to a young girl , a university student who also deals . " There may be ten dealers in Las Vegas in all , " she says . " I may be one of the biggest , 1 may not . I cut my shit and my mules run it . I make , say , $800 a week getting the shit to my mules . I use the hungry kids ? seventeen , eighteen ? because if they 're too young the narcs can always break ' em . At eighteen , a kid thinks he 's immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they ca n't . " Tony 's heroin , carefully cut and wrapped , really jars the economy of Las Vegas . " Some addicts push maybe $200 to $300 a week , " the girl continues . " They get to keep $20 to $30-10 percent ? and $30 in six nickel bags'or three dime bags'worth , for their use . That keeps them coming back to me for more . And there 's a strong sense of security in handing out $300 worth of smack . You 're the messiah with the loaves ? the supply seems endless . " Another dealer adds : " You can live , really live , in this town for $150 a week . Making $500 , $800 , $1,000 ? man , you have chicks all over you day and night . " Tony and I drive the girl dealer to the Old Town plaza . A cluster of kids around the bandstand breaks up , and a few come over to the pickup truck . The girl sells " caps " to one kid , who turns and deals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old building , filled with young kids , on the southeast corner of the square . The girl makes another sale , and another . I corner one buyer , who is reluctant to talk . Tony lifts his shirt and shows the kid his Mauser tucked inside his belt . How does he operate ? ask . The kid talks : " I fence . I deal . I steal a little . My honchos go in fast and grab whatever they can , and get out . At night they send the little kids ? five , six ? around to the houses . You can tell who 's at home and who is n't . People leave signs . The kid knocks on the door . If no one answers , they knock it over . " Tony and I watch the girl finish selling . She 's making a lot of money , and the three of us walk back outside to the pickup feeling flushed with success : Tony 's been paid a pile , and the girl , too . As we sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tony pulls out his Mauser and sticks the barrel into the girl 's left ear . " Let 's have the bread , " he demands . The girl looks terrified . I 'm in a cold sweat . But she 's tough . " No , " she answers firmly . " Okay , " Tony smiles . " Then how about your ass ? " " It 's a deal , " she replies , and smiles back . N 1970 , FIVE HEROIN ADDICTS from ILas Vegas began driving the 254. miles round trip to Albuquerque for methadone from a program there called Quebrar . But federal red tape caught up with them , and , as outsiders , they had to stop . A few weeks later , Dr. Thomas Lowry in Las Vegas started another program , at the state hospital . Thirteen Las Vegas addicts got methadone there until July 1971 , when Dr. Lowry resigned and moved away , and the hospital administration declared that it was short of staff and federal funds for the program . Las Vegas addicts then circulated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred townspeople signed , and SalvaciOn started in November 1971 , in an old bank building on the plaza . Things went bad quickly . Steve Martinez , the ex-undercover agent , recalls : " Informants told me that there was a guy here in town involved in dealing in heroin and methadone who was a member of the methadone program . " Also . there were persistent rumors about bad management at SalvaciOn , and misused methadone . In February 1973 , Leroy Montano , a " narcotics specialist " with Salvacidn for fifteen months , was arrested twice , once for receiving stolen property and a second time for burglary . The numbers of addicts wanting help also gave SalvaciOn trouble . Says one Las Vegas businessman : " It had little outside surveillance . It was funded for fifteen or so addicts , and had seventy . They never turned anyone down , and they did n't screen very well . " George Wallace , the community service coordinator at the New Mexico State Hospital outside Las Vegas , who helped start La Salida , believes that SalvaciOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over the administration of a sensitive program to people with little or no training in that area . They broke down under the pressure of administering that program . There was fiscal mismanagement by accident . I do n't think anybody was ripping anybody else off . " Still , when the state moved in and took over on April 13 , 1973 ? in a statewide move by Gov . Bruce King because of stricter federal regulations on methadone ? the Optic reported that they found " a fiscal mess . " SalvaciOn closed . George Wallace and others dispensed methadone at the state hospital during the summer on a temporary-basis . The Highlands University Campus Ministry , the sponsor of La Salida , applied for federal money to cover the proposed $65,605 budget . By late September , La Salida had opened a storefront clinic near the plaza . La Salida began dispensing methadone from the storefront in October . " We 're seeing approximately twenty-six addicts , " says Lorraine Mares , La Salida 's full-time , $12,000a-year director . " We believe that number will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt as far as burglaries are concerned , " Chief Vigil says . " Some guys arrested in burglaries are in the program . " Getting arrested ? and convicted ? in Las Vegas is n't too likely . " There 's just been no prosecution , " Steve Martinez says . Vigil is equally outspoken . " We ca n't get any prosecution . It 's nil . Politics has a helluva lot to do with it . We do the undercover work , make a case , arrest . We present the case to the DA , and that 's it ? dismissed . " DA Jose E. Armijo , seventy-two , who has the size and temperament of a bantam rooster , has been in office only eight months . He decides who faces prosecution and who does n't in San Miguel , Mora , and Guadalupe 36 counties . Armijo has a scruffy cluster of offices in the county courthouse a block above the Old Town plaza . He denies Chief Vigil 's charges . " I 've had quite a few narcotics prosecutions , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few . There are n't many cases of heroin . It 's not found around here . Mostly it 's the marijuana . " There was a major bust last March , when federal narcotics agents bought several thousand dollars ' worth of heroin from Las Vegas dealers , and no one got prosecuted . Armijo ca n't remember this . Says Vigil : " We felt bad , real bad . They found so much heroin in town . They even bought three ounces in one buy . " Instead , Armijo fingers his predecessor , Donaldo " Tiny " Martinez . " You know , " Armijo says conspiratorially , " there were considerable complaints about his lack of attention to the duties of his office . " Donaldo Martinez , fifty , was DA for sixteen years before Armijo unseated him by 201 votes out of 13,723 cast in November 1972 . ( In 1968 , Martinez won by just 7 votes out of 12,580 , after a recount . ) Before Martinez , Armijo had been DA for twelve years . ( They 've run against each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martinez and Armijo have held what the Optic calls " this power-laden post " for the past twenty-nine years . And , when not in the DA 's office , Martinez and Armijo practice law in town . Martinez was a highly controversial DA . Armijo says he beat him in 1972 because Martinez " had become too powerful , dictatorial and tyrannical , and the people got tired of it . " Perhaps . The Optic described Martinez as " a militant liberal and an advocate of . . . many stormy unpopular causes . Proudly he labels himself ' Chicano . ' Martinez defended Reies Tijerina , the Chicano who took over federal lands at gunpoint in 1964 . In 1971 , Martinez also bailed out several Brown Berets ? members of a paramilitary Chicano organization ? who had been arrested in Santa Fe and charged with disorderly conduct and carrying concealed weapons . " Tiny " invited them to Las Vegas , and , as chairman of the West Las Vegas School Board as well as DA , he housed them for a month in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to prosecute Chicano narcotics addicts . " I did n't treat these arrests as criminal cases , " he admits , " unless it was for sale and distribution , and even then more than just an isolated sale . I treated them as a social problem . Mostly , I worked with them myself . I 'd counsel with them , for one thing . I 'd try to get medical help and attention for them . " Martinez admits that he was n't very successful , but insists , " This is an illness , not a criminal activity . " Martinez is also skeptical of the methadone programs . " That 's just transferring them from one addictive narcotic to another . The kids on methadone continue to shoot up . This is a nationwide problem . It 's a business that 's as big and as widespread as the telephone company . It 's no different here than anyplace else . Heroin is being used not only in Las Vegas . We 've now got kids coming in from the rural villages and ranches and farms.71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Andy Vigil is under pressure to halt the rip-offs , and one town councilman has called for his resignation . " They 're really more concerned about the burglaries than about the people committing them , or the reasons why , " Jim Neilsen comments . ONY WAITS FOR THE LIGHT to lchange , and pulls into Grand Avenue , toward my motel . " This town 's consuming about half a pound , eight ounces , of smack a week , man , " he explains . " That 's at $1,000 an ounce . Break that down to nickel and dime bags and you 've got a town consuming smack at $6,000 to $10,000 a week . Let 's say about $8,000 in heroin sold every week in nickel and dime bags . Some guys have been cutting it more than that . But we eighty-sixed one of those dudes , and that ended that . We want to keep good-quality Chicano smack . " Tony pulls up by my motel . " I can make about $5.000 to $8,000 a week in coke and smack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I get to half a million , I 'm going to buy me a ranch , or maybe get into one of them Texas land deals . I 'm gon na let the younger dudes take over ? there 're enough of them hustling here already . " " And then what ? " I ask . " Me ? " Tony smiles . " I 'm just gon na sit back and get high on mountain air . " He drives off laughing .
