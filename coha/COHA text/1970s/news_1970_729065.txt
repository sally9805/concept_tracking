Truman and a group of high military officials gathered in the White House Rose Garden to pay tribute to an Army general retiring after 50 years of military service . The distinction of the 0Cr.W.1011 went beyond the length of iite retiring officer 's service . Brig . Gen. Benjamin 0 . Davis Sr. had been the first black man in American military history to reach the rank of general . The tributes from the Com // mander in Chief and the pomp and ceremony of the occasion marked the end of a career that had begun in the SpanishAmerican War and that had spanned two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a temporary first lieutenant during the Spanish-American War and , when it was over , enlisted in the regular Army as a private . After being sent to Manila , he advanced to sergeant . Admiring what they considered his fine soldierly qualities , his superior officers won for him the right to take an examination for a permanent commission . He placed third in the examination and became a second lieutenant of cavalry in the Regular Army in 1901 . Despite General Davis 's considerable military talents , his subsequent advancement up the ranks would have been little noticed among the general public had it not been for the color of his skin . After fighting through the Philippine Insurrection , he gained his first lieutenant 's bars in 1905 . Before World War I , he taught military science at Negro colleges and served in Mexico . By the outbreak of World War I , he had advanced to lieutenant colonel . During the war , he was with the Ninth Cavalry in the Philippines .

A number of Army officers made no secret of their conviction that the promotion , just before the 1940 Presidential election , was a political move by the White House to influence the large Negro electorates of the important states of New York and Illinois . In support of their contention , they noted that Colonel Davis was being made a general at the age of 63 , not too far from retirement age . Those who held this view also maintained that the promotion was " an appeasement " to pressures from such groups as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which had been campaigning against discrimination against blacks in the military . Whatever the case , the promotion marked a milestone in the history of American blacks and of the American military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his age but he was immediately called back to service and attached to the Inspector General 's Office . In 1942 , he went to Europe to work on easing racial tensions in the Army . For his efforts , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal . After the war , he worked for an end to racial discrimination in the military , declaring that the work of the Army would be " seriously impaired if any racial group is withheld from full participation in its overall mission . " By then , his son , Benjamin 0 . Davis Jr. , was himself advancing through the officer ranks in the Air Force , on his way to becoming the second black man to achieve general rank in the American military . The younger Davis , who retired from the military as a lieutenant general early this year , has been serving since September as Director of Civil Aviation Security in the Department of Transportation  --  a post set up to spearhead the drive against airplane hijackings .
