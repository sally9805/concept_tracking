E VERYBODY CLOSE TO Winnie 's center was in motion . Fred , no kid anymore , was doing what he 'd been doing for three years , crisscrossing the country , following  --  he told her in collect calls from Phoenix or Fargo ? " leads . " That is , friends , often met the week before , who had houses to build , acres to plant , jobs to offer , places to crash . Then it was arrival , and , weeks , or days  --  twice , hours  --  later , departure . For every amical ointment , a fly . " The guy lies around all day getting wasted . Good drugs is all there is here , ma . A bad scene . " Failure of mission reported to Chicago , Fred would be on the road again , thumb cocked , life 's accumulation in his rucksack , the Ideal Address summoning him from a few miles , a few states away . " I 'm down to twelve bucks . But I do n't want anything , ma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty-four . At twenty-four , Winnie had two children and two degrees , and was supporting four people selling lots in the South Side of Chicago . Supportee Number Four was the Greater Frederick rounding the last turn of his eight-year doctorate . The Great One had passed to his namesake blond charm , the gift of living off women , and  --  might as well face it  --  a deep tract of sheer dumbness , a power of self-delusion from which contempt or dislike washed easily . ( The Fredericks could n't be snubbed . ) " Stick anywhere , Freddy . Build up a stake before you move on . You have to eat lots of dirt before flowers bloom in your face . The planet offers no perfect situations . " " I stuck New York , ma . " Five months in the Newsweek morgue , long enough  --  to the day  --  to qualify for battered New York 's unemployment compensation . Eighty dollars a week , which , with his girl 's salary , gave him the life of not Riley but Oblomov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . Spectacularly . Twenty-three thousand dollars , fourteen on one daily double . " You know the way accountants look at a sheet of figures and see the shape of corporations . Ma , I look at those dope sheets and I see the race . " Close to six-and-a-half feet , 190 pounds , the green eyes glistening with this Dummheit . Yet the pudding had proved out : twenty-three thousand . " Freddy , now it 's time to take the journalism course . Go up to Columbia . " i " It 's not the time for that , ma . " " Look , Fred , it never hurts for anyone to talk to a counselor . Why not spend a few bucks and get your head cleared ? Find out what you 'd be best doing , why you 're not doing it . " " But I am doing it . " She sensed he was going to stick the money in a hole , not report it to the IRS . " Fred , the tax men are everywhere . They get reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every dollar lights up those computers in Virginia . Do n't wiggle . " Was she trying to subdue the divinity of idleness , she who 'd burnt offerings to its opposite number since she was nineteen ? All those mortgages and leases smoking in the golden nostrils . Fred went to Aqueduct ; he 'd never seen the track itself before . The actuality needled his balloon . " All these burns in funny hats coming up to me for tips . I 'm standing around in my Kenyon sweatshirt , and they 're asking me . " ( It was another sliver of his pride that no one in New York dressed as badly as he did . He was like the man in Chekhov identified as " Luhov , the one who lost his galoshes at the Balanoffs ' . " ) Winnie ? What did I do wrong ? Was it the writing ? He knew I was writing the book . " Tom was finishing a doctorate , writing on the nature of evidence in psychoanalysis . One section recorded his own interpretation of fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's notes on the same sessions . It would be a unique document , real material for students of the profession . But Culp slammed the door . The impassive , lunar face which had dominated Tommy 's dreams for two years burned with rage . While Tom was on the couch , Culp called Dr. Fried and told him he thought it was time to turn Mr. Hiyashi over to him . Tom fainted , was revived , staggered up the hall , and found two doctors and three cops ? " with guns , Win . " Would he sign himself in , or did he prefer to be committed by Culp ? " You were signaling you wanted to be hospitalized , " Culp said when he finally agreed to talk to Tom . A MONTH LATER , in a manner hidden from and hardly credible to her , Freddy was down to seven thousand dollars , six of which he put into a mutual fund . " I 've been studying the Street , ma . " ( He 'd watched Wall Street Report on the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventh thousand , he " cleared the post , " left a girl , an apartment ( the lease had two months to go ) , and a phone bill which Winnie , his permanent address , paid , and headed  --  tailed was a better verb for Fred  --  west . " I might have a day with you in Chicago , ma . But Jack 's in a hurry . He 's got a pad in Sonoma County , he says there are millions of jobs in the wineries . And it 's more beautiful than the south of France . " He did stop for a day , but she was just moving in with Tom . Fred never liked her boyfriends , and he missed the old apartment ; so he and his two pals ( the third had been picked up in Ohio , a Marx-bearded dreamer who ate one of Tom 's plants ) stayed only a night . " There 's no place in Chicago for me anymore , ma . " It 's a big city , Fred . You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't see where I 'm at . " Fourteen inches shorter , plain and dumpy as a muffin next to this green-eyed giant , Winnie could n't bring herself to ask where he was . He was so hugely there . Besides , she had alI she could handle now with Tommy . The reason she 'd moved in with him after twelve years in her own place was his desperation . A month before , he 'd been " dumped " by his analyst , and had imploded , collapsed . He could n't get out of bed . The black pearl eyes which just sat out on his gold cheeks , dropped tears down them . " Why did he do it to me , wINIFRED COT TOM OUT . She went to Professor Klugerman , he found someone to sign for Turn , and then he gave her the word on Culp : Chicago was littered with his wrecks ; he 'd been a promising young man , but his own problems had ruined him ; he was okay when the transference was rosy ; when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told them he could n't work with patients who 'd been hospitalized . Psychoanalysis is the best-protected fortress in the world : its stones are invisible . Even with a Klugerman on one 's side , a malpractice suit was next to impossible . Anyway , Tom was too low to think of litigation . For two years , all the feeling in the world had been held in by the four walls of Culp 's office . Now he 'd never see him again . " Analysis may not have the power to cure , but it sure has the power to hurt , " he said , tears dropping on the gold cheek-flesh . " I ca n't think of anything else , Win . " Even now , two months after Winnie had moved in , five weeks after he 'd started with Dr. Fried , Tom 's head was a Culp museum . He drove to Winnetka , parked near Culp 's house , stared at his wife and children , took pictures of the garden , the ears . " Win , yesterday I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic sack of garbage , and I wanted it . " " Oh , Tommy . " " Maybe because I was his garbage . And I gave him all mine . I gave him all the muck in my head , and he told me to get out . He 's supposed to take it . An analyst is an incinerator plant  --  no , a recycling plant . But he cycled me out . How would you feel , Win ? " " I know , Tommy , I know , " stroking him , the handsome little blacktop head , the beautiful lit-tle shoulders . She knew a little anyway . She 'd been dumped as well , and not by a passing stranger . The Greater Frederick had taken his degree , acknowledged " its essential ingredient , my wife , " and four years later , just starting to make enough money so she could stop making it and concentrate on her poetry , he discovered that " everything on this earth has a term , " they " had had the best of marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of ' fresh fields and pastures new , ' old Win . " Of course he 'd been plowing the new pasture for a year . Stroking Torn , Winnie remembered her own obsession with Rosanne , looking her up , what a shock , a scrawny kid , rearless , breastless , with a nose that hooked wickedly towards her teeth . A classic Frederickan delusion . ( Line up . Rosanne ) . Eight years , they lived five blocks apart . So the move to Tommy 's had the relief of that separation as well . And maybe some of the relief of Freddy 's moving : moving for its own sake , though she believed what she 'd quoted at him from Donne , " there is motion also in corruption . " " Corrupt , ma ? " " No , Freddy , it 's just that motion is n't necessarily healthy . " " You could sell it to Weight Watchers : I always lose five or six pounds a trip . You should try it for that alone , ma . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had . " Lose enough , you can fit in an envelope , mail yourself to yourself . You 'd never catch up . Ride round the earth for the price of a stamp . Need the dime ? " " You 're some punkins , ma . " Harshness slid off him . ( He always regained his five pounds . ) The move did occupy her , and it blurred some of Tom 's shock and the brevity of Freddy 's stay , and then Nora 's hysterectomy , which came ten days after Freddy left . Win had " never been close " to Nora was what she told friends , what she thought , but of course that was too easy , Nora had been in her belly and at her breast , she 'd loved her wildly , as she 'd loved Freddy . But when Great Frederick took off , Nola , though she stayed with her mother , took off , too . Eight years old , and Winifred would see the green eyes flashing chill at her , the unvoiced indictment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't good enough to hold it . Are you what I have to be ? Is that what a girl is ? Someone Left ? " But over the phone , Nora wept , she was never going to have her own child , and Winnie took off for Denver and held Nora 's blond , Freddian head on her breasts , she must n't worry , she and Francis could adopt ten babies , it was the right thing to do in this 1970s world ; the hysterectomy was a sign her system would have trouble with babies , she would have all the joy  --  and almost all the difficulties  --  of children , the genetic part was insignificant . She stayed two weeks , doing chores , keeping cheerful , even had the first good talks of her life with Nora , it looked as if at last they would be friends . But toward the end the new grievance must have revived the old . Win looked up to the green eyes flaming at her . " You do n't know your own nature , momma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . " " No . If you knew where you were , what you are , things would n't happen to you all the time . You 'd happen to them . " Nora , white as a bathtub , with only the large green circles for color . " I 'm not much on all this knowing thyself . That 's what our Fredericks are after , or say they are . ' Where 's that Great Phone Book in the Sky with my number in it ? ' What 's the point , Nora ? Look at Tom . " Nora never wanted to look at Torn . " Ten years on the S. S. Couch , and what 's his America ? Shipwreck ! ' I 'm too busy for that , ' as Pat Nixon told Gloria Stein-em . Right on . And if you want better authority for burying the self , go to Jesus . Or Buddha . Or Jane Austen . George Eliot . Did they squat around , asking who they were ? " But Nora would write no book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nora . You 're right . " It was time to go . Francis took her to the airport . " I can be back in hours if you need me , Francis . " " You 're a brick , Win . " Endless , vague , unbrieklike Francis . S OLID , MAYBE DUMPY , WINNIE , yes , a bit of a brick ; on her own , had put the two children through lab school , college , had moved more South Side noncommercial real estate than anyone in the city , could have had her own firm , been a rich woman if she had n't hated being a boss ( firing people , fighting the IRS ) . She was a brick and then some , a lot of bricks , and some windows , doors , and not a bad interior , ask Tom , ask a few discriminating human beings . But in need of tuck-pointing , chimney-work . Mornings , waking up next to Tom ( unless he was out casing Culp 's breakfast ) , her head was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market the leavings of the great ( Picasso 's shaved hairs , Elizabeth Taylor 's sweat , a bottled ounce for eighty bucks ) ; or she 'd discover Jesus 's Autobiography : " The Word first ? No . Words come from throats . I was born in almost the usual way . In a backwater town . " Breakfast up here was nice . Tom 's place was across the street from Wrigley Field , and in the morning , or on days there was no ball game , the neighborhood felt as if it had fallen out of the present tense . The streets zoomed up to the great oval and died ; the silence was spectral . There were lots of Koreans and Japanese around ? they 'd come from California after World War II . The small business streets had a special feel , old ladies bowing to each other , the kanji script on the hardware and grocery stores suggesting intense messages from over the clouds . Shinto shrines and rock gardens behind standard Chicago threeflats . Ball-game days , the morning silence thickened toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and car parkers warmed their throats for the crowd , which dribbled and then poured in under the windows . What was that crazy mass they celebrated in the oval , the little white grail pounded and pitched ? She sat in Tommy 's ' greenhouse " room , doing her accounts , or reading poetry , or just dreaming of something happening , something working , Freddy settling in , Nora taking care of a baby ( knowing what feelings you just could n't allow yourself , feeling the lovely depth of a total dependence ) , Tom shifting the hump of trouble from Culp to Fried . A stillness in others . So that her own motion would count . She did n't want ease , she was even tired of not being tired , of trouble washing too easily out of her system . ( Inside she was brick . ) She was n't ready to hit the road . ( What road was there ? ) Down the street was far enough . ..
