Kansas City , Mo . The Democratic midterm convention here was a dry run for 1976 , with candidates rushing from caucus to caucus , plying delegates with liquor and fighting for floor passes for staff . The ostensible purpose of the gathering ? to institutionalize procedural changes that will " open up the party " ? was shoved into the background until the closing hours . Most of those decisions had been made earlier and had been endorsed by most of the party hierarchy , including National Chairman Robert S. Strauss , the Great Unifier , Of course reforms have to be implemented , and that was what the last-minute argument at Kansas City was about . Blacks , women and Latinos were upset because of a phrase that said that the makeup of a delegation to the national convention was n't " prima facie evidence " of discrimination . That was the language that had been adopted by the Democratic governors , who assumed it was agreeable to the three groups . It became apparent here that it was n't . Leaders of the three caucuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers , Machinists and American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , who in turn went to the governors to complain . National Chairman Strauss , long known for his fidelity to elected officials and determined to have a unified convention , agreed to support whatever the governors decided . At the prompting of Florida 's Gov . Reuben Askew , the governors agreed to a compromise that took the objectionable language out and won the backing of 80 to 90 percent of the delegates . The mini-rebellion was over . Arizona 's Rep. Morris K. Udall was the most visible presidential candidate and probably made the most progress . He did it on a meager budget of $4000 , not an inconsiderable feat since the campaign reform law he played a role in passing limits each presidential candidate to spending no more than $10 million through the national convention . Ten million dollars sounds like a lot , but it does n't allow for frills : a serious candidate has to save a minimum of one million dollars for the California primary alone . Udall threw no parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muehlebach and a booth at the auditorium . For visibility he stocked both with buttons and plastic shopping bags . No one else thought of anything that inexpensive . Hundreds wore his buttons . ( The supply ran out the first day . ) His staff is pushing " voluntarism " and put it into practice at Kansas City . Only four or five had their way paid . Another 70 to 80 came here on their own . Since Mondale 's withdrawal Udall 's strategy has shifted to that of a front-runner . He is already committed to entering the New Hampshire primary , and a good half of its delegation here was boosting him . His next stop will be Wisconsin where Gov . Pat Lucey and other party leaders are urging Sen. Gaylord Nelson ( D ) to get in the race . Few believe Nelson wants to be President badly enough , however , to go through a campaign , and Udall wooed the Wisconsin delegation with some success . One delegate said , " I 'd go with Gaylord but I 'm not sure he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Arizonan plans to spend several days in Wisconsin next month . It would be far from accurate to say that Udall swept the so-called liberal contingents off their feet . Many are convinced there 's room for another " liberal " in the race and they want to wait to see who it will be . It wo n't be McGovern , and probably not Birch Bayh , who dropped by the California caucus and received a rousing welcome , but he is n't pushing . Udall is convinced he ca n't be elected or even nominated if he dots the " i 's " and crosses the " t 's " to the liking of the intensely issue-oriented elements on the party 's left . At bottom he recognizes that his party is necessarily a coalition of diverse though not antithetical groups , and that in so varied and large a nation , no party can win that is not truly representative of national feeling . He intends to work out from the middle as the candidate most acceptable to the liberals . Nevertheless he ca n't just run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unity : unity is n't a platform but is the result of a program . And so Udall soon must identify his issues , trusting they will ring true to a majority . His reluctance to raise the liberal banner sparked talk here of a strategy of running a candidate such as Ramsey Clark , who could excite the activists and sew up delegates who then might be thrown to the most acceptable candidate in a brokered convention , perhaps even to Udall . Compared to Sen. Jackson , Udall was a smashing success . To put the Jackson reception at Kansas City in perspective , one must recall the scenario his backers had in mind . They had played a major role in replacing Chairwoman Jean Westwood with Strauss . The Charter Commission had been packed to their satisfaction . They were sure the reforms , particularly on affirmative action , would be gutted . They never thought the party 's " left " was for real and were confident of overwhelming it with the help of Al Barkan 's boys at the AFL-CIO , when it came time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected some help from the Wallaceites , who were gearing up for a major drive to send their people here . Nothing in that scenario found its way into the Kansas City script . Under the practiced hand of ex-Gov . Terry Sanford of North Carolina , the Charter Commission had put together a document that institutionalized the major McGovern guidelines . The week of the convention Strauss put his stamp of approval on that document and guided it through a special rules committee with a minimum of change . There was nothing left for such Jackson allies as Barkan to do but slip away quietly , which is what Barkan did . A friend saw him come into the deserted lobby of the Muehlebach Hotel at 7 am Sunday . He called out " Hi , Al . " Barkan turned to him , his mouth opened , nothing came out , and he turned to check out . There is some evidence that Jackson has lost ground , particularly across the South and Southwest . Many delegates with oil incomes or constituencies shook their heads firmly when Jackson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd Bentsen . In these areas Jackson and Bentsen are fighting for the same constituency and Bentsen is chipping away . Jackson still does command strong support . He was well received at the Illinois caucus , where Mayor Richard Daley called him " an outstanding American " and Jackson reminded Daley 's cheering charges that his state of Washington voted unanimously to seat the Daley delegation at Miami Beach . " I think we were the only ones who did , " Jackson said . Jackson did n't put on a mob scene at the bar as Bentsen did with his reception for 5000 , said to cost $20,000 . But a steady stream of delegates rounded up by several dozen Washington lawyer-lobbyists made their way through Jackson 's trailer in the exhibit area ( where Udall also - had a booth ) , picked up a drink or two and had snatches of conversation with the candidate . For charm , no one matched Georgia 's Gov . Jimmy Carter and his sons . The party 's happy warrior , Hubert Humphrey , was everywhere and always available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking like a candidate . Since most Minnesotans have come to believe there 's a constitutional requirement that their state have a candidate , and with Mondale out of it , Humphrey was pushing Gov . Wendell Anderson . Terry Sanford waited until Sunday afternoon to call delegates from the floor to ask them to head up his campaign . Sanford has a critical problem , however . If he ca n't whip Wallace in North Carolina , he ca n't be taken seriously . Yet his state 's primary comes too late , in the spring to use it as a launching pad for a national effort , so Sanford must decide whether or not to go national without first erasing his 1972 state defeat by Wallace . He is said to be inclined to wade right into the New Hampshire primary . Wallace had little impact here . His forces were able to elect only a handful of delegates . He had little power on the floor . He flew in early , greeted delegates and met the press in his suite on Friday , and then left before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he 'll be able to garner a lot more delegates from primaries in 1976 than he could in 1972 , the brevity of his appearance should give no comfort to his adversaries .
