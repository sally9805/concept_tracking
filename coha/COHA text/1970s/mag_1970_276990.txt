SEARCHERS AT THE GULF by Franklin Russell . 222 pages . Norton . $5.95 . <P> <P> Franklin Russell , 43 , is a tall , sturdy , New Zealand-born nature writer with the kind of rugged looks that excite casting directors for beer commercials . He has been called the most interesting and accomplished writer in his field since Rachel Carson . ( He is , in fact , far more accomplished ; The Sea Around Us and The Edge of the Sea were basically beads - of fact strung on a thread of prose that often strained for poetic effect . ) Unlike Miss Carson , however , Russell is not a sentry on the ecological DEW line . His books , Argen the Gull , Watchers at the Pond , <P> The Secret Islands , are imaginative attempts , rather , to convey to urban readers nature 's strict authority and rude justice . When man enters Russell 's work , it is usually as an intruder momentarily stripped of civilization and shivering in the face of unexpected atavisms . <P> The searchers at Franklin Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly following or seeking loopholes in the natural order . Although the geographic coordinates are fictional , the author acknowledges the gulfs resemblance to Canada 's Gulf of St. Lawrence . " Either Gulf , " he comments , " may yield whatever a searcher chooses to find in it . " <P> Womb and Grave . The remark is cryptic but not gratuitous . For the success of Searchers is a fine balance between observed fact and unobtrusive metaphor . The insatiable giant cod who cruises through Russell 's pages not only passes ichthyological muster , but its instinctive cunning suggests a primitive form of wisdom , or even free will . Far above this predator of the deep , a white eagle inscribes huge parabolas in a futile search for food and a mate . Russell 's details are hard and clear , but the irony is left for the reader to dislodge . The eagle-a cliche for freedom-is incapable of adjusting to an environmental change that has scattered his food supply and chances for procreation . <P> Set to the rhythm of one year , Russell 's gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death is " quick , bright , forgettable . " Life multiplies with an almost ludicrous optimism . Clouds of plankton feed small fish who in turn are eaten by flounder , mackerel and cod . Big fish chase small fish to the surface , where they are either gobbled from below or grabbed from above by shrieking birds . Shreds of flesh drift to the sea floor to nourish crustaceans . <P> Though he was once a world traveler , Russell now lives on an old farm in New Jersey 's Delaware River Valley with his wife , two boys , a couple of aging Siamese cats , and a pet starling named Bronstein , which , Russell claims , imitates creaking doors , balky auto engines and knows how to say , " It 's time to go to the supermarket . " There Russell studies and writes about nature , trying to draw from its complexity an eternal truth : that no action in life functions without regard to other life .                 @ @ @ @
