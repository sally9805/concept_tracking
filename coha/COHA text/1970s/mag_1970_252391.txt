War is the supreme test of man , in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity . <P> - General George S. Patton <P> The arguments against war are too familiar to need repeating . In the dream of peace , they have been steadily heard along every step of mankind 's bloody and belligerent course . And yet war , not peace , has been mankind 's most faithful companion . In 35 centuries of recorded history , only one year out of 15 has not been drenched by the blood of the battlefield .

Is there something in what Patton says ? In short , can a case be made for war ? <P> The distressing answer is yes ; civilization itself is inconceivable without it . This , at any rate , is the conviction of British Sociologist Stanislav Andreski , * one of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate for Mars . Such agencies as the Rand Corp. , the Hudson Institute and others annually spend millions exploring Andreski 's thesis . For war is group rather than individual behavior ; and since it is undeniably a fixture of human society , the question that Andreski implies begs for an answer : What purposes can war possibly serve ? <P> " It is an unpleasant truth , " Andreski writes , " that , human nature being what it is , without war civilization would still be divided into small bands wandering in the forests and jungles . " He contends that " advanced civilization with extensive division of labor can only arise within a large and fairly dense population engaged in peaceful exchange of goods and services . There could be only one way in which small tribes could be welded into states and small states into large ones : namely , conquest . " <P> Moreover , he credits war with producing , or contributing to many of civilization 's most treasured fruits . Among them :           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
