THE most hopeful factor in the Middle East crisis is the attitude of the two superpowers that stand behind the antagonists . Last week , in unmistakable words and diplomatic signals , the U.S. and the Soviet Union told their respective allies that it was time to stop stalling and get on with negotiations . <P> The strongest words were those of Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev , who publicly threw Russia 's support behind the peace efforts . " It is very important for the peaceful forces in the Middle East not to let the initiative slip away and not to allow the foes of peace to blow up the agreement or use it to cover up their aggressive designs , " Brezhnev declared in a nationwide television broadcast . He strongly backed the Arab cause , but warned the guerrillas to refrain from troublemaking . Said Brezhnev : " What is needed is not new provocations and subterfuges designed to circumvent or violate the ceasefire agreement , but an honest observance of the agreement reached . " <P> Brezhnev 's remarks came three days after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join with the Soviet Union in policing the Middle East ceasefire . The idea of a joint Soviet-American guarantee for a negotiated settlement was offered by Administration leaders at San Clemente during a background briefing of Western editors and publishers . The U.S. suggestion drew immediate and harsh criticism from Arab and Israeli diplomats alike . Administration officials hastily emphasized that it was nothing but speculation and that the Russians had not even been consulted about the idea . Nonetheless , some diplomats interpreted the suggestion as an American trial balloon for an imposed settlement in the event that the present cease-fire erupts into a new round of fighting . <P> The concern of the superpowers reflected the fragility of the Middle East situation . Early last week indirect United Nations negotiations got started under the coldly evenhanded direction of Gunnar Jarring . In the first meeting , Israel 's U.N . Delegate Yosef Tekoah reiterated his country 's complaint that the Egyptians had broken the terms of the 90-day cease-fire by placing Soviet SAM-2 and SAM3 missiles in position on the west bank of the Suez Canal . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing that he was flying home that very night for consultation with his government . <P> Bitter Disappointment . The Israeli delegate 's sudden departure was caused by growing tension in the coalition government of Golda Meir . The Israelis are deeply concerned about the U.S. 's relaxed stance toward the alleged Egyptian violations of the ceasefire . Israeli Premier Golda Meir declared on television : " Had we known that things would develop as they have , with the Egyptian contravention of the ceasefire , we would not have agreed to enter into the peace talks . We have been bitterly disappointed . " Israel Galili , the Minister without portfolio who is Mrs. Meir 's closest adviser , told TIME Correspondent Marlin Levin : " The relations between Israel and the U.S. today are marked by tension and worry . If the U.S. does not see to it that the elements of the cease-fire are fulfilled , the conditions may be created - God forbid-that would cancel our decision to accept the cease-fire.
