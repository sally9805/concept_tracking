Cambodia and Kent State triggered protests ' on many campuses around the nation , including Portland State University , at Portland , Ore . There , striking students erected barricades in the streets surrounding the campus and set up on the Park Blocks , an esplanade which runs through the campus , a large canvas shelter , which they called a " hospital tent . " After some debate , little of it heated , the barricades  --  which had kept no student from going to class  --  were dismantled . Except for a few minor incidents , which the police on the scene shrugged off , there was relative calm , The only real symbol of the strike remained the hospital tent . The student demonstrators asserted that they had received verbal permission to keep the tent up until May 12 , the day following the removal of the barricades . But the Mayor , Terry Schrunk , egged on by City Commissioner Francis Ivancie , a hard-line right-winger , dispatched the tough , battle-geared TOP ( Tactical Operation Squad ) cops , trained for riot duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The TOP Squad advanced upon the tent and ordered the students around it to disperse . The students locked , arms and remained firm and quiet . The commander of the TOP Squad then announced that " those who do n't disperse , consider yourselves under arrest . " When the students held their ground , the cops charged , cracking heads , beating a man with his own crutches , jabbing their clubs into the stomachs of ' women , and flailing the fallen . When a high police official was later asked why the students had n't been arrested instead of being clubbed where they stood , he explained ' that it was too much of an ' inconvenience to arrest the students and that there was n't enough jail space for them . Newspaper and TV reporters at the scene were shocked and outraged , but when they reported their observations they were subjected to a flood of abusive calls and letters . The mail which poured into City Hall was overwhelmingly pro-cop , and if any regret was expressed it was that , not enough blood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . Some citizens did protest the police action , however . These included Portland State " jocks " who had been gung ho for law and order until the TOP Squad 's busting bee , and a small group of courageous women . In response to these protests , the Metropolitan Human RightS Commission , a standing body appointed by the Mayor , launched an investigation of its own . Its finding 's , released recently , revealed that the students did indeed have permission to keep the tent up until the next day ; that three police captains at the tent had " all advised against its removal " ; that " no attempt was made to effect arrests at the tent prior to the use of force " ; that the police " erred in the method used to remove the tent " ; and that " the TOP Squad employed violence in a nonviolent situation . " The Human Rights Commission also concluded that the police acted in violation of Oregon state law , in that " no attempt was made to effect ' arrests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " , The Mayor , previously shaken by the bloodletting and the switch of " jocks " into the ranks of the protesters , said he would study the report . VOTING OUR POCKETBOOKS ROBERT W. DIETSCH Mr. Dietsch is with the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance in Washington , D.C. The big issues in the Congressional elections of November 3 are the war in Southeast Asia ( it is assumed , at this writing , that the United States will not become directly involved in any Middle East fighting ) , " law and order " and the pocketbook . The greatest of these is the pocketbook . " If you scan the political fever charts , " long-time political analyst Louis H. Bean once wrote , " You are forced to two broad conclusions : one , that there is a general tendency for people to vote along traditional lines , which holds election results within certain percentage bounds ; the other , that the greatest variations in voting behavior , the greatest shifts from one party to another , are associated with pocketbook ' issues . " Because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has failed , during nineteen months in office , to stop the squeeze , this year 's pocketbook situation should bring joy to the Democrats . In a sense , the Asian war remains the overriding issue . It sits on the minds of all Americans , one way or another , but it may stay more in the public mind than on the political tongue during fall , campaigning ' . From the view of the Democratic , Party ( which , belatedly has confessed to supporting the war for far too long ) , no ' poll has yet shown that forthright opposition to the fighting is the most profitable political position , particularly ( as Tom Wicker has written in The New York , Times ) if it appears to involve an American military reversal or a diplomatic humiliation . Thus if a Democratic candidate cries ' " End the war , " he risks the Republican response that Mr. Nixon , unlike his Democratic predecessors , is winding down the fighting . And if a Republican candidate argues that his Presiderit is winding- down the fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may . expect the Democratic response that American boys are still being killed , , that Mr. Nixon has n't fulfilled a pledge to end the fighting , that he has indeed widened the war into Cambodia . There are exceptions to this general rule , as a few primaries illustrate . But those can best be explained by individual candidates and special situations and , not by the war in toto . As for " law and order , " the Vice President is leading the GOP attack , charging the Democrats , with being " soft " on crime and appealing to " blue-collar hard-hats " to come on over to the Grand Old Party . Republican National Chairman Rogers C. B. Morton says the Dem* ocrats , particularly Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , are only , " posturing " on the side of law and order , having " switched " on the issue " to save their bacon . " Nevertheless , the Democrats can be observed slamming the radicals and violence , and it 's probable that they will be able to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton . Whatever may be said and done about law and order , the campaigning will come back to the pocketbook . " The economic issue , " Sen. Edmund S. Muskie said recently , " is the big one . " There is a shape to , the pocketbook issue along campaign ' trails : The Republicans blame the ' shrinkage on Demogatic big spenders in ' Congress , claiming that they upset the President 's , " economic game plan . " But for people interested  --  and theie really are n't that many along Main Street ? Nixon 's , " economic gathe plan " re-mains as nebulous as his Vietnamese game plan . In turn , THE NATION / October 19 , 1970 the Democrats can point out , with what looks like increasing certainty , that Nixon 's fiscal 1971 budget will wind up in the red by more than $10 billion . No - poll shows that voters are much influenced by budget deficits ( or surpluses , for that matter ) , but again to those willing to listen the Democrats can point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted by the " big spending " 91st Congress totaled $1.4 billion less than ' - predicted by the Republican White House in May 1969 . Besides , a case might be made that ' a number of Republicans joined in voting for items  --  principally schools and housing  --  that were vetoed by the President ; also that the drive to hold down spending was n't helped by Mr. Nixon 's efforts to spend billions on things like the SST , ABM and ailing railroads . The Democrats point to the pocketbook facts : When-Nixon was sworn in , unemployment was 3.3 per cent ; now it is 5.5 per cent ( the highest since January 1964 ) and rising . There are 4.3 million Americans listed as unemployed today , and thousands more may be on that list by the first Tuesday in November . What 's more , some of the 80 million still employed are working less overtime , and thus taking home less pay , and not a few shiver lest they may be next to feel the ax . The General Motors strike already is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less willing to buy and take on tew debt . Thirty-five cities are now counted as having 6 per cent or more unemployment , the highest total in - more than five years . A Commerce Department survey shows that 13 per cent of households have less real income today than they did a year ago , and 20 per cent less than when Mr. Nixon took over . Increase in the cost of living has slowed down , but there is little sign that a plateau is in sight . The wholesale , index shot up by 0.4 per cent in September , and the chances are that on November 3 , the price of most consumer items  --  everything from hamburger to housing , milk to medicine , cars to clothing  --  will be a bit higher than they are today . In Mr. Nixon 's first nineteen months of office , the cost of living zipped up about 9 per cent . Little wonder , then , that Lawrence F. O'Brien , the Democratic Party chairman , also thinks the pocketbook will be the issue this fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very sick economy . Certainly we have a recession in the midst of spiraling inflation . " Perhaps recession is too strong a word , but whatever the semantics , Nixon 's economists have counted on a resumption of consumer spending , particularly on " big-ticket items " ? cars , appliances . So far , consumers are keeping their hands tight on their wallets . ? Behind all this there is more than a smattering of poor economics and party politics , It really is economical nonsense to blame Richard Nixon for all the pocketbook squeeze . The real villain in the case is Southeast Asia and the refusal of Lyndon Johnson and the 90th Democratic Congress to advise the public that , for its economic welfare , it would have to put guns ahead of butter . But for campaign purposes , economic arguments need not be profound . Furthermore , a case can be made  --  an economics case  --  that ' Mr. Nixon 's " game plan " to cure the nation 's business ills was halfhearted at best , and that such halfheartedness increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President eschewed both " jawboning " and wage-price controls . When the economic chips were down , the President refused to accept the possibility of a deeper recession . At the first sign of a big jump in the jobless rate , he released $1.5 billion of highway construction money  --  an action which , did n't really involve very many dollars ( as compared with a $200 billion federal budget ) but which gave businessmen and consumers a renewed conviction that inflation was here to stay . Just when " inflationary psychology " had begun to wane , Mr. Nixon rekindled the fires . Also , at the first major sign that business was in a financial bind , the Federal Reserve Board ( headed by Mr. Nixon 's good friend , Arthur Burns ) opened the money gates . Again , inflationary fever rekindled . An economic " Fact Sheet , " distributed by the White House to editors not long ago , claimed that the Administration " had only two real tools to use against inflation:monetary restraint and fiscal restraint . " That is nonsense . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls . Even " jawboning " continues to be too much for Mr. Nixon , although his " inflation alert " policy flirts with that idea . And the government could have ? acted ' to influence the prices of a handful of household items whose price increases lead . the list of squeezes . For example , the President has authority to permit . more foreign beef to enter the country , and had he so acted , the price of hamburger ( up even more than steak ) might have been kept , to some degree , in check , Had Mr. Nixon supported the idea of no-fault auto insurance he might have helped hold down the spiral in insurance costs . ? Had he supported some kind oU ' national health insurance plan he would have helped slow the rise in dentist and doctor fees and hospitl costs . Had he supported increases in textile imports ( instead of doing the opposite ) he could have dampened the price spiral in clothing . Histor1 and textbook analysis say the pocketbook issue should boost Democratic . chances in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent elections in Britain showed that the swing to the Conservatives was the strongest in the industrial urban centers , plagued by unemployment and rising prices ; women , directly ' responsible for protecting the family pocketbook , voted overwhelmingly against Labour . Consider also a Gallup poll which shows that Americans think , 44 per cent to 29 per cent , that the Democrats do " the better job of keeping the country prosperous . " Then there is Foley 's Law . Proclaimed by Duncan , K. Foley , an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , it asserts that there ' is " strong negative correlation " between unemployment and Republican success in Congressional elections , and that for each 1 per cent increase in the jobless rate , Republican House membership is trimmed by fifteen seats . By Foley 's yardstick , the GOP should lose thirty seats , since the unemployment rate in November will be about 2 percentage points higher than when Mr. Nixon came into office .                @ @ @ @ @
