There was the comfortably familiar rattle of cups and saucers and the gurgle of hot coffee in Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker 's office . Betty Ford nibbled a doughnut and declared it " delicious . " Lynda Bird Johnson Robb told Richard Nixon she missed seeing his daughter Julie . " Henry , are you as mean as ever ? " Nixon asked his former Secretary of State . " Yes , " replied Kissinger , who had arrived with Nelson Rockefeller . " But I do n't have as much opportunity as before . " <P> Ford and Nixon compared golf games , Kissinger and Nixon compared books . Jimmy Carter asked Nixon when he had arrived in town and how long he planned to stay . Lady Bird Johnson was especially sympathetic when she saw Nixon , and held his hand warmly . So did Majority Leader Robert Byrd . Almost with eagerness , Carter , Ford and Nixon followed Baker into an anteroom for a historic picture of the three . In a few minutes it was time for these people to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Not since Truman , Eisenhower and Kennedy came together in Bonham , Texas , at the funeral of Sam Rayburn in 1961 has such a gathering occurred . The love of Hubert Humphrey was the force . Howard Baker was the arranger . When he learned that Nixon and Ford planned to attend the Humphrey services , Baker invited both to gather in his office . Then he called Rocky and urged him to join them . Kissinger was going to be with the former Vice President , so he was included . Lady Bird Johnson was attending the service , so she too was invited . She asked to bring her daughter and son-in-law , Charles Robb , the new Lieutenant Governor of Virginia . With such an expected assemblage , Baker sent word to the White House that President Carter was welcome . He and Rosalynn accepted . <P> What would Nixon be like , what would he act like ? Almost everyone wondered . Nixon was hesitant about being there at all . Sunday morning a Nixon aide telephoned Baker 's office and said that if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader 's office for coffee . He would instead go straight to the Capitol entrance at the last second so that he would not encounter anyone important . Forget it , Nixon 's aide was told . Nixon was welcome . <P> Rockefeller , Kissinger and their wives arrived first . Then came Jerry and Betty Ford . Nixon was next , with his daughter Tricia . For a fleeting second there was tension . Nixon looked unsure , older than the group remembered him . He did not seem to be the man of impeccable tailoring they recalled . His trousers were even a shade too short . Then Ford and Kissinger went up to Nixon to shake hands . The unease vanished , talk began .
