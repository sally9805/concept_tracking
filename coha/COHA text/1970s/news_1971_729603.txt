txt The families of the two men who have lately walked on the frontiers of space live and work in an environment consecrated to the future . Yet they seem to possess elements of character that were first shaped in frontier America . This is not true in a merely general sense , but in the exact sense of their having brought into the present certain modes of the past , directly and traceably , thru their family lines . These families exhibit certain distinguished features . The man is usually boss in the home . The children are strongly disciplined . The adults are generally tho not unanimously , abstemious , rarely drinking and still more rarely smoking . Some of them give little or no quarter to dancing , movies , or television . They are buoyed by strong , religious beliefs  --  often of the Bible-toting , go-to/fr. meeting kind  --  and they profess to lean as much on prayer as on technology when one of their members goes off to the moon . A Lack of Fear The family members appear to be unflinching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they show a marked preference for strenuous outdoor pastimes such as skiing and water-skiing . These and other attributes are not necessarily typical of the astronauts as a whole , Maj. Alfred M. Worden , the crew member who stayed in orbit , is rather different from Col. David R. Scott or Lt. Col. James B. Irwin , Those who know them well say the behavior of astronauts and their families ranges over a fairly broad spectrum , from straight and square apple pie eaters to worldly men and women about town . No Television Set Irwin streaks oft toward the moon on a rocket 's nose , yet , he and his wife choose not to have a television set in their home for themselves or their four children . There is too much violence on It for their taste . An exception was made to this during the flight of Apollo 15 . Scott calmly and confidently addresses mankind from the surface of the moon , yet , according to his father , the 39-yearold astronaut still says " Yes , sir " and " No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket set tend to look as lean and stylish as members of the jet set . They have much the same casual assurance and zest for keeping on the go , and they scoot about in zippy sports cars , but then the similarities give way to differences . On the first Saturday of the space flight , at the hour her husband was taking his first moon walk , Mary Ellen Irwin stepped from her home to go to teach her weekly class of teen-agers in in the Sabbath School at the Pasadena Seventh Day Adventist Church , 20 miles away . A bystander asked her , in evident surprise , if she were not going to watch her husband 's exploit . " Jim is doing his duty , and I must do mine , " she said crisply and moved on . On God 's Mission To Mrs. Irwin , the Apollo 15 flight was , in a phrase , " God 's mission . " In separate and exclusive interviews , Mrs. Irwin and Lurton Scott , wife of the commander of the Apollo 15 , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their husbands came home last Sunday night . Both women quietly but steadfastly refused to make the decision without asking the men . The women express a sort of hazy contempt for the principles of " women 's liberation " ? hazy because their view of it is very distant . " I honestly have n't been able to figure out what they want to be liberated from , " said Mrs. Irwin . Some of the astronauts ' children had to be coaxed to abandon other pleasures long enough to watch the splashdown on television . For most of the children of the space families , orbital or lunar flight has been a part of life from their earliest memories and it is as common to their experience as the airplane or the longdistance telephone call is to most others . Hard to Believe This is not true of the astronauts ' wives or their parents , some of whom find moon voyaging conceptually hard to digest . Mrs. Scott does not believe that she will ever take a spaceflight to the moon , tho her 10-year-old daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . Her mother said : " I know they 've done it and I know how'hard Dave has worked . And yet I grew up with the expression ' as crazy as flying to the moon . ' And I still catch myself starting to use it . " You grow up thinking you ca n't do something and then that barrier is broken . You never yourself pass over it . I have n't . " Irwin carried with him to the moon a copy of a scroll signed by more than 800 members of the Nassau Bay Baptist Church , pledging their prayers for a safe voyage . Irwin is a member of this large Southern Baptist church . Town Grows Fast Nassau Bay , like so many things in Texas , has come a long way in a hurry . It sprang up almost all at once in fields and woods , and soon became a city with its own mayor , after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration set up its Manned Spacecraft Center here . The center stands close to a four-lane highway , Nasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom community , barely two minutes away . The humidity , ' frequently over 90 per cent in the blazing sun drives people to the air conditioning . Mrs. Scott , in cream tone slacks , sat with her legs curled up on an easy chair and sipped ice tea and talked for over an hour . The flight was over and two sets of compact receivers not quite as large as telephones , by which the wives were plugged into the talk between ground controlers and the spacemen , were silent now . One set had been installed in the living room , another in the bedroom . Sounds from Space While a mission is in progress , the boxes give off a steady , deep hum . The sound suggests an echo from the infinite void of space as a seashell held to the ear suggests the ocean 's roar . The hum is the background against which the wives conducted their daily affairs , escaping it only during sleep or brief errands outside their homes . " Did you rest ? " Mrs. Scott was asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I 'm not a morning person , and I normally have to get up with the children . I do n't like to , so in the summer I train them to hop up and fix a big bowl of cereal for themselves and turn on cartoons . They usually allow me to sleep until 8 or so . Did n't Follow TV " I did find when I 'd wake up and roll over and look at the clock I could not go back to sleep like I normally do . The first thing on my mind was , I wonder what they are saying , so I 'd get up and go over and I 'd turn on the box and then I 'd crawl back in bed and just lie there and listen . " " Did you have fear ? " " No , I really did n't . I do get kind of clanked at lift-off . But I was much calmer on this flight than in the other two my husband made . " " What about the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5,000 degrees ? " " You were listening to the people on the TV , " Mrs. Scott said . " You see I never listen to them during flights . They 're ogres of all kinds . They always tell all those horrible things that can happen . And I 'm just a supreme optimist . I feel like there 's just no point in worrying about things ahead of time . " Well , I ca n't say I never thought about the possibilities because you have to be realistic and you know what could happen , but there 's no point in dwelling on it because you 're not going to change it . If it happens , it happens , and you can face it then . " Faith was a steadying factor . " Religion to me is something very private , but I would have to say my religious faith has given me strength , " Mrs. Scott said . " That is probably why I am the way I am . Maybe in not worrying . " The Scotts are members of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestryman . Furniture from Europe They were married in 1959 and they have two children , a girl , Tracy , 10 , and a boy , Douglas , 7 . They . had their home built to their own specifications and , Mrs. Scott said , " Of coure , we built it with our furniture in mind . " The rooms are attractively furnished with modern Danish pieces bought in Copenhagen when the astronaut was a fighter pilot in Europe . " I feel a definite closeness to ' spare the rod , spoil the child , ' " Mrs. Irwin said . " I had a lot of lumps when I was a child . Apparently , it straightened me out , tho I was a bit of a rebel there for a while . " Couple Are Painters " I was raised in the church and I was always conviced that it was right , but I was never converted , " she continued . " It was n't until about three years ago that I was converted . It was thru the rude awakening of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord knew that it would take a great jolt to turn me about-face . " Mrs. Irwin is a painter of skill , and the family living room is lined with oils , including a seascape with waves crashing over rocks , a huge green butterfly , and a bird that began as an abstract painting but was shaped into a surreal parrot . Her husband paints ably , too , and a work of his in the French impressionist style hangs nearby . " You enjoy skiing , handb al 1 , and squash , fishing , diving and camping  --  is that right ? " Mrs. Irwin was asked . " And tennis , sailing , swimming and hiking , too , " she quickly appended . Mrs. Irwin has a square jaw , pronounced cheekbones and a wide smile . She has a lively sense of humor , sometimes of a slyly mischievous turn and sometimes with a dash of sarcasm In it , and she displays at times a firmness that would not be easily put down . Wants TV Out " I told Jim before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't upset me , " she said . " I was very happy that he was able to achieve his goal at such an early age . " The 40-year-old flier had been turned down twice for the astronaut corps . " The mission is not what scared me at all , " Mrs. Irwin said . " It has betel beautiful . I knew it would be , What 'll ? completely unglued me is the mass confusion in this house . You just sit down and go bananas with it .. Three different telephones in the house ringing , the front and back door ringing , kids going in and out . " " I can hardly wait to get ft out of here , " Mrs. Irwin said of the television . " I see no sense in sitting my four children in front of the television to watch how to kill one another . " " Our country really disturbs me over some of the things that politicians do and it disturbs me being at war all the time , " she said . " And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it with . We 're not a God-fearing country anymore , and we 're not raising our children to be God-fearing . " Maj. Worden , the man who stayed in orbit while the others surveyed the moon and later ventured outside the spacecraft on a " walk " of his own , had once told his mother that he would " give his right arm " to fly into space . His parents , Mr. and Mrs. Merrill Worden of Jackson , Mich. , where Maj. Worden was born in 1932 , were interviewed in their son 's two-bedroom garden apartment . Maj. Worden is divorced and his bachelor quarters are furnished with glass cube pieces and shining-stainless steel appointments . On the top of his refrigerator there is a hand-sized , exact model of the Apollo landing craft . Brothers Are Fliers His father has been a " movie projectionist all his life , " the astronaut ' . mother said . His brother , James , flies charter aircraft and his brother , Jerry , is a captain in the Air Force . Worden had spoken after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being stranded in space , with no way home . " We knew that , too , " his mother said very quietly . " The whole family went down to see him off . His brothers and sisters and his father and daughters . " As she spoke , she seemed near tears . " We went out to launch site at 5 a. m. , most of us , " Worden said . " He was all suited up and carrying his life support system , but he did n't have any helmet on yet . " " I had been told it was impossible for him to fall off , but I did n't believe it , " Mrs. Worden said of her son 's trip outside the spacecraft . " I sure was glad to see him back , inside . " Time for a Drink Maj. Worden burst in , smiling and jovial , after a long day 's debriefing at the center . " Well , it 's been a big day ? I need a drink , " he said , offering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokes cigarets , but he did not smoke on the voyage and he did not notice it or seem to need it then . His two daughters , Merrill , 13 , and Alison , 11 , live less than a block from their father 's apartment with their mother , now Mrs. N. James Clinton , who works in an art and gift shop at a shopping center . The Wordens were divorced two years ago . The astronaut , articulate and jaunty , dates actresses and secretaries , but keeps his lively social life within the bounds of the long hours and exacting discipline required in his work . On Tuesday night , barely three days after his hero 's welcome here , Maj. Worden sat at his dining table , under a big picture of the moon , eating a chicken dinner alone .
