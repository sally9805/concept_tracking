" You mean the whole time ? " " That 's right , " said Jordon . " And after , till you get around to go to college , if you like . " " Well , gee , it 's a small town where you live , is n't it ? " " It 's a small town , " Jordon admitted , " but it 's a nice town , right on the seashore . There 's swimming and sailing . And you 're only about half an hour from Boston . " " But what would I do all day long ? " " You 'd get a job , " said Jordon promptly . " What kind of a job ? " asked the young man cautiously . " Maybe in a bank . " " Hey , that 's kind of cool . " Despite the lateness of the hour , Jordon chose to walk back to his hotel rather than order a cab . He exulted in the thought that his son would be living with him . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He heard the grating of a key in the front door lock . He called out , " Is that you Billy ? Come in , come in , boy , the door 's unlocked . " He rubbed his hands and smiled as the young man entered . " How 'd things go at the bank today ? All right ? Anything unusualhappen ? " " Unusual ? No , sir . " " Well , that 's the best way , I guess . The regular routine . Oh , case I forget , tomorrow when you go in , would you look up Johnny Cunningham 's account and let me know how it stands . " 4 " OH , BEN , I LOVE IT . I SIMPLY LOVE TT . " MIMI SEGAL WHIRLEDaround like a ballerina pirouetting , her arms outstretched , her head lifted , her blond hair flowing in the crisp autumn breeze . She squinted against the reflection of the sun on the clawing wavelets . " There 's a sign there on the beach that says Private . Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , " said her husband . " The lot goes down to the beach so the beach must be part of it . Those houses on either side , they each have paths leading to those little landing docks , so I guess these lots include the adjoining part of the beach . " " How did you find it ? And how do you know it 's for sale ? " He smiled fondly at her . " While you 've been going in to Boston shopping , I 've been wandering around the area . " He was a good bit older than she , fifty to her thirty-eight , so there was a touch of the avuncular in his affection for her . " I saw this place when I walked out to the lighthouse yesterday . " " But how do you know it 's for sale ? " she persisted . " Anything is for sale if the price is right . " He turned to where the car was parked and called out to the chauffeur . " Hey , you know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided along with the car by the Rohrbough Corporation , shook his head . " I do n't know , sir . " " Well , they 'll know in town , " Segal said to Mimi . " Let 's walk along the beach and see what it 's like . " He put his arm around her waist , and because she was taller than he and was always worried that he might be self-conscious about it , she bent her head to rest on his shoulder . He was of average height , but she was tall for a woman , like a fashion model . It was her second marriage , and she had met him shortly after she had managed to free herself of an alcoholic husband . She had had doubts when he had indicated22that he wanted to marry her , mostly because at forty-seven , he was still a bachelor . What was wrong with him ? Why had n't some woman grabbed him up long ago ? He was not bad-looking . In fact , she decided she liked his sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his shock of iron-gray hair , she thought he was even distinguished-looking . So she had agreed  --  and had no regrets . " Are you sure this is what you want , Ben ? " she asked anxiously . " About building a house here ? " " About that , and well , everything , leaving Chicago , giving up finance to go into production  --  " He halted in his stride , the better to explain . " You plan and you maneuver and you finally bring it off and make a lot of money . But even more , there 's tremendous satisfaction in it . The second time , there 's satisfaction , but it 's not such a big deal . And then after a while , it becomes just another business . Because , you see , you know how to do it now . It becomes routine . Sure , there 's a lot of money to be made , but that 's all . " " Most people would say that 's enough . " He nodded . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , there 's no sense to it . I could n't spend it ; I never learned how , not the kind of money I was making . So I used it for leverage to make more deals  --  " " But what do other businessmen do ? " she asked . " Some of them make things , or transport them , or distribute them so people have access to them . That seems more worth-while . " " You do the same thing Bert Richardson does , and you 've alwaysadmired him tremendously . " " You bet . And do you know what he told me ? That he felt the same way . But what keeps him going , he told me , is that he 's got three sons , and he hopes maybe they 'll be able to make better use of his money than he has . Then I began thinking , there 's one thing 1 could buy with my money . I could buy a new lifestyle . A lot of men have that idea when they get to my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college professors , businessmen want to become artists or actors . Not many of them do . Most of them feel they ca n't afford it , or they 're afraid to take the chance . But here I am with plenty of money and sick of just putting deals together . Why should n't I try something else ? So I23started to look around , and when this Rohrbough proposition came up , I thought I 'd like to try operating it . " " I 'm glad you told me , Ben , " she said . " I was afraid you were doing it for me because of what I said once about wanting to live a normal life and be a part of a community . " " Then you do n't mind ? " he asked . " Mind ? I love it , Ben . " " And you do n't miss your friends in Chicago ? " " We have no friends in Chicago , Ben . Just business associates .

I 'll have the driver drop me off there , and you 'll go on to the hotel . We 'll get together around noon . " " How are you going to find out who owns it ? " " No problem there . I 'll ask at one of the local realty offices . They 'd know . Or I could ask at the bank . Look , baby , I 'll pick you up afterward , and we 'll drive up the coast and have lunch at some restaurant where they specialize in fish and seafood . I 've been hankering for it since we came .

" 5LAWRENCE GORE , PRESIDENT OF THE BARNARD 'S CROSSING TRUSTCompany , smiled appreciatively as Molly Mandell , his secretary , his executive secretary he would say , entered his office , a sheaf of papers in her hand . She was so brisk and efficient , so interested and willing , so sympathetic and understanding , that it was a pleasure to have her around . An attractive woman of thirty , she was neat and tidy in her navy blue suit . Her wavy brown hair was cut short and brushed back from her wide forehead . She had large dark eyes that were eager and alive . She had a no-nonsense mouth and a rounded chin which emphasized the oval of her face . And she was small . He liked small women because he himself was so cruelly short . Sitting behind his desk , his body visible only from the waist up , he seemed a large man . The long , narrow head with its thick blond hair and keen blue eyes was supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something of a surprise when he rose and one saw that he was only a couple of inches more than five feet tall . His eyes focused on the large plastic button pinned to her blouse . On it , in bold letters , was printed Women 's Lib . " Something new in costume jewelry , Molly ? " A sidelong glance at her bosom . " Oh , the state legislature is debatingthe Equal Rights amendment . The girls are wearing these to remind them where the votes are . " She placed the papers on the desk before him , and then taking the visitor 's chair , she watched him read the letters she had composed and typed for his signature . Teetering gently in his swivel chair , he read each in turn carefully , and then as he reached for his pen , he said , " These are exactlyright , Molly . You got just the tone I wanted . " 25 " You mean the ones about the silver ? Well , I do n't have the same appreciation for Peter Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the idea of the exhibition at the Boston Art Museum is wonderful , and I think it 's doing the bank a lot of good , too . " " Think so ? How about the display out front ? " he asked . " Are people taking notice ? " " Oh sure . It 's been getting a lot of attention . " She flipped pages in her notebook . " A Mr. Dalrymple asked me if you 'd be interested in looking at a vinegar cruet he has . He 's not a depositor . He just came in because he heard you had some pieces on exhibit in the bank . " " A vinegar cruet , eh ? Yeah . We 've got about half a dozen so far , but if he has a real good one , I 'd like to see it . " " I 'll get in touch with him . And Mrs. Gore called . She asked if she could have her check earlier this month . She 's going down to Florida to visit her brother . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded curtly . " Nancy asked if she could have Friday off . I told her we 'd be shorthanded because Pauline was n't due back until Monday . " " Quite right . " " She was a little put out . " " She 'll get over it , I expect . " She closed her notebook . " Henry Maltzman was in to make a deposit , and he asked me what action we were taking on his request for a loan . " " What did you tell him ? " he asked quickly . " Just that I 'd mention it to you . " He tapped the desktop with his fingers . " Graham says it 's out of line with his statement . " " Graham is a Scotchman , " she said scornfully . " He always says the loans are too big . If it depended entirely on him , we 'd never make any . " He chuckled . " You 've got a point there . " " And Henry Maltzman has been a good friend of the bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she went on . " You 're right , " he said . " One hand washes the other . If he should come in again today , tell him you think it 's all right . Do n't tell him I said so , because I do n't want him to think it 's official just in case the loan committee takes the bit in its teeth and de-26cides to overrule me . But you can kind of hint  --  well , you 'll know what to tell him . " " I 'll manage , " she said confidently . " I 'm sure you will . And now is there anything else ? " " You asked me to remind you of the Jordon report , " she said coldly . He noted the abrupt change in her manner and thought he knew the reason for it and was sympathetic . " Has he said anything  --  uh  --  nastyto you ? " " Oh , it 's not what he says . It 's just that  --  he 's a dirty old man . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a pass at you ? " " I mean he brushes up against me , touches me  --  accidentally on purpose . Is he very important to the bank ? " " Just our biggest account and a director . " " Well , one day you 're going to lose him  --  or me . " " Maybe if I talked to him . .. " She laughed . " Do n't bother . I can take care of him . I stood for much worse when I was working in Boston and riding the subway every day . " He grinned . " I can imagine . Well , try to stay out of his way . And now , how about the Cavendish report ? " " I was planning on working on it all day tomorrow . " " Hm . " He drummed a rapid tattoo on the desktop with his fingertips . " He called earlier and said he was coming in around noon tomorrow and asked if he could go over it with me at lunch . " " I could take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Could you ? Gee , that would be swell . You 're sure your husband would n't mind ? How is he , by the way ? " " Herb 's fine . He wo n't mind . He 's going to a meeting of the executive of the temple Brotherhood tonight anyway . " She laughed . " It 's my mother-in-law who might object . " " Really ? Why should she object ? " " Oh , she objects to anything I do , " she said lightly . " From her point of view , all my time outside of work belongs to her precious son , even if he 's not there . " She sat back and went on conversationally , " What really burns her up is seeing Herb setting the table and starting dinner . But he gets home from school at three o'clock , and I do n't get home until a couple of hours later . He does n't mind , but it burns her up . " " I suppose he has papers to correct , lessons to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free periods and study periods . It will be all right . " " Well , I sure appreciate it . And look , you can take time off in exchange . " " Oh , there 's no need , really . " She hesitated . " But next Wednesdaythere is a meeting and  --  " " And you 'd like to go . Plan on it . Take the afternoon off . Take the whole day off if you like . " There was a timid knock on the door . " Come in , " he called out , and the receptionist , a young girl with a ponytail and wide innocent eyes , sidled in , shutting the door firmly behind her . " Oh , Mr. Gore , there 's a man out there who 's just hanging around . I asked him if I could help him , and he said , no , that he just wanted to look around . I mean there 's nothing to see in a bank  --  " " Maybe he came in to look at the Peter Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just glanced at it . " " He may be a dealer , Elsie . They do n't like to appear inter-ested . " " Well , I thought where there was that bank robbery over in Scoville  --  " " You thought he might be casing the joint ? " He laughed . " What 's he look like ? " " Well , he 's an older man . I mean his hair is like gray . . . . " Molly had risen and opening the door had craned forward , the better to see into the lobby . She came back and with suppressed excitement said , " I think I know who it is , Larry . There was a picture of him the other day in the Boston Jewish News that my mother-in-law subscribes to . It 's Ben Segal of the Segal Group of Chicago , the ones that are taking over the Rohrbough Corpora-tion . " " You think so ? " He got out from behind his desk and went to the door . Over his shoulder , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month or a month and a half ago . See if you can find it in that pile on the table . " Molly began flipping through the magazines and almost immediatelycalled out , " Here it is . " He came back and studied the picture for a moment . " It 's him all right . " He said to the receptionist , " You 're a good girl , Elsie . " 28Then he strode through the office to where Segal was standing and said , " Welcome to Barnard 's Crossing , Mr. Segal . " Segal turned and stared . " You know me ? " " Only from your picture in Business Week . " He held out his hand . " But that was a month ago , " said Segal . " Sure , but it spoke of your interest in the Rohrbough Corporation , and anything to do with Rohrbough concerns us . I 'm Lawrence Gore , the president of the bank . We do the Rohrbough payroll , you know . " " I know . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some time . Look , it 's about noon . How about discussing it over lunch . " " Well , I promised to take Mrs. Segal to some nice seafood res-taurant . " " Splendid . We could pick her up wherever she is , and I 'll take you to the Agathon , the best seafood on the North Shore . How about it ? " " Sounds good , " said Segal . He nodded at the silver display in the wall case . " Do you sell the stuff ? " " The Peter Archer silver ? Are you a collector ? Do you know silver ? No ? Well , Peter Archer was a colonial silversmith whose shop was right here in Barnard 's Crossing . He 's practically unknown , except for collectors of course . Paul Revere is the name everybody knows . Now some of us think  --  I think  --  that Archer was a better craftsman and that Revere 's reputation is due to his connection with the Revolution , Paul Revere 's ride and all that sort of thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " well , I guess it was my idea . Anyway , we thought we ought to do something about it . I approached the people at the Boston Art Museum , and they agreed to a Peter Archer exhibit if I could come up with a decent representation of his work . Those pieces in the bank are on loan from people from all over the area . It 's all in the spirit of the Bicentennial . But , of course , we 're hard-headed Yankeesaround here , so I was able to get as much as we have , and it 's still coming in , by pointing out to the owners that having pieces exhibited at the Boston Art Museum will increase their value . " " Sounds like good business , Mr. Gore . Mrs. Segal is at the hotel . Maybe I ought to call her and tell her we 're coming over . " 29 " Sure . Use this phone . " Gore reached for the phone on the receptionist 's desk and slid it over . " Where did you say you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted the receiver . " The Agathon Yacht Club . " " A yacht club ? Sounds kind of grand . " " This is sailing country , Mr. Segal , and the yachts are small sailboats mostly . It 's the oldest club on the North Shore , though , and over the years it has developed into quite a place . Besides the regular docking facilities , we 've got tennis courts , the only grass courts around . Costs a fortune to maintain them , but I suppose it 's worth it  --  and a driving range , and a pistol range . But the nicest thing is the dining room . It 's right on the water . I mean it 's right over the water on pilings . You can actually hear the waves under you . It 's like eating on the deck of a boat . " " Sounds nice . Mrs. Segal will like it . " 6 " WHY IT 'S LIKE BEING ON THE WATER ! " MIMI EXCLAIMED AS SHEsat down at the table near the window that Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gore beamed . " Right now , since the tide is in , you are on the water . This room is cantilevered over the water , but only when the tide is high . " He laughed . " It would have to be about a hundred yards long to make it when the tide is out . " " And there are so many boats ! " Mimi observed . " Not half as many as there are during Race Week , " said Gore . " The harbor is really crowded then . It almost seems as though you could cross it on foot , jumping from deck to deck . " " Very nice , " said Segal . " All the members own boats ? They all interested in sailing ? " " Oh no . Some had them and gave them up . There 's a lot of work involved in owning a boat , and a big expense , too . Some never owned a boat , but crew occasionally for their friends . And then there are some who are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I used to be pretty keen . But nowadays the only facility I use is the pistol range . " He smiled shyly . " I 'm the club champion . " " Pistols , eh ? I do n't believe I 've ever fired one . " " Oh , it 's really a lot of fun . Would you like to try it  --  after lunch , I mean ? " " No , I think I 'll pass it up , " said Segal , smiling . The waiter approached and they ordered . There were not many dining , and they were served quickly  --  fish chowder , and then broiled mackerel . They ate slowly and Segal obviously enjoyed it . " They do you very good here , " he remarked . " This fish , and the chowder  --  excellent . " 31 " Delicious , " murmured Mimi . " Well , we 've got a good chef . And the fish was probably caught this morning . That 's the advantage of living on the coast . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to eat here ? " " And their guests , of course , " said Gore . " What 's involved in becoming a member ? " " The usual , " said Gore . " A member sponsors you . Your name is posted , and then the membership committee votes on you . You pay your fees and that 's it . " " Oh , Ben , would n't it be nice to come here for dinner whenever we wanted a seafood meal , " said Mimi . " Yeah . Suppose you put my name up for membership , " Segal suggested negligently . " I 'd be happy to , " said Gore . " But you know I could always fix you up with a guest card for a few days whenever you come down . " " Thanks , but we expect to be here more than just a few days every now and then . In fact , we 're thinking of settling here . " " You mean right here in Barnard 's Crossing ? I 'm glad to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful old town . " He hesitated . " Does that mean that you are planning on holding Rohr-bough ? " " That 's right . I 'm going to operate it personally . That 's confi-dential . " Gore smiled slyly . " Does that mean you want me to keep it a secret , or that you want me to leak it discreetly ? " Segal stared . Then he laughed shortly , a single explosive , Ha . " You 're all right , young man . As a matter of fact , it does n't mean a damn thing . It just came out  --  automatic , I suppose . We 've got a controlling interest in the company , and I think it has good possibilities . No reason for keeping it secret . " " And you 'll be living here ? Have you found a place yet ? " " I suppose we 'll build . As a matter of fact , Mimi and I have been doing some looking around . You know a good realtor ? " Because he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he thought Segal might appreciate his showing preference for a Jew , he said , " Henry Maltzman whose place is just down the street from the bank is a good man . He knows all the property in the area that 's available . " " But we 've already found a piece of land , " said Mrs. Segal . Segal showed momentary annoyance . " That 's right , " he said , 32 " but I do n't mind paying a commission . A good agent is worth it . " " You 're absolutely right , " said Gore . " There are a lot of local ordinances , and in an old town like this , there are tricky rights-ofwaythat you want to know about before you buy . A local agent can save you a lot of grief . " " Oh , I always make it a point to deal with local people . " The waiter brought their coffee and Segal lit a cigar . " I 'm glad to hear you say that , " said Gore , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . Rohrbough started with us , and we did all their banking until they went public and got too big for us and had to go into Boston . But they continued to maintain their connection by having us do their payroll . I do n't mind admitting that I 'd hate to lose it . It 's a great convenience to the people working at Rohrbough , and we like to be of service to our friends and neighbors . " Segal cocked a quizzical eye at the younger man . " You get something out of it besides the chance to be of service to your friends and neighbors , do n't you ? " Gore laughed self-consciously . " Well , of course , there 's our fee for the bookkeeping , and it means extra people , a lot of extra people , coming into the bank . It gives us a crack at them for ChristmasClub and personal loans and auto loans and occasionally a mortgage . " Segal smiled . " Not to mention the float on maybe a quarter to a half million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention it . But it rarely goes up that high , especially these days . And while some deposit their checks in their own banks , so there 's the delay of having it go through the Boston clearinghouse , and others maybe cash them at the supermarket , where it also has to go through Boston , an awful lot cash their checks directly with us the same day they get them . " " All right , " said Segal . " I 'll think about it . You wo n't forget about that membership , will you ? " " I 'll take care of that right away . " " WHY SHOULD YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MINYAN ? " ASKEDRabbi Small petulantly . He peered nearsightedly from one to the other of the three women seated in front of his desk in his study . " You 're exempt from the commandment to recite the morning prayers . Why should you want to assume an unnecessary burden ? " " Like we used to be exempt from the burden of voting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or the burden of holding property ? " She had an air of assurance , and it was obvious that she had no intention of being led by Mrs. Froelich , who as president of the Sisterhood was the head of the delegation . She was smartly dressed in a charcoal gray pantsuit . On her lapel she sported her large plastic Women 's Lib pin . Rabbi Small was taken aback both by the question and by the tone in which it was asked . It was not merely sarcastic ; it was also hostile . He shook his head slowly . " No , Mrs. Mandell . It 's not like that , not like that at all , " he said earnestly . " Look here , you know what a sin is . Well , what 's the opposite ? What 's the antonym of sin ? " " Virtue ? " Mrs. Froelich offered . " A good deed , " suggested Mrs. Allen . The rabbi nodded . " It 's both of those things in English , but in Hebrew we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it means a commandment . When we perform what has been commanded us , we have done a mitzvah . The important thing to keep in mind is that a commandment carries with it the implication of something that you would not ordinarily do of your own accord . We do it because it is commanded . The reason for some of the commandments are obvious . The commandment to observe the Sabbath as a day of rest is something that we can readily understand , a day of rest once a week  --  that makes sense. 34You might do it without a commandment . But you might not be so willing to extend the privilege to your servants . Hence , the commandment . The commandment that proscribes the mingling of linen and wool in garments , shatnes , is harder to understand , but devout Jews do it even though they ca n't see the reason for it . Because it is commanded . " He paused to look at each of them in turn and then went on . " The important thing to remember is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get no extra points for doing what is not commanded . We are commanded to recite prayers three times a day , and there is no extra virtue in reciting them six times a day . In Christianity there is . The priest may prescribe the recital of a dozen Hail Marys as a penance . They have religious communities of monks and nuns who have vowed to pray all day long . While a pious Christian may spend a good deal of his time in prayer , it is not so in our religion . In study , yes , but not in prayer . Keep that in mind . It 's important . If you recite the blessing on wine or bread , and then do n't drink wine or taste a morsel of bread , it is not a mitzvah , but the reverse . The classic example is that of the person who , while away from home , hears fire engines and prays that it is not his house that is burning . Such a prayer is considered sinful for two reasons : because it implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is burning ; or because you are praying for an impossibility , that something that has already happened will not happen . Do you understand ? " He peered at them eagerly through his thick-lensed glasses . " You mean , " began Mrs. Froelich uncertainly as she tried to frame her thought , " that  --  I can understand the first reason , but  --  " " Let me try to make it a little clearer , " said the rabbi . " I have a relative , my cousin Simcha . Simcha the Apicorus , we call him in the family . An Apicorus is an agnostic , from Epicurus , the Greek philosopher , and a mistaken notion of his doctrine . Although Simchais actually a pious and observant Jew , he has some queer notionsabout some of the commandments . For example , he does not consider chicken as meat in the context of the dietary laws . He arguesthat since the reason we do not mix meat and dairy foods is in elaborate adherence to the commandment , Thou shalt not seethe the flesh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not apply to chicken , since chickens do n't give milk . " " Say , that 's cool , " Mrs. Allen exclaimed . The rabbi smiled . " He also refused to affix a mezuzah to his doorframe on the grounds that the commandment is To write35them on the doorposts of your house , ' and he argued that it was n't his house , that he was only renting . Now , I grant you that that 's a pilpul , a matter of splitting hairs , and pretty extreme at that , but it gives the general idea that a commandment is an obligation , not necessarily welcome , that one carries out because it is commanded . In the same vein , a famous rabbi said that one should not say of the foods forbidden by our dietary laws  --  pork , shellfish , and the others  --  that we will not eat them because they are unpleasant and unpalatable , but rather that they are tasty and even delectable , but we will not eat them because there is a commandmentforbidding it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt from the positive commandments that have to be done at a particular time , so they are exempt from attending the minyan for the morning and evening prayers . " " But why are they exempt from those commandments , Rabbi ? " asked Mrs. Froelich . " Because observing them would interfere with their more importantwork of managing the home and the family . " " Naturally , " said Molly Mandell sarcastically , " the idea is to get as much work out of them as possible . " " No . " The rabbi shook his head . " No , Mrs. Mandell . It 's becausewith us , the synagogue , or as we call it , the temple , is not the center of our religion . With us , it 's the home . It is there that the Sabbath is celebrated , there that the Feast of Passover , the most important liturgical ceremony in our religion , is held , there that the Succah is built . On the practical side , Mrs. Mandell , I can imagine a case in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead parent , might insist on his wife accompanying him to the minyan to insure that there are the necessary ten , even if it means neglecting to prepare breakfast for the children . " Mrs. Froelich nodded vigorously . " When his father died , Harveywent to say Kaddish every single day , morning and evening , for a year . Before that he never went to the daily minyan , and he has n't gone since . But he certainly was Old Faithful that year . And you know , he was n't even close to his father . They never reallygot along . " " Sure , he had guilt feelings , " Mrs. Allen offered . " To hear you tell it , Rabbi , " Molly Mandell said , " the whole Jewish religion is practically dedicated to making things easier for women . It sounds nice , but it 's a crock , and I can prove it . Becausein those daily prayers you say every morning , you start by thanking God for having been born a man . " 36The others were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his reaction . He had colored but he managed a smile . " I do n't see how you can object to that particular blessing , since it is in such complete agreement with the thinking of your movement . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , your Women 's Lib movement maintains that life is easierfor the man than it is for the woman , does n't it ? " he asked . " Well sure , but  --  " " So why should n't men thank God for it ? And is it wrong for them to try to equalize the differences a little by according women special privileges ? " 8LAURA MALTZMAN WAS NOT A PRETTY WOMAN ; IN FACT , SHE WASplain . She was tall and angular with square shoulders . She had a long face with a square chin , which seemed a little off center , as though she had just been struck a blow , or was on the point of turning her head . But her eyes were large and kindly and understanding . As her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room from the hallway , where he had been on the phone , she looked up inquiringly . " Just got word , " he said , " that the loan is going through , pretty sure anyway . " " Oh ? Who called ? " " Molly Mandell . She spoke to Gore about it , and she thinks he 'll go along . She thought I 'd like to know . " He strode up and down the room and then stopped in front of her . " Look , this dinneryou 're having , how about calling the Mandells and inviting them ? " " But they 're so much younger than the others , " she objected . " So what ? I want her  --  them  --  to know that I 'm appreciative  --  " " You appointed Herb Mandell to the board last week . " " Yeah , but he 's active in the Brotherhood , so she might think it was for that . I want her to know I 'm appreciative . See ? She 's got a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , like this phone call tonight . That can be pretty important , having someone you can count on right there in the bank . So I want her to know  --  " Laura dropped her eyes to the knitting in her lap . " You think she 's pretty ? " she asked . Instantly he was wary . " Well now , she 's no cover girl , but yeah , I think she 's kind of cute . She 's eager and alive and fresh  --  " " I guess she 's fresh all right . Lillian Allen was telling me that38she was with the group that went to see the rabbi , and she was pretty fresh to him . " " Oh , Lillian Allen ! What did she say ? " " She said that Molly said the whole Jewish religion was sexist and she practically called the rabbi a male chauvinist pig . " " Did she ? " He chuckled . " Well now , that 's not what I would 've called him . I figure him for more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't become a rabbi and spend his life praying . I know these guys . You 'd think butter would n't melt in their mouths , but in their own quiet way , they screw up the works . So do n't expect me to get uptight because Molly Mandell told him off . I intend to do a little of it myself if he gets in the way . The temple belongs to the members , and I and the board of directors are the people they elected to run it for them . The rabbi is just somebody we hire to do a job , and the sooner he realizes it , the better . Now , will you call up Molly Mandell and invite her ? " " If you insist . " His face got red and his eyes protruded . " Yes , Goddammit , I insist . " 9ELLSWORTH JORDON PACED THE LIVING ROOM OF HIS OLD VICtorianhouse , glowering at the clock on the mantelpiece each time he passed it . Billy was late getting home from work , and he was worried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he caught sight of him hurrying up the long driveway , his annoyancewith himself had turned into anger at the young man . " Where have you been ? " he demanded . " You 're late . " Billy was contrite . " Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . I missed the bus and I decided to walk instead of waiting for the next one . It was so nice out . " " Do n't you know Martha has an engagement for tonight and has to leave early ? She mentioned it this morning . " " Gee , I forgot . " " And I am due at the Agathon . " " Gee , I 'm sorry . But Martha can leave the dishes and I 'll do them . " " Well , we 'll see . Wash up now and let 's not keep Martha waitingany longer . " They ate in silence . Normally , Billy would have prattled about his day at the bank , but having been reprimanded , he was reluctant to speak . Jordon occasionally shot furtive glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reproved him for coming home late , which was his right and duty . But when he had told him to go and wash up , Billy should have realized that in effect his explanation and apology had been accepted . So why did n't he speak ? Did he expect him , so much his senior , to make the over-ture ? Though he continued to glower over his plate , after a while , Jordon reflected philosophically that young people naturally lacked subtlety , that in the few months that Billy had been with40him , he had adjusted quite well , that in the evenings and on weekendswhen they were together , the boy had even proved companionable , albeit in the gauche , awkward way to be expected in the young . To be sure , the boy was graceless and uncertain , but he presumed all young people of that age were . He did n't look you in the eye , and he slouched and was slovenly in his dress . His glasses kept sliding forward on his nose , and one of the bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , he was obedient , even docile , and thank God , his face was not pimpled . And , a positive plus  --  he seemed to enjoy his work at the bank , where he worked as a teller . Gore had even reported that the customers seemed to like him . It had been no problem getting him the job . " I 've got a young fellow coming to stay with me for a while , Larry . I 've known his family for a long time . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd give him a job in the bank while he 's here . " " How long is he going to stay ? " " Months . Maybe a year . Maybe longer . For some time I 've thought I ought to have someone sleeping in . " Lawrence Gore smiled knowingly and nodded . Jordon frowned . He had a reputation as a pinchpenny , and he knew what Gore was thinking  --  that rather than hire a companion , he was having Billy come for just the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . " And I 'd consider it a personal favor , Larry , " he went on , " for any kindness you can show him . I do n't mean for you to grant him any special privileges that the other employees do n't have , but you know , a friendly word of encouragementnow and then . I guess he 's something of a mama 's boy and does n't have the confidence  --  " " Sure , I understand , Ellsworth . Tell you what . I 'm starting a class of pistol shooting . He can join and I 'll teach him how to shoot . " " Goddammit , Larry , this is n't the Wild West . Use some commonsense . Learning to shoot a pistol is n't going to help make a man of him  --  " " That 's where you 're wrong , " said Gore earnestly . " I was the runt in my class in high school . Most of the girls were taller than me . Once at a party they rigged it so I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My eyes were just about level with her breasts . God , it was embarrassing . " The older man grinned lewdly . " Your face right up against her tits , eh ? That might not have been so bad . " 41Gore grinned back . " Yeah , nowadays it would n't bother me , but it sure did then . " He shook his head in reminiscent reflection . " It was n't just with girls , you understand . Being short makes some men assertive , but most people become shy and cautious and withdrawn . Well , in college you had to go out for some sport , and I chose the pistol team , figuring it was something where my being short would n't matter . And you know , as I learned to handle the weapon , I began to grow . " The older man looked down at him and said , " Not noticeably . " " Yes , noticeably . I did n't get taller , but feeling comfortable with a handgun gave me confidence in everything . It gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of yourself . When I won the intercollegiate Regional Championship , I was a giant . You leave the boy to me , Ellsworth . I 'll make a man out of him . " Not until Martha came in to serve the main course did Jordon break the silence , and then it was to address her . " Big date tonight , Martha ? Somebody special ? " he asked jocosely . " No , just a date , " she said . " Anybody I know ? " " I do n't guess so . It 's a feller from Lynn I met the other night when I went bowling . " " Well , do n't worry . You 'll get out in good time . Just leave the dishes and Billy will do them . " There , he thought , I 've called him by name . That should let him know that I 'm not angry any longer . But the young man did not take the hint and kept his eyes on his plate and remained silent . When Martha came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . " I 'll be going now , " she said . " I 've stacked the dishes , and the soap powder and towels are on the drainboard . " " Okay , Martha , have a good time . " Moodily Jordon sipped his coffee , his eyes abstracted . When he finished , he left the table without a word and went into the living room . Presently Billy joined him there , and Jordon looked up from his paper and asked , " Dishes all done ? " " Yes , sir . " " And put away ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , that 's good . That 's fine . You written to your mother yet ? " " I thought I 'd do that tomorrow . " Jordon 's face darkened . " I promised your mother that she 'd get42a letter from you every week . I want you to do that right now . " " But I told Mr. Gore I 'd be over to help him with the photos of the silver collection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your mother comes first . You go to your room right now and do that letter . " " Oh fish ! " Billy muttered , but he went to his room and closed the door behind him . Jordon followed him to the door . " And I 'm locking you in till you finish , " he called after him and turned the key in the lock . Through the door he called , " And you 'll stay in there until you 've written that letter . I 'm going to have my regular meditation now , so I 'll thank you not to disturb me for the next twenty minutes . After that you can knock if you 've finished and I 'll let you out . But I 'm telling you that if it 's not done by then , I 'm going to the club and you 'll wait in there until I get back . " He listened for a moment , his ear to the door , but Billy did not reply . He sat down on his recliner for the Transcendental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty minutes he allowed himself were up , he got out of his chair and tiptoed over to the door of the boy 's room . He listened , his ear pressed to the door , but he heard nothing . So be it , he thought . If this is going to be a test of willpower , we 'll see who 's the stronger . He went to the front door , opened it and then banged it behind him . Then opened it carefully once again and listened . Hearing no response , he eased the door closed silently and got into his car parked in the driveway. 10THE CALL CAME LATE IN THE AFTERNOON . " MR . MALTZMAN ? BEN Segal speaking . I 'm interested in buying some land . Mr. Gore at the bank suggested I call you . I wonder if we could meet with you " Ben Segal ? Did he know a Ben Segal ? Then it came to him . It must be the Ben Segal of Chicago . There were rumors that he was in town . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Segal ? " he asked calmly . " I 'm calling from your local hotel , the Arlington Arms . We 're staying here . " For a moment he debated whether to appear busy and then decidedagainst it . " If you 're free now , " he said , " I can come right over . " They sat in the gaudy , overfurnished sitting room of the only suite that the Arlington Arms afforded and which was intended primarily for business conferences . The Segals sat on a heavily brocaded sofa , Maltzman on the edge of a leather lounge chair , uneasily balancing a coffee cup and the petit fours that Mrs. Segal had rung for when he arrived . " I 'm interested in buying a piece of land , " Segal explained . He fished in his coat pocket and found the match cover on which he had scribbled the name of the street . " It 's out on the Point , I think you call it , on Crossland Avenue , just beyond Porter Street . " " Yeah , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all residentialland out there and our zoning laws are pretty strict . " " Of course . I understand . " He smiled . " I was n't planning on building a factory there , or a warehouse . " " I mean it has to be a single family residence . You ca n't just have a house that 's used mostly for executive meetings and din-44ners and maybe as a place to put up visiting firemen . It has to be used by a family as a regular residence . See what I mean ? " " Oh yes , I understand , " said Segal . " This is going to be just an ordinary house  --  " " We 're planning to live in it ourselves , Mr. Maltzman , " Mrs. Segal explained . " We 're planning to settle here . " " That 's right , " her husband added . " I 'm going to operate RohrboughCorporation personally . " Mimi leaned forward eagerly . " You see , Mr. Maltzman , we 've lived in cities all our lives , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a large apartment in Chicago , to be sure , but it 's still in a hotel . And we 're fed up with the city . With the noise and the dirt and the crime  --  being afraid to go out for a walk in the evening . So we 're planning to settle here . It means changing our whole lifestyle , becoming part of a community . That 's what we want . It 's that , I expect , as much as anything that decided Ben on operating Rohrbough personally . " " That 's right , " said her husband . " At lunch today , Gore was telling us about your town meeting that everybody goes to . Well , we 'd like to go to that . And to the Fourth of July bonfire , and to the arts festival you hold in the town hall . " Maltzman nodded slowly . An idea was beginning to take shape in his mind . He directed his eyes to Ben Segal . " Are you still Jewish ? I mean , you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't practice it , but I 've never denied it . " Mimi said , " His brother changed his name to Sears and wanted Ben to , but Ben would n't consider it . " " That 's fine , " said Maltzman , " but in a small town like Barnard'sCrossing , people want to know where you stand . If you want to be respected and accepted , you got to be part of the group they associate you with . And here , that means joining the temple . You got to show that you 're willing to stand up and be counted . " " But I 'm not the least bit religious , " Segal protested . " So what ? Most of our members are n't . We only get about a hundred at a Friday evening service . I always go because I 'm president of the congregation . Joining the temple is not a matter of religion , so much as a way of showing you feel you belong . " " But it 's different with me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to be a member of a synagogue . You see , I was never Bar Mitzvah . My folks were terribly poor when I was a kid , and they just could n't afford it at the time . " " Oh Ben , dear , you never told me . " Mimi was all sympathy. 45 " But about Bar Mitzvah , I imagine you can have'it anytime . Ca n't he , Mr. Maltzman ? Seems to me I saw something on TV about a seventy-year-old man in California who just had one . His folks could n't afford it either when he was a youngster . " " Say , I remember that , " said Maltzman . " And in the Hadassah Journal there was a story about a whole bunch of men , a club , or from the same synagogue , mature men , who went to Israel and had a group Bar Mitzvah at the Wall . Look here , Mr. Segal , if you 're interested , I 'll see the rabbi and arrange it . " Then it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put it up to the board , and if they see things my way , we 'll have the temple sponsor it . " " Well , it seems to me there 's quite a ceremony , is n't there ? I mean , it 's not just the party . I seem to remember kids my age who had to study up for it . Special prayers they had to learn by heart and  --  " " Nothing to it , Mr. Segal , " said Maltzman earnestly . " You 're called up to the Reading of the Torah and you pronounce a blessing . The Bar Mitzvah kids chant it in Hebrew . But you do n't have to chant it . Or if you were willing , I could arrange for the cantor to teach you . And even if you do n't know how to read Hebrew , we have it transliterated in English . Or you could even say it in English . Then after the portion is read , you say another blessing , and we could work that the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bar Mitzvah boy chants the portion from the Prophets , too . Hell , some of them run the whole Reading service . Kind of showing off , you see . But it 's not necessary . Believe me , the whole thing 's a pipe . " " Is yours the only synagogue in town , Mr. Maltzman ? " asked Mimi . " That 's right , Mrs. Segal , and all Jews in the community belong , all that have been living here for some time . Of course , there are some families that are new , and maybe not a hundred percent sure they 're going to remain on account of their jobs , but those who 've settled here , practically all of them belong . You say the word , and I 'll make arrangements with the rabbi and all . " Ben Segal looked doubtfully at his wife , and when she nodded brightly , he said , " All right . Count me in . " " Swell , " said Maltzman . " And I 'll get to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DINING ROOM OF THE AGATHON YACHT CLUB , ONE COULD order a cocktail , but only with dinner . And while you could linger over coffee and a brandy afterward , the house committee did not like you to linger too long . During the sailing season , the dining room was busy and there were apt to be people waiting for a table . In the off-season , the waiters resented having to wait overlong to clean up . There was the lounge , of course , but it was on the formal side  --  a room of long windows curtained and velvet draped , of rugs and carpets , of sofas and armchairs in satin and brocade , of highly polished mahogany tables , with silk-shaded lamps . It was where you met your guests and chatted for a few minutes , just long enough for them to be impressed , before ushering them into the dining room , or down to the dock to your boat . Mostly women sat there and had tea or coffee brought to them . For serious drinking , or for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , and it was masculine ter- ritory . It was not forbidden to women , but by tacit agreement they never went there . It was a bare room with glaring ceiling lights that cast pools of light on the bare gray battleship linoleum that covered the floor . The furniture consisted of half a dozen round cigarette-scarred wooden tables , each surrounded by several cap- tain 's chairs . Against the wall was a small bar , little more than a high counter , behind which were shelves of bottles , a small refrig- erator and a sink . The decor , or lack of it , was a holdover from Prohibition days . The feeling then had been that while it was not necessary that drinking be surreptitious , it would be brazen to do it in luxurious comfort . With repeal , and periodically since , there were sugges- tions that the room should be refurnished , something on the order47of leather armchairs and knotty pine paneling and sporting or sailing prints , but the members who used it most resisted stoutly , perhaps through fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be attracted to it . There were no waiters , only the barman . If it was not busy , he might in response to a nod bring over a refill , but usually you got your drink at the bar and carried it over to a table . Thursday was usually an off night at the bar , which is why Jordon chose it for his weekly visit . He did not like crowded bars , full of the boisterousdin of well-lubricated good fellowship . He preferred the companyof his old cronies , people he was used to , with whom he could talk sensibly , even seriously and philosophically , or sit with them in pleasant silence if the mood so moved them . Although others would probably drift in later , only one table was now occupied , and as he waited for his drink to be poured , Jordon noted with satisfaction that of the four men seated around it , two were Thursday night regulars . There was old Dr. Springhurst , the retired rector of St. Andrew 's Episcopal , silverhairedand distinguished-looking in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atheist , Jordon got a special pleasure in arguing religion with him . The other was Albert Megrim , a stockbrokerand one of the selectmen of the town , with whom he liked to talk politics . Megrim was a stoutish man , with a round face surmountedby thin hair precisely parted in the middle . He always wore a dark conservative business suit and a white shirt with a bow tie , even on hot summer nights . The other two at the table , Jordon knew only casually . Jason Walters , a corporation lawyer , was a tall , craggy man , who went in for vigorous sports and made a fetish of keeping fit . Jordon noted that he was wearing a sweat suit and sneakers and was probably going to top off the evening with a fast game of squash . The fourth man , by far the youngest of the group , not yet forty , was Don Burkhardt , a partner in a firm called Creative Engineers Incorporated , which went in for such diverse things as designing office furniture and layout , work-flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corporations . Him , Jordon eyed with distaste as he waited at the bar for his drink to be poured . He did not like his carefully tailored Eisenhower jacket and jeans of carefully faded blue . He did not like his blond Afro hairstyle , a halo of curls framing his narrow face . And most of all , he did not like what he regarded as his radical ideas , by which he48meant that Burkhardt made no secret of voting Democrat , and considered himself a liberal Democrat at that . As they saw Jordon approach carrying his drink , the four men shifted a little to make room for him to insinuate another chair . " How are you keeping , Ellsworth ? " Dr. Springhurst greeted him . " Tolerable , Padre , tolerable . " " Gore is down at the pistol range , I suppose , " remarked Albert Megrim . " No , I came myself this time , " said Jordon . " Larry is busy preparing for his Peter Archer silver exhibition . Why ? " " We were wondering about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has he got a boat ? " " Whatsat ? New member ? I 'm on the committee and I do n't know anything about any new member . " " His name has been posted , Ellsworth , " said Jason Walters . " Name of Segal . " " It 's Ben Segal of Chicago , " said Megrim , " the one who 's takingover the Rohrbough Corporation . " " Segal ? Jew ? " demanded Jordon . Megrim smiled sardonically . " You ca n't always tell these days . He 's not what I 'd call a Jew , Ellsworth . I mean , he 's a financier . There was a long write-up on him in Business Week . A man like that is not a Jew . " " I know exactly what you mean , " said Walters . " There 's a privatebank in New York that our firm has had dealings with for years , trust funds and what not . Well , one day I had occasion to call their president , and I was told he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of their trust division , and he was n't in . So , kind of jokingly , I asked what was going on , was it some kind of holiday in New York ? And the switchboard operator tells me it was Yon  --  Yom  --  " " Yom Kippur , " Don Burkhardt supplied . " That 's right , Yom Kippur . It 's their very special holy day . " He turned to the younger man . " How did you know ? " " Because my partner is a Jew , and a lot of my friends are . " " Oh ! Well , anyway , the point I was trying to make is that all the years I had been dealing with them , it never struck me that they were Jewish . The whole firm is . At least all the top brass . What do you think of that ? " He shook his head in wonder . " You guys make me sick , " said Burkhardt , pushing away from49the table as if to give physical demonstration of his disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-necks . " " You mean me ? " Jason Walters was indignant . " Do n't you try to make me out a bigot . I 'll have you know our family physician is Dr. Goldstein here in town and we think the world of him . " " If you mean me , Don , " Megrim drawled , " it 's hogwash . My last year in college , I roomed with a Jew . He lives out in Detroit now , and whenever I get there on business , he 's the first one I call . We go to dinner and then maybe a show and afterward we might go to a bar and just talk . Why , there are things I tell him that I would n't tell my own brother , or my wife , either , for that matter . He 's probably closer to me than  --  " " And I might point out , " Jason Walters went on loftily , " that a couple of years ago , instead of going to Bermuda or Palm Beach for our winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the Holy Land , and I told everybody what a terrific job they were doing . Of course , they 've got to do something about the Palestinian refugees , but on balance they 've done wonders , and I said so every chance I got . " " You 've got to understand , Don , " said Albert Megrim soothingly , " that this is a social club . It 's a place where you come to meet people . Naturally , you prefer your own kind because you 're more comfortable with them . " " That 's right , " said Walters earnestly . " Look , my daughters go to the dances here . Well , naturally , I want them to meet their own kind of people . That does n't mean I 'm prejudiced . " " Sure , " said Burkhardt scornfully , " everybody denies being anti-Semitic , but  --  " " I do n't , " said Ellsworth Jordon . " You do n't ? " The young man stared at him . " You mean you are anti-Semitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you are , too , Burkhardt . You 're ashamed to admit it because you have a lot of crackpot liberal ideas about how only the ignorant are prejudiced . But you are just the same . Having one as a business partner , or as a family physicianwhom you think the world of , or as a best friend proves nothing . Or , rather , to a Jew it proves you are anti-Semitic . That 's a kind of inside joke among them . Anytime anyone says his best friends are Jews , they know it 's an anti-Semite talking . " He smiled broadly . " I know , because at one time some of my best friends were Jewish . " " But you just said  --  " Don Burkhardt was nonplussed. 50 " Oh , I can admit it because I know why we 're anti-Semitic . " " You do ? Why ? " " Because they make us feel uncomfortable . " " Why should they make you feel uncomfortable ? " " Because they 're better than we are , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How do you mean , better ? " demanded Megrim . " Morally , ethically , " said Jordon . " I guess they 're just more civilized than we are . That 's what makes us feel uncomfortable , and that 's why we dislike them . " He laughed aloud . " And the joke is that the buggers do n't have any idea why they 're disliked , not a clue . They just do n't understand the psychology of it . They point out that they 're good and loyal citizens with a low divorce rate and a low crime rate , that they 're sober and industrious and ambitious . They 're active in all kinds of worthwhile movements and reforms and are usually on the side of the underdog . But that does n't get you liked , you know . Quite the contrary . They were the first to help the Blacks , for instance , and the result is that they are the ones the Blacks resent most . " " Yeah , but they helped the Blacks because they 're both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in Israel , where they are in the majority  --  " " They 're making the same mistake , " said Jordon promptly . " They set up a two-bit country on a two by four piece of land , and the first thing they do is to take in all their kinfolk from all the Arab countries , the old and the sick , and not a dime among the lot of them . And they feed them when they themselves have n't got a pot to pee in . And there were almost as many of these refugeesas the total population of the country at the time . " Jordon took a sip of his drink and continued , " On the other hand , the entire Arab world , about eighty million of them with Lord knows how many millions of square miles of territory , could not find room for a couple of thousand of their own kinfolk and left them in refugee camps to rot . And everybody like Jason Walters here says the Israelis have got to do something about their Palestinian refugees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , they take care of their own , " said Megrim . " Everybody knows that . But today  --  " " Today they have the Good Fence over at the Lebanon border , " said Burkhardt . " And those are n't their own they 're giving free medical treatment . Any Arab who comes to the fence , Christianor Moslem , who needs help , gets it . " 51 " Yeah , how about that , Padre ? " Jordon jeered . " Those are Christians that are being slaughtered , and nobody in the Christian world lifts a finger or even protests , not the Pope , not your World Council of Churches , not the Christian countries . Only the damn Jews . It 's downright embarrassing . No wonder that no one supportsthem in the UN . That 's the point I was making . They make everybody uncomfortable , so everybody votes against them . " " The United States does n't do much better there , " Jason Walters pointed out . " And if you come right down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordon chortled . " Sure they do , and it 's for the same reason . We 're a little that way , ourselves . " " Hogwash ! They hate us because we 're rich and powerful , " said Megrim . " No , that 's not it , " Jordon asserted . " When you 're powerful , you 're feared . Sure you may be hated , but only as long as there 's reason for being afraid of you . In World War II we hated the Japs and the Germans because we were afraid of them . We did n't hate the Italians because we were n't . And as soon as the war was over , we also stopped hating the Japs and the Germans . You want to know why America is hated today ? Why all this Yankee , Go Home ' propaganda ? It 's because we were guilty of perpetrating a terrible act of charity , the Marshall Plan . Never before in the historyof the world had a conquering country set out to rebuild the countries it had defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we 've been hated for it ever since . And they 'll go on hating us until the memory of that tremendous moral act is dimmed or forgotten . " " That 's pure hogwash , Ellsworth , " Megrim drawled . " The reasonthey dislike us is because we 're brash and pushy when we 're in their countries . Maybe it 's because we 're away from home , or because we do n't know their language or their customs , so we feel a little uncertain and we cover up by being , well , assertive . And that 's why we tend to dislike Jews  --  because they 're pushy . " " I would n't say they were pushy , " said Burkhardt . Now that the conversation was on a philosophical level , he could speak calmly . " I think they 're a little more intense than we are . That 's all . My partner , for instance , when he gets involved in a project , it 's as though the whole world depended on it . The same when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the course . It 's as though everything he does is a little bit more , as though he 's operatingon a higher body temperature , if you see what I mean . And52I 've noticed it in others , too . It may be something in their genes . Stands to reason , with all the trouble they 've been through , pogromsand what not , those living today must be the result of a special selection process . " " Not at all . It 's their religion , " Jordon declared flatly . " They do n't have any religion , " said Dr. Springhurst , his intereststirred for the first time . " Cummon , Padre , they invented it , the modem kind , I mean , " said Jordon . " They did . And for a while , they were a religious people . The Lord was close to them in those days and proved Himself with miracles . " The old man shook his head lugubriously . But the more He proved Himself , the more they moved away from Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Sea , they constructedthe golden calf . Nevertheless they remained a religious people . It was during the life of our Lord Jesus that the great change came . He saw it and tried to prevent it . That was His mission , to prevent the Scribes and the Pharisees from turning the true religion into a kind of practical ethical culture society . They do n't have a God , not one they can look to for salvation . Their God ca n't be known , by definition , if you please . He ca n't be seen . He ca n't even be imagined . He 's like X in algebra . It enables them to justify any regulation or code of rules they wanted to set up : Do it because it is commanded by the Lord . ' They do n't demand faith . They have no hope of heaven , no fear of hell , merely a code of behavior justified only with Thus saith the Lord . ' See , that way they do n't have to prove anything . They do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intelligent or practical . There 's no argument about a different way or a better way by the opposition . Merely , this is the law because God says so . Sure , they passed some good laws , as any governing body would be likely to do , and some damn silly ones , too . But that 's not religion any more than the American Constitution is religion , or the Code Napoleon . That 's what our Lord Jesus fought against . This was n't the usual backsliding that Moses had to contend with when they turned away from the God of Israel to other gods . But this was turning away from the basic concept of religion , the relation of a man to God . That 's why they are disliked , Ellsworth . Because they are the one godless people . " " That puts them right in your church , Ellsworth , " said Megrim , grinning . " They 're a bunch of atheists according to the good doctor . " 53 " Nah . " With a wide sweep of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've missed it , Padre . We do n't object to them because they 're godless . I certainly would n't on that account . Maybe they did give up their religion for an ethical culture society . But not content with that , they then palmed Jesus on the rest of us . Remember , He 's one of theirs . They foisted Him on us , and they slid out from under . They gave us a religion that nobody can follow  --  turn the other cheek and all that sort of thing , while they developed a system , a set of rules , if you like , that people can live with . That 's what we resent , that they eased us into a religion that makes us feel guilty all the time . " " But you do n't follow it , " Megrim insisted . " You say you 're an atheist , so I ca n't see how you 're affected . " " Sure , I 'm affected , " said Jordon . " I grew up in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , you ca n't ever get rid of it . It 's what enables them to do so well at  --  oh , all sorts of things . Their minds are clear . They 're not guilt-ridden . They 're not weighted down with superstitions . Their mathematicians or doctors or physicists , nothing they believe conflicts with their science . They do n't have to keep a portion of their minds in a watertightcompartment , the way we do . So they have a tremendous advantageover us . They function more efficiently , so it seems as if they are operating at a higher temperature . " The Christianity they gave us consists of concepts that no one but a saint could possibly follow  --  and I 've often wondered what their dreams were like . All this business of Turn the other cheek , ' and If thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , ' and Love thine enemy , ' it 's beyond the capacity of a normal human being . " On the other hand , the Jews set up a religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a normal person can follow , like helping each other out , and respecting each other , and enjoying life by eating and drinking and having families . And what 's the result ? We do n't follow our rules because they 're beyond our capacity , and we keep only the irrational and the superstitious elements  --  the fear of going to hell , the guilt feelings we have when our minds perform their normal function of questioning the impossible . Whereas the Jews stick to their principles because they 're well within human limitations . And sometimes they even manage to follow the Christian rules  --  when it 's convenient , or good business , or reasonable , like in this Good Fence . But that 's loving your enemy and turning the other cheek . " 54A thought occurred to him . " Hey , you guys want to know something ? Theirs is the only Christian nation in the world today . How about that , Padre ? Here your church has been trying for centuries to convert them , and in the meantime they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , now that you 've proved that Jews are Christians , do you feel different about Segal 's membership ? " asked Megrim , grinning . " Hell no , " said Jordon . " I 'm still going to blackball the sonofa-bitch . " " I  --  I do n't understand , " said Burkhardt . " What do n't you understand ? " asked Jordon . " On the one hand you claim that Segal is a better man than you are , and on the other hand , you say you 're going to blackball him . " " So what ? Suppose you 're gaga over some woman , and you know she 's mean and petty and downright nasty . Does that mean that you 'll stop desiring her ? Desire , or dislike for that matter , or any of the emotions , they have a logic of their own . " He leered at the younger man . " When you 're young , you tend to be careful what you think . Ideas come into your head , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you push them away . Either you try not to think of them , or you twist them around to where they 're respectable . You 're afraid they 'll annoy your family or your boss or an important customer or client . But when you get to my age , especiallywhere you do n't have a family or a boss or important customers , more particularly when you 've been brushed by the wings of the Angel of Death as I have , then you do n't have to worry about strange ideas that come into your head . You can face them and even think them through , and then go on and do as you damn please . " " And it does n't bother you if you 're inconsistent ? " urged Burkhardt . Jordon smiled broadly . " Not one damn little bit . So I can say that the Jew is a better man than I am , and I still do n't want him around . " " You know , Ellsworth , " Megrim mused , looking up at the ceiling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife saw him yesterday at the bank and was saying she thought he looked Jewish . " Jordon stared blankly . " Oh , my God , I forgot all about Billy . Look , I 've got to run along . " And rising hastily he left the room. 55Although he believed in discipline , Jordon was no martinet . And in handling Billy , Jordon had been careful never to be too severe . After all , the boy was not really under his jurisdiction . He was free to go and might well leave if things got unpleasant . Besides , he wanted Billy to like him . If he had thought that the boy was going to be so stubborn , he would not have locked him in his room in the first place . He had expected that Billy would certainly submit before it was time for him to go to the Agathon . When he did not , of course he had to carry out his threat , but he had intended to stay at the club only long enough for a drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not intended to get involved in a long discussion , certainly not one that had lasted as long as this one had . He shut the front door with a bang and waited for the boy to call out and ask to be released . There was no response . A little worried now , he went to the door of the boy 's room and knocked . Then , his ear to the door , he listened intently . Still hearing nothing , he turned the key and flung open the door . The room was empty ! It was clear what had happened , the boy had climbed out of the window , no great feat since the room was just above ground level . The window was ajar an inch , obviously so that he could raise it easily and climb back in on his return . Nevertheless , he looked in the closet and was relieved to find that Billy 's clothes were still there . Jordon began to chuckle . Then he slapped his thigh and roared with laughter . He left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown spirit and he liked that . What 's more , he had got his own way , and without whining or arguing . And his way of doing it had meant that neither of them had lost face . He admitted that he was pleased at how it had worked out . A thought occurred to him , and he reached for the phone and called Lawrence Gore . " Is Billy there with you , Larry ? " he asked . " No , Ellsworth . He just left . Anything important ? I could yell to him from the window . " " No , and I 'd rather you did n't tell him I called . " He chuckled . " I 'll see you tomorrow at the bank and I 'll tell you about it . By the way , what time did he get there ? . . . About eight ? What do you know ? " The boy must have left within minutes after he had been locked in . He rubbed his hands together gleefully . Wonderful ! 12WITH HAT AND COAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snicked off the lights and prepared to leave . Then the phone rang . It was Laura , of course . She always managed to catch him before he left . " Henry ? Would you stop by the market on your way home ? I need a few things . " " Sorry , Laura . I 'm not coming straight home . I 've got to see the rabbi first . It 's important . " " Well , could n't you pick up these few things first and  --  " " Nothing doing . I 'll get stuck at the market , and then by the time I get to the rabbi 's , he 'll be getting ready to leave for the eveningservice . " " Then after you see the rabbi  --  " " The market will be closed . No , Laura , you 'll have to get them yourself or just manage without . " " But we 're having people over tonight . Have you forgotten ? " " No , I have n't forgotten . But I ca n't help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the rabbi 's living room , half an hour later , Maltzman talked of his great coup . " Do you realize what it will mean for the temple , having a man like Ben Segal as a member ? " " What will it mean ? " " More members , " Maltzman answered promptly . " Everybody likes to belong to an association  --  a club , a lodge , a temple , what have you  --  with a big shot . It 's human nature . If it 's a big , successfulbusiness tycoon like Ben Segal , maybe they figure his luck will rub off on them . Or maybe they hope to transact some business , or even get some advice on some stock they own . Mostly , it 's just so they can do a little name dropping . I was saying to Ben Segal  --  57you know , of the Rohrbough Corporation he 's a member in our temple  --  ' That kind of thing . " " Well , I can think of better reasons for joining a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the rabbi good-humoredly . Maltzman grinned . " Or we would n't have enough members for a minyan . " The rabbi grinned back . " All right , so did you sign him up ? " " Well , there 's a little hitch , from his point of view . " " What 's the hitch ? " " Well , see , when he was a youngster , his folks were awfully poor . They had this little store where he used to help out right after school . So at the time , when he was thirteen , they could n't afford to have a Bar Mitzvah for him . " The rabbi smiled . " So ? " " So it bothers him . He feels he 's not really a bona fide Jew . He 's that kind of guy  --  awfully sincere . All the different cities they lived in  --  see , they moved around a lot because he 'd take over a corporation , in Detroit , say , and they 'd move there , and then they 'd trade it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd move there , living in hotels all the time  --  so in all these cities , he never joined a synagogue , mostly I guess because he never got around to it , and was n't planning to stay long , in any case , but also because he felt he was n't really a Jew , not having been Bar Mitzvah . " " But surely , you explained  --  " " But here , he 's planning to stay , " Maltzman hurried on . " He did n't get control of Rohrbough to trade it . He 's planning to run it , and he 's planning on building a house in the area and living here . He wants to become part of the community . That 's when I braced him about joining our temple , and he springs that Bar Mitzvah thing on me . I was just going to tell him it made no difference , when his wife tells how she heard about some old geezer of seventy out in California who just got himself Bar Mitzvahed , and why could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me  --  the gimmick ! " " The gimmick ? " " That 's right . Ever since I became president , and even before , I 've been searching for a gimmick , the gimmick that would sell the temple . You got something to sell , you need a gimmick . In my line , when I first started selling houses , it was tiled bathrooms with glass shower doors . You had a house that was built solid with nice large sunny rooms in a nice location , it did n't mean a thing without a tiled bathroom . It caught the eye . It did n't have a tiled58bathroom , forget it . Well , after a while all houses had tiled baths , so you had to come up with another gimmick . So they came up with tiled kitchens . Then it was kitchens with wood cabinets . Then rumpus rooms . Then finished cellars with a bar . Get the idea ? So when I became president of the temple , and decided that what we needed was more members , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been racking my brains for a gimmick . And then Mrs. Segal tells about the old guy who was Bar Mitzvah , and her husband is interested , and right away I 've got my gimmick . He wants a Bar Mitzvah ? Swell ! We 'll give him a real one . We 'll send out invitations to every Jew in the community , members and nonmembers . You are cordially invited to join with us in worship and attend the Bar Mitzvah of Benjamin Segal . ' We 'd do it up brown . He 'd make the usual speech  --  " " Today , I am a man ? " Maltzman grinned . " Sure , why not ? I 'll bet he 'll go along . Then I 'd make my little president 's speech and give him a prayerbook like we give all the Bar Mitzvahs . And then you 'd give him your blessing and make your little speech the way you usually do . Then we 'd have a party in the vestry so he could get to meet everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of fountain pens as a gag  --  " " Fountain pens ? " " Oh , I guess that was before your time . But when I was a kid , a fountain pen was the most popular gift for the Bar Mitzvah boy . Not ballpoints , but the kind with a gold nib that you fill yourself from a bottle . See , the kid would be going on to high school where he 'd need it . They cost anywhere from a couple of dollars to fifteen or twenty , so it was a pretty good gift , too . Gosh , when I was Bar Mitzvah , I must 've got half a dozen . I wore them all in my breast pocket the next day , so I looked like the doorman at the Russian Samovar . Segal is my age , so he 'll know about it and get a kick out of it . " " I see . " " So is it all set ? " " No , it 's not all set , Mr. Maltzman . I certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bar Mitzvah when he was thirteen whether he knows it or not . There 's no special rite or ritual required . It 's automatic . It 's not like baptism . It is n't initiationinto the religion or the tribe . That 's what circumcision is . If Mr. Segal feels that he wants to be rededicated to the religion of59his fathers , it would make more sense if he had himself circumcisedagain . " " That 's crazy ! " The rabbi nodded . " But at least it has some justification in logic . Bar Mitzvah , though , merely means that one is of age , old enough and presumably mature enough to take responsibility for one 's own actions and sins . It 's just like becoming twenty-one , or eighteen , or whatever the age is now where you can make your own contracts . No special ceremony is required , no party and no speeches . When you 're twenty-one you can vote or make a contract . Well , that 's all that Bar Mitzvah means , that you are of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Reading in the Scroll . " " That 's because , as an adult , you 're now a member of the community . It 's a courtesy we extend to any new person in the community , or to a stranger who happens to be present . In the morningservices when we read from the Scroll , if there 's someone present whom I have n't seen before , I always offer him the opportunity . You 'd know that if you came to the minyan occasionally . " " But that old guy on the West Coast  --  " " I ca n't be responsible for what happens on the West Coast . " " And in other places , too . In the Hadassah Journal there was a picture of a whole group , all senior citizens , that went to Israel and had a mass Bar Mitzvah at the Wall . " Beads of perspiration began to appear on Maltzman 's forehead . The rabbi shook his head . " I ca n't answer for the judgment of any other rabbi . I interpret the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changing the meaning or the interpretation of an old and treasuredtradition . The whole business of ceremonies of confirmation and rededication , it 's foreign to us . We confirm our faith every time we perform one of the commandments , every time we recite our prayers or make one of the blessings or gain some new insight into our religion . The rabbis of old warned against making unnecessaryvows . It suggests that we might be taking the name of the Lord in vain . In fact , on Yom Kippur , in the Kol Nidre prayer , we ask to be released from vows , rather than the other way around . Of course , if you want to throw a party in the vestry for this Ben Segal , I ca n't stop you , although I might question the propriety and the good taste of having a party to celebrate the signing up of a new member just because he 's rich . But what happens before60the Ark and the Scrolls of the Law is within my jurisdiction , and I can not permit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed . He rose so abruptly that the chair fell over . He glared at the rabbi for a moment and then bent over and picked up the chair . Erect once again , he appeared to have recovered his composure . He even smiled . " We 'll see about that , Rabbi . " Then he turned and left the room. 13THE GUESTS HAD ALL ARRIVED BY THE TIME HENRY MALTZMANgot home . His wife , Laura , could tell by the violent way he shrugged out of his topcoat that something was wrong . " Did you see the rabbi ? " she asked . " Yeah , I saw him . " He strode into the living room . " Hello you folks . Sorry I 'm late . I had to see our spiritual leader . " His sarcasm revealed to his wife that he was angry and it worried her . " I think we can eat now , " she announced brightly and led the way into the dining room . She served the soup from a tureen on a side table and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup should be piping hot . " " Needs salt , " grumbled her husband . " Delicious , absolutely delicious , " said Mrs. Streitfuss . " It has a special taste . Lentils ? " " Lima beans , " said Laura . " The big ones . I let them dissolve , and it gives a special flavor . " " You must give me the recipe . " " Now , that 's what I call soup , " said Allen Glick . " Why ca n't you make soup like that ? " he asked his wife . As Laura cleared the dishes for the next course , her husband , who had been silent up till now , leaned back in his chair and said , " You people hear about the Segal Group taking over the RohrboughCorporation ? " " Oh , that was reported in the papers last week , " said Roger Streitfuss , " at least , that it was in the works . " " Well , it 's all set , " said Maltzman , " and what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is going to run the place personally . He and his missus are in town right now . And  --  now get this  --  they 're joining our temple . " " Hey , how about that ! " exclaimed Herb Mandell. 62 " Imagine , a big shot financier like that comes to town , and first thing he does is want to join a temple . " Allen Glick shook his head in wonder . " Well , I would n't put it that way exactly , " said Maltzman . " I mean , he 's not one of those pious Jews who ca n't live without a synagogue . As a matter of fact , he did n't think of himself as a Jew at all . Oh , born one and all that , and not denying it , but he never had a Bar Mitzvah on account his folks were so poor at the time , so he did n't think of himself as a real Jew . See what I mean ? " " Well , I do n't think  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Maltzman held up his hand to still the babble . " I read that articlein the Hadassah Journal , too . It 's the one about that group of old geezers from California who went to the Wall in Jerusalem to be Bar Mitzvah . Right ? Well , I told him about it , and he was willing . " He looked around the table to gather their attention . " Then I got an idea . You know , all along I 've been saying we ought to do something to bring in new members . I figure there are at least a hundred Jewish families in town , maybe more , that do n't belong to the temple . Maybe they 're not sure they 're going to stay on in town . Maybe they have n't been approached right . " " Maybe they do n't want to join a temple where women are second-class citizens , " said Molly Mandell . Maltzman nodded . " Maybe . Anyway , I 've always thought if we could get the right gimmick , we could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time I had it . Here 's this big shot , and he 's going to be running Rohrbough , and some of our people work there . Now , he feels funny about never having been Bar Mitzvah , feels he is n't really a Jew , and yet with a name like Segal , he feels he ca n't be anything else , unless he changes his name , and he would n't do that . So it came to me  --  the gimmick . I could kill two birds with one stone . Why do n't we give him a Bar Mitzvah , the temple , I mean . And we send out invitations to all the Jews in town , whether they 're members of the temple or not  --  ' You are cordially invited to join us in worship and the celebration of the Bar Mitzvah of Mr. Ben Segal of Chicago  --  ' Get it ? " He could tell from their faces that they did , that they all thought it as wonderful an idea as he did . " So I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late gettinghome. " 63 " And ? " " And nothing . He would n't hear of it . Said it was against our religion . That you 're Bar Mitzvah when you become thirteen whether you want to or not . And he would n't have anything to do with it . " " Well ... " " Seems to me my father said that . " " I do n't understand . Would n't they know in Jerusalem ? " " And the Hadassah people would know , would n't they ? " " I guess our rabbi knows better , " said Maltzman bitterly . " He says he 's not responsible for what other rabbis do . This is n't the first time  --  " " Maybe he feels you 're against him , " suggested his wife , as she entered to serve the main course . " All the other presidents invited him to sit in on the board of directors ' meetings and you never did . If he were at the meeting and something came up  --  " Maltzman was exasperated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different kind of meeting now . Until we reformed the bylaws , practically anybody could come to the meetings . There were fortyfivedirectors plus all the past presidents . We held the meetings Sunday mornings when people came to bring their kids to the Sunday School , or when they came to the morning minyan . So those who were on the board , some of them would stay for the meeting . It was a crazy system . There 'd be only about fifteen or twenty present at most meetings , but if something was proposed and somebody was against it , they 'd spend the week calling all the members of the board , and the next meeting , when it was to be voted on , there 'd be forty or more , and it would be voted down . You could never transact any business . Well , now we have a board of fifteen , and it 's like an executive committee . And we meet in the afternoon . And it 's every other week , instead of every week . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chew the fat . Everybody who is supposed to comes . If someone stays away two or three meetings , he 's dropped , and I 'm empoweredto appoint someone to take his place the way I appointed Herb Mandell here when Joe Cohen found he could n't make it regular . So , even if I invited the rabbi to attend the meetings , he would be unable to come every meeting . He has a wedding or a funeral or some other kind of meeting he has to go to on a Sunday afternoon . And if he did n't come every week , we 'd have to spend time when he did come explaining what the points at issue were . " 64 " It seems to me , " said Molly Mandell placidly , " the big mistakewe made was in giving the rabbi a lifetime contract . " " We did n't give him a lifetime contract , " said Roger Streitfuss . " We offered him one and he refused it . A couple of years back , I think it was . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . " " That 's right , " said Maltzman . " It was the year he went to Israel . Maybe thought he might want to go back there and did n't want to be bound by a long-term contract . " " So how do you work it ? " asked Molly , interested . " Do you meet with him on the terms every year and then draw up a con-tract ? " " Oh no . His salary is just one item in the budget . When the board votes the budget , the secretary sends him a letter telling him his contract has been renewed for the year . And that 's it . " " And what would happen if you wrote him and said it had n't been renewed ? " asked Allen Glick . " I 'm just asking , you under-stand . " " Gosh , I do n't know . I suppose he 'd  --  I do n't know what he 'd do , " said Maltzman . " I bet he 'd resign , " said Roger Streitfuss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's fought for his job . But he 's never actually had an official vote passed against him . " " You got a point there , " said Allen Glick . " What else could he do but resign ? Either that , or appeal to the board to reconsider . And he 's too proud for that . " " With fifteen on the board , it only takes eight to vote the rabbi out , " remarked Streitfuss and then added vehemently , " If the matter came up , I 'd vote against him . " The others understood his feeling . They all knew about the rabbi 's refusal to participate in a joint wedding ceremony with a Methodist minister when the Streitfuss girl had married a Gentile . " And I would , too , " Allen Glick said . " What about you , Herb ? You 're on the board now . You 've got a vote . " " Oh , Herb would go along , " said Molly before her husband could answer for himself . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality for women in the service and make this a modern , up-todatetemple , we 've got to get Rabbi Small out and get in a rabbi who 'll push for it . " " So you 've got three votes already , " Streitfuss said . " All you need , Henry , is five more . " Maltzman 's eyes gleamed . He rubbed his hands . " Yeah , I think we might be able to bring it off . " 65Smiles appeared on the faces of his guests . " But we 've got to be awfully careful about this , " Maltzman went on . " It 's got to be kept secret , because if the opposition gets wind of it ... " 14STANLEY DOBLE , THE JANITOR AT THE TEMPLE , WAS NOT THE ideal employee . For one thing , he was unreliable . He had been known to interrupt a job of work , presumably to go for his lunch , and not return for several days because he had met someone who had suggested they drive up to Maine to bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although , in all fairness , usually on his own time . On the other hand , he was an accomplished handyman , who could do a skillful job of carpentry , repair the plumbing , maintain the heating and air-conditioning system and was knowledgeable about electricity . While frequently exasperated by his lapses , the temple authorities felt that on the whole , it was a fair trade-off . Moreover , since the wages they paid him were not high , they winked at the outside jobs he took on . Most of the time , he was dressed in a dirty T-shirt and greasestainedoveralls and sported a two days ' growth of beard . When shaved , and with hair combed and wearing his " good clothes , " however , he was quite presentable . Although not tall , he was powerfullybuilt and carried himself with a kind of truculence , as if to warn taller men that he was not to be trifled with . His face was coarse and fleshy , and his eyes small with the lids half-closed , as though he were peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little askew at the tip , having been smashed once in a fight . But while not an attractive man , he was usually good-natured and friendly . He was not wearing his good clothes when Martha Peterson bumped into him at the supermarket downtown , and there was a smudge of grease on his cheek , which was why she refused his invitation to " come and have a soda " at the drugstore . But when he asked for a date , she said , " Well , I 'm free tonight . " His face fell . " Aw , Marty , today 's Friday , they got a service at67the temple tonight and I got to clean up afterward . I was thinking about tomorrow night . " Because she felt it was important for her to maintain her status as the arbitrary , even capricious , conferer of favors , she said loftily , " I 'm sorry , but tonight is the only night I 'm free . " And since the immediate was always more important to him than the responsibility of a later time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I can make some arrangement at the temple . I 'll pick you up at your place around seven . " " No , you pick me up at work . " " Why ca n't I pick you up at your place ? " " On account I do n't want to go home by bus . I left my car to be serviced , so I wo n't have it to go home with . " " Aw , gee , Marty . " " What difference does it make to you ? " she asked . " Well , your boss , old man Jordon , him and me had a fight about some work I done for him , and I said I 'd never set foot in his place again . " " You afraid of him ? " " Afraid ? But where I said I would n't . . " " Well , if you ca n't , I guess there 's other fish in the sea . " He looked at her calculatingly through slitted eyes . It occurred to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would feel obligated and make suitable recompense . " All right , " he said decisively . " I 'll pick you up at seven , but you be ready now , so when I ring the bell  --  " " I 'll be ready . " 15LAWRENCE GORE LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY AS MOLLY MANDELLentered his office . " I know you do n't like me to bother you , but Mr. Jordon  --  " " Was he in this morning ? " he asked quickly . " Did he  --  er  --  try to annoy you again ? " She blushed . " No , he has n't been in . But the report  --  " He held up a finger . " Right . The Ellsworth Jordon quarterly report . It 's due today . I have n't forgotten it . As a matter of fact , I spoke to him this morning . " He tilted back in his swivel chair . " And he invited me for dinner tonight . " " So he can go over the report with you ? " " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup tu-reen . " " So he finally decided to let you borrow it for the exhibition ? " " Oh , I think he was going to all along . It 's just his way . But I called him this morning and told him I was taking the collection to the museum tonight and it was now or never . So he said okay , I could pick it up this evening and he invited me to dinner . " " How are you taking it in ? " she asked curiously . " In my beachwagon . " " You going alone ? " " Sure . Why not ? " " Because it 's very valuable , is n't it ? " " It sure is . " " You ought to have someone with you . You could get into an accident and  --  " " You 're right , Molly , as usual . " He thought for a minute . " I 'll ask Billy . Have him come in , will you , Molly . " When the young man appeared , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , to the museum tonight . How would you like to come along and ride shotgun ? " " Gee , that would be swell . Shall I meet you at your house ? What time ? " " Oh , I 'm coming to your house . The old man invited me to dinner . I 'm picking up his soup tureen  --  ' " I knew he was going to let you have it . He had Martha shine it up the other day . " " So it 's all set . We 'll go back to my place right after dinner , and you can help me load the stuff in the car . " Molly reminded Gore of the Jordon report again at noon , and he said he 'd get on it as soon as he returned from lunch . But he met some customers at lunch and it was after two when he got back . When she asked him about it once again , he said , " I 've been thinking it over . If I bring it with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss it item by item . I could be there till midnight . I 'll tell him I 'm sending it by mail . " " But he is such a stickler for getting his reports on the day they 're due . And it 's due today . " He grinned impishly at her . " Well , that still gives me until midnight . And if it 's dropped in the mail after five it will be too late for the Saturday delivery . So I could drop it off at the post office anytime during the weekend , and he 'd still get it Monday . " She looked doubtful , and asked , " Is it something I can do ? " He pinched his lower lip , looking at her speculatively . " You know , as a matter of fact , you can . There 's really nothing very involved . Here , let me show you . " He got out the Ellsworth Jordon folder . " These are purchases and these represent sales , mostly stocks , but there are some real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " I had some bookkeeping in high school . " " Believe me , that 's good enough . That and your good common sense . All you have to do is list these in one column and these in another . You itemize them , of course , but it 's pretty much all spelled out . Just follow the form on the earlier reports and do a good typing job . " She was not nearly finished by closing time , but she offered to work on it at home . " I hate to ask you to , " he said . " You 're not asking me . I 'm volunteering . " " But wo n't Herb  --  " 70 " Herb is running the Brotherhood service at the temple tonight . And I 've got to stay home anyway to baby-sit for his mother . " " Then she  --  " " She goes right upstairs after dinner , and by eight o'clock she 's fast asleep . Really , I do n't mind . It will give me something to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . I 'll make it up to you . " 16MALTZMAN HEARD THE PHONE RINGING JUST AS HE GOT TO THEdoor . He hurriedly fished for his key on the chance it was for him . Sure enough , as he opened the door , he heard his wife say , " Oh , he 's coming in right now . Just a minute . " She cupped her hand over the mouthpiece and whispered , " It 's Mr. Segal . " He took the instrument from her and said , " Mr. Segal ? How are you ? . . . Fine . . . No , not yet . I tried to contact him a couple of times and was unable to reach him . . . Yeah , I understand . . . I 'll get hold of him in the next day or two . . . Oh sure , I 'll let you know as soon as I hear . . . Fine . . . Fine . . . Bye now . " He replaced the receiver and explained , " About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they want something , and they think you get it "  --  he snapped his fingers  --  " just like that . " " And did you try to contact Ellsworth Jordon ? " " Of course not , but I do n't have to tell him that . " " Are you worried that  --  " " I 'm worried that Ellsworth Jordon might not want to deal with me and will say that the land is not for sale . Or he might ask some ridiculous price that even Ben Segal would n't be willing to pay . " " Maybe you could get somebody else , Dalton Realty maybe , to front for you ? " " And split the commission ? Like hell . " " So what are you planning to do ? " " I do n't know . I 'll have to think about it . I might see Larry Gore , who handles some of his business . He 's a reasonable guy , and I know he thinks well of me because he recommended me to Segal . I could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe  --  " " Maybe you 're just imagining things , Henry , " said his wife. 72 " Maybe you 're just working yourself up like the man in that story who goes to borrow a lawn mower from his neighbor . Jordon might be anxious to sell . At least , you ought to ask him . " He pursed his lips as he considered . " You know , Laura , you got a point . I 'll call that sonofabitch right now and lay it on the line . Hand me the phone . " " Why do n't you wait until tomorrow to call ? " she urged . He stared at her . " Tomorrow ? Saturday ? Why tomorrow ? " " Well , you know you always feel better , more relaxed after  --  after  --  " " I feel relaxed enough right now . Give me that Goddam phone . " 17WHEN BILLY OPENED THE DOOR TO ADMIT LAWRENCE GORE , JOR- don called out from the living room , " You 're late , Larry . " A mo- ment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage clock on the mantelpiece . Gore looked at his wristwatch . " Are you sure , Ellsworth ? Mine says just six . " " You bet I 'm sure . That clock is absolutely right . I check it every day with the radio time signals . You 're five minutes late . " " Well , I 'm sorry , Ellsworth . " He slid the bracelet off his wrist and , peering at the clock , made a show of resetting his watch . " All right , all right , let 's not waste any more time , " said the old man , as though conceding a major point . " Martha 's got a date for tonight and wants to leave early , so let 's not keep her waiting . " And waving his arms , he shooed Gore and Billy into the dining room . As Gore spread his napkin , he remarked , " Albert Megrim was in this morning . He said you were planning to blackball someone I proposed for the Agathon , Ben Segal . " Jordon chortled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ago , Henry Maltzman called me about buying my land on the Point for this same Ben Segal . " " He told you who his principal was ? That does n't sound like Henry Maltzman . " " I told him I would n't even discuss it with him unless he did . " " Well , I guess he figures you would n't do him out of his com- mission . " " No commission . " " But  --  " " I turned him down . " He smiled broadly . Gore looked mystified . " You know this man , Segal ? " 74 " Nope . Never laid eyes on him . " " Then . . . " Gore took a swallow of water . " This Ben Segal is from Chicago . He 's a big financier . He 's taking over the RohrboughCorporation and plans to operate it . Now the last time I went over your holdings with you , that land on the Point was one of the properties you said you wanted to sell . Considering the price you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer in a hurry . I 'd say Ben Segal is the best chance you 're going to have in a long time . " " That so ? Big financier , is he ? " He drummed the table . " That 's right . There was an article on him in Business Week about a month ago . I took him to the Agathon for lunch , and he liked what he saw and what he had to eat . And asked me to put him up for membership . Just like that . Did n't ask what the dues were or the initiation fee . And it is n't as though he 's interested in yachts , or in any of the facilities the club has to offer . It was just that it seemed to him a nice place to dine . A man like that is n't apt to haggle over the price of a piece of land he 's set his heart on . " " Well , " said Jordon with a sour grin , " I did n't actually close the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't like to talk figures over the phone , because he asked if he could come and see me and talk about it . So I told him he could come at half past eight tonight . " " Oh , well , that 's all right then . " Gore was much relieved . " I told him , " the old man went on , " that I knew he was president of the temple and that since there is a service there at half past eight on Friday nights , according to the bulletin outside , I wanted to see which counted more with him , his commission or his religion . " The old man put his head back and laughed obscenely . Billy looked doubtfully at the old man as though wondering if he were joking . Gore pretended to be amused . " And what did he say to that ? " he asked . " He said if he did come it would be to put a bullet through my head . " " There ! " Gore smiled his satisfaction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you find another buyer who 'll pay you half of what you 're asking . " " You think so ? " Jordon put down his soup spoon and reaching back , took out his wallet from his back pocket . From it he drew a75dollar bill and laid it on the table beside his plate . " You want to bet Maltzman wo n't show at half past eight ? " " Sure . " " Then let 's see your money . " " You mean you want me to  --  " Gore drew a dollar bill from his pocket and placed it on the table . " That 's fine . Now we 'll let Billy hold the stakes . It will give him a sense of responsibility . " Martha came in to clear away the soup plates . She waited while the old man hastily tilted his plate , the better to take the last few spoonfuls . " You kind of hurrying us , Martha ? " he asked . " I saw you were n't eating . " " Well , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm done now . Heavy date tonight ? " " Just a date , " she said and went out to bring in the main course . Later , when she came back to clear the table , Jordon asked teasingly , " Who is he , Martha ? Who 's your date tonight ? " " None of your business , " she answered tartly . The old man roared with laughter . " Now that 's a girl with spirit , " he exclaimed approvingly . " Cummon , let 's go into the liv- ing room . We 'll have our coffee there , and it will give her a chance to clean up in here . " When Martha served the coffee a few minutes later , she had al- ready changed to her street clothes . " You going now ? " Jordon asked . " Pretty soon , " she replied . " I 'm waiting for my date . " " You mean he 's going to call you ? " " He 's picking me up here . My car is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is he ? What did you say his name was ? " " I did n't say . " " Well now , Martha , let 's understand each other , " he said pleas- antly . " Whom you go out with is your business , but who comes to my house is my business . " His voice had taken on an edge , and because she did n't think it worth fighting about , she shrugged , " It 's Stanley Doble . I guess you know him . " " Yes , I know him , " he said grimly . " And I wo n't have it . " " What do you mean you wo n't have it ? " " I mean , I wo n't have him in my house . " She smiled thinly . " I guess he do n't care any more for you than you do for him . So when he rings the bell  --  " 76 " He 'll still be trespassing on my land . You want to meet him , you can go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , you . . . " She stared at him in disbelief . Then she turned and strode swiftly out of the room . She was back a moment later , in her coat and clutching her handbag . She held a key which she shook under his nose . " Here 's your key . " She opened her hand and let the key drop in his lap . " I wo n't need it anymore . I 'm not coming back . You can get yourself another girl . " She walked to the front door , jerked it open and then slammed it to behind her . Billy looked from Jordon to Gore as if seeking an attitude to emulate . Ellsworth Jordon , while obviously taken aback , did not seem too upset . Gore had an enigmatic smile on his lips . " Now you 've done it , Ellsworth , " he said with quiet satisfaction . " There 's a limit to how much you can push people around . Now you 're going to have to find yourself another house-keeper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry , " said Jordon contemptuously . " She 'll be back . " Gore was puzzled  --  and interested . " How do you figure ? " The older man smiled . " Today is the thirty-first , is n't it ? Well , I have n't given her her monthly check yet . So maybe she 'll wait until Monday or Tuesday to see if she gets it in the mail . Or she may come for it , probably tomorrow . Maybe even tonight after you folks have gone . And there 'll be remarks made that will lead to a rip-roaring argument . And after the air has cleared , we 'll both admit to having acted a bit hastily . " " You really are a nasty old curmudgeon , " said Gore , not without a touch of admiration . The older man preened himself , and Billy thought it tactful to remark , " Martha blows up quick , but she gets over it quick , too . " " Well , there you are , Larry , " said Jordon . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at the quarterly report  --  " " Oh , I did n't bring it with me , " said Gore easily . " It was n't finished when I left . " " That report is due today , " said Jordon in a dry , flat voice . " No , Ellsworth . We 're supposed to send it out today . That means any time before midnight  --  " The old man pounded the arm of his chair . His face grew red . " Goddammit , I talked to you about it on the phone , and then I suggested you come here for dinner . You knew I meant for you to bring it with you . " 77The doorbell rang . Instantly Jordon 's mood changed . He rubbed his hands in satisfaction . " That will be Martha come back . Go to the door , Billy . But if she has that scallywag Doble with her , tell her I wo n't see her and I wo n't talk to her . " Billy opened the door and saw Stanley alone framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha Peterson ? " he asked . " Gee , she 's not here  --  " " Is that you , Doble ? " Jordon rose from his chair and walked toward the entrance hall . In a loud hectoring voice , he said , " I told you I did n't want you setting foot in this house again . Now get out or I 'll call the police . " " I come for Martha Peterson , " Stanley said doggedly . " Well , she 's not here . She does n't work here anymore . " " That 's right , " said Billy . " She quit when he told her he would n't allow you to come here . " " Why . . . " Stanley pushed past Billy , his arms raised , his hands outstretched as though he were going to grab the old man by the neck . Gore , who had followed Jordon into the hall , came between them . He put his hands against Doble 's chest . In a low voice , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get yourself in a mess of trouble . Martha is waiting for you down by the gate . " " I did n't see her . " " You probably did n't notice her as you swung into the drive , " Gore said soothingly . " But she 's down there waiting . You better go . She might not wait too long . " Stanley permitted himself to be eased toward the door . On the threshold , he stopped and shook his fist . " You 're a miserable old sonofabitch , Jordon , and if you 're lying , do n't think I wo n't come back . " When he had finally closed the door on Stanley Doble , Gore asked , " What did he ever do to you , Ellsworth , that you 're so down on him ? " The old man waved a hand negligently . " Oh , it was over a job of work I hired him for some months back . That front door was sticking , and I engaged him to fix it . He took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it still was n't right . And he would n't fix it without I paid him extra . " " It seems to work all right . " 78 " No , the lock does n't catch right . She wo n't close unless you pull her to real hard . " " And for that , you told him  --  " " For that and on account of the words we had about it . When I strike a bargain with someone , I expect to keep my part of it , and I expect him to keep his . He said I engaged him just to plane down the door , and my point was that I hired him to fix the door . Now that means it 's got to be right . " " Well , all I can say is , it 's a lucky thing for you that I was here . He was in an ugly mood , and you could have got yourself a punch in the nose . " " Oh , I could have handled him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You , Billy ? What could you have done ? Doble is as strong as an ox . He could toss you over his shoulder with one hand . " " Yeah , but I got me an equalizer . " Billy tugged at his belt and with a flourish brought forth a revolver . Gore shouted , " Put that damn thing down . " " You crazy ? " cried Jordon . " Where 'd you get it ? " " It 's from my cage in the bank , " said Billy sheepishly . " Mr. Gore asked me to ride shotgun taking the silver to the museum . " " You young idiot ! I do n't need any protection . " Gore turned to Jordon . " I said it jokingly when I invited him to come along with me tonight . Everybody knows it just means sitting beside the driver . " " Do n't you know that in this state if you 're caught with a gun you get a year in prison and no one can get you out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time I think you 're beginning to grow up and be a man , you pull some damn fool stunt like this and I know you 're still nothing but an immature kid . Now you put that gun on the table there and march straight into your room . And I 'm locking you in . " " Oh stink ! " But nevertheless , the young man deposited the gun on the table , and sheepishly with head lowered and not looking at either of the two men , he went to his room and closed the door behind him . Ellsworth Jordon calmly turned the key that protruded from the lock and then returned to the recliner . Gore looked at him uncertainly , went to the door of Billy 's room and listened for a moment . Then he rejoined the older man . " That was pretty harsh on Billy , " said Gore . " Harsh ? I should have taken a stick to him . " 79 " Maybe that would have been better , instead of sending him to his room like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , you 're not his father . " The old man remained silent . The ghost of a smile appeared on his lips . Gore noticed it and a wild idea came to him . " Or are you ? " he asked . " Is Billy your son ? " Jordon leaned his head back against the cushion of the recliner and closed his eyes . " Is that it ? And you wanted him to work in a bank to get trainingin handling money . " " You 're beginning to annoy me , Larry , " the older man murmuredwithout opening his eyes . " Beat it . The bowl is in the cartonnear the door . Take it and be off . This is my regular time for Transcendental Meditation . " " And Billy ? You going to leave him there ? " With his eyes still closed , Jordon smiled and said nothing . Gore rose and stood looking down uncertainly at the now placidface of his host . Jordon was breathing slowly and regularly , his lips moving barely perceptibly in the recital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel. 18LAWRENCE GORE EASED HIS CAR SLOWLY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY , looking carefully from side to side . Gaining the street , he drove to his own house on the outskirts of town to pick up the cartons of the Peter Archer silver . By eight o'clock he was on the highway heading for Boston . As he drove , he thought of the events of the evening . He was quite certain now that Billy was Jordon 's son . He wondered if Billy knew , if that was the reason for his docility . He tried to think of himself at Billy 's age . Would he have tolerated such discipline if he had been visiting with a friend of his parents ? Or would he have packed up and gone home ? But suppose he did n't have a home ? That his parents were dead ? Or suppose his parents had explained to him that they were indebted to his host and that he must on no account offend him ? He smiled wryly as it occurred to him that he himself tolerated a lot from Ellsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the distance he saw the lights of a gas station , and he decided to stop there rather than take a chance that there would be another open at this hour . He pulled in and circled well beyond the pumps . Leaving his car , he walked over to the office , and extendinga dollar bill , he asked , " Can I have some change so I can use the pay station ? " " It 's out of order . The phone company fixes them , and the next day they 're on the blink again . Kids come along at night after we close and plug them up so they can get whatever coins have dropped in the meantime . Or sometimes out of pure cussedness . " " Is there another pay station this side of the road before the tunnel ? " " There 's one in the office . You can use that . " He led the way81into the office , and ringing up No Sale on the register , handed Gore change for his bill . Gore dialed and whistled tonelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Molly ? This is Lawrence Gore . How are you coming along with the report ? " " Well , I 've gone over it again and again , but I could n't make the two columns balance . So I typed it up anyway . " " You sure you put all the items I marked A in one column and the L 's in the other ? " " Uh-huh . I 've checked it and checked it . " " Then I must have marked one of them wrong . " " Maybe I could ask Herb to look it over and  --  " " Oh no , you must n't do that , Molly , " he said quickly . " It 's bank business and strictly confidential . " " Oh , I just thought  --  well , of course I wo n't . Was Mr. Jordon angry about your not bringing it with you ? " " You better believe it . I thought he was going to have a fit . All that got me off the hook was that I pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get back early enough to pick it up and drop it off to him , but looking over the instructions from the museum , I see they expect to inventory the stuff in my presence , item by item . That can take some time , and I do n't think I 'll be able to make it . " She could tell that he was concerned . " I could run it up to him right now , " she offered . " Except it does n't balance . " " Oh , well , he 'll spot the mistake in a minute . He 'll rib me about it when he sees me , but  --  No , I ca n't have you do it . Not where he 's  --  No , you 'd be going there alone and  --  " " You think I 'm afraid of him ? " He smiled at her typical Women 's Lib reaction . He glanced at the large wall clock . " Well , if you 're sure it 's no trouble and you do n't mind  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're a sweetheart . " " I 'm doing it for the bank , " she said severely . " Of course . " 19THE RINGING OF THE TELEPHONE AWAKENED OLD MRS . MANDELL . Not that she had been asleep , for she insisted that she never really slept , just kind of dozed . It had interrupted a dream  --  well , not reallya dream , since dreams were a function of sleep . Rather a kind of fantasy that would come to her whenever she dozed off . Althoughthere were variations in detail , the general theme was the same ; how things would be if She ( which was the way she referred to her daughter-in-law ) were gone . Occasionally , the dream was about the nature of her leaving  --  a fatal accident , a drowning , perhaps , in which Herbert had displayed tremendous courage in his effort to rescue her . He would be grief-stricken , of course , but it would have the effect of drawing him closer to his mother ; after a while , he would get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy would deter him from marrying again . Then there followed a series of vignettes of their blissful life togetherwhen there were only the two of them . At breakfast  --  she was sure she 'd be able to manage  --  and he would exclaim over its excellence . " Gee , Ma , this coffee , it 's out of this world . And this oatmeal ! How do you get it so smooth and creamy ? " And when he left for work , he would buss her boyishly and say , " Now you take it easy , sweetheart . Leave the dishes , and I 'll do them when I get home . " For dinner she would prepare his favorite foods , the rich and spicy dishes he enjoyed so much , and afterward they would spend the evening watching TV or playing endless games of Scrabble , which she adored . She did not want him to feel that he was obligated to her and would suggest , " Why do n't you go out and visit your friends , Herbert ? Take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " And he would answer , " Why , Ma , you 're my best girl . " Or it might be that She was no longer there because he had83divorced her . He had finally realized that She was unworthy of him and that he could not continue to live with her . Then she might picture him as remarried . His new wife was a shadowy figure , vaguely resembling a buxom Polish maid she had once had , who would give birth almost every year , all boys , and all looking like Herbert . They would crowd around their grandmother , each like one of the pictures of Herbert , at different ages , as he was growing up , pushing and jostling each other to claim her attention . " Grandma , look at me . " Herbert would be beside her and would good-naturedly push them away with , " Go on and play . You 're tiring Grandma . " Their mother never appeared in any of these scenes . With so large a brood , she was naturally busy , cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly answer the phone but could not hear what She said , of course . She lay in bed debating whether to put on the light and read for a while , or try to go back to sleep , or maybe even get up and go downstairs for a cup of tea . Before she could come to a decision , she heard footsteps on the stairs , slow , careful footsteps , and then the door of her bedroom quietly opened . She pretended to be asleep . The door closed and the footsteps retreated down the stairs . A little later , she heard the sound of an automobile starting up , seemingly right below her window . Mystified , she got out of bed , went to the window and cautiously drew back the curtain just in time to see Molly 's coupe ease down the driveway . Where could She be going ? Had something happened to Herbert ? Had the call come from the temple ? But what could happen to him in the temple ? Mrs. Mandell snicked on her bed lamp and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past eight . Gathering a kimono around her , she went downstairs . The lights in the living room were still on , and she padded about in her mules , looking at the papers on the desk where She had been typing . It occurred to her that She might have gone to mail something . But why now ? The next collection would not be made until tomorrow morning . And it could n't be to buy something , like cigarettes or a magazine at the drugstore . All the stores were closed by this time . Besides , her leaving must have something to do with the phone call She had received . Some friends must have called her and  --  could it have been a man friend ? Was She taking advantage of Herbert 's being at the temple to meet a lover ? Mrs. Mandell felt faint at the idea and thought she had better get back to her own room to take a pill , to lie down if necessary. 84The more she thought about it , the stronger grew the probability of her daughter-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scenarios that she had fantasized as a means of ending the marriage , because  --  because in her mind it would make her son look ridiculous . But now she thought about it because she had to . What should she do ? How should she proceed ? Of course , if Herbertcame home first , that would take care of it . On her return , he would confront her and demand an explanation . But what if She got back first ? She heard a car turn into the quiet street . Her breast filled with a great hope that it might be her son . But a glance at the clock showed that it was a little after nine , too early for him to be coming home from the temple . It must be She returning . Gripping the handrail , she hurriedly mounted the stairs and got back into bed . A few minutes later the car pulled into the driveway , and shortly after she again heard footsteps on the stairs and then the door of her room being eased open . Again she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard the door pulled to and footsteps retreating down the stairs . I20IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE ATTENDANCE , HENRY MALTZMAN had suggested to the temple Brotherhood that they actively sponsorthe Friday evening services . " What do you mean , sponsor ? " asked Howard Jonas , the president of the Brotherhood . " You know , sponsor . Get behind the idea and push . Drum up attendance . Decorate the pulpit . Make arrangements for the collationafterward . " " But that 's what the Sisterhood does . " " Yeah , so why should n't the Brotherhood take a crack at it for a change ? It will spark things up , the competition . " " You mean , at the collation , the men would pour the tea ? For the women ? One lump or two , Mrs. FeldmanT Cummon ! That 's a woman 's job , Henry . " But Maltzman was persuasive , and they finally agreed to do it one Friday in the month , the other Fridays continuing under the supervision of the women . So this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the affair , standing at the front door of the temple with Howard Jonas , greeting congregantsas they arrived . For this , the first such service , they had sent out cards to all the members . More , they had gone through the Barnard 's Crossing phone directory and sent cards of invitation to any whose names suggested they might be Jewish . " So if we make a mistake and send a card to a Gentile and he takes us up on it and comes , what harm will it do ? It 's like ecumenical . " Mandell took his responsibilities seriously . Whenever there was a lull , he would leave his post at the door to dash down to the vestry to see how the arrangements for the collation were going . Since he was the lead tenor in the Brotherhood barbershop quartet , which was to join the cantor in front of the Ark to lead in the86singing of the En Kelohaynu at the end of the service , he was also concerned about a slight hoarseness he had developed that afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would use the opportunity to dodge into the men 's room to examine his throat in the mirror above the washbowl for signs of redness . Then he would shake some salt from a small packet he had brought from home into a paper cup of warm water and gargle for a few seconds . On the podium two pairs of thronelike chairs , upholstered in rich red velvet , were set on either side of the Ark . The two on the left were reserved for the rabbi and the president of the congregation , while those on the right were customarily occupied by the vice-president and the cantor . At quarter past eight , fifteen minutes before the services were scheduled to begin , only three of the chairs were occupied . Henry Maltzman had not as yet arrived . " I wonder where he is , " Howard Jonas mused . " It does n't look right that he should n't be here . " " He 'll probably be along a little later , " said Herb Mandell . " He was late last week , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ark ? " " Oh no . He slid into a seat in one of the back rows . " " I do n't like it , " said Jonas . " Frankly , I 'm pissed off . It was his idea in the first place , and he rammed it down our throats . So the least he could do is be here and see how it was going . I suppose it 's a business matter that came up , and I 'd be the first to admit that your business comes first . But where he 's president of the congregation , it seems to me that 's like a commitment . Not that , I 'm criticizing , you understand . " " Oh , sure . " Mandell turned to greet an arrival . " Hello Mr. Kalb . Glad you could make it . . . . No , take any seat at all . " Jonas nudged him . " Say , Herb , what 's your arrangement with Maltzman ? You know , about announcing that this is sponsored by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service , he 's supposed to say that he is calling on me for a few words . Then I go up and explain that the Brotherhood is sponsoring the service , and I 'd like to welcomeeverybody . " " Then I think you better go up and take that seat beside the rabbi right now , Herb , because if Henry does n't get here on time , the chances are the rabbi will just start the regular service . " " You think it 's all right ? " " Sure . I 'll hold the fort here by myself . " Diffidently , Herb Mandell walked down the aisle and mounted87the steps of the podium . To the rabbi 's questioning look , he respondedin a whisper , " Howard thought I ought to come up now seeing as Henry Maltzman might not get here in time . " " Of course , " said the rabbi and held out his hand to wish him the traditional Gut Shabbos . " And how is your mother , Mr. Man-dell ? " " Oh , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , " " She seemed to be in good spirits when I saw her yesterday , " said the rabbi . " Oh , well , that 's during the day . It 's in the evening when her asthma seems to act up . Then she gets sort of tired and drowsy . I think maybe it 's from the pills she takes . She has to go to bed right after dinner . If she sleeps through the night , that 's fine . But sometimes she gets up in the middle of the night , and she 's like disoriented . She ca n't catch her breath , and she ca n't find her medicine . It 's kind of frightening . " " Is that so ? And yet she always seems pretty good when I come to visit her . " " Well , it 's during the day , and she 's expecting you , so she gets herself up for it . But we never leave her alone at night . And by the way , Rabbi , do n't think we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The rabbi smiled . " That 's all right . I have her on my list of regulars . " He nodded toward the clock at the rear of the sanctuary . " You planning to say a few words , Mr. Mandell ? " " Oh sure . " With some trepidation , although outwardly resolute , Herb Mandell advanced to the lectern in front of the podium . He waited a moment for the buzz of conversation to stop and then began the little speech he had written and carefully memorized . " As chairman of the committee , I want to welcome you in the name of the temple Brotherhood . " He hoped that those who were here for the first time would enjoy the service and draw spiritual strength and comfort from it . Further he hoped that they would make a habit of it and come every Friday night . Quite at ease now , he even ventured a mild joke not in his prepared text , saying he hoped they would not think it was male chauvinism of the Brotherhood sponsoring only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisterhood . " It is n't that we think we can do the same in one that they do in three . It 's just that we 're new at it , and we want to learn from them . " No one laughed , but he thought he detected a smile or two . Anyway , they would n't be likely to laugh right in the sanctuary , would they ? 88He ended by announcing , " The cantor will now chant the prayer , How goodly are thy tents , O Jacob . " Sitting there on the podium , in full view of the congregation , he felt the responsibility of demonstrating deep interest in the pro- ceedings , so during the chanting he followed the text in the prayerbook , his finger moving along the line as if to make sure that the cantor did not skip a word . From his vantage point he was able to note such interesting phenomena as that Mr. Liston had a facial tic , that Mrs. Eisner whispered almost continuously to the women on either side of her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to preserve his air of great attention . Later , when the rabbi got up to give his sermon , Herb made a point of nodding every now and then in agreement or appreci- ation . Just as the rabbi was bringing his sermon to a close Henry Maltzman arrived , looked around guiltily , and then , an uneasy smile on his face , slid into a seat in the rear . From the podium Herb Mandell frowned in disapproval . He decided that he agreed with Howard Jonas that it was n't right for the president of the congregation to come late to the service . And so late ! It was quar- ter past nine and the service would be over in a few minutes . He found himself watching Maltzman and once their eyes locked . It seemed to him that the president nodded slightly and smiled ap- provingly ? derisively ? He could not be sure . Afterward , in the vestry at the collation , he saw Maltzman several times , moving about among the congregation . Although Maltzman waved to him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mandell thought he might . In fact , it almost seemed as though he were trying to avoid him . Nevertheless , it had been an exhilarating evening for Herb Mandell . When he got home , his first words were , " I wish you could have been there , Molly . Everything went off just right . " " Oh Herb , I 'm so glad for you . " " I 'm sorry you had to stay home with Mother . Maybe we should have tried to get that woman Mrs. Slotnick recom- mended . " " That 's silly . You 'd have to pay her nurse 's rates . " " Yeah . Did Mother give you any trouble ? " " She slept like a baby . And I did n't mind staying home . I had that report to do for the bank . " " How 'd you make out ? " " Oh , I finished it , " she said , motioning toward the desk. 21SATURDAY MORNING , GORE STOPPED OFF AT MOLLY 'S HOUSE BEforegoing to Jordon 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did he say when you gave it to him ? " " I did n't give it to him , " said Molly . " I did n't see him . The house was dark when I got there . " " Why , what time was it ? " " A little after I spoke to you . That was around half past eight . " " He must have gone out . What did you do with the report ? " " I did n't want to leave it in the mail slot . I brought it back withme . That was right , was n't it ? " " Oh , absolutely . I 'll take it up to him now . " She handed him a manila envelope and watched expectantly as he riffled through the typed pages . " Beautiful , " he said . " I really appreciate this , Molly . " " But it does n't balance . " He ran an expert eye down a column of figures . " Here it is , " he announced , pointing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I marked it L rather than AT ' She flipped open the file . " This one ? You want me to make the correction on my typewriter ? I can x it out and  --  " " No , do n't bother . " He made the correction in pencil . " I 'll show it to him to explain what held it up . " From Molly 's he drove directly to Jordon 's house . As he turned in at the gate , he heard an automobile horn , seemingly from the direction of the house . It grew louder as he drove up the driveway , and sure enough , there was a car parked in front of the door . It was Martha , her face contorted with rage as she pushed down on the horn button on the steering wheel . He got out of his car and approached her . " What 's going on ? What 's the matter ? What 's the racket for ? " 90 " Oh , it 's you , Mr. Gore . " Her face relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a month 's wages due me . I knocked on the door and rang the bell but there 's no answer . The old bugger must have seen it was me and wo n't answer out of spite . I 'd like to put a pin in the bell like we used to do when we were kids on Halloween . " " He 's probably gone out . " " No , look at the door . It 's not pulled to . He would n't leave it like that if he were n't in . You can just push it open . " He walked to the door , as she got out of the car to follow him . He stabbed at the bell button . Sure enough , he could hear it ringinginside . " See , the bell is all right . You can hear it , ca n't you ? " He nodded and pushed the button once more . They waited , and she said , " I 'll bet he 's watching and waiting for me to go away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , pushed the door open and stepped in . Martha was right behind him . It took a moment for their eyes to adjust from the bright morning sunlight to the dim light of the room , somber with its curtained and draped windows . It was the buzzing of a large bluebottle fly that drew their eyes to the figure of Ellsworth Jordonlying back in his recliner as though asleep . But there was an ugly wound at the base of the forehead , right between the eyes , from which the blood had trickled down both sides of his nose to the corner of his mouth . Martha screamed . Gore pressed his lips tightly together and managed to repress the urge to retch . " He 's hurt , " she moaned . " The poor man is hurt . Why do n't you do something ? " " Shut up , " he snapped . Without moving , he looked around the room , noting a broken medicine bottle , the fragments of a shatteredlight bulb , the torn canvas of the oil painting of Jordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the police , " he said in a hoarse whisper . " I 'll wait here while you get in your car and drive down to the corner . There 's a pay station there . " " Ca n't you call from here ? " she asked . " Fingerprints , " he replied tersely . " There may be prints on the phone . " As soon as she had gone , he forced himself to approach the figure in the recliner . He touched the icy forehead with his fingertipsand then wiped them on his trouserleg . Suddenly he thought91of Billy and called out , " Billy ? Are you there , Billy ? " He giggled in relief as no answer came . He backed out of the room and left the house , closing the door behind him , but making sure that the lock did not catch . As he went to his car to await the arrival of the police a wild thought occurredto him : that now there was no way of proving who had won the bet he had made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PHOTOGRAPHING , measuring , dusting for fingerprints , the state detective , Sergeant McLure , and a police stenographer were in the kitchen  --  because it had a table to write on  --  questioning Gore . Lanigan and his lieutenant , Eban Jennings , had taken over the dining room as a command post , where they issued orders and received reports from their subordinates . They had just finished questioning Martha Peterson , subdued and teary-eyed , and had sent her on home . " You believe her explanation of the door of the boy 's room being locked ? " asked Jennings . " You believe this Jordon would lock a young man of eighteen in his room like a teacher would send a kid to stand in the corner ? " Lanigan shrugged noncommittally . " Even though he knew the kid would hop out the window ? " " It 's just crazy enough to be true , " said Lanigan . " Maybe Gore might know something about it . We 'll ask him when McLure gets through with him . " " Everything about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you mean ? " " Well , this Jordon is supposed to have been a millionaire . Right ? " " That 's the reputation he had around town . We 'll probably find out more about that , too , from Gore . What about it ? " " Well , does n't this strike you as a funny layout for a million-aire ? " " How do you mean ? " " This dining room now , it 's clean enough , but those drapes are pretty faded and these chairs are kind of wom . Same with the other room . " 93 " I suppose that 's the result of having a housekeeper instead of a wife , " said Lanigan . " A wife is always after her husband to buy new stuff when it gets worn , but a housekeeper will just keep the place clean . " " Yeah . But it 's more than that . Here 's this big ark of a house three stories high , and yet everything is on the first floor . It do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used at all . What was probably the back parlor , he used as his bedroom , right off the living room , mind you . And that little room next to it , that was made into another bedroom for the boy . That looks to me as though he was trying to cut down on his fuel bills . " " Could be , " said Lanigan . " The word was that he was always careful with money . On the other hand , it could be that after he had a heart attack , his doctor might not have wanted him to climb the stairs . And naturally , he 'd want the young fellow right near him in case anything should happen to him in the middle of the night . I wonder where he is . The bed was n't slept in . " " Probably off somewhere for the weekend . Stands to reason he would n't want to spend it hanging around with an old codger like Jordon . This Martha , now , did n't she used to clerk in the super-market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was on the check-out counter . " Jennings nodded in decided agreement . " That 's where I saw her . Nice-looking woman . Yeah , that 's the way I like them , somethingsolid that you can get hold of . I could make something of that girl . " Lanigan 's look was derisive . " Yeah , you 'd like to make a mother of her . That 's what you 'd like . I wonder Maude puts up with you . " " Now , look here , Hugh  --  " " Did you know Celia Johnson ? She used to work for Jordon . She gave up a good job to become his housekeeper . She was a bookkeeper with the Water Commission . Five days a week , nine to five . Paid vacations . Blue Cross and Blue Shield . Pension rights . And she gave it up to go to work for him . Gladys knew her . I remember Gladys explaining to me why Celia did it . She was thirty-eight at the time and not getting any younger . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought maybe she could make him ? Get him to marry her ? " " Sure . Why not ? " 94 " You think that 's why Martha Peterson went to work for him ? " " Well , she 's not getting any younger either . " " It could be that she just likes housework better than clerking , is all . " " Could be , " Lanigan admitted . " But if it 's the way I think , it could be the reason she insisted that Stanley pick her up here was that she wanted to make Jordon a little jealous . Spark him up . Show him there 's some competition . " Jennings showed some interest . " And that 's why she quit her job ? Because she saw it was n't working and there was no sense staying on ? " " Or maybe there was something more between the two than just a job . " Eban Jennings 's pale blue eyes showed interest , and his Adam 's apple bobbled with excitement . " She could have come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even go away , but just kind of hung around outside until she was sure the old man was alone and  --  " Dr. Mokely , the medical examiner , put his head in the doorway and said , " I 've finished here , Hugh . " " Oh , come in , Fred . What 've you got ? " " Death instantaneous , of course . What do you expect from a shot right between the eyes ? " He set his bag down on the floor and took the chair that Jennings pushed at him with his foot . " Powder burns ? " " Suicide ? " He shook his head . " Not a chance . No powder burns . " " Er  --  Doc "  --  Jennings swallowed his Adam 's apple  --  " this Jordonhad a bad heart . " The doctor laughed . " Well , he certainly did n't die of a heart at-tack . " " How do you know ? " Jennings persisted . " Five of the six shots were scattered all over the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Why does it have to have been the last one ? " asked the doctor . " Because it hit him square in the forehead , " said Lanigan . " So the person shooting could see he 'd hit him , and that hitting him there he must have killed him . So would he continue shooting after that ? And if he had n't had a heart attack , would n't Jordon have tried to run or hide if someone started shooting him ? " " How would he get a heart attack ? " asked the doctor. 95 " Say he was asleep , " suggested Jennings . " Would n't the first shot wake him up ? " " I suppose . " " Well , could n't that bring on a heart attack , waking up and seeing someone firing away at him ? " " All right , " the doctor conceded . " So what ? " " Then he could be dead before that last shot that actually hit him , " said Jennings triumphantly . " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the doctor . " And what difference would it make ? It would still be murder , whether he died because he was hit or from fright because somebody was shooting at him . " " Probably no difference , " said Lanigan . " But defense lawyers can come up with some funny angles . Can you prove it one way or the other on the autopsy ? " " I doubt it . If there were a longish time interval between the first shot that could have frightened him into a heart attack and the last one that actually struck him , it might be possible to tell  --  by the amount of bleeding maybe . But by the looks of things , the murderer fired off those shots in rapid succession , like a woman pointing a gun with her eyes closed and firing away until the cylinderwas empty . That would mean only seconds between the first shot and the last , and I doubt if anything would show up on postmortem . As to which shot actually got him . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that recliner and was awakened by the shots . He leans forward to get up and catches one between the eyes , which throws him back again . " " Can you tell from the angle of entry ? " asked Lanigan . " I doubt it , " said the doctor . " The bone would deflect the bulletsome , and we do n't know if he was lying back or sitting up , and at what angle . " " Well , see what you can do . Now , how about time ? " The doctor smiled . " Oh , I can give you that exactly . It was eight-twenty-nine . " " How can  --  " Then the chief smiled , too . " Oh , you mean theclock . But suppose one of those bullets had n't hit the clock ? " The doctor smiled broadly . " Then I 'd say half past eight . " " A comedian ! " Jennings snorted . The doctor grinned . " I 'll give you a spread after I 've done the P.M. " 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's terribly important , Mrs. Small , " said Mrs. Mandell . " I could n't sleep a wink all night . I thought I 'd go out of my mind . " " Could n't it wait until tomorrow ? " " No . No . It must be today . " " Well , he 's at the temple right now for morning services and  --  " " Oh , I understand . Of course . " She even permitted a tinge of sarcasm to enter her voice . " I do n't mean for you to run over and get him out of services , but I wanted to make sure he would come over this afternoon . I mean , I wanted to call him in good time before he makes any other appointments . " " The rabbi does n't make appointments on the Sabbath , Mrs. Mandell . He does n't transact business on the Sabbath , unless it 's an emergency . " " Well , this is an emergency . " " All right , I 'll tell him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing that David had early on established the rule followed by most of his Orthodox colleagues of not answeringthe phone at all on the Sabbath . While the commandment to visit and comfort the sick was enjoinedon all Jews , the congregation expected its rabbi to perform this function for them , quite content to have him gain the credit for the mitzvah . An altruism on their part that Rabbi Small strongly resented . Rabbi Small never tried to convince himself that he enjoyed the pastoral visits to the sick . Because of his natural reserve , he felt he was not very good at it . He found it hard to summon up the forced cheerfulness that the occasion seemed to require , to assure patients they were looking well , when in fact they were not . While able to feel sympathy as they talked about their aches and pains , he always grew restive and suffered considerable embarrassment97when they then went on to enumerate their related complaints  --  against the doctor who was not interested in their case , against the nurse who was negligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . The most trying item on his calendar was his weekly visit to Mrs. Mandell . Unlike the others whom he visited , who were apt to be in bed , or in pajamas and bathrobe if they were able to sit up , she always came down to the living room , fully dressed , her gray hair combed and brushed and tinted a delicate lavender . She was a tall , fleshy woman with a full , round face that showed no trace of illness . When he would remark on how well she looked , she would smile sadly and shake her head . " Now , " she would say , " but you should have seen me last night when I had an attack . I thought it was all up with me . " But this was not one of his regular visits . It was some sort of emergency , she had said . He was more than a little put out when it looked as though the formula of his regular visits was about to be repeated . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " But that 's not unusual for you , you say . Is there some special reason why you had to see me today ? Why it could n't wait until tomorrow ? " " Because tomorrow They would be here . Today They went visitingand wo n't be back until this evening . " From previous visits , he had learned that in her style book , while her son was always My Herbie , his wife was She , and together , husband and wife , were They . C'SOV " Well , I must begin , Rabbi , by admitting that when My Herbie decided to get married , I was opposed . " His lips twitched but he said soberly , " Was your opposition to marriage as an institution , or was it to the girl he chose ? " " Well , I thought he ought to wait a while . " " But he 's a mature man . He 's in his thirties . " " He was thirty-six at the time . He 's thirty-eight now . So having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the right girl came along . I felt that She was not the right girl for him . " Mrs. Mandell shook her head dolefully . " She says She 's thirty , although I think She 's more like thirty-two or thirty-three . That 's already not so young for a woman . My Herbie is tall and handsome . He could have had any number of girls  --  " " But he chose this one , " the rabbi insisted . " Did he , Rabbi ? Or did She choose him ? " 98He smiled . " It comes to the same thing in the end , does n't it ? They 're happy , are n't they ? That 's what matters . " " Oh , I guess She 's happy . " " And he is n't ? " asked the rabbi , smiling . " How can he be ? She 's made a  --  dishrag out of him . Just because he gets home a little earlier , She has him fix the supper and set the table . Afterward , She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominates him completely . And She makes love to him  --  right in front of me . " The rabbi opened his eyes wide . " I mean , She kisses him and fondles him like a kitten . Is that the way for a young married woman to act ? " " It shows she loves him , does n't it ? " " Does it , Rabbi ? Or does it just show She likes men ? " " What are you suggesting , Mrs. Mandell ? " the rabbi asked coldly . But Mrs. Mandell did not feel in the least put out . " Last night , My Herbie had to be at the temple . " " Yes , I know . He was chairman of the committee . " " Now I ca n't be left alone at night . There 's a danger  --  " " Yes , yes , you 've told me . " " So when They have to go off.together , My Herbie arranges for a woman to come and stay with me . " She smirked . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . " Last night She volunteered to stay . She said She had some work to do for the bank . " Her mouth twisted in a superior smile . " What kind of work would a bank ask an employee to do after hours , Rabbi ? And would n't you think a wife would want to watch her husband being honored ? But My Herbie is very trusting . And to tell the truth , I thought nothing of it , either . I went up to bed around eight , as usual , and I dozed off . I never sleep . " " I know . " " About half an hour later , just when the service was starting , I imagine , I was awakened by the phone ringing . She spoke for a couple of minutes and then I heard her coming up the stairs to see if I was asleep , so I pretended . She looked in at me and then tiptoed downstairs . Then She left the house , and I heard her car start up . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think of that ? " The rabbi was nonplussed . " You mean that where she had agreed to sit . . . What did your son say when he came home and found her gone ? " 99 " Oh , She got back before he did . She came back about half an hour later and came up to look in on me again . " " And again you pretended to be asleep ? " " Naturally . My Herbie does n't know unless She told him . And you can be sure She did n't tell him . " " Why are you so sure she did n't ? " " Because he 'd be furious . You see , there 's the danger  --  " " Yes , yes , I know , " he said hastily . " So you can understand why I could n't sleep a wink last night , Rabbi . Why I 've been so upset all day . Where did She go ? Who did She see ? " " Why did she have to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a pack of cigarettes . " " At half past eight ? The stores are closed . And how about the phone call ? " " It could have no relation to her going out . Or it could be some woman friend of hers . " " So She could come over and get a cake recipe , maybe ? No , Rabbi , it was a man who called , and She went to meet him . What shall I do , Rabbi ? What shall I do ? " The rabbi took a deep breath . " I think you told me you had a sister out west  --  " " In Arizona . She has been after me to come out there . " " I think that 's what you should do , Mrs. Mandell . The climate would be good for you . " " And leave My Herbie here trusting , believing , while She betrayshim ? " " Mrs. Mandell , she is not betraying your son . It 's a terrible thing to say about a respectable married woman , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like everyone else , " she said scornfully . " If it does n't concern you personally , sweep it under the rug and make believe it is n't there . " She gave a cunning , calculating look . " But suppose I told you that you are concerned . " " How am I concerned ? " " Because She 's plotting to get you out . What do you think of that ? " she asked spitefully . " I 've heard her on the phone talking to the president , Henry Maltzman , about how they can get rid of you . If I 've heard her once , I 've heard her half a dozen times . Now , what do you think of her ? Now , what do you say ? " " I say you should go out to Arizona to visit your sister , " he said resolutely. 24 " Now SUPPOSE YOU TELL US JUST WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT , " suggested Lanigan genially when Lawrence Gore was seated . " But I told it all to the sergeant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all down in shorthand . " " Well now , that was a statement you were making , " said Lanigan . " Sergeant McLure is a state detective and they have their regulations . But we 're the local police , and we 'd like to hear it , too , not just read what the stenographer types up . " " So you can compare the two statements and badger me if there 's a discrepancy ? " Lanigan smiled . " Something like that . " " All right , " said Gore wearily . " I was invited there for dinner . " " You go there often ? " Jennings asked . " No . Once before , a few months ago . Almost every Thursday night Jordon would go out to the club , the Agathon , and if I were going , I 'd drive him out and back . He did n't like to drive , especiallyat night . But I 'd just drive up to the door and honk the horn and he 'd come out . But yesterday I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver in to the museum  --  I expect you 've heard about that  --  and it was his last chance if he wanted his soup tureen to be exhibited . He told me I could pick it up and invited me to dinner . " Gore went on to tell his story without further interruption . Althoughhe went into considerable detail , he did not mention Molly 's visit to the Jordon house since he did not have personal knowledge of it , and in any case it was after the murder had occurred . It was only after Gore had finished that they questioned him . " When you left , the boy was still in his room ? " asked Lanigan. 101 " Jordon had n't let him out , " Gore answered with a shrug . " Since he got out , he must have let himself out- " " How do you know that ? " asked Jennings quickly . " When I got here this morning , I called out to him . There was no answer . Then I knocked and listened at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not , " said Gore . " That would have meant disturbingevidence , and  --  " Lanigan cut in . " So you figure since he let himself out , he could have got out anytime , maybe even while you were still here talking to the old man . " " He could have , " Gore admitted . " What do you know about him ? " Lanigan asked . Gore spread his hands in a gesture of ignorance . " Not much . Jordon told me he had problems and did n't want him pestered . That 's the way he put it . He did n't specify what kind of problems . He 'd graduated from a secondary school and had no police record , so I hired him . He seemed to be a decent enough kid , but kept pretty much to himself . I do n't know of any friends he had in town . He did his work well , and I liked him . He did n't talk about his family or his background at all . Maybe Jordon told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , he did say once that his father had been killed in the war . Since he was too old to have been born during the Vietnam business and not old enough to have been born during the Korean War , I asked him what war . And he said , the Suez Campaign . Well , that was the action in which England and France joined Israel against Egypt . Of course , his father might have been British or French . But he could also have been Israeli , and knowing how Jordon felt about Jews , I did n't pursue the matter . " " Just how did he feel about Jews ? " asked Lanigan . " I 'm a banker , " said Gore , " and one man 's money is the same as another 's . So I do n't like to talk about religion , and I did n't with Jordon . Once or twice I remonstrated with him when it interfered with business , like when he would n't sell some land that the temple people wanted to buy , or once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . All he said then was that he was n't going to make it any easier for them . I guess he did n't like them . " He smiled . " That did n't prevent him from making a pass at my secretary a couple of times , and he knew she was Jewish . She called him a dirty old man . " 102 " That 's the one you phoned on your way to Boston ? " asked Jennings . " Uh-huh . " " All right . " Lanigan looked up from the notes he had been making . " I guess that about does it . Oh yeah , what about the gun ? " " The gun is one of three that I bought for the bank , one for each teller 's cage , " said Gore . " How come ? " asked Jennings . " I did n't think banks went in for that kind of thing anymore . I thought they relied on an armed guard nowadays . " " That 's right . But we do n't have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use them . " " Then what 's the point in having them ? " " It gives them a feeling of security . If someone comes in and holds up the bank , they 're not supposed to be heroes . But if things should get out of hand , and some wild shooting result . . . " " Why did n't you take it with you when you left ? " asked Lanigan . " Because I do n't have a license to carry a gun . " " How come ? " asked Jennings . " A crackshot like you , and a banker ? " Gore smiled . " For just that reason . I might be inclined to use it , and then be sorry for it afterward . So I eliminate the possibility by not taking out a license . I was planning on calling you people Monday morning so that you could send an officer to pick it up and return it to the bank . " " Too bad you did n't think to call last night as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive today . " 25 " WAS IT ANYTHING SERIOUS ? WAS IT REALLY AN EMERGENCY , David ? " Miriam asked when the rabbi returned . He shook his head . " Just the sick fancies of a lonely and embitteredwoman . " He smiled . " Among other things , she accused her daughter-in-law of plotting against me . You know her at all ? " " Molly Mandell ? Well , I see her when I take your check to the bank on the first of the month , and I see her at Sisterhood meetingsoccasionally . She 's apt to be rather outspoken there , mostly about women 's rights . From little things I 've heard , she 's not one of your more ardent admirers . " She hesitated , and then added , " The Mandells are also supposed to be friendly with the Maltz-mans . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " There 's nothing actually wrong with it , I suppose , but it is curioussince the Maltzmans are so much older than the Mandells . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Well , Henry Maltzman does n't like you , David . I can see it whenever he comes here . Ca n't you sense it ? " " Yes , I 've noticed it . As you pointed out , his attitude was like that of the officers , especially the line officers , when I was a chaplainin the army . And Henry Maltzman is still very much an officer . There was a grudging admission that maybe we in the Chaplain 's Corps might help maintain morale , and hence to that extent we were useful . But otherwise , there was no meeting of minds . I suppose they resented that they could n't give us orders when they outranked us . . I think they felt that way toward the Medical Corps , too . A captain in the Medics once told me that whenever he told an infantry colonel to take his shirt off , he used to wait a minute or two so that the sound of teeth gritting did n't interfere with the sounds he was trying to hear through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more compliantrabbi to deal with . He may even be trying to do something about it . It certainly would n't surprise me . " " And what are you planning to do about it ? " " Nothing , " he said simply . " There 's nothing I can do . " She was annoyed with him . " You mean , you 're giving up ? You 've had trouble with previous residents , and you 've fought them  --  " " It 's different now , " he said . " How is it different ? " she challenged . " Now that they 've got an executive committee of fifteen , it only takes eight votes not to renew my contract . " He smiled ruefully . " Maybe I outsmarted myself when I turned down the lifetime contract . Although if I had a life contract , they could get me out easily enough by voting something that I could n't possibly condone . Still , I 'll admit it 's easier for them now . " " And you would n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Ask the individual members of the board not to fire me ? And what would my position be afterward ? " " So what will you do ? " she asked , her voice betraying exasperation . He smiled faintly . " I suppose this time I 'll have to leave it in the hands of God and hope for the best . " 26 " I HATE THIS KIND OF CASE , " DECLARED STATE DETECTIVE SERgeantMcLure . " It can drag on for months , and we can end up with nothing . Or we might be dead certain we know who did it , and the D.A . will find that we do n't have enough to go to court with . " " What 's so different about this case ? " asked Jennings defensively , as though McLure , from the big city , was casting aspersionson a local product . In any case , the question was rhetorical rather than because he was interested in any answer McLure might give . They were sitting along with Lanigan around the diningroom table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than relaxed , feeling the letdown that followed the tensions and the hectic work of the day . " Well , if it 's a professional job , either we know who had it in for the victim , and then it 's a job of breaking down an alibi  --  because they make damn sure they 've got an alibi  --  or we get someone to talk . You can do pretty good if you 've managed to build up a stable of stoolies . On the other hand , if it 's amateur , then it 's usually a matter of finding out who hated the victim 's guts . But in this case , the victim , as near as I can make out , was a pretty nasty specimen . Any one of the people who were here at the house last night might have wanted to give him the business because he quarreled with every one of them . Not to mention the guy who called him on the phone earlier . Or , for that matter , someone whose name has n't even been mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose that 's true enough , " said Lanigan , " but  --  " " And another thing , " McLure went on , " take the matter of the weapon . Usually , it gives you a lead . Or you have the bullet and when you get it matched up with a particular gun , you 've practi-106cally got your case . But here , the gun was lying on the table in plain sight . So if this Martha came back , or her boyfriend , or this guy that called , or the kid Billy , well , there it was , ready to hand , so to speak . " " Yeah , but on the other hand , there 's the pattern of the shooting , " said Jennings . " The doc said it was like a woman firing away with her eyes closed until the cylinder was empty . I buy that . " " But it could also be a kid who 's crazy about guns , and yet does n't know anything about them , " McLure pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley , " said Jennings with conviction . " He goes up to Maine every year and brings back a deer . " " Yeah , but he 's something of a boozer , I gather . And if he got tanked up first  --  " " What time is it ? " Lanigan asked suddenly . " It 's almost six , " said Jennings . " Why ? " For answer , Lanigan reached for the phone and dialed a number . Into the receiver he said , " Miriam ? It 's Hugh Lanigan . Is David there ? " " He 's at the temple for the evening service . " " Oh , I figured since it was after sundown it was all right to call . " " Well , it is . But that 's when they start the service . It takes about fifteen or twenty minutes . And he 'll be walking home , of course . Shall I have him call you when he comes in ? " " Maybe you can tell me . Did you go to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go every Friday night . " Lanigan signaled to Jennings who lifted the extension and simultaneouslypulled over a pad of paper . " Was Henry Maltzman there ? " " I believe so . Yes , I 'm sure he was . Why ? " " And Stanley Doble ? Was he there ? " " I did n't see him , but I would n't be likely to since he 'd be down in the vestry helping with the preparations for the collation afterward . Why ? Is something the matter ? " " Just routine , Miriam . That 's all . Thanks . " After making note of the time and the date Jennings ripped the sheet off the pad and filed it in the ever-increasing folder of the case . " If the medical examiner confirms the time of the killing as half past eight , that eliminates Henry Maltzman , " said Lanigan . " As I expected , he was at the temple last night . They start at half past107eight . " He squared his shoulders and sat up straight , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to get back to work . " Now , let 's list what we 've got to do . The first thing is to clear away the brush , eliminate the unlikely , so we wo n't waste any time . Besides Maltzman , Gore seems to have a pretty good alibi . He says he stopped at a gas station to make a phone call around that time . He called from the office , so maybe the gas stationattendant remembers . Check with this Mrs. Mandell that he called . She might remember the time . If he 's out of it , then we do n't have to bother about him either . See ? " " Yeah , but Maltzman , he could have gone there earlier and maybe seen something or heard something , " said McLure . " I 'd like to question him . " " Okay , then question him . But he 's a tough monkey . He was a captain in the Marines  --  " " I 've had lots of experience with tough monkeys , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a buck private , so I kind of like to take on officers . " Lanigan winked at his lieutenant and said , " All right , so let 's consider the others . First of all , especially Martha . " Jennings opened the folder and found the notes on their interrogationof her earlier . " She says she left here around seven , and as soon as she got to the street , a bus came along . Got off at MidlandStreet and walked the two blocks to her house . She decided to stay in and made herself some supper . Stanley came by around seven-thirty . She says she did n't admit him . She watched TV and then went to bed around eleven . " " Seems pretty straightforward , " said McLure . " Anything botheringyou about it ? You think she might have come back afterward ? Does she have a car ? " " It was in the garage being worked on . But she could have taken a bus , " said Jennings . " You might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or maybe the neighbors  --  " " What 's bothering me , " said Lanigan , " is the whole setup of Martha as Jordon 's housekeeper . She had a job as a checkout clerk at the supermarket . Seems like an easy job . At least you 're sitting down rather than on your feet all day . It 's forty hours a week , with a paid vacation probably . My guess is it pays about a hundred a week . Now , why would she give that up to become Jordon'shousekeeper ? He was a hard man with a buck , so I doubt if he paid her more than the supermarket . She 'd get here about eight108o'clock and she worked until after the supper dishes were done , which would make it some time after seven . Since she did the cooking , she might have had to come in seven days a week , six anyway . Why would she do it ? Was she fired from the supermarketjob , or did she quit to take the job with Jordon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jennings . Lanigan nodded . " Sure . And she got her meals and her time was pretty much her own during the day . On the other hand , Jordonmay have led her down the garden path by hinting that the job could lead to her becoming Mrs. Jordon . I do n't buy Gore 's explanation that Jordon tolerated her slambanging back at him because he liked independence . To me , it sounds more the way lovers would act . And the whole business with Stanley could have been to spark a little more interest in the old man by making him jealous . And when she handed him her key , that could have been because she realized she did n't have a chance with the old man and the game was over . And after she got home , she could have brooded a bit and then come back to have it out with him , since she knew Billy was going off with Gore and he 'd be alone . The old man had a nasty way of talking , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being amused at the girl realizing she 'd been had . Well , the gun was there and  --  " " Boy , you 're in the wrong part of this business , " said McLure . " You should be an assistant D.A . making your pitch to the jury . You realize you do n't have a single , solitary fact to back up any of this . " " Well , there 's the pattern of the shooting , " said Lanigan . " And there 's the fact that she came back the first thing in the morning and discovered the body . " " Oh , you take that old saw seriously about the criminal being drawn back to the scene of the crime ? " McLure was sarcastic . " I do n't know about any mysterious attraction that the scene of the crime might have for the criminal , but it seems to me that if I had shot a man in the heat of passion the night before and then panicked and run off , I 'd want to come back when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a handkerchief or whatever , that might incriminate me . " " Well  --  " " And remember how we found him , sitting in his recliner . Anybodyelse who came , my guess is he 'd get up and open the door . But when the bell rings and he calls out who is it and finds out it's109Martha , he might say , Come in , the door is open ' and just sit there kind of smiling at her as she jabbered away at him . Anyway , I want you to check her out , Eban . Everything . Start back at the supermarket . Did she see much of Jordon while she was still working there ? Was there gossip ? Was there someone she confided in ? Understand ? " " How about this Stanley guy ? " asked McLure . " Now he threatenedhim , according to Gore . " " We 've got to pick him up , of course . And  --  " " No , we do n't , Hugh , " said Jennings . " We 've got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else a little while ago and they told me . They found him on Fairbanks Street fast asleep in his car , drunk as a skunk . One of the residents notified the police and they took him in . He 's sleeping it off in a cell right now . " " Good . So that leaves only the young fellow , Billy . " " Put out an all points on him ? " " Let 's see if we can get it on the early evening news . Make it plain that he 's not a suspect , just that we 're interested in information that he might give . " Jennings wrote in his notebook and then looked up inquiringly . " Anything else , Hugh ? " " Yeah , go on home and get yourself a decent meal . I 'll see you at the stationhouse afterward. " 27SINCE RABBI SMALL DID NOT TURN ON EITHER THE RADIO OR TVon the Sabbath , it was not until he arrived at the temple for the evening service that he heard about the murder . The dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot less observant of the Sabbath than the rabbi and hence knew all about it . Most of them were listening to Julius Rottenberg who was a maven , that is , an expert in matters criminological by virtue of operating a coffee shop just outside the law courts in the neighboring city of Lynn , and who , therefore , was on intimate terms with the district attorney ( " coffee and a cruller and heavy on the cream " ) , the assistant D.A . ' s , all the cops and even the presiding judge ( " tea with lemon and a little extra hot water , Julius " ) . " It 's the kid , of course , " he was saying when the rabbi entered the chapel where they were waiting to begin the service . Fat and bald and normally with a perpetual , eager smile , Julius now showed a fine high scorn for someone who had suggested that it could be some stranger from his past who had shot Ellsworth Jordon . " Nah , " he said with an impatient sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gives them an out . See ? But it was the kid that did it . He 's crazy about guns . All kids are . What do you expect with all these westerns on the tube , and the gang pictures , too . He pinches the gun out of the bank where he works . To hold up somebody , or even to fire it in the woods ? Nah . Just to fondle it . To practice a quick draw , maybe , or twirling it around his finger , like the gunmen do in the westerns . So the old man catches him with it and makes him put it down and sends him to his room . Then everybody leaves  --  there was some sort of dinner party  --  and the old man sits down in his easy chair to grab himself forty winks . " So they 're all alone , and the old man is asleep . So the kid leaves his room to get another look at the gun , to hold it and wave it around . And it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , so he figures he might as well get hanged for a sheep as for a lamb , so he fires away until the gun is empty . And when he 's finished , EllsworthJordon is dead . " " Yeah , but why did n't Jordon jump up and stop him , Julius ? " Julius nodded with pompous solemnity . " Good question . My theory is that the old man panicked and froze . " A new arrival announced , " Hey , guys , I just heard that the cops arrested Stanley . " " Stanley ? Our Stanley ? What for ? " " I do n't know . All I heard was he was arrested . Did you see him around today ? " " He was n't here last night either . Look in the vestry and you 'll see all the stuff from the collation , the dirty dishes , they 're still on the table . " " You think we ought to clean up ? " " That 's the House Committee 's business . " Throughout the service the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He performed perfunctorily even the Havdala ceremony that divided the Sabbath from the rest of the week . What kept running through his head was that if Jordon was dead , and if Henry Maltzman had been right about him , then the temple might now be able to buy the adjoining land for the religiousschool . A little ashamed of his thoughts and his inability to concentrate on the prayers , the rabbi did not stand around and talk with the members of the minyan at the conclusion of the service as he usuallydid , but excused himself and went right home . He had no sooner entered the house , when the phone rang . " Rabbi Small , " he announced . From the other end came a hoarse chuckle . " I figured you 'd be getting home right about now , Rabbi . " " Stanley ? " " That 's right . I 'm down at the stationhouse , and they said I could make a phone call . " " You mean you 've been arrested ? What for ? What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little drunk . " " All right . I 'll be down and talk with them . " 28THE DESK SERGEANT LOOKED AT RABBI SMALL DOUBTFULLY AND said , " Gee , I do n't know , Rabbi . You 're not a lawyer , are you ? I mean , you do n't have a law degree , do you ? " " No  --  " " Because he 's got a right to see his lawyer , of course , but I do n't know about anybody else . I guess it would be all right if you were his spiritual advisor , but Stanley not being Jewish , his spiritualadvisor would have to be a minister or a priest depending on if he was Catholic or Protestant . See what I mean ? I mean just because he works at your temple would n't make you his spiritual advisor , and your not being a lawyer . . . " He chewed at his lower lip in vexation . " He said he wanted to make a call , so I figured he was going to call his lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeantwas annoyed , as though Stanley had taken advantage of his trusting nature to deceive him . " Why do n't you ask Chief Lanigan if it 's all right ? " suggested the rabbi . " He 's pretty busy . Well . . " He came to a decision and left his desk to walk down the short hall and rap on the door of the chief 's office . Lanigan opened the door and saw the rabbi . Withoutwaiting for an explanation from the sergeant , he said , " Hello , Rabbi . What brings you down here ? You want to see me ? Come on in . " The rabbi nodded to Lieutenant Jennings and took the seat proffered him . " I got a call from Stanley , Stanley Doble  --  " " Oh , it was you he called . You want to see him ? " The rabbi laughed shortly . " It 's he who evidently wants to see me . I gather he 's been arrested . Could you tell me what for ? " The phone rang and Lanigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on . " He cupped the receiver and said to Jennings , " Another Billy call . " Jennings said , " That 's number seven . " " This is Chief Lanigan , " he said into the instrument , and reached for a scratch pad . " What 's the name again ? . . . How do you spell that ? Two e 's ? . . Okay , Mr. Beech . . . This motel is where ? Where are you calling from ? . . . North Adams ? . . . Uh-huh . . . Uh-huh . . . All right , and what did he look like ? How tall would you say he is ? . . . Five foot four ? No , the man we 're looking for is quite a bit taller . Close to six feet . . . No , I do n't think that 's anything you can disguise , but thanks for calling . We appreciate it . Bye . " To Jennings he said , " A motel operator from North Adams . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beech thought he hesitated before writing the e . " " North Adams is the other end of the state . If the kid does n't show up pretty soon , we 'll be getting calls from Texas and California , " said Jennings . " Even if he does show up , " said Lanigan . He brought a large , fleshy hand down across his broad face , as if to wipe out the lines of worry and tiredness . To the rabbi he said , " We 've been at it since the first thing this morning . I had a sandwich for lunch and not much more for dinner . Gladys did n't expect me home . And ten cups of coffee in paper cups . The news broadcast was an hour ago , and we 've had seven calls from people saying they saw him . You sure it was seven , Eban ? Seems like more . " " Yeah , seven . I 've been keeping count . " " Plus other calls from people who had all kinds of suggestions and advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would n't give his name but was sure that we were persecuting an innocent man . We 'll get a lot more of those before this is over . All that , in addition to the legitimate calls  --  from my own people on things and asking for additional instructions , calls from the D.A .  --  " He smiled broadly . " The hell with it . What can I do for you , Rabbi ? " " I came about Stanley . Remember ? Am I to infer that his being here is because he 's mixed up in this murder in some way ? " " Stanley . Right . Well , Jordon was shot around half past eight . About an hour before that , Stanley had a row with him at his house . He was finally pushed out , but he threatened to come back . " " And that 's why you arrested him ? " Lanigan grinned broadly . " Not really . The boys found him sit-114ting in his parked car dead drunk and pulled him in to sleep it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now , has n't he ? " " Yes , but there are some questions we 'd like to ask him . " " Then how about asking him the questions and letting him go ? He 's got a job to do . " Lanigan pressed his lips together as he considered . " All right . " He spoke into the phone to ask the desk sergeant to have Stanley sent up . " But do n't you say anything while I 'm questioning him . " " Of course not , " said the rabbi . There was a discreet knock on the door , and the sergeant and a uniformed patrolman marched a woebegone , disheveled Stanley into the room . When the officers had been dismissed , Lanigan said , " Now , Stanley , I want you to tell me everything that happenedwhen you came back to Jordon 's house last night . " " What do you mean , came back ? " demanded Stanley truculently . " I never came back there . I would n't set foot in his lousy house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then suppose you tell us what you did when you left Jordon 's . You did go to see him , did n't you ? " " I did like hell . I got no business with him . I went to pick up Martha Peterson which I had a date with her . And they said she was n't there , that she was waiting for me down by the gate . So why did n't I see her when I turned into the driveway ? Or if I missed her on account I was looking out to clear the gatepost , would n't she have seen me ? And would n't she have yelled out ? But , of course , she could 've walked a little away from the gate , so I went back down there . And she war n't there . So then I had to figure out was they lying to me , or did she put them up to it on accountshe changed her mind and did n't want to see me . " " So what did you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of beers . " " To help you decide , I suppose , " said Jennings sarcastically . " That 's right . And it came to me maybe she 'd gone home even before I got there . So I went over to her place , and she was there . " He looked triumphantly from one to another of the three men in the room . " Then what did you do ? " asked Lanigan . " Well , she would n't let me in , and she would n't go out . We were talking like through the door . She had it on the chain , see . But she as much as told me she 'd lost her job on account of me. 115So I thought maybe I 'd go back to Jordon 's and have it out with him . " " And what time was that ? " asked Lanigan casually . " Oh , eight , eight-thirty , maybe even a little later . See , I thought I 'd have another beer first . Well , I came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a left into his driveway , and then I noticed the place was dark . Not that the place is ever really lit up any time I 've gone by there . Never enough light to draw mosquitoes . The old skinflint would n't spend the money . But this time , it was dark like he 'd gone out or gone to bed . And then while I was trying to figure was he maybe in bed , and should I ring or bang on the door so he 'd have to get up at least to answer , this car comes tootling along from the other direction and curves into the driveway . So I thought , what the hell , there 's no use my going up there where he was having company . So I just went on away from there over to Salem to visit another ladyfriend of mine I got there . " " This friend have a name ? " asked Lanigan . For the first time , Stanley showed reluctance . He glanced at the rabbi uncertainly . Finally , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We always call her Frenchy , on account of she 's what you might call of French extraction . " " This car you saw going into the driveway , what make was it ? " asked Lanigan negligently , as though it had no interest for him and he was merely making conversation . Stanley shook his head . " He was coming toward me and he had his high beams on . " " And this was what time ? " " Like I said , it could 've been half past eight , or maybe a little later . " The phone rang , and as soon as Lanigan announced himself , an excited voice came from the other end . " Chief , the young fellow , Green , has just showed . Caught him trying to climb through the window in back . " Both Lanigan and Jennings immediately became alert . Lanigan said , " All right , beat it , will you , Rabbi . I 'm going to be busy for a while . " " How about Stanley ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WENT ON FOR HOURS . WHEN LANIGAN AND JENningsarrived at the Jordon house , McLure was already there and had already begun the interrogation , and Billy was sobbing and blubbering . McLure broke off long enough to nod the two men over to a far corner to get them current with the situation . " He pretends he did n't know about the murder until he got here , " he said , " but I 'm sure he 's the one , and it 's only a question of time before I get him to admit it . " " You ever hear of Miranda ? " asked Lanigan coldly . Instantly McLure was wide-eyed innocence . " I have n't accused him , I 'm just questioning him as a witness  --  just for information . " " Then why 's he crying ? " " He feels bad about the death of Jordon  --  he says . " " What was Jordon to him ? Did he say ? " " Says he was just a friend of his mother 's . " McLure 's eyes sparkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is ? Hester Grimes . She 's his mother . " " Who 's Hester Grimes ? " asked Jennings . " Oh , you must have seen her on TV . She 's a nightclub singerand entertainer . You see her on a lot of these talk shows . " " Where is she ? " asked Lanigan . " How do we get in touch withher ? " " She 's on tour in Europe . What I got out of him so far is  --  " " Never mind . I 'll talk to him myself . If he changes his story , you can question him , but otherwise I 'd appreciate it if you justsat quiet . " Lanigan went over to the boy and sat down beside him . " I 'm Chief Lanigan of the police department here , Billy . " " Yeah . I 've seen you around . " " I 'd like you to tell me what happened , " Lanigan went on. 117 " This terrible thing that happened last night , we 've got to investigateit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Now , Mr. Jordon was killed with the gun that you brought home . Suppose you tell me about that . Did Mr. Gore ask you to take the gun with you ? " " Oh no . He asked me if I 'd care to ride shotgun while he took the Peter Archer silver into Boston , but I knew he only meant that I 'd be riding beside him . But I thought , what if someone  --  well , you know , that stuff is pretty valuable , and what could I do ? I mean , I 'm not one of these big , hefty guys . And Mr. Gore is n't either . So I thought , if we should get stopped  --  well , I did n't know about the special law here in Massachusetts . I knew you had to have a license , but I figured Mr. Gore must have one , since he 's president of the bank and is into handgun shooting and all , and I 'd be with him all the time . And , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back and who 'd know . " Lanigan did not badger him and he did not try to confuse him , but he was persistent . " Well , how soon after you were locked in did you leave ? " " Oh , right away . " " How right away ? " For the first time , Billy grinned . " Well , when he said he was locking me in , I thought , Oh yeah ? and I headed for the window . " " All right . And where 'd you go ? " " I went away from there as fast as I could . I went down the back driveway that we do n't use anymore , out to Elm Street . " " Why did you go down there ? Were you afraid you might be seen if you went down the regular driveway ? " " That 's right . I thought Mr. Gore might be coming out , and I did n't want to see him . " " Why not ? " " Well , it was embarrassing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked me in my room before , and I 'd always sneaked out . I did n't mind that . It was like a game we played . See , that was his way of telling me I 'd done something wrong . It never bothered me much . I 'd just sneak out . And he knew it . It was like a game between the two of us . But he should n't have done it in front of Mr. Gore . See , Mr. Gore is my boss , and he 's like a friend to me . And here Mr. Jordon was treating me like a little kid . It was awfully embarrassing , so I did n't want to see Mr. Gore . I 'd be118  --  well  --  embarrassed . And I was wondering if I could even go back to the bank . " " So then what did you do ? " " Well , I did n't know what to do , because I sure was n't going to come back until late , maybe not till midnight . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing to do there anyway . So there 's a bunch of people waiting for a bus , and just then it came along , so I got on it . " " Anybody you recognized on the bus ? " asked Lanigan casually . Billy shook his head . " No , I did n't see anybody I knew . " " I should think being a teller at the bank you 'd recognize a lot of people , " suggested Jennings . " And even if you did n't know them , they 'd know you and maybe say hello . " Billy shook his head again . " We 're in North Barnard 's Crossing . Down this end of town everybody banks at the Deposit and Trust . " " What were you planning on doing in Boston ? " asked Lanigan . Billy shrugged his shoulders . " Just hang around and then take a late bus back . But I got to thinking . Mr. Jordon played me a dirty trick , so maybe I could pay him back one . So when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and took a bus to New York . See , I figured he 'd know if I did n't get back that night , and he 'd get worried , and it would serve him right . " " I guess you did n't like him very much , " suggested McLure . Billy looked surprised . " Sure I liked him . Why would n't I like him ? " His eyes began to tear . " He 'd bring me stuff , you know , presents , whenever he came to visit us , from the time I was a little kid . And he invited me to stay with him , did n't he ? I remember once , when I 'd been here maybe a couple of weeks , I got sick . It was this twenty-four-hour bug . But Mr. Jordon kept coming into my room practically all night to see how I was . " " All right , " said Lanigan , " let 's get back to your travels . I do n't suppose you met anyone you knew on the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What bus was it , by the way ? " " It was a Greyhound . I took the nine o'clock . They leave every hour . Actually , it was eight-fifty-five . " " What did you do in New York ? " asked Jennings . " Well , it was pretty late when I got in , or rather pretty early in the morning . So I had a bite in the terminal , and then I thought maybe I 'd go home . But then I thought the doorman would ask me all kinds of questions . We 're kind of friendly , me and the119doorman . So then I thought maybe I 'd hang around the city , or go to one of those all-night movies in Times Square . See , if I went to my house in the morning , or during the day , it would n't be so , you know , funny , and the doorman who is on days I 'm not so friendly with , so he would n't be apt to ask me any questions . But I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to be a bunch of drunks in those places . So I did n't know what to do , and just sitting there in the terminal trying to make up my mind , I fell asleep . " " I should think you would have slept on the bus , " said Jennings . " I always do . " " I tried but could n't , " said the young man . " I was like upset . Maybe I did doze off and on . But later in the terminal building , I passed right out . When I woke up , it was morning , and I was stiff and felt kind of grubby . So I washed in the men 's room and I bought a comb at one of the stores in the terminal "  --  he fished in his jacket pocket and brought forth a comb  --  " see , here it is , Souvenirof New York , it says . Then I had some breakfast . And then I took a bus downtown and just walked around . " " Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see , I started worrying about Mr. Jordon . I thought he 'd be terribly upset wondering what had happened to me if he found out I had n't come home to sleep . And what with him having a weak heart and all . So I went back to the terminal and took a bus back to Boston . Then I took a bus back to Barnard 's Crossing , and I got off at the Elm Street stop , the same as where I had taken the bus when I left . It was pretty dark by then , so I came up the back way , planning on sneaking into my room . But when I got to the house , I could see something was n't right . The door of my room was open and I could see into the living room . And then I saw a cop  --  er  --  policeman , and I knew something was wrong . I thought maybe Mr. Jordon had called the police when he 'd found I was n't there . And my window was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push the latch over , a policeman nabbed me . And then I found out what happened . And I 've been thinking that if I had n't sneaked out , then nothing might have happened . " They continued to question him , but at eleven , Lanigan called a halt . The three men retired to a far corner of the room and discussed the story in low voices . " It seems pretty straightforward , " said Lanigan , " but , of course , he may be lying . " " He 's had plenty of time to work up a story and get it down pat , " was McLure 's comment. 120 " We could question the driver of the Boston bus , " Jennings suggested . " Oh sure , " said Lanigan . " We 'll get a picture of him , and if the bus driver does n't remember him , he may know some of the people who take that bus regularly , and they might remember him . Also , the driver of the New York bus , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the drivers of the later buses , " said McLure . " I 'm betting he took the ten o'clock bus to New York , or even eleven . I 've seen it again and again . A guy does something that wo n't bear thinking about . So he blanks it out of his mind , but he adjusts his story just enough so as to make it impossible . Get it ? By saying he took the nine o'clock , it means he could n't have killed the old man at half past eight . And he keeps the rest of the story the same , so he does n't have any trouble remembering any lies . " Lanigan looked at him curiously . " You 're pretty sure he did it ? " " Common . You can see he 's a jerky sort of kid that everybody steps on . Take this business of being sent to his room . Is that the way you discipline the average eighteen-year-old ? Would any other kid stand for it ? Or , for that matter , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to live with an old man so his ma can be free to go gallivanting around Europe ? Okay . His boss feels sorry for him and invites him to go in town with him . That kind of kid is crazy about guns . It gives him a sense of power . Now the old man shames him in front of the boss by sending him to his room . So when Gore leaves and the old man dozes off , he climbs out of the window . But he does n't go down to get a bus . Oh no , he sneaks around to the front of the house and comes in . And there 's the gun on the table . He has this urge just to hold it . My guess is he picks it up and just kind of fondles it , and it goes off . Maybe he shoots out the light , and the place goes dark . Then the kid knows he 's in trouble , and he panics and just goes on shooting . And when he comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he runs  --  to Boston and then to New York . " " And why does he come back then ? " asked Lanigan . " Like I said , because he 's wiped it clean out of his mind . You might have to get a psychiatrist to hypnotize him and bring it back . " " What are you going to do with him tonight , Hugh ? " asked Jennings . " He ca n't sleep here . " " Well , for tonight I figured we 'd put him up at the stationhouse121in one of the cells . If we get him a place at a hotel , I 'm not sure the town would stand for the expense , and he 'll be pestered by all kinds of people as soon as the news is out . " " He will anyway when he goes back to work at the bank on Monday , " Jennings pointed out . " Yeah , unless  --  unless  --  say , is Tom Hegerty on the island now , Eban ? " " Ever since Labor Day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know he 'd like a helper . " " That 's even better . Let 's see what we can arrange . " He approached the young man and said , " Look , Billy , you ca n't sleep here because we 're still working here . It 's pretty late to get you a hotel room , so how would you like to sleep down at the sta-tionhouse ? " " Oh sure . I do n't want to put you to any trouble . " " Fine . So that 's settled . Now , I 'd like you to stay around town for the next few days , but I do n't think you ought to go back to the bank just yet . " " Gosh , no . I bet people would be coming up to my window just to look at me like I was some kind of freak . " " That 's what bothers me , too , " said Lanigan . " So I got an idea . Do you know Children 's Island in the harbor ? " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ? I 've never been there . " " Well , Tom Hegerty lives out there , getting the place ready for the winter . How would you like to work there with him as a helper , painting , rough carpentry  --  " " Gee , I 've never done anything like that . " " You do n't have to know anything , " Lanigan assured him . " Most of the time you just hand him things or hold them while he works on them or fetch them for him . " " If I can do it , I would n't mind . It might be kind of fun living on an island . " " Fine . Then it 's settled . I 'll arrange it . " He rejoined the other two and nodded to indicate his satisfaction . " How about Miranda now ? " sneered MeLure . Lanigan looked at him in surprise . " What 's Miranda got to do with it ? All I did was arrange for a job for the young man . " 30WHEN HERB MANDELL RETURNED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found Henry Maltzman sitting on the sofa in the living room , Molly beside him , their heads close together as they pored over a sheet of paper spread out on the coffee table in front of them . His entrance momentarilystartled them , and they sprang apart . " Oh , hi there , Herb . " Maltzman waved to him . " I thought since it 's your first board meeting , we 'd drive down together , your car or mine , and I could fill you in . " He gestured to the paper on the coffee table . " I 've been going over the list with Molly . We 've got five I 'm sure of , three probables and a couple or three possi-bles . " " I think Mrs. Melnick is another possible , " said Molly , " and I think you can list Mrs. Kaufman as a probable . " " It 's still not enough to take a chance on , " said Maltzman . " I want a straight up-and-down vote without discussion . The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 'll give us time to contactthe probables  --  " " I 'll talk to Anne Kaufman , " Molly volunteered . " I 'm sure I can get her to go along . " " Swell . And I 'll sound out Joe Krasker and Harvey Gorin . If we get all three , that will give us eight , and we 're in like Flynn . " He had risen , and taking Herb by the arm , he said , " Now , here 's what I want you to do , Herb . . . . " Maltzman drove  --  and talked . Herb wanted to make his own position clear on the matter of the rabbi 's ouster , but each time he made the attempt , Maltzman said , " Listen , will you . " The tone was not peremptory ; it was even kindly , but Herb was restive , feeling that he was being treated like a youngster . Once they had arrived at the temple , however , Maltzman's123manner changed . With his arm around Herb 's shoulder , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the basement corridor , and introducing him to those whom he did not know jovially assured them , " Herb is a corner and he 'll add some weight to this board . " The group moved down the corridor past the classrooms of the religious school to the directors ' room at the end . It was a small room . Like the classrooms , it had beige plaster walls and a low ceiling . Along one side , high up on the wall and hinged on top so that they could be swung inward , was a row of small windows level with the ground outside . Above the windows ran the asbestos-covered pipes for heating the building . It differed from the classrooms only in that , instead of pupils ' desks , it had a long oblong mahogany table surrounded by small bridge chairs that took up most of the room , except for a small space at the end near the door , where there stood a blackboard on wooden uprights . They shuffled to places around the table , while Maltzman remainedstanding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the murder while awaiting Maltzman 's arrival , and they continued after taking their places around the table . " It must have been the boy , " said Harvey Gorin . He ticked off points on his fingers . " He was the last one in the house . He ran off  --  " " But he came back . " " They always return to the scene . " " Did he come back , or was he brought back ? That 's what I 'd like to know . " Maltzman rapped on the table . " Let 's come to order and get this meeting started . Who killed Ellsworth Jordon is the business of the police  --  " Doris Melnick , who had been a high school civics teacher , said reprovingly , " Murder is the concern of every citizen , Henry . " " Oh yeah ? Well , count me out on this one . This Jordon was the biggest anti-Semite in town , and whoever did it deserves a medal . " " How do you know , Henry ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have dealings with him , Henry ? " " If it 's true , " said Mrs. Melnick , " I do n't think it 's wise for you to go around saying so . " " Why not ? " demanded Maltzman. 124 " Because it 's apt to cause bad feeling in town for all of us , and it may suggest to the police that they ought to investigate us . " " Let ' em . We 've got nothing to hide . Now let 's get this meeting started . If you want to talk about murder , then I 'll just walk out because I 've got better things to do . " He looked around the room . They were restive , but remained silent . He rapped sharply on the table with his knuckles and announced , " All right , this meeting is now called to order . Before we begin with the regular business , I 'd like to say a few words . When I announced last meeting that I was appointing Herb Mandellto fill the vacancy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the new regulations that permit the president to do so , I did not ask Herb first . I did n't ask him if he wanted to serve on the board . I just told him that I had appointed him and I expected him to serve . Why ? I 'll tell you . Because Herb Mandell is that sort of guy . You tell Herb there 's a job that has to be done and you want him to do it , and Herb 's answer is Okay . ' And that 's the kind of guy we need on the board . And that 's why I did n't let any grass grow under my feet when Joe Cohen resigned . All right . Now , let 's go ahead with the meeting . The secretarywill read the minutes . " Herb Mandell listened intently to the reading of the minutes , to the reports of the committee chairmen , to the questions and objectionsraised on the reports . He would have liked to take part in the discussions , if only to justify the reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and dealt with matters about which he knew nothing . Finally , Maltzman announced , " Unless there are any strong objections , I 'd like to dispense with any further business and go on to a consideration of the budget . All right ? Mike , it 's all yours . " Meyer Andaman , chairman of the budget committee , ducked down and retrieved a dispatch case that he had kept on the floor between his feet . " Although we discussed certain items last meeting , and had a look at all the items , I thought it would be a good idea to get it all down in black and white . So I had my girl run off Xeroxes so that you could each have one in front of you as we talk about each item . I 'll pass these along so you can follow each and every item as we talk about it . Now , I suggest that we kind of dispense with the rules , and if you got anything to say as we discusseach and every item , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents ' worth . Take a minute now to look over these sheets , 125and then we 'll start with item number one and go through each and every item . " It was Herb Mandell 's cue . " Mr. Chairman , I 'd like to make a suggestion . Since we have this all in black and white , why ca n't we postpone action on the budget for a week so we can take these home and go over them carefully in the privacy of our own homes ? " Meyer Andelman said , " I 'd like to talk to that , Mr. Chairman . It 's like this , Herb . This is the first of the month , or the Sunday that 's nearest the first . And we always pass the budget on the first of November . " Maltzman cleared his throat . " Well . . . " " Is it in the bylaws that we have to ? " asked Mandell . " No , it 's not in the bylaws , " Andelman admitted , " but we always do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not in the bylaws , why do n't we hold it over so we can do a thorough job now that we have it all down in black and white ? " " But a lot of this we went over last week , " said Andelman . " Well , I was n't here last week . " " Well , sure , I realize that , Herb , but any item that you ca n't make up your mind on , you could abstain . Personally , I do n't think your vote is going to be all that necessary . I mean , it 's my opinion that we 're not likely to have any item where the vote is going to be that close where one vote will make a difference . See what I mean ? " " Sure , I understand your point of view , Meyer , " said Mandell , " but maybe I can make you see my point of view . It 's like a matter of principle with me . See , I 'm an accountant . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of financial statement and be told to approve it before I 've had a chance to look it over and study it . That 's my training in me , see ? Now , you can say that I can abstain . But as long as I 'm an official member of this board , I feel like I 've got a kind of responsibility to participateon financial-type matters . Maybe I 'm wrong , but that 's the way I feel . " " Aw , let 's put it over , Mike , " someone called out . " Sure , what 's the point of hassling . Herb would like another week to look it over , so why not ? I think maybe I 'd like a little more time on it . " " What difference does it make , this week or next ? " 126Andelman looked around uncertainly . " Well , if that 's the pleasure of this body . . . " Maltzman quickly put it to a vote . " All those in favor of puttingoff consideration of the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay . The Ayes have it . " When the meeting was adjourned shortly afterward , Maltzman signaled Mandell to wait for him . When the others had gone down the corridor out to the parking lot leaving the two alone in the room , Maltzman said , " I just wanted to tell you , Herb , that you did that absolutely perfect . That idea of yours , explaining how it was against your principles as an accountant , that was "  --  he searched his mind for the right word  --  " that was sheer genius . And you see now why I wanted you to do it . If it had been one of the guys who 's associated with me , the other side would have smelled a rat . This way , nothing . " He winked and punched him playfully on the arm. 31WHEN THE CALL CAME IN MONDAY MORNING , LANIGAN 'S FIRST INclinationhad been to send someone , Jennings or McLure , or even Sergeant Holcombe . But the weather was fine , a cool early Novemberday , and it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , more particularly , some time away from the office , even though it meant going home to change from his uniformto civilian clothes , which he considered more appropriate when he went outside his jurisdiction . When he entered the lobby , the office building automatically registered in his mind as second-rate . It was an old building that had been spruced up with a new self-service elevator and fake plastic mahogany paneling . The renovation did not extend to the upper floors , however . The corridors there were covered with worn linoleum tile of brown and yellow , which clashed with the bilious lime green of the walls . The office of Charles Sawyer , Attorney , was in keeping with the rest of the building . There was the same brown-and-yellow tile on the floor and the same lime-green walls . It was a small room with a single window facing another office building . Ranged along one wall were several chairs and a small round oak table on which were a number of old law journals . Seated at a small desk was a pleasant-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up inquiringly when Lanigan entered . " I 'm Chief Lanigan of the  --  " " Oh yes . " And jerking her head toward a door beside her that was ajar , she said , " Go right in . He 's not doing anything . " The inner office was somewhat larger , but also with one window . Against one wall there was a glassed-in bookcase with law books , and with files and papers and corporation seals on the lower shelves . A single visitor 's chair stood in front of a large128green metal desk . Lanigan assumed that when there was more than one client present , either the others had to stand or chairs were brought in from the outer office . Behind the desk , his fingers laced over his belly , teetering back and forth in his swivel chair , was Charles Sawyer , a smiley man with a round head and small ears flattened against it as though stitched in place . His hair was gray and sparse . " I 'm Chief Lanigan of the Barnard 's Crossing Police and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why sure . " Lanigan reached for his wallet and flipped it open to show his badge . The little smile , which Lanigan decided was merely the way he held his mouth , broadened to show a real smile . " I have to be careful when it 's criminal business , " he said . " I once had a reportertry to pass himself off as one of the D.A . ' s men . " He raised his voice and called out , " Emily , when was it that reporter tried to bamboozle me ? " " Two years ago . The Blatz case , " came the answer from the other room . Lanigan turned and saw that the door , which he had closed behind him on entering , had opened of itself and was standing ajar again . " I do n't get much criminal business , " Sawyer informed him , " but I get some , and I 've learned to be careful . " He smiled again . " That 's what you go to a lawyer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner who knows how to be careful ? " " I guess so . Were you Ellsworth Jordon 's lawyer ? " " Oh , off and on , now and again . " He got up and circled his desk and closed the door , pushing it with his shoulder and turning the knob at the same time . This time it remained closed , and he came back to his place behind the desk . " I 've complained to the management about that door , but you know how service is these days . " Lanigan smiled sympathetically . " Not that I mind if Emily hears what we 're saying . She knows everything that happens in this office . But someone else might come in while we 're talking , another client . . . " " Of course . " " I was away for the weekend  --  a little trip  --  so I did n't hear about Jordon until last night when there was that item about William Green . I try to cooperate with the police as much as I can . Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar I 'm an officer of the court . But there did n't seem to be any sense in129calling last night after eleven . I figured this morning would be soon enough . " " Oh , that 's all right , " Lanigan assured him . " Then that 's settled . Now to business . " He rubbed his hands briskly . " Ellsworth Jordon came to see me a couple of months ago and asked me to draw up a will for him . Now while Ellsworth was meticulous about money and would n't take a dime that did n't belong to him , he also had a strong sense of meum and tuum . And in this matter the tuum was the government , federal and state . " His little smile broadened again to show he was amused . " Quite indignant he was about inheritance taxes . He could n't see why he should have to pay inheritance taxes where he 'd already paid incometaxes on the money when he earned it . And he wanted me to work out some plan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a minimum , eliminating it altogether if possible . I suggested he might do better with a tax lawyer , but he insisted I do it , even if it involved my engaging the services of a specialist . So I proceeded on that basis . It involved considerable work on my part . There were various suggestions that I made that he took exceptionto . But finally I got in everything he wanted , or at least had been induced to accept . " " And who was the beneficiary ? " " Why , that 's why I called you . It was that same young man , William Green , Ellsworth 's natural son . He was leaving it all to him . " Lanigan nodded slowly . " It explains Jordon inviting him to come and live with him . And yet when I questioned him the other night , he said Jordon was just an old friend of the family . " " The young man may very well think so , " Sawyer said . " Jordonwas sure he did not know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . His smile expanded until it seemed to extend from ear to ear . There was even a gurgle , which Lanigan interpreted as laughter . " No , he gets nothing . Not a dime . My guess is it will all go to the commonwealth . " " But why not ? Is there something wrong with the will ? " asked Lanigan bewildered . " There is no will . There is only my draft of the will . I sent it to Jordon a few days ago , and he sent it back with some suggestions for changes penciled in the margin . I got it Friday morning . It was never signed . " This time he laughed out loud . " The best laid plans of mice and men , you know . " 130Lanigan looked at him curiously , wondering why he should take such pleasure in Jordon 's plans having been thwarted . " You 've known Jordon a long time ? " he asked tentatively . " Oh , yes , " said Sawyer archly , " quite a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sawyer pursed his lips . " I do n't think I disliked him . He rather amused me . " " Amused ? Why amused ? " For answer Sawyer gestured at the room . " It does n't suggest a prosperous practice , does it ? Well , it is n't . I think I 'm a good lawyer , Mr. Lanigan , but attracting cases that involve large fees calls for a special talent that I 'm afraid I do n't have . However , I 've alwaysmanaged to make a living . Nothing spectacular , you understand , but a living . Now , if you 're a millionaire like Ellsworth Jordon , why would you come to someone like me to draw up your will , especially when it means coming all the way into Boston from Barnard 's Crossing ? " " Maybe he thought if he went to a local lawyer , word might get out about the provisions of the will , " Lanigan suggested . " Most unlikely , Mr. Lanigan , most unlikely , I assure you . Besides , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my services , usually concerning large , spectacular purchases or sales of land . Never anything small or ordinary like the sale of a single houselot , and never to defend him in a law suit . And I 'm sure he 's been sued . A man like Ellsworth Jordon is apt to be . " " So what 's the answer ? " " The answer , Mr. Lanigan , is Emily  --  " again a tilt of the head in the direction of the outer office . " Our acquaintance , Ellsworth and I and Emily , goes back to when we were in college . We were all at different schools , but we belonged to a social club called the Collegiates . He was pretty sweet on Emily , took her out a lot , and finally asked her to marry him . " The smile broadened . " But she turned him down and married me . I 'm quite sure , and Emily agrees , that each time the purpose of his coming here was to let us know how well he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , was to apprise her of the sum total of his success , and also to inform her that though he had never married , he was not unacquainted with conjugal bliss and was the father of a son . " " You mean he was still in love  --  with your wife ? " Sawyer shook his head . " I do n't think he cared a rap for her . He barely spoke to her on the occasions when he came here . He was just determined to show her what a terrible mistake she had131made in turning him down . Do you wonder , Mr. Lanigan , that I 'm amused ? " He peered at Lanigan through half-lidded eyes . " Interesting , at least , would n't you say ? " " Yeah , it 's interesting all right . You know anything else about him that 's  --  interesting ? Anything that might help me ? " " Well , I might make a suggestion , speaking only as a lawyer , you understand . The fact that the boy had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boy 's mother . And while he did not tell the boy that he was naming him his heir , he might have confided in the mother . It might be worthwhile inquiringwhere she was Friday night . " " She was in Europe . " " Are you sure ? " he asked pointedly . " Well . . . " A thought occurred to Lanigan , and he smiled . " Where were you  --  and Emily  --  that Friday night ? " Sawyer began to laugh , a deep gurgling in the throat that sounded as if he were choking . Finally he stopped and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief . " Very good , Mr. Lanigan . " " Well , where were you ? " Sawyer 's face showed annoyance . " We were right here , working late on that same blasted will to ready it for Saturday when he said he 'd be in . " He smiled again and purred , " No doubt the night watchman noted the time of our departure on his register . " 32IT WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished Sunday dinner . His mother had gone upstairs to her room for a nap , and while Molly was in the kitchen finishing the dishes  --  the division of labor between them called for him to wash and for her to wipe and put away  --  he had been in the living room reading the Sunday paper . " Sergeant Holcombe , " his visitor announced and showed his badge pinned in his wallet . " What can I do for you , Sergeant ? " " Can I come in ? " Herb stood aside for him and motioned him to a chair . " You 're Mr. Mandell ? You 're up at the high school , are n't you ? " " That 's right . " " You got my kid sister in bookkeeping . " From the kitchen , Molly called out , " What is it , Herb ? " " Just some school business , " he called back . The sergeant was embarrassed . " Oh , I did n't come to see you about my sister , Mr. Mandell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . I 'd go to the school . Chances are , I would n't go at all . I mean , it would be my dad who 'd come to see you . It was Mrs. Mandell I came to see . " " What about ? " " Oh , it 's just routine , Mr. Mandell . Could I see her for a minute . Could you ask her  --  " But it was unnecessary , for Molly had finished with the dishes and had come into the living room . She looked questioningly at the sergeant . " It 's just a matter of routine , " he apologized . " I 've got some questions  --  " 133 " Of course , Sergeant . " She seated herself beside Herb on the sofa and waited as the sergeant flipped pages of a notebook to a clean page . " It 's about this business Friday night . Mr. Gore said he stopped at a gas station on the road to Boston and phoned you  --  " " You mean they suspect Mr. Gore ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the chief wants everything neat and tidy . This is a pretty important case , and everything has to be just so . I guess what he 's after mostly right now is pinning down the exact time when  --  well , when it happened . Now Mr. Gore do n't remember what time it was when he stopped at the gas station , but he remembers calling you . And the attendant at the gas station do n't remember what time it was but he remembers Mr. Gore making the call , mostly because the outside pay station was out of order and he used the one in the office . So I thought maybe you might remember . " He looked at her hopefully , pencil poised over his notebook . " He did call you , did n't he ? " " Oh yes , he called all right , " she said , " and I remember what time it was , too . It was half past eight . " The sergeant wrote happily in his notebook and then looked up . " You 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so sure ? " " Because I looked at my watch , of course . " " And how did you happen to do that ? Did he ask what time it was ? " " Oh no . I was working on a report for the bank . The reason for Mr. Gore 's call was to see how I was getting on . I was practically finished , and I looked at my watch to see about how soon I would be done . " The sergeant shook his head in wonder . " For the bank , you say . I guess this talk about bankers ' hours is just a lot of talk . " She smiled . " I very frequently take work home , and I know Mr. Gore does almost every night . Most people at the bank do , that is , the executives . " He digested this with a slow nodding of the head . " So he called and asked you how you were getting on and you looked at your watch and said you were almost finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was half past eight by your watch ? " " M-hmm . " He smiled as he rose to go . " And did you ? Did you get it done ? " 134She smiled back at him . " I did , Sergeant . " The sergeant read over what he had written . " Anything else you can tell me , Mrs. Mandell ? " " Like what ? " " Oh , anything that might have bearing on this business . " She hesitated and then shook her head slowly . A thought occurred to him . " The chief may want me to type this out and then have you sign it , " he said . " Then I 'll sign it , of course . " As Mandell showed him to the door , the sergeant said , " My sister , the one who 's taking your course , she likes it . " " Glad to hear it , " said Mandell . " What did you say her name was ? " " Same as mine . Holcombe . Doris Holcombe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a good student . " " I 'll tell her you said so , Mr. Mandell . " " You do that , Sergeant . " 33THE VOICE ON THE TELEPHONE WAS EXCITED AND IMPATIENT . " Rabbi Small ? I 'd like to see you about something . It 's terribly important . Do you have office hours ? " " If it 's terribly important , my office hours are twenty-four hours a day . Whom am I talking to ? " " You do n't know me . My name is Segal . It 's about  --  well , I 'd rather not say over the phone . If you 'd let me know when I can come  --  " " I 'm free for the evening , Mr. Segal . You can come over anytime . Right now , if you like . " " I 'm on my way , Rabbi . " Twenty minutes later as they shook hands , Rabbi Small said , " I 've heard about you , Mr. Segal . " " Oh ? You take a flyer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obvious negation , " Oh , I know . The real estate man , Mr. Maltzman , spoke to you . He said he was going to . He has n't got back to me yet . Is it all right ? " " I 'm sure we 'd all like to have you join our temple , Mr. Segal . There 's no special ceremony necessary . " " But the Bar Mitzvah  --  " " You were Bar Mitzvah when you reached the age of thirteen , whether you had a ceremony or did n't . It just means that by our law you are of age . " He went on to explain the significance of the ceremony and how it had developed to its present proportion . Segal listened , but with no great interest . " Good , " he said when the rabbi finished . " You know after I agreed to do it , I got to thinking about it . I was prepared to go through with it , but it occurred to me that it might be kind of embarrassing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is that what you wanted to see me about , Mr. Segal ? " 136 " Oh no , nothing to do with your temple . It 's about this William Green who 's involved in the murder . Have you been following it at all ? " " I read the local papers , and I listen to the news broad-casts . " " You see , Rabbi , I 'm living in the hotel for the time being , and I take my meals there , too . You ca n't help overhearing conversation , and that 's all they 're talking about . The general consensus seems to be that this William Green did it . I gather that he 's new in town and that he was just visiting with the man who was murdered . And there seems to be some suggestion that the young man is somewhat strange , that he has no friends and keeps to himself . I heard one man say that the proof he was guilty was that the police were keeping him under wraps . I guess there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , it said they were unable to contact him , and in the news broadcast this evening , it said he was unavailable for questioning by the reporter . Then he went on to say he was the son of Hester Grimes , well-known nightclub and TV entertainer . That brought me up sharp , Rabbi , because I know Hester Grimes . " " And you mean he is n't her son ? " " Oh , I do n't know about that . I mean , I do n't know her that well . What I 'm trying to say . . . Look here , I get asked to serve on lots of committees for civic campaigns and charity drives . It is n't that I 'm more charitable or civic-minded than the next fellow , but while the rationale is that I 'm supposed to have proven administrativeand executive ability , the main reason is that it 's presumedI 'll make a large contribution to the cause and induce my wealthy friends to do the same . Well , last year I was involved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come  --  to do a benefit . And when they come , the members of the committee are expected to entertain them , take them to dinner , have them to the house , the works , because they 're not getting paid , you see . Although some of them do . Anyway , I drew this Hester Grimes . I arranged to have her picked up at the airport and brought to our hotel . Then we had dinner , and after her stint at the bazaar , we had her come back to our place . She is a delightful , charming woman , and we sat around and talked , and she told us quite a bit about herself . Grimes is her stage name , Rabbi . Her real name is Green . " " Then that accounts for  --  " 137 " Her original name is Esther Green . She 's a Jewish girl , Rabbi . " The rabbi pursed his lips and considered . He was silent for quite some time as Segal waited expectantly . Then he said quietly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Segal ? " " Well , Rabbi , here 's this young man , just a kid , eighteen or nineteen years old , who is new in town , has no friends , and his mother is somewhere in Europe and probably does n't know anything about this . Now I 'm new here and I do n't know this town , but I know how administrators work . They do n't go looking for trouble , and when it comes , they try to get rid of it as soon as possible , the easiest way . I know if he 's charged , he 'll be represented by a lawyer , maybe one that the court appoints , but . . . look , , I do n't care how fair and decent the policemen or the town fathers are , I know that a young immature boy will not be treated like a grown man , and a friendless stranger wo n't get the same kind of treatment that a resident of the town with family and friends would get . I thought you , as rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , you could claim some standing . I mean , even if I got him a lawyer , he could n't just enter the case and say he 's representing William Green where he had n't asked for him . You see ? " " All right . All right , Mr. Segal . I 'll arrange to see William Green and let him know , well , that he 's not alone . " 34HENRY MALTZMAN DRUMMED HIS FINGERS IMPATIENTLY ON THEdesktop . " If you want to sell your house , Joe , you 'll fix it up . Have it painted  --  " " Painted ? " Krasker was aghast . " That will cost me a thousand , fifteen hundred bucks , maybe more . " " So what ? I 'll get you another five thousand for it . " " Will you give me that in writing ? " " Yeah . That 'll be the day . Look , Joe , get this through your head . Houses are n't bought ; they 're sold . And if you want to sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party out to see your place last week , and he pulls out a jackknife and starts jabbing it into the doorframe where the paint is all bubbled and chipped . I asked him what he was doing , and he said he wanted to see if the wood was rotted . Get the point ? When a place is run down , the customer always thinks it 's worse than it is . Now , it does n't have to cost you all that much to spruce it up . It does n't have to be an A number one job , like if you were doing it for yourself . I got a couple of Greek boys that will slap some paint on it for cheap , and it will look real good . " Krasker finally let himself be convinced . " All right , let them come down and give me an estimate . " Maltzman leaned back in his chair and smiled his satisfaction . " I 'll talk to them personally and tell them I want them to give you the best price they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they 're good boys . Now , how about Sunday ? I 'm depending on you to come through for me . " Krasker squirmed uncomfortably in his seat and focused his eyes on the desktop . It was not easy to disagree with Henry Maltzman . " I do n't know , Henry , " he said . " I 've been thinking139about it a lot . It seems a terrible thing to fire a rabbi , especially where he has n't done anything . " " That 's why , because he has n't done anything , " Maltzman answeredquickly . " I 've proposed I do n't know how many ideas that would build up the temple , increase the membership , and instead of going along , or even remaining neutral , he 's actually bucked me , said he would n't permit it , or that it was against religion or something . And practically every other president has had the same experience with him . Besides , we 're not firing him . We 're just votingnot to re-hire him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I checked into this , you know . When he first came , he was given a one-year contract , like a trial . Then he was given a five-year contract . Then a few years back , he was offered a life contract , and he turned it down . He wanted it only for one year , to be renewed each year . Now what does that mean ? It means he wants to be free to leave . So each time his contract expires , it 's like a new deal , like when a lease expires . I 'm not suggesting we send him a letter saying he has to leave , or that we 're getting another rabbi . I just want for the secretary to send him a letter saying , Dear Rabbi , the board voted eight to seven or ten to five or whatever it is against renewing your contract . ' Now that does n't mean he 's fired . It means he 's like a tenant at will . He could stay on for years maybe . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would we pay him ? " " Oh sure . If he does the work , we 've got to . We 'd pay him the way we pay Stanley , the janitor . He does n't have a contract . " Krasker nodded . " All right , so he 's a tenant at will . But like you said , he could stay on for years . How does that help you ? You want him out . And I do n't mind admitting , I 'd rather have somebody else . But how does it help , if he 's still here even though he does n't have a contract ? " " It would n't  --  much , " Maltzman admitted . " Although I think it would help some . Stands to reason , if the guy has no contract , he can be fired anytime . Okay , so say something happens where he interferes with what we on the board want to do . We can always say , If you do n't like it , Rabbi , pick up your marbles and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't happen that way . I 'm banking that as soon as he gets the letter from the secretary , **30;5824;TOOLONG laughing and joking and making noise . He made sounds to the host and hostess of the rooming house , and to whoever else , the other roomers , who were there . Webster seemed terribly loud : it was as though Webster , too , were someone he had never seen before . He wondered , for the first time , how old Webster was . He knew the ages of Red and Peanut , but he had never seen them before , either . Peanut'scolor glowed like peanut butter and honey , and Red 's broad , brown , speckled face made Arthur see , as though for the first time , his light brown chocolate eyes . Everything hurt : the napkins and the tablecloth hurt ; the black coffee , as the lady poured it , hurt ; his smile , when he looked up and said , Thank you , ma'am , hurt ; the sunlight , relentlessly rising to send them on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen among all the pots and pans , thunderingin the voices , heard from far away and yet too near , of the cook and the servants  --  servants ?  --  and the man scouring the pots , hurt , assaulted , began to devastate my brother ; and the telephone rang somewhere and someone said , Excuse me a moment , and someone else said , I sure hope you boys enjoy yourselves down here , and Webster said , We better make a move , and Red rose first , and Arthur 's heart shook , and then Peanut wiped his lips with the white napkinand smiled , and it hurt ; and someone else said , Barnbam , to Birmingham ! and laughter filled the room exactly like the sunlight , and it hurt . And all this time , Crunch had been seated two seats away , laughing and joking and makingnoise , not looking at him , and yet , and Arthur knew it , entirely concentrated on him , and it hurt . He wanted to run , run , wanted to be with Crunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms ; he did not know what he wanted , the small of his back was wet with terror , Is this my life ? My life ? and , to compound this terror , his imagination , like a newly wiped blackboard , held nothing at all , no images at all . Crunch 's smell was in his nostrils , the overwhelming image of the hair in his armpits , the basketball player 's thighs and ankles , deep like a river , Arthurthought , insanely , his arms , his arms ; then , suddenly ,  |p201silence  dropped on him like a heavy cloud , he looked up , everyone was rising . There was Crunch , on his feet , laughing and joking and making noise , and there was , suddenly , the young lady who had driven all the way back here , this morning , in her father 's automobile , to say good-bye to Crunch , and Crunch was holding her lightly in his arms , and it hurt ; and Arthur wiped his lips with the white , abrasive , fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life , the act of rising to his feet made him tremble with anguish , and he shook hands with all the people , and he smiled and he smiled and he heard his voice falling all around his ears from about twenty-seven million miles above his head ; his feet , just the same , seemed to be on the ground  --  though his shoes , suddenly , were too tight , his ankles ached , his toenails seemed to bite into him , suddenly , like the claws of a crab ; sweat dripped down inside his clothes , from his armpits , from the back of his neck , from all his secret places , and down the inside of his thighs , and Crunch , as though he had known all this all along , looked up , abruptly , looked him directly in his eyes , and said , with a smile which no one else could see  --  and Arthur saw this , it helped him to move , he had , in truth , been paralyzed  --  Come on , little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the young lady . With the other arm , he reached out and pulled Arthur to him , he introducedthem to each other , Arthur smiled and said the Lord alone knows what , and it hurt , it hurt , it hurt . They hurried to their room , to pack  --  they did not have much to pack . Arthur was wet , he was trembling . Crunch locked the door behind them , and stood against the door . Arthur stood in the center of the room . Crunch watched him . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " He picked up his suitcase , and tried to begin to pack . But he was young , my brother , and he started to cry . For a second more , Crunch watched him . " What you crying about ? "  | " Nothing ! " But he looked up at Crunch with tears spilling down his face ; he turned away , and fell on the bed . Crunch fell on the bed on top of Arthur and turned Arthurto face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself around him , arms and legs , held Arthur more tightly than he had ever been held , and kissed him , first like a brother , and then like a lover . He leaned up , and Arthur opened his eyes . " What you got to cry about ? " Arthur simply stared at Crunch . He wanted Crunch never to leave him , never to take his arms away . " Come on , little fellow . We only got a minute . They be knocking on the door in a minute . " Arthur said , terrified , and , at the same time , suddenly at peace , holding on to Crunch , " I 'm in love . " Crunch said gravely , after a moment , " That 's why you was crying ? " Arthur nodded . " I do n't understand  --  who you in love with ? The young lady ? With the automobile ? " Arthur found that he was able to laugh . " No . " Crunch laughed , too , his belly rumbling against Arthur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " With who , then ? " Arthur caught his breath . He watched Crunch 's eyes . " With you . I 'm in love . With you . " And he caught his breath again . He watched Crunch . Doors began opening down the hall . " Well  --  what did I tell you , last night ? " Crunch smiled ; then Arthur smiled . Crunch shook him , lightly . " Come on  --  what did I say ? " " You said  --  you and me . " " What else did I say ? " " You said , you loved me . " " And you do n't believe me ? "  | " I believe you . I  --  just got scared . " " Why ? " " I 've never been in love before , " Arthur said  --  so helplesslythat Crunch kissed him again , laughed , kissed him again , and laughed , and stood up . " Throw them rags in your bag , little fellow  --  before they come knocking on this door  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his suitcase . " I never thought , " said Arthur , " that a man could be in love with a man . " ' Crunch laughed , unlocked and opened the door . " I never thought about it , neither , love . But I 'm sure thinking about it now . " He winked , and his whole face changed , holding a kind of mocking , friendly , unabashed desire . " Tell you one thing , you sure ai n't got nothing to cry about . " He said to Webster , who suddenly appeared in the doorway , " Ready , man , two seconds is all we need . " Webster disappeared . They both closed their suitcases , and Crunch said , in that down-home country-boy preacher 's voice , a voice which Arthur was beginning to feel had been meant for his ears alone , it gave him such delight , " We going to be together . " He looked down the hall , which was empty , everyone was waiting for them on the porch . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched Arthur 's face , lightly , " Come on . " He closed their door behind them . They started toward the voices on the porch . Crunch laughed low in his throat , and he whispered , " You think , just because I 'm bigger than you that I ca n't be in love ? " Birmingham is a biblical city , in the sense that it awaits the sound of Gabriel 's trumpet  --  mile upon mile upon mile , flat , stretched out , lascivious , the city can suggest no other hope : and the sign of the judgment hangs over the city all day and all night long , in the fiery hills . Arthur thought of Sister Dorothy Green , and wondered why she said , " Every time I come to Birmingham . " He would certainly neverp204come back here , if he ever got out , and if there was one righteous man here he had to be in an asylum . They had time to wash and dress , but not to eat  --  but that was all to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was next door to a barbecue place , which stayed open all night . They had known that they would miss Paul ; they had not known that they would begin to hate Webster . In New York , Webster had seemed to know a lot , and they had trusted him . But down here , they realized that he did n't really know all that much , and they realized this from the music that they heard . They wanted to get close to it , this rough and exquisite sound , not yet known as funky  --  hand out , fall out , try out , get high , and learn : there had been something , as Crunch said , waiting here for them , all along . In spite of their terror , they were tremendouslyexcited , and their terror , after all , had nothing to do with black people . They had never known any black people , true , with a house and a lawn , with more than one car , with more than one house for that matter , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matron , dressed in a pale blue whispering frock , with hair like Rita Hayworth 's ; never seen their high-breasted , arrogant daughters , with fingernails which had never rummaged through a garbage can ; never encountered such a lofty , irreproachable politeness , such condescension , kindliness , a distance so **26;5856;TOOLONG ; had never shaken hands with the son , blue blazer , open neck white shirt , dark slacks , dark gleamingpumps , a big ring on one finger , my son is studying law ; never before seen such gleaming sideboards , holding every drink you could imagine ; never before shaken hands with a man with a tiepin and a pipe , our bank president ; never before been smiled down on by the president of our college . Peanut and Red and Crunch and Arthur knew that they stank of the ghetto , and had never really been to school , and they knew that a lot of the black people they met looked down on them , and that a lot of the sons and daughters were making fun of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boys : butp205they felt that they could handle that . They did n't really understand it , and yet , they did , and what they did n't understand , they wanted to find out , to learn . But then , here came Webster  --  sometimes , to their impotentfury , manhandling Crunch 's guitar . He came on , Arthur told me , later , like he was Cab Calloway , and we were his Cabettes . He told everyone how big they were in the North , how he had discovered them , and trained them , made them go to bed early , gave them their cod-liver oil  --  told everyone listening  --  college presidents , bank presidents , lawyers , matrons , sons , daughters , servants ; told the honeysuckle , wisteria , magnolia ; told the long , tall verandas and the somnolentporches , the long , still , flat , country streets ; told the fireflies of their punishing schedule , their upcoming dates  --  in Chicago , in Detroit , in Denver , in Washington and , especially , in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose , how he had three phones ringing all the time , sayingyes here , saying no there , how his secretaries were tearingtheir hair , and soon , he would have to make some kind of decision about England  --  while the boys stood around him helplessly  --  fascinated , terrified , humiliated , hating him . They watched the glass in his hand , and the way , from time to time , he smiled at his hosts  --  smiled as though he could buy them and sell them , with a phone call to Pittsburgh . When the moment came to roll , to get into the stationwagon , he always made a joke about the sheriff . Oh , we know the sheriff , one of the aristocrats might say , he knows you 've been at our house . Good night , one of the boys might say , grimly  --  with the choked , despairing politeness of the beleaguered adolescent . Good night ! came back from the shadows , and on went the headlights and down the road they went , Webster cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieved guitar . It was a white city full of black people  --  they had not thought of New York this way  --  and none but the righteous , Arthur thought , as they took their places just below the pul/pit , in the Birmingham church . They were placed so that Peanut , at the piano , could be seen . Peanut struck the chord , Arthur began the song . Red was to his right and Crunch to his left , both slightly behind him , as present as heat . Crunch 's guitar began , as Arthur 's voice began , Take me to the waterCrunch moaned , yes ! take me to the water ! He heard Red 's witnessing falsetto , but he answered Crunch 's echo , take me to the waterto bebaptized . He paused , and closed his eyes , sweat gathered in his hair ; he listened to Crunch , then he started again , Take me to the wateryeah ! take me to the waternow ! take me to the wateroh , Lord ! to beto be ? to betell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , threw back his head to get the sweat out of his eyes , trusting every second of this unprecedented darkness , knowing Crunch and he were moving together , here , now , in the song , to some new place ; they had never sung together like this before , his voice in Crunch 's sound , Crunch 's sound filling his voice , SoI knownonedo n't tell mc , I know , I know , I know !  |p207as  though Crunch were laughing and crying at the same timebut the righteousso true ! nonedo n't you leave me now ! but the righteousand I hate to see that evening sun go down ! noneamazing grace  --  ! none but the righteousyea , little fellow , come on in ! shall see God . Crunch and he ending together , as though on a single drum . He opened his eyes , bowed his head , stepped back . Red and Peanut looked as though they had been dragged , kicking , through a miracle , but they were smiling , the church was rocking , Crunch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Peanut struck the chord , Oh . Oh . Oh . Oh , and Crunch stepped forward with the guitar , singing , somebody touched me and , they sang , it must have been the hand of the Lord ! It was a heavy , slow Saturday afternoon in Atlanta , and they were free until Sunday morning . Webster had disappearedearly , with many a vivid warning , and they were glad to be on their own ; but his warnings remained with them , and the heat was as heavy as the region 's molasses . They would have liked to discover the town , and they walked awhile , but they did not dare walk very far . If they got lost , they would have to ask someone for directions , and so they panicked whenever they saw more white faces than black faces . They had been made to know that they were from the North , and that their accents betrayed them and might land them on the chain gang . It happened every day down here , and , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And the city was like a checkerboard . They would walk ap208block which was all black , then suddenly turn a corner and find themselves surrounded by nothing but white faces . They wanted to run , but , of course , to run meant that the white mob would run after them and they would , then , be lynched . At such moments , they smiled aimlessly , looked in a store window , if there was one , or else elaborately admiredthe view , slowing their walk to a shuffle . Then , as though the same idea had hit them at the same moment  --  which it had  --  they slowly turned and slowly walked back the way they had come . Sometimes they nearly exploded with the terrified laughter they had not dared release until they were again surrounded by black people , or back in the rooming house . So this Saturday afternoon , they returned to the cafe next to the rooming house . Webster had prepaid their Saturday lunch and dinner . They had a little money in their pockets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Webster had all their money . This frightened them , too , but they did not know what to do about it . They had to trust Webster . Wordlessly , though , they trusted Crunch , who was the only one of them who might be able to intimidate Webster . They sat down in the cafe , which was nearly empty  --  they had not yet realized that Southerners move about as little as possible on hot summer afternoons : in general , that is , due to imponderables to which they were reacting , but did not understand  --  and Peanut and Crunch went to the counter , and brought back four Pepsi-Colas . " Tell you , " said Red . " This trip is starting to fuck with my nerves . Ca n't wait to get back to Seventh Avenue . " " When you was there , " said Arthur , smiling , " you could n't wait to get away . " He lit a cigarette and put the pack on the table . " But I know how you feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peanut said . " And we do n't know nobody . Be different , next time . " " How ? " asked Red . " How we going to get to know somebodynext time ? You going to write a letter to the gover-nor ? "  |p209Crunch  laughed , and picked up the pack of cigarettes , and lit one . " Well , " said Peanut , " if we keep coming back , we bound to get to know  --  somebody  --  " They all laughed , and , after a moment , Peanut laughed . Crunch said , " Well , you know somebody  --  at least , you knew somebody  --  them cousins of yours in Charlotte  --  " Peanut sighed and looked down at the table . " Yeah . I 'm sorry about that . " Crunch leaned across the table and clapped Peanut on the shoulder . " What you sorry about ? You ca n't help it if your cousins are fools . " Peanut is the lightest of us , and Crunch is the darkest , and Peanut 's cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt Crunch 's feelings , and they reminded Peanutof his bewildering grandmother . " Oh , little by little , we 'll figure out how to move , " Red said cheerfully . " I 'll find me a swinging chick at one of these church socials and make her be our guide . " " These chicks all looking to get married , man , " Crunch said . " And they do n't want to marry none of us . What do a bank president 's daughter want with  --  a wandering trouba-dor ? " " Oh , hell , Crunch , " said Peanut . " Love will find a way . " " Not down here , in the land of cotton , " Arthur said , and they laughed . " Anyway , " Crunch said after a moment , " little Arthur'sthe only one liable to come down here next time . " They all looked at Crunch . " Why ? " asked Arthur . Crunch looked at Arthur . " Where 's your brother ? " Arthur said , " My brother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express train , stopped . " Oh , shit , " said Red . " You right . " " Right about what ? " Arthur asked . But he knew . He had never thought of it . " Uncle Sam is saving some people over yonder , " Crunch said . " He 's making the world safe for democracy again , and he needs some niggers for the latrine detail . "  |p210The  table became very silent . " Shit , " Red said again . Arthur said nothing . He did not know what to say . He did not dare look up . He looked at the white marble table , and the brown rings made by the Pepsi-Cola bottles . Then he looked very carefully at the flypaper suspended from the ceiling , with flies sticking , stuck , on the yellow paper . He wondered how many flies there were , and thought of counting them . He was suddenly aware that there was an electric fan whirring nearby  --  if you put your fingers in the fan , the blades would chop your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  he was not thinking . " Well , let 's not sit here like this , " Peanut said shakily . " Let 's do something . " Yes , but what ? A movie would have been ideal , but then , there was the question of whether black people sat in the balcony , or came in through the back door . None of them knew how it worked down here  --  they had forgotten to ask , or could n't remember the answers . " Hell , " Red said , suddenly , " there 's a black pool hall on the corner , let 's go shoot some pool . " " Okay , " Crunch said , and everybody rose except Arthur . They all looked at him . " Ai n't you coming ? " " Look , " Arthur said calmly , with a smile , " you all go ahead . I might pick you up later . I got a little headache , I just want to lie down . " Crunch raised that eyebrow at him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You cats go on , I 'll dig you later . " " Okay . " The three of them pranced out into the sun , paused for a moment , laughing , before the great glass window . Arthur waited until they had disappeared . Then he rose slowly , leaning lightly on the table , and walked outside . The sun was like a blow . He looked in the direction the boys had taken  --  saw them , on the still , far corner , ambling across the street . Then he turned in the opposite direction . The roomingp211house was next door , really more like a hotel , a narrow , three-story building . Peanut and Red and Webster were on the ground floor . He and Crunch were on the top floor . He walked into the long , dark , narrow hall , which was absolutelysilent , and slowly , shaking , climbed the stairs . He was covered with cold sweat by the time he reached the top floor , and his hands were shaking so hard he could hardly get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door swung open . Sunlight hammered on the room , and he crossed to the window and pulled down the shade . He ran cold water in the sink , and plunged his face and head under , blindly found the towel , and dried himself . He kicked off his shoes , unpeeled his socks , took off his shirt and trousers , and lay down on Crunch 's bed . Korea . He lay there for a long time , numb , as empty as the listeningsilence , stunned . He lay on his back . The air did not move . He did not move . The sun would not move , the earth , the stars , the moon , the planets , whatever held it all together , the big wheel and the little wheel , and the boulder of his sorrow , which had dropped on him and pinned him to this bed , nothing would move , until he saw Crunch . Korea . He fell asleep . Crunch shook him gently . The room was half dark , not dark yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him carefully , with that eyebrow raised , half smiling , half frowning . " You feel better ? " Arthur stared , saying nothing , then he smiled . " You 're back . " " Of course I 'm back . You feel better ? " Arthur moved and put his head in Crunch 's lap , holding on to him and staring up at him . The room grew darker . They were alone . Crunch leaned down , and kissed him . Arthur held on to Crunch with all his strength , with all his tears , tears he had not yet begun to shed . Crunch leaned up . " Let me lock the door , " he whispered . Arthur sat up , and watched Crunch lock the door.  |p212He  did it very elaborately , and then turned , grinning , with one finger to his lips . " We all alone , now , little fellow . Ai n't nobody on this floor but us . And it 's Saturday night , anyway , everybody 's out . " He grinned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at Arthur . " Where 's Peanut and Red ? " Arthur was whispering , and Crunch whispered , " I left them in the pool hall . They found some friends . " " They coming back ? " " I told them I was taking you someplace . " He sat down on the bed again , and started taking off his shoes . He looked over at Arthur . " Did I do right ? " " Sure . " " Get under the covers . " Arthur watched as Crunch stripped  --  Crunch was whistling , low in his throat : and it came to Arthur , with great astonishment , that Crunch was whistling because he was happy  --  was happy to be here , with Arthur . Arthur watched as Crunch unbuttoned his shirt , watched the long , dark fingers against the buttons and the cloth , watched the cloth fly across the room to land on the other bed , watched as he unbuckled his belt , dropped his trousers , raising one knee then the other , sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then folding the trousers , and risingto place them on the other bed , pulling off his undershirt , kicking off his shorts , his whole , long , black self padding to the small sink , where he looked , briefly , into the mirror , ran cold water , gargled , his dark body glowing in the darkening room , a miracle of spinal column , neck to buttocks , shoulders and shoulder blades , elbows , wrists , thighs , ankles , a miracle of bone and blood and muscle and flesh and music . Arthur was still wearing his undershirt and his shorts . He hated being naked in front of anyone , even me  --  perhaps , especially me ; I had sometimes given him his bath : but that had been under another condition , for which he had not been responsible , and which he was not compelled to remember . Nakedness had not , then , beenp213a confession , or a vow . Arthur was frightened ; then , he was n't frightened ; but he found that he could not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not take off his shorts . Crunch turned , and Arthur , in a kind of peaceful terror , watched as the face , and the eyes in that face , and the neck and the chest , and the nipples on the chest , and the ribs and the long flat belly and the belly button and the jungle of hair spinning upward from the long , dark , heavy , swinging sex approached , and Crunch got under the covers , and took Arthur in his arms . Crunch sighed , a weary , trusting sigh , and put his hands under Arthur 's undershirt and pulled it over Arthur 's head , and , suddenly , they both laughed , a whispering laugh . Crunch dropped the undershirt on the floor . " That 's called progress , " Crunch whispered . " And now , " he said , " let 's see what we can do down yonder . " He put his hands at Arthur 's waist , pulled the shorts down , got them past one foot . Arthur 's prick rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough progress , for now , " he said , but he put his rigid sex against Arthur 's , and then they simply lay there , holding on to each other , unable to make another move . They really did not know where another move might carry them . Arthur was afraid in one way , and Crunch in another . It was also as though they had expended so much energy to arrive at this moment that they had to fall out and catch their breath , this moment was almost enough . But it was only a moment : the train was boarded , the engine ready to roll . They held on to each other . This might be the beginning ; it might be the beginning of the end . The train was boarded , the engine pulsing , great doors were slamming shut behind them , the train would soon be moving , a journey had begun . They might lose each other on this journey ; nothing could be hidden on this journey . They might look at each other , miles from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wish never to see each other again . They might be ashamed  --  they might be debased : they might be forever lost.  |p214Arthur  was less frightened than Crunch . He simply held on to Crunch and stroked him and kissed him , for , in the center of his mind 's eye , there was Crunch in uniform , Crunch gone , Crunch forever gone , and , now that he had found him , his mind became as still and empty as the winter sky , at the thought of losing him . He held this blankness as far inside him as he held his tears  --  for , somethingtold him that Crunch could not bear his tears , could not bear anybody 's tears . Tears were a weapon you could use against Crunch . And Crunch  --  ah , Crunch . He held my brother , falling in love  --  falling in love with the little fellow . Crunch was older than Arthur , lonelier than Arthur , knew more about himself than Arthur knew . He had never been on this train , true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held him closer , falling in love , his prick stiffening , his need rising , his hope rising ; the train began to move , Arthur held him closer , and Crunch moved closer , becoming more naked , praying that Arthur would receive his nakedness . His long self covered Arthur , his tongue licked Arthur 's nipples , his armpits , his belly button . He did not dare go further , yet ; shaking , he raised himself to Arthur 's lips . He took Arthur 's sex in his fist . " Do me like I do you , " he whispered . " Little fellow , come on , this is just the beginning , " and Arthur , with a kind of miraculous understanding , kissed Crunch 's nipples , slid down to kiss his sex , moved up to his lips again . As he felt Crunch pulsing , he pulsed with Crunch , coaxed the pulsing vein at the underside of the organ as Crunch coaxed his , scarcely breathing . Crunch groaned , little fellow , groaned again , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding air , then Crunch 's sperm shot out against Arthur 's belly , Arthur 's shot against his , it was as though each were coming through the other 's sex . They lay in each other 's arms . Crunch looked into his Arthur 's eyes . " Hi . " " Hi , yourself . "  |p215Their  breathing slowed . Neither wanted to move . " You think we making progress ? " " I 'm with you . " They laughed , holding on to each other , wet with each other . Crunch asked shyly , " Do you still love me ? " " Maybe we should make some more progress . " Crunch shook with laughter , silently , and Arthur shook with joy , watching him . " Right now ? " " Whenever you ready . " " Oh  --  come on  --  ! " said Crunch . " That 's what I said . " " You  --  you something  --  " " I love you . I 'd do anything for you , " said Arthur . Crunch watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crunch held him tighter . " I want to make love with you  --  every way possible  --  Ido n't care what happens  --  as long as I can hold you . " Hewatched Arthur 's eyes ; but he was beginning to feel at peace . " You want to make progress , I 'll make progress . We'llmake progress together . " Crunch asked , " You and me , then ? " " You and me . " The room was dark . They heard the night outside . They did not want to leave each other 's arms . Crunch asked , " You hungry ? " " No  --  not now . " " You want to wash up ? " " No . Not yet . " " What you want to do then ? " " Maybe sleep a little  --  next to you . " " Okay . " They curled into each other , spoon fashion , Arthur cradledby Crunch . They did not sleep long . Arthur woke up , and peed in the sink , as quietly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted the shade , and looked out of the win/dow . It was night , he guessed it to be around nine or ten o'clock ; there were not as many people in the street as there would have been on a Saturday night in Harlem . Most of the people were already inside some place , or they were on their way , and their voices , and their music , muffled , filled the air , filled the room . He dropped the shade . Crunch lay as he had left him . One arm was at his side , one arm lay stretched where Arthur had been . His breathing was deep and slow  --  yet Arthur sensed that Crunch was not entirely lost in sleep . Arthur crawled back into bed , pulling the covers back up . The moment he crawled into bed , Crunch , still sleeping , pulled Arthur into his arms . And yet , Crunch lay as one helpless . Arthur was incited by this helplessness , the willing helplessness of the body in his arms . He kissed Crunch , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands up and down the long body . He seemed to discover the mystery of geography , of space and time , the lightning flash of tension between one  --  moment ?  --  one breath and the next breath . The breathing in  --  the breathing out . The miracle of air , entering , and the chest rose : the miracle of air transformed into the miracle of breath , comingout , into your face , mixed with Pepsi-Cola , hamburgers , mustard , whatever was in the bowels : and the chest fell . He lay in this urgency for a while , terrified , and happy . He held Crunch closer , running his fingers up and down the barely tactile complex telegraph system of the spine . His hands dared to discover Crunch 's beautiful buttocks , his ass , his behind . He stroked the gift between his legs which held the present and the future . Their sex became rigid . Crunch growled , turned on his back , still holding Arthur . Arthur moved , in Crunch 's arms , belly to belly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rising prick : Crunch moaned . Arthur knew something that he did not know he knew  --  he did not know that he knew that Crunch waited for Arthur 's lips at his neck , Arthur 's tongue at the nipples of his chest . Pepsi-Cola , mustard , hamburgers , ice cream , surrendered to funkier , unknownp217odors ; Crunch moaned again , surrendering , surrendering , as Arthur 's tongue descended Crunch 's long black self , down to the raging penis . He licked the underside of the penis , feeling it leap , and he licked the balls . He was setting Crunch free  --  he was giving Crunch what he , somehow , knew that Crunch longed and feared to give him . He took the penis into his mouth , it moved , with the ease of satin , past his lips , into his throat . For a moment , he was terrified : what now ? For the organ was hard and huge and throbbing , Crunch 's hands came down , but lightly , on Arthur'shead , he began to thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur understood Crunch 's terror  --  the terror of someone in the water , being carried away from the shore  --  and this terror , which was his own terror , soon caused him to gasp , to attempt to pull away , at the same time that he held on . His awareness of Crunch 's terror helped him to overcomehis own . He had never done this before . In the same way that he knew how Crunch feared to be despised  --  by him  --  he knew , too , that he , now , feared to be despised by Crunch . Cocksucker . Well . It was Crunch 's cock , and so he sucked it ; with all the love that was in him , and a moment came when he felt that love being trusted , and returned . A moment came when he felt Crunch pass from a kind of terrified bewildermentinto joy . A friendly , a joyful movement , began . So high , you ca n't get over him . Sweat from Arthur 's forehead fell onto Crunch 's belly . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prick standing in the cold , cold air , as Arthur 's tongue licked his sacred balls you ca n't get under him . Arthur rose , again , to Crunch 's lips . So wide . You ca n't get around him . It was as though , with this kiss , they were forever bound together . Crunch moaned , in an absolute agony , and Arthur went down again . " Little fellow . Baby . Love . " You must come in at the door . He held the prick in his mouth again , sensing , awaiting ,  |p218the  eruption . He , and he alone , had dragged it up from the depths of his lover . " Oh . Little fellow . " Then , shaking like an earthquake , " Oh , my love . Oh , love . " Atlanta was still . The world was still . Nothing moved in the heavens . " Oh . Love . " Curious , the taste , as it came , leaping , to the surface : of Crunch 's prick , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was frightened , but triumphant . He wanted to sing . The taste was volcanic . This taste , the aftertaste , this anguish , and this joy had changed all tastes forever . The bottom of his throat was sore , his lips were weary . Every time he swallowed , from here on , he would think of Crunch , and this thought made him smile as , slowly , now , and in a peculiar joy and panic , he allowed Crunch to pull him up , upward , into his arms . He dared to look into Crunch 's eyes . Crunch 's eyes were wet and deep deep like a river , and Arthur found that he was smiling peace like a river . Arthur asked Crunch , " All right ? do you feel all right ? " Crunch put Arthur 's head on his chest , ran one long hand up and down Arthur . " You 're the most beautiful thing ever happened to me , baby , " he said . " That 's how I feel . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " Arthur asked  --  teasing , bewildered , triumphant  --  andsafe in Crunch 's arms . " For loving me , " Crunch said . After a moment , he pulled up the covers . They went to sleep , spoon fashion , Arthur cradling Crunch . Nothing can be hidden ; secrets do not exist . They were on the road for ten more days . They were called the " lovebirds , " they were called " Romeo and Romeo . " They laughed , with their arms around each other sometimes , far too happy to be afraid . For one thing , they were far toop219young to be afraid . As far as they knew , and as far as they cared , what was happening between them had never before happened in the entire history of the world . Other people had words for whatever it was , too bad , too sad  --  they were not to be found in that dictionary . They walked in the light of each other 's eyes , absolutely unaware of white people or black people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not knowing what town it was , and not caring : they were called " lovebirds " and " Romeo and Romeo " because they were alone , they were far from other people , they were in danger . Peanut and Red were happy simply because Crunch and Arthur were happy . They responded to the outward signs : Arthur laughed and talked more and ate more , and Crunch , before their eyes , seemed to become the lord of a vast and beautiful territory . Arthur was his princedom , or , because of Arthur , he began to stride  --  Crunch was in love . Yes . That is the only way to put it . And Arthur , my brother , Arthur  --  he was in love , certainly , as irrepressible as a puppy ; if Crunch strode on those long legs of his , Arthur seemed to get from one place to another by unpredictable leaps and lunges ; but he was far less vulnerable . He did not know this then , he adored Crunch , but time was to reveal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . When , many years later , Crunch was dragged , howling , away from us , with that dreadful space in his mouth where his teeth had been , the sands in Arthur began to shift into that despair which was to kill him . Arthur was stronger than Crunch : it is as simple , as dreadful , and as mysterious as that . Arthur could bear solitude , had been born to it , and could never be surprised by it , however mightily he might be tormented : Crunch feared solitude , and was easily bewildered , he could not live without love . But Arthur could live on stones  --  he sought love everywhere , but he could live on stones . He could wring nourishmentfrom the silence of stone . He could surrender to Crunch so eagerly , and give all of himself , because not all of himself was his to give . There was , in him , a secret placep220which could scarcely be entered  --  a goddamn echo chamber !  --  he was to cry to me much later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this then . He began to be reconciled to this near the end of his life , with his last lover , Jimmy , who was the only person in Arthur 's life as strong as he , who loved him more than Arthur ever knew ; Jimmy , who trusted Arthur 's secret place , who knew he could not live if it were violated , who calculated , coldly , in towns , in planes , in beds , sometimes with Arthur 's arms around him , how to keep his lover alive , how to live if his lover was gone . But then  --  Arthur knew nothing about death , Peanut and Red knew nothing of love or passion . Crunch and Arthur were funny , and there was a light around them  --  perhaps , in their differing ways , Peanut and Red smelled a certain freedom , the way a horse smells water . They did not think of Crunch and Arthur as lovers , a condition which they could not , yet , really imagine , but as two cats who had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Red was Peanut 's " heart . " That was really all there was to know . All else was a private matter , and it would never have occurred to them to violate this privacy . But Webster was a very different matter , " What 's going on between you two ? " he demanded of Crunch . This was on a Sunday afternoon , on the steps of a church in a Virginia backwater  --  from here they went to Washington , D.C. , and home . " What 's that , sir ? " Crunch asked very carefully . Arthur and Red and Peanut were somewhere behind them . Crunch walked as slowly as possible . " You hard of hearing ? " " Sometimes , sir . When people do n't speak up . Or when they  --  shout . " They were forced to continue descending the steps . " The boys , " said Webster . " I hear them call you lovebirds . And you and little Arthur , you and him always runningoff together . " He looked at Crunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't let what the boys say worry me none , " Crunch said . " They just fooling around  --  boys will be boys , " he added , and looked into Webster 's face . " I 'll ask you again , " said Webster . They were now at the bottom of the steps . They were forced to keep moving because of the people behind them , and because they could not afford to seem to be quarreling . They walked for a few seconds . Crunch did not look behind him , for he knew that Arthur could see him : nevertheless , he walked very slowly . " What was your question , sir ? " Webster looked at Crunch , and Crunch looked at Webster . " I 'm a very understanding guy , " Webster said , slowly . " You do n't know me . " Crunch said nothing . " Shall I ask you the question again ? " " Yes . Maybe you better . " " You two "  --  they stopped , and looked at each other  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He signaled Arthur . Arthur signaled back , and started toward him . Crunch , with his hands in his pockets , turned and looked at Webster , and grinned . " What do you mean ? What do you think we doing ? " They kept walking , in the chilly air , and Crunch allowed his guitar to bounce , lightly , on his back . " I told you  --  I 'm a very understanding guy . " " You so understanding , you want to know what we doing . Why ? " " I might want to do it , too . " Crunch stared at Webster , then said , in a shaking voice , " You do n't know what we doing , but you might want to do it , too . " " Why not ? Or  --  I can always make you change rooms . " Crunch stopped . He and Webster looked at each other . Crunch threw back his head and laughed . Carefully , he fingered the shoulder strap of his guitar.  | " You ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , cheerfully . " I 'll beat your brains out if you try . And I 'll tell everybody what you doing  --  you do n't know what I 'm doing . Anyway , we going home , faggot , and we do n't need you no more . " He kept his voice low and cheerful , with a slight smile on his face , for the benefit of the people . " Tell you something else  --  you say a word to a livingass , or you try to lay a hand on Arthur , you wo n't have no tongue , no hands , and no asshole  --  you 'll find yourself in a mighty sorry condition . We going to finish up down here , real sweet and easy , and then we going home and we do n't need you no more , ever . You going to pay us , and we going home . And I know you know  --  that I know you going to pay us . " Arthur came loping up , and Crunch laughed and threw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chilly wind . " Anyway , you ca n't do what we do , brother . You ca n't sing . " Webster certainly could not imagine what Arthur and Crunch would find themselves doing , an hour or so before they had to jump in the shower and put on their clothes and rush out and face the people  --  wrestling all around the room , laughing , knowing that the clock was ticking , but so happy that they knew that , somehow , they would be dressed and ready and go out and do their number  --  so that they could come home , and fall out , and make love again . They were beginning to know each other ; the biblical phrase unlocked itself and held them together in a joy as sharp as terror . Crunch lay on his belly for Arthur and pulled Arthur into him , and Arthur lay on his belly for Crunch , and Crunch entered Arthur  --  it was incredible that it hurt so much , and yet , hurt so little , that so profound an anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transformation , I looked at my hands and they looked new , I looked at my feet and they did , too ! But that is how they sang , really , something like fifteen minutes later , out of the joy ofp223their surrender and deliverance , out of their secret knowledge that each contained the other . Webster paid the boys , in Washington , ironically meticulous , and with a hostility covered no more effectively  --  though certainly as vividly  --  than Adam and Eve imagined themselves to be covered by the poor fig leaves when God came stalking through the garden . He did not , and he clearly regretted this , have anything resembling a flaming sword ; and , furthermore , unlike God , he had no way of knowing what the boys might have whispered among themselves concerning his performance as the serpent . He not only lacked the flaming sword , but , what was worse , he had no apple . Peanut and Red were bewildered . They thought that Webster 's manner might have been caused by the fact  --  the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York with them . Crunch had " business , " in Washington , some people he had to see : he and Arthur were going to stay in Washington for a day or two , and would be coming home by train . Webster protested that he had to say something to the child 's parents . But Crunch said that he and Arthur had alreadygot our parents ' permission , which was true . It had been Crunch 's idea , and he was risking a lot : for he was , after all , more than three years older than Arthur , and he could not really know what Webster might say , once in New York . But he knew that Paul and Florence trusted him  --  he gambled on his love . He felt that no one who loved Arthur could doubt how much Crunch loved him . And he was right about that , I would know . The shadow of their separation , so soon , the shadow of the army , of Korea , fell more heavily every day , on him and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to be alone with each other , for a few more hours . They would not be alone in New York , not in the same way . Arthur would be with his mother and his father . Crunch had a furnished room , downtown , on Fourteenth Street and Third Avenue , but he would really be with hisp224family , and he had , furthermore , another problem : he had to have money for his mother . But he had to be with Arthur , too , and Arthur did not have to have money for his mother . Arthur was expected to have made some money for himself . This came , in a way , to the same thing , but Arthur 's margin was wider , it was a bridge he could cross when he got to it . The shadow of the army was heavy , also , on Peanut and Red , but , in a way , they looked forward to it . Peanut would not be sorry to leave his grandmother , and Red would not be sorry to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , had there not been so much holding him  --  his mother , his brothers , and sisters . And he could quickly have been reconciled even to that , since his mother would have an allotment and the children would not starve  --  but : there was Arthur . He was in love , for the first time consciously , and as perhaps only the very young can be in love . He fell deeper in love with every hour , he loved Arthur more every day . If he had felt a certain panic , bewilderment , at the realization that he had fallen in love with a male , this panic was as nothing compared to his private apprehension that he was more in love with Arthur than Arthur was with him . Arthur was younger , blazed with wonder , as elusive and unpredictable as a kitten . He would be a full-grown cat when Crunch came back -- what they might have longed to endure together each would have been forced to endure alone . They would be changed . Red and Peanut dreaded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , far from home , but Crunch 's youth was ending here , now , where he stood . The ground floor of the hotel was a drugstore , which seemed to be open around the clock , never empty , never still . It seemed to function as black community headquarters . Later , Arthur was to discover it , at five o'clock in the morning , still open , with a lone black lady , wearing a hat , sitting at the counter , staring down into her coffee , belching her wine , or with a black boy , sitting , stoned , at one of the tables.  |p225Webster  , after he had paid the boys , decided to doublecheckwith Paul and Florence , and went into a phone booth . Arthur opened the door of the phone booth , and stood there while Webster talked . He did not ask to speak to his parents . Webster said his good-byes , and hung up . " Did n't they say it was all right ? " Arthur asked . " Yeah , " said Webster irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had to double-check , that 's all . " " I understand , sir , " Arthur said . " I was just doublechecking , myself . " Webster looked at him sharply , but Arthur did not look at Webster , and they walked through the drugstore , onto the sidewalk , where Peanut , Crunch , and Red stood talking , next to the station wagon . " Is everything all right , then , sir ? " Crunch asked cheerfully , of Webster  --  but the question was directed at Arthur . Both Arthur and Webster understood this , but only Websterwas compelled to reply . " Everything 's all right , " said Webster , and got into the car . He leaned out of the window . " Come on now , we ready to roll . " The boys shook hands and held each other 's shoulders a moment , all four of them terrified now . Crunch was the first to move  --  he leaned in the window , saying to Webster , " Drive carefully , man , you got a precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the station wagon , Red in front , Peanut in back . " See you in a couple of days ! " cried Arthur . The station wagon moved out into the traffic , the hands of the boys waving outside the windows . Peanut turned all the way around , his face against the back window , his long hand waving in the air . Crunch and Arthur stood on the sidewalk until the wagon stopped at the first red light . The light changed , and the wagon disappeared . Crunch turned and looked at Arthur , his hands in his pockets . " Hey . Little fellow . "  | " Hey , yourself . " They had a room on the top floor , just under the roof , in this unknown and really somewhat terrifying hotel ; it was the end of summer . " Let 's go on up and change , " Crunch said , " and maybe try to see this town ? " With his hands in his pockets and that eyebrow raised , and leaning toward the kid , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the drugstore . At the end of the length of the drugstore were doors opening onto the hotel lobby , and the elevator . A jukebox was playing . The counter sold ice cream sodas , Arthur noted , sandwiches , tea , milk , and hot dogs  --  the counter was too busy , and Crunch and Arthur were moving too fast for Arthur to be able to register it all . " Hey ! " he told Crunch . " We can eat here ! " Crunch was striding to the doors which led to the hotel lobby . He slowed his pace . " You hungry ? " " No . Not yet . I just wonder how long it stays open . " They walked through the doors , into the hotel lobby . Crunch had kept the hotel key in his pocket , and so they walked straight to the elevators . Crunch had stayed in one or two hotels before this , on his own , but Arthur never had . He was fascinated by everything , and terrified  --  fascinated by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the noise . All of the faces they passed were black . The sound was black . Dimly , swiftly , from far away , a white face might move into the light , then out of it . The white face might gleam in a distant corridor , opening or closing a door , or be discerned , briefly , behind the wire mesh of a cage . Otherwise the faces were black . The elevator operator , who took his time arriving , was black . " How you boys doing ? " he asked , with a fine and friendly indifference and Crunch said , " Just fine , sir , " and gave him the number of their floor.  | " Ah , " said the old black man , " you going to the penthouse . I know how you boys doing . " The elevator groaned upward , and , eventually , he stopped it , and opened the doors . " Watch your step , " he said . " Good night . " " Thank you , sir , " Crunch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me , sir , how long the drugstore downstairs stays open ? " " It do n't never really close . But , if you want to eat , hit it before two o'clock in the morning . Later than that , you taking a chance  --  and not just on the food  --  " " Thank you , sir , " said Crunch , after a moment . " Good night . " " Good night , " said the old one . " Do n't let the noise up here bother you . " He closed the elevator doors , and the elevatorgroaned on down . But now , it was the early afternoon , and there was no noise at all . They walked the silence to their room , and Crunch unlocked the door . They entered the room , the low and stifling room , just under the roof , a room with two short , narrow beds , one window , a small sink with a naked light bulb over it , the only light in the room . Crunch locked the door behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the room . " I reckon we going be sleeping on the floor , " he said . Then he looked at Arthur . Then he laughed  --  leaned his head against the door , opened his arms , and laughed out loud . Then he stopped laughing , pulled Arthur into his arms , stroked that face , and kissed it , looking into Arthur 's eyes . " Do n't tell me , " he said . " I know . I know I 'm crazy . I 'm crazy about you , I 'm where I want to be  --  okay ? " Arthur murmured , " You sure ask some crazy questions , man . I do n't mind sleeping on the floor . " Whoever is born in New York is ill-equipped to deal with any other city : all other cities seem , at best , a mistake , and , at worst , a fraud . No other city is so spitefully incoherent . Whereas other cities flaunt their history  --  their presumedp228glory  --  in vividly placed monuments , squares , parks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been unable entirely to obliterate is to be found , mainly , in the backwaters of Wall Street , in the goat tracks of Old and West Broadway , in and around Washington Square , and , for the relentless searcher , in grimly inaccessible regions of The Bronx . There are some exceedingly vivid monuments along Riverside Drive , but Riverside Drive , alas for history , is on the western edge of Harlem . No plaque indicates that Harlem was once a Dutch province , with two a 's to its name , or that the movie house , on 42nd Street , the New Amsterdam , bears the name the city was given when , again by means of the Dutch , it entered recorded , or acceptable , history . The Dutch lost the city to the English , who , being passionately devoted to a city on their island named York , decided that this was New York . The name of the island , an Indian name , Manhattan , was never changed . The conquerorshad overlooked something . I always like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far , but no farther . Manhattan , the island on which the city rests , is stronger than New York . As time has begun to indicate ; as we shall see . On the other hand , the spiteful incoherence of New York is , at bottom , more bearable than the grotesque pieties of Philadelphia , say , or Boston , or Washington . No one in Philadelphia gives a shit about Benjamin Franklin . No one in Boston gives a shit about Crispus Attucks , or for that so celebrated and overestimated tea party  --  an event which , clearly , on the basis of the history of the city , was a purely mercantile , exasperated upheaval , involving nothing more noble than self-interest . What breaks the heart , though , is that self-interest is indispensable to any human endeavor , is the universal human motor , and is noble or ignoble , depending on one 's concept of the self . I have said , for example , that I knew I could not live without my brother : can anyone ? At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different self without him , if indeed , that self would have been able to live at all . Ip229am tipping my hand , I am jumping ahead , but no matter . Beloved . Beloved . Now , we are the sons of God  --  the first song Arthur sang , after they had arrived in New York , and when he knew that Crunch was with Julia , was trying to heal her by the laying on of hands . I 'm not joking , children , compassioncan be as various and as devastating as the sin of pride . My brother , turning sixteen then , was alone , and in torment , and in love . He sang , he had to sing , as though music could really accomplish the miracle of making the walls come tumbling down . He sang : as Julia abandoned her ministry , Arthur began to discover his . But the song which transformed others failed to transform him . His principal impression of Washington , then , was that it was , itself , the most arrogant and hideous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Frenchman . Whoever designed it had failed to see the future . Much later , Arthur returned to Washington , with me , on a civil rights tour . After we left the Lincoln Memorial , Arthurdrove us through the city and we stopped for a moment before the desolate hotel in which he and Crunch had lived , under the roof  --  where , dripping with sweat , they had put their mattresses on the floor , beneath the open window , and , in the still , stale , humid air , made love . Crunch and Arthur had been in New York about five or six days when Crunch ran into Julia . It was a Saturday , at dusk , on 125th Street . He had just crossed Seventh Avenue , and was heading toward Lenox and the subway . As always on Saturday evenings , the street was full of people , full of good-natured noise ; it sounded good-natured , anyway , until and unless you had a reason to listen to it carefully . There were the stores on either side of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There seemed to be children on this street at almost any hour  --  running from , or to , a spanking , one hoped . Matrons walked with a stolid authority , rarely looking in the store windows , headed directlytoward whatever they were going to buy ; their demeanorindicated that they would never buy anything upp230here , if they could help it . Boys and girls together walked more slowly , pausing to look in the windows  --  nudging each other , pointing , laughing , walking on  --  as did the young girls , who were generally noisier , walking in twos and threes . It was warm , and the clothes the people wore made them seem colorful and friendly . A very handsome , very dark girl , wearing a yellow sweater and bright red slacks came out of a store entrance , carrying a box ; and Crunch slowed his stride a little , and turned his head , giving the girl an admiring look . Thus he bumped into someone , a girl  --  he was aware only of huge eyes in a gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kept walking  --  and then stopped and turned around . The girl had stopped , too , and was staring at him . It was Julia . Yet it scarcely seemed to be Julia . In the dusk , which was lighted by streetlamps and storewindows and in which people were moving , restlessly and relentlessly , all around him , Crunch almost felt that he was standing in a dream . Julia stood very straight and still  --  her face opened in the smile he remembered . Yet it did not seem to be Julia . He moved , and put both hands on her shoulders . " Sister Julia ! How are you , child ? " " I ca n't complain , Crunch . I 'm still alive . " But a short time ago , she would have said , I praise the Lord for His keeping power , and it would not have occurred to Crunch to put his hands on her shoulders . He felt lost . He took his hands away , and put them in his pockets . " I was mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother . " " Yes , " said Julia . " She 's gone , and I miss her . " But this is n't Julia ! Julia would have said , Yes . The Lord has taken her home , to be with Him in glory . Blessed be the name of the Lord . Crunch felt more and more frightened , he did not know why . " And how 's little Jimmy ? And  --  and your father ? " She was all in black ; but she seemed , somehow , to bep231dressed differently than usual . She was wearing high heels . He wondered if she was really wearing a little makeup  --  he did n't trust his eyes . Her thick , black hair was arranged differently , he could hardly have said how , but it made him aware of her forehead . Her hair seemed to give off a strange , dry , acrid odor , an odor he associated with old age and dying . But she , suddenly , had no age . Something happened behind her eyes , something unreadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , little Jimmy 's been taken out of harm 's way , he 's down in New Orleans , with his grandmother . And my father " she smiled , briefly , shrugged , and said  --  " he 's just the same . " " You still at the same place ? " " Yes , " said Julia . " Just him and me . " She looked at Crunch , her eyes larger and darker than ever . " It would be nice if you could drop by and see us  --  you , and Arthur and Red and Peanut . How are they ? " Crunch was meeting Arthur on Fourteenth Street . He said , " They 're all fine . " " And how did the summer go ? " " It went all right  --  it went good , I 'd say . But now  --  " He paused . He really hated to talk about it . " Now what ? " They had moved to the edge of the sidewalk , to be out of the way of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . She was terribly thin . She was wearing a little makeup . Her lips trembled a little when she spoke , and so did her voice , and a pulse kept beating on one side of her neck . She was unbelievably unhappy . Her unhappinesswas as real as an odor . He said , " Well , Uncle Sam 's inviting us all to a party in Korea , and I expect we 'll all be leaving soon  --  all except Arthur . He 's too young . Thank God . " She heard the intensity of his " thank God " and looked at him with a quickened sympathy . He was grateful for this ; it eased him a little , almost as though he had made a confession.  |p232But  she did not , herself , make any reference to God . She said , " I 'd love to see Arthur . He was so nice about singing at Sister Bessie 's funeral . " Then , lamely , as though catching her breath and holding back panic , " If you all have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she laughed  --  " you know my father 's always happy to offer folks a glass of wine ! " When she laughed , something strange happened between them , almost as though she had made a confession . Crunch grinned , feeling very strangely moved . " Well , I 'm going to try to get by to see you , Sister Julia . And you give your father my regards . " " Thank you , Crunch , " she said . " Be seeing you . " He had been waiting to hear her say , Praise the Lord ! but she smiled and waved her hand and turned away . He watched her curiously hesitant progress through the crowd . People turned to look at her  --  this tall , thin , burning girl , dressed all in black , just out of the madhouse , or on her way . Crunch watched her , and watched the people watching her , and he almost started to call her back . Call her back to what ? He turned , and got to the corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two minds as concerned seeing her again  --  seeingwho again ? For the girl he had just left was a stranger to him ; and there was no reason , really , for him to want to know her ; he had certainly never wanted to know her before . Something had happened in her life , but he did not really want to know what had happened . It had nothing to do with him ; he was happy as he was . He knew , one day , he would have a girl again , but it would certainly not be this girl . He and Arthur were happy now , as they were , and when the time came for Crunch to have a girl again , well , that would be time enough . He mentioned to Arthur that he had seen Julia , and that she looked strange . Arthur said that this was probably because she had stopped preaching  --  he knew this from hisp233mother  --  and no one knew what she was doing with herself . Florence suspected the truth , but it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she mentioned it to no one , not even Paul . But she told Arthur that the girl needed to see people her own age  --  that , though it was very good of her to devote herself to her widowed father ( so Florence put it ) , it was n't fair : and so she hoped that Crunch and Arthur would " keep an eye out " for her . " You and Crunch go on up there and just sort of look around and let me know  --  you know  --  what it feels like . " Arthur felt somewhat ambivalent about being assigned the role of a spy , even though this role was being given him by his mother . " Ca n't Daddy go ? " " Your daddy 's not been able to get Joel alone since the funeral . Only times he sees Joel is when he 's drunk  --  and then , he wo n't look nobody in the eye . " So , late on a Sunday afternoon , Crunch and Arthur climbed the brownstone steps , and rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Crunch had scarcely been able to recognize Julia , something like two weeks before , because she had changed . But Brother Joel Miller was a far greater shock , because he had not changed . He was absolutely recognizable , as though nothing had happened , no time had passed . His hair gleamed , freshly combed ; he smelt of after-shave lotion . He had been interrupted while tucking a white shirt into his navy-blue pants . His black pumps gleamed . He had not yet put the cufflinks into the cuffs of his sleeves ; the sleeves were rolled , lightly , to just below the elbow . The fingernails had not yet been buffed to their highest sheen . He stared at them blankly , with a blank hostility . Arthur said , " Good evening , Brother Miller . Is Julia home ? " He recognized Arthur 's voice before he recognized Ar/thur . When he recognized Arthur , he recognized Crunch . But he remained in the doorway , like someone with his back to the wall . Then he moved to allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good evening , young gentlemen , " he said . " Yes , I believeshe 's home . Come in . " They walked into the dark , still hallway , and followed Brother Miller to the living room . " She may be sleeping , " said Brother Miller . " I 'll go wake her up . Excuse me , " and he left the room . They heard him climbing the stairs . They looked at each other , and " Damn ! " Crunch said . " He did n't even offer us no wine . " But Arthur thought how strange it was that Julia should be at home , sleeping , on a Sunday afternoon , with all those souls outside , waiting to be saved . He remembered the last time he had seen her ; he wondered what had happened to her to change her so ; he wondered what he would see when she walked into the room . He realized that he did not want to see her . They heard voices above them , and footsteps . They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voices were too low for them to be able to understand anything . The low voices contained a disquieting , hostile heat , were not meant to be understood by others . " We wo n't stay long , " Arthur said . " It 's just that I promisedmy mother . " " Well , I promised , too , little fellow , " Crunch said . " You not mad at me ? " " Mad at you ? for what ? " " For messing up your Sunday . " Crunch growled at him , licked his lips , and grinned . " But my Sunday ai n't messed up . Yet . " The voices ceased , they heard Brother Miller descending the stairs , he entered the room . " She 'll be with you in a few minutes , " he said . He said this as he had always said it : like a privileged person conferringa favor.  |p235Yet  , as though some explanation would not compromise either his daughter 's dignity , or his own , he added , " Julia took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up and go on about her duties , but I have to hold her back and make her rest . I done lost a wife , I do n't want to lose a daughter  --  she 's all I got , now . " He walked to the kitchen door . " You boys like a little refreshment while you waiting ? All I got is a little wine . " He grinned at Arthur . " Your mama let you drink wine yet ? " " A little bit , sometimes , " Arthur said  --  which was true enough . " I reckon you big enough , " said Joel , and disappeared into the kitchen . They heard water running in the kitchen , and then Joel reappeared with three glasses and a half bottle of white wine . He poured their glasses , left the bottle on the table in front of the sofa . " To your health , " he said , and they sipped the wine , which was thick and sweet . " Julia sure ai n't the housekeeper her mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't really much more than a girl yet , we all tend to forget that , she always been so grown-up . " He sat down on the chair facing the sofa . " Julia tells me you all was on the road this summer , singing down South . How 'd you all do ? " " Pretty well , " Crunch said . He looked at Arthur . " Good , I 'd say . " " Yeah , " said Arthur . " We did very well . " " Which cities was the best ? " " Nashville , Atlanta  --  " Crunch said . " Birmingham , too , " said Arthur . " What about New Orleans ? " " New Orleans was good , " said Crunch . " Reason I asked  --  little Jimmy 's down there with his grandmother , and Julia wants to see him real bad . That might be just the thing to start her off again  --  do a string of Southern churches , starting in New Orleans . " He sipped his wine , pursed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you boys singing , Julia preaching  --  what do you think ? I think we could clean up . "  |p236Crunch  sighed . " It might be a good idea  --  but we ai n't going to be able to do it . " " Why not ? " " I 'm about to be drafted  --  I 'm just waiting for the datewhen I have to , you know , say good-bye to you all . " Joel sucked his teeth . " Yeah . The others , too of course . " " Everybody . Except Arthur . " Joel turned to Arthur . " That 's right . Well , what about you and Julia  --  " but , at this moment , Julia entered the room . Her head was covered with a green bandanna , and she wore a chocolate-colored , tight-fitting dress . She carried a small green pocketbook , and wore high-heeled beige shoes . For both Arthur and Crunch , though for different reasons , a total stranger had entered the room . Julia was so thin that the tight-fitting dress could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but that was striking and attractive enough . She barely escaped looking like a little girl dressed up in her older sister 's clothes . She escapedthis by wearing no makeup : her face was ruthlessly , defiantly scrubbed , and she turned it first to her father . " My Sunday best , " she said mockingly , then turned her enormous eyes on Crunch , then Arthur . She went to Arthurand hugged him : involuntarily , he stiffened . " I 'm so glad to see you , " she said  --  but he felt that she was speaking to Crunch . " How are you ? " Arthur asked , finally managing to smile . " I 'm glad to see you , too . " " I 'm fine , " she said . " I 'm trying . " She sat down on the edge of the sofa . " But I 'm not allowed to drink yet . " Crunch and Arthur sat down , too , Arthur somewhat more abruptly than Crunch , and Joel said , in a tone that almost made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Girl gets like that sometimes , do n't mind her . She 's just trying to drive her daddy crazy . " " I am not , " said Julia , laughing . " I 'm just trying not to drive myself crazy . " She looked at Arthur again . " How 've you been ? Tell me something  --  " and he still felt that she was speaking to Crunch.  |p237She  reminded him , abruptly , of Sister Dorothy Green , and he could scarcely catch his breath to answer . Sister , he started to say , but the word simply weighed down the edge of his tongue , like a heavy pellet , Sister Julia . He said lightly , " You tell me something , I ai n't got nothing to tell . Crunch already told you  --  we worked all summer . It was good for us . " He was aware of Brother Joel Miller 's eyes . " But now , everybody 's going to be kind of scattered  --  so  --  " He looked down . Pain hit him a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist , and the touch made him dizzy . " I 'll be all alone , " he said . " I guess that 's all the something I got to tell you . " " But you and Julia , " Joel said . " You make a mighty good team . You ought to think about it , you ai n't got to be all alone . " Julia and Arthur looked at each other for the very first time . Neither of them knew anything about the other  --  for the very first time , they wondered ; and Arthur realized that if Julia had changed , so had he changed . He wondered if his change was visible . And then he wondered what had changed Julia . He was in love , in love with the man who sat beside him . He knew that this could not be said : but this was what had changed him . What had changed Julia ? The death of her mother ? But he knew that it could not have been only the death of her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt Crunch beside him , sniffing down the same path . Then terror overtook him , like a cloud , like thunder , like the water coming over one 's head , and he held his breath , paralyzed , staring at the girl  --  staring , in a way , into his mirror . Julia turned to her father and said , " If Arthur wants to try to sing with me , we can do that . " She grinned and turned to Arthur . " If your daddy will let us use his piano . " She said to Crunch , and to Arthur , and to her father , " I 'm not going to preach no more . " A silence fell in the room , a silence as black as her father 's eyes.  | " Why ? " Crunch asked . He had leaned forward , his hands stretched , unconsciously , toward Julia . " Because , " she said , " I 'm ignorant . I do n't know how to save nobody 's soul . I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preacher says , " Crunch said . " The preacher may know it , " Julia said , " but he do n't say it . Not in the pulpit , he do n't  --  he ca n't ! How can you say that to all them souls looking to you for salvation ? " " She 'll be all right , " Joel said . " She 's mighty upset now  --  she 'll be all right . " Julia touched her green bandanna . In the barely controlledtrembling of that child 's hand , Arthur saw , unwillingly , the terrified intransigence which is the key to beauty . It made her a stranger . It made him want to be her friend . Her anguish made her real . It uncovered her youth . It revealedher age . She dropped her hand , and grinned at Crunch , and Arthur . " Daddy 's right . He 's always right  --  about his daughter . And I love my daddy  --  I always will . But I 'm right , too  --  about his daughter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These gentlemen going to walk me around the block and buy me a ice cream cone . Do n't you tarry too late . " She kissed his damp forehead . Crunch and Arthur stood when Julia stood , and Crunch threw Arthur a worried look  --  his Sunday might be messed up , after all . " We wo n't keep her long , " Arthur said quickly . " Me and Crunch got business downtown  --  but we 'll be back to see you real soon ! " " Certainly before I leave here , " Crunch said . Julia had walked the hallway , to the door , and Crunch and Arthur followed her . Joel rose , and walked behind them . " I 'll wait here then , " he said to Julia , " till you come back . " " All right , Daddy , " Julia said . " Suit yourself . " She opened the door . Crunch and Julia started down the steps . Arthur , turning to close the door behind them , saw Brotherp239Miller , his shirt-sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur said , " Good night , Brother Miller , " but Joel did not answer . Arthur closed the door , and started down the steps . Crunch and Julia were standing on the sidewalk , looking up at him , and  --  Arthur told me later  --  this was a very strange moment in his life , less than a split second perhaps , but never to be forgotten , a moment occurring outside of time . He was abruptly aware that he was standing on a height , and , he told me , " They were looking up at me like I had seen something . I had n't yet started down the steps . She was as skinny as she could be , looking up at me , and Crunch was looking up at me , too . Crunch was lean , but he was n't skinny  --  you know , brother , I had held him in my arms , and I knew . And  --  how I loved him ! Maybe that 's what happened as I started down those steps . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me and Crunch  --  I thought I knew . I did n't know . I know I did n't know why they looked at me that way , when I come stumbling down those steps . They looked at me like I was some kind of messenger  --  of salvation . " His voice , in my memory , drops , then rises  --  and I , too , can see the children , Crunch and Julia , standing on the sidewalk , looking up at the child  --  in the busy , funky , endof-summerstreets . And I am sure that he did resemble " some kind of messenger  --  ofsalvation . " He was certainly that for Crunch . Julia 's eyes followed Crunch 's eyes , simply , and her need was so great that she saw what Crunch saw  --  without knowing that she saw it , and with nothing whatever having yet occurred between herself and Crunch . Her eyes followedCrunch 's eyes because , otherwise , her eyes were fixed on madness , on despair , on death . She wanted to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could . It seemed to her that she had promised her mother to take care of herp240brother : that was the only reason that she had to live . But it was not enough . She did not see how to get beyond her fatherto her brother  --  she needed a human hand to help her lift herself over the chasm . And Crunch was there , with his hand outstretched , although he did not know it . And there was Arthur , too , with his hand outstretched , although he did not know it , because of his love for Crunch . And Arthur looked , too , at that moment in his life , like archaic , distant portraits of young nobles , princes , Greeks , Turks , Ethiopians , some of the faces in Vandyke : with all that carefully piled , wavy hair , that brow , those eyes and nostrils , those firm and greedy lips , the big , wide , humorousmouth . He caught all the light on the street at that moment , coming down the steps , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his happiness and his sorrow all interwoven and fashioned together and billowing around him like a splendid royal robe . And what he glimpsed , at that moment , in their eyes , as he came down those steps , was a future , greater height , and a longer , slower descent . Then he was on the sidewalk , beside them . He had troublelooking at Julia because he had trouble recognizing her : she grinned , and he grinned , too . Julia took Crunch by one arm and took Arthur by the other , and they turned and started down the block . " You do n't really have to buy me no ice cream cone , " Julia said . " I just wanted to get out of the house for a min-ute . " " But we ready , " said Crunch , " and willing and  --  able , I believe , " and he grinned , around Julia 's shoulder , at Arthur . " The train , " said Arthur , " is in the station "  --  feeling very proud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cat . Sidney was not there , he was up at Aunt Josephine 's , with Martha . Crunch , Julia , and Arthur crossed the street , and started down the avenue.  | " You all got business downtown , " Julia said . " I 'll walk you to the subway . " " And , then , what you going to do ? " Crunch asked . " Why then , " said Julia , " I 'll walk back home . " " What you doing with yourself these days ? " Crunch asked . " I guess you could say I 'm taking care of my father . " Julia laughed , then she coughed . " He took my mother 's passing very hard . " " That 's only natural , " Arthur said  --  and then , for some reason , wished that he had not spoken . " Yeah , " said Crunch . " But you ca n't take care of your fatherforever . " " You take care of your mother , " Arthur said , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do what we have to do , " Julia said . " But what about your life ? " Crunch asked . He sounded both angry and bewildered , and Arthur longed to reach out , and touch him . " This is my life , " said Julia . " Right now . " They walked in silence for a while , down the broad , amazing , familiar avenue . Julia 's hand trembled slightly on Arthur 's elbow , but it was a firm hand , and she did not stumble . She seemed to know their destination better than he or Crunch knew : it was she who set the pace . She turned to Crunch . " So , " she said , " you 're going away from us ! Are you glad ? " " I ai n't no soldier , " Crunch said  --  and then , after a moment , catching his breath , " No , Julia , I ca n't hardly say I 'm glad . " Julia 's high heels seemed to hit the pavement like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur felt a roaring behind his eyebrows , in his skull . The click-clack of the narrow high heels and the sh'm 'm of the crepe soles made the avenue shake beneath him . All the lights of the avenue wavered , he could scarcely see the people , he held himself upright against Julia 's hand at his elbow.  | " I 'd be glad , " said Julia , " to get away from here . " " Away , " said Crunch , looking straight ahead , " from everyoneyou love ? " " There 's nobody here I love , " said Julia , " since my mama died . If I was old enough , I swear , I 'd go and get my brother and bring him back here and try to raise him  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't want him down South , all by him-self ! " " But he 's not all by himself , " said Arthur . " He 's with his grandmother . " But , as he said this , he remembered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South ; he remembered Peanut 's relatives , in Charlotte ; and he knew that neither did he want to leave anyone he loved down South . He could not have left Crunch down South : he would never have been able to sleep again . Sleep ? He would not be walking . As though this terror had been conveyed through his elbow to Julia 's hand , her hand tightened . " He does n't know his grandmother , " Julia said . Something had been nagging Arthur , and now , he spoke . " What about your father ? Do n't tell us , now , that you do n't love your father ! " The moment the words were out of his mouth , Arthur wished , again , that he had held his peace . Julia said nothing . They kept walking . " You see my father , " Julia said finally , " do n't care how much I may love him , ai n't but so much I can do for him . But little Jimmy  --  that 's something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , and he dared not look at her . She raised her head and said , " Well , here we are , at the subway ! " and gestured toward the kiosk as though she had invented it . Then they all stopped , in a silence charged and awkward . Too much had been said , too little revealed  --  or : too much had been revealed from what little had been said . They did not , any longer , know where they were . Well . They were at the subway station , standing in a light which came from below . Julia walked them to the steps.  | " Well , gentlemen , " said Julia . " I 'm mighty glad I saw you ! When we going to see each other again ? " " Before I go away from here , " said Crunch . " I promise you . " Arthur , but in a very strange way , was mightily relieved that he and Crunch had maneuvered themselves all the way through Sunday , to their Sunday  --  Crunch 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last Sunday they might ever have . But he felt Julia pulling , pulling , against their departure , against their descent of the stairs . He knew that she had nowhere to go , that she would come with them , wherever they were going . If it had not been so nearly their last day together , if they had had time to spare , he and Crunch might have exchanged a brief , secret signal and invited the child to the movies . But  --  they had no time ; too much had been said , too little revealed ; or , what had been revealed , much or little , implied a pursuit , the beginning of a journey , which could not be begun at this moment . Yet something had begun , something had been profoundly altered , and Arthur saw this in Crunch 's troubled , in Julia 's fevered , eyes . " That 's one promise he 'll keep , " Arthur said . " I promise you . " " Can you ? You two as close as that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each heard the other , looked at each other in wonder , and began to laugh . Julia put her hands on her hips , and laughed with them . " Go on , you two , " she said . " Get on down them steps . The both of you  --  you know ?  --  you remind me of my brother . " She sobered without becoming somber . She looked happy , and amused , and Arthur was glad that he and Crunch had made the visit . In her freedom , at that moment , at the top of the stairs , he dimly sensed the beginning of a journey which would forever include Julia . They were little children no longer : they were getting on board the train . Which they now heard , roaring into the station , beneath them . Arthur and Crunch waved , and Julia waved , Arthur and Crunch ran down the steps.  |p244Julia  watched them a moment , then started home . Home was not the place she wanted to go , or to be : but she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dreaded getting there . She walked slowly because she was controlled by the attention of the men and the boys on the avenue . She walked with a slow , long-legged stride , lightly swingingher handbag : she was a powerful incitement , and a mystery . She walked as though she did not see the people that she passed , and she did n't  --  she was burning , burning , and this was why the men and the boys were compelled to watch her pass . It was impossible to know if she were a dressed-up child , or a yearning , burning woman . She had breasts  --  tiny , pin-pointed , narrow ; she had a barely discernible and tantalizing behind . The key , the secret , was in that slow walk , those long legs . Julia sensed , in herself , a power , which , however , and even before she had begun to live ! might already have begun to destroy her . She was searching , searching  --  one may say that she was lost and as only those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in Ezekiel 's valley , alone : oh , Lord , can these bones live ? That was the way she walked , although she did not know it , and that was why she tantalized every eye . Her burning created a burning , that was why she walked so slowly . It was the only human attention she had ever had . And now  --  she walked the long , broad , familiar , amazing avenue , and got home . Joel was in his shirt-sleeves , on the sofa . " You ai n't gone out yet ? " " Told you I was going to wait for you , daughter . " Then , " Seems like that 's all I ever do , these days . " She threw down her handbag  --  on the sofa , next to him  --  and waited . She folded her arms over her breasts , as she had sometimes seen her mother fold her arms . She began to pace , as she had sometimes seen her mother pace  --  looking straight ahead , seeing nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . There 's African girls get marriedat fourteen . She looked at her father.  |p245She  thought of her brother . " I did n't ask you to wait for me . I do n't want you to wait for me . What you waiting for me for ? " " You all I got . " It was Sunday night . He would go out  --  she hoped he would go out . She hoped he would go out and pick up some woman and never come back . He would go out . He would come back drunk . He would fall into her bed , smotheringher with his breath ; his tears would burn her face . She would endure the touch she dreaded , and to which she had become addicted , feeling like something struggling at the bottom of the sea . Her days and nights were drugged . With all her heart , she wanted to flee  --  she could not move . " If I 'm all you got , " she said , " you in a mighty sorry condition . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to get something . And you know you are . Are you just going to sit here and let us be over-taken ? " She had a job scrubbing floors after school , and she gave him almost all the money that she made , which was n't much . He had had to pawn his favorite pair of cufflinks . She was sitting still , watching everything crumble , and disappear ; and yet , she knew she had to move . " No , " she said . He had hated pawning his cufflinks , which had been a gift from her , and she had felt very sorry for him . She had nothing against him , nothing , either because she did not expect him to be other than he was , or because she was too beaten . She had to move , and yet , she waited . Though she had nothing against him , sometimes , nevertheless , she waited for revenge . Sometimes she hoped his touch would undo the horror of his touch . " What you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Time ? The world ai n't got that kind of time . " She wanted to get to New Orleans , but not as a beggar . She had to arrive with something , with something for Jimmy right away , something to make him trust her.  |p246But  she did not want to leave her father with nothing . He had dried her tears and stroked her and wiped away the blood  --  she had screamed when she saw the blood . She had wanted to run out of the house , but she had been shivering , trembling , screaming , the wound between her legs would not let her move , her legs would not carry her . She had forced herself to stop screaming because , if not , they would come and take her father away : they had become accomplices . " I been patient awhile , " he said . " Do n't make me lose my patience . " " What will you do if you lose your patience ? " she asked  --  and immediately wished that she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood up , and she was terrified . " Just do n't you make me lose it , that 's all , " he said . " You wo n't like it , I guarantee you . " They stared at each other . " Why you talking to me like that ? " " Because I 'm tired of the way you mope around this house , looking like the Book of Job , and looking at me like I was some kind of reptile ! " She sat down in the easy chair , and he came and stood over her , leaning on the arms of the chair . " What 's between you and me happens , happens all the time  --  this ai n't the last time or the first time or the only time . I just ai n't being a hypocrite about it  --  that 's all . And you did n't call no cops on your daddy , did you ? And you ai n't going to , neither . All little girls wants their daddy  --  everybody knows that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted . That 's why you still here  --  I hear the way you call me Daddy ! " It was true  --  she became more terrified than ever , and said nothing . She murmured Daddy as he pounded into her , as she felt him shoot his semen into her : she was pleased to give him pleasure . His pleasure was overwhelming and terrifying , she could scarcely bear it , his pleasure left her alone in some dreadful place , and yet , something in her wasp247pleased to give him pleasure . With all her heart , she wanted to flee  --  she could not move . She could not move and yet , she knew she must . Soon it would be too late , she would begin to die . " Am I telling the truth , or not ? " She stared at him . " Do n't look at me like that ! Am I telling the truth , or not ? " " I guess so , " she said , after a moment . " You guess so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away toward the hall , and his face changed again , becoming gentle and wistful . " Snap out of it , Julia  --  for me ? Ca n't you do that for me ? We can be real good friends , we can have wonderful times together . " He came back to the chair , and leaned over her , again . " We love each other , well , let 's just love each other . We doing any harm to anybody ? " No , you 're just killing me , that 's all , but she said , " No , Daddy . " " I love you , " he said . " You all I got . " He kissed her on the forehead  --  she went numb with the shudder she did not want him to feel . " All right ? " " All right , " she said . He leaned up again , at last , and moved away . " You think about what I said . I 'll see you later . " And she listened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Crunch , as good as his word , came by to see her in the late afternoon , three or four days later . It was a day both bright and sullen , with the gray sky veiling a glaring sun  --  as she was to remember years and years later , as she remembers now . Joel was at work on his " little piece of a job , " as he put it , and she had just come in from her job in The Bronx , had not been home five minutes : by just that narrow a margin , she barely missed what seemed , then , like salvation . The bright and sullen day hinted of the coming fall , thep248coming winter , and Crunch was wearing a gray turtleneck sweater and green corduroy pants . Her heart lifted up when she opened the door and found him standing on the steps , and she laughed . " Well , hello there ! You all alone ? " " Sure am , Sister Julia . How are you ? " " I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock to see you without your shadow  --  people ca n't get used to it . " They closed the door behind them , and walked into the living room . " They going to have to get used to it  --  me and Arthur going to have to get used to it , too . He got a rehearsal someplaceand I had to run a errand for my mama , right around the corner  --  and  --  so -- here I am . " " And I 'm glad to see you . Can I get you something ? Would you like a glass of wine ? "  --  they both laughed  --  " or would you prefer beer ? That 's all we got , I think . " " Beer , please , " said Crunch , and sat down while Julia went into the kitchen . " What you been doing ? " she called . " Working . Waiting . Sure wish I did n't have to go . " She came back with the beer and carefully poured it and handed it to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unexpected , began to flow between them and Crunch carefully crossed his legs and sipped his beer . " So ? What you been doing ? " he asked , bewildered , uneasy , and suddenly excited , not quite looking her in the eye . " Nothing . Staying here with my daddy , and going crazy . " She looked him in the eye more and more insistently  --  she could not help it  --  and more and more candidly , moving , now that she was moving , very fast , and frightened to death . Her heart hammered , her breasts rose and fell . She knew that he could not keep his eyes off her breasts . She was wearing a tight white blouse and a black skirt . " Where 's your daddy ? "  | " He 's at work . He wo n't be back till after dark  --  he might not be back then , " and she laughed a laugh which suddenly died , and neither of them , for a moment , could think of anything to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does your father do ? " " He got a job in some kind of factory  --  downtown , near Fourteenth Street . " " Oh ? I got me a little furnished room down off Fourteenthand Third . " " You do ? Oh , Crunch , I sure wish you 'd take me with you down there one day ! " He grinned an awkward grin . " You want to see my room ? " " Yes . Yes . I do . " " It ai n't nothing to see . It 's just a room . " " But it 's your room . I wish I had a room . I 've got to get a room somewhere . My father 's going to drive me crazy if I do n't get out of here ! " " Sister Julia ! " " He is ! he is ! I do n't know what to do ! " She shuddered and began to cry and Crunch , in misery , put his beer on the table and clasped his hands together , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Julia muttered , " I ca n't tell you , oh , but I got to tell somebody . " She beat on her thighs , and stood up . " I need somebody to help me . " " Julia  --  if there 's anything I can do  --  " " Take me ! Take me ! Take me to your room , before it 's too late ! " He did not know how to comfort her , he did not know what to say . He did not know what she was talking about , but a great , dreadful , silent suspicion began to gather inside him . " It ca n't  --  it ca n't , " he said stupidly , " be that bad . " He stood up and moved toward her . He did not want to touch her , did not dare . He felt a terrible , terrible pity for her , and , at the same time , he wanted to run . " Come , " he said . " Sit down , " and touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , but her tears still fell . She sat down . Crunch was trembling ; he remained standing . She looked up at him . " I 'm so glad you came , " she said . " You do n't know how much I need a friend . " " Well , then , " he said , smiling , " you got a friend . " " You do n't know , " she said , " how much I wanted to see you , how many times I 've thought of you . " " Of me ? Why me ? " " Lying next to my daddy , listening to him snore , " she said . " I thought of you , oh , how I wished it was you ! " Her tears began to fall again . He stared at her stupidly , saying nothing . " Do n't look at me like that , " she said . " It was n't my fault , I swear it was n't my fault , please be my friend . " " Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , you hear ? It was n't his fault , either , he ca n't help it ! " " Your father  --  ? " He felt that he was about to throw up . " Yes . My father . He says it happens all the time . " She looked up at him . " Does it ? " " I would n't know , " he said  --  feeling colder and colder . She looked into his face as though she would never see it again , then rose and moved to the window . He was about to find a way of saying good-bye , of getting out of this house . He watched her frail shoulders , her fragile neck . " Well . I guess it 's all over for me then , " she said . And his heart turned over . He moved , and took her by the shoulders and turned her to face him . " Do n't think like that , " he said . " Do n't think like that . Nothing 's over . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt her trembling at his words , at his touch , and felt himself begin to tremble with pity and desire , and with fear . He could not catch his breath . She moved , and buried her face in his chest . He put his arms around her , then she moved again and held him close . " Oh , Crunch , " she whispered . " Please make me well . Please touch me  --  take me  --  make me well.  |p251He  tried to pull away , with a little smile . He said , " You 're just a little girl , Julia . " She looked up at him . " No , I 'm not , " she said . " Oh , no , I 'm not . " She touched her lips to his lips . Slowly , slowly , he pressed her closer to him , he gave her his lips , his tongue  --  involuntarily , as it were , tentatively : but pity and desire rose , driving , he could not pull back . " You 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , I 'm sure . " She placed one of his hands on her breasts , her own hands , as though she were blind , stroked his face , discoveringit , his back , his buttocks , her hands ran up and down his thighs . She unhooked her skirt and stepped out of it ; she ran her hands under his sweater , under his T-shirt , she stroked his skin . " Your father , " he whispered . " Your father  --  " " He wo n't be coming home . He never comes home before night . " He took off his sweater , worried , but , too late to worry now , and she stripped herself naked and came , helplessly trusting , back into his arms . He felt at once helpless and helplessly powerful : he could not refuse her . She unbuckled his belt , he let his pants fall to the floor . Her body , now , again as though she were blind , strained against his body , discovering it . He let her have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if she really knew what she wanted , he was afraid he would hurt her ; but she put her hand on him and looked up at him with eyes which held neither fear , nor the fear of pain . She pulled him down with her to the floor and , very , very slowly , he entered her  --  she holding him close , sweating , straining to take it all , as he grew larger and larger , and , though still trying to be gentle , thrust harder and harder . She thrust to meet him , with astonishing strength , smiling and calling his name over and over . The sullen daylight beat down on his back , something moved in the body beneath him like waves ris/ing and breaking , she seemed to sing his name . He wanted to whisper a warning about having a baby and thought to pull out , but she held him to her with all her force and he suddenly seemed to have plunged even deeper into her and , soon , it would be too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no words came , only Julia . Oh Julia . She murmuredhis name again with an unbelievable exultation , he pulled up , thrust down again and again , harder and harder and deeper and deeper , she laughing and crying and calling his name and pulling him always deeper into her  --  almost as though his lunging body would touch and open and drench and heal her soul . He , as it were , prayed with her , longing to give her all that she needed , and yet holding back , the unbelievable delight and agony tormenting , finally , the very tip of his congested sex , boiling there for an eternity , boiling , boiling , he groaned , hiding his face in her neck , and , finally , what seemed like a single drop forced itselfout , he was utterly helpless in her arms , and , at last , the wave broke , pounding him full force into her , and she murmuredhis name , like a song . He opened his eyes . He began , slowly , to soften inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , more peacefulthan he had ever seen them , wet , and full of wonder . " How do you feel ? " he asked her . " Saved , " she said , and smiled . " How do you feel ? " " Beautiful , " he said , and grinned  --  but he had just thought of Arthur . He raised himself up , and pulled out of her . " Let 's get dressed and get out of here . I 'm still afraid your father might come home . " She kissed him , then stood up , picking up her clothes . " I wo n't be a minute , " she said . She started for the steps . " There 's a bathroom right here , Crunch , " and she pointed . " I 'll be right down . " She ran , lightly , up the steps . Crunch pulled up his pants , picked up his sweater and walked to the bathroom , breathing as though he had just run a race , with his knees shaking . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror could tellp253him what had happened . Physically , what had happened was more familiar to him than his affair with Arthur  --  but only physically . And he did not feel , now , as he had so often , the humiliation and revulsion of having been used . He felt exhausted and bewildered  --  he would have to have it out with Julia . Then he thought of her father and felt a terrible pity for Julia ; a pity sharpened by his knowledge that his pity was not his love . Then he wondered if he should tell Arthur . He bowed his head , and washed his face . Julia stood naked in the upstairs bathroom , and looked at her body and looked at her body and looked at her body and touched it with wonder , and , for the first time , without shame or fear . What her father had stolen from her , Crunch had given back . She was fourteen : suddenly , she was only fourteen . When she came down , Crunch had helped himself to anotherbeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out before him , arms loosely folded , holding his beer in his right hand , head bent slightly , eyes raised , looking straight ahead . He did not seem to hear her , at first ; then he turned and looked at her , and grinned , and gave a long , low whistle . She was wearing a green halter and green slacks and nondescriptloafers and had arranged her hair in a ponytail which was controlled by the green bandanna . Her slacks had pockets ; she carried no handbag . " Do I look all right ? " " I can tell you ai n't no preacher . " They both laughed , and he stood up , placing his beer on the table . " Finish your beer , " she said . He finished his beer in one swallow and put the glass back on the table . She picked it up , carried it to the kitchen and rinsed it , dried it , and put it back in the cupboard . He watched her from the kitchen doorway , his eyebrow cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Yes . Where we going ? You going to take me to see your room ? " " Not today , Julia . I got to stop by Arthur 's . You want to come with me ? " " Oh  --  Arthur . Sure . " Then , " Is it all right if I come ? " He laughed . " You 've known Arthur just about all your life . What kind of question is that ? " " Oh "  --  she laughed , looking confused ; but this did not dim her radiance . " I just thought , if you wanted to talk  --  " " His mama 's going to be there , his papa , too , I reckon . We 'll talk . Come on . " " Crunch "  --  she ran to him , and kissed him . " I 'm so happy . " He put his hands on her shoulders , and kissed her on the forehead , stepped back . " Come on . Let 's hit the streets . " They walked the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . In my pocket . " She grinned up at him , he opened the door , watching her utterly transformed face . They entered the paradoxical day , and started down the steps . She put her arm in his , as trustingas a baby . He was aware that she had never walked down the streets like this with anyone , in all her life : he was the first . And she was happy , but he was troubled . He was troubled on many levels , unspeakable , inaccessible : on the simplest level , he began to wonder just what kind of freak he was , what kind of monster found himself involved with two children , one boy and one girl ? For Arthur was not a man yet , and Julia was certainly not a woman . And what was he ? He shook his head , forcing the streets to come back into focus . He looked sideways at Julia , who now had both her arms linked around his one arm , and who was looking at the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she had never seen any of this before . They waited for a light , then crossed a street . He was aware of one thing only , that Arthur 's house was coming closer and closer.  | " You know , Julia , " he said , " I 'm not going to be here long . " She looked up at him , as grave as she had been as a preacher . " Hush , " she said . " I know that . " " Well . But do you know what it means ? " " I know I 'm happy  --  for the first time in my life  --  " " Julia ! I might have to leave here tomorrow morning ! " " But I 'll always , " she said , looking up at the covered sky , " have today ! " Then , she flew down , as it were , from her glorious height and walked again beside him , matching her step to his ; or rather , grateful for her sudden descent , he matched his step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know . We got  --  we ai n't got no time . I got so many things to tell you  --  partly about my father  --  but about so many things  --  about my mother and Jimmy  --  and so many things . About me , when I was a preacher and how I always noticed you  --  oh , " and she laughed , " Arthur 's older brother , what 's his name ? Hall  --  Mister Ha ! I always called him . " She turned her face to his . " But I just do n't want to talk about any of that now  --  not now . You understand ? " " Yes , " he said , finally  --  then , " But what if I have to leave in the morning ? " " I 'll write you , " she said . " But anyway  --  how long we going to stay at Arthur 's house ? Ca n't you take me to your room ? " " Julia "  --  he began to sweat  --  " no . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed . " I know I should n't ask you that  --  that 's none of my business . " " It might be , " he said , and , suddenly , he laughed . A weight dropped from his shoulders , and yet , dark wonder hovered about his head . " I might have things to tell you , too , " he said . " But all right . Not today . " Arthur recognized them from the open window  --  for Crunch was late  --  and did not recognize the girl walking beside Crunch , dressed all in green , in slacks , with a barep256midriff , and wearing lipstick  --  he did not recognize Julia at all . " Here comes Crunch , " he said to Florence , " and he 's got some girl with him . " Florence came to the window and leaned out . " Why , " she cried , " what 's wrong with you , boy ? That ai n't nobody but Julia ! " She waved and called , " Hey , you two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? " " No such thing , " Crunch grinned , looking upward . " No such thing , ma'am . We was just asking for directions . " " Look like you got directed right . Julia , how you been , child ? You come on up here and let me spank that skinny behind of yours ! I declare , the way you been treating me is a shame  --  come on up here now ! " " How 'd your rehearsal go , man ? " Crunch yelled . " Not bad , man . Come on in the house , I 'll tell you about it . " " Well , " said Florence , retreating from the window , " there he is  --  your heart . And Julia , too . That 's beautiful . " It is my impression that the young can not fool anybody , except those people who wish to be fooled . The young tell you what you want to hear , which is how they learn to despise you , and themselves , and this is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case , Arthurnever managed to fool anybody as long as he lived . Now , with his face glowing with a double relief  --  that Crunch had arrived , that the girl was only , after all , Julia  --  and facing his mother , our mother would have had to have been a fool not to have known what Crunch and Arthur meant to each other . Indeed , she very probably knew it before they did . It worried her , yes . It worried her the way the identity , the fate , the future of her child always worried a mother . If I had decided to marry a white girl , for example , my mother would have been worried but would never have opposed it . Her concern was that I marry someoneI loved , who loved me  --  if , for that matter , I ever marriedat all , which was entirely up to me . She was notp257distressed about Arthur until the word was out on Arthur 's ass , and lots of people tried to gang-rape him in indescribableways  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there  --  and Arthurbegan to sink beneath the double weight of the judgment without and the judgment within . And , yet , it is true , and Arthur was right when he insisted , I 've got to live the life I sing about in my song : he meant that he could not afford to live a lie . Ah . But , then , you 've set yourself up for something , inevitably , and this was the nature of Paul 's distress , that he saw the day coming but died before the day arrived , when Arthur would cry out , weeping briny tears , Look ! what they done to my song ! For the rest , a son , or brother , is simply that  --  a son , or a brother  --  and you love him , in the shit or out of the shit , and you clean him up if you have to , and you know he 's got to go the way his blood beats because that 's your blood beating in those veins , too . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence said . " Go open the door for them , Arthur , why you standing there like that ? " Florence went into the kitchen , and Arthur went to open the door . Presently , Julia and Crunch , laughing , huffing and puffingas though they were climbing up the steep side of the mountain , and looking as though they had just had a picnic in Central Park , came up the stairs to the open door , where Arthur stood . " Girl , " Arthur said , grinning , " I did n't recognize ' you at all . I guess you really have stopped preaching . " They kissed each other , and Julia said , " You hush . I just might be studying a brand-new text . " " Sure looks good on you , girl , " Arthur said , and they laughed , and Florence appeared behind Arthur , hands on hips . " Girl ! You want me to beat your behind on the landing or you want to get your behind whipped in this house ? "  | " Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had some hard trials "  --  but Florence pulled her past Arthur and took Julia in her arms . Arthur and Crunch were alone for a second , at the door , on the landing . Crunch suddenly pulled the door shut behindArthur and took him in his arms and kissed him , hard . They held each other a second , pulled away . Crunch opened the door . " Love you , " he whispered . " We 'll take a walk later . I got something to tell you . " " Sure . " He watched Crunch , vaguely disturbed . " Is everythingall right ? " Florence and Julia had gone into the living room ; there was no one on the landing . Crunch put one hand on Arthur'sshoulder . He said solemnly , " No . " " What 's the matter ? " " When I said I love you  --  I did n't hear you say nothing . " Arthur laughed . " You 're crazy , man . " Then he took Crunch 's face in his hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all my heart . " " Then why you standing in the door like that ? Look like you do n't want me in your house . " " Come on in the house , man . I swear , you the craziest motherfucker I know . " " I 'm going to tell your mama what you said ! " Crunch yelled this at the top of his lungs and Arthur collapsed into laughter and slammed the door behind them . " Will you two stop playing the fool ? " Florence cried , " and come on in here ? I do n't , " she said to Julia , " know which of them is worse . " Crunch and Arthur came into the living room , still laughing . Florence and Julia sat on the sofa , side by side . " What was that you was going to tell me ? " " No , Mama Montana , I do n't believe I 'll tell you now . I just leave it between Arthur and the Lord . " He sat down in a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still laughing because it seemed thatp259Crunch could not stop laughing . He had no way of knowing that Crunch 's laughter came out of both panic and relief . Here was Arthur , he had touched him , nothing had changed between them ; he , Crunch , had not changed . He knew , at least for the moment , where he was . So he felt that he could handle whatever was coming . He could tell Arthur the truth : he realized , then , that he could tell Julia the truth . He laughed again , briefly , and sobered . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " but it 's Arthur 's fault . He ought to be on television . " Florence looked , briefly at both of them and then turned back to Julia . " So ? What is your father doing ? " " Oh . He goes to work and he comes home . He do n't say much . " She toyed with the bandanna tied around her ponytail , looked first at Crunch , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with someone who do n't say much . " " And you  --  what are you doing ? " " Oh . Trying to take care of my father . " Crunch and Florence stared at Julia , Arthur stared at Crunch . Julia looked down . " Going to school . And I got a job on Grand Concourse as a kind of scrubwoman , I guess you 'd say , " and she laughed , and looked up . Florence grunted . " What I 'd really like to do is go to New Orleans and get jimmy and bring him back up here , with me  --  but  --  " " Jimmy 's better off where he is , " Florence said . " I do n't like to say it , but you know as well as I do that jimmy and his father ai n't never going to get along . " " I know , " said Julia . " But I was n't going to bring him there . I . want to find another place and take care of him myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ai n't but fourteen , you ca n't take care of yourself , how you think you going to be able to take care of jimmy ? " " I promised my mother , " Julia said . " I promised my mother I would . She did n't want him to go down South , and she did n't want him nowhere near his daddy , neither . " She looked up at Florence , suddenly close to tears , andp260Florence nodded , not looking at Julia , nodded from a long ways off . " I do n't know how I 'm going to do it , but I have to do it , I promised my mother ! " " Well , " said Florence , " we 'll talk . " She put her hand on Julia 's hand . " I think I know how you feel . Why do n't you stay here tonight ? The change will be good for you , give us time to put our heads together . " " I  --  I ca n't . " She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , very , very gravely . Julia looked back to Florence . " My father  --  my father  --  " " Ai n't nothing going to happen to your father . " " He wo n't know where I am . " " He 'll know where you are the minute I pick up a phone and tell him . " " What you going to tell him ? " " That we got to talking and you got tired and I put you to bed . " " He going to wonder what we talked about  --  " " Men been wondering what women talk about for ages , honey , ai n't no new thing  --  anyway , all we been talking about is you and little Jimmy . " But she watched the terror and the torment in Julia 's face , a terror and torment made vivid by her attempts to hide it . " Well  --  there really ai n't nothing else to talk about  --  I ai n't complaining about him  --  " " Well , then , " said Florence . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 'll be upset . " But she looked at Crunch as she said this , and dropped her eyes . Yet , " He comes in late , too late for you to phone him , you 'll be asleep . " " It 's now or never , " Crunch said . " Mama Montana 's right , and you know it . " " And he ai n't going to be upset , " said Florence . " At least , he wo n't be no more upset than usual because , if I ca n't phone him , I 'll send Arthur up there , with a note . " " Mama Montana 's a mighty good nurse , now , " Crunch said , with a cryptic smile , a wink . " And I 'll get up here to see you , fast as I can , after work . Maybe we 'll walk throughp261the park , or something . I might even buy you a hot dog . " " But I ca n't stay here , " said Julia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence . " How come you ca n't stay here ? " " You ca n't stay up yonder , neither , " Crunch said flatly , " you told me that yourself , this afternoon . " He lifted that one eyebrow at her . " You forgot already ? " A silence abruptly weighted down the room , a silence like eternity : they heard the streets . Julia stood , abruptly , and walked to the window , her hands in her pockets . The wind briefly billowed the green rag at the back of her head , then let it fall to the nape of her neck . She turned to Crunch . " No , " she said . " I ai n't forgot . I 'll never forget . " " You can use my bed , " said Arthur . " I was going to make up the couch , " said Florence . " Where you going to stay ? " " I 'll stay with Crunch , " said Arthur . " That 's right , " said Crunch . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well  --  run up , and leave a note for Brother Miller . " " Okay . You want me to write the note ? " " No . I 'll write it . Do n't you two be staying out all night . " The note said , Dear Joel , Your daughter , Julia , is staying the night with me , so do n't worry about her . We 'll call you in the morning . Where you been keeping yourself ? Both me and Paul would be GLAD TO SEE YOU . May God bless you and keep you . Florence MontanaThe Miller bell did not answer , so Arthur left the note in the mailbox , with the tip sticking out , and ran down the brownstone steps , to Crunch . Silently , they began walking toward the avenue , toward the subway . The summer day was just beginning to fade . The streets were full , vivid ,  |p262with  people , children , sound  --  it was as though they were moving through an element which held them up , sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hands in his pockets , silent . This silence was not exactly uncomfortable , but it was new : Arthur did not know what to make of this silence , or how to break it . Finally , he said , looking up at Crunch , " You said you had something to tell me . " " I do . " " About Julia ? " " Partly . " He looked at Arthur , and smiled . This smile , too , was new . It came from a new place , a new distance , and it held a new sorrow . " When you going to tell me ? " " In a minute . Let me think . " " Oh , " said Arthur , bewildered , stung . " I 'm not trying to rush you , man . " And he looked at the cracks in the sidewalk . They walked down the subway steps in silence , pushed through the turnstiles , waited for the train . Arthur suddenly felt very young . He wanted to ask , Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go back home ? But he feared the answer . He felt , as he had sometimesfelt with his father , or with me , that he was just a snot-nosed kid , in the way , and the best thing for him to do was to keep quiet . So he kept quiet as he and Crunch stepped onto the crowded train . Crunch leaned against the door ; Arthur stood next to Crunch , still wondering if he should leave . Crunch did n't seem to see him , or to know that he was there . But he knew that if he tried to leave , Crunch would call him back . Crunch would be hurt  --  it was a game he could n't play , a risk he could n't take . He stared at himself in the subway window as the train shook and roared through the tunnel . The people were as silent as people in a dream , numbly submitting to the roar and the movement ,  |p263each  person absolutely , sullenly alone . He would be alone soon , next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  evenCrunch 's silence would be gone . Then he knew that he could not possibly leave Crunch now , not unless Crunch beat him and pushed him away . But at 42nd Street , when they changed to the shuttle to the east side , Crunch put one arm around him  --  as though to say that he knew Arthur was there and was glad that he was there . They came out of the subway at Fourteenth Street and started walking east , toward Crunch 's room . The El was still standing then , and so I see them , standing on the corner , waiting for the light , under that monstrouscanopy . In the shadow of all that metal , beneath the unspeakable hostility of the inescapable trains  --  Arthur imagines that a man might climb the stairs to the platform and throw himself under a train , simply to be released from the everlasting roar to get some sleep  --  Crunch 's door , and all the doors on this avenue , seem furtive , doomed , sordid , choked payment for choked sins . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people on this street . He wonders what happened to them , how they got that way  --  they , who must once have had a mother and father , brother and sister , uncles , aunts , cousins , friends , wives  --  even , children  --  who must once have been as young and clean as he and Crunch are now . But , now  --  they have entered eternity : eternal damnation must look like this . He wonders if he and Crunch are damned . Perhaps love is a sin . But he shakes his head against the thought , and the light changes . They cross the street . On the corner there is a bar , never silent , never empty . The men in the bar look like soldiers who have barely survived , but hours ago , slaughter ; who have seen their buddieshacked limb from limb , have seen them blinded , gutted , castrated ; look like men who are carrying bloody souvenirs in their pockets : an ear , an eye , a nose , a penis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their only proof that they have survived . This hard miracle lives in their fevered and yet lightless eyes , and they have nop264age . They are all the color of gunmetal , and their sweat causes them to shine like that , and they are all  --  as far as Arthur can tell  --  white men . Arthur is young enough to wonder how this can happen to white men ; he does not know any white men yet . He does not feel at all vindictive or triumphant ; he only feels a kind of falling wonder . In the morning , they will be lying on the sidewalk , drenched in their own piss . Next to the bar , there is a candy store , still open  --  candy , chewing gum , newspapers , cigarettes  --  and the fat owner , always wearing a gray baseball cap , and glasses , sits in the open window , a toothpick between his teeth . Next to the candy store , beneath three signs , each reading ROOMS , are three narrow doors which seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Crunch and Arthur enter the last of these . They were , then , in a narrow hall , facing a steep flight of steps . They began to climb , and a door at the top of the stairs immediately opened and a young black girl in a bathrobe stood there , waiting . Her hair was uncombed  --  " nappy "  --  and the bathrobe was half open , revealing a dirty nightgown and the beginning of her breasts , breasts surprisingly heavy for a girl so thin . And she seemed very young , not much more than a child . Arthur had never seen her before . " Oh , it 's you , Mr. Hogan , " she said . But she had never seen Arthur before , and she stared at him  --  with wonder and hostility  --  and then looked back to Crunch . " He 's with me , " Crunch said . Another figure appeared behind her , a heavy-set white man , with iron-gray curly hair , a long , heavy nose , and brutally self-indulgent lips . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him , pushing her toward the open door behind them . " It 's all right , " he said . " It 's his kid brother . Evening , Mr. Hogan , " and they went back into the room , locking the door behind them.  |p265In  silence , Crunch and Arthur climbed to Crunch 's room , which was on the third floor . In the split second that the girl and the man had looked at him , Arthur had felt violated , stripped naked , spat on . It was in nothing that was said . It was in the contempt and complicityin the eyes . He had never felt this before , though he had seen the man before . But this time , when the black girl had looked at him , he had immediately wondered what she was doing there : and it was immediately clear to him that she did not wonder what he was doing there . And what the white man really said , with a lewd grunt , was , He says it 's his kid brother . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sounds , from the sheets  --  though these were not changed very often . But if Crunch and Arthur could hear others , and they did , every night they spent here , others could also hear them . Then he wanted to run , not from Crunch exactly , but out of this eternity . When Crunch came back , they would find another room , a private place . But to think of Crunch 's return was to think of Crunch 's departure , and he put both arms around Crunch 's waist and rubbed his forehead against Crunch 's back as Crunch unlockedtheir door . The room was even uglier than the room in Washington , and smaller , with an old-fashioned , noisy brass bed . There was a table , a chair , a ceiling light , and a sink , and a dim mirror above the sink . The room was on the street , or , more accurately , faced the tracks . The violence of the trains accompaniedtheir ecstasy , and the pinched , glaring faces of the people flying by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really disliked the room until now , had never really looked at it . Some nights he and Crunch had lain awake , smoking , the light from their cigarettes the only light , and watched the trains go by , happy to be together and caring for nothing else . Now happiness was leaving , that was all he knew ; it was rolling itself up , like a scroll . Crunch locked the door behind them , and sat down onp266the bed , and , now , abruptly , it was Arthur 's turn to be silent . Crunch lit a cigarette , and looked over at Arthur , who stood by the door . " You mad at me ? " Arthur smiled , and shook his head no . Crunch watched him . " You coming in , or going out ? " " That 's up to you , man . " But Arthur moved from the door , and went to stand by the window , looking out . Now everything was quiet , except the rumble of a train approaching . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur turned from the window , and sat down on the floor , at Crunch 's knee . " What 's the matter , Crunch ? Did I do something ? " Crunch sighed and said , " No , baby . " He leaned back and yawned , and took a drag on his cigarette . The downtown train , on the far side of the tracks , came squealing into the station . " No , baby . I did something . " Arthur listened to the train doors opening , the distant murmur of shifting weight . There was a pause , as though silence had made a hole in sound . The train doors thunderedclosed . Arthur rested his head against Crunch 's knee . Metal squealed against metal , the train pulled out of the station . He heard the uptown train , on their side of the street , approaching . He knew now , dimly , that he did not really want to know ; at the same moment , he realized that he had no choice  --  he asked : " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something first , Arthur "  --  and Crunch sat up , speaking to the back of Arthur 's head  --  " what you going to do when I go away from here ? " " I do n't know , Crunch . I do n't want to think about it . " " You 've got to think about it ! " He reached down and turned Arthur 's face to his , and hisp267hands were suddenly wet with Arthur 's tears . Arthur had not made a sound and his body was not shaking . He turned his face away and leaned the back of his head against Crunch 's knee . " I do n't know , Crunch . I 'll keep on going to school , naturally , and I 'll keep on working with my music  --  and  --  I 'll wait till you come back . " And suppose I do n't come back ? Crunch wanted to say . But he said , " Arthur , what about  --  ? " The uptown train stopped at the station , seemed nearly , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Other people . " " What other people ? " " Arthur  --  have you ever had a girl ? No . I guess you have n't . " " What you talking about ? " " It would be good for you  --  to have a girl . " " Well  --  I 'm sure I will , Crunch  --  one of these days . " He wiped his face with the back of his hand and turned to look at Crunch . " Why you talking about that now ? " Crunch looked uneasy , and the uptown train rushed pasttheir window , causing the entire building to shake . " Maybe I just hope you make love to a girl while I 'm goneinstead of  --  " " A man ? Another man ? " Arthur looked down at the floor . " I have n't thought about it , Crunch . I have n't thought about it at all . I just love you . " " Well , you ca n't love me forever , man , you got to grow up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and strode to the window , looking out . Arthur watched his back . " That what you wanted to talk to me about ? " " Yes . No . No . " " Why ca n't I love you forever ? I will anyway . " " Arthur , you just a baby , and sometimes , I swear  --  ! " " You sorry ? You sorry about us ? "  | " No . No , Arthur , do n't take it that way . I just  --  I just want you to be all right . I want you to be happy . I do n't "  --  he faltered , the streets seemed strangely silent  --  " I do n't want you to be sorry . " " Sorry about us ? I 'll never be sorry about us , I swear , no matter what happens . " " I made love to Julia this afternoon . " Crunch sat down , abruptly , on the bed , as though someone had pushed him , and stared at Arthur . His face held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He asked , " And were you going to bring her here tonight ? " Then , looking up , " That why you been so quiet ? " " No . I did n't want to bring her here tonight . " " You can go get her , you know . I do n't want you to do nothing you do n't want to do , not because of me , man  --  you want me to find a girl now , because you found a girl ! " " Arthur , Julia ai n't nothing but a child  --  " " Then how come you to make love to her ? Of course , I guess you think I ai n't nothing but a child ! " " Arthur ? will you listen to me ? Please ? Please ? " Arthur stood up and walked back to the window , his hands in his pockets . Crunch could not see his face . " Arthur ? " " I 'm listening . " " Come over here . " Arthur did not move . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed him , pulling him down on the bed . Crunch moved so that he was leaning against the headrest , with Arthur in his arms , the back of Arthur 's head against Crunch 's chest . " Arthur , please try to listen , and do n't get mad at me , and do n't jump all evil and proud . I know I can bring a girl down here if I want to , and you can , too , if you want to , and I was n't saying you should get a girl because I got a girl . I do n't have a girl . " He paused , and swallowed . He said , " I just have you . "  |p269It  was impossible to tell , from Arthur 's stillness , what was going on in his mind : and Crunch was afraid to turn him so that he could see his face . " You a beautiful kid , Arthur , you do n't know it , and a whole lot of slimy motherfuckers and some of them might look just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you ca n't blame me if I get worried about it . " " What 's that got to do with Julia  --  and this afternoon ? " " Arthur  --  people get in trouble and they need help  --  and , sometimes  --  you ca n't say no . " But , Crunch thought , at least , he 's listening : and he held Arthur a little tighter . Still , he did not know what to sayexactly  --  hedid not know how to say it . He remembered Julia 's face , and body , her overwhelming need . He said , " Sometimes a person just needs somebody 's arms around them , then anything can happen  --  one thing leads to another  --  doyou understand me ? " " I think so . " " Do you know I would n't hurt you , man , for anything in the world ? " Arthur was silent . " Do you ? " " Yes . But  --  I do n't understand  --  " " Look , I ca n't tell you everything . It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . She 's got to get away from her daddy . " He paused . " That 's why I was glad your mama asked her to stay at your house . " " Crunch  --  was you fixing to bring her here  --  if  --  ? " " No . At least not tonight . I had to talk to you first . I was n't looking to get my brains beat out . " He lit a cigarette . " Arthur ? " " Yeah ? " " You listening ? " " Sure . " " I want you to do something for me  --  do me a favor . Okay ? " " Okay . " " I want you to look out for Julia . Be her friend . Forgetp270about this afternoon . That 's just something that happened . That 's life . You 'll understand it  --  better  --  by and by , " and Crunch smiled . " What do you want me to do ? " " Just be her friend . She 's got to get away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crunch 's face . " It 's that bad ? " " It 's worse than that . " " What does Julia want to do ? " " She told you tonight . She wants to take care of her little brother . " " But she ca n't  --  she 's not old enough ! " Crunch put out his cigarette . His face was bleak as he looked down , and said , " Who knows ? She 's seen enough already to make her more than old enough . " Arthur was silent . Then , very shyly , " Crunch , do you love Julia ? If you do , it 's all right . I wo n't be jealous  --  " Crunch grinned . " I bet . That why you was acting so funny a few minutes ago ? " " Oh , I was just surprised  --  " " If that 's the way you act when you surprised , I damn sure ai n't going to be giving you no surprise birthday par-ties ! " " Oh , come on , Crunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  here we are : she 's fourteen . You sixteen . I 'm almost twenty . I felt like a old man , a wicked old man . But I do n't know what else I could have done , except disappear or die . That girl was crying out , Arthur . Crying . " He shook his shoulders , remembering the sullen day . He looked down at Arthur . " She do n't mean to me what you mean to me , and I hope you got that straight in your head now , but she 's in trouble and I do n't want nothing to happen to her . Be her friend . If she knows she 's got you , and your family  --  that might make a whole lot of difference . " He watched Arthur , realizing that there was peace between them again ; and he 'd told the truth , without betray/ing Julia . He leaned back on the bed , pulling Arthur closer . " But I do n't think I want her to be my girl friend , " Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , son . One thing at a time . " One week later , Crunch was gone  --  just like that , a great hole opened , and he dropped through it , out of sight . The summer ended . Day by day , and taking its time , the summer ended . The noises in the street began to change , diminish , voices became fewer , the music sparse . Daily , blocks and blocks of children were spirited away . Grownupsretreated from the streets , into the houses . Adolescents moved from the sidewalk to the stoop to the hallway to the stairs , and rooftops were abandoned . Such trees as there were allowed their leaves to fall  --  they fell unnoticed  --  seeming to promise , not without bitterness , to endure anotheryear . At night , from a distance , the parks and playgroundsseemed inhabited by fireflies , and the night came sooner , inched in closer , fell with a greater weight . The sound of the alarm clock conquered the sound of the tambourine , the houses put on their winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming , not without bitterness , to have resolved to endure another year . But , before this time , another year ! Crunch might be dead , Crunch might be back : so , this song rang and rang in Arthur'sskull as he went about doing whatever he was doing , and he never quite knew what he was doing , though he , somehow , got it done . He walked the tumultuous , resoundingstreets , streets which were incredibly silent and empty for him  --  listening for Crunch 's footfall beside him , seeing Crunch in the distance , and hurrying to catch up with him , though he knew it was not Crunch , seeing Crunch come toward him  --  going to school , rehearsing , for a time , with some people he did n't like ( he was never , in fact , to sing in a quartet again ) , working , part-time , as a Western Union messenger , singing , in churches , on the weekends.  |p272Faith  I am maintainingI go on , uncomplaining , But , before this time , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death may overtake me , If I 'm with Thee , I 've no need to fear . He sensed that Paul and Florence were worried about him . He faced the fact that , for the first time in his life , he had something to hide  --  he had dreams of Crunch being court-martialed and tortured because he , Arthur , had " talked " : and so he mastered a candid surface , stayed in his room only to study , or write letters  --  with the door open  --  and , otherwise , remained visible at the piano , his most private place . His second most private place was the movies , but he was never able to remember a single movie he had seen as that summer ended and fall , then winter came . Make my pathway brighter , Make my burden lighter , Help me to do good whenever I can . Let Thy presence thrill me , Thy Holy Spirit fill me , And hold me in the hollowOf Thy hand . " That song sure seems to mean a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been listening to Arthurplay for several minutes . Arthur had not realized that his father was in the room . " Oh  --  hello , Daddy . " He let his fingers drop from the keyboard . " I have to sing it tomorrow night , in Brooklyn . " " You accompany yourself when you sing ? " " Sometimes . Not all the time . Most of the time I follow the church pianist . " " Can they follow you ? " Paul asked and laughed , and , after a moment , Arthur laughed . " Sometimes . " He looked at his father . " It do n't seem to me like I 'm that hard to follow  --  and most of them , really , they play better piano than me. "  | " Well , " Paul said , " you do n't really hear yourself . But that 's all right  --  for right now , anyway , that 's all right . " They were alone in the house . Florence was out  --  shopping , or having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old gang ? " Arthur had a letter from Crunch in his pocket , but it took him a moment to say  --  trying to look as though it had slipped his mind : " Oh . Yeah , I got a letter from Crunch . " " How is he ? " " He sounds fine . He sends his love . " " He 's a fine boy , " Paul said , and lit his pipe . He walked to the window . " I reckon you sure miss him , do n't you ? " " Yeah , " said Arthur glumly , speaking to himself . Then , " I mean , yes sir , I sure do . We  --  all  --  had some nice times together . " " How 's his family ? " " I believe they 're all right , sir . " " Yeah , " said Paul . " You latched onto him like he was Hall  --  like he was your big brother . " Arthur felt immediately disloyal . " Why no , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and Arthur blushed . " Hall 's my brother , " Arthur said lamely . " Crunch  --  Crunch  --  he 's my friend . " " Just the same , he 's older than you , and you always been the younger brother and so you needed another older brother . Somebody you could trust , " and Paul looked at Arthuragain . " Ai n't nothing wrong with it  --  the youngest always needs the oldest . Until , " he added , after a devastatingpause during which he lit his pipe again , " the youngest grows up enough to realize he 's his own man and ca n't keep running to his older brother no more . " He paused again , and looked at Arthur . " Especially if he 's not really the older brother but just the older friend . " " But ca n't a friend , " Arthur dared , " be as important as a brother ? " " He can be more important . I 'm just saying they 're not the same . " He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get married , for example "  --  here he paused for another examination of his pipe  --  " if you do , and I hope you do , that woman you marry , she going to have be more important than your mama or your daddy . You ai n't going to be living with us . You going to be living with her , and raising your children with her . We ca n't hold on to you  --  we leaving . We did what we could . And you ca n't hold on to us  --  ca n't nobody move backward , not far , anyhow . They come to grief . " He smiled , but something in the smile frightened Arthur . " And I do n't want you to come to grief . " Arthur sensed a warning : he did not want to hear it . To hear it would be to confess . Something in him longed to break his silence , to ask What 's happening to me ? He longed to lay his burden down , and end his tormented wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " heart " : he sat silent , looking down at the keyboard . " What you thinking about , son ? " " I was thinking about what you said . But , " he looked up and smiled , " I do n't know what to say about it . " " Well , keep on thinking about it , then . Ai n't no harm . " Hide me in Thy bosomTill the storm of life is o'er . Rock me in the cradle of Thy love ! Feed me , Jesus , Till I want no more , And take me to Thy blessedHome above ! He was singing for Crunch  --  to keep Crunch safe , and to bring Crunch back , and he was singing for me , to keep me safe and to bring me back : he was singing to hold up the world . There entered his voice then , therefore , a mightily moving , lonely sweetness and the people were transfigured and transfixed : he sang to their love and their worry ; he sang to their hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made his confession at the throne of mercy and knew himself , then , as his voice issued from him , to be redeemed , in the hands of a power greater than any on thep275earth . His love was his confession , his testimony was his song . So he gritted through the grinding days and nights , the ferocity of his dreams , his leaping body 's ache , the sorrow , like a carpet , at the bottom of his soul . He had no friends anymore , and was unable to imagine himself with friends . Everyone he saw , he saw from very far away , as at the wrong end of a telescope . Their words  --  sounds  --  simply spun in the air , utterly meaningless ; their words never reached him . He liked his job as messenger because it left him alone for hours in the streets , and demanded nothing more of him than physical energy . When his job ended , he went to the movies and sat in the dark , letting images and sounds roll over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time with Crunch  --  every song , every gesture , every embrace  --  until he felt that he was going crazy , began , really , to be afraid that , in another moment , he would begin to howl and be carried off to Bellevue . Sometimes he almost wished that this would happen . But , no  --  neither Crunch nor I wished to find him in Bellevue . We were suffering , too , after all , and we had a right to expect him to keep the faith . And at such moments , too , he felt that if he were to fail his lover , or his brother , he would then , somehow , have cut the cord binding us to life : if he faltered for an instant , someone , somewhere , on the other side of the world , in that very same instant , would know that love had failed and thus , be enabled to bring us down . At such moments , he shuddered  --  it is not easy to bear so cosmic a weight  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rose ' and walked out into the streets or went home , to the piano . But sometimes , he simply sat in the movies and let the tears roll down his face , and saw nothing . And it was hard for him at home , though he did not like to admit this . He wanted , really , to leave home , although he knew that , for the moment , this was neither possible nor just . It was as though , at home , he found himself trapped in a play , acting a role he had played too long.  |p276Paul  and Florence were worried about him , of course they were . They could not help this , and they could not hide it , and the devices they used to dissemble their concern set his teeth on edge . Their worry was not nearly as specific as Arthurimagined  --  they were not alarmists . They were not concerned about his attachment to Crunch , which they took as inevitable . Only time could indicate to what extent it was " normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility in a crisis . He had , as far as they could see , no other friends  --  Peanut was gone , Red was soon to go  --  but there was nothing they could usefully say , or do , about that ; especially since a certain standoffishness was a family trait . Arthur was no worse than I had been at his age , and no worse , certainly , than his father . Yet , they were concerned about the nature , the meaning , of his privacy . They did not want to violate it : at the same time , they wanted him to know that they  --  and life , and love , and the world  --  were his . They could not break in ; he could not break out . They wished that I were home  --  naturally , for many reasons  --  though they also wondered what I would be like when I got there . They also realized , though Arthur did n't , that , as he was outgrowing everything and everybody , he would also have outgrown his relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding each other again . This made mealtime an exercise in grace and tension , sustained by a certain cheerfulness which came , in fact , out of love . But the restless and lonely Arthur needed somethinghis parents could not give him , which no one , in fact , could give him now , not even Crunch  --  though Arthur did not know this , either . Arthur hid a secret and he hated having anything to hide ; he had never had a secret before . He poured it all into his song , and Paul watched him , and listened , striving to become reconciled . Julia was the only person Arthur saw . This was partly because of his promise to Crunch . She was the closest thing to Crunch and she was , also , the only person in the world , now , who spoke his language . They knew the same things.  |p277And  his jealousy had evaporated . There had , literally , not been time for it . He had given her the key to Crunch 's room , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he entered the room , he had a secret ; but this was a secret he could clasp to himself with both pain and joy . Julia did not know , no one in the world knew ; only he and Crunch knew what wonders had taken place in this room , this broken-down , filthy , miraculous room ! He paced the room sometimes , as Julia talked , remembering : leaned out of the window , looked into the mirror , touched the bed , remembering , remembering , proud , and almost happy . Crunch 's odor was still in the bed , in the chair  --  in the air , and everything Arthur touched Crunch had touched , his fingerprints were still there , Crunch was present in this room ! He was almost frightened sometimes , to feel this presence with such power , but he was unbelievably happy , too , and grateful to Julia . Without her need , and Crunch 's promise to her , he would never have been able to enter this room again . Perhaps he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared his secret without knowing that she did . On a Saturday evening , near the end of summer , he climbed the familiar stairs and knocked on the unusual door . " Arthur ? " " Yeah . " " Come on in . The door 's open . " Julia was wearing a shapeless smock and her hair was tied up and the trash can was full . She had been cleaning the room . " You should n't leave your door unlocked , when you down here by yourself . " " Are you kidding ? These locks ca n't keep nobody out  --  these doors ca n't keep nobody out . And I do n't know why I 'm trying to clean this room . It ca n't be done , I must be crazy . " She ran water in the sink and soaped her hands and grinned at him . " How you keeping ? "  | " All right . And you ? " " Okay . All things considered . How was your day ? " " Shitty . " She laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mov-ies ? " " If you want . " " What you want to see ? " " I do n't know . I brought a paper , thought I 'd leave it up to you . " He does n't say it , but the truth is that he 's already seen everything that 's playing . " I see . You want me to do all the work . " She dried her hands on paper towels which she must have brought with her , and dropped the towels into the trash basket . He sat down on the bed , caressing it , and looked around the room . Julia had brought a plant from uptown and put it in the window , she had washed the windows , and covered the chair with a bright red rag . There were two water glasses on the sink , and she had covered the hideous , rickety night table with another brightly colored rag . That was about the limit of what could be done with the room  --  the room 's only real hope was fire  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These people giving you any trouble ? " " Oh , that black girl , I believe she 's a mental case "  --  Arthur laughed  --  " do n't laugh . I do !  --  she tried to give me some lip , and I told her again , just like you told her and just like Crunch told her , that this was our brother 's room and I was going to be responsible for it and keep it clean and all until my brother  --  our brother  --  got back here . She wanted to know if I was going to use the room . I said , Sure I was going to use the room long as I was paying the rent . " She paused , and looked at the trash can . " Now , what am I going to do with this ? She ai n't never going to empty it . " " I 'll empty it , " Arthur said . " Leave it alone . " " Why do n't you go on and empty it now , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we can go . " " Okay , " Arthur said , and picked up the trash can , andp279walked out of the door . He had to hunt for a garbage can not already overflowing , but he finally managed to empty the trash can . The streets were full , people stumbling or amblingby  --  no one paid any attention to him at all . He started back up the stairs , whistling . Julia was combing her hair , was wearing her green slacks , and an old gray sweater . " Thanks , Arthur . " Arthur put the trash can down . " Let 's get a hot dog around the corner , okay ? I 'm hungry . " She locked the door behind them , and put the key in her pocket . As they started down the steps , they heard someonecoming up . " Oh , Lord , I bet you that 's Blanche , " said Julia . It was the black girl , and they met her on the second story landing . She was , relatively speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a blouse swollen by her great breasts . Her dark , narrow eyes considered them with the aimless and unanswerable hostility with which she seemed to regard everything and everybody . " Good evening , Blanche , " said Julia . " You coming back tonight ? " " I might be . I do n't know . " Blanche looked at Arthur . This was a different look  --  unanswerable , but not aimless : contemptuous , triumphant . She knew that Arthur hated her , hated her from his heart ; hated her , and feared her because she knew what Crunch and he were to each other . She had divined that Julia did not know , and that he did not want her to know . She knew that he was not Crunch 's brother , and Julia was not his sister . " You coming back ? " " What difference does it make ? the rent 's paid . " Blanche looked at them from her intimidating distance . " Yes , " she said . " The rent 's paid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Somebody might be coming by , one time , to find out just how the rent gets paid . You mighty young , it seems to me , to be doing what you doing . "  | " I do n't know what you think I 'm doing , " Julia said , " but you look mighty young to me , too . " Blanche kept moving up the steps , they continued down . They got into the streets . " I might be doing anything , " Julia said . " They worried about the law . Shoot . The law do n't care . They ought to know that . Everything 's going on down here . " Yeah , Arthur thought , but we do n't know the rules , baby , but he said nothing . He was worried about too many things . He was worried about what Blanche might tell Julia , for he knew that Crunch , in spite of his intention , had finallysaid nothing . Crunch might have had the courage , but certainly had not had the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the courage , at least not yet . And he was worried about Julia being alone down here at night , and Crunch had been worried , too ; the room was in his name , after all , and Julia was a minor . But , he had sighed , we do n't have too much choice , man . She 's got to get away from her daddy . Arthur 's impression was that Joel Miller was drinkingheavily and became uncontrollably dangerous when drunk and that Julia used the room as a haven at those times . This explanation had vaguely dissatisfied him , but it was only now that he was beginning to bring his full attention to bear on it . " Do you stay here at night , a lot of the time ? " " No . " Just before his departure , she had spent one night down here with Crunch , and one afternoon . Arthur did not know this . She was terrified , down here , by herself ; but she had been terrified of her father , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this room until she was sure that her father had fallen into a drunken sleep . But she had never managed to sleep alone in this room , it was impossible , though she had tried to steel herself to do it , the way an athlete trains himself to meet a mighty challenge . She had sat all night , with the lights out , huddledat the head , or the foot of the bed , listening to the trains roar by , watching the lights flashing in and out of the room , listening to the streets , to the footsteps on the stairs ,  |p281the  rocking , crashing beds , the muttered , muffled sighs , and curses , the pleas , the commands , the sound of running water . Every time she heard feet climb the stairs , she bowed her head between her knees , and prayed : do n't let them unlock this door ! Then she longed to run back to her father  --  at least his touch was familiar , and , when it was over , she would sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not slept since her mother died and would not sleep again until she found her brother . One night , she had had to go to the bathroom , and she crept out , locking her door behind her . The bathroom was unbelievably filthy , but she was obliged to add her filth to the rest  --  and leave it there , because the toilet did not flush . When dawn came , she took the subway home . Joel was asleep , fully dressed , on the sofa . She had wanted to move . She had moved , all right  --  into an unknown section of hell . She remembered someone saying to her once , Now , hell , child , you just remember  --  hell do n't have no boundaries . Then , But you got to go there to find out . Now she and Arthur crossed a street and walked half a block to the hot-dog stand and bought two hot dogs . " What movie we going to see ? " " I do n't care . " " Well  --  you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here ? " " I think I 'll go uptown . Do n't like the way Blanche looked at me . " " Well  --  we can see a movie uptown then , " said Arthur , and they started toward the subway . Yet , just the same , she had moved : she had got through those nights . Something had happened ; her father knew it , and it frightened him . His fear was no more dependable than anything else about him , she could n't count on it ; but she had seen that he was frightened when she came in on the morning after she had spent the night at our house . He was just about to leave  --  she had timed it that way  --   |p282and  was writing her a note . He looked , with elaborate disapproval , at her halter and slacks . " So , you got kidnapped ? " With his little smile . " Why you saying that ? I did n't think you 'd mind . They 're your old friends . " " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you all have a good time ? Who all was there ? " When he said " your mother 's friends , " she tensed , as though he had hit her in the belly , or caught her in a lie . Florence had been talking to her about her mother . She had felt that Florence knew much more than she would say : she had longed to break down and tell Florence the truth and beg for her help . But she felt that it was only she , Julia , who had , somehow , brought herself to this place and only she could get herself past it . " Just us . We ate , and talked . Mr. Montana came in later . " She hesitated . " Crunch and Arthur were there "  --  she watched his face , but she could see that he did not feel threatened by these boys --  " but they had to go somewhere , so it was mostly me and Mama Montana . We had a good visit , she 's a nice woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why you never come to see them . " " I did n't hardly ever visit them , daughter . It was your mother . " She realized that he was frightened of any of her " mother 's friends " whom she might see outside , who might , as he would have put it , turn her against him . " That do n't stop them from wondering , Daddy . " She could see him calculating , calculating danger . " Well  --  we might go visit one evening . I 'll do anything to please you , daughter . " He said this with the jaunty , mocking , gallant grin which she had always found so moving , and which moved her now , suddenly , in a very unpleasant way . " You better get on to work , " she said . " Do n't , you be late . " " Give us a kiss . " This was morning ritual.  |p283She  realized that he was standing in the place where she and Crunch had lain the day before . She suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to him . She wondered what he wanted . He came to her , his lips parted , and he covered her breasts with his hands . He whispered , " I missed you last night . " She took his hands away , kissed him , lightly , on the forehead . " Go on , " she said . " You going to be late . " " Well  --  you going ' to have to make up for that when I come home . " He was being jaunty still , but he was at a loss ; he could not find her position . He started for the door . " You all did n't talk about me too much last night , did you ? " " Like I said , Daddy , they just wonder why you never come to see them . " " And what did you tell them ? " " I said you 'd been very upset . " " Yeah , you sure got me upset , all right . Do n't know what I 'm doing half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You going to be here now , when I get back ? " He stood in the doorway , with the daylight behind him , around his skull , his curly black hair . His face was in shadow , but she watched the sparkling eyes , the teeth , the anxious , boyish grin . Soon , just the same , she would be free . " Go on , " she said . " I reckon I 'll be here . " He hesitated for yet another moment , then closed the door behind him . And if I 'm not here , she thought , I 'll leave you a note . After the movie , they sat down in a coffee shop around 135th and Seventh Avenue , and drank coffee and listened to the jukebox . They had seen William Holden and Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard . " Why did she shoot him ? " Julia asked . " If he wanted to go , why did n't she just let him go ? That do n't make no sense to me at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess she was crazy about the cat  --  I guess the cat drove her crazy . " " She was crazy , all right . I do n't believe in that kind of love . People got a right to their own life . " " It must be wonderful , though , " said Arthur , " for someone to love you that much . " " Now you sound crazy . To have somebody love you so much you ca n't even go to the bathroom without them havinga fit ? " She sipped her coffee and looked over at the jukebox , where some boys and girls were standing . Some boys and girls were dancing in the streets . She looked back at Arthur , and grinned . " You think it would be wonderful . It would be wonderful , all right  --  you 'd be wonderful  --  inside of a week , you 'd be so wonderful you 'd be carried away , screaming . " She laughed . " Black people ai n't made for that kind of nonsense . " " Black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girl . Every Saturday night , some chick goes crazy and takes out her razor and starts chopping up her man . " He grinned . " You been in the pulpit , you ai n't been out here . But  --  you just stay out here awhile . " She said , after a moment , " It 's strange out here , I 'll give you that . " " It 's dangerous out here , baby . " " Oh , come on . How come you trying to be so grown-up with me ? How long you been out here ? " " Never mind , sister . Longer than you . " " Well . I sure do n't want nobody loving me so much they going to be coming after me with guns and razors . " Arthur grinned . " I do n't know , girl . You done lost your salvation and you out of the pulpit and you look mighty fine walking these streets . I 'd be careful , if I was you . " " You hush . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she said this , she thought of Crunch , her face changed , and Arthurlaughed . " It ai n't that far in the future . I believe you almost ready . " " I got a lot to do before all that . " She stirred her coffee ,  |p285looking  both young and old . She looked at the clock on the wall behind the counter . " I got to make some money and get away from here . " She looked again , wistfully , at the boys and girls before the jukebox . " I was never young like that , " she said . " You mean  --  because of the pulpit ? " She shrugged . " I guess . Partly . But  --  I was just never  --  young . " " Well  --  do n't you feel younger now ? " She looked at him , and Arthur said quickly , " Well , no , I guess you do n't . " The reality of her trouble returned to him ; he realized that he did not want to understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not want him to understand it , either . Her swift , girlish , or even boyish manner , and everything she said , were stratagems designed to protect a distance . Yet she had confided in Crunch . And she was not a virgin anymore ; Crunch had held her in his arms . They never talked about it , he rarely thought about it  --  his imagination simply refused to accept it  --  and yet , the unspoken love , and the weight of the unknown trouble bound them together and caused them to be friends . " I guess I better be getting home , " she said , and something in the way she said it brought him sharply to attention . It was ten thirty . " Will your father be home ? " " I hope not . He might be . " Now she looked old ; she looked out at the children dancingin the street . " You can stay at my house , " he said . " Thanks , Arthur , " and she smiled . " But I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want to , you know that , why not ? " " My daddy would shoot me , " she said , and she laughed . " Does he drink a lot  --  your father ? " " Yes , " she said . " Since my mother died . He always drank  --  a little  --  but now he drinks a lot . " " That 's why you do n't want to go home ? "  | " Well  --  it 's hard  --  to know what to do when somebody drinking a lot  --  and you ca n't talk to him . But I ca n't just keep staying out . I 've got to get out . " " You do n't want to go downtown ? I 'll ride down with you . " " I 'm starting to be afraid of Blanche . That girl is evil . She likely to set everything on fire , she know I 'm down there . " He sighed . " I still do n't know why you ca n't come to our house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want to do  --  you want to get to New Orleans  --  well , Mama could help you find a way to do that . " " Arthur . I ca n't go to New Orleans like this . My grandmamado n't need another mouth to feed . I do n't want Jimmy to see me like this . " " Why not ? What 's wrong with you the way you are ? " She looked down . She said stubbornly , " I got to find a way . " He said nothing  --  there was nothing he could find to say to her stubborn privacy . Something in her had moved far beyond him . But she had always been beyond him , even as a tiny preacher with those eyes as old as Egypt and that voice which had nothing to do with the time she had spent on earth . It was strange to feel , suddenly , sitting in front of her , that in spite of everything  --  her manner , her voice , her trouble  --  Julia had not changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant one , and , while his mind could not turn away from this mystery , neither could his mind grasp it . But he had heard in her voice , when she said , I got to find a way , the same inexorable acceptance of the unnameable that he had heard in her voice from the pulpit . " Hell , " he said , mysteriously irritated . " You ai n't got to find a way tonight . " " How do you know ? There is a night coming which wo n't have no tomorrow . " " Oh , Lord , " he said , disguising his tension with a laugh . " You talk like you still in the pulpit . " She said nothing for a long while , and he listened to thep287sounds from the jukebox . He watched the boys and girls , about their age , older , laughing , talking , seeming to quarrel , moving with and against each other as though they were all bound together by invisible strings , strings which they were both testing and longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , older than he , older than Julia  --  they seemed to have made their discoveries already . It was this , though , paradoxically , which made them innocent and vulnerable : that they seemed to imagine that there was nothing to discover . They clung to each other , and the jukebox , as though time could never take these away ; or as though they had already seen what time could take away and moved and talked and danced now with a kind of belligerent , doomed defiance . He looked at Julia , who was watching this scene from far away , or who was , perhaps , not watching this scene at all . Her eyes , now , told him nothing . " We might as well go , " she said . She rose , and he rose with her . He paid the man at the counter , and they walked past the jukebox and the kids at the jukebox , into the streets . " Which way do you want to go ? " he asked . " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come stay at your house tomorrow . " " I 'll walk you , " he said . They walked in silence for a while . Then Julia said , " Sometimes , now that I 'm out of the pulpit , I feel more in the pulpit than I did when I was preaching . " " How come ? " he asked . The streets were dark and very quiet , people standing in pools of light on street corners and on the stoops . " I do n't know , " she said . " Maybe I see the people better than I did . Maybe I see myself . When I was preaching , I do n't think I knew what I was saying . I did n't know what it meant . " They walked in silence for a while . He did not know what to say . " But now it comes back to me . I hear myself again  --  butp288really , for the first time . " She was walking with her hands in her pockets . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How could you preach it  --  if you did n't know it was true ? " " Oh , I believed it  --  but I did n't know . And now , maybe , I do n't believe it but I 'm beginning to know . " She looked at him and smiled . " I know that sounds crazy . " " Maybe , " he said , after a moment . " Maybe not . " " When I preached about how the Lord , He can cause your soul to tremble , " she said , " I did n't know that it was true . " " Julia . How did you  --  ? " He did not know how to phrase his question . He had been about to ask , What made you change ?  --  but he no longer believed , as he had only a short time ago , that she had changed . This wonder tongue-tied him . It frightened him . And he could not ask What happened to you ? He was not sure that he could bear the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question hung between them in the soft , dark silence . " Maybe it was the funeral you sang at for me , " she said . " What we had to go through to get that poor woman in the ground  --  or into the kingdom , I do n't know . It came to me that she was true , even if the rest of us were liars . I do n't know . " She was silent for a long time . They crossed a street , approaching her house . She took one hand out of her pocket , holding her keys . " And then , " she said , " my mother "  --  and she stopped . He said nothing . Her house came closer . " Mama Montayourmama  --  says that my mother was a real sweet , pretty , laughing young thing  --  I never knew her like that . She was just  --  my mother . " They paused at the bottom of her steps . " I 've kept you out so long , " she said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your long walk home ? Do n't want you dropping by the wayside . "  |p289He  did not really want to go in , and he was aware that she , too , was double-minded concerning his possible effect on her father . But he remembered his promise to Crunch ; perhaps his presence could help , if only for a moment . " Just for a minute , " he said . " I 'd like to use the bathroom , please . " " No trouble at all . " They climbed the steps , she opened the street door , they walked the dark hall to the Miller apartment . She unlocked the apartment door , very quietly , switched on the light , and they stepped inside . Her father 's voice came from the living room . " Hey , Julia ? Where 've you been ? " Arthur felt Julia suck her breath in sharply and , before she could answer and before they could reach the living room , Joel appeared . He was wearing pajamas , carelessly , appallingly open , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home early , especially for you ! I do n't never see you no more , where 've you been ? " " Daddy , " Julia said , " just to the movies . With Arthur . Arthur brought me home . " He had seen only Julia . He had not seen Arthur . Julia 's words checked him . He stopped , and looked at Arthur . Arthur had wanted to get to the bathroom , and pee : Joel 's look froze his pee insidehim , froze everything inside him . He could not have peed , he could not have moved , not if life itself had depended on it . Joel 's face was wet , his pretty hair was standingall over his head . When he looked at Arthur , his hair seemed to stand up , a muscle in his jaw throbbed , his mouth fell open , and there seemed to rush into his eyes all the wonder and pain and hatred of a lifetime : Joel 's wet lips hanging , his teeth gleaming , the wonder and pain and hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to shake at the same time that it held him up . His hands shook with anguish to tear out Arthur 's throat.  | " Who are you ? What you doing here with my daughter ? " He turned to Julia . " You dragging them in off the streets now ? " " Daddy , " said Julia , " this is Arthur . You know him , you know him from when he was little . " " The hell you say ! He damn sure ai n't little now . What you doing , coming in here this time of night , with my daughter ? I do n't want her fooling around with black scum like you ! She got her daddy to look out for her ! " Arthur said , " You know me , Brother Miller . You know my whole family  --  my father and my mother and my brother , Hall . I 'm Paul Montana 's son . " These credentials , as Joel stood leaning in the passageway , seemed slowly to penetrate his brain . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's right . I 'm his youngest son . Julia and me , we just went to the movies , and I walked her home . That 's all . " Joel 's lips slowly came together . His eyes changed , cleared , focused  --  and he saw Arthur . When he saw Arthur , he saw something else  --  his nakedness . He straightened , tried to close his pajamas . He said to Julia , " You should have said something , daughter . " " You did n't give me time , Daddy . " She was looking at him with pity , and from very far away . Joel looked at Arthur again , and what Arthur now saw in the eyes was harder to bear than the hatred of a short time before . A short time before  --  seconds before  --  the eyes had been alive with hatred , as brilliant and black as coal ; now they were lifeless and dead with terror . Seconds before , his voice had shaken the walls and menaced the neighborhood sleep ; now his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your father ? " he managed . " Ai n't seen him in a long while  --  guess that 's why I did n't recognize you . " He tried to smile . " You have to forgive me , son . These have been some trying days since my wife passed . I ai n't over it yet . " He looked at Julia , and , strangely , life flickered again in the eyes , and , incredibly , for that second , Arthur wasp291very moved by the man . He looked again at Arthur . " I been almost crazy worrying about my daughter , now that she ai n't got no mother . " He tried to smile , tried to put it all behind them . " Ca n't blame a man for trying to protect his only daughter . She 's all I got . " He turned to Julia . " Take Arthurin the living room , daughter , give him something to drink . I was just getting ready to go to bed . " He smiled at Arthur . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . " Astoundingly , abruptly sober , he extended his hand to Arthur . " Forgive me , son . I was just trying to protect my daughter . No hard feelings ? " Arthur shook his hand . " No , sir . No hard feelings . " Joel started up the staircase . " Good night , daughter . See you in the morning . " " Good night , Daddy . Sleep well . " see you soon . " " Good night , Brother Miller . " Joel disappeared up the stairs . They remained where he had left them , like two frightened children  --  Arthur fighting back a terrifying impulse to crack up with laughter . " Can I go pee now ? " he asked Julia . They looked at each other a moment and then Julia laughed . They laughed together , low , bewildered , frightenedlaughter , like children not wishing to be heard laughing . They heard Joel upstairs . Julia said , " You better , before you cause a real scandal , " and they laughed again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hurry up , " said Julia . " Go on . I 'll see what we got to drink . " By the time he came back , Julia had poured him a beer , and he no longer felt like laughing . " Girl , " he said , sitting beside her on the sofa , and pickingup his beer , " what you going to do ? " She said , not looking at him , " Ca n't say . I mean , I really ca n't say . " Then , still not looking at him , her arms folded , " Do n't talk to nobody about my daddy , what you saw and heard tonight  --  I know you wo n't  --  I 'm going to find a way to do what I have to do . " Then she looked at him with ap292look so candid that he wondered what she knew . " You going to have to do the same thing , one way or another  --  you know ? We all do . Sometimes I think , maybe my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I can tell you "  --  and she turned away from him , leaning forward , her hands on her knees , he saw again the great difference  --  the distance  --  between her eyes and her father 's eyes  --  " Julia ai n't dead . Julia far from dead . "  |p295I  CAME home in the fall of the year that Arthur turned eighteen . I think I came home on a Sunday . Arthur met me at the pier . I remember this long , long shed , thousands of people shouting and crying and laughing around me  --  and the ugly , pinched white faces of the officials at the pier , who did n't seem at all happy to see so many uniformed black cats home  --  and then , a kind of space cleared and , from very far away , I saw Arthur kind of loping in my direction . I could tell that he had n't seen me yet , had n't picked me out of the khaki-colored tumult . He was taller , and so it seemed to me he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in shadow . I could n't make out the expression on his face , but I could feel his apprehension and anticipation . I watched him , maneuvering myself into his path . Something I did , some telltale gesture of mine , nc doubt , snagged the corner of his eye , made him turn his head and look directly at me . His whole face opened , he suddenly looked about two years old , and he started runningtoward me . I dropped my bags , and grabbed him , lifted him off his feet and held him above my head . " Hey , young lion ! How you been ? " I set him down , and we hugged each other . I pulled away , held him by the shoulders to look into his face . He looked like he could n't stop grinning  --  I guess I looked the same way . " I tall . Goddamn , it 's good to see you . "  | " It 's good to see you , too , baby . You all right ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , you just do n't remember how I look . You really look skinny  --  you lost some weight , man . " " A little . I 'll get it back . " " You damn sure will , soon as Mama sees you . " " How is Mama ? And Daddy ? " " They fine . Mama 's been cooking for the last twenty-four hours and ai n't satisfied with nothing yet . " We laughed and we picked up my bags and started for the street . " How was it over there ? " " Just a small police action , son . Had to put them gooks in their places . They worse than the niggers , thinking they got a right to a whole country . Why , even the worst niggershere do n't want but a little piece of the country . But we showed them . We put them in their places  --  six feet under . " He had been watching my face . " It was bad ? " " Oh , yeah , baby , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if I 'll ever get clean . " We came into the sunlight , into the street . I had not seen these streets in so long , and I had seen so many other things , that they hit me like a hammer . People adjust to the scale of things around them  --  cottages , streams , bridges , wells , narrow winding roads  --  and now I was in a howling wilderness , where everything was out of scale . For a second I wondered how I could ever have lived here , how anyone could live here . I had not heard this noise in so long  --  incessant , meaningless , reducing everyone to a reflex , just as the towering walls of the buildings forced everyone to look down , into the dogshit at their feet . No one ever looked up , that was certain , except to watch some maddened creature leap from the walls , or to calculate their own leap  --  yet peoplelived here , and so had I , and I would : what a wonder . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but home . I watched the press of cars and cops around the place . Ip297asked Arthur , " How the fuck we ever going to get out of here ? " " I got a car , man , do n't worry . You just stand right there . " He looked from right to left , looking for someone , started across the street , turned back , to stand in front of me . " You do n't know how glad I am to see you , Hall . I missed you . You do n't know . " Then he started across the street again . " Stay there . I 'll be right back . " And he disappeared . Staying there was not exactly the easiest thing in the world to do . People kept pushing past me as though I were not there , and the cops kept shouting , " Keep moving , please , keep moving ! " I moved back a little from the curb , but I really could n't move very far without being swept back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed past me with their loved ones , home safe from the wars ; women were there with small children , even with babies in their arms . Yes , papas and mamas and sons were there , and sisters and uncles and aunts and cousins , all of them celebrating their miracle which is homecoming . Out of the jaws of death  --  and , for the moment , it did not matter that they had passed through one danger only to enter another . Keep moving . Keep moving  --  I looked at the cop , he looked at me : something in my look made him look around him , and look away . Cars and cabs piled  --  parked  --  three deep , picked up the heroes and their loved ones , and crawled agonizingly into the furious city . Arthur suddenly reappeared , and picked up two of my bags . " Come on . " I picked up my duffel bag and followed him into the chaos of automobiles and people . Arthur opened the trunk of a fairly old blue Pontiac , put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in , and closed the trunk . He opened the doors . " You ride in front , so you can see the city  --  I 'm sure you want to see our fair city . Look who I got to be your chauf-feur . " He got in back , I got in front . I slammed my door shut ,  |p298and  , for a minute , I did n't recognize my driver  --  who stared at me with a big grin on his face . " Goddamn , " I said finally , " Peanut ! " " That 's right , man . I changed that much ? " We laughed , and hugged each other as best we could , with the steering wheel between us . I said , " Yes  --  no , I ca n't tell , man  --  yeah , you 've changed a little . You put on some weight . " " A little . You did n't , though . Look like you lost weight . " " Yeah , I guess I did . I 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Peanut , " let us get out of this shit and get on home where you can start putting on some weight "  --  he grinned at me  --  " and get out of that funky uniform and Arthur can pour us a little taste and we can get to the grits . " " How you been , Peanut ? What you been doing ? I 'm sure glad to see you . " " I been busting my nuts in Washington , dee cee , the capitalof our great land , with some hincty , jive-ass , half-white niggers , trying not to blow my stack , and coming up here for weekends every time I could . I just ran into Arthur by accident , man , yesterday , and "  --  he grinned  --  " he pressed me into service . " We were turning east , away from the water and the boats and the warfare just behind me , but we were in a bottleneck still . " Patience , " said Peanut , watching the traffic and beginning to inch slowly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep farting , motherfucker . You might see some shit . " " You do n't like Washington ? " " Well , I 'm lucky , let 's face it , that the army decided I was half blind and so they did n't send me where they sent you . Hallelujah , bless the Lord , " and he laughed and moved across the avenue . We started inching along the side street . " But , no , I do n't like Washington . I like some of the folks I met there , but  --  it 's a real ugly , racist little town , man . You know that , " he said to Arthur . " You and Crunch found that out . " " Yeah , " said Arthur . " We found that out , all right . "  | " I remember , " I said . " Arthur wrote me that you all was down there . " " Crunch had some people to see , so he and Arthur stayed on a couple of days . Us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stopped , hoping to be able to make the next light . " But it 's just been desegregated . Say a nigger can go anywhere now , anywhere you please . Ai n't that something ? Ai n't you glad ? Now you can eat in the same room with them funky white cunts and their ball-less men . I ca n't hardly wait , myself  --  but , at the same time , I do n't believe I 'll try it alone . I 'll come up here and get some rough , Harlemcats to test the waters with me . " He laughed again , and we made the light . " You have changed , " I said . " Of course . So have you . You was over yonder , I was in Washington . What you see , what you go through , what you see others go through  --  it changes you , all right . Hey , Arthur , will you light me a cigarette , please ? " Now I know this sounds insane , but that  --  Peanut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock : a small shock , but a real one . It made me realize how long I 'd been gone , how much had happened since I 'd been gone . I turned to watch Arthur light the cigarette and hand it to Peanut . " Would you light one for me , too , please ? " Arthur gave me a quick , bright look , a wink  --  and lit the cigarette and handed it to me . " You do n't smoke ? " " Sometimes . " He lit a cigarette , put the pack back in his pocket . " I do n't smoke much . It 's not too good for the voice . " We finally got out of the press of traffic , and started up toward our house . It was a day full of sunshine , a lot of traffic , a lot of people , all moving with what seemed like purpose . Everyone seemed , to my wondering , slowly refocusing eye , exceedinglywell dressed . No one looked up , it is true , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comep300raining down on them from the sky . I had been sent away to help guarantee and perpetuate this indifference . No one , here , knew what was happening anywhere else . Perhaps no one ever knows that , anywhere : wherever here may be , it must always happen here before it can be perceived to have happened . And then , it is not really perceived , it is simply endured . Out of this endurance come , for the most part , alas , monuments , legends , and lies . People cling to these in order to deny that what happened is always happening ; that what happened is not an event skewered and immobilizedby time , but a continuing and timeless mirror of ourselves . What happened here , for example , was not stopped at Shiloh , still less at Harper 's Ferry : it is happening in our children 's lives today . I name the domestic monuments , not because I am being chauvinistic but in my role of Sambo , the tar baby . It must have been a Sunday  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black women pushing baby carriages , young people draped around the base of one of the statues at the entrance to the park , and the park seemed to be full , although the air was brisk  --  and the mourners on the benches : rigid , silent women , white , sometimes with a book ; men as still as cats ; and boys as lithe : we inched across the Circle and picked up speed . The houses began to change . " This place is really becoming Spanish , " I said . " Naturally , " said Peanut . " This place was a Spanish queen 's idea . " " Watch your language , " Arthur said , and we laughed , and I was , suddenly , in spite of everything , apart from everything , happy to be back home . We reached our block , and began rolling toward the house . Arthur leaned forward and put both arms around my neck . I put one hand on his forearm , and held it tight . The streets were full of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing faces I remembered , later tonight , tomorrow . I wondered what I was about to find out . Peanut stopped the car in front of our house . " Arthur , "  |p301he  said , " you take Hall and the bags on up , and I 'll park this car someplace and I 'll be right with you . " " Okay . " We got out , and got the bags . We slammed the trunk shut , and Peanut drove off . Some of the kids on the street looked at me curiously , or rather , looked at the uniformcuriously . A black lady whom I did n't know walked by , and said very quietly , " Welcome home . " We started climbing the stairs . Paul and Florence stood in the open doorway , and then I was their little boy again , young , younger even than Arthur , that day , because I had been spared . I did n't want to eat , or do anything , until I had taken off my uniform and had a bath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of men . Arthur came in , at the end , to scrub my back and to rinse my hair . " What you going to do later ? " he asked me . " I do n't know . I might not do anything . I 'd buy you a drink if you was old enough , but you ai n't . " " Depends , " said Arthur , carefully pouring water over my head . " Depends on what ? " " Depends on where you want to buy me a drink . " " So you been breaking the law already ? " " Just a little light lawbreaking . Nothing extravagant . " " Well  --  I might check out Jordan 's Cat . " Arthur , without actually doing so , seemed to sniff ironically , as if to say , You know damn well you going to check out Jordan 's Cat . He said , " They wo n't ask me for my draft card in there . And anyway , I can drink ginger ale . You glad to be home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm going to do  --  " " Oh , you 'll figure that out , do n't worry about it now . I 'm sure glad you 're home . I missed you , brother . " " I missed you , too , man . Hand me a towel ? " He handed me a towel and I dried my streaming face and hair and stood up . " See you in a minute , man , " Arthur said , and left me alone.  |p302I  pulled the plug and the water began to slop in thunder through the pipes . I dried myself , staring into the mirror . Martha had written me , saying that she had something to talk to me about but did n't want to go into it in a letter . I wondered what it was ; I thought I could guess , and I wondered how much I cared . I had n't , anyway , cared enough to prevent it , whatever it was : we had agreed , tacitly , that we had no claims on each other . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so fine once I was far away from home and my imagination began to pulse out great jungle flowers in the garden of what might have been . Close up , you see the person 's wrinkles , warts , and pimples ; when close to you , the person has innumerable ways of driving you up the wall : but when far from you , these very same imperfections become irreplaceable and beautiful , testifying , after all , to how much each cared about the other . Close up , the person 's imperfections matter , but , from far away , you see your own . The question then is not How did I stand her ? but How did she stand me ? Well . I wrapped my towel around me , and walked into the incredible luxury of my own bedroom . If it seemed smaller than before , it also seemed more mine than before . It had been scoured , had been put through some changes to be ready for today ; all my things were as I had left them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep in this room while I had been away , not even Arthur . And yet , as I started putting on my own clothes , my own underwear , my own socks , I knew that the time had come for me to leave this room , this house , the time had come for me to leave my father 's house . I realized that , had it not been for the interruption of the war , I might have left already . I was a certain kind of cat . I needed my own place , my own lair , my woman , my cubs : I had bounced around enough to begin to realize that . There was no guarantee , of course , that I would get what I needed : but that was what I needed . I was not at all like Arthur : I had never before looked that fact so squarely in the face . I did not know what Arthur needed , but I knew that , in order to deal with what/ever it was , he needed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , my involuntary and dreadful departure , I might , by now , have arrived at another way of " keeping an eye out " for him : he might , by now , have had two houses instead of one , instead of one brother , other blood relations , claiming him as " uncle . " I was anxious to begin my journey . And now that I was home again , free , my brother was no longer in my way . I felt that I could handle it all  --  cautious I am , but stubborn , too . There was laughter in the living room , and music . Peanut and Arthur were playing records of other quartets . Paul was commenting and , from time to time , I heard my mother 's laughter , sounding the way she must have sounded as a girl . I had brought presents for everyone  --  for everyone , that is , except Peanut  --  and now , not yet completely dressed , I rummaged around in my luggage for something he might like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , monstrously carved pipe for Paul , and a threequarterlength black-and-gold dressing gown for Arthur . I had brought something for Martha and Sidney and Aunt Josephine , but all that I could find for Peanut was a large poster of an Oriental battle which I had liked because of the violence of colors and the fragility of the line . I took all these objects out anyway , and put them on the bed , put on my shirt , put on my shoes , and looked at myself in the mirror as I combed and brushed my hair . You do n't always like what you see in the mirror , but I did that day , since I was home and everything , once again , was up to me . This proves , I imagine , that all you ever really see in your mirror is your state of mind . Leaving that alone : I felt that I , Hall , would be all right , would make no one ashamed of him . At the same time , I was a little afraid to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually the streets , and pick up my life again . Behind my face , there was music , the music from the living room . It was a quartet . I heard ,  |p304Nicodemuswent  to the Lord , he went to the Lordby night . He said , Rabbi , which means Master , wo n't you lead meto the light ? He said , Nicodemus , let me tell youlike a friendyou must beborn again , and I never hearda manspeak like this man ! That sound , the driving sound , always makes me see a black cat , face brilliant and sweating in the sunlight which pours down on his face , pacing , prancing , up a long , high hill . When he stumbles , he does not lean forward ; he arches back , using the misstep to pick up the beat . He is surrounded by people urging him up the hill , they are all around him and behind him , but you do not see them . You know , simply , as he does , that they are present . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is because the sound is black . It is black because the people who have betrayed themselves into being white dare not believe that a sound so rude and horrible , so majestic and universal , can possibly issue from them  --  though it has , and it does ; that is how they recognize it , and why they flee from it : and they will hear it in themselves again , when the present delusion is shattered from the earth . Beneath this sound : Paul 's chuckle , Florence 's laugh , Peanutand Arthur 's deadpan conspiracies , my face  --  I pick up my presents , and walk into the living room . " Well , well , well , " Peanut said mildly . " Do n't look like you going to have any trouble adjusting to civilian life . "  | " Now , you all leave me alone . You do n't know how bad I wanted to get out of that uniform . " " You right . That uniform did n't do nothing for you  --  did n't bring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? But now , with this outfit ! " " Peanut , what makes you so jealous ? " Florence asked . " And when you know the Lord do n't like that ? My children  --  and especially my oldest one , today  --  they just naturally sharp , you might just as well go right on ahead and accept it . " " I accept it , Mama Montana , I was just a little dazzled  --  " " Ai n't no sense in being dazzled , you just go right on ahead and accept it . " She laughed . She was a little tipsy , not so much with wine as with happiness  --  with relief : as though she had been holding her breath all the time I had been gone and could only let it out now . Paul was another matter . He would probably never again take a really deep breath , but he was a happy man today . " I brought you all some presents , " I said . " But if you keep teasing me , you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing . " " You want to do that now ? " Florence asked . " Or you want to wait till after we eat ? I want to get some food in your belly . " " Wo n't take but a minute . " I was nervous , like a child . I concentrated on the packages . " Here , " I said to my mother . " This is for you , " and I gave her the package  --  that is , I reached the package to her and then went over to where she sat on the sofa , and kissed her , and " Here , " I said to Paul , " this is for you , " and I kissed him on the forehead quickly , and " Here , Skeezix , this is for you , " and I dropped the big package into Arthur 's lap , and " Peanut , " I said , " I did n't know I was going to see you today , but I hope you 'll like this . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought it , " and I gave him the rolled-up poster and I sat down in the chair by the door.  | " After all that , " said my father , " before we open the presents , I believe you need a drink . " The table before the sofa was loaded with bottles and trays  --  peanuts , crackers , ham , cheese  --  I had n't even noticedit . " Look like we having a party , " I said . " You right , " Paul said . " We is sure enough having a party . We so glad to see you home , son , do n't none of us know how to act . Do n't even care if you get drunk  --  do n't care if I get a little drunk and you know I ai n't never said nothing like that to you before . How about a little Jack Daniel 's ? Or Cutty Sark ? Been saving it all for you . As you can see , your mama do n't drink "  --  Florence laughed  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles when your brother 's in the house . " " I 'll have a little Cutty , " I said . " With some ice . " My father poured it , and handed it to me . We looked each other in the eye for a second  --  but a very long second : our past , our present , and our future happened in that twinklingof an eye  --  and we all raised our glasses to each other , and drank . I do not know why I felt so keenly that this first homecomingwas also my first farewell . A silence fell . The noises from the street came in . The record player had stopped . Paul took out his pipe , examined it with great respect for a moment , put it between his teeth , and waved one hand at me . In my memory , all this occurred in silence . Arthur took out his Oriental robe and put it on , walking up and down the room , like Yul Brynner , and looking into the mirror . But the only full-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared for a moment . Mama put on her earrings , and Peanut unwrapped his martial scroll . " Let me put the food on the table , " Mama said , and touched her earrings and smiled at me and sashayed into the kitchen . " That 's true enough , " Paul said  --  he was speaking top307Peanut  --  " I can spend the rest of my life and never sit down at a table with white folks  --  but that ai n't really the point . " " Anyway , " Peanut asked , " how many niggers in Washingtongot enough money to go downtown and be de-segregated ? " " Oh , some , " Paul said . " I would n't be surprised if it was n't quite a number  --  but you would n't like them , ei-ther . " " Liking or disliking , " Florence said , " has nothing to do with nothing . I remember when you had to change trains in Washington and go to the Jim Crow car  --  when you would n't be allowed in the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , you do n't want to eat with fools like that  --  but all that 's changed . It do n't mean I want to eat with white people . It just makes life a little easier  --  might make my children 's lives a little easier . Maybe that 's all I want . " " I just do n't find it easy to swallow , " Peanut said . " These people got the gall to claim to be giving us something they did n't never have the right to take away . " He took a swallowof his drink  --  we were at the table , getting some food into our bellies  --  and said , " It ai n't going to make me hold them in no higher esteem , I 'll tell you that right now . " " That 's not the point , son , " Paul said . " It ai n't worth talking about . You ca n't love nobody you ca n't respect . " I thought of some of the Oriental faces I had seen , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whores , and some were grandfathers or grandmothers , and some were children . In the case of the old , the contempt might be leavenedwith pity or , in the case of the children , camouflaged by bewilderment and pain : but the contempt was a constant , at bottom , and bottomless . Not a single white buddy of mine had seen this  --  but then , they had not seen me . " Well , anyway , " Arthur said , " it ought to make things better in the schools . " Peanut grunted . Paul said , " Listen . You all are young . Like it or not , we here now and we ca n't go nowhere else . I was a kind of half-assed Garveyite when I was young  --  youp308would have been , too , had you been young when I was . But you all hardly know who he was , and ai n't no white person going to tell you . All I 'm saying is , you going to have to do what we 've always done , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make what you want . " He looked around the table , but especially at me . " We did n't wait for white people to have a change of heart , or change their laws , or anything , in order to be responsible for each other , to love our women , or raise our children . You better not wait , either . They ai n't going to change their laws for us  --  it just ai n't in them . They change their laws when their laws make them uncomfortable , or when they think they can see some kind of advantage for them  --  we ai n't , really , got nothing to do with it . " " If we had ever , " said Florence , " depended on white folks for anything , there would n't be a black person alive here today . " " Mama , " asked Arthur , " you think they ca n't change ? " She looked down ; then she looked at Arthur . " I 'm saying you ca n't depend on it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one earring . " Anyway , I 'm not really talking about white people . I 've known some white people who were beautiful and some black people who were rats . " She paused , looking at Arthur again . " Look . When was the last time we sat down at this table and talked about white people ? The only reason we talking now is because it looks like they 've decided to desegregate this and desegregate that . I hope they do . It might make life a little easier for you and a little better for them . But we 're not really talking about them : we talking about us . Whatever they do , honey , you still got your life to live . I 'm glad you do n't have to ride in no Jim Crow car , like me and your daddy had to do . But , Jim Crow car or no Jim Crow car , we still had to raise you  --  it was a good thing they changed the law , but we could n't wait for that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So you go on down , and test them waters -- part of the trouble is , you afraid they just might mean it  --  and then ,  |p309how  you going to look at them , how you going to look at yourself ? But just remember  --  it do n't so much matter what they mean to do : it matters what we mean to do . " I said  --  it was partly a question , partly a discovery : " You really mean that , do n't you ? " " Of course , I mean that . How you think we sitting at this table ? You think me or your daddy waited to get permission from some white man ? " She laughed . " Why , honey , they do n't give themselves permission to do much . " She looked very young and happy , her green earrings flashing in the light . " Pass me your brother 's plate , Arthur . I ai n't going to fatten him for the slaughter , but I 'll be damned if I do n't strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to the living room . It was still early , the sun had just gone down . The light in the streets was a kind of gray-purple , the streetlights just beginning to be turned on : you could see them way downtown , beyond the park , creeping uptown . It was very quiet , as though everyone had decided to catch their breath at the same time and were doing what we were doing , just sitting around . I sat at one window , near my father ; my mother sat at the other window . Peanut sat at the piano . Arthur sat on a hassock , his head leaning on the sofa . Peanut was humminga song , " Where He Leads Me , I Will Follow . " Florence hummed along with him . " We ai n't told you about what happened to Julia , " Arthur said . He said it in a strange , dry , distant way , looking up at the ceiling : he said it as though it hurt him . Florence stopped humming . " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dropped out of sight . " " She dropped out of sight , all right , " said Florence . " She was pushed out of sight . " Paul shifted in his seat , started to speak , held his peace . " You wrote me about it , " I said to Arthur , " some time ago . " " That was some time ago . I did n't write you all of it . Allp310of it had n't happened  --  or I did n't know all of it . " He lit a cigarette . " I had just seen her a couple of nights before , down on Fourteenth Street . " He paused . " She had started spending a lot of time down there . " He sat up , his hands clasping his knees . " I 'm sorry , Mama . I did n't mean to interrupt you . " " That 's all right . " Then , " I got this phone call , Hall , early one morning , and I did n't recognize the voice , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming , Mama Montana ! Mama Montana ! and I still did n't recognize it . The voice said , Come up here , please , come up here , please , please , I think I 'm dying . I said , Who is this ? Who is this ? and the moment I asked that , I knew who it was , do n't know how . She said , It 's Julia , Julia , please come , please come , and she started to crying like I hope you ai n't never heard nobody cry . I got into my clothes and ran up there . I took a taxi . " Time I got there , some neighbors had already got into the apartment because she was crying so , and the door was open . And Hall , I never saw nothing like it , not in all my life . You remember how skinny Julia was ? Well , the skinny little thing had been beaten to an inch of her life . Her face , it was n't no face , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have no lips , did n't have no eyes  --  just little dark slits where the eyes was supposed to be . I said , ' Who did this ? ' I thought somebody had broke in and tried to rob them . And she never answered me , she just kept saying , ' I 've lost my baby , I know I 've lost my baby . ' And I was so turned around , Hall , I could n't make no sense of what she was saying . Somebody wanted to call the police , but I said , ' No , let me call the ambulance , we got to get this girl to a hospital . ' So I called the hospital , and , just lucky I got Martha on the telephone . I wrapped up the child as best I could , in blankets  --  and the blood came seeping through those blankets , I just knew she was going to bleed to death  --  and then , for the first time , what she 'd been saying about losing a baby made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said again , ' Who did this ? ' andp311somebody said , ' Her father . Her father beat her , and he gave her that baby , too . ' " Well , I did n't have time to think  --  I could n't think on all that , then . The ambulance came and they put her in the ambulance and I got in with her and rode to the hospital . And thank God Martha was there , or we 'd still be in that hall , answering stupid questions and filling out papers . Martha got rid of all them people and got Julia inside and I sat down on a bench . Everything had happened so fast , was n't nothing clear in my head . " But I sat on that bench for a while . And , look like "  --  she turned away from us , looking out of the window  --  " a whole lot of my life came back to me while I was sitting on that bench . And I lost a baby , too , one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was n't a girl , like Julia , I was married , and it was Paul 's baby and I 'd already had three children . " She caught her breath and looked away again . " And I was a young girl a long time ago , somewhere else . It was n't like some of them young ones sitting on that bench with me , that morning . " Martha came back , and said that Julia had been beaten pretty bad , but that was n't the worst  --  the beating had brought about a miscarriage and Julia was into her third month . They were doing all they could . She might pull through , she might not ; she was a mighty frail girl , and she 'd lost a lot of blood . " Then she asked me to get hold of her father , because he was the next of kin . " She looked me dead in the eye when she said that , like she knew what I was thinking  --  she was remembering , and I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before Amy died  --  and , when she said that , my blood just stopped and froze . I looked at her , but I could n't answer : I could n't pronounce his name , I swear I could n't . Somehow , when Martha asked me that , I knew  --  for the first time , I knew !  --  that everything I 'd been scared to think  --  was true  --  that woman had been telling the truth when she said , Her father , he beat her , and he give her that baby , too . "  |p312Now  it was dark . I could hardly see my mother 's face , or anybody 's face . The streetlights were on . A dim , deep , soft hum of music and voices came in from the streets . Paul turned to me . " Your mama wanted me to find Joel , " he said , " and so I went looking for him . It took me all day . It took me part of a night . He was n't on his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing him , but I went up there , anyway , and almost got arrested . The cops were still there , and they thought I was him . Well . The place was a mess , I mean it was a slaughterhouse , partly from whatever had gone on there that morning , and partly from the cops  --  they had turned out the joint , looking for anything but especially for dope . Hall , there was still blood on one of the windows , blood in the sink , blood on the sofa . And I could see that nobody wanted to believe that a man could do this to his child . It was more like what might happen if a dude just went crazy and came home and bounced everything he could get his hands on off his woman . One of the cops , a black dude , said , ' If this chick 's still breathing , she 's lucky  --  must be they just did n't have no room up top for her yet . ' " But all the neighbors swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody but him . They heard all the noise before he left , and they heard him leave . And then they heard Julia screaming and crying  --  they was there when your mama came  --  they swore it was him . " I did n't want to believe it . Maybe I never thought much of Joel , but I thought more of him than that  --  you just naturallythink more of any man than that . Especially if you know him , or you think you know him , and you 've had drinks with him , and all , and he knows your wife , and your children . And I 'm a father , too  --  no , it was hard for me to believe . But I knew Florence believed it , and she do n't believethings easy . It 's funny "  --  he paused , looked at me , looked away , looked down  --  " I did n't believe it , and yet , I wanted to find that hyena and beat him as bad as he beat Julia and then throw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't believe it , " Florence said , " but you knew it . Just like me . " " Well , I covered Broadway . He used to like to hang out in some of the musician 's joints down there . No dice . I went to the Village . No Joel . Came on back up , going to one place , then going to another , doubling back . Went to Jordan'sCat , although I was pretty sure he would n't be in there . I went back to his house . " I sat down on the top step . I guess my brain was kind of in a turmoil . I just sat there . I figured he was going to have to come here , sooner or later , I even rang the bell . There were no cops around and no cop cars , but I figured that one of the neighbors had arranged to call the police station as soon as he showed up . And , I do n't know why , I figured Joel was just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb to know what people really felt about him while he was carting little Sister Julia around , and him eating out of her hand . Anyway , I sat there , I was tired . " But I was going to be late for work , too , so I went on up to the bar where I was playing then , a few blocks past Jordan'sCat , place called The Window Shades , and , would n't you know , there he was , sitting at the bar . " I 'll never know , until the day I die , if he knew I was playing piano in that bar and was waiting for me , or if he just happened to crawl in there because it was close to home and he was afraid to go home and afraid to be too far from home . I 'll never know . My name was in the window , but , in the state he was in , I doubt that he 'd have noticed that . " He was a mess , too , really , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had some scratches and bruises and his upper lip was swollen  --  but , if you did n't know , he just looked , really , like he 'd been drinking a little too heavy , a little too long . " He looked at me , and I went over . He said , ' Paul , I 'm so glad you came in . I got something to tell you . ' I just looked at him . He said , ' Some people broke in the house thisp314morning , they tried to rob us , and I think they hurt Julia . ' I still just looked at him . He said , ' You know who I think they were ? ' He said , ' Paul , I hate to tell you this , but my daughter  --  Julia '  --  and then he started to cry  --  ' I think she had a nervous breakdown , since her mama died , she ai n't been the same . ' He said , ' Paul , I hate to tell you this about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she been peddling it on the streets , man , and one of her pimps broke in this morning and beat her up . My only daughter . Man . Can you believe it ? And they want me to testify against her . Now , you know I ca n't do that . You ca n't testifyagainst your own flesh and blood , the Bible tells us that 's a sin against the Holy Ghost , you ca n't never be forgivenfor that . ' And he was really crying , real tears was dripping through his fingers , and his shoulders was shaking . " Well . I did n't know if Joel knew it , but I knew that some of the people in that bar lived in his building  --  the cops would soon have his ass . All my anger left me . He really believed his story . I just left him there , went on to my piano . The cops picked him up that night , or soon after  --  they did n't pick him up in the bar  --  but they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were n't no eyewitnesses . Julia could n't talk , and , by the time she could talk , she was in New Orleans  --  her grandmama hustled that child out of here . " No one spoke for a long while . I wondered what Florence was thinking  --  about her old friend , and her friend 's daughter , and granddaughter : I sensed that she was trying to find a key to all this in a past which only she remembered . And she was not sure that she remembered it now  --  she was ransacking the past for the details she had overlooked . " Well , " Florence said finally , " she never wanted to say nothing against her father  --  maybe because it was n't just her father . Anyway , " she added , after a moment , " she never did . And I guess we have to respect that . " " It was Crunch 's baby , " Arthur said . " When Julia couldp315talk , and I went to see her at the hospital , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmama , she did n't bring little Jimmy back with her ? " " Of course not , " Florence said . " What for ? She left him with some of their relatives down there . " " Poor Jimmy , " Arthur said . " One thing for sure , " I said . " She must have damn sure wanted it to be Crunch 's baby . " Arthur nodded at me , emphatically , his eyes very big and bright , and older than I had ever seen them . Peanut said , " You mean that Brother Joel Miller was sleeping with his own daughter ? I did n't hear that ! " " What did you hear , " Arthur asked , " way down there in Washington ? " " It 's a small world . " Peanut glanced at Florence , then at Paul . " I heard  --  she 'd been turning tricks  --  you know , like Brother Miller said  --  with white men , down on the Bowery , and in the Village , and Brother Miller found out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he beat her up . " Well , " said Paul , " look like his story 's the one that got sold . Anyway , he 's still around . You go out tonight , you might run into him . The women still like him . " " How much does Crunch know about this ? " I asked Arthur . " Well  --  I think he knows that Julia was going to have a baby by him , and she lost it . " He hesitated . " He had told me about  --  their affair  --  before he left here . " He lit a new cigarette from the coal of an old one , stubbed out the old one in the ashtray on the coffee table . He looked up at me . " Crunch do n't say a whole lot in his letters  --  I was the only one writing him , really , and I do n't know what Julia told him . I did n't think it was for me to tell him ! " I said , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . " Peanut looked at Arthur . " Your heart , " said Peanut , and smiled . Then , " Sure wish I had some news from Red . But Ip316really have my doubts , man , that he ever learned to write . " Peanut and Arthur laughed together . " They both be coming home soon , " Arthur said . " Do n't worry . We be seeing them any day now . " Paul looked over at Arthur . " Come on and play something for us . Your brother ai n't heard your voice in a long time  --  and , I know , once he hits them streets , he going to be out there for a while  --  move your behind , Peanut . I do n't think Hall ever heard his brother sing and play at the same time . " Peanut moved , and Arthur rose . " Okay , I 'll do my best . " He grinned at me . " But you just remember , this is a command performance  --  you might just have to grit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . " For you , brother . " I sat in the window , watching him  --  space at my back , my arms folded , watching him . He looked down at the keyboard , strummed the keys ; it was a different face than I had seen before , and it was a different sound . He turned his face for a second and looked at me , then turned again to the keyboard . His face changed again . Shine , looking at me for a second , and at the space behind me , then back down to the keyboard , on me . I watched his fingers on the keyboard . His eyes were closed . Shineon me . I watched his face and his hands , as though I had never seen them before , and felt him beginning to drag his song up out of me . Let the lightfrom the lighthouseshine on me . It was more than strange how the two voices came together , one issuing through his fingers , the other through his throat , both from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the vast and unmapped geography of himself , he sang , for us , our song . I watched his face , and I really wondered how anybody could bear that . Let itshineon me ! Oh , let it shineon me . I want , the piano rolling like a river , the light from the lighthouse , the voice rising out of our whirlwind , the whirlwind transfiguringArthur 's face , to shine on me . He opened his eyes for a moment , as though to check the distance from one place to another , looked down , began again . I heard the voice of Jesus say , and out of the space beneath , behind me , I heard a cheerful black lady 's voice , a little drunken , calling out to another black lady , and I heard their laughter , come unto Me , and rest . I watched Paul 's dark face watching his son 's dark face . I did not dare look at my mother , I do n't know why . I had the feeling that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dared not look behind me , dared not look down . Lie down , thou weary one , lie downthy head upon my breast . The noise of the traffic on the streets rang upward . I could see the stoplights on the corner , flashing green , flashing red , and automobiles , with shells like beetles , or dinosaurs , massed together , waiting , or , abruptly liberated , careening off into whatever the future held.  |p318Shine  on me , shine on me , oh , the thundering , racing , calling piano now the only voice , then , let the light , the piano lower , slower , Arthur 's voice rising , from the lighthouseshineon me , and he stopped , looking toward me , after a moment , smiling . I had to shake my head to bring him into focus : I had n't known that my eyes were wet . I knew he wanted me to say something , but I did n't have anything to say . Trying to conquer distance , I came out of the window and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll buy you a drink . I do n't mind breaking the law for a real , honest-to-God law-breaker . " I looked at Paul , and Paul grinned saying many things to me in a split second : " Yes . I believe they might be expecting to see you up the road . " " Who knows I 'm home ? " Arthur rose from the piano , he and Peanut looked at each other and slapped palms together , and Paul laughed with them . " Oh , " they said , more or less in unison , " just a couple of people , do n't you worry about it , they going to recognizeyou , and I do believe they know you 're home ! " I looked at my mother . " Oh , yes , son , " said Florence . " I believe the news is out . " Presently , we started rolling toward Jordan 's Cat , Peanut , again , at the wheel . And now , I found that I was really frightened  --  I felt , to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha , she did n't know I was home ( but of course she knew I was home ! ) and , though I could have , I had n't called her . I had justified this by telling myself that I did n't need to , orp319did n't have any right . This utterly threadbare proposition failed to explain why I had n't written or called Sidney . Perhaps my real intention was to catch them in the act ( what act ? ) thus taking myself off the hook . ( But I had made it very clear , before I left , that I had not been hooked . ) I could scarcely believe that I could be so base  --  could see , somewhere , so much , and yet , face so little . Yet here I was , in the ancient , blue Pontiac , rolling toward Jordan 's Cat , just like Enoch Arden , ready to confront my friend and my lover with the unanswerable truth of their betrayal of my  --  after all  --  indispensable person . I hoped that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my paranoia : that the one might cancel out the other . With another part of my mind , I was horrified by what had happened to Julia , and  --  though , again , this sounds insane  --  lesshorrified by what had happened to Julia than by what might be happening to Arthur . To Arthur , that is , as a result . Arthur , with me , anyway , was exceedingly laconic , all the days of his life . I saw some things  --  later ; when I began to run with him , I saw a lot . Yet , really , when I find myself testifying on Judgment Day , I wo n't know what I can say I know about anybody else 's life , including Arthur 's : I do n't know what I know about my own . I put a certain kind of picture together  --  in time out of the fragments Arthur let me see , or could n't hide , or what I divined . If I can say , I think I knew him , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was n't in his skin , or in his beds , or in his voice . I saw Crunch , for example , through his eyes , much later , too late : I do n't know that I ever saw the Crunch he saw , but I think I saw what Crunch meant to him . ( I saw what Arthurmeant to Crunch : Arthur did n't . ) And , if I saw Jimmy more clearly , that is really because I was finally growing up , and , much more importantly , Julia and I had been lovers long before Jimmy and Arthur made it . Well . Here we are now , at Jordan 's Cat . I had brought the present for Sidney  --  a heavy brass ring , in the shape of a serpent , with a scarlet eye  --  but had not brought Martha 's present , telling myself that it was too bigp320to carry , which it was n't . ( It was a heavy , ornate , green silk kimono : I had left it lying on my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when I gave it to her . It did n't seem right to give it to her in public . As we got out of the car , I realized that I was terribly afraid . I did not know what was about to happen to me . Arthur was wearing a dark blue suede jacket with a belt . It looked very nice on him , made him look taller , and grown-up . He opened the door , and we went inside . I think everyone imagines that , when they go away , the scene they have left behind them alters , that their departure leaves a hole in their previous surroundings . The departure may leave a hole in some people 's lives , a wound which is invisible ; but one 's surroundings take as little notice of one 's departure as the sea takes of the dead . The scene rolls on , the music keeps playing , no one misses a beat . Children continue , relentlessly , to be conceived ; ruthlessly , to be born ; and are there when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have not returned : although they just got here , it is you who have arrived . Paradoxically , then , this means that every scene is new . That is the only way to play it , though it seemed to me that everything and everyone at Jordan 's Cat remained exactly as they had been when I left . The jukebox had not changed position , the tables in the back were still there , it was not the same waitress , but she looked the same . George was nowhere in evidence , but it was probably his night off . The photographs on the wall behind the bar were still there , the same number of them , and the clock was still ten minutes fast . The jukebox was n't playing the same tune , certainly , but the beat was still the same . It was crowded , electrical , with voices and laughter  --  perhaps what had once seemed elegance was , now , a little frayed . Arthur teased and muscled his way to the bar  --  a very impressive display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look who we brought to see you ! " Sidney did n't answer at once  --  he was at the cash regis/ter . He rang up the bill , turned to place it on the bar before the customer , and looked straight into my eyes . I realized that he had seen me when I came in . He grinned , and tapped Arthur on the cheek  --  " I saw you sneaking in here ! "  --  and reached out for me and managed to put one hand on the nape of my neck . He held me like that for a moment , looking into my eyes with a smile . " Welcome home , brother , " he said . " You just get in ? " " Yeah . Just today . " " How 's the folks ? I ai n't talking about small fry , here  --  this young , dumb , full-of-come turkey  --  how are Papa and Mama Montana ? " " They fine . How are you ? " He held me for yet another moment . " I know they mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " I 'm all right . I 'm fine . I 'm mighty glad to see you , too , man . " It came to me that something had happened to Sidney  --  something beautiful : something calm in his eyes , somethingloving in his smile . His hair was still conked , but  --  I do n't know why  --  I had the feeling that he was half-hearted about it now , that it would n't stay conked long . " I brought you something , " I said . " Wait . Wait till I buy you a drink in the back . What you drinking now ? " He looked at Arthur . " You lucky you with your brother , son . " Arthur laughed . " This here 's a friend of mine , Peanut . Peanut , this is Sidney . " Sidney and Peanut shook hands , and , again , I felt a kind of peace in Sidney which I had never felt in him before . " I hope , " he said , " you know what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks . " These are the terribleMontana brothers , ai n't left a woman standing from coast to coast . " He scowled , hideously , at Arthur , and poured him a glass of white wine . " This is just for your brother 's homecoming . Now go stand in a corner , with your face to the wall . " He looked back to me , still with thisp322imitation scowl on his face . " I 'll be with you , fast as I can . Hey . You call Martha ? " I said , feeling foolish , " Not yet  --  " He watched me , smiling . I could think of nothing more to say . " We love you , " he said . " Please call her , she 's expecting your call  --  you need a dime ? Here , " he said , before I could start searching my pockets , " go on and call her . I 'll see you in a minute . You , " he said to Arthur , " make yourself useful and take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the bar and went to the phone booths which were way in the back , near the toilets and the kitchen . I was out of breath . I felt childish , even base  --  vanity was the word ringing , senselessly , in my mind . I put the coin in the slot , and dialed the number , seeing Arthur and Peanut , guided by the waitress , take a table next to the jukebox . Peanut and Arthur and the waitress appeared to have hit it off , the three of them were cracking up with laughter . The phone rang twice , three times  --  then , " Hello ? " I had forgotten the eager little girl pulsing at the bottom of that voice , the voice of a little girl who had , maybe , smoked a little too much , and drunk a little too much  --  and cried a little too much , too  --  and who yet believed , at the very bottom of her voice , that something marvelous might happen each time she picked up the telephone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Hall . Where are you ? Are you home ? " " This afternoon . " " In New York  --  ? Where are you ? " " In New York . " I cleared my throat . " I 'm at Jordan 's Cat . " " Oh . So you 're with Sidney  --  " " And my brother , Arthur , and an old friend of ours  --  " " Why did n't you call me before ? " " I do n't know . " Then , thank God , I told the truth . " I was afraid . " " Afraid ? Why ? " Then , " Oh , never mind . That was a stupidquestion . But do n't be afraid . There 's nothing to be afraid of , believe me . I 'd love to see you . Can I come over ? "  |p323I  said , " Yes , I wish you would . I 'd love to see you . " Then I said , " I brought you a present , but I left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be right there . " " Okay  --  Martha ? " " Yes ? " " Forgive me for being so foolish . " Then I did n't know what to say  --  I caught my breath to keep myself from crying . " You 're not foolish . You 're you  --  Hall ? " " Yes . " " I 'll be right there . Order me  --  oh , a double daiquiri or something . " She laughed . " Oh , and Hall ? " " Yes ? " " Love goes through a lot of changes , but love never dies . You 'll see . " " I believe you , mama , " I said . " God bless you . In a minute , then , " and I hung up . I hung up , and started getting ready to hang out . Love , which I really knew nothing about yet , had put me through some changes , and yet , was beginning to set me free . What a wonder , what a marvel , yes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what on earth I was to do with my freedom . I walked past Arthur and Peanut , picking up my drink along the way , and walked to the bar . I signaled Sidney . " And what can I do for you , sir ? "  --  grinning . " She wants a double daiquiri , or something like that  --  on the rocks , maybe , I do n't remember . " Sidney laughed . " Got you , " he said , and turned away . It struck me for the first time  --  consciously  --  that the world is not overpopulated with those on whom you can , laughingly , and in perfect confidence , turn your back . I did n't want to rejoin Arthur and Peanut right away . I wanted one says , to think , but that really refers to the need to make some kind of private assessment . I certainly did n't have much time for it , with Peanut and Arthur at the table , Sidney at the bar , and Martha on her way . No : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that you must look outp324and I stalled for time , wandering over to the jukebox . That way , it could n't seem that I was avoiding anybody . I stood at a slight angle to the box , my drink in one hand , my change in the other . I was looking at the numbers on the jukebox , and I was watching the crowd . I knew , if I decided to , I could get something going . What could I get going ? For I was no longer the same person who had been here before . I watched , for example , the waitress : a pretty girl , lightskinned  --  askin somewhat darker than bananas  --  with dark brown eyes and reddish hair , hair cooked , teased , and tormentedinto a kind of cotton-candy texture , cut short or piled high ; it was exceedingly hard to guess what would happen to this confection in the rain . She had a kind of low-slung behind , not big , but present , and sturdy bowlegs , and she was a good waitress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , and the people . She had had to pay some dues to have arrived at even this brutally limited shadow of authority . She was somebody 's daughter certainly , maybe somebody 's sister , maybe somebody 's woman , victim , or hope , or model , maybe , even , somebody'smother . She had probably not been born in New York . Had she walked all the way here ? Why ? Yet , in the state in which I knew I would soon find myself , she would be nothing more than an opportunity , a means of reassurance , or , really , not even that  --  a means of physical release , a way of dropping my load . Once that had been accomplished , my curiosity about her , my concern , would diminish as inexorably as my softening dick . How did she bear being used like that ? For I was really thinking of Martha . And the truth was this : I had not exactly , for reasons of vanity , allowed myself to hope to find myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And not because she was Martha . I was beginning to see that I had never been terribly concerned with knowing who Martha was ; on the contrary , I had resisted any such intrusion  --  then I would have had to confess who I was . No : I simplyp325wanted to have been with her tonight because it would have been easy , it would have been enormously gratifying still to be wanted after so long , because I had already been there and would not have had to battle for the conquest , because , sometimes , we had been so good together , making love . This memory tiptoed along my spine as I stood there at the jukebox , watching the crowd . The crowd . It came to me that I could spend my life doing what I was doing right now . The world was full of crowds , waitresses , beds , girls , women , boys , men  --  maybe , even , full of Marthas . How would I ever know so long as I was determined not to know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed recklessly , at random , trying to make it seem that I was making choices . But the truth was that I saw absolutely nothing , was , simply , as I hoped , covering myself . And would I spend my life in postures so unmanly , my face at an angle to the music and at an angle to the crowd ? And I had fucked everything I could get my hands on overseas , including two of my drinking buddies . I had been revolted  --  but this was after , not before , the act . Before the act , when I realized from their eyes what was happening , I had adored being the adored male , and stretched out on it , all boyish muscle and throbbing cock , telling myself , What the hell , it beats jerking off . And I had loved it  --  the adoration , the warm mouth , the tight ass , the fact that nothing at all was demanded of me except that I shoot my load , which I was very , very happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not merely because it really was not for me , but because I had used somebody merely as a receptacle and had allowed myself to be used merely as a thing . I was revolted that my need had driven me , as I considered it , so low : nevertheless , my need had driven me and could drive me there again . And what did a woman feel ? I had never asked myself this question before . Women like it as much as men , okay , and a stiff prick has no conscience , okay again , but that merely justifies a grim indolence . I could spend myp326whole life in that posture and be found standing at this jukebox when Gabriel 's trumpet sounded , at an angle to the music and at an angle to my life . So then , for the first time , I wondered about love and wondered if I would find in myself the strength to give love , and to take it : to accept my nakedness as sacred , and to hold sacred the nakedness of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a foul taste on the palate , and pleasure 's inventions are soon exhausted . There must be a soul within the body you are holding , a soul which you are striving to meet , a soul which is striving to meet yours . Then I suspected why death was so terrible , and love so feared  --  glimpsed an abyss and closed my eyes and shuddered : but I had seen it . Then , having spent all my change ( I was going to have to get a job ! ) I went back to the table and summoned the beautifuland mysterious waitress , and ordered another round . When she brought the round , I asked her , " Where 're you from , child ? " She put her hands on her hips and grinned at me . She had a gap between her two front teeth . It made her face funny instead of merely pretty , the gap was like a bonus . " Waycross , Georgia , " she said . " Now ai n't that some-thing ? " We all laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You folks up here , " she said , " always wondering about how we got out . Ai n't you never worried about how we going to get in ? I 'm tired of being out . " " Amen to that , " said Arthur . " And let the church say amen ! " " But I wonder , sometimes , " I said , teasing , " how we going to get over . " " Oh , we over , " she said . " We been over . You notice how white folks do n't never use that word like we use it ? They afraid of being over . And they right . That 's how I know we got over . " She laughed again , all over her mischievous pick/aninny 's face , and under all that cotton-candy hair . " But sometime soon , I 'd still like to make it on in . " " Into the kingdom ? " Arthur asked this with a smile . " That one up yonder ?  --  not hardly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know those folks ca n't sing . " She and Arthur and Peanut laughed together . " And they could n't get a spare rib or a pork chop together if their souls depended on it "  --  we all laughed again  --  " and they do n't know nothing about chitterlings . " " You 're crazy , " I said . " Why , no , I 'm not , " she said , and looked directly at me , a beautiful , searching , open look . " I just do n't see any reason to go up yonder with them people who done already drove me half crazy down here . And who have drove themselves completely crazy . " She picked up her tray , and started to move . Someone had called her : her name , I gathered , was Thomasina . " So I ai n't too much interested in this kingdom down here , neither  --  I 'm coming ! " she shouted . " But my grandmama , down in Waycross , she told me , we got a kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you in a minute , folks , " she said , and went to serve another table . " Well , she do n't hardly want to be desegregated , " Peanut said . " What 's wrong with her ? " " I see , " said Sidney , abruptly looming over the table and then sitting down at it , " that you trying to get next to my waitress . But I can tell you right now that she ai n't hardly thinking about none of y'all . " " Hands off , " said Peanut . " Am I right ? " Sidney grinned , looking quickly at me and then back to Peanut . " Oh , no , " he said . " She do n't belong to me . I just happen to know that she is occupied . Anyway , " he added , looking at Arthur with pity and then grinning at Peanut , " she say she do n't want no more children . You got that , junior ? " Arthur watched him with a small , stubborn smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surprise the hell out of your ass . " " You sure give Arthur a hard time , " Peanut said.  | " Ai n't been doing a thing in the world , " said Sidney , " but trying to keep his dumb ass out of trouble while his big brother was away . " And he suddenly laughed and grabbed Arthur and kissed him on the forehead . " Now ai n't that true ? Go on , now , tell the truth and shame the devil . " Arthur grinned , but most unwillingly , weakly resisting Sidney 's grasp . " My brother do n't never talk to me like that . " " Ah , " said Sidney . " That 's what 's wrong with you . He been polite . But I will call you a motherfucker and kick your ass . " He let Arthur go , and turned to me . " That 's just because I love you both . " I said , " I guess a lot 's been happening since I 've been gone . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Depends . " " Depends ? " " Well , yes . It depends partly on what you want to happen , partly on what you afraid might happen  --  and mostly on what you do n't see coming . " I watched him with a smile and took the box with his ring in it out-of my pocket and put it on the table . " This is for you , man . I hope you like it . " Arthur and Peanut watched , smiling , as Sidney took the box and held it for a moment between his two big hands . " If I do n't like it  --  can I trade it in ? " " Go on , man , " said Arthur , " and open the box . " Sidney smiled at me , unreadably , as he undid the packageand opened the box . He took out the ring and held it for a moment in the center of his palm  --  " That 's beautiful ! " Arthursaid  --  and then slipped it , finally , on his fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . He stretched out his arm to admire his hand and looked at me again . " It is beautiful , " he said . " Thank you , brother . " Something seemed to thunder in the air between us for a second , something both troubling and peaceful , and we both smiled . " I 'll send Thomasina over with drinksp329for you people , " he said . " I do n't drink no more while I 'm working . " I had the feeling , from something intense in his eyes , that he wanted to say more , but he stopped and stood up . " I 'm going back to work . Listen . You and Martha going to stay here with small fry , or you going to find someplace quiet ? " " I guess , " I said , " that we 'll find someplace quiet . " " Well . We 'll figure it out when she gets here , " and he stroked my cheek with his ring hand and went back to the bar . Arthur was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic with his effort to conceal worry . I wanted to reassure him , but I could n't  --  that would have been jumping the gun . I wondered what he was thinking , what he had seen , what he knew ; realized , again , that no one had mentioned Martha to me , and no one had mentionedSidney . They could n't : and if they could n't , they knew that I would soon see why . I felt , now , that I might be in for a fairly rough five minutes . I knew that I did n't know how I was going to handle it , but I did n't feel that it would be worse than that , or more than that . Then something seemed to charge the air at my back and something happened in Arthur 's eyes , and I knew that Martha had arrived . Without turning my head , I could see her , as on that Christmas night we had first come here , leaning up on the bar , on tiptoe , to kiss Sidney on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laughter , the same but not the same , and see their faces : Martha 's bright from the chilly wind and Sidney 's , a little dulled with fatigue and yet , beautifully heavy with hope . Then it was real to me that time had passed and that , yes , something had been lost . Or : perhaps I had lost something , but something had also been gained . For now , Arthur looked at me with a look he could never have had before  --  a look warning , apprehensive , amused , and resigned  --  and said , " Martha 's here , brother . " It was as though he simply did not want me to bep330caught unawares : the rest was up to me . And , with that look , he told me not merely what he knew about my immediatesituation but also what he had begun to discover about many things in the time I had been gone . And so , I turned in my seat , making myself ready , not yet daring to stand  --  not certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big a deal out of her arrival : when I had had that right , I had n't used it  --  and turned my face to the bar , smiling , as she turned from the bar and started toward us . She was smiling , the happiest smile I had ever seen on her , she was wearing a navy blue dress and a tan raincoat , her skin was glowing and her hair a little tousled from the wind . She was a little older , she was exceedingly handsome , and I was very glad to see her . I stood up , and she put her arms around me and I took her in my arms . It was not the same , but it was all right , it was better than all right . " My God , " she said , " you 're here at last ! We missed you , and we talked about you , I even took up prayer ! " She pulled back , with her hands on my shoulders , to look at me . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and mine , and Aunt Josephine 's  --  but , otherwise  --  ! " " No visible scars , " I said . " Ah , but the invisible ones !  --  we 'll get to that , later . " She turned to Arthur and Peanut , who were standing . " I 'm not sure , " she said to Arthur , " that I 'm still talking to you , but I 'll give you a hug , just for old times ' sake . Just because I know it would n't be right to beat you up in front of your brother his first day home . " She and Arthur laughed , and hugged each other . Arthur said , " I do n't know if you 've met my friend , Peanut , we used to sing together  --  " " Oh "  --  with a quick look at me  --  " but I 've heard of Peanut , believe me . " They shook hands . " Sit down , please . " I helped her off with her coat , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Peanut took her coat from me and hung it up . Thomasina appeared with her tray , and began putting our drinks on the table . Sidney had sent me a double Scotch , and Martha 's daiquiri , I noticed , had turned out into an old-fashioned . Arthur hadp331been demoted to ginger ale , and Peanut was drinking beer . " We going to drink up quick , " said Arthur , " and leave you two alone . Or we can go to the bar right now . " Martha gave him a look . " Arthur , you just want to hit the streets , do n't you be jiving me . You was never worried about leaving us alone before . " She raised her glass , first to Peanut , then to Arthur , then to me : " To the one who has come home . " Her face , then , became a face I did not yet know but was to come to know  --  to meet  --  in the years stretching before us . It was the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely putting her girlhood behind her , insofar , at least , as she could then know . It was the first time I saw the face of the black girl-woman we would meet all up and down those dusty chain-gang highways , in years to come , for years to come . The face was as intransigent as it was vulnerable , the very definition of nobility  --  take all you have , and give to the poor , but do n't bring any of that shit near me . I once was lost , but now I 'm found . I raised my glass : " To being home again , with those I love . " We drank , and Martha and I stared at each other  --  for what I thought was a very brief moment but it was long enough for both Arthur and Peanut to drain their glasses , and stand up . And they left Martha and I there , alone . " So , " I said . " Where shall we begin ? " " Well , " Martha said , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget all about Alice in Wonderland  --  the end is not in sight and the beginning is a long time ago . " We laughed together , but I did not want to prolong her gallant agony . I watched her face . She was older , yes , but it was n't really time which had happened in her face  --  there had not , after all , been that much time  --  what had happenedspoke of lonely , melancholy decision . The price was written in the jawbone and the cheekbone , in the not-quitefalsedirectness and tranquillity of the eye . Not quite false because too hard won : the struggle was more vivid than the victory.  |p332Yet  the struggle was itself a kind of victory and only that involuntary depth of love which I knew I did not feel for her could dare attempt distinguish the will from the deed . I offered her a cigarette , but she waved her hand and smiled no , and we sipped our drinks for a moment . Everything around us was very quiet suddenly , as though invisible multitudes awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That letter you did n't write me  --  was about you and Sid-ney ? " " Yes . Not exactly . It was about much more than that  --  but , yes , I wanted to tell you about  --  me and Sidney . " Martha 's eyes , at that moment , were so beautiful and so bright with pain that I could scarcely believe my eyes . I had never seen such nakedness before in the eyes of anyone I loved , or in anyone 's eyes . It made me very happy that anyonecould look like that , could love like that , and , at the same time , it frightened me , too . " Well , Martha  --  why could n't you write me ? About you and Sidney , I mean ? I do n't have any claim on you . We agreed about that when I left here . " " Yes . You said it , and I agreed . Only  --  you did n't really say it , not in so many words , and so I could n't really agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " After all  --  I had to think that  --  one of the reasons you did n't want us to have any claims on each other  --  was that you thought you might not be coming back . Or that you would be coming back with one leg or no eyes  --  who knows what you were thinking ? But that 's what I was thinking . And I did n't even know that I was thinking that  --  until  --  " and she stopped . " I think we should get out of here , " I said . " I 'll bring you back , or we can tell Sidney where to meet us . " " That 's a good idea , " she said , and so we rose and started making our way out of there . We had n't quite decided where we were going , but we told Sidney that we 'd call him.  |p333We  went to a very quiet kind of cocktail lounge near 125th Street on Seventh , and sat in a booth way in the back , alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little above our age and station . The waitress came , and we ordered our drinks . We sat in a charged and friendly silence , listening to Ella Fitzgerald on the jukebox . " Are you two planning to get married ? " I asked . " I guess so . I hope so . " She grinned . " We 're much more old-fashioned than you . " I grunted . " You want to bet ? I 'm just a late starter , that 's all . " " Anyway . After you left , I hardly saw Sidney at all . Maybe just instinctively , we avoided each other . I never went into Jordan 's Cat , and we never even ran into each other in the street , even though we live in the same neigh-borhood . " I wanted to tease her a little : " What do you mean  --  you ' instinctively ' avoided each other ? " " Oh , come on , you know damn well what I mean . " We both laughed . The waitress came , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ella Fitzgerald gave way to the voice of Pearl Bailey . " It was n't all that funny , then , " she said carefully . " I did n't know where you 'd left me  --  but  --  you 'd left me not liking myself very much . " I said nothing . There was nothing for me to say . " I did n't want to blame you  --  and I did n't want to start blaming men  --  so I worked hard , and spent most nights home . " She laughed . " Aunt Josephine was most upset . " I felt an odd , lonely spasm of regret at her refusal to place the blame , at the same time that I was compelled to respect her . But I also felt , irrationally , that this refusal to place the blame could be seen as a way of demolishing my manhood . Certainly a man looks sharply at a woman who refuses to place the blame on him ! " I did n't really see Sidney until after Julia 's father beat her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she picked up herp334drink and looked down into it , then looked up at me  --  " they told you about all that ? " " Oh , yeah . They told me about it . " " When that first day was over  --  because that shit went on for days , we did n't know whether Julia was going to live or die , and her father was a revelation , baby , I never saw anything like it  --  but I 'll tell you about that another day  --  your mama and I just walked down the road to Jordan 's Cat and sat down . Neither of us said a word , nobody said , Let 's have a drink . We just walked to the nearest bar and sat down . " And you know I was n't hardly thinking about Sidney . I was thinking about that girl , and her father . And I was sick . Your mama and I were both sick . And we knew already was n't nothing going to happen to him . They could n't hold him , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched something enter Martha 's face , and it caused a silence in me . My mother , her mother , Julia  --  at least three women entered Martha 's face , all of them appalled by Julia 's bloody passage into womanhood . Their eyes were all fixed on something which , perhaps , no man could see . Joel was indeed , for example , as Martha said , a revelation  --  I would never have used that word : I did not know which , for her , of the seven seals had been broken . Joel appalled the man in me , he made me sick with shame ; but I had placed , with speed , so vast a distance between his manhood and my own that he could not threaten me , he had no power over me ; and this could not be true for any woman . I could divorce myself from Joel . They could not divorce themselves from Julia . More precisely , perhaps , it was n't hard for me to protect myself against the possible Joel in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so easy , as I now saw , for Martha to obliterate from her days or from her nights the cord that connected her to the brutally broken virgin . So we sat in silence for a while . It was getting late , past one A.M. From far away , we heard the voice of Frank Sinatra . I signaled the waitress for another round . She came ,  |p335with  this silence ringing still , and took away our empty glasses , and Martha finally lit a cigarette . " I do n't think Mama Montana and I said more than two words to each other . We just ordered our drinks , and sat there , like zombies . Then Sidney came in , and "  --  Martha laughed  --  " it was as though he woke us up . We realized , for the first time , where we were , and we looked at each other as if to say , How did we get here ? Like in the fairy tales , you know ? when the Prince comes along and he waves his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she laughed again , and the waitress came back and set our drinks before us , along with new potato chips , and smiled tolerantly at us , as though she took us for newlyweds , or lovers . " Sidney was very nice during that whole time , and your mama liked him a lot . And that meant something , I must say "  --  she leaned forward , gesturing with her newly lit cigarette  --  " because I trust your mama . " I said , I could n't help it , " Sure . She treated Sidney like a son . " Then I said , " I 'm sorry . Go on . " " You should be , " she said , refusing to be checked . " After all , you treat him like a brother . " She paused , narrowing her eyes , both shrewd and mocking . " Do n't you ? " She was calling up my promissory notes . " Yes , " I said , " I do . " She was silent for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We started going out here and there  --  a movie , a concert , sometimes I 'd come and have a drink with him at the end of the bar . Somehow , sitting at the end of that bar at night made me very happy because I knew that he was happy to see me there , just sitting there , even though he was always busy and we could n't talk much . " " It was sitting at the end of the bar , " I said , " that did it . " And I was not being mocking . I could see it . " Yes , " she said . She looked down . " He needed me . I made him happy . I made a difference in his life . " She looked up , into my eyes . " And that made a difference in my life . And  --  we had n't yet touched each other , I tall . "  |p336She  looked around the bar , looking , again , at something I could n't see . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , about you and me . I saw that I had been dreaming . It was n't because of Korea that you did n't want to marry me  --  " " I never said that , Martha . Be fair . " She smiled . " Be fair ! " Then , " No . But that was in the background , that was always  --  unspoken . Anyway , " she said . " Remember that I 'm not blaming you . For anything . " It was true . It was not true . I watched her eyes . I held my peace . She looked at her watch , and sipped her drink . " I began to see , anyway , that you would never want to marry me , there would always be something in the way . Well . I began to see that I 'd been dreaming  --  dreaming that when you came home , with all the battles over , and the danger behind , you would feel that you had the right to ask me to marry you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a nice dream , though . It kept me going through some rough days , I can tell you . But  --  " " The dreamer awoke , " I said . " Yes , " she said soberly , after a moment , " the dreamer awoke . " I watched her . I really did not know what I felt , and I decided that I would not try to find out now . I would sort it out later . I had the feeling that something , something very clear , had yet eluded me . " Is Sidney going to stay on at the bar , " I asked , " after you 're married ? " " No . " Her face changed again , with a warm , wondering , private smile . She touched her drink . " I may never have another drink . " She put her cigarette into the ashtray . " I may never smoke another cigarette or "  --  she looked around the bar  --  " sit in another place like this again . " I laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was frightened . " Are you going to become ap337Seventh-Day Adventist , or something , or "  --  I stopped laughing  --  " or what ? " She was quite untouched by my laughter . She was radiant . " Sidney 's studying for us to change our lives  --  to change the lives of all black people in this country . Especiallyblack men , that 's the key . " She gave me a mocking , affectionatesmile . " He might change you , too . " Now I was perfectly sober , intent , watching her . " I know Sidney never told you this , but I know it 's all right if I tell you now  --  he 's not hiding it anymore . " She paused . " Sidney has a younger brother in prison  --  did you know that ? " " No , " I said , " I did n't . " Then , " My brother , Sidney , never told me he had another brother . " " Well . He has . And for the past year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney sees his brother , all he can talk about is the Messenger from Allah , about Islam , and how this truth , after all these centuries of lies , has helped him clean up his life . And Sidney says it 's true  --  his brother , who went to jail for murder , is a changed man . But Sidney will tell you , he 's been dying to tell you . And I 've read some of his brother 's letters and they started me thinkingin an entirely new direction . " She watched my face , and laughed , then sobered . " No , I 'm not crazy , but I 'll let Sidneyexplain it to you  --  he 's studying , he spends every spare minute with his Muslim brothers , and it 's made him a changed man , too . " She paused , and then said proudly , " And if I 'm going to be his wife , his helpmeet  --  well then , I must begin my studies , too . " I simply looked at her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all new to me . I never heard anything about this . " " But it 's not new . It 's old . It 's thousands of years old . It 's just been hidden from us . " No doubt , I still looked numb . " Look , the truth about black people has always been hidden from us , that 's how we got so messed up . But the Messengerof Allah knows the truth . " " And this is a man  --  a living man ? "  | " A living black man  --  right here in the United States . " " I think I better have another drink , " I said , " quick , andyou better have one , too . Sounds like your drinking daysare almost done . " She laughed . " Why are you so frightened ? You look absolutelyterrified . " " I am terrified . The truth is supposed to terrify . " I asked the waitress for one more round , and I asked her to make mine a double . Martha watched me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her watch again . " I 'd better call Sidney . What are we going to do ? " " I 'll take you back to the bar , and Sidney and I will make arrangements to discuss this Muslim shit more thoroughly . " " Very well , " she said , and took a dime from her purse and went to telephone Sidney . I walked her up to Jordan 's Cat in silence . I did n't want to be silent , but I did n't know what to say : and I did n't want her to talk . I kept thinking about what she had said , and more , the way she had said it ; it kept turning and turning in my mind the way a heavy object in the water is pushed and pulled about . It would not sink , it would not stop moving . So , when I got to the bar , I said to Sidney , " I hear you got something to lay on me , brother . " Sidney gave me the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and said , " I believe I do . " " You want to talk later ? " " You go get some sleep . I 'll pick you up at your house around six , okay ? " " Okay . " And so I left them and started for my house . I did n't get there right away , I got drunk but I did n't get laid  --  I could n't have , I was watching everything and everyone from too great a distance , I kept hearing Martha 's voice and seeing her face  --  and that was the end of my first day home.  |p339Sidney  called me to say he 'd meet me at a joint on 110th Street and Lenox Avenue , next to the subway station . I was alone in my house . Florence , Paul , and Arthur were out . I had the feeling that they were leaving me alone until I got my bearings . It was a bright fall day , the kind of day , along with some days in winter , that New York is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk my familiar , and yet unfamiliar streets . I did not want to think about last night , and Martha , because I knew I did n't understand it yet : and I really did n't know , any longer , how I felt about Sidney . I did n't want to be unfair , and so I kept my mind a blank . Sidney was standing by the subway station , wearing an old red sweater and old black pants and a cap : and the conk was leaving his hair . We smiled at each other warily . We knew , after all , where we 'd been . We did n't know where we were . He affected a West Indian accent : " Buy you a cup of coffee , mate ? " I laughed . " I 'd rather have a beer . " " You show signs , very definite , of being incorrigible  --  but , as it 's you  --  come on . " We turned our back on the subway and the park , and walked about a block to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a bar mainly for whores and their men , and I did n't mind that so much  --  though this meant that I really had no business there  --  but I did n't like the cops or the other white men who came in there . Now , in the late afternoon , it was half empty  --  perhaps half a dozen young men , some scarcely more than boys , sittingor standing at the bar . A couple of older men were at the tables , discussing the numbers . Sidney and I sat at the bar . The barman , who was white , greeted Sidney as though he knew him . I did n't like his face . He was young , probably the son of the owner , one of those hip white boys who know that they know niggers , know them so well that they can imitate the nigger 's Ian/guage , and this gives them the right to treat niggers like scum . He served Sidney a Coke , he served me a beer . I lit a cigarette and offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney refused . " You do n't smoke anymore ? " " Not for the moment . Time will tell . " I took a swallow of my beer , and jumped in . " Congratulations about you and Martha , " I said , and I offered him my hand . He grinned , and we shook hands , and I felt better . " I  --  we  --  owe it all to you , " he said . " That 's a nice thing for you to say , and I appreciate it . But I did n't really have anything to do with it . After all "  --  I laughed , hoping I was n't saying the wrong thing  --  " I was n't here . " " How was it over there ? " " Man , you know how it was over there . It was bullshit piled high , pressed down , and running over . " I sipped my beer . " And lots of spattering blood and guts and brains and whores we treated like shit and V.D. and dysentery and dope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . Look around you , now that you back , and tell me how different is it over here . " I was silent . I looked around me . Past the profile of the boy at the far end of the bar , I looked through the open door , into the street . The sun was traveling westward , that is to say the earth was turning ; the sun struck the tops of buildings with a melancholy , departing glare and seemed to shake the topmost windows . I could see , from where I stood , the merciless metal fire escape running down the side of one building , and the entrance to the building , recessedfrom the street . Some children were playing an impenetrablegame , involving both the fire-escape ladder and a ball , in this alley , and on the sidewalk . A bus , filled with black people , moved past slowly , cutting off my view : now I saw only the silhouettes of black people behind the bus windows  --  just past the profile of the boy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed to have been struck still , and dumb . The bus moved on . A very sharp hustler , in a sharp white hat , stood at the curb , with two others , less sharp . Three girls walked by , they seemed to be schoolgirls , and the men on the curb watched them . A black woman with a shopping bag walked slowly by , and a patrol car stopped in front of the place . The one in the white hat walked over to the patrol car and stood listening for a moment . Then the patrol car drove off . The boy at the end of the bar still had not moved . His forehead sloped back into a tangle of black hair which had not been combed in days , his nose was long , aquiline , his lips were parted , his eyes were black with wonder . His long hands , on the bar , were absolutely still . I looked back at Sidney , but found nothing to say . " They have us trapped here , " said Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Everything belongs to them . " He gestured toward the bartender , and said , in a low voice , out of the side of his mouth  --  something I had never known him to do before  --  " That devil , and his papa , they own I do n't know how many blocks , how much real estate around here , and , between them and the cops , man , and be you a whore or be you a chump looking for a license , you do n't turn no tricks , you hear me , if you do n't bend over and spread them cheeks . And you better be smiling , and holler thank you ! " He finished his Coke . " They got our nuts in a vise , man , and all we can do is holler . " I could say nothing . I listened to his voice , and I watched his face  --  or , really , I could almost say that I listened to his face and watched his voice . I was beginning to hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very troubling way . It was as though one of my senses , or possibilities  --  sight , for example , or motion  --  had just been denied me , had just been stricken from me , and what remained to me had to do double or triple duty . " You want another Coke ? " I asked . " No , get me a beer . It 's all the same poison . " " Truer words were never spoken , " said the friendly bar/man , the hip white motherfucker , one of those barmen always in earshot . You hope somebody will strangle him one day , and you hope it wo n't be you . I watched Sidney 's voice because there was a river rolling in it , a deep river , long dammed , about to overthrow everything in the path of the river , including the barman who , now , with a brotherly , conspiratorial wink , placed our beers before us . I heard Sidney 's eyes as they thundered behind the barman the entire length of the bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank heaven , and my normal senses were returned to me , not quite , however , as they had been . Then , " Martha told you , " Sidney asked , " about my brother ? " I nodded yes . " He killed a man . I do n't blame him . I would have , too . " He sipped his beer , and said nothing more , and I said nothing . " I wondered , for a long time , how what happened to my brother could have happened . And now I think I know . " He looked beyond me , into the street . " I used to think he was in prison , and I had to get him out . Now I know we all in prison , and we got to get us out . " I watched him , and I listened . " They told us God was white , and cut our nuts off , raped our women , slaughtered our children , and got us penned up here , like hogs . And they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will  --  their God . " He took a deep swallow of his beer , very calm now . " It 's God 's will because they own everything  --  and they stole everything they own . Their whole history is a lie  --  ai n't a white devil walking who can tell the truth , not one . They even stole God . " I thought to myself , Good . They can have Him . But I said nothing . Something was going on , deep inside me , somethingmoving  --  too deep , too slow , too fast for me to grasp.  |p343Something  was tormenting me , like the beginning of music , like the void into which one drops to find the word . Sidney was trying to give me something , or to share something . Whatever it was , I could not possibly give it to Arthur . That may sound strange  --  and , even now , it sounds strange to me  --  but that 's what I was thinking , if I was thinking at all . Gods who could be stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't raised to deal in stolen goods . As far as I was concerned , it was all a lie , from top to bottom : and , since we had built it , only we could dare it down . That energy called divine is really human need , translated , and if that God we have created needs patiencewith us , how much more than patience do we need with God ! Sidney and I walked our streets together until he had to go to work , and I left him at the door of Jordan 's Cat . And I knew that I would never see him again , not as I had . The only person in my life , then , really , was my brother , Arthur  --  and I accepted this with no complaint , even withoutastonishment  --  and time was flying and I had to start working on the building . I did not want to find Arthur standing , one day , in profile to me , at the far end of the bar . Yes . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and time began to do its number . I woke up one morning in San Francisco , and I knew that there was something strange about the day , but I could n't place what it was . Then I said to myself , with a reluctant wonder , I 'm thirty . I 'm thirty years old today . I was alone in my hotel room . I had been on the coast for a couple of months , working with the California branch of the advertising agency I worked for in New York . It was a white firm , as need scarcely be said , but , in the sixties , as my countrymen were proud to point out , we blacks were making great strides in fields previously blocked to us . Thirty . Well . I still had to get out of bed and confront andp344wash this aging frame . Which did n't feel too decrepit , just the same . In fact , I felt pretty good , and I was even rather pleased that the day found me alone . And I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , or any shit like that . No , I was simply pleased and a little astonished to find myself still among the living , to have lasted this long . And it was a nice day , and I like San Francisco . I wondered if I could find anyone to have lunch with me . It was a Saturday , so there 'd be no one at the office , but I had a couple of numbers in my book . I got in and out of the shower , got dressed , called room service for coffee . I looked out of my window , seeing , mainly , the tops of tall buildings , but I knew that beneath , below these , were my steeply vertiginous , beloved streets . The girl came with the coffee and , at the very same moment , the phone rang . The girl was Oriental , and she left . The phone call , as it turned out , was Faulkner . Faulkner was blood-related to my boss , precisely to what legal degree I never knew : blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loathed him , but I must confess that he frightened me , too  --  he was only about twenty , and had the moral sense of a crocodile . " Hall ? " That voice , clipped and rushed , remnant of Hollywoodfilms with a British setting , and various private schools . " Yes ? Speaking . " " Something came up , we need you back here . " " Why are you calling me ? " " What do you mean , why am I calling you ? Listen , I 'm Faulkner Grey , I 'm part of this firm  --  " " I know who you are , and I know you 're part of the firm , but you 're not my boss . I do n't take orders from you . " " Listen , this was just a friendly call to let you know that you 're going to be needed on deck back here , why are you jumping down my throat ? " " Because you might be high on something . Because youp345and I do n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a Saturday afternoon  --  " " And because you hate my guts , right ? " " I do n't think about you one way or the other , Faulkner . I just do n't know how to move on your word . " But I rather regretted , just the same , the tone I 'd taken . It was n't smart . " Do you think I 'm calling you because I love your big brown eyes ? Do you think I miss you , for Christ 's sake ? " Could be , I thought , could be . The thought had crossed my mind more than once . The kid damn sure stayed on my case . And I knew I was n't being smart , but I could n't help it : " I certainly miss you , darling . What 's up ? " " You know , for an intelligent black cat and all , you can be pretty sickening . " " Hush , child . Jealous tantrums will get you nowhere . Is my presence urgently required ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane today , so you could be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed early Monday morn-ing . " " On the level ? You 're not shitting me ? " " No , I 'm not shitting you , you bastard , " and he hung up . Junior . You are God 's masterpiece , the matchless creep of creeps , and I will never know what I could possibly have done , in any of my previous lives , to deserve you . Still , he was n't certifiably insane ; if I was a little afraid of him , he was , also , a little afraid of me , and this meant that my presence was required back in New York . Having Faulkner call me was just one more of the little ways they had of letting me know that I might be an intelligent black cat and all , and my people might be making great strides in the kingdom , but I was still a nigger . And , fuck it , yes , I am , and I was n't going to let these people spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way at all . White people can steal a lot of your time , can steal your whole life , if you let them . So I figured I would spend the day in San Francisco , andp346take a flight out in the evening . Time works for you as you head east , and so I thought I might see my parents before my birthday was completely over . I decided to call them , to give them this news . I did n't know where Arthur was , had n't seen him in three months . Neither of us lived at home anymore , and Arthur was workingall the time . He had still to make , as we say , the " big one , " but he got better all the time ; he had a faithful , growingaudience , mostly black but not entirely ; he was n't making a lot of money but he was n't starving , either , and he was only , after all , twenty-three . I was proud of him . And we got on well . We loved each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We liked each other , and that was nice . My mother answered the phone . " Honey , I was just thinking about you . How you faring out there , with all them cowboys and Indians ? Do n't get scalped now , " and she laughed . " Oh , and happy birthday . " " I 'm thirty years old today . " " I know you made thirty , child , I was there . Lord , it seems like a dream . " " You proud of me , Mama ? " Have I been a good son ? But I did n't ask that . " I 've always been proud of you . Hush . Your daddy wants to say something to you . " My father got on the phone . " Happy birthday , son  --  Hall , I was thinking , now that you beginning to grow up and all , that it 's my duty as a fatherto take you aside and give you a little instruction "  --  here , he coughed elaborately  --  " about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a father 's duty  --  " " The birds and the bees ? Aw , shucks , Dad , birds fly and bees sting  --  is that what you want to tell me ? " " Look like somebody got there ahead of me , " he said , and we laughed together . " Ca n't say I did n't try . When you think you coming this way ? " " Well  --  that 's why I called , really . I 'll be coming in sometimetonight . " I coughed . " The Board of Directors requires my presence . "  | " On a Saturday ? You must be a big man on the board . " " Daddy , I know I do n't know much about the birds and the bees and such , but how do you spell that ? It must be we got a bad connection . " " You got a dirty mind . I 'm going to have your mama wash it out with soap . I said board , Hall , now pull yourself together . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there Monday morning , but I thought I 'd come in tonight . " " That 'd be mighty nice . Around what time ? " " I do n't know yet : Nine , ten , along around that time . I 'll call you back , and let you know as soon as I get a flight . " " Well . We 'll be here . You know your mama , she going to bake you a cake . You got anybody special you want to see ? " " No . You did n't tell me about the birds and the bees soon enough . " " I knew you was fixing to blame me for something . I did n't tell you to go out there , in all that Indian territory . You ai n't fit to see nobody . " " I 'd like to see my brother , if he 's around . " " Man , Arthur is in Canada . Tell me he 's shaking them up , up there . " " In Canada ? Where in Canada ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard my mother 's voice in the background . " Your mother say , he 's in Toronto now , but he 's been in Quebec , and everywhere . " " I guess I wo n't see him , then . " " You 'll see him when he gets here . You going to be here for a while , ai n't you ? " " Yeah . That 's true . Well  --  I 'll call you back later , Daddy . Let me go , and take care of business . " " Go with God . We love you . " " I love you , too . Good-bye . " " See you later , son . " And we hung up . I finished my coffee , and descended into the city . It was the end of spring , you could almost taste the smoke of the coming summer . The streets were crowded with peo/ple who seemed to be hurrying toward the summer  --  I thought of Irwin Shaw 's " The Girls in Their Summer Dresses . " Their bright summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street  --  I was on the heights of San Francisco  --  and looked both ways , up and down . There was a cable-car line on the street on which I was standing and a part of me wanted to ride it , just for fun , but another part of me wanted to walk . The street before me simply dropped , dropped as steep , it seemed to me , as a mountain slope , and it ended , I knew , at the wharf . I started down this street , as happy as a kid on a holiday . For a moment , I had nothing to do and nowhere to be . I also had no one to eat with but this did n't really bother me , either : and I could n't do anything about it , because I had left my phone book in the hotel , and I was n't going back for it . Thirty . And I had a lobster , all by myself , looking out over the vast , gray crashing water , watching the sun on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , had been for a while , and might be for a while , but it no longer frightened me the way it had . I was discovering something terrifyingly simple : there was absolutely nothing I could do about it . I was discovering this in the way , I suppose , that everybody does , but having tried , endlessly , to do something about it . You attach yourself to someone , or you allow someone to attach themselves to you . This person is not for you , and you , really , are , not for that person  --  and that 's it , son . But you try , you both try . The only result of all your trying is to make absolutely real the unconquerable distance between you : to dramatize , in a million ways , the absolutely unalterable truth of this distance . Side by side , and hand in hand , your sunsets , nevertheless , are not occurring in the same universe . It is not merely that the rain falls differently on each of you , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that what is rain for the one is not rain for the other . Your elements will not mix ,  |p349unless  one agrees that the elements be pulverized  --  and the result of that is worse than being alone . The result of that is to become one of the living dead . The most dreadful people I have ever known are those who have been " saved , " as they claim , by Christ  --  they could not possibly be more deluded  --  thosefor whom the heavenly telephone is endlessly ringing , always with disastrous messages for everybody else . Or those people who have been cured by their psychiatrists , a cure which has rendered them a little less exciting than oatmeal . I prefer sinners and madmen , who can learn , who can change , who can teach  --  or people like myself , if I may say so , who are not afraid to eat a lobster alone as they take on their shoulders the monumental weight of thirty years . Then I walked to the airline office , through my favorite American streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I said : " Make that first class , if you please . " No one , as far as I know , has ever tried to describe airportsand air travel . First of all , I am certainly not the only person in the world who , at the very center of his being , is simply numb with terror at the idea of flying at all . I am not grateful for the pilot 's announcement that we are now thirty-three thousand feet in the air . I do not want to know that ; it is perfectly useless information . I already know that it 's a long way down , that this fall will be the mortal fall . I do n't think about it , and I do n't think I appear to be frightened , and I am not frightened , consciously . I ca n't afford to be frightenedconsciously . And , of course , I know that automobiles are yet more lethal , that not everyone who steps off the curb manages to get across the street , that the bathtub or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and drink too much . Whatever is going to kill me is already moving , is on the road , and I do not know , no more than anyone does , how I will face that last intensity , when everything flames up for the last time and then the flame falters and goes out.
