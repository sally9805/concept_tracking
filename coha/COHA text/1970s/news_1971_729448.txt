txt The World Common Market : Two Men Who Were Convinced It Was ' Possible PARIS -- It some future historit ; an of 20th-century Europe wants a single event to serve as a symbolic turning-point , he could well choose the scene in  --  the Elysee Palace last Friday evening . In the Salle des Fetes , a great room hung with Gobelin tapestries , sat perhaps 200 journalists and diplainats . The President of France and the Prime Minister of Britain were together at the small table facing them . Mr. Pompidou spoke first , slowly and with emphasis . After 15 minutes he came to his concluding passage . " Many people thought ' that Britain was not and did not want to become European , " he said , " and , only wanted to join the community to destroy it or , divert it from its aims . Many people also thought that France was prepared to use every pretext to impose another veto on British entry . " Eh . bien , mesdames et messieurs , you see before you two men convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the occasion , to mark a decisive break with the policy of his Olympian predecessor . For it was in that very room , on the grounds now disclaimed by Mr. Pompidou , that Charles de Gaulle had said " non " to Britain 's entry into the European Economic Community . The little drama In the Elysee made it clear that the long ' estrangement between Britain , and the Continent was over . In 12 hours together during  --  a two-day summit meeting , the Prinie Minister and the President had opened the way for enlargement of the Common ? Market to include Britain and the other applicant states , Ireland , Denmark and Norway . The meeting dealt with politics in both the grand sense and the particulars . For Mr. Pompidou , it was necessary to test Mr. Heath 's general outlook . Was he a true European in the Gallic meaning of that phrase -- -one willing to ' put Europe ahead of the old relationship with the United States ? Lifetime Belief No one who knows Mr. Heath at all could doubt his dedication to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told the crowd in the Elysee , those are his beliefs of a lifetime . But Mr. Pompidou , governing France in a Gaullist political context , needed to be personally and publicly reassured . And he was : in the language of their joint Communique expressing a commitment to " distinctively European policies . " The particular assurance , Mr. Pompidou wanted was on sterling a Pledge that Britain would phase out sterling 's role as a reserve currency in order to take part in a European monetary union . Mr. Heath explained gladly , and it appears convincingly , that Britain had no attachment any more to the old world role of sterling . For Mr. Heath , the requirement of the meeting was an understanding that Britain could obtain terms for entry acceptable to the House of Commons . That meant , especially , consideratidp for New Zealand dairy farmers and for Commonwealth sugar growers , and acceptance of a gentle transition period for Britain herself , to cushion the financial burden of her contributions to the community budget : The ' communique 's most vital passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President and the Prime Minister thought it . " desirable and possible " for the negotiations on British entry to reach a successful conclusion soon . Both men orally made it more specific ; in June . The negotiators return to work , In Luxembourg on June 7 . They have one other session sched -- uled , later in the month . Of course there may be difficulties . But after last week all concerned now have confidence in success . The next step on the long political road will be ratification by Parliament , and here again determination will be required . To put it mildly , the British public is not yearning for Europe . On the day the summit ended so happily , a Gallup Poll was published showing that a majority of 59 to 23 per , cent in Britain disapproved of the application to join the community . But opinion polls do not govt. ern Britain . The Government does , subject to support in. the House of Commons . So the real question is whether enough members of Mr. Heath 's Conservative majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made up by Labor supporters of entry  --  to defeat him . On the Conservative side there are ? perhaps 40 men deeply opposed to the whole venture , notably former Health Minister Enoch Powell . But how many will actually go Into the opposition lobby if they know the result will be not only to deny ratification of this treaty but to bring down a Conservative government ? , The best guess is not enoughr The Labor party is sharply divided ; 127 Labor members of the House have signed a statement against entry , 100 atstatement favor , Sitting on the fence N the party 's leader , Harold Wilson . Mr. , Wilson is on record as a zealous convert to the European idea . But he wants rather more to be Prime Minister again ; ? In the present state of public opinion , ? opposition to entry ? might ? look like winning politics . Thus the prevailing belief of observers is that he will say he is still for Europe  --  but not on the bad terms incompetently negotiated by the Tories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratification . That scenario may underestimate Mr. , Wilson 's sense of history . But if it does work out that way , it may do no more than make some people " quietly sick , " as David Watt of , The Financial Times put it . For 40 or 50 Labor party Europeans , headed by the party 's deputy leader , Roy Jenkins , would  --  probably still go into the lobby , with Mr .. Heath . That would produce a healthy majority for him . A preliminary vote is likely to take place In the House of Commons in July , with formal ratification following toward the end of the year . Britain would become a member of the community on Jan. 1 , 1973 . Probably only then would Europe , and the world , begin to weigh ' the momentous consequences for many power relationships ' that will follow if the enlarged market develops toward political unity . The determination of Edward ? Heath is the key factor this , the ; element that.manyhave underestimated all along , Seeing his face in the Elysde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the resolute satisfaction of a man who had known all along that it must come out this way . .. - A1,4 " 1-140I , F1 , LEWIS
