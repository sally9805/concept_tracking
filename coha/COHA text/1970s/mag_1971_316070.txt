It seems at first far too facile and fragile an idea for a full-length movie : the roller derby as a metaphor for America 's competition , violence , degradation . Scenes of derby competition worked well in films like Petulia and Medium Cool because they were used as secondary symbols , episodes that were part of a more complex whole . But an entire feature devoted to the derby , its stars and its lifestyles ? Director-Cameraman Robert Kaylor confounds all expectations in Derby . He does it by treating the competition not as a symbol but as a sorry fact of life . <P> His film is about one real skater who has made it big ( Charlie O'Connell . captain of the San Francisco Bay Bombers ) , and another who wants desperately to follow him around the same successful turn . Mike Snell works in the Firestone Tire plant in Dayton , Ohio , and dreams of making it in big-time derby competition . Kaylor intercuts footage of O'Connell and Snell : the derby hero bashing his rivals , leading his team , conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hero Worshiper Snell going through the day-today hassles of making a tentative kind of life for himself and his family . Kaylor captures scenes and feelings-fac-tores , roadhouses , dancehalls , motorcycles-that make similar attempts in Joe look like musty melodrama . <P> Kaylor uses a kind of modified neorealist technique in which real people re-enact real situations . The results are often stunning . There is a pervasive tone of desperation in Derby , a sense of ironic , backhanded success about O'Connell and a pitiful aimlessness in Snell . As the documentary ends , he gets on a motorcycle and rides out to roller derby school in San Francisco . Snell says he wants to " better " himself , but Derby has made it clear that success will mean no more than living a hollow dream . Jay Cocks
