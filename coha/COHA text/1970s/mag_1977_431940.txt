 | It happened a long , long , time ago , but I remember it as if it were only yesterday ? because it turned out to be the merriest Christmas my brothers and I ever had . The very word Christmas has a magical power that makes me want to laugh , shout with joy and cry all at the same time . At Christmas I am young again . Life is suddenly filled with infinite surprise and wonder . It is filled , as it must have been 2,000 years ago , with the promise of human possibility , to be unwrapped like a gift that each year is new yet familiar . Most of all , the word Christmas transports me , from anywhere on earth , back to Wisconsin , to that isolated farm we called Seldom Seen . The many Christmases of my childhood spent there have merged now into one rich memory . A few Christmases there stand out in my memory : The year there was n't any snow ; the year we did n't have a Christmas tree ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked over the tree ? and one other . I was very young that special year and Christmas was still more  | things than spirit to me . The remembered feelings , happenings , smells and colors of that year became to me " the year the presents did n't come . " The first promise of that Christmas came on a day when the dry , brown grass of late summer crackled under our bare feet as we raced to meet the mailman and were handed the first of the fall-winter mail-order catalogs . George Holliday smiled and said , as he did each time he delivered a catalog , " Here 's the , new want book ' boys . Merry Christmas . " As each " book " arrived the four of us would sprawl on the lawn under the big maple tree , grabbing , fighting , arguing over which page we would look at first . Laurance , the eldest , wanted to see the rifles . Junior wanted to look at the guitars and auto parts . Lee demanded to see the saddles . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all those things when 1 could be looking at the toys . When it was time for us to go back to work in the hayfields , we 'd start fighting about who had dibs on the newest catalog for the evening . The catalogs , it must be understood , were our department stores . They came , visitors from a marvelous place somewhere outside our iso- lated world , and told us Christmas was coming and that a selected few of all the wonderful things on display would be ours . Because we memorized in minute detail every item ( except the useful things ) , there was no way for Christmas presents to be a complete surprise . if a thing existed , it was in the catalogs and we had seen it . So one year Father and Mother gave up trying to surprise us with just the right gift . At a time before I can remember , it was decided that we would pick our own presents from the catalogs . We each were allowed to spend a certain sum of money . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Father and Mother to make our agonizing final choices . " If you get the blue truck , what else do you want ? You still have thirty-one cents , " Mother would ask . " This top maybe , " I 'd answer , pointing to a whistling top with bright-colored stars that turned into stripes when it spins . " That top 's more than thirty-one cents . Would n't this top do ? " " No . No . No . The colors are different . Maybe I 'll get the car with red wheels , instead . " This one ? " " No . No . No . Red wheels with white sidewalls and a crank sticking out in front . " Mother would sigh and fill in my choices on the order blank . She liked to preserve the rituals of special days and was uneasy with all the picking and choosing and counting up of money . " Does n't it spoil it for you ? " she 'd say . We 'd tell her no , but still we knew it bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on schedule and our choices began to grow in our minds into incredible shapes and sizes , becoming our own creations , so secure that even the Christmas morning confrontation with reality could not change them back into ordinary things again . Every morning after that when I woke up , I would stay under the covers a moment , shut my eyes tight and try to imagine what was happening to our order . After five days I decided the letter had arrived at the warehouse in Chicago . Two more days , no make it three because they were busy , to find our things and ship them . Another five days for the package to come . I added one more day to my imaginary schedule because I wanted the package to arrive on Saturday when I could run to meet the mailman myself . On Saturday I was there , as planned , to meet Mr. Holliday . He was driving a sled by then because his Model-T Ford could n't make it through all the snow . He poked through the packages in the sled box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here yet . " He listened carefully when I told him the schedule I had allowed . " I figure another six days , " he said . " Make it seven , " I said . " Why ? " " It 'll be Saturday again . " " Seven days it is , " he said . " Since that 's important . " It was important all right . If I could get the package myself and walk slowly to the house , I could squeeze a little to identify things . At the one-room school down in Halls Branch Valley , Teacher asked one day , as she always did the last week before vacation , " What do you want for Christmas this year ? " We recited our hopes and choices ? dolls , sleds , teddy bears , skis , ball gloves , BB guns . From one boy always a request for a pet skunk . And of course , a big blue truck and car with red wheels and whitewall tires . Just talking about the things made them seem more real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next Saturday came . I ran halfway out to Denny Meagher 's woods to meet the mailman . He leaned down and handed me the mail ? nothing but letters . " No packages for you today . Guess we need to give it till next week . " And so we waited . T he days moved closer to Christmas and still the package did not come . School was out and each forenoon we waited in the cold for Mr. Holliday . He would search for the package he knew was not there and say " Maybe tomorrow . " We 'd run to tell Father and Mother , watching their faces for clues of what they were going to do about it . They did n't ask us to choose substitute presents . There were no last-minute shopping trips to the neighboring country stores . The four of us would go outside again and talk about it . Maybe there was n't enough money to buy things at the stores after writing the check to the mail-order company , we speculated . Maybe they had other reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailbox with a half gallon can of steaming coffee for Mr. Holliday . " You know , " he said , not looking at us , " I guess it did n't come , but I 'll look once more . " His voice was gruff with emotion . He sorted through the packages . We knew it was n't there . He was just trying to make us feel better . Or maybe make himself feel better . He turned around to us and rubbed his mitten across his chin . " I 'm sorry . I hear tell there 's been a train wreck down toward Chicago . Lot of things not coming through . Tell you what , I 'll call if anything comes on the afternoon train . " He took the coffee and drove on . We stood kicking at the snow to keep our feet warm and we talked about the train wreck . I could see in my mind , our presents scattered in the snow . I was crying when we went to the house . Mother held me . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our presents ? " Something changed in her face . " There 's more to Christmas than presents , " she said quietly . The day turned colder in midafternoon . Snow began to fall . The time for the afternoon train passed and there was no phone call . Mother had to remind us to get the tree . That meant choosing several boughs from one of the big white pines in the yard and lashing them together to look like a real smaller tree . The four of us did that with none of our usual arguing . When we carried the tree in and set it up in the dining room , the snow began to melt into hundreds of shiny beads of water . " Look ! " Mother said , " It 's already decorated . " We popped corn and made strings , the white corn alternated with red cranberries . We got out the folded paper ornaments that magically became bright colored stars , bells and balls when they were unfolded . Mother began to hum a Christmas carol . The cat played with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then came sneaking back to pounce and he chased away again . It was all just like any other year , but halfway through I sat down behind the heating stove and just watched . The house was very still when I woke on Christmas morning . Tree-like patterns of frost covered the lower half of my window . The snow had stopped falling . Far out across a white meadow , I could see smoke rising from the chimney of a neighbor 's house , reminding me that other people were having Christmas . I heard Father get up and rekindle the fires . The smell of wood smoke filled the house . The dining room was warm when I went down for breakfast , candle flames flickering on the tree and Father standing by with a bucket of water " just in case . " Mother had put a great bunch of bittersweet in the middle of the table , the yellow hulls split open . showing the bright red berries . For each of us there was a basket filled with English walnuts , pecans. almonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright naval orange and a big red apple . Already my brothers were making deals about sharing halves of apples and oranges which were too special to he eaten all at once . I sorted though my basket , still silenced by the strangeness of a morning with no presents to open . My new toys had always captured me , pulling me off into a world that did not include other persons . After the morning chores were done , we gathered again in the warm dining room and Father and Mother took turns reading aloud the Christmas letters that had come from friends and relatives far away . One letter , in an envelope lined with bright colored paper , was from  | Father 's mother , the grandmother I had never seen . Father read slowly , translating the Norwegian words into his careful English . One of my brothers asked Father a question about his mother and he got out old pictures of her for us to see . When the letters were finished and the arguing about who got which stamps was over , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . We made sugar cookies , eating them hot and buttery right from the oven almost as fast as we cut out new ones . The chickens were already cooking , filling the house with a rich roasting smell . Junior brought his guitar into the kitchen and we sang as we worked . Not Christmas carols ; they were for later . Everyone kept talking about other Christmases , every other sentence beginning with " Remember the time .... " Mother helped me into the cellar , down through the trap door in the pantry floor , and handed me a lighted kerosene lantern . I picked out especially good potatoes from the big bin , dug carrots out of the boxes of sand , chose a Hubbard squash , found jars of pickled crabapples and fished slippery dill pickles out of the ten-gallon crock . Everybody seemed busy every minute . There were nuts to crack , pies to bake ; coffee to grind , cream to whip . We carried live coals from the dining room and started up the living-room stove so it would be warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding the kitchen stove to keep the fire just right . Finally , we all helped carry the steaming dishes to the dining-room table with its white tablecloth that was trimmed with lace . There was a solemn moment and then the food itself , delicious and unending . After dinner we went outside to help Father put up a sheaf of oats for the birds and he told us again how he had always done that in Norway , though there it had been wheat . We stepped back and waited , standing very still . A bluejay swooped in and peered at the oats , head cocked to one side . A bright red cardinal came and began to eat . Then a whole flock of English sparrows arrived , noisy and quarrelsome , reminding me of my three brothers and me . The shadows were already long when we came back inside and went to the living room where Mother played the piano for carol singing . I stood close beside her , singing with the rest . Between songs , Mother smiled at me , gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even then I do n't think I realized just how much the meaning of Christmas Day had changed for me . Maybe that is the way of Christmas stories . Their meanings have to grow with the seasons and the telling . A year later , Teacher asked , as always , what we wanted for Christmas . One by one the answers came ? a doll , a BB gun , a sled , a pet skunk . Then it was my turn . I knew what I had asked for ? a bright-red fire engine . I almost said that . Teacher waited , then smiled and said , " Not sure yet ? " I nodded and let it go at that , unwilling to speak with all those faces watching , not quite sure how to say , " I just want it to be Christmas . "
