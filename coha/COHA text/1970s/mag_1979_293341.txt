White ; Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; <P> 362 pages ; $12.95 <P> She was a founding mother of The New Yorker . She was also a gardener , a fiercely dedicated grubber of New England soil , an avid and acerbic consumer of seed catalogues . She had readjust about everything written about greenery and had strong opinions on every specimen from azalea to zinnia . So strong that Katharine S. White managed to sow in the least rustic of magazines a classic series of green thoughts : on herbs and weeds , trees and seeds , pedigreed blooms and wildflowers . Her articles were written with elegance and precision , and they deserve a place with such horticultural classics as Charles Sprague Sargent 's Manual of the Trees of North America and John Parkinson 's A Garden of Pleasant Flowers , published in 1629 and still in print . <P> Katharine White , who died in 1977 , was the wife of The New Yorker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pieces , written between 1958 and 1970 , and garlanded Onward and Upward in the Garden with a graceful introduction . <P> Fortunately for E.B. and the reader , Katharine White was not obsessed with petal detail .

Like all serious gardeners , she was no April-to-September hobbyist . Her first magazine piece was written in February , the " season of lists and callow hopefulness " when hundreds of thousands of true gardeners are reading their catalogues and " dreaming their dreams . " This month she would have been planning her spring bulb garden , ordering indoor plants for the winter and putting down fertilizer for the snows to drive into the soil .
