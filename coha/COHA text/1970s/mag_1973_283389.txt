ONCE upon a very recent time , only a banana republic would devalue its money twice within 14 months . But last week , when the U.S. did just that by cutting the value of the once almighty dollar another 10% , the step proved to be both internationally popular and politically easy . In contrast with the four months of testy negotiations that were required to swing the 1971 devaluation , only five days of whirlwind conferences were needed to bring about last week 's large and surprising reduction-which made a total slash of 17.9% since December 1971 . Foreign moneymen agreed with the U.S. view that cutting the dollar once more was the best way to end what had become a new and virulent world monetary crisis . When the deed had been accomplished , Treasury Secretary George Shultz proclaimed it almost with pride , saying : " There can be no doubt we have achieved a major improvement in the competitive position of American business . " <P> The matter is infinitely more complex , of course , and devaluation will have many momentous effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should create jobs in businesses that produce goods for export , by making their products cheaper for foreigners to buy . But devaluation will also aggravate American inflation-how badly no one can yet tell-by pushing up the prices of imports . In addition , American travelers will have to spend more on foreign trips ; for example , the price of a single room in Tokyo 's Hotel Okura last week was $27.75 , v. $24 the week before and $22 in late 1971 . <P> By itself , last week 's devaluation will not end the persistent tendency of Americans to spend abroad more than they earn . After the 1971 cheapening of the dollar , the U.S. trade deficit more than doubled , to $6.8 billion last year , because devaluation did not lift exports as much as had been expected and the nation 's surging economy attracted more and costlier imports . To prevent a repeat , the U.S. is demanding that Japan and the European Common Market nations buy more and sell less in America . President Nixon is making protectionist mercantilist threats about what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual devaluation of the dollar has hastened the creation of a turbulent new world of money in which the once rigidly fixed values of some currencies are bouncing up and down like acrobats on a trampoline . Since late 1971 , for instance , the British pound has risen from $2.49 to $2.64 , sunk to an all-time low of $2.32 , and last week closed at $2.44 . Five important currencies - the pound , Japanese yen , Canadian dollar , Swiss franc and Italian lira-are " floating " with no fixed exchange rate at all . They sell at prices set mostly by supply and demand . That arrangement creates new uncertainty for importers , exporters , investors and tourists , who never know exactly how many dollars will be needed to buy any of these currencies tomorrow . <P> For all the problems and confusion surrounding it , the second dollar devaluation seems to have been inevitable . The credit for recognizing that fact and meeting it head-on belongs largely to George Pratt Shultz , the mild-mannered but steely-minded professor ( see box next page ) who plays as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon Administration as Henry Kissinger does in its diplomatic policy .
