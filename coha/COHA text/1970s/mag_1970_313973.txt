THE ordinary corporate prospectus , a document prepared for prospective investors in a new stock issue , is perhaps 25% livelier reading than the Manhattan telephone book . One recent prospectus , however , is on the way to becoming a Wall Street bestseller , mostly because it convulses readers with often grim laughter . Brokers and other businessmen have been discussing it in board rooms and over luncheon tables ; investment firms have ordered extra copies in quantity . <P> The author , Burton R. Tauber , 35 , took time out last spring from his Wall Street law practice-which often involved preparation of prospectuses-to do some volunteer antiwar lobbying in Washington . He felt that he got nowhere . In order to relieve his frustration , he began dictating a prospectus for " The War in Viet Nam " ( " hereinafter referred to as ' the Company ' " ) . He got about one-third of the way through before his secretary realized that it was a parody . No wonder ; Tauber has reproduced both the form and the stilted legalese of a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an ideal vehicle for deadpan satire . <P> Warning and Reassurance . The Company , the prospectus solemnly states , " commenced business as a small-scale consulting firm , but since 1964 has branched out into the active conduct of upholding democracy and honoring commitments . " At present , " the business of the Company consists primarily of acquiring and destroying real estate . " Richard Nixon has been Chief Executive Officer since Jan. 1 , 1969 ( " Prior thereto , Mr. Nixon devoted his life to securing his present position " ) , and Spiro T. Agnew has been Vice President since the same date ( " Prior to his joining the Company , Mr. Agnew did not exist " ) . The Company has organized a " Cambodian Subsidiary , " and maintains an office in Paris , France , " but does not consider such facilities or operations to be significant . " <P> " After deduction for miscalculation and wastage in the Pentagon and corruption and pilferage in Southeast Asia , " the prospectus says , the Company expects to raise a net of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds will go partly for " payments and benefits to certain government officers in Viet Nam and their mistresses . See ' Remuneration . ' " Prospective investors are duly warned that " this offering involves a high degree of risk . " However , they are reassured that " over the longer period , investors shall receive honor and retention of face . "
