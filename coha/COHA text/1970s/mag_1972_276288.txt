THE Phase 11 wage-price curbs have changed so much lately that the period now beginning might be called Phase 11 . The inflation-fighting program started six months ago as a sweeping attempt to put controls on companies of all sizes , down to side-street delicatessens and hand laundries , with only a small enforcement mechanism . Now the operation has been streamlined into something much closer to what most economists had recommended all along . The Nixon Administration will restrict controls to the major companies that set the pace for the economy , and back the controls by tougher policing and the threat of well-publicized punishment . <P> The biggest change came last week , when the Cost of Living Council exempted from controls some 5,000,000 companies that have 60 or fewer employees each ( small companies in the inflation-ridden fields of health care and construction are still controlled ) . COLC Director Donald Rumsfeld said : " It appears to us that competition will exert pay and price control on these small businesses . " <P> More Rollbacks . The small companies that were liberated account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some 900 Internal Revenue Service agents will be freed from the job of poring over the books of these firms and shifted to the more productive task of investigating complaints against larger corporations . In all , nearly 2,000 IRS men will be policing the big companies . As Herbert Stein , head of President Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers , put it : " We can watch many more billions of Gross National Product by watching General Motors than by watching the corner grocer . " <P> Simultaneously , the Price Commission continued to toughen its regulation of the companies with annual sales of $50 million or more that must report price and profit data . The commission ordered more rollbacks involving major companies , though relatively minor products . Textron Inc. , for example , must rescind a price increase on snowmobiles , and Armco Steel will have to cancel hikes on such merchandise as soap and hammers sold in its oilfield supply stores , which account for less than 1% of Armco 's sales . Both companies were also ordered to refund money to customers who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sales of $240 million a year , became the second company to be assessed triple damages for raising prices . The commission ordered it in effect to pay these damages to customers by severely cutting prices . <P> The commission also cracked down on the distressingly large number of companies that , it says , have been supplying it with suspicious-looking data or none at all . Under its complex rules , price boosts must not increase a company 's profit margin-its ratio of earnings to sales-above that of a pre-control base period . To enforce that rule , the commission had ordered that 2,954 companies file profit-margin reports by last week . Nearly 1,600 failed to do so . <P> Chairman C. Jackson Grayson ordered them to come up with the figures by this week or else roll back all price increases previously granted and face fines of $2,500 each .
