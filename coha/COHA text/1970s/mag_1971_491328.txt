CORNERED BY THE KING COBRA If I were living permanently in a house in a Burmese village , and if I had to choose just one animal for a pet , I would take the mongoose . This is a delightful little creature , grayish in color , weighing some three pounds , possessed of a bushy tail at one end and a sharp intelligent face with bright eyes at the other . Easily tamed , a mongoose will romp around a house like a frisky kitten or a pup , or ride on your shoulder as you putter about the yard . a few coins to the snake charmer . I 've seen only one real tight to the death be  --  tween a cobra and a mongoose . I was in an Assamese tea garden on a very hot day at about three in the afternoon , relaxing after a jungle patrol , when I noticed a quick movement in the bushes across the compound . A mongoose was hovering around the edge of the hushes , peering intently into them . He would start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant play of spasmodic motion . Now he would be crouched down on four legs ; now he would rise up on two legs . Always his sharp little eyes remained fixed on that spot in the bushes . A pattern of activity soon became obvious . The mongoose would run forward a little less each time , and he would pound , where the mongoose had some fighting room . Now began the classical battle of the mon  --  goose and the cobra . The animal worried the snake by pretending to attack , by feinting and dodging and scooting from one side to the other , within range when the snake was deciding to strike , out of range when it did strike . The cobra would lunge , miss , and hit the ground with a thump . The mongoose would dart in boldly , skip aside , circle around , and come in at a different angle . His agility made the difference . His move  --  ments were like lightning compared to those of the cobra . It was an extraordinary sight , this small animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake armed with sufficient venom to I have another reason for my choice . I hate snakes , and if you keep a mongoose , you do n't have snakes in the house . A mongoose specializes in challenging the most horrendous denizen of the jungle , the king cobra . And that 's enough for me . I 've often watched an Indian snake charmer putting on an act with a mongoose and a cobra , bringing the snake out of a basket and allowing the mongoose to have a go at it until it becomes tired enough to get hurt . Then the cobra goes back into the basket , while the spectators who have gathered around pet the mongoose and tossdraw back a little more , gradually moving into the open area of the compound on my side of the bushes . After him came a king cobra eight or nine feet long . The mongoose had maneuvered it out into the open . He had discovered the snake in the bushes , and by goading it , barely within reach , barely beyond reach , had tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rears about one-third of its length off the ground , its weight brings it a little forward after a lunge . Without realizing what was happening , the snake abandoned the security of the bushes , advancing into the corn-destroy him in a few seconds . I noticed that the cobra was becoming tired . It struck more slowly than when the battle be  --  gan . It had more difficulty rearing back into an upright position . Baffled , outwitted , it faced an antagonist that seemed to gain in stamina and determination . The snake struck for the last time . Before it could raise its head . the mongoose flashed into close quarters and seized it by the back of the neck in a death grip . The snake writhed as the sharp teeth crunched together at the base of the skull . When it lay still , the mon  --  goose dragged it back into the bushes for a meal . One evening I was hunting jungle fowl when dusk was falling and they were fluttering into the trees to roost . They made a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , guided by the sound , I went on until I saw a hen on the ground run around a bush . I followed as quietly as possible . What sounded like a hen call  --  ing gave me a lead . Moving onward , reaching the place where the sound was coming from , I heard a rustling on the ground , looked down , and saw a hamadryad making the sound . It sounded exactly like a jungle fowl . Whether it could have lured a bird close enough for a kill , I do n't know ? and 1 shot it without learning . The king cobra can also imitate the call of a pheasant . My worst cobra confrontation occurred when I was after a rogue elephant in the jungle along  --  side some tea estates in Assam , near the Himala  --  yas . One morning I heard the breaking of branches and the noise of an elephant feeding . so I went out with my rifle . This turned out to be the wrong elephant , and I left him alone . Disap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a tiger . Later I returned to the tea estate entrance intending to go to my room . Grass five or six inches high had overgrown the path , making visibility underfoot difficult . Carrying my rifle in my left hand , I walked down a slope , made a turn around a bend , and heard a rough rustling sound that seemed to sweep along the ground toward me . Startled , I swung around just in time to see a huge king cobra , at least twelve feet long , rear into a striking position . Probably it had been basking in the sun , started to retreat , and then felt I was about to step on its tail . Anyway , the snake changed its mind in a split second . Instead of slithering off , it swept back like a flash ? the rustling sound that drew my attention ? and assumed its attack stance be  --  fore I was aware of its presence . The hamadryad was close enough to hit me in the ribs if it decided to strike . Instinct told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III had start  --  ed to raise my rifle , I would have been bitten long before I could get it into position for a shot . If I attempted to run , the snake would have sunk its fangs into my back or my leg before I had taken a step . I would have died agonizingly , as do so many people in Southeast Asia who are bitten by the hamadryad every year . This horrible creature , its hood spread wide , swayed gently from side to side . I was afraid to blink and prayed I would n't lose my nerve and panic , as I looked into those chilling eyes . We stood there trying to stare each other down . To my unspeakable relief , the cobra gave in . It stop  --  ped swaying , lowered its head into the grass , and slithered away into the underbrush . As it went , I could hear the birds and squirrels scolding in each tree it passed . I reached my room in a cold sweat after one jungle experience I do n't care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation , we were living in bashas as usual . My hasha was of purely functional construction , without unnecessary ad  --  ditions . Instead of rising to the ceiling , the walls terminated some four feet off the floor , and they enclosed only three sides . The fourth side lay open . and from it a flight of three or four steps extended to the ground . The bed was on one side of the basha , in a corner . This arrangement gave me all the comfort I needed , keeping the rain out and allowing me to free myself from the mud by kicking off my boots when I entered . One day after lunch I was lying on the bed in the basha , snug and dry despite the deluge of rain splattering on the roof and pouring down the eaves . With our work well in hand . I could afford a break . Although my shotgun was leaning against the corner post at the head of the bed , ready in case I needed it , I did n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears except the patter of raindrops . The whole camp had re  --  laxed for an early-afternoon siesta . I was absorbed in a book , The Scarlet Pim  --  pernel , Baroness Orczy 's exciting historical novel about the English gentleman who rescued people from the guillotine during the French Revolu  --  tion Every now and then I 'd turn my eyes away from the book and look at the beautiful paddy fields down below with the paddy growing knee-high. looking like the top of a billiard table , smooth and green . After a glance , I would turn back to the novel , resuming the adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel . By degrees , a strange feeling crept over me , an irritation I could n't explain , a mental block that prevented me from concentrating . I tried to shake the mood off and read on . I put the book down ; I picked it up ; I repeated the same per  --  formance a moment later . Something was wrong . but I could n't put my finger on it . Suddenly another sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of gaining somebody 's attention by fixing your gaze on the back of his head . It may be in a church or in a bus , but if you stare at him with unswerving con  --  centration , the moment will come when he will turn around and look at you . I 've known this to happen when I tried it with my friends . That was the sensation that stirred me as I lay on the bed HUNTING Do animals have a sense of humor ? They certainly communicate their feelings in complex ways . Monkeys chattering peacefully in a group will suddenly scatter when one of them gives a particular kind of cry , for they understand he 's telling them to make for the higher branches because a leopard perhaps , or a python , is approaching with a simian entree in mind for the next meal . A barking deer will alert in the basha . I put my book down , turned my head to the wall of the basha beside me , and saw a huge snake draped over the low wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . It was star  --  ing over my shoulder as if it too had been follow  --  ing the story . I was terror-stricken . Somehow , with a burst of muscular energy that I did n't know I had . I hopped off the bed onto the floor , crawled along to the open end of the basha , and rolled down the steps to the ground outside . I yelled to my boys , " Come over here ! There 's a big snake in my basha ! " Naturally , the snake got just as much of a fright as I did . It slithered up from the wall into the thatch of the roof , trying to find some way of escape . As I saw it go , I crawled back into the basha . Stooping down and glancing up , I grabbed my shotgun and ran out . By then die snake was crawling along in the thatch , and the nearest members of the teak timber corps had arrived . I shouted to them , " Throw sticks and stones at it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Missiles bounced off the roof near the snake , which abandoned the thatch for an overhanging tree , perhaps the one that had given it an access route down into the basha . As it slid from one branch to another , I shot it in the head . The creature fell to the ground , twisted convulsively , and lay still . These encounters with snakes were among my most terrifying moments . Creatures like these arc enough to keep you on edge . In the dense jungle , I 'd rather face a man-eating tiger or a rampaging boar or a charging elephant . It 's easier to see the big game , easier to hit them ; and they do n't leave you feeling slightly nauseated . Quite the con  --  trary . I love the four-footed animals , however dangerous . I will never love a snake . EPISODES all of his kind within earshot about a pack of wild dogs on the prowl a harsh bark like a dog 's , entirely unlike the provocative call he gives during the mating season . Species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs other birds , monkeys , deer , even buffalo and elephants , that a tiger has arrived , while ordinary bird song does n't disturb a single creature . A successful hunter learns to interpret a whole system of animal sounds . They frequently guide him to his quarry . Does this system include laughter ? Do animals have a sense of humor ? I do n't know . But if they do , they must tell one another some hilarious stories about that strange creature called man . They 've got plenty of material for high comedy . Hunting is full of humor . I knew a British officer who fancied himself a hunter . He had read books written by Jim Cor  --  bett and others who had gone after big game in India , and he knew all about tying a bait , and sitting on a machan , and shooting the tiger or leopard attracted by the bait . He had a platform built overlooking an open patch of jungle ; had a goat tied at a good shooting angle , and went out after dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the goat , and began to maul it . There was a tremendous mix-up in the clearing . The leopard snarled ferociously , the goat screamed in terror , and the hunter raised his gun for a shot . The report caused the two animals to break apart , like boxers obeying the referee . A moment later only one remained . The leopard had vanished . The goat lay stiff . The hunter had killed it with his shot . He bagged his bait and scared off the cat . Another time this same officer asked me whether there was good shooting in a particular area . I told him he could find plenty of game at a small stream with a salt lick frequented by hun  --  dreds of animals . This was near our buffalo camp , a site chosen by the buffalo contractors so that their herds could wallow in the water and the mud . The wild animals would come down by night , after the daily bus  --  tle subsided . " Douse the lights in your basha , " I advised the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep silent , and you 'll be able to get a deer . " He took my advice . Quiet reigned over the camp the night he chose to go hunting . Around mid  --  night a shot rang out from near the salt lick . His men assumed that he had spotted a deer and opened up with his rifle . Then came another shot , and another , and another . . . He fired a dozen or so times within a few minutes . They could n't figure out why he took so many shots in the darkness . " Maybe , " said one , " a herd of elephants have come up to his basha and he 's trying to drive them off . " The men went down to the salt lick to find out . They found the of  --  ficer very pleased with himself . " Sambars all over the place , " he explained . " Big stags with magnificent horns . I brought down a number of them . " The men wanted to go and have a look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know what I 'm doing . When you 've hit big game . you do n't go after them on foot in the dark . The stags I shot got up and staggered off . In the morning we 'll find the blood trail and follow them . They ca n't have gone very far . " He and his men were out bright and early next morning . They found the blood trail in the grass , followed it , and came to the corpse of ... a buf  --  falo belonging to the camp contractor . They went on and discovered another timber camp buffalo . Then another . And another . The hunter had decimated our buffalo herd , killing seven of the beasts that the day before had been dragging teak logs to the stream . He had mistaken them for sambars and had kept banging away until none were left . He had to pay a good share of his salary to placate the irate buffalo contractor . once heard about a misadventure with a tiger that had a strange ending ? not funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hun  --  ter sat up one night and bagged his tiger , which leaped into the air when the bullet struck , twist  --  ed around clawing at the air , and collapsed . The hunter put a second bullet into him just to be sure he would n't get up . The next morning , when some villagers arrived , the man pointed to the body stretched out near the bait . Climbing down from his machan , he strode up to it . The tiger lay completely still , its eyes closed , no sign of breathing at its muzzle or its flanks . " Dead be  --  fore it hit the ground , " the hunter commented to the villagers . Triumphantly he gave the body a heavy kick in the rump . The " corpse " whirled upright , swiped at him with its paw , and killed him in  --  stantly . This man had n't learned the lessons of the jungle , one of which is to beware of a big cat lying with its eyes closed . If the eyes are open in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes are closed , it may or may not be dead . To mistake a dead tiger for a live one is funny . To do the reverse is always dangerous and can be deadly . On the lighter side , with a happier ending , I had a good friend , a Burmese hunter from a jungle village . He never could afford a gun , but he borrowed a twelve-gauge shotgun and went deer hunting at night . He was expecting a sambar when a tiger came along toward his machan , and the opportunity seemed too good to ignore . He took a shot at the tiger . The buckshot struck the beast in the head and body , but it escaped into the grass . Of course my friend waited until the morning , and finding no sign of the tiger , he went back to the village to ask for reinforcements in trailing it . Most Burmans are ready for this kind of sport . Besides , they do n't want an injured tiger lurking near their village , so it was n't hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took the lead carry  --  ing the gun , and they picked up the blood trail and followed it into a patch of jungle dominated by a thick clump of bamboo surrounding a tall tree . Suddenly the tiger bounded out of the clump with a roar . By reflex , everyone swarmed up the bamboo to get out of the way ? everyone except the fellow who had done the shooting . The tiger came after him , and he did n't have time to raise the gun . He lit out around the bamboo clump while his companions , safe up above , called out superfluous advice : " Run , run , he 's trying to catch you ! " The tiger could have taken him in a couple of bounds except that it kept veering wide to make the turn around the clump . Now , my friend was wearing a silk turban , the type that Burmans fancy , and as he went under one bamboo tree , a branch swept the turban from his head . The cloth fell onto the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tiger sat down , pawing at this unfamiliar obstruction . Mean  --  while , the Burmese hunter came running around the clump full tilt and nearly collided with the tiger , which he thought was still on his heels . The gun was pointed in the right direction . All he had to do was pull the trigger . That saved him , but he did no more tiger shooting . " I practically rode on that tiger 's back , " he used to say . " Never again . " There 's no accounting for the behavior of hunters . A very clever chap came out to hunt with me in 1955 , an American , about twenty seven years old , who later became a professo4 and already was the model of the absent-minded professor . He was forever searching for things right under his nose . Once we took off our shoes to cross a stream , and he became very excited about the fact that he had lost his until I pointed out that he was carrying them in one hand . Sometimes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on accom panying me on reconnoitering expeditions when Continued on page 176 // continued from page 10 lie was a hindrance rather than a help . I was afraid that he might get himself killed on a hunt . Actually , he came close to getting me killed . We were up in Assam near the Brahmaputra River . I built a ma  --  chan where we could look over a field of long grass to the river some two hundred fifty yards ahead . Off to one side , a little farther away , there was a cattle shed where a Gurkha herdsman took care of the animals . This Gurkha and I had been in the Burma campaign at the same time , so we did a lot of remi  --  niscing and got to be good friends . When I needed a buffalo for the tiger hunt , he let me have a scrawny one that would do for bait . I staked the buffalo out , got up on the machan with my amateur hunter , and waited . My companion disturbed me im  --  mediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowing a couple . When I asked the obvious question , he explained , " Caffeine tablets to keep me awake . " But they did n't keep him awake ? I had to keep nudging him as he dozed off with a gentle snore . All at once , the buffalo was up on its feet , jerking frantically at the rope binding it to the stake . It had seen the tiger before I did , and the cat had come too close to the machan for me to speak without alerting him . 1 dug my elbow into the hunter 's side , gave a slight ges  --  ture toward the tiger with my hand , and nodded my advice to shoot . Be  --  fore he got the gun to his shoulder , the tiger had made a few feints at the buffalo , got through the de  --  fenses of its horns and hoofs , and killed it . 1 said , " Fire ! " He pulled the trig  --  ger . The tiger began to scramble wildly around the clearing , hit but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . " Fire ! " I explod  --  ed . " Fire ! " He did n't obey . He sat there watching while the cat , now aware of our presence , rushed into the grass where we could n't see it any more . " Why did n't you shoot ? " I demanded . He replied , " I do n't know . " All I could do was shake my head in bewilderment . We had a wounded tiger to deal with . Early in the morning the Gurkha came out and joined us on the machan . Later a mahout who was helping me with the hunt ar  --  rived with an elephant , and we all climbed aboard for a sortie into the grass . After some fruitless combing of the area , the Gurkha climbed a tree for a look around . He was re  --  porting no sign of the tiger any  --  where near when it suddenly poked its head through the grass a few yards away . I fired two quick shots , hitting the tiger , but also causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . I did a back  --  ward somersault off the elephant , landed in the grass near the cat , flipped over on my side fishing des  --  perately for another cartridge , and somehow managed to load my gun in time for a third shot that did the trick . On the trip home I had trou  --  ble being civil to my companion of the hunt . However , he came back to me in 1961 , and I went out with him again . He felt he knew much more about hunting this time , so he in  --  sisted on sitting alone near a ford of the Brahmaputra . With a couple of my men , I prepared the area , stak  --  ing out a goat for bait . We had just finished when he produced a fishing reel , played out a length of tine , and said , " Tell your men to tie this to the goat 's leg . " I inquired what he was about . " If the goat does n't bleat , " he explained , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will attract the tiger . " I tried to tell him that the tiger would discover the goat without assistance , but he insisted on having his way . I had the line tied to the goat 's leg , the hunter settled himself to wait with the reel in his hand next to his gun , and I went off and left him . At about nine o'clock that night I was drinking tea when I heard an unfamiliar sound coming from the Brahmaputra ford , a whirring noise that gave me the feeling something was wrong . I went down with my men to see if the hunter out there was O.K. , and along a stretch of the river 1 saw the body of the goat with the tracks of a tiger around it . From his pug marks , I could tell that he had scrambled up the bank in a big hurry , clearly bothered by something behind him . We went to the spot where the hunter was waiting . " The tiger came and grabbed the goat , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play out , and the reel was jammed in my hand against the gun . I could n't get the gun up whenthe reel was jerked from my hand . It bumped and bounced after the tiger , going ' whirr ! whirr ! ' The tiger ran a little distance with the thing clattering at his heels . Then he drop  --  ped the goat and ran away up the bank . " Tigers are easily frightened , espe  --  cially when they 're in a situation that puzzles them . I saw a perfect example of this during World War 11 . Since the campaign took place in the jungles of Burma , we overran tiger haunts time after time . Unfor  --  tunately , many of them turned into man-eaters because they found so many unburied corpses along jungle trails Chinese units were badly shot up by the Japanese , they did n't have sufficient medical supplies , and they had to leave the dead where they fell during a retreat . I would have preferred to shoot these man-eaters whenever we spotted them , but too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion . On this occasion , the Japanese came and attacked us from one side of a stream , while we held the opposite bank . It was a narrow stream , perhaps thirty feet wide , and the banks were quite steep . We cleared a firing space near a patch of very tall grass , and prepared a hot reception for the enemy . Any  --  way , the Japanese came through the tall grass , shouting " Banzai ! " and firing their rifles . And then there came an unexpected sound from the grass , the loud roar of an angry and frightened tiger . Out he rushed into our cleared space . He got across the river in a headlong scramble and raced down the line past our row of foxholes . The sight was too much for one of our Kachins , who stood up and fired at him . The rest of our men for  --  got the enemy momentarily . Theystood up and began taking pot shots at the tiger , who ducked his tail between his legs every time a bullet thudded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauntlet . Un  --  touched by the flying lead , he gal  --  loped into the jungle . With the tiger out of the way , we went back to our war . A peaceful tiger came my way once when I was hunting for deer along a stream . I heard a splash as if a heavy object had hit the water , and , walking a little way , I saw a tiger standing in the stream staring down into it . A frog hopped out onto the bank , Like a flash , the ti  --  ger pounced on it and gobbled it up . Then he went a little farther , flushed some more frogs , and had them for dinner too . It was an ex  --  traordinary sight . You think of the tiger as the monarch of the jungle , killing buffalo and boars and ante  --  lope , and here was this one dining on the lowly frog . Although I thought of shooting him , I was really glad that he turned aside and went away before pro  --  viding me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in  --  jured , no longer capable of catching his usual prey . That made him a prime candidate for man-eater . In  --  stead , he contented himself with frogs . He deserved to get away . When it comes to the amusing , the comical , the sardonic , the ab  --  surd in tiger stories , there 's no es  --  caping Sam Barry . l never met Sam Barry , but his story was familiar to everyone in Assam , where he start  --  ed a new tea estate . He was clearing the jungle so his men could lay out the gardens , but the area was still pretty wild at the time of this in  --  cident . A man-eating tiger had killed a few people in the jungle . One eve  --  ning a man came to Sam Barry and warned him that the brute had been sion of her mouth , began abusing him . The beggar drew a log of wood towards him irresolutely , set it up between his feet , and diffidently drew the axe across it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew it towards him , breathed on his frozen hands , and again drew the axe along it as cautiously as though he were afraid of its hitting his galosh or chopping off his fingers . The log fell over again . Skvortsov 's wrath had passed off by now ; he felt sore and ashamed at the thought that he had forced an enfeebled , drunken , and perhaps sick man to do hard , rough work in the cold . " Never mind , let him go on ... " he thought , going from the dining room into his study . " 1 am doing it for his good ! " An hour later Olga appeared and announced that the wood had been chopped . " Here , give him half a ruble , " said Skvortsov . " If he likes , let him come and chop wood on the first of every month .. .. There will always be work for him . " On the first of the month the beg  --  gar turned up and again earned half a ruble , though he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning up frequently , and work was always found for him : sometimes he would sweep the snow into heaps , or clear up the shed , at another he usedto beat the rugs and the mattresses . He always received thirty to forty kopeks for his work , and on one occasion an old pair of trousers was sent out to him . When he moved , Skvortsov en  --  gaged him to assist in packing and moving the furniture . On this occa  --  sion the beggar was sober , gloomy , and silent ; he scarcely touched the furniture , walked with hanging head behind the furniture vans , and did not even try to appear busy ; he merely shivered with the cold , and was overcome with confusion when the men with the vans laughed at his idleness , his feebleness , and the ragged coat that had once been a gentleman 's . After the removal Skvortsov sent for him . " Well , I see my words have had an effect upon you , " he said , giving him a ruble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sober and not disin  --  clined to work . What is your name ? " " Lushkov . " " I can offer you better work , not so rough , Lushkov . Can you write ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then go with this note tomor  --  row to my colleague and he will give you some copying to do . Work , do n't drink , and do n't forget what I said to you . Goodbye . " Skvortsov , pleased that he had put a man in the path of rectitude , patted Lushkov genially on theshoulder , and even shook hands with him at parting . Lushkov took the letter , departed , and from that time forward did not come to the back  --  yard for work . Two years passed . One day as Skvortsov was standing at the ticket office of a theater , paying for his ticket , he saw beside him a little man with a lambskin collar and a shabby catskin cap . The man timidly asked the clerk for a gallery ticket and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " asked Skvortsov , recognizing in the little man his former woodchopper . " Well , what are you doing ?

I am very , very glad , Lushkov . You know , in a way , you are my godson . It was 1 who shoved you into the right way . Do you re  --  member what a scolding I gave you , eh ? You almost sank through the floor that time . Well , thank you , my dear fellow , for remembering my words . " " Thank you too , " said Lushkov . " If I had not come to you that day , maybe I should be calling myself a schoolmaster or a student still . Yes , in your house 1 was saved , and climbed out of the pit .

What you said that day was excellent ; I am indebted to you as long as I live , of course , but it was your cook , Olga , who really saved me . " " How was that ? " " Why , it was like this . I used to come to you to chop wood and she would begin : Ah , you drunkard ! You God-forsaken man ! And yet death does not take you ! ' and then she would sit opposite me , lament  --  ing , looking into my face and wail  --  ing : ' You unlucky fellow !

I only know that what she said and the noble way she behaved brought about a change in my soul , and I shall never forget it . It 's time to go up , though , they are just going to ring the bell . " Lushkov bowed and went off to the gallery . rs
