" I could see his image by the basement window , " Adams testified . " I watched him about 6 or 7 minutes .

" Adams said he dr opped Barnes off at his South Side home , and Barnes told him he would get rid of the death gun . Back at his own home , Adams said , he destroyed a picture of George Jayne and all other items which might link him to the crime . The next day , he said , LaPlaca gave him $15,000 and the following day handed him another $15,000 . Of the total , he said , he gave Barnes $12,500 and kept the rest .

In September and October they made weekly trips , sometimes in Adams ' car and sometimes in rented cars , to George Jayne 's home , looking for a chance to kill him . The killing , the prosecution contends , climaxed some 12 years of feuding between the . brothers over their competition in horse shows . Both were well known breeders of show horses . The defense is headed by F. Lee Bailey , noted Boston attorney . The defense has contended Adams ' version is false , that he concocted it to save himself .

On cross - f , XaMinatiOnt Bailey hammered at Adams ' bungling and his having no remorse over Jayne 's death . Bailey said Adams was careless in using the same weapon that he had used while target shooting on Silas Jayne 's farm because it could be traced by bullets found on the farm , and in using his own car . Adams later admitted to " conscience pangs " when reading of Jayne 's death in newspapers .
