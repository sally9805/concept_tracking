One of the least arguable contentions of the feminist movement is that a woman should be able to borrow as much money , and as easily , as a man of the same ability to repay . But women can cite many examples of pervasive discrimination against them in the granting of credit , such as these : <P> &gt; Cynthia E. Harrison , a New Jersey woman , was turned down by Chase Manhattan Bank for a BankAmericard although she maintained a considerable balance in a savings account . Just two weeks later she got a form letter from the bank addressed to a sexually unidentifiable " C.E. " Harrison , who was greeted as " Dear Preferred Customer " and offered a card . <P> &gt; Mary King , of Washington , D.C. , organized her own management consulting firm two years before she was married . Even so , her banker recently asked her to get the co-signature of her husband , who has nothing to do with the business , before he would grant a small loan . <P> &gt; When Carol Faill returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania government agency for a stateinsured college loan , she complimented her banker on his enlightened disregard for a husband 's co-signature . " Oh , " said the banker , " I did n't realize ... " Her husband had to cosign . <P> Now prospects for the lessening of discrimination are brightening . A federal law banning sex bias in the granting of credit goes into effect next week , and last week the Federal Reserve Board published rules for enforcing it that are tougher than many creditors would have liked . Also last week a movement by women to organize their own banks and credit unions gained momentum when the long-delayed First Women 's Bank opened in New York . <P> Strict Rules . Of the two developments , the pending enforcement of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 is clearly the more important ; the law applies to all banks , finance companies , credit-card issuers , department stores and other major lenders . Congress wrote the act in general terms and left it to the Federal Reserve to spell out just what lenders must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Federal Trade Commission ) . The Federal Reserve last April proposed a fairly strict set of rules but in response to protests from creditors came out in September with a greatly weakened set of regulations . That raised a howl from women , and in the final rules announced last week , they won back much of what they had lost . <P> Among other things , the regulations specify that lenders may not consider sex or marital status in judging an applicant 's worthiness to receive credit and that wives who open accounts after Nov. 1 , 1976 must be given credit ratings separate from those of their husbands . The rules flatly forbid lenders to ask a woman about her birth control practices or childbearing plans-an intrusive procedure that has been declining in frequency but still exists . Also , as of Jan. 31 , a lender who refuses credit must , when asked , tell the would-be borrower why . This point had been eliminated altogether from the September regulations .                @ @ @ @ @
