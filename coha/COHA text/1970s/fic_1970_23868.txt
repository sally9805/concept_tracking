a story by Bruce Jay Friedman JUST BACK FROM THE COAST A t the time Apollo II took off for the moon , ,  - -  Harry Towns was in a reclining chair beside the pool at a Beverly Hills hotel , taking advantage of the first stretch of absolutely perfect weather he had run into in Los Angeles . On previous trips of his , whenever it rained or was generally dismal , someone would say , - " I do n't understand . It 's never done this before , this time of year . " When something went wrong in Los Angeles , people tended to say it was the first time in memory it had ever happened that way . Things did n't go wrong that often . And there was certainly nothing to quibble about on this trip . A poolside philosopher , sitting next to Towns , said the pool area at the hotel was probably the only enclave in the world in which people were totally oblivious to that trip to the moon . " That 's because they probably have n't figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow said . Towns was thinking about the moon landing , but in the cool , even California sun , he could not honestly say it was pressing heavily on his mind . He was winding up his L.A. trip , milking the last juice out of it , and had it worked out so that he would stay slightly involved in the flight in California and then see the actual landing on the moon when he was back in New York . His son was away at summer camp and had asked Towns to round up at least twenty copies of the New York Times edition that reported the landing . " Can you imagine what copies of the Wright Brothers newspaper would be worth today ? " he had asked . Towns thought his son was very enterprising and made a sacred pledge to round up the papers , although secretly he decided ten was plenty for the kid . Meanwhile , he was busy loving California . He had taken some short probing trips to the Coast before , barely taking time to get unpacked , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though some of the seeds he had scattered earlier had come into flower . People fell in love with California by the carload , but he wondered if anyone had experienced quite the love affair he was having with the state . Did anyone love the orange juice as much as he did . It knocked him on his ear every time he had a fresh glass of it in the morning . The same went for the lettuce . Who ever heard of lettuce that had so much bite and spank and crunch to it . He loved the salad oils and so far he had not come across a wine that did n't taste marvelous . He began to guzzle it like water and that was another thing ; he never got drunk in Los Angeles no matter how much he had to drink . It was like being in a super-rarefied health simulator that did n't let you get drunk . In the way of many New Yorkers , he had spoken a bit too fondly of New York restaurants on the plane to L.A , , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else , The fellow next to him , who had been quite jovial up to this point , suddenly dropped his voice and in a surprisingly ominous , almost cruel tone , asked , " Which restaurants did you go to in Los Angeles ? " " 1 believe I 've offended you , " Towns said . " I believe you have , " said the fellow . Then , in the style of a trial attorney with a witness on the hook , he asked Towns if he had been to such and such a place and such and such a place , rattling off a dozen winners and not waiting for Towns to say he had n't heard of that one nr had n't gotten around to that other one . The once-friendly fellow then gave Towns the world 's thinnest smile and went to sleep . In Los Angeles , Towns tried a few of the fellow 's suggestions and they were first-rate all right , although they tended to go in as heavily for ceremony as they did fur food . A waitress would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Jo Smith , your waitress for tonight and here is your special chilled fork for the Brasilia Festival Salad . " If anyone had tried that number on him in New York , he or one of his friends would have done twenty minutes on it , probably right in front of Mary Jo Smith . You could not admit you liked elaborate curtsied ceremonies in New York . It seemed perfectly all right in Los Angeles . More than the restaurants and theaters and homes , it was the getting to them that he really enjoyed . He loved getting dressed in the cool shady early evening and then stopping in the middle since all you ever had to be was half-dressed in L.A. It was not very typical of his life , but he had once taken a journey that had brought him to ancient walled-up cities in Central Asia . He would not have wanted the job of convincing anyone , but that high , dizzy , pulsing feeling he had each time he approached the Strip was every bit as profound as what he felt upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished by the cleanliness of the light along the Strip , the slow , clean tumble of beautiful blond children , the outrageous brilliance of the high posters advertising Lake Tahoe entertainment trios but looking more like huge movies shown in the sky . How did they get those pictures so large and startling and clear .... He was aware , of course , that so much of it had to do with him and not California . He was fond of saying , " When I get to the West Coast , there 's absolutely no hassle . " ( He used such expressions in California . He said depressing people were " downers , " a had experience was a " bummer " and even caught himself describing a lively girl as a " dynamite chick . " He did not speak that way in New York . There was always someone who would make a face . ) In California , he had no debts , no broken marriage , no glum heartbroken feelings of work undone . Let him pass a day in New York without working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . In California there were always going to be other days . There was always plenty of time . He would feel the drumbeat of excitement the moment he got on the plane and headed for the West Coast . The many concerns would drop from his shoulders like an ancient overcoat , glum , massive , many sizes too large , one he had inherited from his forebears and pledged in blood to wear through all seasons . He was a stranger in L.A. and he preferred it that way . There was no one looking over his shoulder , no one taking notes . He would not arrive in Los Angeles so much as roll into town in the style of mysterious Western heroes slowly loping into strange Montana outposts . He preferred keeping relationships his most unfavorite word ) casual , transient , and when he got to L.A. there was no one he raced to the phone to call . His one close friend was a chemist who had never married and was arrested , socially , at the college level ; he loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambda Chi 's at Purdue . Towns had dinner with this fellow once a trip . He had a sprinkling of friends in L.A. , a bartender here , a waitress there , some people in the film colony . What he loved to do was set out in the evening with no date and no particular destination , relying on the peculiar sense of recklessness that possessed him in California . In New York , he might be struck by the beauty of a salesgirl , flirt with her a bit , and then settle for a week 's worth of tormented dreams . In Los Angeles , if a girl fell into an intriguing posture , more often than not , he would simply scoop her up and whisk her away for the night . In most situations , he did not have the faintest idea of what he was going to do . It made him dangerous and at the same time exciting company for himself . In the event his nightly quests for adventure turned out a bit wilted , he had a few late  --  night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a slightly over-the-hill TV ingenue who would generally take him in . And one late-night club where he could always count on a few familiar faces . There was that special tribe of long-legged golden women that had always evaded him , dancing slightly beyond his reach . Some called them vacant , mindless , not worth the trouble . Ding-a-lings . A dark-haired dancer he knew saw him staring and said , " They 're not worthy of you . " But how he yearned for them . On previous trips , his adventures had been with cashiers , hustlers , leftover women on the frayed corners of L.A. life . But always he had felt an awareness of that golden tribe , eyes aloof , carriage regal , long hair trickling down tan delicious shoulders . On this trip , it had somewhat come together for him . Early on , he found an angry one . Angry when he met her , angry in bed , skulking off in a furor after a night of angered , begrudging love . She told him that yellow hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an actor with a marred career . Perhaps what really irritated her was that Harry Towns had trapped her , straggling beyond the golden caravan . In any case , she was an official card-carrying member of the tribe . He had made contact . Soon after , he found another , standing high and golden on a stationery store ladder . Dusting boxes . " A girl like you dusting ? " he said , not the most spectacular remark . But all things were possible in Los Angeles . " Actually , " she said , " I 've been looking for something else . " He took her back to the hotel and at one point made her get out of bed and stand on a ladder , stationery-store-style . It was all right with her . Watching her that way . he fought for breath . He had one of those extraordinary sun girls up on a ladder , tan legs straining , just fur him . L.A. was some town . It had been that kind of a trip , fat , rich , lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call away . Now , at poolside on a late Friday afternoon , Towns felt the first stirrings of regret at having to leave Los Angeles . His work was completed . If he stayed any longer , he would have to pay his own bills . Not an attractive prospect for Harry Towns . All dollars aside , it struck him that part of the magical fun of Los Angeles was having someone else pay your way . He had to visit his son at camp within the next week , so he would be leaving in any case . Towns had promised to store up anecdotes about film stars for his young son . So far he had only run into stars of Forties movies which were n't going to mean anything to the boy . He reminded himself to go to places where the stars hung out that night and try to see some for the boy so he could report on what they were up to . T he crowning touch to this trip had been a lovely divorcee who had appeared to him at the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a quick fantasy thumbnail sketch as he always did on people who interested him . Ile made her out to be the wife of a doctor , a gracious dinner-party.giver , very strong on fund raising for charities ; the doctorwas indeed to be congratulated because she also kept herself in marvelous trim , working hard at it since she had to be getting on in her thirties . A private thing about her was that she was given to sudden and delightful thrusts of vulgarity , both in and out of bed . The combination of fund-raising good looks and the flash of filthy stuff was irresistible . He did some laps in the pool , had a breath-holding contest with himself to see how much older he was getting , and when he surfaced , wet , bearded and shining at the shallow end , she was waiting for him , legs tucked beneath her . " The Christ resemblance really does cry out for comment , " she said . She was a three-time loser in marriage , had a grown son , and had run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The husband lived about twelve miles away . He owned retail stores and was not a doctor , but Towns was right about the dinner parties . He was not very far off target on the sudden flashes of vulgarity , either . Towns was not sure he would be able to get that favorite California wine of his in New York , and now that he was leaving he wanted to have as much of it as possible . Over glasses of it . she said she had been in love only once , to a silent boy who drifted in and out of her life at college . After an incredibly short period , she looked at Towns and said , " I fear it 's happening to me a second time . " They drifted back to Towns ' suite . Why was it so easy to get girls to drift back to suites in California and such a major operation in New York . They made love for a short while : he marked her as the kind of girl who liked to spend a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramifications . " It 's not been that good for me , " she said . " In so many ways I wish I had never noticed a tanned and bearded fellow coming out of the pool like Christ reborn . " She said , however , that anytime he wanted her , no matter where he was , she would come to him and he could use her in any way he wanted , so lung as it did n't involve having another girl watch or anything in that family . When he was a younger man , such an invitation would have paralyzed his senses . Now it only sounded fairly good . In any ease , she left a bracelet behind and then called to ask if she could come by to get it . So now he waited for her , and it occurred to him that all he had done to attract her was act a bit distant , keeping his jaw set as though he had hen through some grim times and did n't want to talk about them . He reminded himself to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occurred to him that if his wife were to meet him for the first time now  --  and he were to behave the way he had with the divorcee  --  she would probably be terribly attracted to him and not be in Dubrovnik . Laie in the afternoon , he began to get a little edgy . He wished the girl would come get her bracelet and disappear . There was some good sun remaining and it was almost as though he could not really soak it up properly if he were scanning about looking for someone . He thought about the astronauts and felt guilty about his plan to skip over the flight to the moon and come in at the last minute for the landing . And he was sorry he had n't been involved in the historic flight in any way . The story was that all Americans were involved in the landing , but he was one who was n't . Even doing public-relations work for an outfit that made computers would have been something . Why was n't he at a TV set , urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a great new TV set for the occasion . The stores would be closed in New York on Sunday , so he would have to pick one up in Los Angeles and take it back with him . It was a way of showing respect to the astronauts . Instead of hanging out a flag , he would finally get a clear TV set . When she showed up , cool and blond in a white dress , he changed his mind about wanting to get rid of her quite that fast . He was not exactly over-brimming with desire , but on the other hand there was no point in wasting her either . They had some more of the great wine and she said , - Just talking to you I feel I 'm making love to you . " " I do n't feel that way , " he said . " Then why do n't you grab me by the neck and take me back to your room . " " I do n't do that , " he said . She went back with him anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making any wrong moves . If he had gone in for a furious bout of nose-picking she would have found something charming about it . His comparisons were generally sporting ones . It was like one of those days in which everything you throw up sails right through the net . " Have you noticed . " she said , during the period thrown over to analysis , " that in our lovemaking I 've been concerned primarily with pleasing you and not the slightest in pleasing myself . " " I wondered about that , " he said . After she left , he checked to make sure there were no more of her bracelets around . H e was happy she was gone , but as soon as he was alone in the room , he decided it was not going to go well if he hung around any longer and he might as well leave Los Angeles as soon as possible , more or less on a high note . Early the next morning he bought a small TV set from a tiny Japanese man who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Towns could n't get over how sharp and clear the picture was . He was not very mechanical , but he loved tiny , intricately made gadgets and had a vision of filling up a warm , comfortable apartment with them , living in it and spending most of his time turning them on and off . He felt a sudden burst of love for the tiny Japanese man who was practically a transistor himself and wanted to bend over and give him a hug . The fellow was very tiny and Towns wondered what would happen if he caught a disease that made you lose weight . He would probably just get a little smaller and stay all right . The fellow fixed up the TV box with a tricky little tissue-paper handle so that Towns would n't chafe his hands carrying itand Towns loved the handle almost as much as he did the TV set . The American version of that handle would have involved rows of factory workers and probably would n't have been as comfortable to the hand . Admittedly , it would have lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go to Japan some day although he was convinced he would be guilty of hair-raising breaches of social etiquette almost as soon as he set foot in the country . He did n't want to hang around any longer . As soon as he got back to his hotel , he changed his plane reservation so that he would be'back in New York in plenty of time to watch the landing on the delicious little new TV set . Then he had a last lunch in Los Angeles in a marvelously crumbled outdoor restaurant , ordering a last bottle of the great wine . The driver who took hint to the airport said Towns looked like he was in the film business and asked if Towns could get him a copy of a film script , any script . so that he could study the form and then try one of his own . Towns could n't see why they were so hard to get  --  surely libraries and bookstores carried tons of them  --  but the fellow said you 'd be surprised how tough it was to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said when he got to New York he would certainly try to rustle one up . His idea was to take the little TV set back to his apartment in New York City and watch the moon landing there . The timing was set up just right . All that had to happen was for the plane to land on schedule and not get involved in any traffic tie-ups over JFK . One of the stewardesses sat next to Towns in the lounge and told him she had been all closed up for a long time , all through her childhood , but that she had opened up the previous fall . If Towns had been going to Los Angeles and not coming back from it , he probably would have asked if she was open or closed at the moment , but as it was , he let it slide . He did n't like to start in when he was on his way to New York . As it happened , the plane landed on time , but the porter who picked up his luggage slammed the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase on top of it ; Towns was sure he 'd done some massive damage to the set . " Do n't you know there 's a goddamn TV set in there , " he said to the porter . In some strange way , he took it all as a direct attack on the tiny polite little Japanese man . " I did n't know that , " said the porter . " Anyway , there 's no way to guarantee smooth passage . " He had the feeling that no little TV set could survive a shot like that so he took it out of the box , attached the battery pack and switched it on in the terminal . Some sputtering pictures showed up . " See that , " said the porter , " she coming in good . " It came as no great surprise to Towns when the pictures bleeped out and turned to darkness . There was a package of warranties in the box , but Towns had no heart to get started with them . Besides , he had the feeling that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what you did to it . He gave the porter a look and then tossed the set lightly into a trash container . Someone in the ter-minal said the astronauts were going to be down in forty-five minutes . There was n't any time to fool around now . Towns kept a key to his wife 's house on the outskirts of the city and told a cabbie to take him there . The cabbie was certain Towns was going to get in the cab and then say he really wanted to go to Brooklyn . All through the ride he kept looking around suspiciously at Towns , expecting to be told to swerve off the highway and head back to the hated borough . When they were well out in the suburbs , the cabbie relaxed and said he could n't believe his luck , getting a call to go to the country and not Brooklyn . As they neared the house , Towns became a little apprehensive even though he knew his wife was in Yugoslavia and his son was off to camp . Maybe he would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , sleeping in his old bed . T he house was a little damp , but otherwise it was eerily the way he had left it , with no signs of orgiastic frenzy . A next-door neighbor 's house was occupied and Towns wondered if his kid was being teased for not having a clad around . That never once occurred to him in Los Angeles . He stayed in the kitchen awhile , eating a slice of Swiss cheese which seemed to be in remarkably good shape . The kitchen was the most beautiful room in the house , jammed with extraordinary knickknacks that had been accumulated over years of a marriage . He felt a little sorry for himself , spending all that time and money , helping to accumulate knickknacks and then never again getting to enjoy them . He had often said that possessions did n't mean a damned thing ; all that counted was friendships anti how you felt but he sure did love knickknacks and wondered whether he should n't have taken a few along . He went upstairs then , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , sleeping in his old bed and waiting for his old wife to get back from Dubrovnik . What if his wife took up with a fellow who was a strict disciplinarian and went around disciplining his kid ? The California divorcee said she had run into that in her second marriage and had had to clear out so that her son would n't get seriously hurt . Towns would have to come back and slam the guy around a little . He decided to watch the landing in his son 's room , That way ; when he went up to visit the boy , he would be able to give him a report on how his room was getting along . The boy had a TV set propped up next to his bed and Towns remembered bawling out the kid when he saw him smack the set a few times to get it into focus . It turned out that the boy was right and the only way to get it to work right was to smack it around a few times . The boy 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of skyscrapers . The boy had some talent as an artist and Towns figured the leaping apes just represented a period he was going through , although he had to admit he had certainly been in that period for a long time . He was n't too worried about it . All men who had amounted to anything had probably done things that seemed a little weird at the time . He checked around the room , getting the feel of the kid again and remembering some of the time he had spent in there , helping him fix it up . Then he sat down on the boy 's bed and spotted the empty animal cage . The year previous , with the boy away at camp , he had gotten a call from the camp director saying the boy missed his pet and maybe Towns ought to bring it up to camp on visiting day . As far as the director was concerned it would put the summer over the top for the kid . Towns was feeling low about the marriage , which was splitting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up if he had been asked . So he set out in his car and drove to Vermont with the white mouse in the back , throwing him a carrot whenever the animal got a little restless . That night he stopped off in New Hampshire at a motel , with the idea that he would head for camp early the next morning . The motel had a sign that said No Pets . He registered anyway , and then slipped the animal cage into the room when the owner was n't looking . He had dinner at a local restaurant and when he got back to the motel , he caught the owner in his car headlights , standing with his legs spread apart and pointing to the grass . When Towns got out of the car , the owner said , " I told you no pets . " The animal was lying on its back in the grass . cold and frozen , a sightless eye fixed at the moon . Towns marked the motel owner for life with a heavy ring he wore on his finger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasion . He had to use lawyers , but he got away with it . At camp , he told the boy the animal had caught cold and died peacefully and painlessly in an animal hospital . He said he would get the boy any pet in the world , but the boy said he did n't want any more and kept the empty cage in his room with the door open . Towns wondered if the astronauts went through things like that , whether they had ugly split-ups with wives who subsequently ran off to Dubrovnik , boys who drew pictures of apes leaping from buildings , if they ever wound up scarring men in far-off motels at midnight . His first impulse was to feel no they did n't . They were too sober and well-rooted for that kind of nonsense . Were n't they from " the other America , " as it was so commonly felt in those same circles that were contemptuous of chilled forks and Brasilia Festival salads . But Towns had seen pictures of the pinched and weary faces of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as tidy as it came off in the national magazines . He knew what those long separations for work did to marriages . There was probably no beating the sys-tem even if you were a space pioneer and your wife was an astronautical winner . He decided that they were good men who had tasted failure , ate too much marinara sauce on occasion . lusted after models , worried about cancer and , for all he knew , even had an overquick ejaculation or two . The thought gave him some comfort as he sat down on his boy 's bed , gave the TV set a few shots to get it started , and got set to watch the fulfillment of man 's most ancient dream . 171
