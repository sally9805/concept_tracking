As he prepared to leave the White House staff for a teaching post at Harvard , Daniel Patrick Moynihan was brooding about the morale and the reputation of the Nixon Administration . Somehow , Moynihan thought , the President and his men were dispirited , and sometimes almost half believed their worst press notices-about lack of accomplishment , a certain institutional Republican grayness. an obtuseness and even a repressive urge . <P> With the instinct of a buoyant Irish priest , Moynihan decided to part on an inspirational note . He rose in the White House to speak at a year-end meeting of Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officers , and when he had finished some of the assembled Nixon men were wiping away tears as they stood to applaud . <P> Moynihan began by discussing the problems that the Administration faced as it took office two years ago . He described what had been done-the diminishing war , governmental reform , " racial rhetoric calmed , the great symbol of racial subjugation-the dual school system of the South-quietly and finally dismantled . " He worried about the excessive moralism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed . " As a result , " he said , " we have acquired bad habits of speech and worse patterns of behavior , lurching from crisis to crisis with the attention span of a five-year-old . For all our achievements elsewhere , and for all the durability of the American democracy , we have somehow never learned to be sufficiently thoughtful about the tasks of running a complex society . " <P> Great Simplifiers . Moynihan gave his audience several exhortations and some rather thick flattery : " The first is to be of good cheer and good conscience . Depressing , even frightening things are being said about the Administration . They are not true . This has been a company of honorable and able men , led by a President of singular courage and compassion in the face of a sometimes awful knowledge of the problems and the probabilities that confront him . " <P> The second point was aimed as much at men like Spiro Agnew as at critics from the left : " Resist the temptation to respond in kind to the untruths and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian Jacob Burckhardt foresaw that ours would be the age of ' the great simplifiers , ' and that the essence of tyranny was the denial of complexity . What we need are great complexifiers-men who will not only seek to understand what it is they are about but who will also dare to share that understanding with those for whom they act . " <P> Moynihan concluded : " It is necessary for members of the Administration to be far more attentive to what it is the President has said and proposed . Time and again the President has said things of startling insight , taken positions of great political courage and intellectual daring , only to be greeted with silence or incomprehension even within our own ranks . " <P> The President was obviously delighted and moved as he continued the farewell ceremony , presenting to Moynihan a replica of his Cabinet chair as a souvenir . Nixon reached into his own pocket for the $500 to buy the chair .                   @ @
