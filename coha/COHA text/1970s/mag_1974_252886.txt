WHAT THE WINE-SELLERS BUY by RON MILNER <P> Steve Carlton is a bright and loving son to his widowed mother . He wears a Northeastern High School jacket , dribbles a basketball round the house and spoons with his sweet girl friend Mae , the cheerleader . But Steve falls in with a bad companion from next door , and before long his mother hardly knows him . <P> What the Wine-Sellers Buy , which opened in Manhattan last week , is essentially a sentimental domestic morality play of wayward youth , a play that is a dramatic refugee from the 1950s . EXcept that here the characters are black and the setting is the Detroit ghetto . The bad influence arrives in the form of Rico , a wonderfully reptilian pimp who means to apprentice Steve to his trade by having the lad peddle Mae in the streets . Will Steve choose the life of vice ? Will he break his old mother 's heart , not to mention Mae 's ? <P> The answer is not much more interesting than the question . It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-time Chayefsky framed in a raw ghetto context . Much of the wild street talk is funny , and the acting often superb . Glynn Turman 's Steve is a skillfully subtle combination of pride and confusion . Dick A. Williams ' dazzlingly evil pimp sweeps round the stage , almost a production unto himself , costumed like a Liberace with soul . <P> At last , a sort of Middle American virtue triumphs in the victory of mother , church and romantic love . In the final scene , when Steve rejects the life of sin and sweeps up Mae ( Loretta Greene ) in his arms , her feet leave the floor and you almost expect her , slowly and sensuously , to kick off high-heeled shoes in Hollywood abandon to the last Cuddle .
