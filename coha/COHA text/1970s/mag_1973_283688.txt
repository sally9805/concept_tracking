Even at the height of his popularity , Richard Nixon was never " big at the box office , " as one New York book editor puts it . As a result , publishers have not rushed to recruit past or present White House aides for books about the President . One exception was William Morrow &; Co. of Manhattan . Last February , when Nixon still rode high , Morrow signed a $250,000 contract with William Safire for a book giving his insider 's view as a speechwriter during the President 's first term . Safire , the resident White House wit until he resigned to become a New York Times columnist last April , produced a 350,000-word manuscript , titled A Hurry to Be Great . <P> Now the publisher wants to drop the book and has told Safire to return an $83,000 advance . Lawrence Hughes , president of Morrow , claimed last week that the manuscript was " editorially unacceptable , " despite Safire 's claim that Morrow editors read five chapters - and voiced no qualms - before the contract was signed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's popularity has dived , thus making a " balanced " book about Nixon less likely to sell . Other publishers agree with Safire 's assessment of the market . " The only book that would sell well would be one that exposed Nixon as a crook , " says Vice President Donald Smith of Thomas Y. Crowell . Undaunted , Safire has demanded arbitration , as provided for in his contract with Morrow . " This , " he says , " is the most pernicious kind of censorship - the censorship of the gutless.
