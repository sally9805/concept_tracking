In the greatest public works program since the pharaohs piled up the pyramids , the Government since 1956 has laced the U.S. with 33,000 miles of multilane highways . Nearly all of the $47 billion cost has been paid from the Highway Trust Fund , which lives off the 4-a-gallon federal gasoline tax . The highway program has created much convenience for drivers , countless jobs for workers-and untold profits for auto , oil , tire , cement , construction , motel and other companies . Lately the program has also earned much criticism . <P> In Baltimore , Washington , San Antonio , New Orleans and other cities , protesters have challenged about 200 highway projects . Commuter groups complain that too much is spent on highways and not enough on mass transit . Civil rights groups complain that new highways cut down old urban neighborhoods . Environmentalists complain that the highways , by stimulating auto travel , aggravate air pollution . Protests are rising in Congress . Says Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , Connecticut Republican : " It is inconceivable that we have hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway deaths a year . " <P> New Makeup . Last week , in a surprise move , Transportation Secretary John Volpe proposed making Highway Trust Fund money available for mass transit . The fund now provides about $5 billion a year for federal roads . Under Volpe 's plan , the Government would allow $1 billion of this to be spent on mass transit in 1974 , $1.85 billion in fiscal 1975 and $2.25 billion in subsequent years . Chances of winning congressional approval this year appear dim , but it is important that the Nixon Administration is striving to spread the money around , and it seems inevitable that just that will be done some time in the future . <P> The plan faces opposition of varying intensity from the myriad companies that benefit from highway building , as well as automobile clubs and state highway officials . Together , these forces make up a powerful highway lobby , jokingly dubbed in Washington the " Highwaymen " or the " Road Gang . " Yet some of the major beneficiaries of highway building recognize that changes should and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors and Ford favor diverting at least some of the Highway Trust Fund to subsidize buses and other mass-transit systems that use highways , but not rail transit projects . Ford is promoting a high-speed-bus system , based on a network of guideways built over existing highways that use computer-controlled , Ford-built mini buses capable of carrying ten passengers . The company is building an experimental two-station system for Transpo 72 at Dulles Airport outside Washington . <P> Officers of oil companies-notably Jersey Standard and Mobil-argue that some trust-fund money should be spent on rail as well as highway transit projects . These executives are worried about a future shortage of oil , which they want to conserve . It is remarkable that some top businessmen are contemplating means to reduce demand for their basic product . Even more remarkable , this rejiggering of the oilmen 's past philosophy puts them in the same camp as their most outspoken critics-the environmentalists .
