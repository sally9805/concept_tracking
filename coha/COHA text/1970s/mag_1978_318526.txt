FIRST PERSON RURAL by Noel Perrin David R. Godine ; 124 pages ; $7.95 <P> People who grow their own anything are usually good for about seven minutes of conversation before they suffer an attack of smugness . Apparently their listeners are required to feel inferior because they do not render their own lard or weave their own shirts . Author Noel Perrin , who putters at Vermont farming when he is not teaching English at Dartmouth or writing graceful scholarly books ( Dr. Bawdier 's Legacy ) , deserves a longer hearing . True , Perrin sometimes sounds like a country snob who would be horrified if the supermarket patrons he patronizes actually swarmed to New England in search of the rustic bargains he eulogizes . But even while baiting the slickers , he is consistently entertaining . <P> The 20 pieces reprinted here , mostly from Vermont Life , Country Journal and The New Yorker , range from meditations on the metaphysics of farming to shopping guides on the purchase of chainsaws and pickup trucks . Taken together , they sketch the education of a greenhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant " in the rigors of owning and running his own farm . Perrin recalls the winter morning he awoke to find the temperature outside-26F. , his house at 37 and falling , his oil tank empty . He recounts his early , inept attempts to fence off land from deer , other predators and the forest-making impulse that still thrives in the stony New England soil . <P> Such detailed anecdotes keep Perrin from falling victim to his " Wooden Bucket Principle " : " By this I mean a tendency to imagine almost anything in the country as simpler and more primitive and kind of nicer than it really is . " <P> Still , some of it is simpler and nicer , and these aspects are generously extolled . <P> The new farmer makes cutting up fence posts and driving them into the ground sound like fun . Similarly , he stresses the serendipitous surprises that rural life can offer . Cursing himself for overcooking a batch of sap , Perrin discovers that ruined syrup can still be turned into first-rate maple candy . <P> He is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When his wife makes butter , she uses a blender in stead of a churn . " If I were to move to an old-fashioned farm , " Perrin writes , " and could bring just one piece of modern machinery with me , I would n't hesitate a second . I 'd bring my chainsaw . It 's noisy , it 's dangerous , it pollutes the air-and I love it . " <P> Returning to the land and living off it is a stubborn American dream . It persists even though small farmers are leaving in droves . Without being maudlin about it , Perrin laments their passing and the dis appearance of a way of life that knit hard ships and satisfactions together . He never pretends that part-time farming is the same as the real thing . But by clearing fields and keeping boundaries intact , he at least stages a holding action against total loss . And telling others how he has done it preserves that hold .                   @ @
