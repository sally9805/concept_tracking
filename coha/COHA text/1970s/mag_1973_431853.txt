' 4  | Jealous Wife Almost as far back as I can remember , I wanted to be a doctor 's wife . I suspect it all began when I had my tonsils out somewhere around my sixth birthday and my unbelieving ears heard Dr. Wilson ordering Mom to give me ice cream ( " lots of ice cream ? all she wants to eat ! " ) At that moment I decided that doctors were the nicest , most understanding people in the world . And when I grew up ? well , I wanted one for my very own . That 's why when it came to selecting a career after high school , I chose to go into nurses ' training . I felt a little guilty when I told the dean of admissions why I wanted to be a nurse ? " to help humanity . " That was partly true , of course . But I also had in mind that being a nurse was the best way to meet a doctor . I need n't have felt too guilty . Half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same idea . But there were enough cute young interns and residents to go around . And tired as they were from the strain of long hours and the life-and-death tensions of the hospital , they were always happy to relax for a few minutes with a pretty student nurse . Even the married doctors flirted . I studiously stayed away from those . That was n't what I was interested in . I was always surprised that to some of the girls it really did n't make any difference . Then I met Dave . It was my first day on the maternity ward and I was bringing in a lunch tray for a young woman who had just lost her newborn baby . Dave sat there with her , so strong and so gentle , trying to make her understand that the infant 's death was n't her fault . As I straightened the sheets , I could hear him patiently urging her to eat . He could have been Doc Wilson offering me ice cream . I was hooked .

Just days before my graduation , I discovered I was pregnant . I stayed on at the hos- pital as an RN for several months then went on maternity leave .

He had a long I st of appointments starting at ten . He was just about to call the nurses ' registry when the doorbell rang . ! t was Mrs. Smith , who helped out wit ? cleaning and baby-sitting . " I have an idea , " he said , looking at me " You 're going to be my nurse today It will be good for you to get out c ' the house and into a uniform again Mrs. Smith can stay with the children . " Ha ! Get into a uniform . That was a joke . Not even the uniforms I 'd won in mid-pregnancy would zip up . So we continued on page 27  | upped at a uniform shop on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress that hid the ges . When we got to the office and I hung up my coat , I was surprised to a couple of uniforms hanging in e closet . " Oh , they 're Martha 's , " exained Dave . " They would n't fit you . e 's a size eight or something . " " Why does she leave uniforms re ? " I asked , annoyed at that comment . She often goes out to dinner and movie or shopping after work . So she showers and changes into street clothes ? leaves her uniform here , " he replied very matter-of-factly . How could my husband speak so casually about another woman showerg and dressing while she was alone with him ? I went through that entire y feeling a little uptight . I guess I had always pushed from my mind rat Dave did all day . Examining one roman after another . I always knew at if I thought about it , I 'd only be rturing myself .

But it was lonesome. d when I tried to call him a few rues just to say hello , he seemed annoyed . One morning while he was shaving bout the only time we had to talk thout the children around ) he casually said something about " college kids today being so different from eir mothers , so nice and relaxed out their bodies .

Take this girl who me in today . After the examination , he just dropped the gown and sat continued on page 28  | there , without even a blush . Although Martha was in the room , she began pouring out her troubles with her lawstudent husband . " " Well , what did you do ? " Now I really felt annoyed . " Well , I explained that a young man like hers , still in school , was under great pressures . " " No , " I interrupted . " I mean what did you do about her sitting there stark naked ? " " What could I do ? I was pleased I was shocked . I was sure that would at least try to persuade me go . But he did n't . In fact , he that it was going to be pretty hec for him anyway , with his paper a all ; he 'd be working most of the ti polishing it with Dr. Elwell . That night I was crisp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crime . But he hardly notic He was so preoccupied with h darned paper .

I municate her problem to me , clothes or no clothes . And I tried to help her . " Tried to help her indeed , is all I could think . I slid deeper and deeper into a selfperpetuating despair . I snapped at Dave and the kids , stopped getting my hair done . I wanted to confide in my best friend , but she was in worse trouble than I was . And she did n't even know it . Unfortunately , she was almost the only one in town who did n't . Her attorney husband was having an affair with a liberated lady lawyer . How could I be the one to tell her ? And how could I tell her about my suspicions about Dave ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to get his paper finished and would n't be home at all that night . He would take a cat-nap on the couch in the waiting room if he felt sleepy . But when he said that Martha would stay for a couple of hours and do some typing , I really fumed inside . But I did n't know thought , when he gets back , I 'll ask for twin beds . But the thought was n't very comforting . Next afternoon , Jennifer came home from school and asked . " Mommy , what do you do ? " I did n't know what she meant . " Oh , you know , Mommy . Like Daddy is a doctor and Emily 's mommy is a PTA lady . We 're doing that in school . I 'm supposed to find out . " " I used to be a nurse , " I said offhandedly . " Not used to be , Mommy . Now .

I could sense she wanted to discuss it further , but I was n't in the mood . So I spelled " housewife " for her and sent her out to play .

So I swallowed hard and hung up . Then I thought about Martha 's slim , size-eight uniforms and the size 14 I 'd bought . It was the first 14 I 'd ever worn . But I 'd need a whole new wardrobe of 14s to go to the convention . None of the things I had in my closet fit . Suddenly , I did n't want to go to the convention . Next night at dinner , I told Dave I 'd decided to stay home . I told him that I did n't have time to get the clothes I needed . He did n't even blink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get something that looks right , that might be best . Your outfits have been looking kind of dowdy lately . Guess that extra weight is showing . " cided to call Mrs. Smith in to sit with the children and drive downtown to a movie . The film was just what I needed ? I hated the two-timing husband , and cried for myself and the heroine at the same time . When I walked out into the dimly lit street from the bright lobby , I was still wiping my red eyes . And I almost bumped right into Dr. Goodson , a general practitioner who has an office in Dave 's building . " Mamie ! " he exclaimed . " I 'm surprised to see you in town . I thought you 'd be at the convention with Dave . " I was flustered . How could I tell him why Dave did n't want me at the continued on page 32  | convention ? Hardly distinguishing between myself and the wronged movie wife , I was too upset to say anything . Dr. Goodson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned country doctor . A real Marcus Welby , people sometimes say . He took both my hands and just held them for a moment . Then he asked , " How about a cup of coffee at that place across the street ? " " I 'd rather not , " I mumbled . " My eyes are all red from crying at that movie . " " Well , then , why do n't we just stop at my office for a few minutes . being as its so close by ? " I desperately needed someone talk to , so I agreed . But as soon as we were settled on the couch in the deserted waiting room , I blurt the whole horrible story . How Dave did n't really want me at the convention , my suspicions , my fears . Even as the words came out of my mouth , they sounded silly . I 'd never really had one tiny shred of evidence to prove that Dave was interested other women . By the time I finished , I was crying and crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good doctor did n't lecture me . Did n't tell me . " Oh , your Dave ? you do n't have to worry about him . " Instead he said , " Tell me , Marnie . Do you think anyone saw us come up to my office ? " I shrugged . " What if Dave had seen us ? " he continued . I was puzzled . " Why , he might have wondered why I was seeing But he would n't have worried . After all , he knows me .... " It was n't necessary for me to talk any more . Things suddenly became crystal clear . Driving back home , I thought about every suspicion I 'd had about Dave and how I 'd built them up in mind . The hours I 'd spent fee sorry for myself , furious at Dave . W was happening to me ? How cou'j stop this worrying about what Da was doing at the office ? It was then I thought of Jennie a her little first-grader 's question t ' morning . " Mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to her , I did practically nothing worry . Sure I kept the house . But continued on page  | had help . I had n't gotten involved in her school 's PTA , though I 'd gotten a dozen calls during the year . And when Dave suggested that I volunteer my nursing services at the Free Clinic in town , I told him I just could n't leave the children . That was n't true either , with Jennie in first grade and Todd and Allyson in nursery school half a day . I was just afraid to try my hand at nursing again . It had been so long , and I had had so little experience at it before Jennie was born . When I got back to the house , Mrs. Smith was waiting with the messages . Three from Dave in the city . He was concerned that I had n't gotten home yet . I took a deep breath and dialed the hotel number scrawled on the note pad . I asked for Dave 's room . His voice sounded wonderful . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . That voice both deep and gentle . But he sounded lonely ? so little-boy unsure of himself . " Marnie , " he said , " I know you probably have other plans for tomorrow . . . but I need you here . I do n't care what you wear . This paper is important . wo n't be the same without share it with me . Promise me drive in tomorrow and spend t night here . Get Mrs. Smith to with the kids . Okay ? " Okay ? It was as though a new life was beginning . All the had flowed out . I felt in touch Dave again . Even over the telephone . Next morning I put my hair those ten-minute rollers that had sitting on my dressing table u for months . Then I dug a cou loose-fitting dresses out of the c They did n't look too but I hoped my s face would make up for extra poundage . At breakfast , I told nie she could change report for school .

Once a week to start . When I got to the hetel . I called Dave 's room on house phone . " Sorry , no one registered in t-ad room , " the operator told me . " Check at the desk please . " My heart stopped . Was I going crazy all over again ? ' I walked over to the desk and said , " I 'm Mrs. Collins I was sure my husband was in room 342 , but the operator told me that room was unoccupied . " " Oh , yes , Mrs. Collins. - smiled the desk clerk . " Dr Collins moved to room 356 ? he wanted a room with a double bed .
