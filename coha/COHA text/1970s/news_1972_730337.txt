txt The miniskirt is in deep trouble in Kenya . President Kenyatta has condemned it . G. K. Kariithi , head of the civil service , has told government secretaries to drop their hemlines . And hooligans pretending to be patriots have taken to slashing minis in marketplaces . African authenticity buffs used to slash minis in Tanzania several years ago . In Malawi , minis have been banned for the past three years , although they now are permitted to tourists in resort areas . The miniskirt 's position is even more perilous in Uganda . There women are arrested for wearing it , following a government degree banning it as " an outrage to decency " and " injurious to public morals . " In fact , an 18-year-old schoolboy was recently arrested in Kampala for wearing shorts 81h inches above his knee . He pleaded he was dressed in his school uniform , a garment exempted by the decree . Authenticity ' campaign No question about it . East African is in the grip of a mini crisis . In the middle of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxi crisis ? one which triggered a major church-state confrontation over President Mobutu Sese-Seko 's " authenticity " campaign under which tribal long skirts have been encouraged . This policy ended the use of European Christian names in the former Belgian Congo . It saw the removal of statues commemorating colonial endeavor and sought to erase both the colonial past and the " alienated African mentality " it produced . The miniskirt crisis , in fact the whole question even of whether to dress , is regarded with amusement by African intellectuals here in Kenya ? probably the most laissez-faire of African states , economically and otherwise . The Nairobi University social commentator , Taban Lo Liyong , for instance , underlines that while African governments have banned the wearing of minis , they have not yet written legal requirements that people be dressed at all . Confusing pattern He notes , too , the confusing pattern of European attitudes . When they first arrived in Africa , the Europeans insisted that Africans must don clothes to shed their " savagery. " - Now ' European tourists shed clothes and swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena as mini bans , authenticity campaigns , and black consciousness movements are no mere joke . They involve attempts to define African culture , preserve African personality , and let --  Africans find their own identity as citizens of today 's world . Some programs , like the mini bans , take a negative approach in trying to halt the erosion of what program formulators regard as African cultural values . Condemning mini skirts , for instance , President Kenyatta linked them with the rise of prostitution . Neither a mini skirt nor prostitution is African , he said ; both are imports from the West . That this approach can preserve African culture is unlikely . The many minis on Nairobi streets today suggest that condemnation alone has little effect . Moreover , some contend prostitution stems as much from urbanization as from Western values . Amorphous concept In Mr. Liyong 's view , African culture , an amorphous concept , is simply the way Africans are living today . It is something naturally different from the distinct tribal cultures from which the African masses originally came . If bans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness campaigns do seem to have a positive role to play . The leaders of such movements regard them as a keystone for true nationhood , for meaningful economic and political power . Discussing Zaire 's authenticity campaign , President Mobutu recently said , " We no longer want the citizen of Zaire to feel caught between two cultures . We want him to feel at ease in his skin , freed from all complexes so that he can freely grasp all the attributes of the modern world , adopt them , assimilate them in harmony , and gently adapt them to his own culture . " In a sense , these campaigns represent the quest of Africans for an image of themselves that they can recognize with pride . Tangible problems of development meanwhile await solution . But a people 's concept of itself is not unimportant in determining the paths it follows . A great deal more is likely to be heard of mini bans and name changing as Africans reach for the roles they have dreamed of playing .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
