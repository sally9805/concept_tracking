What keeps the welfare rolls long ? One answer may be that Government programs and the tax system work to reduce the incentive for the deprived to take jobs , at least in areas where welfare benefits are high . That is the conclusion of an analysis of inner-city family income in Los Angeles by Economist Arthur ( " Curve " ) Laffer , who has popularized the theory that lower tax rates lead to increased business activity and therefore to higher tax revenues . <P> Laffer found that a family of four in which no one works receives $739.33 a month if it takes advantage of all available welfare benefits and other payments , such as food stamps and housing subsidies . If one member works , family earnings are not much higher , because taxes go up and payments go down . If the job holder has wages of $100 a month , the family has an additional $31.54 of spendable income . If he has wages of $500 , the extra income is only $65.77 . At $700 the added income dips slightly , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages are $1,000 , he adds a mere $167.98 to the family income . Although other economists have shown that changes in taxes and benefits have little effect on poor people 's motivation to work , Laffer argues that the system clearly provides scant incentive to get off welfare . <P> Laffer added up all the disincentives for the working poor . Employee Social Security taxes take 5.85% of wages ; up to 10% goes to state and federal income taxes . Aid to families with dependent children , which amounts to $423 a month for a nonworking family of four , is progressively reduced by 35 to 50 for each dollar of wages earned . The rent subsidy for a family with no one employed is $273 a month for a three-bedroom apartment in an elevator building . If a family member takes a job , the subsidy is gradually lowered , to $110 a month at an income of $1,000 . <P> Any family that earns more than $567 a month forfeits free medical care . Food stamps worth $48 a month are progressively reduced to zero at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from being an assault on the poor , a tax cut , along with some changes in benefit programs , would help lower-income groups .
