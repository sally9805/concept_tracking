THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FOR the last century or so , most governments have thought it wise to separate religion from politics , but in the last few years religious feeling has begun to seep in around the edges of the political realm again . There is a spiritual impulse abroad in the world which seems to recoil from what secular leaders of almost every political persuasion have wrought in our time . In South America , many young Catholic priests are in rebellion against repressive regimes , and have declared that Christ was a revolutionary . The Pope has counselled these activist priests to turn their attention back to purely spiritual matters , but his own election to the papacy has had important political repercussions in his native Poland , and he may shortly make a trip there to commemorate the martyrdom of Saint Stanislaus , who was put to death in 1079 on the order of King Boleslav II , the ruler at that time ; the present government , which already faces strong unofficial opposition from an alliance of the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worried by the symbolism of the occasion . Alexander Solzhenitsyn , who has little use for any existing government , has advised the Soviet rulers , in a lengthy open letter , to drop Communism and replace it with a system based on Christian principles . President Anwar Sadat of Egypt , a greatly admired figure on the world scene these days , traces the beginnings of his highly innovative style of statesmanship to a deep religious experience that he underwent while he was in jail in the nineteen-forties for opposing British colonial policies . Our own President Carter is a " born again " Christian and has engaged in missionary work . But the most spectacular intrusion of religion into the political realm has occurred in Iran , where , if Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini could have his way , God Himself would step in and run the country . " The actual authority to legislate belongs exclusively to God , " Khomeini has written . As for everyone else , he has explained , " There is no room for opinions or feelings in the system of Islamic government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people all follow the wish of God and His laws . " No one can tell at this point just what sort of government will emerge in Iran , but Khomeini 's speeches and writings already serve as reminders of why God was removed from politics in the first place . His most important qualities make Him dangerous in a political setting . God is in His nature perfect , but human political communities are in their nature imperfect , and efforts to raise them to the level of divine perfection invite violence . God and God 's laws are eternal , but change is the life and essence of politics , and attempts to halt change by imposing rigid and unchangeable codes can lead to stagnation and repression . God is invisible and ineffable , but political institutions must appear before the public in the full light of day , and political policies should be spelled out in clear language . Finally , God is a giver of absolute truth , but in a free society , at least , political truths , including the truths on which freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a democratic society owes a fundamental respect even to views with which he disagrees , and can not regard them simply as the opinions of the Devil . A democrat must hold to the faith propounded by Gotthold Lessing some two hundred years ago : " Let each man say what he deems truth , and let truth itself he commended unto God ! " The spiritual and the political may have been mingled with more promising ( although not yet conclusive ) results in another recent event  --  the Camp David summit meeting last year of President Carter , President Sadat , and Prime Minister Begin . On that occasion , the three leaders were said to have been spurred to greater efforts by religious conviction . And the decision to hold the summit at all , like President Sadat 's decision to go to Jerusalem in 1977 , thoroughly defied the normal rules and expectations of politics , and seemed to have required some sort of spiritual inspiration . Naturally , for each man the faith had to be of a different kind , inasmuch as Carter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Muslim . Given this diversity , a certain blurriness and lack of specificity were called for in every reference to God 's will in the televised ceremonies after Camp David . Any differences between the teachings of Christ , Moses , and Muhammad conveniently melted away for the occasion : politics had driven the three political leaders into ecumenism . Here there could be no question of absolutely binding heavenly edicts , or of hrutal punishments that would he meted out to those who disobeyed . The moral may he that when the divine being is invoked in temporal affairs three religions serve better than one . WE have these X-Ray Spex .

The Spex are black plastic eyeglass frames with cardboard lenses printed in a red-and-white spiral design ; each lens has a hole about the size of a moderately dilated pupil , and covering each hole is what looks like a bit of black-and-red feather .

Suddenly , surfaces dissolved . Things were not what they had seemed . Things were not even things .

J. In 1972 , the Messrs . Jacobs and Schoenfeld , who had been the attorneys for the Shuberts for sixteen years , took over what is known professionally as The Shubert Organization ( and is the owner of , among other theatres , the Winter Garden ) , and then they became known as The Shuberts . The purpose of the meeting last week  --  which we attended , with the permission of all the parties concerned  --  was to settle some questions about how to promote and publicize , and corral audiences for , " Zoot Suit , " which opened in Los Angeles last August , under the auspices of the Mark Taper Forum , with help from El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suit , " which has music and dancing , turned into a tremendous hit , moved from the Mark Taper Forum , holding seven hundred and fifty people , to the Aquarius , in Hollywood , holding twelve hundred , and was seen not only by conventional theatregoers but also by a large predominantly Hispanic audience , many of them going to the theatre for the first time in their lives . At The Shubert Organization offices , we had the pleasure of sitting with the following cast of characters : Gordon Davidson , forty-five , artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum . Tall , thin , sharp-featured , radiating confidence and energy . Phil Esparza , thirty , general manager of El Teatro Campesino and community-relations coordinator for " Zoot Suit . " Dark-complexioned , muscular , bearish , passionately idealistic , with a droopy mustache of the kind that is pasted on actors playing Mexican bandits in sombreros .

Gerald Schoenfeld , fifty-four , portly , bald , jolly-mannered , and practical , as well as skeptical in the classic attorney tradition . The California contingent wore conventional California-type colorful shirts , open at the collar , and slacks ; The Shuberts wore conventional New York-type business suits , white shirts , and neckties . Mr. Schoenfeld held up the start of the meeting by giving the visitors a quick , enthusiastic tour of The Shubert Organization offices , beginning with the waiting room , which contained a Steinway grand piano , two greatly overstuffed sofas upholstered in dazzlingly bright-blue leather , a well-worn Persian rug , and an ornate bookcase with the masks of Comedy and Tragedy carved on the top , and with , behind glass , costume sketches for old shows such as " Blossom Time " and " The Student Prince , " and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Memoirs of Napoleon , " by Mme. Junot ; and " Merrie Tales of Jacques Tournebroche , Vol . III . " SCHOENFELD ( proudly ) : J. J. Shubert was a great collector . I 'm not saying he was a great reader  --  but a great collector , yes . He was a great importer of objets d'art . He imported two carved bronze doors from Italy , for example . They 're so heavy that if he used both together they would sink through the floor . So he put one on his apartment , on the eleventh floor of the Sardi Building , where the Dramatists Guild has its headquarters . The other one is in the basement of the Cort . A lot of this stuff comes from the Shubert Archives . We have an ongoing program  --  with a real archivist  --  which we fund . This whole place used to be Lee 's own apartment . Bernie and I share the apartment . For my office , I have the bedroom . JACOBS ( dourly ) : I have the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Brecher look politely at the furniture . ) DAVIDSON : We do n't have much time . I 'm catching a plane back to the Coast tonight . I 'll be back here for the start of rehearsals . E SPARZ A : We 've got some ideas about communicating with a new audience , about getting the Hispanic community- involved . BRECHER : Phil and I have discovered a lot of excitement already about " Zoot Suit " among the high-school kids in Spanish Harlem . SCHOENFELD ( continuing the tour ) : Just one look . ( Opens door to a closet . ) See the closet ? Look at the size of it . ( Leads way into a huge bathroom , ) That was Lee Shubert 's barber chair . Look at the shower . Have you ever seen anything like it ? Ten needle-heads coming at you from four directions ? The Shuberts grew up in poverty , in Syracuse . They had a sister who died of malnutrition . So I guess they needed all this . BREC H ER : Cozy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's really hectic . ( Gives tight laugh . ) SCHOENFELD : We kept some of the original things . It 's all part of our program to restore the theatres . We 've already redone the Majestic , the Imperial , the Booth , the Lyceum , the Forrest in Philadelphia , the Shubert in Chicago . IVe own twenty-one and a half in all , the half being the Music Box , which we share with Irving Berlin . JAcous : Shall we ? ( Leads way to his office , containing an enormous desk , several chairs , a long conference table , and the fireplace , above which he has ninny photographs of his grandchildren . He sits down behind the desk . The others take chairs facing him . ) The search for a Hispanic play has been something going on since " The Wiz . " Look , the Hispanic minority in New York is one of the largest in the city . The theatre has to he open to everybody ! ( He looks at the others as though expecting their congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SCHOENFELD : I ca n't stay . I 've got people to see . ( He leaves . ) JACOBS ( leaning back in his chair , touching the fingertips of one 11177111 to the fingertips of the other and looking very solemn ) : There 's really a war between the Broadway theatre  --  which is often called the commercial theatre  --  and the non-profit theatre . Actually , the non-profit theatre is appropriating a lot of our material . Sixty to seventy per cent of the plays that they 're doing originate on Broadway . The rest of what they do is the classics , and maybe ten per cent is original work . DAVIDSON ( looking a little pained but giving a wry smile ) : Not anymore , Bernie . The non-profit theatre is the greatest source , the most fertile source , of material for Broadway these days . JACOBS ( to us ) : It 's Gordon 's story , but I 'll talk . ( Gives his approximation of a laugh . ) My first experience with Luis Valdez was at Princeton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an eclectic affair , intended to let all groups who cared about theatre meet and know each other . ( Gives fingertips a good workout . ) We met a lot of people we had never met before . I was impressed by Luis 's story . This farm worker who became a playwright . And then I heard that one of his plays was being presented at the Taper  --  this showcase for talent . DAVIDSON ( with a laugh ) : We do n't do a showcase , Bernie . We do productions . " Zoot Suit " was a production . JACOBS ( to : There came a point in time when Gordon started calling us . We have always had a great admiration for what Gordon does . For the West Coast , Gordon does a great job . ( A laugh of self-appreciation . ) ESPARZA : We had a wonderful nontraditional audience for the play . BRECHER : Zoot suits , you know , started in Harlem . The audience can FEBRUARY 19 , 1979 go beyond Hispanic . Black audiences will understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mythical character who speaks to everyone . I really feel it 's one of those turning-point plays . JACOBS ( to us ) : Last August , we went out to Los Angeles and saw the play . We had a meeting of minds that same night . Gordon came to New York ten days later with Luis . We shook hands on a deal . When we first saw the play , on the second preview night , we had no idea it would be a success . We had no way of measuring the dimensions of the play . But instinctively we felt it would be successful . DAVIDSON : We did n't want to do the play in New York under just any circumstances . We did n't want to be ripped off . JACOBS : " Ripped off " is not a nice word . DAVIDSON : What we are all concerned about is how to communicate this play to the people  --  to the regular audience and to the new audience . picons : Not to the exclusion of the old audience . In presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll all be disappointed if we do n't attract a new audience . We 're not just dealing with a hunch of white liberals . ( Pauses , clearly proud of the admission of self-disparagement . A gain , his face registers disappointment when nobody responds . ) This play far transcends those kinds of limitations . This play is not just about Chicanos . It 's about minority people . The Winter Garden has a capacity of fifteen hundred , which means five hundred fifty thousand people a year . I 'll he satisfied if fifty per cent of the audience is Hispanic or black . ESPARZA We 've been going out to the Hispanic communities here . They need an enormous amount of personal contact . There 's a great difference between the Hispanic and the black communities . Language . That 's why we need more personal contact . It takes a certain amount of investment . They feel , " Hey ! Show us something more than a token effort . " JACOBS ( trying to conceal alarm ) : You see , now we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a non-profit entity and a profit entity , you run into conflicts on how to spend money . The profit entity is much more prudent . DAVIDSON : No . There 's much more waste . You 're dead wrong . We operate on a much tighter basis . jAcons : The Shubert Organization has crossed over . We 're involved not THE NEW YORKER primarily to make a profit but to develop a new audience . DAVIDSON : And we want to put on a play . JACOBS : I say it 's my money . I decide . We have certain priorities . If you dissipate those areas , you 're robbing Peter to pay Paul . ESPARZA ; Why is n't it worth the investment ? Just those little things we can do for them that mean a lot to them ? We 're going to be getting a lot of help from them . JAcoBs : I do n't believe that at all , and I do n't accept that . BRECHER : We have to show our gratitude for the support we 're asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways . Giving them buttons . Posters . Having our actors take part in the community religious processions . Ads in Hispanic magazines . Things like that . JAcoBs : If I followed your lead , I would be spending a million dollars on this show , when this show is budgeted at seven hundred thousand dollars . BRECHER : We 're talking about all of seven thousand dollars . For a few little ads . DAVIDSON : I thought we set aside a certain sum fur community development . ESPARZA : You need something to show good will . JACOBS ( irritably ) : You 're asking us to do journal advertising . I do n't believe in it . People are in the habit of buying tickets when the event is upon us , not planning three or four weeks before , not- DAvnnsoN : In Los Angeles , they do plan in advance . They have the fear they wo n't he able to get in . You 've got to respect their opinions . They're- JACOBS : Excuse me For interrupting you . You find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgo advertising in the New York Times ? The whole history of shows is that the minority show attracts a minority audience . We 're trying to make it attractive to a mixed audience . SCHOENFELD ( who has just returned and is listening , still looking cheerful ) : Your degree of involvement does n't matter as much when it comes to marketing and promotion . BRECHER : The point is that a unique marketing effort is called for here . For example , the big " Zoot Suit " ad in New York appeared first in El Diario , before it appeared in the Sunday Times . ( Gives Jacobs a big smile . ) JACOBS ( reproachfully ) : The real problem here is we bought a packageDAVIDSON : But- talk . We bought a package that included a cadre of people you brought here . Now you say you ca n't do the job unless you get money for advertising in the little Hispanic magazines . We ca n't help it that you are profligate , and we are teaching you how not to be profligate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BRECHER : No ! JACOBS ( leaning back in his chair and pushing the fingertips against each other ) : I say you are profligate . But I will consider a budgetary analysis of what it will cost . You have to think about budgeting restraints , but I 'd be a fool if I said no to everything . I do n't want to take the chance . And be left behind at the railroad station . ESPARzA : The most important thing is we all share a belief in this play . DAviDsoN ( with satisfaction ) : And it 's the play that speaks loud and clear .
