For manic bombast and sheer tactlessness , none of the world 's leaders can compete with the big mouth of Uganda 's General Idi ( " Big Daddy " ) Amin Dada . Were it not for his dismal record as a capricious dictator-in addition to expelling 42,000 noncitizen Asians from Uganda , he has crippled the country 's economy in the 32 months since his successful coup-Big Daddy 's brand of verbal buckshot might be considered amusing . As it is , his off-the-cuff oratory mostly reflects his instability and ignorance . A sampling of the kind of rhetoric that has prompted President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia to call Amin " a madman " and " a buffoon " : <P> " Hitler was right about the Jews , because the Israelis are not working in the interests of the people of the world , and that is why they burned the Israelis alive with gas in the soil of Germany . " ( In a cable to U.N . Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim , September 1972 . ) " Some Asians in Uganda have been painting themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters . If anyone is found painting himself with black polish , disciplinary action will be taken against him . " ( In a speech in Brazzaville , August 1973 . ) " I am told that venereal disease is very high with you ... You had better go to the hospital to make yourselves very clean , or you will infect the whole population . I do n't want you spoiled by gonorrhea . " ( In an address to students of Kampala 's Makerere University , summer 1972 . ) <P> " I want to assure you that I love you very much , and if you had been a woman , I would have considered marrying you . " ( In a telegram to an old adversary , Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere , August 1972 . ) <P> Amin claims to admire the U.S. , yet he has gone out of his way to needle President Nixon and sent him a July 4th greeting wishing him a " speedy recovery " from Watergate . <P> Last week Big Daddy did it again . Learning that the President had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired the White House : " I should like to congratulate you for the nomination . However , I have reason to believe the organization that has nominated you merely wishes you to hear of the nomination so that you can recover from the Watergate affair . My reason for holding this view is that it is very discouraging for real peacemakers in the world to hear of your nomination ... I am led to the conclusion that your nominators were not serious in their choice . "
