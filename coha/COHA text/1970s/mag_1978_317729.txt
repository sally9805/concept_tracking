When he discovered that the Government expected to be paid about $35,000 in taxes on his winnings , he deposited his windfall in a bank on the island of Jersey in the English Channel . McNulty figured that money not brought into the U.S. could not be taxed by the IRS . <P> Not so , ruled a federal court in 1975 . It sentenced him to five years in prison for tax evasion . With time off for good behavior , McNulty , 67 , has served his sentence . But the IRS has filed a suit to collect its bill-now $70,000 because of additional penalties-and Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli has ordered McNulty to stay in jail until he complies . Says McNulty : " I 've held out for almost four years , and I 'll hold out until I see justice and freedom served .
