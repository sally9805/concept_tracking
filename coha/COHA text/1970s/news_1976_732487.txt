txt More jobs , more goods and services at less inflationary prices ? the prospects appear to await American consumers in the months ahead , as the U.S. economy lifts toward an all-time high in output . Not even the White House , which tends to put a rosy glow on economic forecasting this election year , had expected the economy to perform as well as it did during the first three months of 1976 . In three areas ? ability to create jobs , production of goods , and price stability ? the economy is surpassing earlier forecasts by most experts , in and out of government . Analysts from liberal Walter Heller to conservative Republicans agree that many voters tend to credit an incumbent president with good economic news . Thus President Ford 's nomination and election prospects appear to be enhanced by the latest economic statistics released by the U.S. Department of Commerce . In spite of the good economic news pegged during the first quarter of 1976 , there is a discordant note from the automotive industry . Analysts are predicting increases in car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . See Page 6 The nation 's gross national product ( GNP ) , or total output of goods and services , climbed at a 7.5 percent annual rate during the first quarter of this year , while prices ? measured in the broadest way ? rose only 3.7 percent // * U.S. economy does a surprising leap // " A 7.5 percent growth rate , " said Maynard Comiez , acting chief economist of the Department of Commerce , " is better than normal , but less than a lioom . " For the year as a whole , he added , economic growth " will be at least 6.5 percent , maybe somewhat more . " " Growth in the first four quarters since the trough of last year 's recession , " said the Commerce Department official , " has averaged 6.9 percent , " a slightly higher growth rate than in recoveries from earlier recessions . Now the United States , rebounding from its longest and deepest postwar recession , is only ' two-tenths of a percent below its 1973 peak output of goods and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States will shortly ? if it is not doing so now ? be producing more goods and services than at any time in its history . Experts note , however , that the U.S. population is 3.8 million higher than at the time of the 1973 peak output . Thus goods and services today have to be divided among more people than in the past . Also , the jobless rate in 1973 , when GNP achieved its last high . point , was 4:8 percent , compared with 7.5 percent today . Millions of Americans still are not sharing in the nation 's bounty , except through unemployment compensation and welfare . Steadily , however , the jobless rate has inched down from its 8.9 percent high point in May , 1975 . This trend , coupled with the fact that the nation 's work force is growing , means that more Americans today hold jobs than ever before . In March , according to the U.S. Department of Labor , a record 86.69 million Americans held jobs . The previous high was 86.29 million in July , 1973.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
