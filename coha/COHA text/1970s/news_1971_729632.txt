txt A brief two-paragraph dispatch on the inside pages of their newspapers Tuesday morning was all that the Russians read about the conclusion of a draft four-power agreement on West Berlin . But for all the terseness of the report , there is no doubt about the importance which the Soviet leaders attach to the agreement . They made concessions to get it because it was the immediate step needed in order to pursue their longer-range goal of securing a detente in Western Europe . " We were surprised that the Russians went as far as they did , " commented one Western diplomat . " It indicates they wanted it badly . " Once the Berlin accord has been signed , the next priority for the leadership will be ratification by Bonn of the Soviet-West German nonaggression treaty of August , 1970 , as well as the Polish-West German pact of November , 1970. // *Soviets nurture Berlin accord // Diplomatic opinion is that the Russians will push hard for ratification to make sure it comes before the West German elections in 1973 , reasoning they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willy Brandt in power than the would with a possible successor Also on the agenda is the pet Sovietconcept of a European conference , the desirability of which was reaffirmed by the Warsaw Pact states at their summit in the Crimea on Aug. 2 . Currently Hungarian President Pal Losonczi is in Finland , which has offered to host the parley , and is thought to be discussing this matter with Finnish leaders Change of stress Significantly , the Russians no longer refer to a " security " conference Perhaps realizing that a consideration of defense problems would entail too complex and long a process , they are stressing instead that such a conference would discuss ( 1 ) an agreement on nonuse of force , ( 2 ) cooperation in scientific , cultural , and environmental questions , and ( 3 ) formation of a permanent body on security and cooperation . What the Soviet Union hopes to achieve at an all-European gathering is not clear One motive is seen to be to obtain de facto international recognition of East Germany , which would participate , and an acknowledgement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries Concern over EEC growth Diplomats here also believe that the Soviets are motivated by apprehension over enlargement of the Common Market In the Soviet view , they reason , a more integrated Western Europe will become stronger economically and politically and will have an attractive pull on the countries of Eastern Europe . An all-European conference may thus be seen partly as a counterattraction to EEC integration Possibly the Russians may support the establishment of some standing organ in which Comecon , the East European economic grouping , and the Common Market and other nations could work out mutual arrangements . In any event , with the Berlin question now on track , the Russians are in a position to argue that the United States no longer has any basis for objection to a European conference . And in fact , say Western diplomats , it is hard to have any arguments against it . Troop-reduction balloon Meanwhile , Moscow last May also floated suggestions for talks on troop cuts in Europe . Diplomats seem to feel that while the Russians are anxious to cut back their heavy defense burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely vague about what they have in mind , possibly because they themselves do not know and want to see what concessions are available in the West After a meeting last June the NATO countries agreed to begin bilateral soundings with the Soviet Union and its allies as a preliminary step to negotiations on MBFR The next step was to be a meeting of deputy foreign ministers some time this fall at which a NATO representative would be appointed to conduct exploratory talks with Moscow As in the case of the European conference , the NATO communique indicated that Berlin was the key factor to talks on force reductions . Now that a draft agreement on the city has been hammered out . the way presumably is also clear for movement on the MBFR question . Diplomatic observers caution against an expectation of quick progress , however They note that while the Russians have been stepping gingerly down a road of detente there are factors which make the outcome of this policy unknown One , for instance , is the growing diplomatic activity of Communist China in the Balkans Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most significant developments since the end of World War II And it seems to hold out the promise of further accommodations on the continent of Europe .
