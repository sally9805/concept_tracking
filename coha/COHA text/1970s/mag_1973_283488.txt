A DOLL 'S HOUSE <P> Directed by PATRICK GARLAND Screenplay by CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON <P> The famous door-slamming exit that climaxes Ibsen 's once scandalous play about a bourgeois woman liberating herself from a claustrophobic marriage no longer shocks . The melodramatic blackmail plot in which she is ensnared for much of the time now seems a rather forced theatrical convention , not worthy of the playwright 's thesis or a modern audience 's interest . Its disclosure to her husband , which in turn exposes him as a hypocrite more concerned about his own status than his wife 's reputation , seems both simple-minded and rather too specifically linked to a time ( the late 19th century ) and a place ( gloomy Scandinavia ) to be relevant to the contemporary war of the sexes . <P> Christopher Hampton 's adaptation transcribes rather than transcends Ibsen 's antique dramaturgy , while Patrick Garland 's direction is curiously uninflected , so the whole enterprise gives off the air of a respectful college theatrical . As Nora Helmer , Claire Bloom seems to substitute aspiration for inspiration-a windup doll whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull domesticity in the early going , and who completely runs down in the final confrontation with her husband . As her antagonist , Anthony Hopkins acts more like a spoiled adolescent than an oppressor to reckon with . A quartet of worthy English actors-Sir Ralph Richardson , Dame Edith Evans , Anna Massey and Denholm Elliot - wander aimlessly around in the supporting roles . <P> In all , the interest in this production of A Doll 's House is mostly historical and comparative ( Jane Fonda stars in yet another film of the play that is scheduled to be released in the fall ) . One emerges from it suffused with a feeling of duty done , a debt paid to cultural history . It is a mood entirely indistinguishable from boredom . <P> ? Richard Schickel
