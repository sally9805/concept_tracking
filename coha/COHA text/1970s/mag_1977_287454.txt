New Challenges <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Your essay on the mood of the people Jan. 24 captured the fact that we are tired of being tired , sick of being sick . It is indeed possible for a culture to be old , mature and perhaps overrich with experience , and yet still eager to meet and master its new challenges . <P> <P> Leonard D. Sax Shaker Heights , Ohio <P> As an unemployed executive residing in the " no place to go but up " Middle Atlantic region , I could easily be dispirited . As a young widower raising five children , I could be further dispirited . However , I 've never been more optimistic in my entire life . I feel completely assured that President Jimmy Carter will provide the leadership , motivation and quiet enthusiasm that this nation so desperately needs . My five youngsters are doing just great . Quite soon I expect to be back on top of the heap where I belong . <P> <P> Robert J. Kiley Yorktown Heights , N. Y. <P> <P> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " hopeful-sort of . " The Americans you talked to all expressed hope that one man can lead us into better times . I hope people do not expect one man to lead us into a brighter future without " We the People . " <P> <P> Daniel Schuh Portland , Ore . <P> <P> My heart just bleeds for Radio Producer Hamilton Cloud , who at $12,000 a year complains that he can not afford to get married . I 'm 23 , a white B.U. graduate who earns less than $9,000 a year as an editorial assistant for a small magazine in Chicago . I am not only married but I am also supporting my husband through medical school . We too are still getting used to the idea that things will never be cheaper than they are now . <P> <P> Debbie Narrod Chicago <P> I am not surprised that you find America 's mood hopeful-sort of . A few years ago barbecued ribs were all the rage . Then we switched to a bitter diet of crow . Now that the indigestion has all but passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James E. Loomis Ashtabula , Ohio <P> <P> Those Georgians <P> Not since Sherman 's march through Georgia has there been such a day as the day those Georgians , named Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter , marched through Washington Jan. 31 . <P> <P> J. Ronald Pierce Savannah , Ga . <P> <P> In viewing the Inauguration ceremonies , I had a feeling of refreshment , of calmness mixed with exhilaration , of pride that our system of Government can not only endure , but also overcome even the most dolorous of times . <P> <P> Carmine C. Bonanni Margate , N.J. <P> <P> Perhaps Jimmy Carter should read history instead of the Bible . As Henry Clay put it in 1818 , all religions united with government are more or less inimical to liberty . All separated from government are compatible with liberty . The Inauguration was an insult to secular America . <P> <P> Madalyn Murray O'Hair American Atheist Center <P> Austin , Texas <P> It seems a shame that Inauguration Day is n't a national holiday . I would like to have my children home from school so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are home on Columbus Day , Washington 's Birthday , Lincoln 's Birthday , when the only thing they see is the sales in the department stores . Congress should rethink our entire national holiday setup . <P> <P> Carolyn M. Ambrose Westbury , N. Y. <P>
