txt Fresh snow has dusted the scotch and pitch pines of Chappaquiddick Island where the gray shingle cottage with the yellow shutters stands winterempty . It was from here last July 18 that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has said he drove off with Mary Jo Kopechne to catch the ferry to Edgartown . Her body , trapped in his car which plunged off a narrow bridge into a tidal pond , was found late the next morning . An inquest into her death starts here tomorrow . Cook-out Precedes Tragedy But persons associated with the cottage , talked about the fates that made it available that night to Kennedy and his guests for the cookout that preceded the tragedy . " People made an issue about the cottage being in such an out of the way place , " remarked Mrs. Foster Silva . , " They the Kennedy group had no choice . It was the only place available on the island . " Mrs. Silva is a real estate broker and rental agent . Her husband is the island 's volunteer fire chief . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer teems with tourists . Renting Policy Told Silva observed that you could " rent a chicken coop on this island in the summer . " Mrs. Silva recalls how the cottage normally was rented for the whole season ? and had been ' last year . Sidney K. Lawrence of Scarsdale , who owns the cottage , also talks wonderingly about fate . For the previous two years his boss  --  Lawrence is an attorney with the New York state labor department ? had taken the cottage for the mid-July week . In 1989 , he did not . But , said Lawrence in a telephone interview , it was rented to an east coast couple who wanted it for the month of July and had made a deposit . Move to %Vest Coast " Then they called and said he had been transferred to the west coast , " Lawrence recalled . " They were willing to do whatever necessary to get out of the agreement . " I 've talked to a lot of people about this . It somehow seemed fated . " Joseph Gorgon , cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to get the cottage for the period of July 12-20 . The small , two-bedroom dwelling rents for $200 a week . It apparently was used only once ? the night of the party which six girls and six men attended and where 10 spent the night because they thought they had missed the midnight ferry to Edgartown . Does n't Visit Bridge Silva also remembers how " something " the night of July 18 and early July 19 kept him away from the tidal pond and the bridge from which Kennedy 's car plunged . " Usually , I check down around the beach beyond the bridge sometimes as late as midnight or 1 a. m. , " said Silva . " But that night I drove to the bridge about 10 , planned to get up early to work on my boat down at the pond , and thought I had better get home and get to bed . " Kennedy has said he and Miss Kopechne left the party around 11:15 p. m . Nor did Silva returh early next morning to the pond where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly ' seen the vehicle under the water . Recalls Other Renters He remembered visitors renting houses nearby , he said . He thought It unfair to risk waking them . The Silva home Is separated from the Lawrence cottage by three wooded lots , two dirt roads , and a metal shed . Sounds from the Kennedy party bothered Silva 's dogs , who barked and awakened him that night . Silva has been extensively questioned about the evening by authorities , including an agent from the Federal Bureau of investigation .
