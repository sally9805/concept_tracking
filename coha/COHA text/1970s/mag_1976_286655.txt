English Professor Daniel Seltzer 's classroom antics have made him a character on the Princeton University campus ; during lectures , he suddenly breaks into near perfect imitations of Peter Lorre or John Gielgud or a Jewish mother . He can also transform his Shakespeare and modern drama classes into vibrant theater , effortlessly slipping into the role of King Lear , perhaps , or Uncle Vanya . But to the dismay of Seltzer 's students , their professor is saving his best dramatic efforts these days for enthusiastic audiences on Broadway . <P> Seltzer , 43 , is playing a starring role in Knock Knock , Jules Feiffer 's successful new play about two middle-aged men living in seclusion ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) . Last week Seltzer was nominated for a Tony award for his role as Cohn , a fussy , intellectual eccentric . When Seltzer read his part to some of his students before the play opened , they thought he was merely being himself . Says Katherine Mendeloff , a senior English major from Baltimore : " It 's so Seltzerian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Not really . While looking for someone to play the role of Cohn , Feiffer remembered seeing Seltzer in early 1975 in an off-off Broadway production of The Sea Gull . In August , he tracked down the professor , who was on a lecture tour in Africa , and signed him up . Seltzer insisted on one condition : that the play be put off until January , when he was scheduled to start a sabbatical . <P> Seltzer has been leading a double life ever since . Before leaving his Princeton home for Manhattan ( 50 miles away ) each day , he attends English department meetings and directs the university 's theater and dance program , which he initiated in 1974 . Unlike those of most universities , the program is not designed to train students to go directly on the stage after graduation . Explains Seltzer : " I am not interested in increasing the number of unemployed actors . I believe that a study of theater is the best way to expand minds and sharpen emotions . " Indeed only a small percentage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors . Says Seltzer : " We 're building creative audiences . " <P> Seltzer , the son of a New Jersey biochemist , is a Princeton graduate , class of 1954 . He switched to Harvard for his doctoral studies , then returned to Princeton in 1970 after twelve years of teaching English at Harvard . <P> His students hope that Knock Knock has a long run , but they miss having Seltzer at Princeton full time . For one thing , the bachelor professor now has little time to uphold his reputation as the best chef on campus . He has been forced to cut back on the Indian and Szechuan Chinese dinners he cooks for his students . But what students miss most are his classroom dramatics . Says Sophomore Chad Restum : " Dan can do a reading involving three characters and never make a mistake with the different voices . " The day when Seltzer is back performing at the podium may come none too soon for the acting professor . Says he : " I could sleep for a week . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
