txt SCHOOLS SUPT . James F. Redmond believes the low achievement levels of Chicago 's public school students " have bottomed out and are on the way up . " " Remember that we are comparing youngsters with different backgrounds and different cultural experiences which they have had and to which we have not yet learned to adapt , " he said . " We did n't get there in one generation , and it takes a generation or two to get back . " REDMOND SAID he was hopeful that an intensive program to coach teachers in better methods of teaching reading eventually will reverse the trend of low achievement . He also confessed that " the slowness in improvement of achievement is one of the things that worries me most . " Redmond , 58 , has been superintendent since 1966 , when he succeeded Ben Willis . Since then , Redmond 's administration has been plagued with severe money problems , teacher strikes , and abysmally low reading levels . REDMOND ALSO has had to deal with a strong-willed , often balky , school board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redmond . The lines in his face are deep , and his demeanor is weary . He chain-smoked his Way thru this interview , filling an ashtray with 10 cigaret butts in an hour . Yet he is seeking another four-year contract and is optimistic about the school system 's future . Here is the interview : Q  --  A Stanford University professor said recently that today 's educational leaders will be judged not on whether they were successful in permitting their institutions to grow and survive , but whether they allowed them to die with grace and dignity . Do you agree ? A  --  I personally believe that if there is any large city education institution that has a good opportunity for survival it is Chicago 's . The public school system is tied to the health of the business community and the life of the city . As I look around , there is no Pace that 's more alive than Chicago . Q  --  Each year , more white families // Supt. James F. Redmond ( above ) has been running Chicago 's schools since 1966 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this exclusive interview Redmond discusses education problems , including the report on low reading scores of students which was released Friday . move out to the suburbs because the schools are bad . Do you agree ? ? A  --  I would n't be so certain it 's tile schools . Everybody jumps on the schools . Do not occupational opportunities , neighborhood living conditions , and housing have an equally important role ? It 's awful easy to say schools , and I 'm sure that 's one of the points . Q  --  Will Chicago share the fate of other large cities , whose school systems are the province of blacks and Latins ? A  --  I really do n't believe it will . The move to outside the city appears to be leveling off , and I think that the moves by the business community to redevelopment of the inner city ? slow as they are  --  will help reverse the trend . Q  --  Why Is there such a difference between schools in lower income areas and schools in white neighborhoods . Take Brethren Lan overcrowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . Why does that happen ? A  --  Bradwells would n't happen if the change in the background of families in the neighborhoods did n't happen so rapidly . There are many other communities where the r a c i al composition has changed without such speed and we 've been able to keep up . And we 're criticized because we involve the community in decision-making . There is not a community that is identifiable from one sixmonth period to another . Decisions agreed upon by one community six months ago are not agreed upon later . Q  --  Do you feel isolated from what is going on in the schools because so much of your information comes from staff members ? A  --  When you put it that way ? surely . No longer is a school superintendent in a large city able to say that he knows how Teacher X is working with his or her staff or students at a particular school . But this is not a problem . The image of the superintendent as a supervisor of instruction is out-ofdate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business operation of a school system assumes so much of the administrator 's time that he could well be a business school graduate as well as a teachers college graduate . Q  --  Do you feel you 'd like to get out to the schools more often ? A  --  I would suppose that I do n't get into more than 10 schools a month . I would enjoy the opportunity of visiting more than that . Aside from the personal satisfaction of meeting and talking with people , I think it would be good if those people saw me more often . Q  --  In discussions that the School Board has had on your contract renewal , some board members have said they do n't believe you are " visible " enough . One example that was brought out was Gage ParkA  --  I refuse to comment on whatever the board has reported on my contract situation . Q  --  The Chicago School Board often Is criticized as slow-moving and ineffective . Members spend a lot of time bickering among themselves . What do you think about - the board ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By its nature , it calls for consideration of alternatives . I do not think the Chicago board is any different than any other board of education in this manner . I would be disappointed in a board that appeared to automatically approve and not consider decisions in depth . Q  --  Another criticism is that the board is crisis oriented . If people boycott . if they 're on television , they 're more apt to you would assume that the appointing authority would lead to appointment of those of a similar philosophy or background . That is irrefutable . In the actual day-to-day operation of the schools , I have yet to have it suggested that I do one thing or another . People do n't get their jobs and business is not awarded on that basis at all . Q  --  M r s . William Miter School Board member says administrators should go back to school to teach . Would you consider it ? A  --  That would be no problem for individuals , but there is still a need for continuity in the administrative process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the opportunity in high school social studies . ( I  --  If you had a school  --  age child , would you send him to a Chicago public school ? A  --  Most assuredly . We have with ours and would continue . My son Jim went to Jamieson and Peter son Elementary Schools when we lived in Chicago before I became superintendent . Q  --  There was a time when there was a shortage of teachers , and many of them opted for suburban schools because they did n't want to teach in inner-city schools . Are teachers more dedicated now ? A  --  Well , maybe it 's because the job market is a little tightor , but I really do n't believe that 's the basic cause . For the last 10 years , I have been aware of a feeling almost akin to the old Peace Corps attitude on the part of a substantial number of young folks who are preparing for teaching . They see the center city as the place where a difference can be made . What they need is specific training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your two terms as superintendent . Will this continue ? A  --  I 'm not a bit ashamed that we 've moved from $5,000 starting salaries to $10,000 . We are practically competitive with the professions that require the same kind of preparation . But I think we are thru catching up . I suppose as inflation continues , we will have to keep up , but big jumps in the salary schedule are a thing of the past . Q  --  What do you hope to accomplish in the next four years ? A  --  I can see three areas . One has to do with the training and retraining of teachers . The second is a continuous evaluation of elementary and secondary courses of study to assess students ' current needs . And third is the assessment of the role of the board of education in a large metropolitan area , a review of basic policy positions , and to continue to ref ine community involvement .
