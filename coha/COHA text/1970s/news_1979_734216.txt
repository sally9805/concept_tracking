txt THAT GREAT tabulator of death and maiming statistics , the National Safety Council ( NSCI , has a real puzzler on , its hands . NSC statisticians ca n't figure out why fewer people are dying from falling down . They think it should be otherwise . " In the last 15 years there has been a 43 per cent increase in the number of people over 75 , the ones who are most susceptible to accidental falls , " says Jack L. Recht of the NSC . Yet the number of annual deaths attributed to falls declined from 20,000 to 14,000 during these years . That , says Recht , " is an exceptional happening . " HE AND MS colleagues at the NSC center at 444 N. Michigan AV. are trying to find the reason the fall figures have declined . They have bad several theories : More older people . are living in ice-free climates ; there- are fewer houses with Column 1 stairs ; and fluoridation of water may , as some doctors believe , be giving people harder bones . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an answer to their fall question . The NSC may still be looking for the answer-to , the fall puzzle , but it has answers galore on how and ? why 1 in every 20 deaths is caused by an accident . For example , did you know that : /The worst national disaster was the Galveston , Tex. , tidal wave of Sept. 8 , 1900 , that killed 6,000 . The great Chicago fire of 1871 that you hear so many calamitous things about does n't even rank as a major disaster , at least to the NSC . ? Chemical workers at the E.I. du Confirmed on page 4 , cc 1 Getting in book is accident // Pont de Nemours &; Co. plant in Kinston , N.C. , once worked 66,645,399 hours without a disabling injury . It is a national safety record for industry . ? You can talk for 10 minutes about the need for safety , during which time two people will die in accidents , 200 will be disabled , and the costs will amount to $1.2 million . EACH YEAR facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facts . " The 1978 edition is 96 pages long Other facts about " Accident Facts " are that about 60,000 copies are printed each year , a copy costs $6 , and it 's not for sale at most newsstands . Expect to find it in the Library of Congress , in the Supreme Court building in Washington , in newpaper offices , and in the offices of congressmen and state legislators . They love to recite figures from it in speeches . Some Boy Scouts also have copies ; they must learn certain facts from " Accident Facts " to win a safety merit badge . When you hear the admonition " Do n't become a statistic , " the reference probably is to " Accident Facts . " THOUGH THE booklet can solve a lot of barroom arguments , it is vague on some things . Consider , for example , the old dispute about who are the better drivers , men or women ? " Accident Facts " says male drivers were involved In More than four times as many fatal accidents as women in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars that are " totaled , " men are the drivers about 2.2 times as often as women . Does that prove women are better drivers ? " Accident Facts " says only , " The difference in accident rates between the sexes is due at least partly to differences in the amount of driving done by the members of each sex , and to differences in the time , place , and eircu ? stances of driving . " ' TO GET THE most accurate statistics the Safety Council gathers data from state motor vehicle departments , insurance companies , local offices of vital statistics , and police departments . Care must be taken to make sure that what was a motor vehicle death is recorded as such , not as a natural death or some other kind of accident . Local agencies often will attempt to minimize the number of accidents that occur , pays Recht . " It is a very important political thing to do , " he says . " They want to show they had a better safety record than they really did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Accident Facts , " says some police departments refuse to classify auto deaths that occur on private property as motor vehicle fatalities . She said Detroit police once refused to classify as an auto death the case of a man who drove his car through the ice on the Detroit River . It was recorded as a drowning . " Accident Facts " does not attempt to tell motorists when , how , or where to drive . It lets the statistics speak for themselves . Auto deaths are lowest in January and February , when travel is light , and highest on the July 4 weekend . The worst time for fatal accidents is between 1 and 2 o'clock Sunday morning , a time when many motorists are returning home from Saturday night partying . Things improve dramatically as people arrive home . By 8 a.m . Sunday , a time when most people are home , fatal auto accidents reach their lowest level of the week . IN 1977 , THE states of New Mexico and Wyoming had the first and second highest auto death rates . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fodder for speeches by politicians , the Safety Council says it is used by some insurance companies in computing insurance premiums . Another user has been the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . It recently wanted to know what the probability of injury is from an object falling to Earth from outer space . " We were able to give them the figures they needed , " said Recht , In 1976 , the latest year for which figures are available , 1,060 persons were killed by falling objects of one form or another . THE MOST Important use of " Accident Facts " is to prevent accidents . In the 40-year history of the booklet the Safety Council believes it has made a significant contribution toward rEducing deaths and injuries from accidents . With some pride " Accident Facts " said in its latest edition : " Between 1912 and 1977 accidental deaths per 100,000 population were reduced 41 per cent from 82 to 48 . . . . The reduction in the overall rate during a period when the nation 's population more than doubled has resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed if the rate had not been reduced . " However , accidents still cause 100,000 deaths a year and are the fourth leading cause of death , behind heart disease , cancer , and strokes . Accidents are the leading cause of death of persons between the ages of 1 and 38 . THE LEADING cause of accident deaths is motor vehicle crashes . They account for nearly half the accident deaths and are a subject for which the National Safety Council is well known . Their annual forecasts of holiday death tolls on the highways are announced frequently over the Memorial Day , 4th of July , Labor Day , Thanksgiving , and Christmas and New Year 's holidays . At a time when radio and TV announcers have little else to report , they recite the " grlrn holiday death toll , " as they usually call it , and how close it is to the Safety Council forecast . It has given the Safety Council an image it would like to give up , a council spokesman said , adding : " We 'd much rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
