txt Apollo 15 will offer earth men a never-before-seen view of the moon ? a television spectacular of a miniature Grand Canyon , 10,000-foot mountains , and a miniature electric car that scoots astronauts over the rocky lunar surface . The landing site for the July 26 mission has been selected near a major mountain range called Hadley-Apennines . Close by will be Hadley Rine , a 60-mile long , 600-footdeep canyon that should set TV viewers on earth agaping . Story : Page 3 Apollo 15 promises both astronauts and TV viewers on earth a space spectacular : views of a miniature Grand Canyon of 10,000-foot mountains , and of " way out " scenery traversed by a compact runabout electric auto . The July mission will be to earlier moon shots as a visit to Yosemite or Yellowstone compared to the flatlands of middle America . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) considered five possible landing sites for Apollo 15 , scheduled for launch July 26 , all in an area called Hadley-Apennines , where a major mountain range of the moon rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rockies pushes skyward from the plains of Colorado . At the foot of the lunar mountains is a miniature Grand Canyon of the Moon  --  the Hadley Rille  --  a sinuous , 60-mile long , halfmile-wide , 600-foot-deep chasm that meanders through the mare material of the Palus Putredinus . The wide gorge almost parallels the margin of the Appenine Mountains , which rise more than 8,000 feet above the adjacent surface . Landing site chosen NASA had already narrowed the landing sites to two , 14 1/2 miles apart . Now they have just selected the northern site for Apollo 15 's mission . This site is about one mile east of a sharp bend in the Hadley Rille and about three miles north of the foothills of a 4,000-foot mountain block . A few more miles away , and clearly visible from the chosen landing site , is one of the largest mountains on the moon , 10,000-foot Mt . Hadley , surrounded by an army of lesser peaks . Astronauts James B. Irwin and David R. Scott will see the massif of Mt . Hadley dominating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Mt . Cook the Hermitage , New Zealand . Hadley , of course , is not snowcapped like its terrestrial counterparts . But it will appear brilliantly clear-cut , etched in sunlight against the jet black sky . Its sun-tipped peaks will pierce the lunar sky above the mountain 's own deep shadow of the lunar morning . As the astronauts leave the lunar module to walk on the lunar surface , the whole range of distant Appenines will be silhouetted against the morning sky . All the steep escarpments facing the astronauts will be in deep shadow surmounted by the hundreds of peaks , each traced by a silver lining of brilliant sunlight . Tricky piloting The site selection presents some tricky piloting problems for Astronauts Irwin ( lunar module pilot ) and Scott ( commander ) . They must guide the lunar module over the sharp , high-rising ridges of the Appenines for hundreds of miles , and then drop over the last precipitous escarpment to land within one mile of the rille . The tricky landing approach is comparable to descending into Denver when flying from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planners selected a 25-degree approach path , twice the angle of earlier Apollos . If Apollo 15 used the usual approach path it would clear the summit of a pass through the Apennines by only 3,000 feet . The steeper approach gives a 10,000-foot margin of safety . The high approach also gives the astronauts a better view of the landing site as they come in . They are supposed to land close to the rille , and close to the base of the large mountain mass at the south of the landing site , despite a profusion of fairly large , fresh-looking craters clumped beneath the mountains . Visibility important There would be other problems in trying to land at the usual low angle . The Apennines are high enough to cast shadows great distances across the plains , hiding the landing site . A high sun angle is needed to reduce these shadows . Yet the landing module must approach the landing site with the sun shining from beneath the module so that the astronauts can see shadows and pick out necessary landmarks . A sun angle of 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site in impenetrable shadow . But at a 25-degree approach the timing can be arranged for later in the lunar day , when the sun angle is high enough to move the shadows closer to the base of the Apennines . The landing site and vital landmarks are then bathed in sunlight during the final approach . There is an earth-end benefit from the high approach . It permits a greater launch window . Launches are possible on two days each month instead of one only . Apollo 15 can thus be launched up to 21/2 hours after 9:30 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 26 . But if a hold is needed the launching can be delayed to the following day . Geology of site interesting The site selected has many features of geological interest besides the Hadley Rille . These include the smooth , sparsely cratered mare Palus Putredinus , pre-mare light-colored plains-forming material , and the high-rugged flank of the Apennines . Scientists hope to find out how lunar mountain ranges were formed and how they are eroded . They know erosion takes place because Lunar Orbiter photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rolled clown the sides , and a profusion of boulders at the bottom of the chasm . Apollo 15 astronauts will be privileged users of the first automobile on the moon . Their electrically driven lunar roving vehicle will let them make several sight-seeing and scientific experiment-planting tours around the lunar countryside . A look at some craters After driving along the edge of the Hadley Rille , they will steer their lunar " dune buggy " across several miles at the base of the mountains and skirt around a jumbled field of fresh-looking craters a couple of miles southeast of the landing site . And to qualify for the world 's first interplanetary driver 's license they have been practicing on a replica of the lunar vehicle along the rim of the Rio Grande River Gorge . six miles west of Taos , N.M . In recent weeks . Astronauts Scott and Irwin and their backups , Richard Gordon and Harrison Schmitt , have worked in this rugged area of lava flows and desert mountains , the nearest terrestrial counterpart to Apollo 15 's landing site .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
