For more than a decade , young radicals have seized brief , Warholesque fame with bullhorns and sometimes with their bodies . Many of them have now disappeared into a reclusive existence at home or exile abroad . Consider : Mark Rudd underground with the Weatherman . Stokely Carmichael in self-imposed exile in Guinea . Fiery Berkeley Communist Bettina Aptheker in a house in San Jose to rear her child and write a book . Former S.D.S. President Carl Oglesby writing songs on a Vermont farm and lecturing at M.I.T. John Lewis , S.N.C.C. co-founder who once promised to sweep the civil rights movement " through the South the way Sherman did , " is directing voter education in the South . Mario Savio is established in Berkeley , the city he shook in 1964 and now wants to lead as mayor . <P> Among the radicals who once fleetingly held center stage is Anthony Tankersley , a former Berkeley graduate student convicted of the Sept. 1 , 1968 , terrorist bombing of a Pacific Gas &; Electric Co. high-tension tower . Tankersley , the son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community in Canada . For 18 months , Tankersley and his wife Susan re-examined their political philosophy . As a result , last February he turned himself in to federal authorities as his own " statement against violence " and is now serving a one-to five-year sentence in a California prison . From his cell , Tankersley talked to TIME 'S Chris Anderson about the making and unmaking of a violent revolutionary : <P> In 1966 Tony Tankersley was just beginning his graduate studies when he discovered political activism : " At first I mixed with a loose-knit group of Old Lefties and Black Panthers , but it did not take long for me to make the transition to the hip radical world-a world I could identify with . " His first encounter with the New Left came during the Oakland Induction Center riots of 1967 , when he " saw the brutality perpetrated against the demonstrators and thought it unjust . It was then that I began seeing myself as a violent revolutionary . " From a follower to a leader was a short step : he helped organize an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic flop . I felt impotent and very militant . I joined a commune ; I cut off ties with moderates , liberals , anyone who did n't agree with me totally . It 's so easy to resign yourself to violence as the only effective way to combat a system you conceive to be fascist . Once you 're committed to violence , you reinforce your own militance by shutting off all other viewpoints . You wo n't hear other people ; you ca n't hear other people . The ties you establish with fellow revolutionaries bind your mind to the ethic of violence . By the time fall rolled around , I was ready to take violent action . " <P> Tankersley dynamited the 60-ft. tower , then abandoned a cache of explosives just ahead of the police and made his way to Montreal . There , as a fugitive , he began to rethink his political role : " I was far enough away from the movement to reflect on my own actions without interruption . Nobody was there to remind me whom I could talk to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative ideas and found that I did n't know everything . I had been wasting all of my energy figuring out how to destroy , when I could have been getting something good and tangible accomplished . "
