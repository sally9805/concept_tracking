THE PHILANDERER by GEORGE BERNARD SHAW <P> Attending Manhattan 's Roundabout Theater is a little bit like rummaging in the attic of Grandmother 's house . The dramatic curios presented during the eleven years of this theater 's existence have sometimes been dusty , archaic , erratic and slight , but almost in variably fascinating . The Roundabout has developed a reputation for being the place to see plays that one would never get a chance to see otherwise . <P> The Philanderer is no exception . It is Shaw 's second play , and has apparently not been staged in New York for 62 years . If Shaw 's reputation depended on it , woe to Shaw , yet the play is an intriguing precursor of subsequent at tempts to foster equality between the sexes . Much of the action takes place in an implausibly gender-desegregated private club ( the year is 1893 ) called the Ibsen Club , in which women members pre-empt the smoking room and the rules require that men be not overly manly-unisex in embryo . Of course , Shaw foisted on Ibsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his quips on the subject have a prescient modernity . The piddling plot concerns a flirtatious chap ( Donald Madden ) who captures the hearts of two ladies ( Cara Duff-MacCormick and Marion Lines ) but cunningly evades the altar . The sturdy proficiency of all the players and of the director , Stephen Hollis , makes a raft of comedy out of a matchstick drama . <P> T.E.K.
