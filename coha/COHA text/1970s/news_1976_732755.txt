txt Muddy old river . Yellow in some spots . Dark brown in others . Bottom silt stirring when the rains come . Destroying homes and farms with your swollen water . They call her the " Muddy Mo , " this river that snakes its way through North Dakota . She used to be big trouble , uncontrollable and wild . Those who lived near her banks knew her unpredictability . Lester and Tillie Krein had seen the river change the course of many lives . They had seen the Missouri nourish the Dakota farmland and then envelop it with angry water . When the government decided to harness the river in 1046 by building the Garrison Dam , the Kreins helped tame this mighty body of water . They gave their youth to master the river , and now the river is getting even . Getting even through the government itself . Just like " Old Man River , " the Kreins have been told they must roll along . THEY ' HAVE been told they can not retire in the town the government built , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Missouri . " Now , after 30 years of helping to improve the quality of life for those who lived along the river , they must leave . Leave the white frame house in Riverdale , where they raised Twyla and Eldon . Leave the Community Church they 've attended for more than half a century . Leave behind their friends , memories , and giant sweetpeas and move on . In Riverdale , N.D. , the old must go . " It sort of leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth to know that you 've worked here for 30 years and then must get out , " said Krein . " I guess they want to fill up the town with young people to keep the town alive . I ca n't think of many other reasons for this policy . " When the Kreins moved to Riverdale , the town was a series of small wooden stakes jutting from the soil . It sprouted from the prairie like a Rower back in 1947 . It was a lovely and pleasant place . A showcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high school gymnasium was the best in the state . The teachers were the finest the government could find . There was no crime , except for an ' occasional contest to see who could get the most dents in their fenders by repeatedly hitting a stop sign before they toppled it . It was the Riverdale in the Archie mimic strip . The town , which zoomed - to a peak ' population of 4,139 in 1955 , boasted a chapel , theater , bowling alley , soda : fountain , post office , grocery , hardware store , hospital , cottonwoods , peonies , prairie dogs , wild clover , and two red and white checkered water towers . , It also had a Community church , ' which served 17 religious denominations , and an American Legion post , where the men could retreat for a few snorts . Each house had a garage and each backyard a permanent clothesline and a home fuel tank . There was a community swimming pool and garden area . EVERYONE WAITED for the 21/2-milelong , one-half-mile-wide , 210-feet-high dam filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lake it created . The result of the Garrison Dam , Lake Sakakawea , finally cut a 200-mile swath through the belly of North Dakota when the dam was completed in 1955 . No longer did Lester Krein have to drive to Montana for fishing . When the Man-made lake was born , Riverdale became a mecca for water sports , and a well-watered golf course was built . It was a government town . The government built the homei and still charges a minimal rent . The most expensive colonial-shaped , four-bedroom home in town rents for $337 a month . The townsfolk who lived on River-dale 's 11 semicircular streets were treated to " the life of Riley . " But there was a catch . No one could buy his home . The government ' owned the homes from 3d through 8th streets , where the engineers and work force lived . It even owned the homes on the other streets , where the high-ranking military retitled , The government took good care of everybody  --  or as everybody thought , EVERYBODY WAS young when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early ' 50s . Retirement was a long way off . Now that it has become a reality for people like the Kreins , their dreamlike existence has become a nightmare . " This town has become a home to our government employes  --  but it is a place where you ca n't set down roots , " said 0 . B. Taylor , public information official for the Army Corps of Engineers in Riverdale . " This is a government town and when you retire or get transferred , you leave . That 's the policy , as unfair as it may seem for lifers here . I 'm a lifer and I had to move to a nearby town and buy a home , when I realized I did n't want to leave the area . " The townsfolk tried to incorporate Riverdale , but the expense was unbelievable . Some people even went to Washington , D.C. , to get the rule changed , so people could buy their homes  --  but it was no use . " The government , like God , wprks in strange ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes after retirement , the government has retired their homes . Where once there were 650 units in town , there are now 167 homes . The government has literally folded up the streets and moved the homes out . Fourth through 8th Streets are practically vacant . All that remain are fire hydrants , street signs , and roadways patched with weeds . " Now that the dam is completed , only operation and maintenance personnel live here , " Taylor said . " The population has dwindled to M. Those who reached retirement age had to leave this little piece of perfection out in the middle of nowhere . " They 've never forgotten this place and a lot settled wherever they could nearby . It sure is a strange way to reward employes by asking them to leave the cleanest , neatest , best-tended town I know . " RIVERDALE STILL stands like a Ione sentinel surrounded by water and farmland . But the hospital is gone now . So is the theater . So is the hardware store and the drugstore . The high school gymnasium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school has been torn down . But the post office is still there and it is where Tillie Krein works . She maintains her position as postmistress of Riverdale in order to stay a little while longer , now that her husband has retired . " I remember thinking about the future back when we first came here , " she recalled . " We knew we could n't retire here , but who thought then that we would ever stay that long ? We have lived here so long , the town has become a part of us . " How can you leave , if you have to leave part of yourself behind ? It just does n't make sense . But we 've got to be realistic , so we 're looking for a home . I guess we 've got to go , "
