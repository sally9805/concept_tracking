txt The New York Public Library has reached a milestone of sorts . After holding out for several decades , it is reluctantly putting a few Harriet S. Adams books on its shelves . But in Charleston , W.Va. , where book banning is a lively issue these days , the library has n't any intention of introducing the Adams books . Moreover , many other public libraries continue to resist , and reviewers still shun the books as they have for half a century . Yet the books are neither Darwinian nor blue . And Mrs. Adams is n't to be pitied , for her books have sold in the millions , and her net worth is also un- - doubtedly in the millions . ragiNiiirttib If you 've never heard of Harriet Adams , perhaps her pen name of Carolyn Keene rings a bell . not , check with the nearest 10-year-old , and you 'll no doubt learn that Carolyn Keene is the author of the Nancy Drew mystery series . With her equally anonymous partner , Andrew E. Svenson , Mrs. Adams is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dana Girls , Hardy Boys and Tom Swift Jr. ? all juvenile series books the two authors write under various aliases . While the books have never won critical acclaim and while many libraries dismiss them as lacking literary quality , the series have been best sellers for decades . And do n't despair , children ; although Mrs. Adams is now 82 years old , Nancy Drew has n't cracked her last case . Indeed , Mrs. Adams has just completed the 52nd volume in the series , and she has already picked a title for the 53rd . The Changing-Tastes Mystery For mast publishers , juvenile series such as the Nancy Drew books went out with the 1940s  --  victims of television and the changing reading tastes of children . Two major publishers of such books have quit the business , and even Grosset &; Dunlap , the leader in the field , has scaled back its offering 's considerably . A decade ago , Grosset &; Dunlap was still turning out about 20 series , but now it 's only five major series , according to David Lande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The five series , it turns out , are the aforementioned works of the Adams-Svenson partnership , known as the Stratemeyer Syndicate because the operation was founded by Mrs. Adams ' father , Edward Stratemeyer , who was the original Carolyn Keene . Far from suffering the fate of other children 's series , the Stratemeyer books have shown ' steady sales increases since 1969 , and sales are currently at record levels . " We sell close to five million of the books a year , " Mr. Lande says . As a result , the books account for about 12% of Grosset &; Dunlap 's sales , he adds . They also account for perhaps 90% of the current juvenile-fiction series market . Sales of the books abroad have also been climbing and now account for about 20% of the Stratemeyer Syndicate 's income . Mrs. Adams boasts that Alice Roy , as Nancy Drew is known in France , is the best-selling juvenile series there . Origin of the Species For all its success , the Stratemeyer Syndicate , tucked away in cubbyhole quarters on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost as thinly staffed as when it was started in 1910 by Mrs. Adams ' father . Edward Stratemeyer , who produced series books under more than 60 pseudonyms , was responsible for such fiction heroes as Bomba the Jungle Boy , the Rover Boys , Tom Swift , the Bobbsey Twins and the Hardy Boys . To keep pumping out the books , he relied heavily on ghost-writers , many of them newspapermen , who would flesh out the stories from outlines of three pages or so . When Mr. Stratemeyer died in 1930 , the syndicate was taken over by Mrs. Adams and another daughter , Edna C. Squier . Mrs. Squier remained a mostly inactive partner until her death early last year . Mrs. Adams , on the other hand , assumed the role of Carolyn Keene , the name adopted by her father in creating the first three Nancy Drew books , led by " The Secret of the Old Clock . " Mr. Svenson , a former New Jersey newspaperman , joined the syndicate as a writer and editor in 1948 and became a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the syndicate 's full-time staff : Nancy Axelrad , an editor and writer ; Lorry Rickle , office manager and Mrs. Adams ' personal secretary , and Lilo Wuenn , Mr. Svenson 's assistant . Despite its small size , the syndicate continues to add prolifically to the more than 1,200 books it has already produced ( with a few failures scattered in with the successes ) . This year 's working schedule , for example , calls for at least nine and possibly a dozen . It will include , among others , new Nancy Drew , Hardy Boys and Bobbsey Twins- stories , two more books in a new motor-racing series , and several revisions of early Nancy Drew books . Mrs. Adams herself , having just finished the 62nd Nancy Drew book , has embarked on a Dana Girls book , also written under the Carolyn Keene pseudonym . Critics question whether the series books have much literary merit . They charge that the books historically have lacked character development and writing style and have constantly relied on stock plots . " Nancy Drew books are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mary Jane Anderson , executive secretary of the American Library Association 's children 's services division . Because successive books in each series are so similar , reviewing services tend to pass them by . " It 's silly to bother reviewing them . People know what they are , " says Sada Fretz , juvenile editor of The Kirkus Reviews , a service relied upon by numerous libraries in their selection of books . A Dissenting Voice Mrs. Adams , not surprisingly , takes exception to the critics . " My impression is they have n't read any of the books for a long time , " she says . No longer are villains swarthy foreigners , and dialects have been dropped from characters ' language . Many of the early books in the series , too , have either been rewritten or revised . Some of the Bobbsey Twins stories , which first appeared in 1904 , have been so changed that only the original titles remain intact . Mrs. Adams also argues that the Straterieyer books have educational value . " We go to a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For " The Secret of the Forgotten City , " the just-published Nancy Drew mystery , Mrs. Adams was in the Nevada desert last May , gathering information for the " sugar-coated " lesson in archeology woven into the book . Both Mrs. Adams and Mr. Svenson have traveled extensively to research foreign themes for the books . " In the old books you could get away with murder , but not today , " says Mr. Svenson , current creator of the Hardy Boys books and others . When youngsters finish one of the stories , he says , " I guarantee they know more than when they started . " Keeping the Facts Straight Besides striving for authenticity , the Stratemeyer Syndicate is also meticulous about its fictional " facts . " Nearly every person , place , date or ' significant event that occurs in its books is filed on index cards to avoid discrepancies in the books . Different cards , for example , keep track of organizations to which Nancy Drew belongs , prizes she has won , even doctors she has consulted . Others contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , location of the airport and the name of the local taxi driver . Mr. Svenson concedes that the series books follow a precise pattern designed to catch a young reader 's interest and hold it . " The trick in writing children 's books is to set up danger , mystery and excitement on page one , " he says . " Force the kid to turn the page . I 've written page one as many as 20 times . Then in the middle of each chapter there 's a dramatic point of excitement , and at chapter 's end , a cliff-hanger . " There 's little question as to how each tale will turn out , though . " The bad guys always get their comeuppance , " says Mr. Svenson . " Truth wins out over deceit . " Events have a way of following a familiar pattern as well . Arthur Prager , a critic and essayist , says of Nancy Drew 's many adventures : " Again and again , just as she sees an important clue , and reaches for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blunt instrument . There are more than 30 occasions on which Nancy is bludgeoned into unconsciousness by blows on the head , enough to reduce her to a lifetime of hanging around Stillman 's Gym looking for odd jobs . " She took off her shoes . As soon as the music started , she found it easy to execute simple movements , then with increasing confidence , more complicated ones . Some of the professional dancers came on stage and applauded . " Nancy Drew books nowadays arc all written by Mrs. Adams . She writes 60-page outlines in pencil , then dictates each book from the outline . Final editing is done by Mrs. Adams and others in the office . " The quickest I ever did a book was two weeks , " she says . " I like two months better , and that 's two months of solid work . " Much of her work is done at the syndicate 's small office . But Mrs. Adams , a widow with three grown children , also writes at her comfortable but modest home in Maplewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.J. , where she spends weekends . Andrew Svenson , Otherwise Known as ? . . Mrs. Adams also wrote a recent Bobbsey Twins book , but many others in that and other Stratemeyer series have been written by Mr. Svenson . The 64-year-old former newspaperman , who usually works out at his split-level home in West Caldwell , N.J. , has written under the names Alan Stone ( Tolliver series ) , Dan Scott ( Bret King series ) , Helen Louise Thorndike ( Honey Bunch and Norman series ) , Jerry West ( Happy Hollister series done for Doubleday ) , Laura Lee Hope ( Bobbsey Twins ) and Franklin W. Dixon ( Hardy Boys ) . And Now Wynn and Lonny Most of these names are Stratemeyer " house names , " used also by Mrs. Adams and others over the years . Though the syndicate still enlists the aid of free-lance ghostwriters , Mrs. Adams insists it is far less of a practice than in the past . " We have people on the outside that help in a pinch , " she says . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor-racing series just introduced , Mr. Svenson is doing the plot outlines and editing , and racing driver Sylvia Wilkinson is supplying the racing material . The syndicate 's success , however , has been due mostly to the durability of its early series . More than 60 million copies of Nancy Drew books have been sold to date . The Hardy Boys have had sales of 50 million copies , while the Bobbsey Twins have sold more than 30 million . One theory to which Mrs. Adams subscribes is that the books are sold heavily to nostalgic parents and grandparents who read them when they were young . " Mothers love the Nancy Drew books and give them to their daughters , " says Mrs Adams . The hardcover volumes , which Grosset &; Dunlap has repackaged with new artwork to keep them modern looking , have also been kept relatively inexpensive to help sales volume . " We did n't have a price increase for six years until we went to $1.75 from $1.50 on June 1 , " says Grosset &; Dunlap 's Mr. Londe . Though librarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough libraries are buying them these days to encourage Grosset &; Dunlap to put out Nancy Drew mysteries in clothbound , reinforced editions to withstand the wear and tear of repeated borrowings . " My guess is you 'll find them in well over half of the libraries in the country , " says Miss Anderson of the American Library Association . Controversy Continues The idea of giving shelf space to the series books is still controversial among librarians , however . " You would be amazed at how much heat you can generate by bringing up Nancy Drew , " says Jan Freeman , young adult coordinator for the King County Library System in Oregon . Many librarians still feel the books lack the literary quality that they should be serving up to children . But other librarians believe the books can serve as bait to lure youngsters into the library for the first time and at least get them interested in reading . " They feel the first goal is to turn children on to reading , and they believe you do n't do that by sayilig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not a very good book ' , " says Miss Anderson of the American Library Association . " They feel you should provide that book and more . " Of Birds and Ballet In a typical Nancy Drew book , " The Double Jinx Mystery , " the perennially 18-year-old amateur detective saves the owner of a rare-bird farm from a ruthless takeover by an apartment developer . Instead of a blow on the head this time . she is mowed down in a supermarket by a fast-moving cart pushed by one of the mysterious strangers who populate the Nancy Drew books . The narrative continues : " Oh , she cried out in pain ! " Nancy looked up to see who was responsible but no one was in sight . She was sure that someone had deliberately tried to injure her ! " But with the aid of her friends ( one of Whom invariably exclaims " Hypera ! " when excited ) and her faithful boyfriend Ned , Nancy unravels the mystery . In the course of this , Nancy and the reader learn a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another art  --  this time ballet . She admits she knows little about ballet , but gives it a try : " Nancy was flushed with excitement .
