Banking activities rarely make gripping theater , but current events at New York 's Franklin National Bank are a striking exception . All last week the bank staged a drama of conflict among officers , mystery about how it happened to suffer heavy losses in foreign-currency trading , and suspense about just how big the losses were . Though the bank 's depositors seemed safe , the performance was a shocker . <P> It began thunderously . Franklin New York Corp. , the holding company for the nation 's 20th largest commercial bank ( assets : nearly $5 billion ) , announced that it would skip its quarterly dividend because earnings in the first quarter had plunged 83% from a year earlier , to a sickly 2 a share . It was believed to be the first time that a major bank had passed a dividend since the Depression . The Federal Reserve Board felt called upon to make two highly unusual announcements : that the Comptroller of the Currency had guaranteed that the bank was " solvent , " and that the board stood ready to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first was blamed largely on losses in bond trading-not unusual at a time of slumping bond prices . But then Chairman Harold V. Gleason disclosed that Franklin also had lost $14 million in foreign-currency trading since March 31-later it was revealed that other losses were incurred before that date-and that the total loss could climb to $39 million by the time all trading contracts are fulfilled . He blamed the losses on unauthorized trades made by an unnamed employee who , he said , had been fired . <P> To competing bankers , the statement raised more questions than it answered . To incur losses that huge , they said , the employee would have had to risk approximately $250 million in currency trades , and at most banks no one could position such immense sums without having his activities come quickly to the attention of supervisors . The Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation of another puzzling matter : that 9,500 shares of stock were purchased by about 65 bank employees just before the dividend was passed . <P> A management upheaval promptly followed Gleason 's disclosures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago from Bankers Trust , was let go ( Gleason took over his job ) . <P> H. Erich Heinemann , vice president for corporate planning , who called the chairman 's statement about the currency-trading losses inaccurate-he did not say in what respect-was fired . Peter Shaddick , head of the foreign-exchange department , resigned , as did the law firm of Kaye , Scholer , Fierman , Hayes &; Handler , attorneys for Franklin National since the 1940s . <P> At the request of Franklin 's directors , the SEC suspended all trading in Franklin stock until after Memorial Day , giving the bank time to sort out its management and possibly to revise its financial statements . Franklin announced plans to raise money by selling $50 million of new stock to present shareholders , and Michele Sindona , an Italian financier who bought 21% of Franklin 's stock for $40 million in 1972 , offered to buy any of the new shares that could not be sold to others .                   @ @
