AS they surveyed the state of the U.S. economy last week , Americans felt bewilderment , frustration and occasionally a touch of fatalism . Mike Lynn , a Detroit barber , put it bluntly : " I do n't think about the economy . There 's nothing any of us can do to change things . " Occasionally the Administration seemed to take the same line - or argued that enough had already been done and that things would change gradually for the better . Only lately have Nixon and his economic advisers become somewhat more receptive to calls for stronger action ( see BUSINESS ) . The latest figures last week showed that unemployment had risen once again and that inflation was continuing . With an assist from the Nixon Administration , a steel strike was averted at the last moment , but inevitably at an inflationary cost . Within 24 hours after the wage settlement was announced , most of the big steel producers posted a price hike . After 18 disruptive days , the nationwide rail strike was brought to an end . Though many featherbedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted a 42% pay increase spread out over 42 months . <P> The President brought joy to Burbank , Calif. , home of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. , when the Senate by a vote of 49-48 approved an Administration-backed $250 million federal loan to the ailing company . That saved an estimated 60,000 jobs in the depressed aerospace industry . Before the week was out , lines formed again in Burbank restaurants ; banks reported a brisk business in traveler 's checks . But in another aerospace center . Seattle , the gloom only deepened when the Nixon Administration refused to distribute surplus food commodities in the city because it already had a food-stamp program in operation .

In contrast to Burbank , there is no relief in sight . <P> Blaming the System . So far , in varied sections of the U.S. , the state of the economy does not seem to pose a fatal political threat to Nixon-yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that many people see Nixon as having inherited the mess from the Democrats . After a tour of southern Illinois . Norton Kay , a former Chicago political editor , reported that the President is " seldom blamed or mentioned . People talk about government as an abstraction rather than about Nixon as a person . They seem disillusioned with the System rather than with a party or an individual . " Republicans hope that people are distracted by other matters . " They want to talk about the ball scores and their fishing trips , " observed Republican Senator William Saxbe about the mood of Ohio recently . " If there 's a recession , you would n't know it . " Such easy comfort is not usually echoed among White House advisers . Last week President Nixon , on his way to a weekend in Maine , stopped off in New Hampshire for a little political consciousness raising and cheerleading way ahead of that state 's primary . <P> Part of the economic blues was expressed in cynicism . Gail Gabrielson , an Inglewood , Calif. , car-rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher for three years , put it this way : " You bomb to death with the
