AIRBORNE <P> by WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR . <P> 252 pages . Macmillan . $12.95 . <P> On the evidence of William F. Buckley Jr . ' s account of his life afloat , it can be categorically stated that the author neither now nor ever has believed that the earth is flat . <P> In the summer of 1975 , Buckley , his son , sister-in-law , assorted friends and paid hands sailed to Spain aboard Buckley 's 60-ft. cutter Cyrano . Ashore , ships of state were foundering and inflation was making even rubber ducks a luxury item . Buckley 's landlubbing wife Pat was waiting apprehensively ( " If he comes through this alive , I 'll kill him " ) . But with Europe finally visible to port and Africa looming to starboard , Buckley brought his crew content past changeless Gibraltar . <P> So ended what had come to be known as " the Big One , " the cruise that Buckley had dreamed of for years . He has spent much of his life in or around boats . His first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isolation , in honor of his father 's political views . Much later there were ocean-going yachts bearing such names as The Panic ( in honor of the Great Depression ? ) and Suzy Wong ( in honor of the world 's oldest laissez-faire enterprise ? ) . Cyrano , in fact , might have been named Loophole . Buckley charters the boat for much of the year , making him eligible for depreciation allowances on it , deductible expenses , etc . He alludes to such arrangements but spares the details . The reader is envious enough . <P> Airborne is both an immensely pleasurable , digressionary account of an Atlantic crossing and an unashamed celebration of the good life in anything but the best of times . ( One of the crew aboard Cyrano even had to leave the idyl to attend the dissolution of his failed business . ) About himself and his class of sailing friends , Buckley writes : " We never fancied ourselves as ' everlasting children of the mysterious sea . Rather as a different generation of ' successors , ' anticipated by Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <P> Beards at Sea . Which means that Buckley can be counted on to temper the traditions of the sea with modern irony . The book is full of the renowned Buckley wit . On beards at sea : " Arriving in Bermuda unshaved at the end of the ocean race always struck me a little like the athlete on campus who wears his sweatshirt inverted , ostensibly to disguise the varsity letter-which , of course , accentuates that which it purports to cover : like men 's bikinis . " On beards in general : " Men tend to look the same . I have always shuddered at the possibility that , by mistake , St. Peter admitted Karl Marx and barred Johannes Brahms . " At times the ironies seem to have been guided by an unseen hand . In his off-watch time , Buckley read Moby Dick . But no whales were sighted , just an unidentified submarine . Buckley also tells of anchoring in an isolated cove in the British Virgin Islands , only to be unexpectedly joined minutes later by another boat bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences fade to reveal indelible tax brackets .
