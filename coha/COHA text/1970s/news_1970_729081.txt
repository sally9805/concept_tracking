txt It 's one of the American Government 's best-advertised failures-1.1 million " illegal " highway billboards . Now it 's being reconsidered by one of Washington 's least-advertised institutions  --  a group of 13 congressmen meeting quietly behind the closed doors of a reception room at the very rear of the Capitol . This temporary conference committee , made up of seven senators and six representatives , is struggling to reconcile two versions of a bill so different it 's hard to believe they were enacted just across the Rotunda from each other . The Senate ambitiously voted to ban virtually all billboards from federally aided highways . The House of Representatives chose merely to form a commission to study the issue for a year . The fate of the billboards should be known early next week . The conferees ' decision still must be ratified by both houses , but these recommendations are rarely rejected . Those billboards , you may remember , were ordered by Congress five years ago to be removed by last July 1 . As any motorist can attest , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last legs . They owe their new insecurity to a combination of federal commitment , notably from Transportation Secretary John A. Volpe , and outside pressure ? from the environmental movement and a private citizen named Douglas T. Snarr . " I have a positive feeling about the way this is all going to turn out , " reflected Mr. Snarr , relaxing after months of tireless lobbying since leaving Salt Lake City , . Utah , to encamp in Washington . Mr. Snarr is the unlikely catalyst in the antibillboard operation . At age 35 , he owns 1,300 signs worth more than $3 million in 13 Western states . He admires a good billboard with the eye of a professionally trained artist ( which he is ) and preaches the assets of outdoor advertising with the fervor of a Mormon missionary ( which he was ) . // Remember the , billboard ban ? ( It was 1965 ) // But right now nothing would make him happier than to see every highway billboard torn from the landscape . " I 'm no do-gooder and I 'm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to pay him " just compensation " ( the term in the Senate bill ) for his signs . That would let him salvage perhaps half of his deteriorating $3 million investment . But Mr. Snarr  --  who clings to a homespun faith in his government  --  also wants something more . He wants the government to obey its own five-year-old law . " I 'm working entirely through the system , " he explains , " because I think the system still works . " The system has n't worked yet , however . on the billboard issue . The sweeping Highway Beautification Act of 1965 ? nicknamed " Lady Bird 's bill " because of Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson 's interest in it ? has removed only a few hundred billboards in one state ( Iowa ) . It was simply starved to death by lack of funds . Law backfired so far The law has actually backfired , producing , instead of beautification , more ugliness . Existing billboards fade , peel , and totter without . proper maintenance as sign companies founder in financial uncertainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford the gamble , buy up signs and even erect new ones . National Advertising Company , for example , has significantly expanded its sign holdings since 1965 . The firm is wholly owned by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company , a conglomerate that markets night-glowing Scotchlite used on most American billboards and roadsigns. 3M ? the chief probillboard lobbyist ? argues that the signs serve the public and that banning them ( particularly in urban areas , where most of its signs stand ) would mean economic ruin . The company gets listened to . National Advertising 's headquarters in Argo , Ill. , happens to lie in the district of Rep. John C. Kluczynski , chairman of the House subcommittee on roads and a conferee on the pending bill . Mr. Snarr , however , found allies in the White House , the Senate Public Works Committee , and Secretary Volpe . The secretary has flooded key congressmen with supportive data , and huddled for hours with them privately . Conflicts summarized Chief conflicting provisions of the two bills : ? Money . Both authorize a generous $27 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate would tap the politically-sensitive Highway Trust Fund , a repository of gasoline taxes hitherto jealously reserved for roadbuilding . ? Action . The Senate would compel states to remove signs visible from highways ( the 1965 law covered only signs within 660 feet ) by withholding 5 percent of highway aid in the first year and 1 percent thereafter . The House would create a " Commission on Highway Beautification " to study the situation for the President for one year . If a strong compromise prevails , billboards may begin falling promptly . Several states are geared to begin " as soon as funds are available , " according to Secretary Volpe . A weak compromise , however , may invite a presidential veto . The President could kill the bill without depriving states of their coveted interstate-highway funds , covered by separate legislation . The administration may see brighter prospects for billboard removal in the next Congress . The House Public Works Committee will soon lose two powerful opponents of such legislation : Chairman George H. Fallon of Maryland and ranking Republican William C. Cramer of Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .
