txt The Consolidated Edison Company asked the State Public Service Commission yesterday for the largest electric rate increase in the commission 's history ? a 21.7 percent rise . It would add $4 to $5 a month to the utility bills of most city residents and give Con Edison $456-million in additional revenue . The utility estimated that a New Yorker who now used 250 kilowatt-hours a month and paid $22.44 would pay $27.41 for the same service in 1976 . In Westchester County , where most residential customers use twice as much electricity and now pay $40.98 a month , the bill would go to $49.78 in 1976 . The proposed increase includes provision for a summer surcharge that would cost the same New Yorker 50 cents a month and his Westchester counterpart $1 , for bills between May 15 and.Oct. 15 . The surcharge , Con Edison said , " is designed to recover extra costs of providing service during the peak summer demand period . " Con Edison serves about nine million people . Regret Voiced The request comes less than five months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in electricity rates , a rise designed to bring the company more than $300-million in additional revenues each year . Yesterday 's request was outlined by Charles F. Luce , the Con Edison chairman , in a news conference at the company 's headquarters at 4 Irving Place . " We regret that we must file this request at a time when our customers are fighting twin battles against inflation and recession , " Mr. Luce said , " but to defer it would result in a progressive deterioration of electric service and reliability in New York City and Westchester . " Mr. Luce conceded that approval of the proposed increase would mean " the customer is going to get hurt , " but said that in its rate application Con Edison sought the creation of an " energy stamp program " that would enable low-income customers to obtain a subsidy for their energy consumption . The subsidy would be administered through the Federal Food Stamp program . " We ? know that our rates are already the highest in the nation , " Mr. Luce said . The requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs Commissioner , Mrs. Elinor C. Guggenheimer , who called it " a direct threat to the economic well-being of New York City " and " an insult to all of the people who have been desperately trying to fight inflation . " " Before Con Edison is permitted to increase the staggering economic burden already on the shoulders of low- and middle-income consumers , " she said , " it must itself bear the burden of proof and account for every cent of the money it is currently receiving . Mrs. Guggenheimer also rec ommended that Governor Carey appoint a second consum er representative to the . P.S.C. before ? the commission ruled on the proposed increase . Last week , the Governor nominated Edward Berlin , who has represented consumer group , to the P.S.C. " Time and time again we have watched the P.S.C. rubber-stamp utility requests for rate increases , " Mrs. Guggenheimer said . " We have reached the point where the stamp pads must be replaced with powerful microscopes so that all details of Con Ed 's operation can be carefully studied . " Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate rise " an appalling prospect " that would increase the city 's annual electric bill from a projected $110-million to $135-million . " We can not understand why Con Ed is seeking a major increase less than a week after enactment of Federal tax legislation that provides new and substantial investment tax benefits for utilities , " Mr. Beame said . Comment Withheld In Albany , Alfred E. Kahn , chairman of the P.S.C. , said he could not comment on the details of Con Edison 's proposals in view of his role " as a final judge in the case . " He did say there were two elements in this case that made it different from past Con Edison proceedings . First , he said , the P.S.C. is preparing to issue an opinion , probably within two weeks , that would revise the utility 's rate structure and " make charges more responsive to relative costs . " He would not elaborate , but it is believed that the decision could cause residential electricity rates to climb more slowly . Mr. Kahn also said that the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations of Consolidated Edison " that might " point the way to improving Con Ed 's net income through improved efficiency . " The utility asked for the increase in two stages . The first would raise electric bills by 8.8 per cent by July 1 , and the second would raise the original bill by an additional .12.9 per cent by March , 1976 . Credit Rating a Factor During his news conference , Mr. Luce said that Con Edison needed the $456-million increase to cover its own inflated expenses , restore its credit rating and obtain enough capital to finance new projects . He complained that the company 's rating was so low that it could no longer market its bonds and that its common stock , which is selling for about $11 share , was only at a third of book value and was at the 1pwest level of any major utility in the country . Mr. Luce said that Con Edison planned to invest $1.9-billion in construction over the next five years , provided it had the necessary capital . The chairman of Con Edison said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not granted " the city , state and Federal Government would he faced with subsidizing electric service .
