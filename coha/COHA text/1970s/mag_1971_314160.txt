MEMOIRS OF MADAME DE LA TOUR DU PIN , edited and translated by Felice Harcourt . 468 pages . McCall . $8.95 . <P> <P> Aristocrats make just awful tyrants , admitted that fairest-minded of Frenchmen , Alexis de Tocqueville . But at their best , he insisted , " they rarely entertain groveling thoughts ; and they show a kind of haughty contempt for petty pleasures , even when they indulge in them . " <P> A case in point is Henriette-Lucy Dillon , the Marquise de La Tour du Pin . On the first Bastille Day , this remarkable noblewoman was 19 and an apprentice lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette . Her husband was son of the Minister for War . She had grown up in a summer chateau that numbered 25 guest rooms . <P> In brief , young Madame de La Tour du Pin had a lot to lose - and by the time she was 24 , fleeing for her life to America , she had lost most of it . What she never lost was the sort of aristocratic attitude that kings can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the Memoirs at the age of 50 as a family letter addressed to her son Aymar , the only survivor of the seven children she had borne . With wit and unsentimental precision she recollected the exact details of a world that had vanished as if it never existed . What delights today 's reader , though , is less the firsthand history ( from the 1770s until Napoleon 's return from Elba in 1815 ) than the self-portrait that slowly emerges .

No problem where Madame de La Tour du Pin was concerned . The Good Old Days did not look all that good to her . She rated Marie Antoinette high on courage , low on intelligence and zero on tact . Louis XVI resembled " some peasant shambling along behind his plough . " As for her fellow aristocrats- " laughing and dancing our way to the precipice " - almost all had been " sublimely blind . " <P> With her farm wife 's ingenuity-obviously she had learned more than English from reading Robinson Crusoe as a girl-Madame de La Tour du Pin had the star-survivor qualities of a first-generation American . She found nothing to compare with the beauty of the Hudson River at West Point . She made friends with America 's aristocrats , the Indians . Her monogrammed butter was in demand . But the marquis evidently was a less happy exile , eager to resume his career in French public life at the first opportunity . <P> Obediently , Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of the Directorate . " I felt no pleasure at returning , " she wrote , then complained no more . As Napoleon rose to Emperor , she settled down to a Frenchwoman 's perennial business-being charming where it does the most good , come revolution or restoration .
