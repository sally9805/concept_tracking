As he drives across the southern U.S. in a $6,500 souped-up orange Pontiac sports car , the character called " GTO ' picks up half a dozen strays . As each hitchhiker gets into the bucket seat beside him , GTO shrewdly sizes him up and , chameleonlike , takes on a completely new identity , one that he hopes will impress his listener . Spinning out fantasies about imaginary pasts , GTO becomes by turns a gambler , a television producer , a racer , a war hero . The role of GTO in the movie Two Lane Blacktop calls for virtuoso acting , and gets it-from a 43-year-old veteran of a hundred movie and television westerns named Warren Gates . Still little known to the public , Oates is now being described by directors as a new Paul Muni , a John Garfield , a Humphrey Bogart . <P> Oates manages the role of the fantasist faultlessly . His eyes gleam , his smile shifts . Sometimes his face seems to be under two separate spells , one side of it benign , the other twitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his defenses collapse , as when GTO sits in a North Carolina roadside diner and abstractedly orders " champagne and caviar and chicken sandwiches on toast . " Suddenly there is a despairing glimpse of a schizophrenic life cracked by thwarted dreams . <P> Ragging the Hillbilly . With all its variety , the role bears some surprising resemblances to Oates ' own life . He was born in Depoy , Ky. , a poverty pocket in the coal-mining district . When the family lost its general store during the Depression , his father went to work at odd jobs on the road while his mother took in boarders . His Great-Aunt Sis used to tell about the night she took in Jesse James and his partner just before they robbed a bank in Russelville . They left a $10 gold piece under a breakfast plate . As a kid in bib overalls , Warren pitched in and did his share ; he picked strawberries for 2 a quart , wormed tobacco for 25 a day , loaded sand onto trucks for road builders . <P> When he was 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ragged by his classmates for being " a hillbilly who dressed funny . " Lonely , he spent most of his time in trouble at school , hanging out at the roller rink and getting into fistfights . At 18 , Oates joined the Marines , because " I figured if I did n't , I 'd end up in jail . " After a two-year stint as an airplane mechanic , he landed at the University of Louisville . He drifted in and out of courses in business administration , anthropology and English . Introduced to drama when he read Eugene O'Neill 's Mourning Becomes Electra , Oates tried a student theater group . " After that , I did n't care about much else . I discovered that acting gave me an identity . "
