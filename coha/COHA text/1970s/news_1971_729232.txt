txt Last Thursday morning a large van pulled up to a loading dock at the Government Printing Office and was loaded with thousands of new tax forms . Just as the truck was pulling a*ay from the platform , a supervisor scrambled out of the printing office and hollered to the driver to stop . The Internal Revenue Service had changed its mind , he shouted , and did not want the forms to go out . Thus ended  --  under the prodding of labor unions and business groups  --  a new tax policy that would have required them to divulge in detail the extent of their political and lobbying activities . Same Form for All The new requirement was embodied in only one question Ion one form but would have given the Internal Revenue ' Service a substantial amount of I new information on politicalli and lobbying activities , given the public access to that infort.nation and perhaps have threatened the tax-exempt sta- ' tus of some unions and some ' business groups . This year , for the first time , ' all tax-exempt organizations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past , only traditional charitable organizations ? the Boy Scouts , churches , hospitals , the Red Cross  --  had to use a form that required them to provide " a detailed description " of their political or lobbying activities . Other tax-exempt organizations  --  including labor unions , chambers of commerce and trade associations  --  had to // tell the Internal Revenue Services just the total amount they spent on such activities . The new form would have required all organizations to provide the " detailed description . " According to reliable sources , the revenue service took this step to find out what the unions and business organizations were doing with regard to politics and legislation in order to see if any of them should lose their tax . exemptions . A spokesman for the I.R.S. denied this today . He said : " It was an error . We had no intention of asking the questions we asked . The error resulted from combining two or three questions from two previous forms into a single question on the new form . " Donations to charitable organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The traditional charitable organizations are severely restricted ' in their lobbying and can lose their tax-exempt status if lobbying becomes a " substantial " part of their activities . The rule that applies to , labor and business associations is a looser one because the contributions they receive are not tax deductible . Generally they are permitted to lobby extensively and remain tax-exempt as long as their primary purpose remains the purpose for which they were originally granted the exemptions . No Previous Rule The revenue service had not previously required detailed reports from the labor and business groups on their lobbying and political activities . Here is what happened , as pieced toget:mr sources : In December the revenue service decided that all taxexempt organizations would fill in the same form and that the form would require a detailed description of political and lobbying activities , The form was approved by Randolph W. Thrower , commissioner of the Federal agency . On Jan , 6 , a printer 's proof of the new form was issued and ? in accordance with standard procedure ? copies were submitted to lawyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reaction , and the forms were printed up . A total of 500,000 packages were produced that contain the form , instructions and related tax schedules . On Wednesday of ? last week calls began to come in from lawyers and tax-exempt organizations . Some of the organizations had apparently begun to look more closely at the new form and had spotted the new question . Two of the first calls came from a lawyer at a Washington law firm that represents several smaller trade associations and from a tax expert at the United States Chamber of Commerce , Other calls came from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and the National Association of Manufacturers . The callers argued that the physical burden of providing the data would be overwhelming and that , in any case , the revenue service had no right to ask for the data since , they contended , it did not relate to whether the organizations were tax-exempt . The next clay , Thursday ? after several such calls had come in ? John E. Chapoton , the tax legislative counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop distribution of the new forms . It was at that point that the supervisor at the printing office was barely able to keep the form-laden van from leaving . Thursday evening there was a meeting of four officials and their staffs at the I.R.S. Present I were Edwin S. Cohen , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy ; John S. Nolan , Deptity Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy ; Mr. Thrower ; and K. Martin Worthy , chief counsel of the revenue service . After two hours of discussion , the group decided to go back to the old system and not require unions and business organizations to make detailed disclosure . Three Possible Choices Once the group had made this decision , they had a mechanical problem ? what to do about the new form . There were three choides : throw away the 500,000 forms , insert an explanatory sheet or paste a label on the forms . At one point , one of the officials wondered aloud whether just throwing them away was n't the best idea . " How much did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty-five thousand dollars , " was the answer . " Well , " he said , " that 's not bad . Let 's throw them away . " Ultimately , the group decided to have a label printed and pasted on . Before the Treasury Department was willing to accept this solution , however , it insisted that the revenue service call the ** the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers and make sure the wording of the label was acceptable to them . " There is nothing strange about that , " a spokesman for the agency said today . " We went back to some of the people that called the error to our attention and asked if the label would correct the error . " Revenue service officials called the three organizations late Friday afternoon and found that the wording of the label was acceptable to them They then ordered the labels printed and attached to the forms . The forms should be mailed out to tax-exempt organizations shortly .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
