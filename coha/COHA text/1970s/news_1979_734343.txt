txt J.R . JENKINS , 45 , a Calumet City man whose only child , a teen-age son , was shot to death four years ago in a quarrel over marijuana , was found guilty Friday night of plotting murder to avenge his son 's death . A jury in the Markham branch of Criminal Court convicted Jenkins of conspiracy to kill his son 's confessed slayer . But in an acknowledged compromise to avoid a deadlock , the jury acquitted Jenkins of plotting a second murder , that of an admitted drug pusher who sold marijuana to the 10-year-old youth , Thaddeus " Ted " Jenkins . The jury of eight men and four women also acquitted codefendant Thomas Young , 24 , of charges that he participated with a confessed hit man to kill Thaddeus Jenkins ' slayer , Robert Osborne , l ' / , but shot Osborne 's brother , James , 16 , by mistake .

THE VERDICTS came after eight hours of deliberation . During the trial , Jenkins , a sign company foreman , was portrayed by his attorneys as a hardworking and devoted father .

Robert Osborne , who was shot to death the following year in a still unsolved homiCide , had said he shot Jenkins in a quarrel over money to buy marijuana and that he had acted in self-defense , In what prosecutors said was a bungled attempt on Osborne 's life , his brother , James , was critically wounded by two men  --  Young allegedly was one of them  --  when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on Nov. 6 , 1975 , That was the same day that the elder Jenkins was quoted as telling a coroner 's jury in the inquest into the death of his son , " Why must it be put in our hands ?

Jenkins murder , but authorities in Will County , where the slaying occurred , had declined to prosecute him .
