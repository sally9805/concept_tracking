txt Reversing his long-standing opposition to stronger income policy measures to control ' inflation , President Nixon stated today he would consider a wage-price review board if it will not " stifle the economy . " Moreover , the President suggested that the National Commission on Productivity , which will meet Sept. 21 , might act as such a board because it " will look at each individual settlement in major industries where there is going to be wage-price negotiations , and use the influence we can to keep them in line . " Senators Seek Board The shift in the official position came hours after 12 Republican senators introduced legislation to create a wageprice review board . The announcement was greeted by Treasury Secretary John B. Connally , who said the administration will welcome a " full-fledged debate in the Congress . More than half of a 48-minute impromptu press conference Nixon held today was devoted to the state of the economy . Nixon , generally optimistic , repeated the prediction he made earlier this year that 1971 would be a " good year for the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seeks to Soften Reports At the same time , the President tried to soften press reports of a sharp difference of opinion between the chief executive and Dr. Arthur F. Burns , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . He said he and Burns see eye-to-eye on most major policy positions , and that any differences were a matter of degree . He also knocked down stories that he had rejected a pay increase for Burns . To the contrary , he said , Burns indicated that " neither , he nor any other individual in a high position of government should take a salary increase " at a time when the President would have to limit salary increases in other areas of government , including blue collar workers , Lauds Burns ' Actions " Arthur Burns , in , terms *of monetary policy and in terms of fiscal policy , has followed a course that I think is the most responsible and statesmanlike of any chairman of the Federal Reserve in my memory , " Nixon said . Turning to questions on income policy , the President said categorically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permanent wage and price controts on major corporations and large labor unions . A Mortal Blow to U. S. " Permanent wage and price controls in America , " he said , " Would stifle the American economy , its dynamism , its productivity , and would be , I think , a mortal blow to the United States as a first-class economic power . " However , Nixon said , he is not opposed to using the government 's power " where it can be effective " to stop the escalation in the wage-price spiral , He added that he does not believe those advocating a wageprice review board favor compulsion or criminal penalties as part of the enforcement mechanism . " So far as we are concerned , I am glad to consider recommendations for tackling the wage-price ' problem , " he told reporters . " I will tackle them , and I am serving notice now that we are going to take the problem up with the productivity commission .. But I will reject wage-price boards if I find that it would impose a new burocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American economy . That , I think , would do far more harm than good . " . The President called the recent settlements in the steel and railroad industries constructive because they " spoke to the problem of productivity . " But he indicated he would not seek to force the steel producers to rescind their 8 per cent price increase , " Calling in the steel industry and getting them to change would not be effective , " he said . " . . . At a time that the steel industry has negotiated a settlement of this nature , at a time when its profits at 2.5 per cent are the lowest of any major industry , to tell the steel industry that after they have negotiated a settlement they must roll back their prices and run at a loss is simply unrealistic . They are not going to do it , " Sen .. Jacob K. Javits R. , N. Y.1 , one of the sponsors of the bill to create a wage-price hoard , said Nixon 's present policies have failed to slow the price spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to Javits , Edward Brooke Mass . , J.
