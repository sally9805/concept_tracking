While studying aerial photographs of the Nile Delta after their country 's 1967 conquest of the Sinai , Israeli geologists noticed soil markings that were clearly vestiges of two dried-up waterways . One was quickly identified as a silted offshoot of the Nile River called the Pelusiac branch ( after the ancient city of Pelusium at its mouth ) . The nature of the other waterway baffled the geologists until they visited the area and found man-made embankments . With that , they realized that these old mounds marked the route of a remarkable ancient canal that predated the Suez Canal by as many as 4,000 years. * <P> From its Mediterranean terminus at Pelusium , the so-called Eastern Canal probably headed south for ten miles , veered across what is now the Suez Canal near the town of Qantara , and approached Lake Timsah near Ismailia , where old canal remnants have previously been found . Though wind , sand and irrigation works have wiped out much of the canal 's course , Geologists Amihai Sneh , Tuvia Weissbrod and Itamar Perath hint at an intriguing possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch following a great east-west depression called Wadi Tumilat to link with the Nile , the other continuing south into the Red Sea along a route that became part of a canal system later built by the Persian conqueror Darius . <P> The old waterway probably ranged in depth from 7 ft. to 10 ft. , adequate for ancient barges , but the embankments were 200 ft. apart , much wider than necessary for the water traffic of that day . The Israeli scientists think they know why . Writing in American Scientist , they point out that a wide channel would have made it an effective barrier against invaders from the east , a constant threat to ancient Egypt . In addition , it would have provided essential irrigation water . Could the ancient Egyptians have built such a great canal ? Yes , say the geologists . After all , hundreds of years earlier the Egyptians had already tackled another project of comparable magnitude : the construction of their first pyramids . <P> <P> * A date based on references in old chronicles.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
