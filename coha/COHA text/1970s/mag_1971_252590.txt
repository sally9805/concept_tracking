AS the annual crop of desktop evergreens and water cooler wreaths attest , Christmas permeates every branch of the workaday world . In this holiday season , however , office parties , business gifts , Christmas cards to customers and year end bonuses to employees are not as pervasive as in previous years . Caution about the economy , confusion over Phase 11 , and a generally rising level of employee sophistication have combined to produce a crunch that is taking away those Christmas extras . <P> <P> The policy on bonuses has not been fully defined by the Pay Board in Washington . In general , companies can grant the same size bonuses as in previous years . If a firm paid little or no bonus last year because business was bad , but had a record in prior years of giving a bonus , this year 's payout would probably be permitted . Companies that seek to raise their bonuses are expected to adhere to the board 's 5.5% limit on overall pay increases . Thus , whatever a company adds to its bonuses , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits in order to stay within the 5.5% limit . <P> In many firms , holiday bonuses are shrinking or disappearing altogether . Wall Street 's brokerages , for example , are not all the generous year end Santas they were during the peaks of the mid 1960s . At the New York Stock Exchange itself , the 1969 bonus of nearly 10% of salary for almost all the exchange 's 3,000 employees is down to 71% for the second year in a row . <P> <P> Some companies that still make holiday payouts , like Los Angeles ' Security Pacific National Bank , are turning to employee profit-sharing plans as a more rational way to spread good fortune around . But 1971 was not a particularly cheery profit year , and workers whose bonuses are tied to corporate earnings may find it a cruel Yule instead . At General Motors the bonus schedule has been redrawn to exclude employees earning less than $24,000 , instead of $15,000 as in 1969 . Last year , no bonuses were paid because of the lengthy United Auto Workers strike . One survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37% will grant holiday payments this year v. more than 39% last year .
