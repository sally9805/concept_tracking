It sounds like a story out of the Hollywood of 60 years or so ago : entrepreneurs operating with little more than a few thousand dollars worth of equipment and some space in a garage make fortunes distributing movies all over the world . In the cinema business of 1975 , however , the people who fit this description are not producers but pirates , who steal prints of popular films and copy them for illegal sale . <P> In recent years dozens of bootleggers have been collecting up to $500 million annually that should have gone to major studios in legitimate film rentals . The pirates have also become increasingly brazen . While the $14 million disaster thriller Towering Inferno was still in production last year , a San Diego movie theater was showing a 90-minute pirated version put together from prints of individual scenes ( the full movie takes 165 minutes to play ) . On a recent visit to Tel Aviv , two associates of Sam Arkoff , chairman of American International Pictures , to their amazement spotted his film , The Masque of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkoff : " We have never made a distribution deal in Israel . " Some pirates even advertise openly in catalogues such as The Big Reel , published in North Carolina , and The Film Collector , printed in Houston . <P> Piracy is an amazingly effortless business .

Nonetheless , the pirates can easily get prints by bribing or stealing from lab technicians , theater projectionists , members of student and religious groups who rent films , truckers who deliver the prints to theaters , and even the people licensed by the studios to destroy worn-out films . <P> Until now , too , the pirates have had little fear of being caught , or being penalized much if they were .

Currently , however , Chet Brown , the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles , and the major studios are starting a crackdown . Studios like 20th Century-Fox have assigned attorneys full time to film security , and the Motion Picture Association has hired two ex-FBI agents to staff a round-the-clock security office . Last spring Brown , working with the help of the FBI , which conducted more than 100 searches of suspected pirates for stolen prints , got indictments against 16 of them . Last month a Los Angeles jury convicted Budget Films , Inc. of selling stolen prints , including those of Paper Moon and Portnoy 's Complaint , to collectors and theaters in South Africa . Fines against the company and two of its owners could total $46,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 years each .
