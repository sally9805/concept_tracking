The setting is the Mother 's upper-middle-class bedroom dressing room . MOTHER and DAUGHTER are trying on the clothes that Mother bought yesterday . The women should play as if the fourth wall is a full-length wall-to-wall mirror . Everything that money can buy to help make and keep a woman beautiful is in this room . Many of these things are used during the play at the discretion of the actors and director . Or the women may remain stationary at individual dressing tables until the daughter makes her move . The time is the present MOTHER Checking out her body in the wall-to-wall mirror When are you going to get married ? I want some grandchildren . Bring home some nice fellow for us to meet . I know you 're going out with several . Why do n't you settle down on one . Turning to daughter Give Mother a kiss . Oh , I love my little girl . Hugs her DAUGHTER Stop it , Mother . MOTHER Seductively possessive I 'm your mother . I brought you up . I changed your diapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll love to be married . You 're sensual . You like to be hugged and kissed . Let me bite your belly button . p. 3 DAUGHTER Struggling with Mother Stop it , Mother . I hate that . I ca n't stand to have my belly button tickled . MOTHER Almost winning I 'm not tickling . I just want to kiss it . DAUGHTER Pushes her away Stop it , Mother . MOTHER Your father pushes me away too . You 're just like your father . He has n't given me anything lately . He has n't come near me . He wo n't even touch my foot . I ca n't understand it . My father loves to squeeze my foot . My father loves to touch me and tickle my foot , but not my husband . When I go to kiss him , he pulls back . He says , " What do you think I am , a valve you can turn on and off ? " DAUGHTER He loves you . MOTHER He does n't show it . Why wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I always have to be the one to go to him . He 's got everything the way he wants it , and he wo n't give me any loving . Why do n't you find a nice " live one " and settle down ? I ca n't understand it . Your father 's a young man , but every time I try to make love to him , he 's too tired . It 's true he works all the time . But why does he work all the time ? God did n't mean for us to work all the time . Daddy works seven days a week and when he comes home he 's too tired to eat . He does n't listen to me any more . He does n't look in my eyes when I talk to him . You look in my eyes when I talk to you . Why does n't he look in my eyes when I talk to him ? His eyes are all over the room , even when we go out to dinner . I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . His eyes are wandering over every other body in the room but mine . Unpacking shoe boxes Why do n't you get married so we can go shopping ? You never go shopping with me any more . It 's so much fun to go shopping . There are terrific sales on right now . Yesterday I got so many bargains . There was this terrific shoe sale at I. Magnin 's , and I bought two hundred and seventy-five dollars worth of shoes . It was so much fun . Now I have shoes to go with every dress I own , and even some shoes left over so I can go shopping for some new dresses . Name a local dress store ( e.g. , Neiman-Marcus or Bloomingdale 's ) is having a huge sale on evening dresses and I can get a different evening dress to wear to each charity ball . I want you to get married so we can have more in common . Your sister got married and I was so happy for a year and a half until your brother-in-law got transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in grade school . Why do n't you want to make your mother happy ? We 're missing all the sales . I could set you up in a cute house in the Hickory Hills development ten blocks down the road . They 're having a sale on double lots . Land is never going to be any cheaper , you know . There is n't going to be enough land to go around in a few years . If you have your eye on anyone , just give me the word , and I 'll snap up enough lots for your first mansion . You could even live on a lake . They 're building a lake about twenty miles out of town . You could bring your kids up really healthy . I always wanted to waterski . We could get your husband a little red motorboat and waterskis with a matching red wet suit . Your whole family could waterski . It would be so much fun . I wish you 'd have a talk with your father , he 's driving me crazy . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play brings in the jack . Pause But I ca n't go on living like a nun . p. 4 DAUGHTER Mother , you hardly live like a nun . You just got back from Bermuda and Nassau . I thought you had a good time . MOTHER I did , but it was at the gambling table . Your father could n't get it up . DAUGHTER Why do n't you give him Vitamin E ? MOTHER Vitamins schmitamins ! My doctor says you just pee ' em away . DAUGHTER Are n't you getting any ? MOTHER Any what ? DAUGHTER You know what . What you 've been talking about all this time . MOTHER Your father has n't made love to me for five years . DAUGHTER I do n't believe it . MOTHER Well , it seems like five years . You better get married , you 're not getting any younger . DAUGHTER Do n't talk to me that way . I 'm your own daughter . MOTHER That 's why I 'm worried . Who 's going to support you ? DAUGHTER You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few bucks , but not for you . p. 5 DAUGHTER For the sales ? What are you going to do with all the money you 've saved from your perpetual sales ? MOTHER Send your children to college , that 's what . Do you realize how expensive it will be to go to college by the time your children grow up ? The way inflation is going it will be twenty thousand a year just to go to a cow college . DAUGHTER My kids might be too smart to go to college . MOTHER Do n't be crazy . DAUGHTER Who 's crazy here ? MOTHER Hugging daughter again I 'm your mother and I love you and I have your best interests at heart . DAUGHTER Through clenched teeth Then leave me alone . MOTHER Leave you alone ! I have left you alone and look at you . Nineteen  --  and you 're still not married ! DAUGHTER Married ? I have n't met anyone I can even stand . Let me get away from home . I 've got to meet men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on . MOTHER Get married . There 's plenty of time later to get turned on . p. 6 DAUGHTER I believe in love . MOTHER Bull ! That love crap 's just for men . That 's what you use to hook them . Men are so helpless . Listen to me , you 're young and slim and pretty , and you have long , long eyelashes . Here , let me suck them , that 's how I got them so long in the first place . Hold still , and let Mother suck ! That 's a girl . There , does n't that feel good ? You can do that to your own daughter one of these days . MOTHER grabs her shirt DAUGHTER Stay away from my belly button . It makes me want to hit when anyone touches it . MOTHER Come on . Come on . She gets daughter 's T-shirt up and kisses the belly button DAUGHTER Mother , stop it ! Flailing  --  laughing and crying Stop it ! I ca n't stand that ! MOTHER Punctuating speech with kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what it costs to look well ? I spend twenty thousand a year on my hair and face alone . That does n't count the Spa , the gym , aerobics , dancing lessons , or the clothes and shoes . DAUGHTER Pushing Mother off That 's disgusting . People are starving ! p. 7 MOTHER Do n't give me that . The world 's never been better off . DAUGHTER You told me . Every morning , for years , you told me , right there at our breakfast table , to eat because Asian children were starving ! MOTHER And look how beautiful you are . You were a good girl . You ate what I told you to and look at you . Look in the mirror . Look at your assets . Let 's add up your assets . DAUGHTER You 're making me crazy . MOTHER I 'm making you face reality . Women are realists and men are stupid . DAUGHTER If that 's true then I want to be stupid too . MOTHER You ca n't be . Your brains wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right here . Listen to her . You should be studying me . You should study me because one day you have to take my place . DAUGHTER I do n't think so . MOTHER Shakes her You do n't know what you 're saying . You 're still going through the teenage terrors . DAUGHTER I 'm almost twenty . p. 8 MOTHER You 're still a teenager . Admit it ! You 're nineteen years old . I know when you were born , I bore you . DAUGHTER I know all about it and I know how we almost died , and how you had to spend eight months lying upside down on a board to keep me in . . . MOTHER You 're damn right ! I wanted you , and I loved you , and I love you . And I did n't move for eight whole months so that you could be born . DAUGHTER You gave up shopping for eight whole months ? MOTHER I worked my bottom off to get you , and you 're not going to throw it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live quietly . MOTHER You ca n't be quiet yet . You 've got to get married . What if something should happen to your father and me ? We vacation three times a year . We could be killed in a plane crash like Billy Adamson 's parents . He 's a millionaire , now . Did you know that ? There 's a good prospect . He inherited eleven million dollars . DAUGHTER He 's gay . MOTHER Eleven million is eleven million . You can go gay together for that kind of cash . p. 9 DAUGHTER I thought you wanted grandchildren . MOTHER No , I do n't want you to marry him . He does n't believe in God . People should believe in God . DAUGHTER Mother , how can you say that ? MOTHER I just said it . I believe it . DAUGHTER But you do n't believe in God . MOTHER That 's beside the point . Men should believe in God . You can control them better . My God , if men did n't believe in Jesus Christ they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olden times  --  roving bands of men murdering and raping women , burning our homes and carrying off our cows . You 've got to get married to a man who thinks that Jesus Christ is his Savior and then you 'll be able to get anything you want for the rest of your life . DAUGHTER I wo n't listen to you . I do n't want to be a devious person . MOTHER Do n't be a fool . If you do n't use your brains and your intuition you 'll never survive . You 'll just be some joker 's doormat . You 'll be nothing more than a servant . Your children will be passive and ruled by a romantic idiot . You 've got to add up your assets . DAUGHTER I ca n't see life in terms of dollars and cents . p. 10 MOTHER You 've seen too many soaps . I should have forbidden you to see any of those love stories . They gave you a slave mentality . DAUGHTER I want to be a slave to the person I love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother talking . I 'm going to teach you what my grandmother taught me . My mother fell for that romantic crap and I saw first hand how a woman becomes a slave . Look in the mirror . See your hips , see your breasts , see how high and pointy they are ; look at your big , healthy lustrous eyes . You know what you 're worth  --  on the hoof  --  at today 's prices ? A beautiful woman goes to the highest bidder . You 've got three years before the bloom is off those cheeks . There are n't very many genuine beauties in our neck of the woods , so you get top dollar . DAUGHTER This is so crass . I do n't want to hear any more . MOTHER She poses and moves as her idea of the tough-but-smart woman-with-pizzazz Life is crass , baby . But this is about survival . What if your father lost all his money , and believe me , the way the country is going with those idiots in the White House , your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fault . Those Nazis and Japs are running circles around us in this high tech business world . Pretty soon , if we 're not careful , America will just be a salesman for the rest of the world . We do n't even know how to make cars any more . They fall apart before you can drive them off the lot . Your stereo is broken , is n't it ? Is n't it ? p. 11 DAUGHTER Well , it was working last week , . . . sort of . . . MOTHER It is n't working now is it . Why not ? Why not ? Because it was made by General Electric . But my Sony works just fine . Those Japs are n't a joke any more . They learned craftsmanship while we were busy joining the Elks Club and leaving big tips all over . Look in the mirror . See those slim upper arms . How long do you think that will last . Look at mine . I work and work at the gym , but still the flesh sags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half years to land a live one with a future . A live one , with money in the bank , a rich grandmother , and a job with a company that has offices in Germany and Japan and manufacturing plants in Mexico and Brazil . You 'll have a splendid life . And no matter what happens to me , or the United States , you 'll always be sitting pretty however way the cookie crumbles . What do you think I took that short course in the stock market for ? For my own sake ? I 'm your mother . It was to be able to give you proper advice for the future of my grandchildren . DAUGHTER I do n't want to bring children into this money-grubbing world ! MOTHER Softly It does n't have to be this way , but it is this way . And as long as it is this way , it 's my duty as your mother to teach you about it . Do n't you agree ? Do n't you agree that I have to teach you everything I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . It 's all so ugly . MOTHER And you 'll be ugly too in a few years . Ca n't you get that through your head ? Do you think you 're the only one in this family who 's beautiful ? I was beautiful . I was almost as beautiful as you when I was your age . Here , look at this . Who 's this a picture of ? She poses like the photograph DAUGHTER Softening My mother . MOTHER And what does that say ? What does it say on the bottom of this photo ? DAUGHTER " Runner-up . " MOTHER That 's right . I was first runner-up in the Miss Strawberry Queen contest . Do you know where the Queen is today ? Do you know where she is ? DAUGHTER No ? MOTHER You drive past her every morning on your way to school . She runs the " One Hour " cleaning store on Dodge and Cummings . Her husband left her ten years ago . She had four little ones to bring up alone . Go in there someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're almost as soft as yours . Are n't they ? Are n't they ? Feel ! p. 13 DAUGHTER Yes , they are . They 're very soft . MOTHER I wish your father would let me rub his back . He gets so mad when I reach under and stroke that special place between his scrotum and his rectum . Used to be sure fire . I could get him up every time when I did that . But now it just hangs . . . Nothing stirring . Taking her daughter 's head in her hands Baby , it does n't last . The only thing that does is diamonds . Tomorrow we 're going down to the jewelers , and I 'm giving you a seminar in choosing diamonds . DAUGHTER I hate jewelry . MOTHER Not to wear , dummy ! You 're too young to wear diamonds yet . I mean , to put in a safe deposit box . To sell in your old age . Do you think you could live happily on Social Security ? Do you ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DAUGHTER I do n't want to know . MOTHER It 's about time you learned the facts of life . That university you go to is a big fat joke . I know you need that diploma , and I sent you there to meet a better class of man . But , do you know what our cook 's mother gets from this wondrous generous government of ours  --  this woman  --  the mother of our cook ? She worked all her life . She worked in people 's homes from the time she was nine years old . Before that she helped her mother with the eleven other children . This woman , who worked all her life , gets the grand total of a hundred and seventy-eight dollars a month . That 's how she 's rewarded for working all her life . But you do n't want to know about crass things like that . p. 14 DAUGHTER That 's terrible . That 's unfair . MOTHER I 'll say it is , and what are you going to do about it ? DAUGHTER I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't help that woman immediately . I 'm trying to knock some sense into your head while there 's still time , so that does n't happen to you . Will you start to seriously weigh the prospects of the men you know ? DAUGHTER Yes , Mother . I promise you that I 'll try to be more serious about my life . MOTHER That 's all I ask . I love you and Mother wants only the best for you . You 're my great , big , beautiful darling . And I want you to know what this world is really about . DAUGHTER I 'm trying to absorb it , Mother . Although you do n't make it as clear as my chemistry professor . But I 'll try to think about it . Especially just before I go to sleep at night . MOTHER Bring me your college yearbook , dear , and let 's circle the men you like best in each class . Then I 'll call my detective agency to do a credit , character , and family history check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can eliminate the obvious losers , then you can bring the others home , one by one , so I can check out superficial genetic structure . p. 15 DAUGHTER You mean it will be like a game ? MOTHER A wonderful game . That only we know the rules to . I ca n't impress on you enough , how romantic men are . They often ruin their whole subsequent genetic structure by picking a pretty face who has disastrous hidden family defects . I 've watched more than one good family deteriorate because of terrible choices in breeding . I want to live . And I can only live through healthy carriers of my genes . We are pure American stock . We want to have a big  --  a very big  --  stake in the future . This planet is just a laboratory . I want our great-grandchildren to be the first colonizers of a virgin planet  --  out there somewhere  --  where they can start it right . With five acre zoning ! The mongrels and riffraff will be left behind on this experimental planet to freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cools down . But our children will continue , into the expanding universe . Do you understand ? Do you see my vision now ? Can you get it through that pretty head of yours , or ca n't you see past the end of that nose like your father 's ? DAUGHTER With joy Mother . I get it . I get it ! Transference . I can see . I can see what you mean . The vision is coming through to me . It 's taking over . p. 16 MOTHER What vision ? DAUGHTER Your vision . Our vision . Mother , it 's true . I do belong to you . MOTHER My baby . . . you make Mother 's eyes puddle up . DAUGHTER There is n't any time left , is there , Mother ? MOTHER No , darling . It 's almost too late . DAUGHTER You 're a classic . I 'm gon na bundle you up and take you with me . MOTHER Where to ? DAUGHTER Begins to wind negligees around her mother , like mummy wrapping Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The message I 'm getting from my nipple is that our sun is over forty . MOTHER The sun that shines ? DAUGHTER Nods We do n't live in a stable environment . MOTHER This is news ? DAUGHTER I 'm seriously sorry the Space Program 's budget was cut down , because we 've got to get to another galaxy . MOTHER I 'd settle for some extra hairy gonads. p. 17 DAUGHTER I do have a maternal interest in the continuance of our species , no matter how many family fights we 're having at this very instant . My right ovary foresees a series of reactions , fusions , contusions , and shocks that will so clot the earth and build the heat to such a Fahrenheit that the Neo Art Deco Ice Age projected by the Geophysical Survey scientists will not happen . She squirts a nipple at the audience , then goes back to wrapping Mother The Northwest Territories will get as hot as Martinique . MOTHER A little to the left and faster . DAUGHTER This planet is gon na split wide open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This earth is gon na split in two , and this half will carrom off and collide with Venus , and this half will plow Mars , right up his red canal . MOTHER How androgynous . DAUGHTER The force of that collision will throw Mars and Venus out of orbit . Old Mother Sun will suck them and us right back into her flaming cunt . MOTHER No energy gets lost , honey . We 're living in a tidy system . DAUGHTER When we get up into old Mother , her corona is gon na jump so high Jupiter will spin into Uranus and melt his ice . This will make such a righteous torrent of water come flying across our universe , old Mother Sun will drown . Winds material over Mother 's mouth The rest of the planets will be set free to be captured by another galaxy . . . To audience Then where do you think you 'll be ? Give your pennies to N. A. S. A. , your dollars to N. O. W. , and your lettuce to the Lavender Menace . Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sings : My Mother , in her way  --  on her way And waylaid , inside my insides Lays in wait , to wrench you tight . She will grip you hard At the root of your dark night Till she has sucked up all the light She wants  --  . But this is for fun Because she is the sun And needs no light to see her way . She is the way , Never looking where she is going Because she is everywhere . I cling to her like a chimpanzee Sleeping on her never-ending breast , And if I lose my grip No rip is heard . But I do n't have to last Nor do I have to move too fast Because , Mother is always on . END
