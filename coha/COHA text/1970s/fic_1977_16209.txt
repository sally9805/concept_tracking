EXT . HILLY COUNTRY ROAD  --  DAY A large , black , powerful-looking motorcycle waits propped up on its center stand on the gravel shoulder of a deserted country road . The gold lettering on its tank and side covers identifies it as a Norton Commando 850 . Two white Bell full-coverage helmets sit on its saddle , like medieval jousting helmets . Beyond the motorcycle , stretched out on a grassy rise , lie Hart Read , twenty-six , and his long-time girlfriend Rose , who is the kind of eighteen that often seems more like fifteen , and once in a while like twelve . At the moment Rose is definitely eighteen and in control of things , producing tuna sandwiches with lettuce and mayonnaise out of a string bag and pouring coffee , pre-mixed with sugar and milk , from a small thermos flask . Read watches her play housewife with vast amusement . Rose holds out a sandwich . &nbsp; READWhat 've we got , Rose ? Steak on a bun ? &nbsp; ROSETuna with lettuce and mayo .

Rose puts on her helmet , does up the chin strap , and gets on the machine behind Read . Read waits for her to get settled , blips the throttle , then accelerates off the shoulder of the road , fishtailing slightly in the gravel . EXT . HILLY COUNTRY ROAD  --  DAY The Norton booms along the twisty two-lane road . The road is clear and Read feels good . He opens the throttle even more , almost becoming airborne over the crest of a steep rise , and leaning the bike over in the corners until he scrapes rubber off the footpegs . Rose rides loose , completely at ease behind Read . She clasps her arms around him loosely , always going with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EXT . HILLY COUNTRY ROAD  --  DAY Further up the road , a neat white VW pop-top camper trundles along in the opposite direction carrying a middle-aged man , his wife , and their twelve-year-old daughter . They are city slickers out for an autumn camping jaunt , and things are not going well for them . &nbsp; WIFE ( scrutinizing crumpled map ) We passed it . &nbsp; MANWe did n't pass it . I remember that farm . &nbsp; WIFEWe passed it . That farm comes after concession road 12 and we were supposed to turn at concession road 11 . &nbsp; KIDI do n't remember that farm , Dad . &nbsp; MANWe did n't pass it . I very distinctly remember that farm .  --  4  --  &nbsp; WIFEIf you would just stop this vehicle long enough to take a look at the map I will prove to you beyond any shadow of a doubt that we . . . &nbsp; MAN ( losing his temper ) All right ! The man swings the camper across both lanes in one furious motion and slams on the brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a ditch bordering an open field . You 're both right and I 'm all wrong . He slams the camper into reverse and backs up as far as he can , then slams it into first and lurches forward , trying vainly to make a clean three-point turn on the narrow road . We 'll turn around and go all the way back . When the camper is stretched completely across both lanes of the highway , it stalls . The man twists the key viciously but it wo n't restart . Goddamn thing ! Shoulda never sold the goddamn station wagon . &nbsp; KIDThe station wagon used to use too much gas , remember , Dad ? &nbsp; WIFEYou keep quiet when your dad 's in a sweat , Valerie . &nbsp; MAN ( still trying to start the camper ) Goddamn thing . Shoulda never sold the wagon . Without warning , Read 's bike suddenly appears over the crest of the hill just beyond the camper . The bike is nearing 100 miles an hour . The wife sees it first .  --  5  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Huh ? Oh , Christ ! There is no place for Read to go except off the road . The bike shoots over the drainage ditch beside the road two feet from the nose of the camper . The man and his wife sit with their mouths open , watching through their front windshield the bike fly through the air into an overgrown field , as though it were happening on TV . EXT . FIELD  --  DAY When the bike finally lands in the field , it hits down front wheel first . The impact slams Read over the handlebars into the trunk of a small but solid tree . Rose stays with the machine for one complete cartwheel . The motorcycle ends up on top of her , the tank across her belly . Before she can move , the tank explodes into flames . The flames begin to melt the plastic visor of her helmet . EXT . EDGE OF THE FIELD  --  DAY The camper driver turns around in his seat and starts to rummage around , looking for something to put out the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying vainly to get out from under the bike . &nbsp; WIFEOh , my God ! She 's gon na burn ! She 's gon na die ! &nbsp; MANWhere 's the kid 's blanket ? Where 's the kid 's goddamn blanket ! ? Section Details EXT . TERRACE OF KELOID CLINIC  --  DAY Jackie , a cool blonde English woman in her early forties , has been bird-watching from the clinic 's terrace . Something startling attracts her attention .  --  6  --  &nbsp; JACKIEI do n't believe it . Lloyd Walsh , an actor in his late thirties in the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic Surgery for his second facial touch-up , pauses in the middle of a sit-up which he is performing on an exercise mat a few yards away . Walsh is wearing a blue jogging outfit whose top bears the words JOGGING KILLS. His head is bandaged . &nbsp; WALSHWhat is it ? You spot a rare tufted tit-mouse or somethin ' ? Jackie turns away from her binoculars . She has thin surgical wires attached to the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field . I think there 's somebody under it . Walsh jumps to his feet with exaggerated athletic vigor . &nbsp; WALSHYeah ? Lemme have a look . Jackie hands Walsh her binoculars and points him in the right general direction . &nbsp; JACKIESee that column of smoke ? Just follow it down to its source . We look through the binoculars with him as he does so . Sure enough , there is a bike burning in a field with someone trapped beneath it . &nbsp; WALSHWow . Lookit that ! He turns and begins to sprint for the stairway at the end of the terrace . &nbsp; JACKIEWhere are you going ? &nbsp; WALSHGonna tell the boys downstairs . It 's right up their alley .  --  7  --  &nbsp; JACKIEOh. ( calling after the disappearing Walsh ) Careful with my binoculars ! They 're very expensive ! INT . CLINIC BOARDROOM  --  DAY The three partners who own and operate the Keloid Clinic are holding an informal meeting in the posh boardroom of the clinic , with cigars ( Cypher ) , cigarettes , coffee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keloid , a youthful forty-five , low-key but forceful , founder of the Keloid Clinic and extremely successful society plastic surgeon ; Keloid 's wife , Roxanne , who is herself an MD and who was once a student of Keloid 's ; and Murray Cypher , the clinic 's accountant . Cypher is forty-eight , dapper , generally enthusiastic , and believes passionately in creative accounting . It has apparently been a long and tiring session . Cypher in particular shows signs of strain . His end of the table is littered with pages of scratch pad covered with hastily scrawled notes and figures . &nbsp; CYPHERAs far as I 'm concerned these guys are completely legit . The bank is just as convinced as I am . They told me they 're willing to go all the way with us . I 'm telling you , Danny  --  a franchise operation for plastic surgery resorts is one of those magnificent , inevitable ideas . &nbsp; KELOIDBanks are always quick to say that when everything 's rolling easy . But you can take it from me  --  first sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage , and the bank 'll call back its note and leave us hanging by our thumbs . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDIt 's not the financing that 's bothering you , Dan . Your voice has that edge to it .  --  8  --  &nbsp; KELOIDI 've never denied it . I sure as hell do n't want to become the Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery . &nbsp; CYPHERWhy not ? Sounds great to me . &nbsp; KELOIDI 'll tell you why not . Because it 's unprofessional , unmedical , and unsavory . &nbsp; CYPHERYou thought of it . &nbsp; KELOIDI was only kidding . &nbsp; CYPHERYou were not . Besides , you want me to go back and tell three of the largest investment groups in North America , Forget it . He was only kidding ? &nbsp; KELOID ( in only partially mock despair ) Oh , God . It 's all gotten out of hand . I can see it now : fifty enfranchised Keloid 's Cosmetic Surgery Clinics flung across the face of North America like Holiday Inns . Next thing you know , Do-It-Yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it . . . we could call it Suture Self . ( starts to scribble madly ) No , I 'm serious . I like that . There 's got to be a way . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDAll right , boys . I think we 're getting a bit silly . . . The office intercom on the table chimes and the voice of Steve , an orderly , fills the room . &nbsp; STEVE ( V.O. ) Is Dr Keloid there ? It 's urgent .  --  9  --  &nbsp; KELOIDYeah , what is it , Steve ? &nbsp; STEVE ( V.O. ) There 's been a motorcycle accident a few minutes down the highway here . Looks like a couple of people have been hurt . Should I take the van and go get ' em ? &nbsp; KELOIDYeah , sure . ( short pause ) Hey , wait a minute . Steve ? You still there ? &nbsp; STEVE ( V.O. ) Yeah . &nbsp; KELOIDHang on till I get there , OK ? I 'm coming with you . Meet you at the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes off as Keloid stands up to leave . Cypher throws his pen on the table . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOID ( exasperated ) Oh , now , Dan . We 've got a lot of decisions to make . . . &nbsp; KELOID ( leaving ) You and Murray work it out , hon. Just make the pill easy for me to swallow , OK ? He closes the door behind him , leaving Cypher and Roxanne to their own devices . &nbsp; CYPHERWell , what do you think about facelift kits , Roxy ? I mean , they 've got abortion kits .  --  10  --  &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOID ( frustrated ) Let 's just forget that anybody ever mentioned the idea , OK , Murray ? Cypher shrugs . It still sounds great to him . EXT . CLINIC DRIVEWAY  --  DAY In the middle of a landscaped triangle of lawn stands a large light-box-style sign which reads KELOID CLINIC OF COSMETIC SURGERY . Along one side of the triangle runs a crushed-gravel driveway at the end of which is a long , low garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might once have been a small stable . One of the three doors of the garage slides up and a van peels rubber out of the garage , sliding a bit once it hits the gravel . The van is set up inside and out exactly like a standard big-city ambulance , but without any ambulance markings . Instead , sedate white lettering on the doors reads KELOID CLINIC , LTD . Section Details EXT . FIELD  --  DAY Read lies crumpled at the base of the tree . The end of his right collarbone is sticking out at a bizarre angle and his right shoulder is hanging too low . Read has regained enough consciousness to feebly undo his helmet with his left hand . Beyond him , clouds of oily black smoke curl skywards from the fallen Norton . Read can hardly focus his eyes on the figures running toward them from the camper at the edge of the field . He slips dreamily into unconsciousness . INT . VAN  --  DAY The clinic van turns off a secondary road on to the two-lane highway and accelerates furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the back of the van are Steve , who is busily preparing stretchers and oxygen , and Dr Keloid.  --  11  --  Keloid prepares several hypodermic syringes while expertly bracing himself against the motion of the van . Steve finishes attaching a hose to a small cylinder of oxygen and turns the release valve to test the oxygen flow through the nose-piece . &nbsp; STEVEWell , we 've got oxygen now , Dr Keloid . Keloid watches the thin column of black smoke looming larger through the windshield of the van . He reaches for a small fire extinguisher affixed to the frame of the van and begins to undo the clamps holding it there . &nbsp; KELOIDI think we 're going to have to use this before we get close enough for the oxygen , Steve . EXT . FIELD  --  DAY Rose has stopped moving under the flaming machine . The man from the camper , running and stumbling over the uneven ground , finally arrives , followed by his older son ( who is about thirteen ) . The man tries vainly to smother the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too intense for him to get really close . The man is almost in tears with horror and frustration . His son just stares wide-eyed . EXT . EDGE OF FIELD  --  DAY The clinic van bounces to a halt by the edge of the field and the driver , the most junior of the clinic 's four orderlies , jumps out and runs around to the back of the van . The back doors swing open and Keloid jumps out with the fire extinguisher in one hand and a small leather bag in the other . He heads for the flames as the wife and her kid watch from the front seats of the camper . The wife sticks her head out of the window and points at the flames .  --  12  --  &nbsp; WIFE ( to Keloid ) They 're over there , Doctor ! They were speeding ! Keloid is soon followed by the two orderlies carrying a large wheeled stretcher , which they have hauled from the back of the van . EXT . FIELD  --  DAY The man who was driving the camper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket when Keloid arrives and opens up the valve of the fire extinguisher . The white powdery foam covers everything in a few seconds , killing the flames easily . &nbsp; MAN ( to Keloid ) I tried to put it out . I could n't get near it . Keloid kneels beside Rose . He takes a pair of scissors from his bag and cuts the helmet strap under her chin . He slips the helmet off her head with great care . Her long blonde hair falls into a pool around her face , which seems remarkably at peace and untouched : only a rectangle of black soot where her helmet 's visor melted away and admitted smoke gives any indication of what she 's gone through . When the orderlies arrive , the man points out Read for them . &nbsp; MANThere 's another one over there . I saw him movin ' around a minute ago . &nbsp; KELOID ( to orderlies ) Might as well go get him . We wo n't be ready to move her for a few minutes . The orderlies trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them leave , then turns back to look at Rose . He shakes his head as Keloid gives her an injection . &nbsp; MANChrist . I did n't know it was a girl . Is she dead ?  --  13  --  &nbsp; KELOIDThis is n't embalming fluid I 'm shooting into her . See if you can lift the machine off her . Use the blanket around your hands . It 's hot . The man wraps the blanket around his hands and begins to half-pull , half-slide the Norton off Rose by the handlebars . The orderlies go by on their way to the van with Read unconscious on the stretcher . As the bike slides away to reveal Rose 's abdomen , the man recoils in horror . &nbsp; MANMy God . Section Details EXT . COUNTRY ROAD  --  DAY The clinic van speeds along the road toward the clinic . INT . VAN  --  DAY Rose is on the stretcher with intravenous tubes in her arms , bottles hanging over her head , an oxygen mask over her mouth and nose , and several layers of blood-soaked bandages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors the oxygen flow , the IV levels , and Rose 's pulse , while Keloid speaks to someone at the clinic over the van 's CB radio , which has a telephone-style speaker/ receiver . Read sits jammed into a small seat behind the driver , his head back against the van wall , completely dazed . He is conscious enough to wince in pain with every bump the van hits , but he obviously does n't know where he is or why he 's there . &nbsp; KELOIDRoxanne ? Yeah , listen . We 're going to have to throw in everything we 've got . I know , but let me tell you what we 're looking at . The gas tank exploded over the girl 's abdomen and I do n't know what she 's got left in there . The man 's got a broken hand , separated shoulder , concussion ,  --  14  --  the usual . We can send him to the General . But it 's definitely major surgery for her , and right now . I know we 're not , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a half hour to live and it 's three hours to the nearest serious hospital . It 's us or nobody . Yeah . I hope I can remember too . Well , they say it 's like riding a bicycle . EXT . CLINIC DRIVEWAY  --  DAY The van stops in front of the clinic and the orderlies jump out . Keloid holds the bottles and the oxygen as the orderlies unload the stretcher and roll it up the front walk of the clinic , which is a spectacularly renovated old farmhouse  --  all sandblasted auburn brick , pine , and cedar planking , white paint and Vista Vision windows . A group composed of patients and staff cluster around the main doors of the clinic to watch as the stretcher approaches . Nobody seems to notice Read , who has been left sitting in the van . INT . CLINIC ENTRANCE  --  DAY Lloyd Walsh holds open one of the main glass doors while a nurse opens the other one . The secretary  --  receptionist abandons her phones and her sleek plastic desk/filing cabinet module to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a look . Walsh makes room for the secretary  --  Sheila  --  beside him . Rose is wheeled through the doors . Her condition is so obviously serious and so different from the usual touch-up jobs done at the Keloid Clinic , which has a carefully calculated country resort atmosphere about it , that everyone becomes completely silent as she enters . &nbsp; KELOID ( to nurse at door ) Get the guy in the van into observation and check him out . But take it easy  --  concussion , separated shoulder , broken hand . OK , Louise ? Maybe some Demerol when he becomes lucid .  --  15  --  &nbsp; LOUISEOK , Dr Keloid . Louise leaves the door once the stretcher has gone by and heads out to the van . Walsh lets go of his door and jogs after her . Jackie , still wearing sunglasses , shakes her head as she watches the stretcher go off down the hall and turns to the middle-aged lady standing next to her . &nbsp; JACKIEWhat a waste . She does n't even need a nose job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher down a hallway which was patently never meant to be used as a hospital corridor : Rose is getting a very rough ride . As they move along they pass various patients who react with shock and horror when they see Rose . The Keloid Clinic is usually more discreet about blood than a normal hospital . &nbsp; MAN ( as Rose passes ) Jesus wept ! What 's that all about ? &nbsp; WOMANSomebody said something about an accident . &nbsp; MAN ( repulsed ) Could n't they throw a sheet over it or something ? I 'm starting to feel like I 'm in a hospital . The fastidious man and his companion go through some doors which , according to an elegantly lettered sign on a wall , lead to a squash court . The orderlies stop in front of another set of doors . Keloid hands one of them the bottles he has been holding as a second nurse , Rita , comes out to meet them . Rita is a very solid , square-bodied , fortyish lady .  --  16  --  &nbsp; KELOIDOK , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her up for the works . INT . SURGICAL WASH-UP  --  DAY Keloid and Roxanne wash with disinfectant in preparation for Rose 's operation , aided by a third orderly whom we have not seen before . Roxanne is short , dark , intense , and ambitious beyond her present practice . She does not wear her thirty-seven years particularly well , so the age difference between her and her husband seems more theoretical than anything else . She is very particular about being called by her maiden name and is known as Dr Rushton to all the clinic 's patients . At the moment , Keloid and Roxanne are having a very controlled , low-key argument which Roxanne tries to keep the orderly from hearing . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDI do n't buy it , Dan . &nbsp; KELOIDYou have n't seen her . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDI do n't have to see her . Neutral field grafts have never been used internally . We could end up with a terminal cancer patient on our hands . &nbsp; KELOIDAw , c'm on . We can monitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does n't have enough small intestine left to absorb nutrient . If we just close her up she 'll have to be fed intravenously for the rest of her life , which will be a short and a dismal one . But if we graft neutral field tissue cones into the abdominal cavity , there 's a chance that they 'll read her condition by post-embryonic induction and develop into a new set of intestines.  --  17  --  &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDOr run wild and make some very creative malignant tumors . Dan , the clinic does n't need this . Let 's play it safe . Keloid does n't respond . He finishes snapping on his surgical gloves and turns to the scrub-nurse , who helps him on with his sterilized operating tunic . INT . OBSERVATION ROOM  --  DAY Read has regained full consciousness in the clinic 's observation room and is watching Louise cut away his well-worn leather motorcycle jacket with a pair of snub-nosed surgical scissors . She cuts her way up the right sleeve to the shoulder , then across the shoulder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket easily away from Read 's right shoulder , which is still very obviously not where it should be . She now starts in on his Norton T-shirt , which is all he was wearing underneath his jacket . &nbsp; READOh , no . Not the T-shirt . Rose gave me the T-shirt . &nbsp; LOUISEI think you 'd find it pretty painful trying to take if off the standard way . Read makes an attempt to slip his arm out of his T-shirt but immediately gives up , grimacing in pain . &nbsp; READNo , look . I think I can . . . Ow ! Oh ! You 're right . Cut the thing off . I 'll put it up on the wall of my garage . Louise continues snipping off the T-shirt . So when do I get to see Rose ? &nbsp; LOUISENot for a while . &nbsp; READWhy not ?  --  18  --  Louise does n't answer . Read pulls away from Louise and tries to stand up . He ca n't keep his balance and falls back against the wall , banging his wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ow ! Oh , God . I did n't kill her , did I ? Louise reaches for a syringe of Demerol . &nbsp; LOUISEShe 's not dead . &nbsp; READWhat is that stuff ? I do n't want you to put me out . &nbsp; LOUISEIt 's just Demerol . It 'll ease the pain . All right ? Read lets Louise take his good arm . She swabs him down and sinks the needle in . &nbsp; READ ( sarcastically ) Sure . Wonderful . Anything to ease the pain . INT . OPERATING ROOM  --  DAY Keloid and Roxanne are well into their operation on Rose , assisted by a team of five which includes Dr William Karl , the clinic 's anesthetist . Keloid and Roxanne are in the process of cutting large squares of skin from Rose 's thighs . &nbsp; KELOIDNow , I know everyone here is familiar with the standard techniques of skin grafting , but what we 're going to do is a little out of the ordinary . I 'll explain it as we go . We 're removing full-thickness skin grafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition procedure . However , before these grafts are applied to the damaged areas of the patient 's breasts , abdomen , and so on , they will be treated so that they become morphogenetically  --  19  --  neutral . They are then called neutral field grafts . &nbsp; KARLCan we treat the graft material here , Dr Keloid ? &nbsp; KELOIDNo , Dr Karl . The graft tissue will be frozen and sent to the Sperling Institute . We 'll have to keep the patient in an operation-ready state until it comes back to us . That 's going to be a bit trying for all of us , but it ca n't be helped . As Keloid speaks , the sections of thigh skin are placed in spun aluminum cylinders of the same general type as those used in eye banks . The cylinders are then sealed and placed in a medical freezer . &nbsp; RITAI do n't understand the functional difference between neutral field and normal graft tissue , Doctor . &nbsp; KELOIDWell , when the thigh skin tissue is treated , Nurse Benedetto , it 'll lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , if it were grafted to a burned cheek , it would n't just be thigh skin with the color and texture of thigh skin  --  it would actually develop as facial tissue . In other words , neutral field tissue has the same ability to form any part of the human body that the tissue of a human embryo has . &nbsp; KARLDoctor , this patient has lost most of her absorptive intestinal mucosa . Could neutral field tissue reconstruct an organ as complex as the small intestine . &nbsp; KELOIDYes , Dr Karl . I think that under the right circumstances it could . I 've done it myself using lab animals at the Sperling Institute . Keloid and Roxanne exchange glances , then Keloid looks away . Let me add that there is always a possibility that carcinomas  --  20  --  will form when neutral field grafts are used internally . In this case , we 're using a radical plastic-surgery technique to compensate for our lack of heavy medical hardware . We 're doing it to save a life . It 's the only trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wide shot of exterior front of the Keloid Clinic in late autumn . SLOW DISSOLVE TO : &nbsp; pp. 21-38 EXT . KELOID CLINIC  --  ONE MONTH LATER  --  DAY Same shot as previous scene , one month later . Snow is on the ground and the trees are bare . SLOW DISSOLVE TO : INT . ROSE 'S ROOM AT THE KELOID CLINIC  --  DAY Read stands over Rose 's bed , which is a very well-disguised hospital bed ( everything possible is done to keep the clinic from feeling like a hospital ) . Read 's left hand is encased in a wire cage which supports all his fingers . He is watching Rose intently , who is still in a coma and is attached to a battery of intravenous bottles connected to her by clear vinyl tubes and IV needles . Read is particularly fascinated by Rose 's eyes , which he can see moving around wildly behind her eyelids . He bends close , then kisses her gently on her pale , dry lips . INT . CLINIC HALLWAY  --  DAY Nurse Louise walks briskly down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes Judy Glasberg clutching a pocket edition of The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud and strolling thoughtfully in the opposite direction . &nbsp; LOUISEHi , Judy Glasberg . You back again ?  --  21  --  &nbsp; JUDYDaddy did n't think the new nose was different enough , so I 'm in for more alterations . I keep telling him it looks just like his , and he keeps saying , That 's why I want you to change it. I 'm terrified to find out what it all means . They both laugh . The two women part and go their separate ways . We follow Louise as she opens the door to Rose 's room , which bears a printed sign saying : INTENSIVE CARE , QUALIFIED PERSONNEL ONLY . INT . ROSE 'S ROOM  --  DAY Louise enters the room in time to surprise Read in the act of pulling back the sheet covering Rose . &nbsp; LOUISEDid n't you see the sign on the door , Mr Read ? You 're supposed to register with me before you come in here . &nbsp; READI saw it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the bed and covers Rose up again . Her entire body is heavily bandaged , and almost every inch of exposed skin has an IV needle taped to it . Louise begins to moisten Rose 's eyelids and lips with various gels . &nbsp; LOUISEWhat are you trying to do , give her pneumonia ? &nbsp; READI 'm trying to ease my guilt feelings by telling myself that Rose is getting better . &nbsp; LOUISE ( softening ) I see . Is it working ? &nbsp; READIs she getting better ?  --  22  --  &nbsp; LOUISEYou 've been here often enough in the past two months to know as much as I do . &nbsp; READWhen do I get to see Dr Keloid ? &nbsp; LOUISEYou never tell me in advance when you 're coming . How can I make an appointment for you ? &nbsp; READI never know in advance when the next wave of guilt will hit me . I want to see him right now . &nbsp; LOUISEHe 's in a meeting . &nbsp; READTell him I forced you . &nbsp; LOUISE ( leaving the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching until she 's conscious . &nbsp; READOK , Mom . Louise makes a face and leaves . INT . KELOID 'S OFFICE  --  DAY Read sits across from Keloid 's desk in Keloid 's office , which seems more like a successful PR executive 's office than a doctor 's . While they talk , Keloid toys with Rose 's file , not really ever looking at it : he is obviously very familiar with its contents , and also in a very distracted frame of mind . &nbsp; KELOIDWell , as you 've seen , Rose is still in some kind of coma , sort of half real coma , half normal deep sleep . Could be weeks before she 's lucid .  --  23  --  &nbsp; READYou do n't know for sure ? &nbsp; KELOIDNo . Her body is still in a state of total shock . She ca n't possibly be moved to a city hospital yet . Her grafts seem to be healing well . We 've been monitoring the internal grafts electronically and there is definitely new tissue growth happening in the abdominal cavity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't know for quite a while . &nbsp; READYou mean if your grafts or whatever they are do n't work , she 'll never eat like a normal human being again . She 'll have to be fed intravenously . &nbsp; KELOIDThat 's right . At the moment , she has only enough small intestine to digest the most basic nutrient material . See  --  the longer the small intestine , the more complex the food that can be broken down and absorbed by the body as food . Cows have lots and lots of intestines so they can eat grass and other vegetable matter . We have medium-length intestines , so we can eat meat and a limited variety of vegetable matter . Vampire bats  --  the real ones , I mean  --  have short intestines , so they eat whole blood , which is very easy to break down and assimilate . Your girlfriend 's in the same boat . &nbsp; READWhat about her brain ? &nbsp; KELOIDHer helmet probably saved her from brain damage , but until she 's fully conscious . . . &nbsp; READYou wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( throwing up his hands ) Hart , what can I tell you ? There 's no magic . Look , I 've done my best . You 're welcome to come here and keep your vigil by Rose 's bedside any time the mood takes you , but please believe me , I will personally telephone you the instant Rose shows even the slightest signs of regaining consciousness . Read sighs , then shrugs with his good shoulder . EXT . CLINIC DRIVEWAY  --  DAY Lloyd Walsh and Read stand in the driveway watching as two orderlies load the burned and smashed hulk of Read 's Norton into the back of Murray Cypher 's Ford station wagon . &nbsp; WALSHJeez , when I saw that thing burning , I never figured I 'd be standing here talking to you a month later . How 's your hand ? &nbsp; READThey 're taking the cage off this afternoon . That 's when I 'll find out . The pin stays in my shoulder for another month , though . Does n't seem to bother me except when it gets damp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a suit jacket and stuffing papers into his attach case at the same time . He walks over to Read and Walsh and opens the door of his car . &nbsp; CYPHER ( to Walsh ) Hi , Lloyd . How ya doin ' ? &nbsp; WALSHGreat . Cypher gets into his car , slams the door , and pops the passenger door open for Read .  --  25  --  &nbsp; CYPHERC'mon , Hart . I got a pack of hungry investors waiting for me . Read gets into the station wagon as the orderlies slam the rear door shut on the Norton . Walsh waves goodbye to Read , who smiles weakly . I hope you 've got some friends who 'll help you unload that pile of junk . I 've got a bad back . What 're you going to do with it ? Use it for an ashtray ?

There are only one or two lights on inside . INT . CLINIC HALL/NIGHT NURSE 'S STATION  --  NIGHT The night nurse checks her watch at her station , which is little more than a desk , chair , and lamp placed at the end of a hall . It 's time for her to make her rounds . She puts down her magazine  --  People  --  and walks down the hall . At the end of it , she disappears down a stairwell .  --  26  --  INT .

The nurse notices that Walsh 's light is on and diffusing out through the crack under the door , but she continues on down the hall . INT . WALSH 'S ROOM  --  NIGHT Walsh is lying in bed reading The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud , which he has borrowed from Judy Glasberg . His room , like all the private rooms at the clinic , is furnished in the style of the plushest , most modern jet-set ski lodges . It 's easy to understand why patients extend their stays beyond what is medically necessary , and just as obvious that the Keloid Clinic management makes no attempt to discourage this home away from home attitude toward the place . Walsh ca n't get comfortable with the book , which he has just started to read . He checks his watch . It 's 1.13 a.m . He 's a little nervous about his operation tomorrow morning .

ANOTHER HALLWAY  --  NIGHT Walsh rounds a corner that leads him past Rose 's door , which still bears its INTENSIVE CARE sign . As he passes by her door , he hears a muffled scream followed by a series of moans and indistinct , angry shouts . Walsh opens her door without hesitation .  --  27  --  INT . ROSE 'S ROOM  --  NIGHT By the light of the full moon and the hallway , Walsh can see Rose thrashing around violently in her bed , getting twisted up in her sheets and ripping out her IV needles . As he watches , one of her IV bottles , pulled off its stand by its feed tube , falls to the floor and smashes to pieces , spilling blood plasma everywhere . Walsh now sees that the floor is littered with shredded bits and pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her various wounds and grafts . The plasma begins to soak into the debris surrounding the bed . Her torso is still covered only by bandages , making her look like a mummy jerking to life in the half-light of her tomb . Walsh rushes over to the bed and quickly lowers the safety railing . He then tries to hold Rose down by the shoulders to keep her from pulling out the last of her IV tubes . When he grabs her by the wrists , he notices that she is oozing blood from where the IV needles have been pulled out . &nbsp; WALSHRosie , Rosie , sweetie , take it easy ! You need that juice , sweetie . It 's keeping you alive . Hey , easy , there . Easy . That 's it . That 's a girl . Under the pressure of Walsh 's body , Rose begins to calm down . Her eyes , which have been open but staring and unseeing , now begin to fill with consciousness . &nbsp; ROSEHart ? What are you . . . what are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . &nbsp; WALSHI 'm not Hart , Rosie . Hart 's back in Montreal waiting for you . I 'm Lloyd .

I guess I was dreaming . Walsh lets go of Rose 's wrists . &nbsp; WALSHI do n't think you were just dreaming . You and Hart were in a really spectacular motorcycle crash . &nbsp; ROSEA crash ? Was there fire ? Was there . . . blood ? &nbsp; WALSHYeah . Plenty of both . You 're bleeding right now . ( getting up ) I 'd better get Dr Keloid . Rose grabs Walsh by the arm and pulls him back down on the bed . &nbsp; ROSENo ! Not yet . I 'm all right . But I 'm freezing cold , and you 're so warm . Hold me . &nbsp; WALSHLook , I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm dying of the cold . Rose puts her arms around Walsh , who hesitates for a moment , then puts his arms around her and hugs her for a moment . Oh , God , that feels so good . Behind Walsh 's back , Rose pulls the last remaining IV needle out of her left wrist . &nbsp; WALSH ( a bit nervous ) Ah , look . . . you do n't even know where you are , do you ?  --  29  --  Rose pulls Walsh 's face down to hers , then slips her arms under his and locks her hands behind his back . &nbsp; ROSESure I do . I 'm here with you . &nbsp; WALSHLook , this is really weird . Are you sure you know what you 're . . . Ow ! Feeling a sudden sharp pain , Walsh tries to pull away . Rose wo n't let him get up . Hey , I think I . . . I think I cut myself or something . You got something sharp in there with you ? Ow ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift himself off the bed , but Rose hangs on to him and comes up with him . Blood is soaking through Walsh 's bathrobe around the right armpit , like dark red sweat . He is moaning and sobbing as he strains to get away . Finally , Walsh collapses on top of Rose , quivering and whimpering . Rose sighs deeply and begins to stroke his head affectionately . Section Details INT . MISS OWEN 'S ROOM AT THE CLINIC  --  EARLY MORNING Miss Beatrice Owen , a tough-looking maiden lady in her fifties , sits on the edge of her bed pulling on a pair of white gloves . She is wearing an immaculate morning outfit which looks vaguely ' 40s and probably is . One of her hands has been twisted by arthritis and puts up quite a struggle before allowing itself to be encased in its glove . She then begins to use her teeth to pull on the other glove . The second glove is only half-way on when Miss Owen hears a desperate scratching and bumping at her door . She stops what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is it ?  --  30  --  After a pause comes more scratching , followed by the sound of a hand feebly slapping on the door . With her second glove still only half on , Miss Owen gets up , goes to the door , and opens it . The instant the door is opened , a ghastly pale Lloyd Walsh slumps heavily across Miss Owen 's shoulders . The force drives her back several steps and she screams with fear . Oh , God save us ! &nbsp; WALSHI 'm sick . I 'm sick . Help me . When she realizes she 's not being attacked , Miss Owen steps back from Walsh , but , unsupported , he starts to fall to the floor . Miss Owen slips her hands up under his arms and guides him unsteadily to the bed . &nbsp; MISS OWENMr Walsh ! What on earth has happened to you ?

When she withdraws her hands from under his arms , Miss Owen finds that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; WALSHI do n't know . I ca n't remember a thing . INT . EXAMINATION ROOM  --  MORNING Keloid and Louise examine Walsh , who lies half-naked on his left side , his right arm stretched out over his head to expose a deep , round , and still-bleeding puncture in his right armpit . Like everything else at the clinic , the examination room has been designed and furnished with luxury and style in mind as much as pure function . Even the cantilevered examination light which Keloid is playing on Walsh 's wound is color-coordinated with the drapes , the chairs , the coat-rack , and the enamel finish of the examination table itself .  --  31  --  &nbsp; KELOIDWere you sleepwalking ? Could you have fallen against something outside and then come back in without waking up ? &nbsp; WALSH ( voice still shaky ) I doubt it . Never done anything like that before . &nbsp; KELOID ( to Louise ) Get me some stuffing , maybe a sponge or two as well . This wound is n't clotting at all . I think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scab to form . &nbsp; LOUISERight away . She leaves , closing the door behind her . Keloid takes a closer look at the wound through a large , illuminated magnifying glass . &nbsp; KELOIDFrom what I can see , it 's a very , very clean and precise wound . You have n't leaned on any picket fences , have you ? Kind with those little spearheads ? &nbsp; WALSH ( unable to respond to Keloid 's attempt at humor ) No . Keloid grunts , takes out a tongue depressor , and begins to probe Walsh 's wound with it . &nbsp; KELOIDDoes this hurt ? &nbsp; WALSHCa n't feel a thing . &nbsp; KELOID ( surprised ) You ca n't ?  --  32  --  &nbsp; WALSHMy whole right side has no feeling in it . Just this aching kind of tingling . &nbsp; KELOIDHm . Louise comes in carrying wads of surgical gauze , sponges , etc . She puts them down and takes Keloid aside . &nbsp; LOUISEDr Keloid ? Kenny Kwong would like to see you . &nbsp; KELOIDRight now ? &nbsp; LOUISEHe says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; KELOID ( confidentially ) OK . Listen . . . our friend here may have had a stroke . I think the General 's the best place for him . But before you plug him up I want 10 cc of blood drawn directly from that wound for tests . Then get Steve to drive him into the city in the ambulance . Tell him to take lots of plasma with him . We 're going to have to forget about the coagulants until the General has a chance to do an ECG on him . &nbsp; LOUISEWill do , Doctor . Keloid leaves . INT . HALLWAY  --  DAY Keloid steps out into the hall and joins Kenny Kwong , the clinic 's senior orderly , a concerned-looking , graying Chinese man of about fifty-five . &nbsp; KWONGCan you come with me , please , Dr Keloid ?  --  33  --  &nbsp; KELOIDSure , Kenny . What 's up ? They begin to walk briskly down the hall , Kenny leading . &nbsp; KWONGYou told me to check around the grounds to see if I could find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find nothing outside . No blood , nothing . Then Nurse Rita call me . She find something . She tell me go get Dr Keloid . You see it , then you tell us what happened .

After a short pause , Rita opens the door and ushers them inside , closing the door behind them . Section Details INT . ROSE 'S ROOM  --  DAY Once inside the door , Keloid is shocked at the state of Rose 's room . It is basically as we last saw it , except that Rita has reattached Rose , who seems to be in a coma once again , to her IV bottles . The area of the wall next to the doorhandle side of the door is smeared with bloody handprints  --  Walsh apparently used the doorknob to pull himself to his feet , then supported himself by holding on to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , while Kwong hangs back to watch that nobody enters inadvertently . &nbsp; RITAWatch your feet , Doctor . The police will probably want every little piece of glass and strip of gauze exactly the way we found it . Keloid finds a place to stand next to the bed , checks Rose 's eyes , then her pulse .  --  34  --  &nbsp; KELOIDWhy do you think the police would be interested in this , Rita ? &nbsp; RITAWhy , it 's perfectly obvious that that Walsh fellow attempted to molest the poor girl while she was still in a coma . I 've seen things like that happen before . Maybe he was drunk . &nbsp; KELOID ( drawing back the sheet ) Hm . Her grafts have taken amazing well . Probably wo n't even have to rebandage . Hm . I ca n't even see any scar tissue . He lifts Rose 's left arm and presses around her armpit . Wow . I 'll have to have a closer look at that . &nbsp; RITARejection problems ? Keloid lowers her arm and covers her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't think so . Seems to be an extreme swelling of the lymph nodes under the arm . Could just be a local infection that 's under attack , but it 's quite a bump . And there 's some kind of lesion there . Does n't seen to be gangrenous , but . . . He walks thoughtfully toward the door . Kwong stands waiting . &nbsp; KWONGWant me to clean up the mess now , Doctor ? &nbsp; KELOID ( snapping out of his train of thought ) What ? Oh , yes . But save all the pieces and scrape some of the dried blood on to a slide . Maybe we 'll find something out .  --  35  --  &nbsp; RITABut Dr Keloid . . . Mr Walsh , he may well be . . . &nbsp; KELOID ( turning to Rita ) Rita , Lloyd Walsh would n't do something like that . He just would n't . And none of this explains how he got his wound .

WHIRLPOOL ROOM  --  NIGHT In the whirlpool room , which contains three full-size whirlpool baths , a bar , and a lounge , Judy Glasberg is taking a midnight whirlpool bath to calm herself down . The room is deserted except for Judy , but she seems to have no trouble adjusting the controls of the bath to get it just right . As Judy plays with the temperature controls , the door behind her opens and someone enters , closing the door behind her . Judy looks up , startled . Rose stands at the door in her fresh clinic gown . For some reason , Judy suddenly feels vulnerable in her skimpy bikini . &nbsp; JUDYRose ? Is that you ? I thought everyone was asleep . They told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( approaching the edge of the bath ) Oh , no . I 'm doing much better now , thank you .  --  36  --  She seems to be completely normal , and as childlike as ever save for the hollows under her eyes .

I mean , I 've never really talked to you before . But I sort of feel I know you , you 've been around here for so long . And I saw them bring you in right after the accident . &nbsp; ROSEDo you mind if I get in with you ? I 've been lying in bed for such a long time , my body aches all over . &nbsp; JUDYAh , well , I . . . does anybody know you 're here ? I mean , does Dr Keloid know you . . . you 've regained consciousness ? Rose climbs into the bath with Judy , gown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be asleep . It was a bit spooky waking up and finding myself all alone . I 'm so glad I ran into you . ( with surprise ) Hey , know what ? I think I can feel the warmth of your body radiating out to me through the water . I 've never felt anything like that before . Judy starts to grope for her towel by the side of the pool . &nbsp; JUDYI think I 'd better get out now . I 'm getting all wrinkly . Rose floats over to Judy and takes her by the arm , interfering with Judy 's attempt to get her towel . &nbsp; ROSEOh , no . Not yet . You have n't even told me your name . &nbsp; JUDYJudy Glasberg . Nice to meet you .  --  37  --  Rose slips her arms up under Judy 's arms and hugs her tightly . &nbsp; ROSEMm . It 's nice to meet you too . Judy tries to gently disengage herself from Rose 's embrace . &nbsp; JUDYOh , now , c'm on . You 're embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a few drinks or something , OK ? When she realizes that Rose is n't going to let her go , Judy starts to struggle more seriously . Let me go , please ! I want to get dressed . Listen , to tell you the truth , I think there 's still something wrong with you . I think you ought to let . . . Ow ! Oh ! Something 's cutting me ! Oh ! It hurts ! She starts to thrash about madly in the water , still locked in Rose 's embrace . They dip under the water , then come up again , Judy gasping for air . Rose lets her move wherever she wants , but keeps her arms locked about Judy , her hands now digging into Judy 's shoulders from behind . In tight close-up we see something joining the two bodies under the arms , from Rose 's left to Judy 's right . Even closer , we see something fleshy slipping in and out of some kind of sheath , barbs cutting through flesh , blood beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the base of the tube , dark green fluid , almost black , begins to flow into the blood drawn up the tube . The mixture of blood and green fluid pumps back and forth in the tube . Judy is now moaning in spasms , her head arched back as far away from Rose as possible , her hair floating in the water behind her and forming spirals in the whirlpool . Rose holds on to Judy for dear life , her eyes closed in ecstasy , her cheeks unnaturally flushed . She does n't notice that Judy 's head is beginning to slip beneath the surface of the water . Judy 's body is wracked by one final spasm , then she relaxes completely , her head  --  38  --  going under completely . The last bubbles of air from her lungs mix with the bubbles spewed out by the whirlpool oxygenator . After a few moments , Rose releases Judy . We see a close-up of the translucent fleshy tube , now empty of blood , sliding back into its sheath . It is only after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices Judy 's face is two inches below the surface of the water , the tip of her nose almost breaking through to the air but not quite . Rose frantically grabs Judy by the hair and pulls her out of the water . Judy is n't breathing . Rose manages to drag Judy to the edge of the pool , clambers out on to the side , then pulls Judy out on to the pool siding with her , Judy trailing a thin trickle of blood in the water behind her . Rose holds Judy 's mouth open and tries to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation , but it 's no good . Judy is dead . Rose shakes her head and starts to cry . &nbsp; ROSEOh , no ! No ! Rose shakes Judy 's corpse hysterically , then collapses across it , sobbing . After a moment , she gets up , visibly fighting for control . She sets her jaw and begins to drag Judy 's body out of the whirlpool room . pp. 1-20 &nbsp; pp. 39-54 INT .

She is determined to get as far away from the clinic as she can by morning light . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . COUNTRY ROAD  --  NIGHT ( APPROX. 4 A.M. ) Rose finds herself walking beside a moonlit field with a ramshackle barn at one end . She pauses beside the barn for a moment , then slips under the fence surrounding the field and makes her way gingerly across the muddy barnyard toward the door of the barn . The house nearest the barn is dark . Rose gently edges open the door of the barn . INT . BARN  --  NIGHT Once inside the barn , Rose feels around for a light switch . She finds it without much trouble and flicks it on . The barn is low and full of cobwebs , and houses only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nest of straw that the two cows have made , and gradually snuggles her way in between them . She starts to stroke the side of one of the cows , getting the animal accustomed to her touch , at the same time carefully slipping out of her windbreaker . She then raises her left arm and presses her left armpit flat against the cow 's side . After a pause , she gives a short , sharp push with her left side , as though she 's pushing something into the cow with her body . The cow responds by lifting up its head and turning to look at her . Satisfied that nothing too threatening is happening , it turns back and lowers its head again . Rose stretches out over the cow in ecstasy . Her eyes are closed . Blood begins to flow in a rapid , one-way stream from the cow into Rose . She is breathing rapidly and heavily . Suddenly , she pulls away from the cow , giving us a chance to see a flash of some kind of elongated , tube-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tip . As Rose lurches to her feet , we can see a small , deep wound leaking blood and green , bile-like fluid in the cow 's side where Rose 's  --  44  --  armpit had been pressed . The cows stir in reaction to Rose 's violent movement . She staggers away from the cows , dizzy and nauseous . She manages to reach the stalls , which she leans on for support , before she begins to vomit . Suddenly , the door bangs open and a drunken old farmer stumbles into the barn , a whisky bottle in his hand . &nbsp; FARMERAll right , you ! Hold it right there ! ( spotting Rose ) Oh . Whatta we got here ? Hello , sweet honey pie . What 're ya drinkin ' ? You come in to get outta the cold ?

The farmer is slobbering happily around Rose 's shoulder when she suddenly grabs his head by the hair with both her hands and pulls him viciously down on the cutting points of her bloodsucking organ . The farmer screams in agony . Rose holds the farmer 's head down until he stops screaming and starts breathing heavily , spasmodically . Then she lets him go . The farmer straightens up .

INT . CYPHER 'S LIVING ROOM IN DORVAL  --  NIGHT A groggy Murray Cypher sits on a sofa in front of the TV set in his living room , trying to get his four-month-old son to drink his 6 a.m. bottle . The images of the early morning show  --  the sound has been turned off  --  seem to attract the baby more than the bottle does . To Cypher 's complete surprise , the telephone starts to ring . &nbsp; CYPHEROh , no . I just do n't believe it . OK , Jeffrey  --  you 're on your own for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two cushions , but he starts to cry the instant Cypher lets go of him .

He takes a close look at one of the pictures of himself and Rose on the Norton . INT . ROSE 'S ROOM AT THE CLINIC  --  NIGHT Rose sits quietly on the edge of her bed , her feet dangling over the side not quite touching the floor . She keeps her head down and does not look at Keloid , who is conferring with Rita at the door . Rita has given Rose a new gown and cleaned her up a bit for Keloid . Rita leaves and Keloid closes the door behind her . He turns to Rose and approaches the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't say anything until he sits down on the bed beside her . &nbsp; KELOIDRose . . . I 'm Dr Keloid . Dan Keloid . I 'm here to help you , sweetheart . Rose lifts her head to look at Keloid for the first time . Tears are streaming down her cheeks . She throws her arms around Keloid and  --  50  --  begins to sob on his shoulder . Keloid hugs her gently and pets her on the head as though she were a child . After one or two moments , Keloid detaches himself from Rose and lies her back down on her bed . Rose , we wo n't talk about anything right now except how you 're feeling , OK ? Rose nods , still snuffling slightly . Good . First thing I want to do is to check out some of the skin grafts we did for you . Now , could you please just slip your arm out of your left shoulder strap and raise your arm over your head ? Instead of doing as Keloid asks , Rose puts her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is baffled . What 's the matter , Rose ? Are you in pain ? Talk to me , Rose . It 's the only way I can understand what 's bothering you . &nbsp; ROSE ( from behind her hands ) I 'm hideous , Doctor . I 'm crazy and I 'm a monster . &nbsp; KELOIDC'mon , Rose . There 's just about nothing we ca n't fix if we know what 's wrong . Now , I do n't want any more games . Do what I tell you . Rose reluctantly takes her hands away from her face and slips her left arm out of its shoulder strap . A pause , and then she raises her left arm above her head on the pillow . Keloid can barely suppress his surprise at what he sees . Nestled in Rose 's left armpit is a fleshy , tubular lump with an opening at the upper end of it . Keloid reaches over and presses it gently with his fingertips . Does that hurt ?  --  51  --  &nbsp; ROSENo . It does n't hurt . Keloid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening at the upper end seems to be surrounded by sphincter muscles . Keloid gently spreads the opening with his thumb . Deep within the pouch , something an angry pink color , something glistening , seems to be pulsating . When he removes his thumb , the muscles pull the opening closed again the way a drawstring closes a bag . Keloid sits up on the side of the bed again , trying to regain his composure . &nbsp; KELOID ( after a pause ) As far as I can tell now , it 'll take just a very minor operation to remove that growth from under your arm . It may be some kind of external intestinal tissue . The neutral field tissue graft we did has been trying to find a way to get food that you can digest into your body . I was hoping it would do that by providing you with a regular set of small intestines but it seems to have had something different in mind . Rose shakes her head . A baffled expression comes over Keloid 's face . How long have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ROSECouple of days . &nbsp; KELOIDDo you feel weak ? &nbsp; ROSEI feel strong . I feel very strong . &nbsp; KELOIDRita tells me you refused to let her attach you to your intravenous nutrient bottles . Why ? &nbsp; ROSEI do n't need them . They make me feel sick .  --  52  --  &nbsp; KELOIDI do n't understand . They 've got to be your only source of food . &nbsp; ROSEThey 're not . They have n't been for a couple of days . Not since that man . . . &nbsp; KELOIDMan ? What are you talking about ? &nbsp; ROSEI 'll show you . Rose puts her right hand behind Keloid 's head and draws it slowly down toward her left armpit . When Keloid 's head is about a foot and a half away from the organ , Rose grabs Keloid by the hair with both hands and strains upwards with her body . Keloid emits a low , gurgling scream which soon cuts off with the suddenness of a thrown switch . Exhausted of energy , Keloid collapses across Rose , who begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps the blood from his body . Section Details EXT . KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN DEPOT  --  MORNING ( 6.45 A.M. ) A battered old Ford pick-up truck pulls into the parking lot of a Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken depot beside the two-lane highway leading to the Keloid Clinic . The door of the truck opens and a vaguely familiar mangy dog jumps out : it belongs to the farmer who was Rose 's third victim . INT . FRIED CHICKEN DEPOT  --  MORNING The farmer enters the take-out depot , which is deserted except for staff and one lone trucker . The farmer is wearing a pair of crooked and cracked sunglasses . He is not very steady on his feet . His dog watches with concern through the glass door . &nbsp; FARMER ( to counter girl ) One bucket of your best for me and my dog there .  --  53  --  &nbsp; COUNTER GIRLYes , sir .

Ca n't remember too good . The man in the kitchen slaps a bucket of chicken down on the kitchen-window counter . &nbsp; KITCHEN MANOne bucket ready to go . The counter girl picks up the bucket and carries it over to the trucker . She has just barely put it down when the farmer grabs it and starts tearing the lid from it . &nbsp; TRUCKERHey , Buddy . I think that one 's mine . The farmer grabs a piece of fried chicken from the bucket and starts wolfing it down . The trucker puts his hand on the farmer 's shoulder and turns him around so that they face each other , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said . . .

To his disgust , he is confronted with one closed , sollen , and bleeding eye , and one eye which has almost completely clouded over from white of eye to pupil . What the hell . . . Bits of chicken drool from the farmer 's mouth , followed by a froth of dark green foam . Without warning , the farmer lunges at the trucker and tries to bite his face . The trucker dodges out of the way , catches the farmer by his jacket and swings him over the counter , where he crashes into the counter girl . As the kitchen man comes out of the kitchen with a pot of boiling oil in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the arm before she can pull away . Green foam dribbles into the girl 's wound . Once the girl has pulled loose and backs away , screaming hysterically , the kitchen man throws the potful of oil on the farmer as he struggles to his feet . The farmer screams . As the dog barks madly at the door , the trucker and the kitchen man jump on the farmer and pound him senseless behind the counter . pp. 21-38 &nbsp; pp. 55-76 INT .

The 8 a.m. news is in progress . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER ( V.O. ) . . . but there can be little doubt that the issue of police brutality will still be with us for some time to come .

He makes two more cuts and rolls back a flap of skin . Everything seems to be under control . INT . STATION WAGON  --  MORNING Cypher and Read drive on , listening to the rest of the news story . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER ( V.O. ) The man , later identified as forty-three-year-old Fred Atkins of Camelford , went berserk this morning during an argument over who was to be served his bucket of chicken first and bit the counter girl on the arm .

And now , a brief pause for station identification , after which we 'll talk to a scientist who says that earthquakes may one day become a thing of the past . . . While they listen to a variation of the Radio Shack commercial , Cypher notices that they 're passing by the Kentucky Fried Chicken depot . There are still two police cars parked in the parking lot . &nbsp; CYPHERHey , we 're right there . &nbsp; READ ( drowsy ) Huh ? &nbsp; CYPHERThe place they were talking about on the radio . ( joking ) Wan na stop off for some fried chicken ?  --  57  --  &nbsp; READ ( not reacting to the joke ) Not hungry , thanks .

Roxanne 's brow is furrowed as she reaches for the scissors on her instrument tray and hands them to Keloid . &nbsp; DR . ROXANNE KELOIDScissors . Instead of simply allowing the scissors to be placed in his hand , Keloid grabs Roxanne by the wrist with one hand and takes the scissors with the other . He turns to look at her . She is shocked to see that his eyes have completely clouded over . Looking into them is like looking down two dark holes . Dan . . . ! Without hesitation , Keloid takes the scissors and cuts the tip of Roxanne 's index finger off . Roxanne stares down at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her throat . Keloid lets the scissors drop to the floor and pulls down his mask . Dark green fluid foams from his mouth .

Louise , who turned to look at Keloid at the sound of the falling scissors , screams in unison , backing away in terror and disbelief . The operating room explodes in confusion and panic as Keloid and Roxanne start to thrash about , knocking instruments and various surgical appliances to the floor . The patient slumbers on , oblivious . Dr Karl , the anesthetist , leaves his post behind the patient 's head and tries to pull Keloid off Roxanne . &nbsp; KARLDan , do n't be stupid !

PATIENTS ' LOUNGE  --  MORNING Rose is sitting in the patients ' lounge with one or two other patients , watching TV . Next to Rose is a mobile intravenous cart , to whose three bottles she is attached by several IV tubes . A young nurse we have not seen previously sits beside her , obviously instructed to keep a close watch on Rose , who wears a clinic dressing-gown over her nightgown . Suddenly Louise comes flying past the lounge in hysterics , half crying , half screaming . &nbsp; LOUISE ( hysterical ) He 's gone crazy , he 's gone crazy ! He 's killing everybody ! There 's blood everywhere ! We 've got to do something !  --  59  --  We 've got to get the police !

SIDE HALLWAY  --  MORNING Once she is out of sight , Rose quickly begins to detach herself from her IV tubes . Shouts and sounds of struggle rise and fall in the distance as she pulls the needles out of her wrists . INT .

The cop points to the mesh windows in the wagon 's rear doors . &nbsp; COPBy that . Cypher looks through the mesh . Without warning , Keloid throws himself against the mesh from the inside , frothing green at the mouth , smeared with blood and moaning like a creature from hell . He tries savagely to bite Cypher through the wire , which cuts his lips and scrapes the enamel from his teeth . Cypher jumps back .

MONTREAL TRUCK DEPOT  --  NIGHT At a Montreal truck depot , crates are being unloaded from a warehouse and on to a series of trucks .

We got ta get this rig movin ' . The dispatcher slides the door open . Eddy screams the second the light hits him and jumps out at the dispatcher , eyes clouded over , foaming mouth wide open . The dispatcher is bowled over by the force of the impact and he falls backwards to the concrete , Eddy all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . In an instant five loaders are trying to pull Eddy away . Eddy immediately turns on them , managing to inflict several bites before he disappears beneath the ever-increasing mass of loaders and truckers trying to get at him . Section Details INT . MINDY 'S APARTMENT  --  NIGHT Mindy is watching TV in her cramped one-bedroom downtown high-rise apartment . Mindy is twenty-one , has lived on her own for years , is on the plump side of voluptuous , and works for IBM selling office equipment . As she watches her color portable , Mindy idly turns the pages of Vogue magazine , smokes a cigarette , and alternately sips a cognac and a black coffee . There is a special newscast concerning the alleged rabies outbreak in the clinic region , complete with documentary footage shot outside the quarantined QPP station . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER. . . and health officials have said they consider the outbreak of the new strain of rabies as being potentially the worst of this century. At the police station in Camelford , Kathy Draper talked to Quebec Bureau of Health official Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 station and ends up in a close-up of Mr Lapointe , standing in front of his van .  --  71  --  &nbsp; LAPOINTECertainly this is serious . This is not just a question of swine flu or something like that . We have already several deaths on our hands in this one small area alone , and the main problem is . . . we do n't know what we 're up against . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) Are you saying that this is not an outbreak of rabies ? &nbsp; LAPOINTEI 'm not saying that . I 'm not saying that , exactly . But it must be a new strain of rabies , because there are symptoms involved which we and even the world health community do not seem to be familiar with . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) What are these symptoms ? &nbsp; LAPOINTEWell , the period of incubation of this disease is very brief , maybe six to eight hours at the most . Now , that 's quick , much quicker than normal rabies . Then the victim begins to sweat , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so rare . What is rare is that the victim always with this new disease becomes violent and wants to bite somebody new . And this crazy phase is followed by a coma and then , in every case we know , by death . It 's very strange . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) What advice would you give to our viewers ? &nbsp; LAPOINTEThe disease spreads through the saliva of the victim . . . the saliva is very contagious . It dribbles into open wounds and cuts and causes immediate infection . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) So ? &nbsp; LAPOINTE ( shrugging ) So . . . do n't let anybody bite you . And if somebody does ,  --  72  --  find a doctor who can give you rabies shots immediately . We are already setting up vaccination centers beginning right here and spreading out toward Montreal . If we do n't keep the disease localized and out of large centers of population , well . . . I would n't like to say what it could be like . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we went on the air . Is that what you mean by . . . ? &nbsp; LAPOINTE ( laughing ) We sometimes like to be dramatic about these things . It 's more interesting than the usual paperwork and we get . . . you know . . . we get excited . It 's a real challenge . . . There is a knock at the door . Mindy gets up and opens it . Standing in the corridor is Rose . &nbsp; ROSESurprise . I 'm amongst the living . Mindy throws her arms around Rose , hugs her , and pulls her inside the door . They separate , then hug again , both of them on the verge of tears . INT . CAMELFORD STATION CELL  --  NIGHT Cypher and Read are sharing an open cell at the QPP station , which has been made as homely as possibly by the addition of two chairs and a small table , which Cypher is using as a desk . Read lies back on the lower half of one of the cell 's three double bunk beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maze of papers of all sizes and shapes . &nbsp; READGot anything in there I might want to read ? I 'm starting to go stir crazy already . &nbsp; CYPHERIt 's actually pretty exciting stuff if you know how to interpret it .  --  73  --  Cypher throws down his Audit Point pen , leans back , and puts his feet up on the table . I guess I 'm just going on automatic pilot right now . ( shakes his head ) I ca n't connect that creature I saw in the paddy wagon with Danny . I just ca n't believe they 're all dead . . . Read is on the verge of saying something when they are both startled by the sound of a sudden chase in the main office at the end of the row of cells . Screams and yells are punctuated by the crash of overturned furniture and smashing glass . Read and Cypher barely have time to get to their feet when they see the head cop backing slowly through the door leading to the main office , his service revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you understand what I 'm saying ? Stay back ! Sit on the floor and put your hands on your head . When the cop is about a third of the way down the aisle between the rows of cells , Read steps out behind him . The cop does n't take his eyes away from the doorway . &nbsp; READWhat 's going on ? &nbsp; COPGet into the cell and be ready to lock yourselves in . Do what I tell you ! Before Read has a chance to move , a second cop appears , sweating , staggering , drooling green foam , eyes expressionless black holes . The infected cop is stalking the head cop . Somebody shouts from somewhere back in the main office . &nbsp; VOICEGet out of the line of fire , Ted . We 'll take him from here with the scatterguns.  --  74  --  &nbsp; COP ( shouting back ) Gim me a count of three , Joe ! I 'll be outta your way by three ! &nbsp; VOICEOne . . . ! The head cop draws even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already backed into it and flattened himself against the wall opposite the aisle . The infected cop comes closer . Cypher notices the bandage on his hand , then recognizes him as the cop at the clinic entrance who was bitten by Keloid and got rabies shots immediately afterwards . Two . . . ! &nbsp; COP ( to Read and Cypher ) Gim me room . I 'm coming in quick . &nbsp; VOICEThree . . . ! The head cop dives sideways into the cell . The infected cop lunges forwards after him and is half-way through the cell door when Read , hanging on to the bars of the cell for leverage , puts his foot in the cop 's stomach and kicks him back out into the line of fire . Before the infected cop can regain his balance , he is punched to the floor by several shotgun blasts . By the time the guns stop firing , the infected cop 's body has been pushed almost to the end of the aisle . The head cop steps out to meet the three cops from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting up from the barrels of their guns . &nbsp; COP ( to nobody in particular ) They gave him rabies shots . He got bitten up at that facelift place and they gave him his shots right away . The head cop turns away from the body and looks up at the three men from the main office .  --  75  --  They did n't do him any damn good , did they ? Read and Cypher exchange glances . It 's been a lousy day . INT . MINDY 'S LIVING ROOM  --  NIGHT Mindy and Rose are sitting in Mindy 's living room , Rose in front of the TV on the sofa , Mindy at a small desk in the corner with papers and some sort of training manual spread out in front of her . Rose is watching TV with a long ear plug trailing from the silent TV set across three feet of rug , up the sofa , and into her left ear . Rose is watching Shivers , starring Paul Hampton , Joe Silver , and Barbara Steele , and is getting very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is eating a ham sandwich while she works . Mindy has her hair pulled back and the pulse in her neck is somehow very prominent . Rose pulls the plug out of her ear , turns off the TV set , stands up , and goes to the closet next to the front door . Mindy looks up from her work for the first time . &nbsp; MINDYWhat are you doing , Rose ? &nbsp; ROSE ( putting on her jacket ) I think I have to go out for a while . Mindy gets up and joins Rose at the door . &nbsp; MINDYRosie , I feel so stupid . I have n't been much of a hostess . Why do n't you stay here ? There must be something in the fridge I can tempt you with . &nbsp; ROSE ( opening the door ) Thanks , Mindy , but it 's not that . I just have to get out into the fresh air again . It 's a real experience for me just to walk down a street . &nbsp; MINDYI 'll come with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work . I wo n't be gone too long . &nbsp; MINDYOK , Rosie . If you get dizzy or anything , call me . Rose laughs , pats Mindy on the cheek , and leaves . pp. 39-54 &nbsp; pp. 77-93 EXT . ST . CATHERINE 'S STREET  --  NIGHT Rose walks down the most crowded part of St. Catherine 's Street she can find . She has a new sensitivity to the heat radiating from the bodies of those close to her , and the presence of so much warm , jostling flesh full of blood whose coursing she can almost hear soon makes her eyes shine , her nostrils flare , her steps quick and precise . Rose soon finds herself standing in front of an Eve Cinema , which is showing two soft-core skin flicks , as usual . On an impulse , Rose digs around in the pockets of Judy Glasberg 's jeans . In the back pocket she finds a five-dollar bill . She hesitates for only a moment , then buys a ticket and enters the cinema . INT . EVE CINEMA  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of an empty row of seats not far from the screen and its murky orgiastics . It is not long before a thirtyish , balding man leaves his seat at the back of the cinema and sits directly behind Rose . As he removes his jacket , he brushes against Rose 's hair with his hand as though by accident . Rose turns around to look at him . &nbsp; BALDING MAN'Scuse me . I did n't mean to touch you . Rose gives him a hard look , then turns around to face the screen again . Well , pardon me for existing . Rose turns around again .  --  77  --  &nbsp; ROSEI thought you did it on purpose . &nbsp; BALDING MANNo . Really . I was taking my jacket off and it brushed against you . &nbsp; ROSEOh , well , I 'm sorry . I like seeing these movies but men are always bothering me . I guess I 'm a little paranoid . &nbsp; BALDING MANWell , look . If I come and sit beside you everybody will think we 're together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I ask is a couple handfuls of popcorn . &nbsp; ROSE ( laughing ) OK . C'm on . The balding man gets up , moves to the end of his aisle , then makes his way toward Rose , trying not to blow it by betraying his excitement . He sits down beside Rose . She offers him some popcorn . DISSOLVE TO : EXT . EVE CINEMA EXIT  --  NIGHT Rose slips out of the side exit of the cinema into an alley , her cheeks flushed , her breathing heavy . Crowds of people still throng past the opening at the end of the alley , the night just beginning . Rose watches them move past as though still watching a movie , feeling the full weight of her separation from the ordinary . After a pause , she moves out to join it . INT .

Section Details INT . MINDY 'S LIVING ROOM  --  MORNING Mindy is preparing and eating her breakfast of bran muffins , coffee , and orange juice on the run . While she shuffles her coffee cup and her notebooks , she listens to the radio . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER ( V.O. ) . . . decide that each municipality should take on the responsibility for setting up vaccination centers in community halls and health clinics . Police have criticized the City Hall decision , saying that evidence has come to light which indicates that normal rabies vaccine is completely ineffective against the new strain of the disease . They are asking instead for the organization of a series of militia-and army-controlled quarantine centers until such time as an effective vaccine is developed . Said one police spokesman : We are having trouble containing the known outbreaks of violence induced by the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads through the city like a normal wave of the flu. Mindy has finally gotten herself ready to go to work . Just before she leaves , she knocks on the bathroom door . &nbsp; MINDYI 'm going , Rosie . I 've left you some coffee on the stove . Turn it off if you go out , OK ? &nbsp; ROSE ( O.S. ) OK . ' Bye . &nbsp; MINDY ( slightly worried pause ) Are n't you going to wish me luck ? ( pause ) Are you OK ?  --  79  --  &nbsp; ROSE ( O.S. ) ( oddly muffled ) Brushing my teeth . Good luck . &nbsp; MINDY ( relaxing ) Thanks . See you later . Mindy turns to the front door , opens it , and leaves . INT . MINDY 'S BATHROOM  --  MORNING In the bathroom , Rose is doubled over on the floor clutching her stomach . Two seconds after she hears the front door slam closed , she lets out a low , strangled moan and begins to roll around on the floor . A sudden spasm forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking into the palms of her hands . After the spasm passes , she props herself up against the bathroom door . A thread of blood curls down her wrist . She opens her right hand . She stares at the four tiny crescents of blood that her nails have cut into her palm . With slow , trancelike motions , she licks the blood off her wrist and her palm . INT . SUBWAY STATION  --  MORNING Mindy stands in a crowded subway station waiting for her train to come . Every once in a while she glances down at a marked page in a blue corporation manual she 's carrying , checking her memory against the printed specifications of various pieces of office equipment . The train finally comes and Mindy gets crammed in with the rest of the rush-hour crowd . INT . SUBWAY CAR  --  MORNING As the subway car pulls out of the station , Mindy leans against the door and continues to consult her manual . As she looks up and off into space , trying to grasp the next set of machine specifications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her back against the opposite door . The woman seems to be blind  --  her eyes are completely black from edge to edge .  --  80  --  Then Mindy notices with horror that the woman is trembling and drooling and foaming green at the mouth . The sea of faces between them seems indifferent to the woman until she screams at the top of her lungs and plunges forward with her mouth wide open , apparently trying to get at Mindy . The people closest to the woman suddenly start to panic , and the panic moves out through the car in waves . Everyone starts to push and shove , and people try to climb over one another . The infected woman manages to lock her teeth on to the ear of a man who begins to punch her in the chest and stomach , himself completely terrified . The subway car pulls into the next station and its doors open . Mindy is almost knocked to the platform and trampled but she manages to stay on her feet and flow with the stampede .

DOWNTOWN CONSTRUCTION SITE  --  DAY Mr Lapointe , Quebec Health Bureau official , is riding in the back of a city limousine with an official from the mayor 's office . The limousine is working its way through the rubble of a deserted construction site . &nbsp; LAPOINTE ( exasperated ) You 'll pardon me , Mr Stasiuk , but I think the mayor should be taking this epidemic more seriously than he is . &nbsp; OFFICIALA city is a complex machine , Mr Lapointe . Every part needs constant attention . The mayor will listen to you , but you 're not the only one . It takes time . . . The limousine has worked its way into a relatively deserted section of the site , and now slows to a stop .

Well , is n't there anyone around ? Do we have to turn around ? Before anyone can make a move , two construction workers suddenly emerge from the surrounding rubble and advance on the car , one of them carrying a pneumatic jackhammer . Clark . . . roll down your window and ask them why the road is blocked . It may be strike trouble . Be careful . Clark is in the process of rolling down his window when the man with the jackhammer turns on the hammer and applies the chisel to the driver 's door . As the chisel point of the hammer chews up the door , Lapointe can see that the eyes of the two workers are clouded over and that they are all slavering green foam from their mouths . Oh , Christ ! Clark , let 's get out quick ! Quick , man ! &nbsp; LAPOINTEThey 've got the disease ! Look at their eyes ! Report that to your mayor ! Before the driver can slam the limousine into reverse , the second infected worker has reached through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer has completely penetrated the door . The driver screams . They 'll kill us ! The two workers begin to drag the screaming driver out of the car . The official scrambles over the front seatbacks into the driver 's seat , kicks the legs of the driver away from the foot controls , and slams the gearshift into reverse . The limousine fishtails backwards madly as the official floors the accelerator , the crumpled , bloodied driver 's door flapping like a broken wing as the car backs down the road . In the rapidly receding distance , Lapointe can see the infected workers hunching over Clark 's body .  --  82  --  INT . SHOPPING MALL  --  DAY Rose sits in the middle of a shopping mall full of early Christmas shoppers . Her hair is matted and straggly and she watches the people in the mall hungrily . In the background , children line up to sit on the knee of a huge , enthroned Santa Claus surrounded by elaborately wrapped presents and Christmas trees attached to a huge backdrop of crimson and tinsel . Two cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older cop , watch the proceedings tensely . Large crowds always mean trouble . The two cops patrol the mall separately , keeping in touch by radio . A pleasant young man stops in front of Rose 's bench , looks her over , then decides to get acquainted . &nbsp; YOUNG MAN ( to Rose ) Mind if I sit down ? &nbsp; ROSENo . I do n't mind . The young man sits down . &nbsp; YOUNG MANNothing like Christmas , huh ? Rose does n't answer . The young man is running out of opening lines . Ah . . . you smoke ? You know . . . cigarettes ? You smoke ? &nbsp; ROSEYeah . Sure . &nbsp; YOUNG MANGreat . Have one of mine . The young man fumbles in his jacket pocket for his pack of cigarettes , then awkwardly shakes one out of the pack for Rose . She takes it . The young man puts one in his mouth , then starts to feel around in his pockets for matches . He ca n't find any . No matches . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . The young man looks around . He spots a man with a cigarette in his hand at the end of the adjacent bench . He gets up . Just a sec . I 'll ask that guy over there for a light . OK ? Be right back . He walks over to the man on the bench . As he approaches , he notices that the man 's cigarette has burned right down to the flesh of his fingers . ' Scuse me , Mac . Got ta light ? Without warning , the man on the bench leaps up at the young man and grabs him by the hair . The man , a powerful , bearded man of about sixty , has eyes like black holes and is drooling green foam . He pulls the young man 's head back and begins to tear at his throat with nicotine-stained teeth . The young man screams . The two cops break into a run the instant they locate the source of the screams .

He 'll kill you ! That man 'll kill you ! The children around the Santa Claus display scatter as the bearded man heads for them . The Santa Claus stands up and grabs at the bearded man just as the young cop opens fire with his submachine-gun . His bullets rip through both men and the entire display , scattering bits of Christmas wrapping and plastic fir trees everywhere .

CAMELFORD STATION  --  DAY We are close on a TV set sitting on the admitting sergeant 's desk just inside the station 's main entrance . A detailed analysis of the disease crisis is in the process of being broadcast , complete with news footage of army and militiamen jumping off trucks in Place Ville Marie , citizens being vaccinated at community health centers and at emergency depots set up in subway stations , etc . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER ( V.O. ) . . . and the crisis has now been officially granted epidemic status by officials of the World Health Organization . The Prime Minister was reluctant to officially declare a state of emergency , but as any citizen in the streets can tell you , martial law has come to Montreal . At an emergency vaccination center set up in the Atwater Metro Station , we spoke with a director of the World Health Organization who had just arrived from England to take charge of liaison with Health Bureaus in Western European countries . The face of an aristocratic and very tweedy Englishman appears on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WHO , flashing beneath his face on the screen for a moment or two . &nbsp; GENTRYI do n't think there 's any question that martial law is needed in the city of Montreal at this point in time . It 's a necessity . It has already been established that victims of the disease  --  and it is not rabies , though it may be related to the rabies virus  --  victims of the disease are beyond medical help once it has established itself to the degree of inducing violent behavior . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( O.C. ) What you 're saying , then , Dr Gentry , is that . . .  --  85  --  &nbsp; GENTRYWhat I 'm saying is very simple . It may not be very palatable for your viewers . Shooting down victims of the disease is as good a way of handling them as we 've got . If we lock them up , they immediately go into a coma and die shortly afterwards . We 've now got a vaccine that we think will work in a preventative way , but for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we know , there 's no hope for them . The face of Dr Gentry is replaced by a close-up of a needle sinking into an arm . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER ( V.O. ) All those receiving shots of the new vaccine are being issued plastic ID cards with a photo of the card holder . Viewers are urged not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary , and are reminded that if they do they must carry their vaccine cards with them . Police , army , and militia officers may demand to see them . Here is a list of vaccination centers in your area and the toll-free telephone number of our special emergency information center . Read and Cypher , rumpled and haggard , are signing forms at the main desk of the station prior to being released . Both are wearing plastic vaccination plates on their jackets , Read toying impatiently with his . &nbsp; CYPHER ( to desk sergeant ) Goodbye , Sergeant .

We hear the sound of Mindy walking through her living room , then approaching the bedroom . Rose ? Are you asleep ? Mindy enters the bedroom , a bag of groceries in her arms . She stops at the door , shocked at Rose 's appearance , then puts the bag down on her night table and sits on the bed beside Rose .  --  87  --  &nbsp; MINDYHave you been out ? Have you gotten your shot ? Rose rolls over to face Mindy . Her lips are pale and parched , her nose is running , her voice shakes as she speaks . &nbsp; ROSE ( feebly ) I . . .

EXPRESSWAY RAMP  --  DUSK Read and Cypher descend into the city on a long expressway ramp which affords them a clear view of other sections of highway and a large suburban plaza dominated by a huge supermarket . Both their ramp and the other sections of highway are strewn with wrecked and burned-out cars and even the occasional body . As the station wagon descends , they can see the line-up of people moving in and out of the supermarket guarded by soldiers with light machine-guns .

EXT . ANOTHER STREET  --  NIGHT The station wagon turns on to a long , broad , practically deserted street . The only human activity is centered around a convoy of heavy white city garbage trucks manned by white-uniformed , hooded figures . The convoy of twelve is led by a military jeep whose rider , an army sergeant , orders them to peel off one by one down specific routes deemed primary for decontamination . Armed soldiers ride on the tops of the trucks carrying rifles with telescopic sights . INT . STATION WAGON  --  NIGHT &nbsp; READI ca n't believe it .

Maybe you should bring Rose back here with you until this thing blows over . &nbsp; READYeah . Listen , thanks for the car , Murray . I 'll call you .

Cypher lets the lid drop down with a mixture of fear and horror suddenly stabbing him in the pit of the stomach . An insane kind of moaning giggle drifts over to him from the corner of the room . He whirls to face the sound . It seems to be coming from the closet . Drawn inexorably toward the sound , he approaches the closet , which is not completely closed . He raises his hand to grasp the doorknob . Without warning , the closet door explodes open , smashing Cypher in the face and knocking him to the floor .

MINDY 'S KITCHEN  --  NIGHT In her kitchen , Mindy continues preparing an elaborate vegetable stew , somehow convinced that her weeks in the hospital have induced in Rose an aversion to meat . The TV set , Mindy 's constant companion , has been turned around so that Mindy can just see it from where she 's working , although the sound has been turned off in deference to Rose . At the moment there seems to be a detailed analysis of the difference between rabies and the new strain of disease holding the city in thrall , complete with microphotography , in progress .  --  91  --  INT .

DOWNTOWN STREET  --  NIGHT Read drives Cypher 's station wagon along a downtown street on his way to Mindy 's . There are more people on this particular street than the ones he and Cypher first encountered . In fact , were it not for the heavily armed soldiers placed at several strategic points and the single guarded garbage truck making its rounds , all would seem normal . The sound of sporadic gunfire in the distance seems to have been accepted as everyday fare by everybody . But Read 's focus of attention is on the car radio . He has been listening to an analysis of the possible origins of the disease and the information he 's getting is disturbing him . The voice on the radio is that of Dr Royce Gentry . &nbsp; GENTRY ( V.O. ) And so after using some rather elaborate tracking procedures and applying them to a map , we find that the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of origin . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( V.O. ) Which is . . . ? &nbsp; GENTRY ( V.O. ) Which is the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic Surgery , a few miles outside the town of Camelford . You can see with your own eyes how everything has spread out from there in geometrically increasing proportions . Now this pattern , in conjunction with some of our other statistics , indicates that there is a strong possibility that there is a special factor at work in the spread of the disease . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( V.O. ) You mean a carrier .  --  92  --  &nbsp; GENTRY ( V.O. ) Well , at the risk of setting off a futile witch hunt . . . Yes . Someone like the infamous Typhoid Mary who incubates the disease and transmits it , but is herself immune to it . &nbsp; INTERVIEWER ( V.O. ) What were they doing at the Keloid Clinic , Dr Gentry ? &nbsp; GENTRY ( V.O. ) We 've run into a certain amount of difficulty ascertaining what exactly was going on there . We know what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the like . . . no secret government contracts . . . Read 's concentration is suddenly shattered by a movement he catches in the corner of his rear-view mirror as he waits for a light to change . A crazy  --  a man in his forties wearing a scarf and gloves but no coat  --  breaks out from between two buildings just behind Read 's car and heads for the clusters of people crossing at the light . Read watches the man brush by the car as though watching the scene on television . The people in the crosswalk scatter at the crazy 's approach . The sniper on top of the garbage truck has him safely in his crosshairs and squeezes off a shot . The crazy hurtles against the hood of the station wagon as though falling from a building and bounces off and on to the road . Before Read can drive off , two garbage men run toward him from the garbage truck . One of them holds up his hand for Read to wait . He produces a spray bottle from under his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car 's hood . Then he waves Read on . Read puts his windshield wipers on . INT . MINDY 'S APARTMENT  --  NIGHT Rose is dressed and trying to steal out the front door when Mindy hears her from the kitchen . &nbsp; MINDY ( O.S. ) Rose ? Are you awake ? Rose yanks open the door and has one foot out the door when  --  93  --  Mindy appears around the corner with a dish of sauce in her hand . &nbsp; MINDYOh , no . Rose ! You ca n't ! It 's dangerous out there ! Mindy bangs the plate down on top of a stereo speaker and runs after Rose . She catches her a few steps out the door and hauls her back inside , swinging the door shut again with her foot . The door does n't lock . Rose is whimpering and weak . She starts to sink to the floor , and Mindy , not strong enough to hold her up , goes with her . &nbsp; ROSEMindy , Mindy . I do n't want it to be you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MINDYOf course it should be me . Who else but your best friend , Rose ? I 'll take care of you . &nbsp; ROSE ( pause ) Oh , Mindy , I ache all over . I 'm hurting from the inside out . &nbsp; MINDYWell then , what you need is a nice , deep , hot bath . It 'll seep in and relax you from the outside in . She starts to unbutton Rose 's shirt . Rose does n't resist . pp. 55-76 &nbsp; pp. 94-100 EXT . MINDY 'S APARTMENT BUILDING  --  NIGHT Read parks the station wagon in front of Mindy 's building and gets out . He sprints up the front steps . INT . APARTMENT CORRIDOR  --  NIGHT Read emerges from the elevator at the end of the corridor and walks purposefully past the row of doors until he reaches Mindy 's . He reaches for the door . He notices that it 's ajar and pulls back his  --  94  --  hand at the last minute . He takes a deep breath , then kicks open the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of Mindy 's apartment slams open , Read is confronted by the bizarre spectacle of Rose hunched over Mindy 's prostrate form , sucking blood from the large vein in one of Mindy 's arms . The instant the door slams open , Rose pulls her blood-sucking organ out of Mindy 's arm and tries to hide it with her right hand . The organ , still dripping blood , slides back up under her arm into its sheath . The half-conscious Mindy puts her hand over the hole in her arm and mumbles incoherently . As Read approaches , Rose backs away , slipping her left arm back into her shirt and fumbling with the buttons . Rose now looks flushed and healthy , excited and alive . &nbsp; ROSE ( quietly ) It 's not my fault . It 's not my fault . &nbsp; READIt 's you . You 're the one . It 's been you all along . &nbsp; ROSEWhat are you talking about ? &nbsp; READYou carry the plague . You 've killed hundreds of people . &nbsp; ROSENo . . . no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about .

It 's all I can eat . And it 's your fault , not mine . It 's your fault ! Read takes three quick steps and grabs Rose by the shoulders . She shrinks away from him as though he were the monster . &nbsp; READThere must be some way to fix this . . . We 'll go to the police . . . we 'll go to the hospital . . . Rose twists out of Read 's grasp and runs for the front door . Read turns and runs after her , almost tripping over Mindy . Rose makes it out the door before Read can catch her . INT .

They struggle . &nbsp; READRose , listen to me . You 're right . We 're in it together . We 'll figure it all out together . . . As they struggle , Rose somehow smashes Read in the face with her elbow and he goes crashing backwards down the flight of stairs , hitting his head several times on the metal steps as he goes . She watches in horror as Read falls , then stands frozen for several heartbeats after he has landed in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs . She runs down after him and kneels beside him . He has a few large bruises on his forehead and temples but is still breathing . Rose touches his lips with her fingers briefly , then gets up and continues down the stairs .  --  96  --  EXT . ENTRANCE OF MINDY 'S APARTMENT  --  NIGHT Rose opens the front door of the apartment building and steps out on to the front steps , bewildered .

I was supposed to meet her here , but she must have gone out . &nbsp; MUSTACHIOED MANWell , it 's not safe to walk the streets these days , not for a while , anyway . Can I escort you somewhere ? Have you been vaccinated ? No ? Me neither . My brother told me he had to line up for three hours . Who 's got time ? &nbsp; ROSEListen . . . I need a place to stay tonight . At least until Mindy shows up . Could I stay with you ? For a little while ? &nbsp; MUSTACHIOED MAN ( slightly flustered ) I , ah . . . guess you could . I 'm a single guy , you know .

The single man sits slumped in an old wingback chair , his cheek bloody , his eyes closed . Rose has turned out all the lights in the apartment except for a small mood light near the telephone , which sits on an end table by a Victorian velvet sofa . She speaks quietly into the receiver , as though not wanting to wake the mustachioed man . &nbsp; ROSEIt 's me , Hart . I 'm glad I managed to get you . Are you all right ?

DISSOLVE TO : EXT .
