But the divided Supreme Court endorses affirmative action based on race <P> It had been heralded as the most important civil rights case since Brown vs . Board of Education , the 1954 ruling that outlawed racial segregation in the schools and ultimately in all of American life . The nation had moved far in 25 years , but the goal of equality had remained elusive , and the question now before the Supreme Court in the case of Regents of the University of California vs . Bakke seemed infinitely perplexing : Is it fair to give some preference to blacks over whites in order to remedy the evils of past discrimination ? <P> Split almost exactly down the middle , the Supreme Court last week offered a Solomonic compromise . It said that rigid quotas based solely on race were forbidden , but it also said that race might legitimately be an element in judging students for admission to universities . It thus approved the principle of " affirmative action , " the system by which the Government is pressuring U.S. universities , corporations and other institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , other minorities and women .

The wives had arrived . <P> At exactly 10 , Chief Justice Warren Burger stepped from behind the red velvet curtains and entered the courtroom . Eight other black-robed Supreme Court Justices followed as the marshal of the court sang out : " Oyez , oyez , oyez ! " and invoked the blessing of God on the " United States and this honorable court . " The Justices seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter Stewart to announce a routine decision on a pensions benefit case , then announced a minor decision himself . Finally it came , third on the list : Case No. 76-811 . Regents of the University of California vs . Bakke . As a hush enveloped the courtroom , Associate Justice Lewis Powell , a frail , bespectacled Virginian , began to speak in an emotionless monotone : " Perhaps no case in my memory has had so much media coverage . We speak today with a notable lack of unanimity . I will try to explain how we divided . "
