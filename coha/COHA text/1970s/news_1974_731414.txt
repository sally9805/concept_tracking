txt From the shouting millions of the enthusiastic Middle East , President Nixon returned to a gloomy capital considering his impeachment . On one hand America has been deluged with an extraordinary fantasia of television scenes showing the smiling President going from one romantic capital to another . Almost certainly that has given a lift to his low popularity ratings . On the other hand , congressional committees and courts have gone their inexorable way , and one more presidential aide , Herbert W. Kalmbach , Mr. Nixon 's personal lawyer , has been sentenced to jail and fined . // By R. Norman Matheny , staff photographer From triumphal trip , President Nixon returns to quiet but questioning capital *Grim mood apparent in Washington // Even in the few days of Mr. Nixon 's absence the ugly mood has deepened with a continuing series of leaks stemming apparently from members of the House Judiciary Committee on one hand , and a bitter response from members of the White House staff on the other . On the day of Mr. Nixon 's return presidential assistant Patrick J. Buchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ellsberg case found its way into print here , assailed " nameless and faceless character assassins " whom he associated with the Rodino committee staff , or membership . President Nixon will be off shortly to Moscow , and again his picture will saturate television as the personalized symbol of America dealing with foreign countries . It is taken for granted that this visit , too , will give Mr. Nixon 's domestic status a lift . Thinking here in Washington is , however , that this by itself is likely to be transitory and that the test lies in the material methodically accumulating in the House com mittee . Question raised The explosion of Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at Salzburg on the grounds that it is " not possible to conduct the foreign policy of the United States under these circumstances " indicates to soem that Wateragate follows Mr. Nixon everywhere . It also raises the question of how far the domestic business of government can be conducted " under these circumstances . " The postulates on impeachment widely-assumed in ordinary conversation of politicians and observers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Senate will fail to get the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction . Right or wrong , this implies , some say , that the normal business of Congress will suffer seriously . Many feel that there already has been a slowdown of activity on the executive side . If the Senate really gets an impeachment case , it will block out other work for six weeks to two months . This probably would end action on three major reform proposals pending in Congress and postpone them to the 94th Congress meeting next January when they all would have to start from scratch . The measures are tax reform , national health insurance , and a reform of campaign financing . Legislative gap seen Delay of these three would be the most spectacular among many others . It is doubtful if the public yet understands the gap such a trial c ou Id make in the legislative process . Many see a widespread slowdown in Washington today . This does not mean a lack of problems : the domestic and world economy , for example , are as menacing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Herbert Stein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , is ready to leave , but no replacement is named . Two others normally called on for economic advice , William E. Simon , Secretary of the Treasury , and Roy L. Ash , head of the Office of Management and Budget , are noneconomists . This is true also of Kenneth Rush , recently named " counselor for economic policy . " He has declined to testify before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on the basis of executive privilege . This has precipitated a new row with Congress . Atmosphere of doubt Many here doubt optimistic White House statements on inflation , the energy crisis , new-housing starts , and care of veterans ( where administrator Donald E. Johnson has resigned and not yet been replaced ) . Paul H. Nitze , top Pentagon member oft the U.S. nuclear-arms-limitation negotiating team , resigned in Mr. Nixon 's absence , charging that a successful SALT agreement is unlikely because of " traumatic events now unfolding " concerning Watergate . Morale is reported to be low in various departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sources : control from the White House is substantially lessened and various agencies are operating more independently .
