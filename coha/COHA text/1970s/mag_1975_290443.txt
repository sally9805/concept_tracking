Keys dangling from a belt over the left hip generally signal a desire to be sexually dominant ; on the right , a passive disposition . But the designations may change from city to city and bar to bar . An expert on left-right symbolism interviewed for the gay tabloid the Advocate last week warned of a further possible misunderstanding . If they are on the right side he said , it may just mean that the wearer is righthanded . <P> Another contributor reminisced about the good old days when " you could read a guy like a page , top to bottom . " Nowadays , wrote Karl Maves , two strangers in a bar may spend more than 20 minutes staring at each other just " to figure out what the hell the other one is supposed to mean . " The fellow in cowboy boots and beads , with the blue sequins spelling LOVE on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butch hippie , " a cruiser might speculate . " Or at least non-nellie . Without being anti-nellie of course . " <P> Like most subcultures , the homosexual world has its own language . To cruise is to go out looking for sex . A nellie is an effeminate fellow , and a butch a virile one . Male gays who project or seek hypermasculinity go to leather bars , often to pick up a partner for s. and m.

Trade refers to a very masculine hustler ( prostitute ) , and rough trade refers to straight men who seek homosexual sex ( called rough because of the risk of violence from the straight partner once the sex is over ) . <P> Many gay terms for sexual styles and tastes are putdowns .

Abigail is a nickname for a stuffy middle-aged gay . A front marriage is a legal marriage of convenience . Fag and faggot are acceptable terms among gays if no straights are present . <P> Gay speech can be fresh and funny but also dirty and self-deprecating .
