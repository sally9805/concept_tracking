It was a fine garden that Antonio Carrozzi kept . There were tall , aggressive beanstalks . Jungles of pregnant tomato vines . Ears of corn like golden footballs . And out front , placed there to conceal the tempting vegetables from passersby , 300 spindly marijuana plants . <P> " I did n't even know it could be smoked , " Carrozzi said when North Tarrytown , N.Y. , police harvested the offending shoots and planted a drug charge on the 57-year-old Italian immigrant . Indeed , Carrozzi , who speaks little English , did not even know it was marijuana . After a heart attack four years ago , Carrozzi testified at his trial last week , he visited his native village , Camarda in the Abruzzi Mountains and brought back a packet of canapa seeds . Camardans , he recalled from his youth , used canapa fibers to make thread and cloth . Its seeds are used in soups and candies . " The kids , " Carrozzi related , " used to carry them in their pockets and eat them like peanuts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village Justice John B. Whalen gave Carrozzi a conditional discharge , freeing him " on the condition that you no longer grow marijuana . " Replied Carrozzi : " No , no , never more in my life ! " Mused his wife Ada : " Always I wondered why in America , where they have everything , they did not have canapa seeds . I look everywhere for them-even in the birdseed . How come , I wonder , they do not have ? Now I know . "
