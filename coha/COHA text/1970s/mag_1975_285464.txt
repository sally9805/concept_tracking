Just when the President and Congress were eyeball to eyeball on economic and energy policy , both sides seemed to blink . Collision was giving way to compromise last week as the Democrats speedily hammered out a tax cut not too dissimilar to Gerald Ford 's proposal . Even though the White House and Capitol Hill were still at sharp odds over an energy package , everyone involved seemed to be looking out of the corner of his eye for an escape from the impasse . " I am more than willing to cooperate , " Ford told a group of Democratic congressional leaders . " I believe there are more grounds for agreement than disagreement . " Al Ullman , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and a key Democratic strategist , sounded the same conciliatory note . " We must find a way to avoid confrontation . If Congress and the Executive get into a hassle , this country will suffer . " <P> It was indeed no time for stalemate government ; the state of the economy demanded quick , concerted action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dip . Mainly because of soaring oil prices , the U.S. trade deficit reached $3.07 billion last year , the second largest deficit in American history after the 1972 imbalance of $6.9 billion . Most economists anticipated that the jobless rate would continue its climb . The only bright news was a decline in interest rates . While the health of the auto industry remained the largest question mark in predicting recovery , the stock market nonetheless had its biggest rally since May 1973 ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . <P> In whirlwind time , the House Democrats formed a rough consensus on a tax cut and began work on a bill . A procession of both liberal and conservative economists generally gave the Ways and Means Committee the same advice : cut taxes more than the $ 16 billion proposed by Ford and do it faster for maximum effect . Ford 's proposed two-part rebate scheme-one payment to be made in May , a second in September-would be too little , too late to hasten an economic upswing . Even Arthur Burns , the cautious , independent chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer an immediate reduction in taxes , provided it was not made permanent . Liberals also argued that more money than Ford had proposed should be returned to lower-income groups . <P> Ullman 's initial bill embodies most of this advice . He called for a tax cut of $18 billion , with $14 billion in relief for individuals and $4 billion for business . The measure included : <P> A 10% rebate on 1974 taxes that would return a maximum of $300 to an individual . The money returned would start to diminish at a taxable income level of $20,000 a year and would be eliminated for anyone with taxable income above $30,000 . The President had asked for a 12% rebate for all taxpayers , with a ceiling of $1,000 . <P> A rise in the standard deduction from $2,000 to a maximum deduction of $2,500 a year for individuals and $3,000 for joint returns . <P> A tax credit of 5% on all earned income up to $4,000 a year , as an additional boost for the poor . Above that figure , the credit would be phased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> A permanent increase in the investment tax credit from 7% to 10% . Ford had requested a hike to 12% , but only for a year .
