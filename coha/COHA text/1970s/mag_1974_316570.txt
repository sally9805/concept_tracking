Since the original Watergate break-in trial , only one defendant , Dwight Chapin , has been prosecuted all the way to a guilty verdict ( he was convicted of perjury ) . Meanwhile , one by one , Frederick LaRue , Jeb Magruder , Donald Segretti , John Dean , Egil Krogh , Herbert Porter , Herbert Kalmbach , Richard Kleindienst and Charles Colson have all made bargains with the special prosecutor 's office and pleaded guilty to reduced offenses . If nothing else , their pleas have raised doubts among both civil libertarians and law-and-order hardliners : Were the deals really necessary ? <P> By far the most controversial bargain was the one struck by former Attorney General Kleindienst . He faced a charge of having lied at his Senate confirmation hearing when he denied that he had been subjected to presidential pressure in the ITT case . But instead of being tried for perjury , he was allowed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor of having " refused to answer " certain questions . Many outside legal experts were astonished that Federal Judge George L. Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were even more surprised when the judge handed down a soft sentence : the statutory minimum of one month in jail and a $100 fine ( both suspended ) . <P> Higher-Ups . Embarrassed prosecutors blame Hart 's leniency for most of the uproar which has prompted more and more questions about all Watergate plea bargains . The practice itself is little admired but long established in the U.S. judicial system , where it is used mainly to reduce the number of trials on already crowded court dockets . But this consideration is scarcely relevant to Watergate ; federal prosecutors defend their use of bargained pleas on other grounds . For one thing , the bargains have meant sure , final convictions in many cases that might have been shaky in court . Also , the lesser Watergate cases must be settled quickly , prosecutors say , so that evidence developed with cooperative defendants can be used against the higher-ups . <P> So far , so good . But just how hard has Jaworski 's office been bargaining ? Both Krogh and Colson were apparently allowed to enter pleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deals he made as a federal prosecutor , Columbia Law Professor Abraham Sofaer says , " I always made sure what the evidence was . The individual involved has to become an ally of the Government in all respects . " <P> The bargaining has also posed a tactical problem for the Watergate prosecutors , as illustrated by the trial of John Mitchell and Maurice Stans in the SEC-Vesco case . While appearing for the prosecution , John Dean admitted that he hoped his testimony would help to hold down his own sentence ; the jury consequently discounted most of what he said . Jaworski 's office now seems to have decided that it is wiser to have sentences meted out before trying to use a bargained witness . So this week Colson will get his-as much as five years in prison plus up to a $5,000 fine .
