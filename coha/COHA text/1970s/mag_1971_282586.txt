Backward , turn backward , <P> O Time , in your flight , Make me a child again <P> just for tonight ! <P> - Elizabeth Akers Allen <P> That is not what No , No Nanette does , but nostalgia is the impetus of the evening . Nostalgia is rampant in the presence of Ruby Keeler , 60 , who emerges as a warmly appealing personality and dances with a valiant nimbleness . Nostalgia propels the tap-Rockette sequences of the Busby Berkeley chorus , with its mass assembly-line dance routines supervised by the 75-year-old <P> B.B. himself . Even though No , No Nanette dates from 1925 , the show more properly marks a reunion between Keeler and Berkeley , who in the early Depression era collaborated on such Warner Bros , extravaganzas as 42nd Street , Gold Diggers of 1933 , Footlight Parade and a spate of other Late Late Show favorites . Ruby has spent 30 retirement years in the wings , most of the time happily married to an industrial builder . But the roar of the greasepaint has drawn her irresistibly back to Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 in the chorus of a musical called The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly . <P> If the yearnings of nostalgia sometimes contain a touch of morbidity , that is certainly present in the sets and costumes , which celebrate the supreme bad taste of the ' 20s , especially in women 's dress . But nostalgia is not quite the appropriate word for the Vincent Youmans score , which has shown enduring vitality . Merely to mention the titles Tea for Two or / Want to Be Happy is to summon up the transporting glow that occasionally makes this show enchantment . <P> The book is one of those narrative toothpick trees that the ' 20s musicals utilized only to festoon with girls and dances . The central figure is a near-millionaire Bible publisher , whom Jack Gilford plays with gullible charm . Gilford is a kind of platonic sucker who has been gilding the palms of three avaricious flappers without any amorous return on his investment . He does n't want his wife ( Keeler ) to find out about it , and he orders his lawyer ( Bobby Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess . It all adds up to a kind of microminiature Feydeau farce set in Atlantic City . <P> Question of Camp . The top professional honors of the evening go to Bobby Van , who dances like an Anglo-Saxon Zorba , and Helen Gallagher , the girl who plays his wife . As she acts and sings ( " Where-Has-My-Hubby-Gone " Blues ) , a smolderingly authentic Fitzgerald heroine comes alive on the stage . A special medal should be struck for Patsy Kelly as a comic howitzer of a maid with hilarious delayed-fuse timing . <P> The show is a copious delight , but it has a sizable temperamental flaw . No strict decision was made as to whether it should be played straight or campy , and the latter apparently won out as the lesser commercial risk . Camp is low-level satire , and it tends to destroy both the past and the present with a snicker . Far from being a " great creative sensibility , " as acclaimed by Susan Sontag , camp is anti-sensibility . Its intrinsic nature is sterile , and it applies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values are equally sterile . Thus at one moment No , No Nanette fashions an affectionate valentine to the past , and in the very next moment perforates it with a derisory dart from the present .
