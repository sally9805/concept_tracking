The one major area of foreign affairs to which the Carter Administration has devoted relatively little effort is China . To remedy that , National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski set out for Peking last week at the head of a team of military , diplomatic and economic experts ( but no reporters ) . Shortly before his departure , at a lunch with the editors of TIME , he was asked for his assessment of the degree to which the Carter Administration was succeeding-or failing-in its foreign policy . His answer : <P> A big country like the U.S. is not like a speedboat on a lake . It ca n't veer suddenly to the right or left . It 's like a large ship . There 's continuity to its course . There 's continuity between our Administration 's foreign policy and the policy of our predecessors and , indeed , between them and their predecessors . <P> However , each Administration imposes its own stamp on foreign policy , by turning a little bit from one side to the other . I think there are certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter , by nature , is what I would call a structural reformer . He does n't like to deal with the superficialities of problems . He really likes to deal with the essence of the problem with thorough , far-reaching reform . You see this in his domestic programs and in the things he 's trying to do in foreign policy . That generates much more resistance . Indeed , it may sometimes create coalitions of opponents and thereby create problems for us . <P> Nonetheless , to the extent that over a period of time he is successful , I think his successes are likely to be more important and more far-reaching . I think our record on the whole is good , with some failings . <P> We have done well in establishing human rights as an issue on the agenda . Today there is n't a government which does n't realize that human rights affects their relationship with us . By and large , on every continent there has been some progress-and more in the past year , thanks to this policy , than in preceding years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating the U.S. to new forces in the world , to the new countries that have become more important recently , particularly in the Third World . We sense this at the United Nations . We sense it in relations with such countries as India , Nigeria , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Brazil , Venezuela-newly influential countries which the President has visited . <P> I would agree that we have not done well enough in developing a North-South economic program . But we have improved the nature of the political relationship with the Third World and the way the Third World perceives us . <P> I think it 's very important that the U.S. not be identified with the status quo , which , in general , is the way it used to be identified . President Carter has identified the U.S. with change in world affairs , thereby giving us the opportunity to shape the nature of change and provide the framework for it . That 's a fundamentally important consideration , in terms of the U.S. relationship with the world as a whole . The U.S. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
