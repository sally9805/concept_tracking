It was warm , clear , sunny and windless in Candlestick Park , and the large crowd was bursting with enthusiasm as the Giants defeated the Dodgers 4-2 on Opening Day of the 1976 baseball season in San Francisco . Now there , humdrum though it may appear on casual examination , is a piece of information that is extraordinary in every particular . Warm , clear , sunny , windless in Candlestick Park ? Large crowd ? Bursting with enthusiasm ? Giants defeat Dodgers ? Opening Day in San Francisco ? Why , only a few months ago there seemed to be about as much chance of there being a baseball opener in San Francisco as there was of Ronald Reagan embracing Maoism . That it should open so auspiciously , considering the obstacles flung in its path , is nothing short of miraculous . And if we are to believe that the course of true love never does run smooth , then the Giants and the fans they have so successfully estranged in recent years should now enjoy a romance that will make the Brownings ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that this may be the real thing . When it was finally and officially announced last month that the Giants would remain in San Francisco after many months of speculation that they would move to foreign soil , 4,000 people crammed into a ballroom at the Jack Tar Hotel to celebrate . Giant players , unaccustomed to seeing so many people in one place , stared in bewilderment at the teeming mass . " This is very un-San Franciscan , " said Shortstop Chris Speier . On the eve of last week 's opener there was a parade through the downtown streets and a brown bag luncheon rally in Union Square , normally a refuge for pigeons , mystics and the dispossessed . All of them were dislodged this day by about 5,000 Giant rooters . " I like it , I like it , I like it , " said the ebullient pitcher , John ( The Count ) Montefusco , as he addressed the multitudes . " You people are in my heart . " // The next afternoon The Count provided the Giants ' only Opening Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Franciscans have come to take Montefusco 's boasts seriously , for last season he predicted he would be the Rookie of the Year and , indeed , he was . His shutout lasted only two batters before Dodger Centerfielder Dusty Baker hit a home run . From then on , Montefusco handled Los Angeles with ease and benefited from a rare outburst of slugging from his teammates . Rightfielder Bobby Murcer tied the game with a homer in the bottom of the first , and was aboard on a single three innings later when Leftfielder Gary Matthews hit one over the fence in front of the left-field seats to put the Giants ahead to stay . Matthews ' swat was greeted by a tumultuous roar from the crowd of 37,261 , the Giants ' biggest Opening Day assemblage in a decade . // The crowd might well have exceeded 50,000 had not a strike of city employees placed pickets at the gates of municipally owned Candlestick . There was no regular bus service to the stadium , and because many of the union vendors would not cross the picket lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in a spirit that is truly San Franciscan , the fans brought their own refreshments and helped clean up the mess afterward . Even more impressive than its size and resourcefulness was the crowd 's passionate regard for the home team . " There was a buzzing out there , " said Matthews . " It was the same kind you feel in places like Cincinnati . " // The buzz had been faint in recent years . In 1975 the Giants drew only 522,919 customers and had the lowest attendance in the major leagues . The year before they attracted 519,987 to windy Candlestick . The team reportedly lost $3.5 million in those two seasons and nearly $6.5 million in the last eight years . The stars of the 60s  --  Willie Mays , Willie McCovey , Juan Marichal  --  had all been peddled away , and the front office , headed by patriarchal Horace Stoneham , had grown old , tired and indifferent . // The Giants obviously were ready to be sold . At first it seemed the team might go to Japanese interests who would keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was announced that an agreement had been reached with Labatt 's Breweries of Toronto , which would buy the Giants and move them to Canada . Enter the first of a succession of real and would-be saviors , the newly elected mayor of San Francisco , George Moscone , a former high school basketball star and an avid sports fan . Promising a " battle royal " to keep the team in town , Moscone obtained a Superior Court restraining order that temporarily delayed the sale . He also threatened the National League with a $10 million lawsuit if it approved the move to Toronto . // Moscone knew he would not have to look far for one potential local purchaser . Bob Lurie , a millionaire real-estate man and a member of the Giants ' board of directors for 15 years , previously had tried to organize a group to buy the team . He was personally prepared to put up half the $8 million asking price . Moscone brought Lurie together with Bob Short , the flamboyant Minneapolis hotelman and former owner of the Washington Senators-Texas Rangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two Bobs agreed to split the ownership equally , and on Feb. 23 , Lurie and Moscone flew to the National League meeting in Chicago to close the deal . There a tentative agreement was reached , contingent upon the new owners fulfilling some conditions . The most significant of these was that Lurie should either be the team 's majority owner or its official spokesman . Short , who had caused baseball embarrassment by moving the Senators from the nation 's capital to Arlington , Texas , was regarded warily by the National League owners . He was not in Chicago to defend himself , having slipped on a patch of ice outside a Minneapolis church and broken his elbow and pelvis . It was Lurie 's lot to bring his wounded partner news of the league 's decision . Short was outraged , and on March 2 , only hours before the final deadline set for sale of the team , he withdrew from the partnership . // Enter the final savior , Arthur ( Bud ) Herseth , head of the largest independent meat-packing company in Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press secretary to advise him that if either of the Bobs should drop out , he would like to join in the Giants ' deal . At 2:45 p.m. , two hours and 15 minutes before the deadline , Lurie and Herseth talked for the first time . By five Lurie was in the office of National League President Chub Feeney with a new offer in which both owners would share equally . It was approved immediately . // Lurie and Herseth are an unlikely duo . Lurie , 47 , is urbane and soft-spoken . His father was the late Louis Lurie , a multimillionaire patron of the arts , boulevardier and friend of the great ( he celebrated his birthdays with Maurice Chevalier ) . Bob necessarily moved unobtrusively in the old man 's shadow . Ironically , he now is probably more famous than his father ever was . He is the hero owner , cheered for so much as adjusting his necktie in public . // Herseth is a man of the range who is unfettered by social custom . " I 've been standing in cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my language , " he says . He speaks rapidly , loudly and most of the time , and he likes his associates to have the common touch . " I told my lawyer that if this Mr. Lurie was some kind of big shot the deal was off , " he says . " But he 's just a nice common little fella . His suits even hang on him . " Herseth shares Lurie 's unbridled exuberance for their new property , a feeling they have successfully conveyed to the community . // Recently Lurie has achieved a measure of ubiquity , appearing on radio and television and at countless public gatherings . He seems unfazed by trouble . While giving the press a sample of the improved food to be sold at Candlestick  --  some hot dogs , for example , will be served on sesame-seed rolls  --  Lurie invited the pickets pacing outside the gate to share the repast . When it was rumored that the Dodgers might honor the picket line and decline to play the opener , he shrugged and said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // New Manager Bill Rigney also directed the Giants after they moved to San Francisco from New York in 1958 . He has been welcomed back by the fans as an old friend , and he , too , has given the team fresh color . When the rain that had pelted down earlier in the week providentially ceased for the opener , Rigney stood in the sun behind the batting cage , nodded his thanks to the Creator , then pointed at the center-field stands , which were slowly being populated . // " When was the last time you saw anybody sitting out there ? " he asked . " Never is the answer . I tell you , it 's a new show here . " Then he gestured toward his players on the field and said , " But the act better be good , too , or we 'll lose the audience . " // So far , so good .
