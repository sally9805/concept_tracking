Having once dressed up its image with an anthropomorphic ad campaign ( " I 'm Cheryl , Fly me " ) , National Airlines now has suitors buzzing all around . Object : merger or acquisition . Little Texas International has bought 23% of National 's stock . Mighty Pan Am has acquired 24% and wants much more . Last week Eastern Air Lines Chairman Frank Borman , the ex-astronaut , said his line would bid $50 a share for the stock , or $9 more than Pan Am 's offer . So intense has been the wooing that National Chairman Lewis ( " Bud " ) Maytag , 52 , collapsed from exhaustion and briefly entered a Colorado hospital to convalesce . <P> Everybody wants National because of its fleet . Eastern had to pay $778 million for 19 modern European Airbus jumbos ; buying all of National 's shares would give Eastern 55 modern jets for $427 million . U.S. airlines are suffering from a severe equipment shortage , forcing them to jam more and more seats into available cabins . Deregulation is aggravating the shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fare cuts are luring ever more passengers into the air . <P> Though Borman swears he is serious about the bid , airmen gossip that Eastern is merely trying to delay the merger between National , its competitor , and Pan Am . Civil Aeronautics Board staffers are said to favor a Pan Am-National combination because it would join two non-duplicating route systems . An Eastern merger makes far less sense because the purpose of deregulation , to stimulate competition in the industry , would be frustrated if National were removed as a competitor on 19% of Eastern 's routes . <P> It is by no means certain that Pan Am will win , though Maytag was urging National 's stockholders to vote in favor of a Pan Am merger . Another possible bidder is circling overhead . Northwest Orient Chairman Donald Nyrop dined last month at " 21 " Club , the Manhattan saloon , and discussed a merger with none other than National 's Bud Maytag.
