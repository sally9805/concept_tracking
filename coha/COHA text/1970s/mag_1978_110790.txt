There is a chill in the air early on a summer morning at the race track in Ruidoso Downs , N. Mex . Marlboro Men , here by the posse , are big-chested in goose-down vests as they trot by on their palominos and bays . Soon , though , the sun will be up over the pine-shaggy mountains of the Sacramento range where , astride their Yamaha 500s , the Apache still ride . High time to work the horses out before the temperature blazes into the 90s . On Aug. 27 , this small , pretty track will see the running of one of the richest horse races in the world , the All American Derby for quarter horses , purse $750,000 . No time to fool around . // One of the biggest of the Marlboro Men , white-Stetsoned , aboard a white pony , rides up to Barn 34 at Ruidoso Downs . He is Blane Schvaneveldt , horse trainer , late of Idaho , now of Stanton , Calif . Waiting for him is a smaller man , weathered , hair ginger-going-gray : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the word " farmer " is adequate for a man who ships out 800,000 sacks of potatoes every year and grows about 2,000 acres of barley . He is also the owner of the small bay gelding now nuzzling affectionately into his shoulder . The gelding is Town Policy . // Town Policy 's track record is impressive : from June 7 until Oct. 14 , 1977 , 10 starts , nine wins , earnings of $336,730 . Since May 26 of this year , two wins , including a record time of 21.57 in the Los Alamitos Derby , and one second-place finish . His record is also intriguing . With a horse clearly as talented as Town Policy , why the extraordinary blank in mid-career ? The answer to that question may never be known in full . // On the night of Oct. 19 , 1977 , just five days after he won the Fresno Futurity , Town Policy was in his stall at Schvaneveldt 's ranch in Stanton , south of the Santa Ana Freeway and east of Long Beach , in a setting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens , with the former clearly winning the battle for space . At some point between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m . Town Policy disappeared . // The horse , it seemed from his tracks , was led out of his stall to a waiting vehicle , possibly a moving van . Then , it seems , he was driven south across the border . // Schvaneveldt heard the news while he was at the airport , about to leave for a horse sale in Oklahoma . He reached Ashment . " I 've got bad news , " he said , though a chance still existed that Town Policy had merely strayed . // At first , there did n't seem to be any clear motive for the horsenapping . The horse was a gelding , so there was no question of taking him to a mare . Moreover , his lip tattoo would prevent him from being raced . // For two weeks after Town Policy disappeared , no real lead emerged , though wild rumors reached the ears of Schvaneveldt and Ashment . " We heard he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , on his way to Australia , " Ashment now recalls with amusement . " Somebody claimed he 'd been seen floating in the sea off Long Beach with a notice on him reading , ' I 'll teach you to beat me in a race . ' " And then , on Nov. 2 , a man named Bob Howard made the first of what would prove to be many phone calls . // Howard had once owned Tiny Watch , a champion quarter horse . Now , though , his connection with the track was confined mainly to odd jobs , like shoeing , and betting . Howard was hardly ever out of the complex dealings that marked the search for Town Policy . He telephoned Ashment constantly with news of fresh leads that would result in the horse 's recovery . Once he indicated that Ashment should contact a Mexican called Parada living in El Paso . After Ashment had called him , Parada ( who has since run into legal problems connected with the possession of heroin ) threatened to " take care of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of jail , come after me yet .... " // Although the motivation for the horsenapping remained in doubt , a connection with drug trafficking seemed plausible , and by now the FBI and other police agencies felt that the horse , if still alive , was in Mexico . In Mexico there is a tradition of private match races between horses owned by wealthy ranchers , with as much as $100,000 being staked on the outcome . Indeed , Town Policy 's jockey , Ken Hart , had ridden match races in Mexico , being flown in on chartered aircraft for a win or lose fee of $3,000 for a single race . ( Ashment , incidentally , indignantly refutes a Bob Howard " allegation " that pointed at Hart . " He 's a grand person , " Ashment says . " I 'd trust him with my life . " ) // Howard 's credibility with Ashment reached its peak before last Christmas when he persuaded the owner to lend him a horse  --  New World , a half-brother of Town Policy for whom Ashment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of live bait , the theory being that he could trade it for Town Policy and so obtain his return . The ploy was fruitless , and Ashment had considerable difficulty getting New World back . When the horse was eventually brought home by Shirley Schvaneveldt , the trainer 's wife , he was in bad shape . Friends told Ashment that he was foolish to continue going along with Howard 's rainbow-chasing. // The breakthrough , when it came , was from an entirely different source . Ashment is loud in praise for the offers of help he received from many quarters , but the most useful came from an official of the U.S. Department of Agriculture . He suggested that Tom McCall , for 21 years a livestock inspector for the department , specializing in the cross-border cattle trade , might be given a leave of absence to apply his expertise to the search for Town Policy . // In his long service with the department , McCall had built up an extensive network of agents in Mexico , and some of the $25,000 reward money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In less than two months the wheels were turning smoothly . In late February , McCall telephoned Ashment . Both he and Schvaneveldt were to fly down to the city of Chihuahua , where they would meet with McCall on March 7 . Town Policy was said to be hidden just outside of Chihuahua , but the trip was unrewarding . From Chihuahua , Ashment , Schvaneveldt and McCall were directed to Durango , where they met with the chief of police , Jaime Garcia de Toro . They drove to a ranch about 14 miles outside the " city that belonged to a man called Leonardo Guerrero , who has since disappeared . No Town Policy , but there were signs that a horse had recently been moved . A ranch hand was arrested . Trainer and owner returned home to await developments , but before that Ashment had asked what would be done to the arrested man to get the story from him . " Maybe we tell him he will be in jail the rest of his life , " the police said . // Whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 14 , Ashment and his trainer were summoned south again , this time to another Durango ranch . And there , Garcia de Toro showed Ashment his horse . Ashment wept . It was almost five months since he had seen Town Policy . // The horse looked awful . He had lost possibly 150 pounds . But Schvaneveldt concluded that he had suffered no lasting harm . Town Policy was shipped back to California , where Schvaneveldt began to fatten him up and train him . Almost miraculously , a little more than two months later , Town Policy was winning races again  --  first the trial for the Los Alamitos Derby , then the Derby itself , picking up $57,750 . And in June he was shipped to Ruidoso. // Ashment postulates a complex theory on the horsenapping : Town Policy was traded , for possibly a million dollars worth of heroin , to run in private matches , after which he was to be ransomed back to his owner . Indeed , Howard has claimed that Town Policy was run at least twice in Mexico . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the trial for the $450,000 Rainbow Derby , Town Policy ran second and did not compete in the big race on July 3 . Neither Schvaneveldt nor Mike Chambless , the assistant trainer who first discovered Town Policy was missing last October , was entirely put out , though . The latter said , " When we ran him he got real tired . Last year , the altitude never affected him Ruidoso is about 7,000 feet above sea level but , shoot , this is a year later , he 's been through a lot . " // Both men hope to see him do far better in the All American Derby . With all that prize money , winning it will be the best way Town Policy has of giving a long , derisive horse laugh to his kidnappers . Whoever they might be .
