They descended out of the boxes at Arlington Park racetrack , an excited and talkative little throng of folks , all flushed . They pressed through the fans at the rail in noisy yet rather efficient fashion  --  not unlike schoolchildren in a fire drill  --  to crowd inside the winner 's circle . They were visibly proud and pretty puffed up , yet a little stiff and bashful , too , unaccustomed as some of them were to glory . But they kept arriving in the winner 's circle until it was more or less overflowing with them  --  perhaps two dozen in all , cousins and in-laws and children and grandchildren and old school chums and a family doctor and certain other shirttail relations . This was the family of Mann  --  John L. Mann of Dallas  --  here assembled to pose radiantly for pictures , to receive congratulations and certain other more material rewards for the remarkable performance of their one-horse racing stable . " We may have only one , " said John Mann , " but is n't he just the one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's pride  --  a strong and handsome 2-year-old bay named Staunch Avenger , who was bought at a budget price  --  went to the starting gate for the fourth time in his life and came home a winner for the fourth time . // The occasion was the 15th running of the $53,400 Arch Ward stakes at gaudy old Arlington outside Chicago , where Staunch Avenger has been the talk of the track this season . In his first start there eight weeks ago the colt won by a widening 12 lengths , breaking the track record . After his second start , which he won by four lengths , the Mann family 's trainer , a laconic little Texan with the nicely distilled name of Gin Collins , decided the colt was ready for the $135,000 Sapling Stakes at Monmouth Park in New Jersey . Staunch Avenger won that by four lengths , pulling away from a classy field of 13 , which included six young stakes winners . The Manns quite obviously owned one of the best 2-year-olds in the country . // Thus in the Arch Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 to 10 . The field was considered quite hopelessly mediocre compared to the lot Staunch Avenger had conquered in the Sapling . Nevertheless , it required a fine ride by Jockey Dave Whited and an impressive display of homestretch heart for Staunch Avenger to win  --  by a photo-finish neck  --  over Hook It Up , a good horse who had already won two stakes himself this year . With the win Staunch Avenger added $30,900 to his earlier earnings , giving him a rather staggering accumulation of $117,647 in winnings over those scant four starts . // The colt 's sudden success has startled the Manns . " We thought this kind of thing might happen to other people , " says Annette Mann , 47 , mother of four , grandmother of five and the owner of record of Staunch Avenger . " But my wildest dreams never contained such a horse as ol ' Staunch has come to be . " Indeed , as John Mann , son of a Texas cotton farmer and now head of an aircraft-parts company in Dallas , puts it : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us get themselves a good horse , because mostly this sport 's controlled by big money . We liked cheap horses , and we never thought to rise above that mark . " // The Manns approached the sport of kings with quite genuine common desires . Eight years ago they journeyed from Dallas to Hot Springs , Ark. to watch their first horse race . " We found it highly entertaining , " says Mr. Mann . " But we also felt it would be even more fun to see if we had a horse of our own to cheer , so a year later we went down to Frisco , Texas , where some friends had horses and we bought our first , Trinity River , for $2,500 . " Since then the Manns have dabbled in horse racing in an almost wholly recreational way . Until now they have never owned a horse that could return much better than $1,000 purses , and sometimes they found themselves so awash in family affection for their animals that more than once John Mann quietly put up money to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want one of her beloved " pets " sold to strangers . // The joy of thoroughbred ownership was at least emotionally ( if not financially ) fulfilling , and the Manns continued to buy and sell a few horses here and there . In the fall of 1969 they gave Gin Collins a " blank check " ( not really  --  for they did not wish to exceed $15,000 ) to go to the Keeneland , Ky. sales to buy a yearling . Now Gin Collins ' reputation as a trainer perhaps does not rank with men like Allen Jerkens or Elliott Burch , but he has had a number of good horses in his keep , including Battleground and Swift Ruler . In quest of one for the Manns he hoped to buy something with Bold Ruler bloodlines , and thus when a colt came up for sale whose sire was Staunchness , a son of Bold Ruler , Gin Collins put in his bid . Now , as fate would have it , this horse was fresh from pasture , and he was a bit raggedy looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to auction . " Since he was n't fattened up , " said Collins , " he did n't seem to appeal to other buyers so much . " He cost only $7,700. // The Manns are not superstitious people . ( The only ritual any of them follows for luck before each of Staunch Avenger 's races is that son John , 25 , always wears a pair of gold undershorts . ) Yet they do find themselves hard put to ignore at least the hint of predestined fortune in their relationship with Staunch Avenger . " You see , he 's got this pinkish marking on his nose , " says John Mann , and there is a small tremor of wonder in his voice . " And if you look at it upside down it 's shaped an awful lot like the state of Texas . Well , we 're from Texas , and so is Gin and so is Dave Whited , our jockey . I do n't know if that means we have a lot going for us or not , but I 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // Perhaps the colt is marked for greatness . Time will tell . " He 's the fastest I 've ever ridden , " said Whited , " and I 've been on some fast horses . Yet he 's not speed crazy  --  he does n't mind laying off the pace . And you never saw a horse so easygoing  --  he 's like a big old cow when he 's not running . He drags his feet around and lolls along . He wears out his shoes three times as fast as your average horse . He 's got the personality to be one of the best , because he 's not washy and he 's not wild . " // Gin Collins , a patient and profoundly cautious man , has been extremely conservative in bringing Staunch Avenger along . Instead of entering him in early Arkansas races last spring , he waited until summer for the debut . // Collins is noncommittal about Staunch Avenger 's future  --  both near and far-off . There is talk about bringing him to the East again for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , there is some talk , early though it is , about Staunch Avenger as a 3-year-old competing in the Triple Crown races . " You just can not own a horse like this without thinking about the Kentucky Derby , " says Mrs. Mann . " I mean , that is what it 's all meant to be for , is n't it ? " // If Staunch Avenger continues to maintain a pace even close to his sensational beginning , it would be impossible to imagine the 1971 Derby without his presence . Yet Gin Collins says , " I do n't happen to believe the Kentucky Derby is necessarily the most important race in the world . It might be too long a race too early in the year . It might take too much out of the horse to get ready for it . I just do n't know for sure that we 'd have to enter the Derby . " // Nevertheless , after seeing that large and handsome tribe of Manns gathered in triumph around Staunch last week , it would seem far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to pose for still another mass family portrait , among the roses at Churchill Downs .
