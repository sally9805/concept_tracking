 | Bill Cosby Laughter With Lessons THE DAY BILL COSBY told his mother that he wanted to quit college and become a ? median , she took sick from the shock and stayed in bed for seven weeks . In the 14 years since then , Cosby has recorded 19 comedy albums which have sold rr million records and won five Grammy Awards . As an acto- , he has starred in movies , and three television series which have netted him four Emmy Awards . Last year , he made over loo appearances throughout the country , earning as much as $50,000 a night , and this fall he 'll host a new familyhour variety show . Bill Cosby 's original and imaginative humor is often compared to Mark Twain 's . While Twain told  | childhood stories of river life on the Mississippi , Cosby paints the side of America he experienced growing up in a North Philadelphia ghetto . A classic Cosby routine describes a game of street football : " We had the greatest quarterback in the world , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called a play like this : Okay , listen to this now . Arty , you go down ten steps and cut left behind the black Chevy . Cosby , you go down to Third Street , catch the J bus , have him open the doors at 19th Street , and I 'll fake her to ya . Until he was 12 , William Henry Cosby , Jr. , lived in an all-black housing project . Some people in the neighborhood worked hard . Others , winos and unemployed fathers , hung out on the street corners . Youth gangs , some harmless , others more menacing , roamed the streets . Cosby and his friends often played in a junkyard . Cosby 's father , a ship 's steward , was rarely home . His mother worked as a domestic , and at times she and her three sons were on welfare . Young Bill contributed to the family income by delivering groceries and working as a shoeshine boy . Cosby 's brush strokes were often matched by jokes which left his customers in stitches . Even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once wrote to his mother : " Bill is an alert boy who would rather clown than study . " Cosby 's favorite people were comedians , especially television 's Sid Caesar . " I used to dream of being Caesar 's second banana , " he recalls . Bill and his friends would spend hours watching television , making jokes about what they saw , especially the commercials . But as soon as a comedian came on the screen , Cosby became serious , studying how funny material was delivered . Besides imitating other comedians , Cosby learned to joke about everything ? even things like poverty , or alcoholics . A favorite story concerns the time he and his friends were walking home late at night after seeing a monster movie and were scared out of their wits by an old wino coming out of an alley . " Bill could turn painful situations around and make them funny , " his brother Robert says . " You laughed to keep from crying . " While Cosby grew up in a neighborhood which offered many opportunities for getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Salvation Army offered the youngster alternatives , especially sports activities . And his fifth- and sixth-grade teacher , Mary Forchic Nagle , instilled in him feelings of pride and self-confidence . Perhaps the greatest influence was his mother , Anna Cosby . Young Bill knew that if he did anything seriously wrong it would embarrass her . When asked what she feels she has contributed toward her son 's success , however , she modestly replies , " The only thing I had to give him was plenty of love , and oh , dear God , I gave him all I had . But success comes  | from within , and Bill was determined to be something . " That determination did not include being a dedicated scholar . Cosby was placed in classes for gifted students at Germantown High , but he was more interested in goofing off . After repeating the tenth grade , he dropped out and joined the Navy . Always a good athlete , he became a basketball and track star . He also finished high school through a Navy-sponsored extension course . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he made the dean 's list , ran track and played varsity football . Eventually , some of his best comedy routines would portray him as a player afraid of being hurt in scrimmage . In his sophomore year , Cosby started bartending in a Philadelphia cafe to help meet his college expenses . He served jokes with the drinks , and his customers encouraged him to set his sights on a showbusiness career . His first nightclub appearance was in a room so small that Cosby , six feet tall , had to sit while performing ? making him perhaps the world 's first sit-down comedian . One night the owner of the Gaslight Cafe , a club in New York 's Greenwich Village , caught his act and hired him for $6o to appear there on weekends . Cosby remained briefly at Temple in his junior year , then quit , at age 25 , to concentrate on being a nightclub comic . Although his parents disapproved of Cosby 's new career , his grandfather Samuel , now 95 , recognized Bill 's flair for telling stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell , his grandfather said , " Why do n't you tell the story about when you and your brothers ... " Cosby has been doing that ever since , tapping a tremendous reservoir of boyhood experiences and magnifying them for comic effect . He became a hit on the nightclub circuit and television variety shows , and in 1965 was selected by TV producer Sheldon Leonard to co-star with Robert Culp on " I Spy , " a series in which he and Culp played a pair of hip U.S. undercover agents masquerading as traveling tennis players . From 1969 to 1971 , he played a physical-education teacher on " The Bill Cosby Show . " But it was always humor and his childhood experiences that Cosby kept coming back to , and in 1972 , in association with Filmation Studios , he created the TV show , " Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids . " Fat Albert , Weird Harold , Dumb Donald and Rudy the Rich are animated-cartoon re-creations of childhood buddies , and the fact that they live ' in a black ghetto has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh at the gang 's antics . Unlike most children 's shows , however , lessons are served up with the laughs . As Cosby warns on camera in each episode : " Here 's Bill Cosby coming at you with music and fun , and if you 're not careful , you may learn something . " The emphasis is on education  | aimed at influencing feelings , behavior and value judgments . Produced with an advisory committee of educators , psychologists and sociologists , the show has proved so effective that it won The Children 's Theater Association Seal of Excellence ( 1973 ) and the Ohio State University Award for meritorious achievement in education broadcasting ( 1975 ) . McGraw-Hill Films recently made shortened versions available to schools . Since the show went on the air , Cosby has attracted an army of little fans , who send him 1500 letters a month . Children trust him . He understands their world . " I can be silly , I can be grown-up , I can be an older brother , I can be just a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity . In 1971 , Cosby surprised many of his friends by going back to college to work toward a Ph.D. , which he expects to receive by the end of this year . Extensive tests showed that Cosby , even though he lacked a bachelor 's degree , was self-educated enough to enter graduate school at the University of Massachusetts with a program of flexible class attendance . His field is the media as a tool for teaching . As part of his studies , Cosby has developed a group of films , along with booklets , to be used in teaching children from lowerand middle-class economic areas . The Cosbys now live in a small town outside Amherst , Mass. , where they have restored a 15-room , 140-year-old clapboard farmhouse and furnished it with colonial antiques collected by Bill 's wife , Camille . They were married in 1964 , much to the distress of her parents , who thought he would never amount to much . The Cosbys have four children , ages 3 to 11 , and are expecting their fifth this August . Unlike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not like hero worship , except perhaps from his little fans . At 39 , he is a secure man who says , " I 'm not struggling anymore . All the things I 've ever wanted , I have . " As often as possible Cosby returns to his old neighborhood in Philadelphia . " Part of me will always be there , " he explains . " Man , that 's my home . " Not long ago , during one of these visits , he saw a group of kids playing stickball . To the children 's delight , he stopped to play with them . The back street was so small that for a home run you had to hit the ball straight up in the air . That 's exactly what Cosby did ? and by the look on his face , he was a child once again , playing with Fat Albert and the gang . 112
