In The Meaning of My Life , her effusive 1951 autobiography , Eva Pern declared : " He Pern taught me my first steps and everything from then on . " <P> Maria ( " Isabelita " ) Martinez de Pern , 42 , has obviously learned more steps than did her predecessor . Evita 's hopes of becoming Vice President in 1951 were dashed by a determinedly male-chauvinist military . This time round , with an overwhelming election victory for both Perns , no such opposition is anticipated . Barring the total collapse of order in Argentina , Isabelita will become her country 's first female Vice President on inauguration day , Oct. 12 . <P> Electing a woman Vice President in male-dominated Argentina was no easy task . Indeed , when the Justicialist convention nominated Pern and his third wife last August , many Argentines reacted with incredulity and anger . Isabelita broke down in tears when she accepted her party 's vice-presidential nomination , but the weeping was a deceptive sign of weakness . In fact , she seems to be every bit as tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-preserved blonde , Isabelita was born to a middle-class family in the impoverished Argentine province of La Rioja . After leaving home in her early 20s , she joined a troupe of touring folk dancers . She met the exiled Pern in Panama City in 1956 while she was performing in a nightclub and married him five years later in Madrid . <P> Isabelita soon became Pern 's most effective voice in exile , carrying his commands to Justicialists throughout Argentina . In 1971 , when it seemed that warring factions would destroy the movement , Pern , in the words of chess-conscious Argentines , " moved his queen . " Isabelita was dispatched to Buenos Aires , where she reminded her countrymen that " Pern is the only Peronist presidential candidate . " <P> Her toughest challenge came last August : she had to mollify the many elements within the Justicialist movement who had only reluctantly acquiesced in her nomination . At first they had rea son to regret their choice . In her initial campaign appearances , she often looked as if she had been laminated in plastic immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ( it had once been chestnut brown ) , many Argentines complained that she intentionally made herself up to look like Evita . Others simply found her cold . " If Eva Peron was passion compressed , " grumbled one Peronist , " Isabel is an icebox . " <P> Isabelita made up for her lack of warmth with poise and words carefully calculated to soothe rather than rouse . <P> She visited children 's hospitals , kissing crippled babies in front of the TV cameras . She flew over the flood-ravaged pampas in order to dramatize the need for relief . During the campaign she made an eight-stop tour of the north . She even managed to enlist the support of her most vocal enemies , the party 's left-wing youth . They organized a huge crowd for her at Buenos Aires ' Aeroparque airport , which significantly cheered both Peron and Isabelita . In all , it was precisely the kind of stumping Evita made famous among the descamisados ( shirtless ones ) , who loved her as much for her queenly air as for the hard cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
