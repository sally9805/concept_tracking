txt Kerner lives in past as he waits for vindication OTTO KERNER stood in his shirtsleeves in the small office near the lake , among the mismatched furniture and the unpacked carton boxes and the constant clacking of a secretary 's typewriter . He took a long drag on his cigaret and spit a tiny crumb of tobacco from his Ups and . . . " Uh , let 's see . . . we can really sit anywhere , I suppose , not that there 's too much choice , it 's kind of small  --  the office . But you know , when it 's hot , you do get a nice breeze from off the lake . " Here , why do n't you take off your jacket and ... uh .. . sit anywhere . I 'll just take this straight-backed chair  --  I prefer them . My back , you know . An old service injury . I thought I was Superman and tried to lift a heavy footlocker all by myself . But I exercise it every morning . . . there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a little inconvenient here , a little small .. . " You see , I do n't spend too much time here . " " Here " is the office of the " Citizens of Illinois for Otto Kerner , " a group of people the former governor calls friends ? people who are raising money for his legal defense , a defense Kerner calls " fantastically expensive ; a defense that has drained nearly all my personal assets . " AND this is Otto Kerner today , 64 , and stillthe very proper , very formal man , sitting in the small and almost hidden office  --  down the hall , around the corner , in the dark and dingy alcove ? who sits up straight and sets his jaw and hangs on to his past with porous hands , trying very hard to let the bad times slide thru . The good ti es were many for the man who watched his father rise in Public office to Illinois attorney general and United States Court of Appeals judge , a man whose home was visited often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago mayor 's daughter and retired from the National Guard as a major general . A man who watched his own political career skyrocket , becoming the United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , a Cook County judge , and then a two-term governor who resigned in 1968 to accept an appointment as a judge in the U. S. Court of Appeals . A man who achieved national fame when he headed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and blamed black unrest on " white racism . " And he is the man who sat in court thru bitter winter months this year , accused of tax evasion , conspiracy , bribery , and mail fraud . Ho is the man who watched a U. S. District Court jury call him guilty . And he watched a judge sentence him to three years in prison . That is the hardest memory of all , a memory that clings beneath his gray hair no matter how hard he tries to let It slide thru his hands . " IT WAS a very difficult feeling . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishbowl with high morals and ethics I set for myself , and then after all that , after all those years , it was very hard  --  most difficult  --  when the people did n't believe me , when that jury did n't believe me . " Later in the interview , when he slides into talk about the trial , his face will harden and he will remember the people testifying against him , telling " bald-faced lles " - on the stand to " save their own necks . " He will talk about how he believes the Nixon administration is using the Internal Revenue Service to further its own political aims . And he will say he knew from the very beginning that an intense investigation into his financial dealings was under way . He will talk about his future and about facing jail  --  all difficult , tough moments . Difficult moments . Otto Kerner 's are wedged like signposts among the wrinkles in his face  --  wrinkles come lately ? and he mixed them yesterday with the easy moments in the small office that has a breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his boyhood to his record as governor to his trial ; carving the figure of a man who lives In the stony coffin of his accomplishments , a man who Is forcing his life to move ahead day by day while it uncontrollably winds down to a new and very private existence . AND THE winding down is n't coming easily  --  maybe not as easily as the spectacular climb was when he was younger . For he admits that " the job always came first  --  it always had top priority . " So I come here a few hours a day , assisting in whatever way I can  --  these people are raising money for my legal defense . You know , I was never a rich man to begin with  --  oh , I was able to save some money at various times in my life ? but all this has been fantastically expensive . " Weil , these people  --  my friends  --  felt all my years in public office warranted the help , and they came to me . I never asked . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the downstate area  --  and I 'm spending the rest of my time at home , taking care of personal items that were sadly neglected , because my job always bad top priority . I 'm spending time with Mrs. Kerner and my mother ? my family  --  and some time in the garden . I enjoy gardening . " The garden . The family . The background of Otto Kerner 's life moving suddenly to the foreground , and there is nothing he can do about It , and he leans back in his chair and lights another cigaret and talks about the beginnings . ? " I WAS raised in a family where the atmosphere was public service  --  it was my father 's life and an interesting atmosphere , and I went places with my father and drove him around during campaigns . I met Gov . Horner , who came often to the house and ate with us . But my father made me choose my own way  --  he never pushed . Of course , he did have an effect  --  the FEEL of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly into his years as U. S. attorney and county judge , using a memory for detail , dredging up names , specific cases , specific feeIngs ? " I remember when I was county judge , the adoption rings were so prevalent then . They upset me very much , " and he mouths the word " upset " very slowly , drawing out the sound and the feeling . Then he is suddenly on his feet , his erect body following an outstretched head rummaging thru the unpacked cartons for The Book ? " because I hate to get the figures incorrect . " Back to a chair in front of a table , thumbing thru the book , a loose-leaf binder , bound in plastic , and titled , " The Kerner Record . " His whole expression tells the story of The Book . It is the bedrock of Otto Kerner 's history as a man ? . his code of honor and his list of accomplishments , all bound up in blue plastic . Ho leafs thru the book , and it is like leafing thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state while he was its governor and revitalizing the economy , recalling the names of companies that moved their plants here , recalling how much money the companies invested . " . .. SO , AS I was saying , we improved the unemploy- - ment picture tremendously , and by late ' 63 and early ' 64 we reduced it to a little below 3 per cent , down from over 7 per cent when I became governor . Now those are not exact figures , but they are in the proper area , the proper area . " Then the good times were gone . The pages were turned and the book was closed . It left only the rest  --  the trial and the conviction  --  and Otto Kerner leaned back and swatted his own smoke from his eyes and smiled that strange kind of smile a man does when his eyes wo n't go along for the laugh . " The trial . . oh no , it has n't changed ' my outlook , it really has n't changed me , personally , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the case has n't affected that ... the human problems I have dealt with .. I just hope that as I passed thru this world I have left it a little better off than it was . " And I 'm not cynical . I 've seen movements before  --  lived thru them , read about theta . The abuse of power is an old story , and as long as human beings are what they are , some people will abuse it . This time the abuse of it hurt me . ? " BUT I STILL have faith , and I still have great faith in people and in what I havp been able to accornplish . No trial or charges will alter that . " But thoughts of the trial are altering his voice , it is becoming quick , and the words are clipped and the pauses to think vanish . " I suppose I was n't really surprised when the agents first came to my office . I had heard from a newsman in December , 1969 , that an investigation was being opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internal Revenue Service telling him I was aware . He replied in a very noncommittal way and so . . . well , I suppose I was shocked when the . agents came . " I knew it was n't routine  --  you must remember , I was a U. S. attorney myself  --  and when the agent told me that he had to check in every day with Washington to report the progress of the case , I knew it was n't routine at all . In all my years as U. S. attorney I never had to call Washington every day on any case . " Ile stopped , stared for a moment , grabbed another cigaret , lighted it , and snapped the lighter shut . " It was difficult to sit there in that courtroom and watch people on the stand tell bald-faced lies to save their own necks . " That .. . THAT was the most difficult part of all . I was n't despairing  --  you must remember , I am not an infant ? but some people will do anything to save their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was definitely the worst part of all . " AND THEN , 01 ' course , the verdict . The verdict ? Well , any lawyer knows that 8 guilty verdict is always possible . Always possible . but I do object to what I thitfR-was done . You have heard in recent weeks  --  in the Watergate testimony ? how President Nixon tried to use the IRS for his own political gain . I know this to be the case . I know that Nixon has made the HIS an adjunct to the Republican Party . And it is frightening . Frightening , this abuse of power . " Then for the first time his fist slams into the table , for he says there has been additional harassment from the government . He recalls U. S. Atty . James Thompson 's crossexamination , he in the witness box , Thompson standing in front of him , asking him if he donated his governor 's papers 4o the state historical society , asking if he look a tax credit on them . " I had donated them and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can name others  --  Lyndon Johnson , for example  --  who did the same : " Well , a few days after the trial  --  here , let me show you the document  --  I received this letter from IRS staling that my tax credit was n't being allowed , No reason stated , as you can see . Just additional harassment , plain and simple . So we have filed an appeal on-this in Tax Court in Washington . " And there are also the appeals on his conviction , still playing themselves out and far from exhausted . If he wins them , lie says Ito will return to the bench . " SURELY , I WILL return to the bench . I MIA this whole experience will make me a better judge  --  a better protector of the individual 's rights . You know . . . the government can be wrong . " And if it is jail , well , I wIl have to go thru Um% in . And if it is , Otto Kerner 's beliefs and feelings wo n't change  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime to cultivate . I have great faith that those feelings will never change . " Then Ito is back to the book ... " this is what I have done , this is what I have done , " and the typewriter clael ; s and he thumbs thru the pages of his life , and in the middle of a sentence about his welfare reforms , he shuts Book again . " You know , time passes and people forget so qtdetdy . Yesterday I was at a party , a charity affair , and a woman walke up to me and said , ' You look familiar , who are you ? ' Anil I said to her , ' Well , I do n't know how I look , but I can tell you what I have done . ' " Otto Kerner stood in the doorway of ids small office by the ? lake , saying goodby , holding his cigaret in one hand , his bask in the other , hanging on lo one set of facts and waiting for thoMext set to come rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
