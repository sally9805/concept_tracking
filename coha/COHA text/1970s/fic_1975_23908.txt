The 900 million dollar man This is horno sapiens in 1975 . Immunizations can add 10 years to his or her life expectancy . He or she can mature without the threats of polio or measles or diphtheria . Many maladies that used to kill or cripple can now be controlled . So much so that past generations would call him or her superhuman . But are all those break-through medicines enough ? The member companies of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association do n't think so . Not with complicated diseases like arthritis and cancers and cardiovascular illnesses still very much with us . Because of that , we are investing something like 900 million dollars of our own money this year to find new medicines and improve existing ones . A considerable figure , especially when you realize it 's been increasing at an average rate of nearly 60 million dollars a year for the last ten years . More important than money is our people investment . Right now in our companies there are 23,000 highly-trained scientific and support people working in pharmaceutic research , half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you have reason to expect results .

The new companies grew , the Bell affiliated companies grew , the confusion grew . Growth brought financial problems . Earnings , handsome as they were , were insufficient to finance such rapid expansion . ( The telephone industry is a capital intensive industry ) Bell management borrowed more and more money from big banks . By 1907 , lenders were getting hard to find . Then came the Panic of 1907 . To protect their interests , the bankers demanded that telephone management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation . That year there were 3,132,000 Bell telephones in service . Vail 's return to command restored the financial community 's confidence in the Bell company , so towering was the reputation he had built . Improving the quality of the service was his first concern . He made sure that concern was understood by Bell people throughout the land . Thanks totheirtefforts , and investment in needed equipment , service improved . Further improvement depended on improving telephone technology . Research was going on in various parts of the company , in various cities . To encourage better planning and coordination , Vail unified the research effort . And he directed the researchers to examine at once a new device , the audion tube invented by Dr. Lee De Forest . Working with De Forest , telephone researchers developed the vacuum tube electronic amplifier , which greatly extended the range of long distance service , and led in time to commercial radio and television . Duplicate telephone companies in various towns were incompatible with good service . Waterworks and electric companies were recognized as " public utilities ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reasoning applied to the telephone industry . He set out to eliminate the duplication by buying out the rival companies where that was possible , or selling out to them in some towns if that was the only way . In 1913 , as a step toward universal service , he agreed to allow the independent ( non-Bell ) companies to use the Bell long distance lines . Now Vail could speak confidently of a telephone system rather than a large number of isolated , unconnected telephone companies . He was the first to use the phrase " Bell System . " He could look to the day when telephone service would be well within the means of the average American . And that gave him the final element in his planning : he could make long-range estimates of the needs of his customers . The chain was complete : research and development , an efficient source of supply in the Western Electric Company and total responsibility for installation , maintenance and repair in the local companies . Because Vail could plan in this way , the company could invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in research for predictable future growth . The Bell System continues today in the pattern Vail set . Not as a matter of tradition , but because the concept works . We are planning today American telephone service for the 21st Century . Western Electric and the associated Bell Companies are installing new electronic switching systems nationwide , which make possible many additional telephone services . Scientists and engineers at Bell Laboratories , birthplace of the first electrical digital computer and the transistor , are working now on new technology to transmit telephone calls on a beam of light , to handle calling volumes expected by the year 2000 . Research , manufacturing , operations ? one Bell System , a planned approach that works . Efficiency and productivity are well ahead of the average for all other Electronic switching systems , a thousand limes faster than the equipment they replace , are now being installed across the nation . industries , the system is the best in the world . There are two tests you can make yourself to see if the Bell System really works : Compare telephone prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years . Long distance service is one of the few things that have hardly gone up at all . Other telephone services have gone up far less than the price of almost anything else you buy . The economics of a planned telephone system have surely been to the customer 's benefit . What about the service ? Well , just pick up your telephone . Call any number in the United States . The best telephone system in the world did n't just happen . It was planned that way . One Bell System . It works . options . They were walking toward Wisconsin Avenue , she said she wanted an ice-cream cone . He 'd been talking in Iow tones , as much to himself as to her . He sorted the problems in a lawyerlike way , attempting to establish the sequence of events , the priorities , and the motives of those involved . At last he said . " Tom thinks the Bomber is a double agent . " She was startled but said nothing . " It 's the only explanation that fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't always clear-cut . " She nodded , pressing up against him in the dark ; she was following him with difficulty . " Tom thinks he wants to sabotage the agreement . Thai 's in the long run . " " And the short ? " " Well , his knowledge could be useful on the Hill . To the opposition . It 's delicate , damn embarrassing if it should leak bekre signing . Afterward it 's all right . The odd thing is this . If we get the agreement , it 's small beer ; minor-league stuff . But there 's a catch in it . They know it and we know it . The principle that we 're establishing  --  never mind what it is  --  could be very important . It 's a principle that will not be acknowledged in any communique or press conference , even if we were to have one , which of course we wo n't . Still , they 'll know it and we 'll know it . We 'll try it and see if it works . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specifically acknowledge what 's been understood all along . " And the Bomber ? " Mills shrugged . " I do n't know what game he 's playing . " " But you think he 'll leak it ... " " Not that simple . It 's what Tom meant when he called him a double agent . " Mills looked at his wife and wondered how much of this she truly understood . " Sal , this is so sensitive ... " She smiled woodenly . " I have been known to keep a secret . " " Be sure you keep this one . You know , we 've used the Bomber as liaison to our friends in the Senate , particularly the one who 's running for the Presidency . Comprends ? " He felt her impatience , but lie was determined to spell everything out . " They are friends . He likes the Bomber , the Bomber likes him . That 's why when something particularly sensitive comes along we use the Bomber for a little missionary work with his friend the candidate , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and , uh , ' belt a fifth , ' as I believe the Bomber puts it . Well , would n't it be funny as hell if the Bomber is doing double duty ? " Mills paused , listening to their footsteps on the brick sidewalk . " If he 's working against us on the inside for his good friend the candidate ... " He shrugged again . She looked at him , solemn enough , but with a hint of amusement in her eyes . " What can you doabout it ? " " Me ? " " You , " she said . " Nothing . Not one damned thing . " " But you 're at the center of it . " " As a lawyer , Sal . I 'm the one drawing up the options because I 'm the only one in the government who understands the ... legal modalities . The way it has to be written . This other business , that 's out of my league . I 'm not touching that with a ten-foot pole . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again . " Maybe . But in government you understand limitations . " " I do n't understand that . " They 'd stopped , pausing under a street lamp , speaking now in whispers . A taxi pulled up to the curb , then slid away . " There is n't anything I can do about it , " he said . " What am supposed to do ? Walk up to him and ask him if he 's working for the opposition ? That would be the end of my work on this project , probably the end of my career in government . The single disadvantage of anonymity : if no one knows you 're there , no one knows when you 're gone . " fie lit cigarettes for them both , cupping the match though there was no breeze in the silent street . " And I have no evidence . What I have is Tom Horne 's hunch . His suspicion . And as you know very well , Tom wrote the book on conspiracy theory . " " And Tom is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 'll just let it go , then . You 'll walk away from it . " " A bsolutely . " She said , " What can Tom do ? " " More than me . " " Why ? " she asked . " Why more than you ? " " He 's more visible , " Mills said wearily . " He 's a member of the Foreign Service . He understands the politics of it . I can be more useful to Tom on the inside than breaking dishes on the outside . " He paused . Then , " Tom 's protected . There 's no way they can get him . " She said nothing for a moment . When she spoke , her voice was loud , almost strident . " Is it worth it to you ? The way you 've run your life in the government , always on the inside ... " " Perfectly ' satisfied , " he said stubbornly . " Well , at a time like this ... " " Christ , SaI -- these are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , we 'll just try it again next year . " She said , " If you only ... " Then , " I thought you said it might lead to something important . " " Might , Sal . The word is might . " " It 's a possibility , though . " " That is right . " " Or was , " she said . " It is n't any longer . " They 'd begun walking again and when they approached the ice-cream parlor they saw it was closed , the interior dark , the marble counter bare . Silently they turned and walked up N Street to their house . Their house , this street ; two familiar things , as familiar as an old suit of clothes . He turned first to climb the stoop and she remained on the sidewalk , lost in thought He stood in the hallway , his back to her . She looked at his back , then at the city sky . She said , " You know , I must he getting out of touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what I thought you meant ? For a moment , I thought you meant he was a Communist . Until you explained it , I thought you meant he was a foreign enemy . " She smiled wanly . " That means one of two things . Either I have been too long in this town , or you have . " H E CHARACTERISTIC kT , LY left his house at six , to be at his desk in the D Ring at six-thirty . He 'd drink halfa-dozen cups of coffee before eight-thirty , when the morning conferences began . Military people were always up at first light arid the civilians were obliged to follow . In that early-morning period , Mills read and thought . And reviewed the bidding . He and Sal , they had come to Washington in a different time . Washington was different , they were different . Or perhaps it was only that they had n't understood the town . When she 'd given him the Goya it was to remind him of their early dreams . And to remind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd needed reminders ; they were very close in all ways . And they 'd endured . Through all seasons , and that was a fact more important than any other . They 'd arrived in the capital a year before the idealistic multitudes ; it seemed an eon ago . An officer of the court , Mills saw himself as part of a continuing process and tradition . Working for that old man was like working for a national monument . The justice had said once , Responsibility , an interesting legal concept . A man is drowning . You are standing on the beach , a life preserver in lour hand . You are under absolutely no legal obligation to throw it to the drowning man . On that point , the law is indiOerent . However , if you do throw it you 'd better damn well be sure you do n't hit him on the head with it . If you choose to assume responsibility , then you 're obliged to proceed with prudence , all reasonable care and caution . He understood her dilemma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the pink ribbons to reach the heart of the problem . Except the pink ribbons , the bureaucracy , the maneuver , was the problem . And one did not " slice through " it , either ; one dealt with it as delicately as a lapidary with a diamond . Hit it too hard , and it disintegrated and you were left with nothing . Stand fast , she 'd said . And the truth was , he had an urge to run . It was an urge that he kept under strict control because if he ran it would be from everything . Every single thing . In the bottom drawer of his desk he 'd collected scores of travel folders ; they were concealed as other men might conceal French postcards . No question , he 'd been very careful with drowning men . But he 'd said to her the night before , " I understand what you mean ... about this thing with Horne . I 'll talk to him tomorrow . I do n't think it 's possible , but perhaps together just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hardly knows where to begin . " He 'd described to her the practical difficulties , laying them out with precision . At the end of it she 'd moved closer to him . There was something strange in her voice , and he was surprised to realize that it was fear . She 'd whispered , " Of course . " He brought his mind back to the present . She 'd not been entirely wrong . There were times to stand fast . Cod knows he did not need the government , his law practice flourished in all seasons . He swiveled in his chair and stared at the lime-green walls behind him , and the table with the pictures . His wife and children , grinning into a professional 's camera . He and the two others with Mikoyan . The old man in his soft black robes , a cigarette incongruous in his right fist . Mills smiled broadly , comfortable among his photographs . He stared at the Goya , entirely familiar with it ; he looked at it every working day of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier obscure in half-tones . The white light on the telephone winked , and then burned steadily . His secretary answered , surely it was Horne . Presently he heard the buzzer . " I did n't mean to interrupt , " his wife said . Her voice was strained , as it always was when she called him at the office . She 'd called to remind him of a party that evening . They were due at seven-thirty : their hostess had asked that they not he late . Was that all right with him ? He said that would be fine ; he would be home at the usual time . Tentative laughter in her voice , she asked him if Home had called . No , Home had not called . Well , all right , she said . Just curious . Just curious as to the state of play . The white light was winking again . His secretary hurried in and slipped a piece of paper in front of him . Mr. Horne is lwIding . He held up his forefinger  --  one minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the office ? Say hi . "
