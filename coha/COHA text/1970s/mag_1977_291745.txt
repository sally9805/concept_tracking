Here Come the Joys of Summer <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> " Here Comes Summer " July 4 - excellent ! Finally an interesting , in-depth article that does not discover a new American problem , ailment or cause to preach on . Nor does it present a view of America in trite , sugar-coated homilies-just reality , professionally spiced with some enjoyable , entertaining and individual perceptions . <P> <P> Richard Panek El Granada , Calif . <P> <P> Your cover story on summer describes theme parks as " fun and fantasy . " We have lived in Southern California for twelve years and watched nearly everything encapsulate itself within a plastic bubble : not only giant " pop Xanadus " like Universal Studios , but also miniature golf courses , shopping centers and finally the American home . Vicarious living drives me up a tree , which , by the way , used to be a great source of fun and fantasy . So did tide-pools , hopscotch and lightning bugs . <P> <P> Kathryn Brock San Diego <P> Swimsuits ?

But I 'd prefer to see some male skin , male string bikinis . How about some equal time ? <P> <P> Marilyn Tressel Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Fiery Abortion Debate <P> Dollars-and-cents logic is irrelevant when discussing the willful termination of human life July 4 . The taxpayer has spoken . I will no longer be an accomplice to murder . More money for contraception , not I e more for abortion . <P> <P> Joann Crocker Buffalo <P> Justice Thurgood Marshall and others who advocate abortion rather than letting a child live in poverty should realize that it is better to have lived poor than never to have lived at all . <P> <P> John J. Lydon West Chester , Pa . <P> <P> Abortion can be made illegal , but this simply puts such operations into the hands of " get rich quick " butchers , instead of competent physicians . <P> <P> Pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret in the U.S. is that abortion is legal up to and including the ninth month of pregnancy . In 1973 the Supreme Court said that in the first three months states can not interfere . In the second three months they may regulate , but not prohibit , abortions . In the last three months they may prohibit abortions in the interest of the baby 's life . Some states , however , allow abortions through nine months . <P> <P> Betty La Rosa <P> New Jersey Right to Life Committee Westfield , N.J. <P> <P> Antiabortionists should put themselves on the line and sign up at Medicaid centers to raise , feed , clothe and educate the children they wish to " save . " After all , if they care so much , they would n't want to see these children grow up in homes in the slums with too little food , or heat or education-not to mention love-would they ? <P> <P> Mary Schultz San Francisco <P> Women have been controlled by pregnancy for centuries .
