txt The Carter Administration is finally showing signs of life in facing up to inflation . The Secretaries of Treasury , Labor and Commerce and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers have held the first major meeting with the Labor-Management Group created by the White House last April to shape a national antiinflation policy . It is far from certain that very much can be done to reduce the pace of inflation , but at least the President 's emissaries recognized that the judgment could not be left to the Labor-Management Group alone . After creating the group , the Administration largely deferred to it and particularly to its chairman , Prof. John T. Dunlop of Harvard , the former Secretary of Labor . The Government promised to shave two points off the inflation rate by 1979 but offered no plan to get from here ( 6 percent ) to there ( 4 percent ) . A growing doubt that this goal could be achieved undoubtedly hastened the search for some kind of new policy initiative . A midyear economic review by the Office of Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent inflation rate off to late 1980 . Most private economists think even that date is optimistic . The Administration also realized that if left alone , Mr. Dunlop and his group were unlikely to hit upon any means of reducing inflation by 1980 . Mr. Dunlop stands with the majority of economists , who think the inflation rate will not go lower in the next few years . Indeed , he believes that pattern-setting wage settlements of roughly 10 percent a year in major industries , such as steel and autos , must be allowed to ripple through the economy until their contracts come up for renegotiation in late 1979 and 1980 . He also believes that a governmental initiative to hold down prices would be counterproductive , stimulating business to push up prices as a precaution against controls . Secretary Blumenthal of Treasury , fortunately , resists these conclusions . " If you accepted that point of view fully , you would never do anything , " he said last week . The fact is that nonunion workers , who make up . the great bulk of the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are businesses required by some iron law of economics to push up prices and profit margins as fast as they do in responding to cost pressures . Clearly , White House economists want to pressure business and labor leaders into helping devise a remedy for inflation . To judge by Mr. Blumenthal 's comments , however , the White House would consider Government action if inflation heats up unless the Labor-Management team can propose a joint strategy . There is no certainty that anything can work , with or without the cooperation of big labor and big business . Economists throughout the non-Communist industrial world have been frustrated so far in the search for a way to reduce inflation while economies expand . But it is encouraging to see the Administration join the search . So far , because of Mr. Dunlop 's primacy , ideas for restraining wages and prices have received little attention in the Administration . A Presidential goal needs a supporting plan or it might as well be written off .                 @ @ @ @
