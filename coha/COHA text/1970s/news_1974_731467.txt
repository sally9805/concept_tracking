txt Vice-President Gerald R. Ford , in an interview with this newspaper just minutes before the Supreme Court decision , said he thought the President should supply the 64 tapes In question . " I ca n't tell you If he will or not , " he told the Monitor . " . . . If the court rules against the president , it is my belief he ought to comply " ? A : , ' , ; ( ? ( 1 the unpii ( t would he if the President defied the court , he said " I think the odds would shift materially in favor of impeachment . " I I ir 4. opposed Asked whether he thought Republican Rep Lawrence J. Hogan should he " purged " by the Republican Party or the While House , the Vice-President said : " Oh , I would vigorously disagree with that In fact , lust Friday down in Roanoke , Va. , I stood with the two Republican members of the House , Bill William C. ) Wampler and M , Caldwell Butler . Butler Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when I was asked whether I would come back and campaign for Butler if he voted to impeach the President , I said there were other Important Issues that would have to By R Norman Matheny , staff photographer Ford : Nixon should comply he in the formula and if I thought on the broad spectrum he deserved whatever help I could give , I 'd come hack . " To the question : " What is It the American people really want In terms of national purpose , " the VIce-Prenident replied : " I think they want reassurance that the United States is the great country they really believe in , And I think they realize that In foreign policy we have been spectacularly successful . " But they do have some doubts about our capability to handle such problems as inflation ; and they want reassurance that we are going to solve these domestic problems in particular . " I think they will get that reassurance ; but they are hungering for that reassurance , They believe America is great , but skeptics and cynics and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want reassurance through leadership that Ameri  --  a is everything they 've read about and believed in . " On the subject of the " flavor " of the White House tape transcripts , the Vice-President had this to say . " I do n't think the content of the tapes put sainthood on anybody . " I think they 're not the way I would have hoped the discussions would be carried out in the Oval Office . " The thing that is small but I think It is significant : In none of the tapes or transcripts that I 've seen did you see people who were there say ' Mr. President . ' " " I happen to think in deference to the office even people as close as that group ought to refer to the President as ' Mr. President . ' I do , I know others do . And that , which is small , bothered me as much as anything .

I was sitting at that desk . Bob Hartman of my staff brought in one of these ticker-tape slips saying that Hogan was going to have a press conference , I think at 3 o'clock . I called Larry . No presidential request " There was n't a request from the President for you to step in ? " " No Bob brought this slip in and showed to to me . It did n't indicate what Hogan was going to say except he was having a press conference . I came to the conclusion he probably was going to indicate his support for impeachment . I called him . He was not available . " He called back . And I said , ' Larry , I do n't know what you are going to take as a public position . I think it is wrong as a member of that committee to do it prematurely . You 're a member of that committee . " ' The public expects you to listen to all the arguments that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for you to make a public announcement at the present time is ill-advised , ill-timed , and I would hope you would n't do it . I 'm not arguing whether you 're going to do this or that . I just think your timing is wrong ' " And I still think it was wrong . And I think he 'll find that it was wrong . " " How about the impact of the Hogan position ? Is n't it likely to persuade some other Republicans in the House to vote for impeachment ? " " It may . It may . On the other hand , it could backlash. "
