txt China Tribune Press Service MONTGOMERY . Ala. ? George Corley Wallace is happily running for President again , and for residents of the state he ? has headed for 11 of the last 13 years now , it 's nothing new . George Wallace runs happily for office every two years  --  either for governor or for president . And if be does n't win the presidency this time Ibis fourth try , he 'll probably run happily again in two years  --  maybe for the United States Senate . And if Wallace does win the preside* cy , so the saying goes in Alabama , he will be the most unhappy commander in chief since Alexander the Great broke into tears 2,000 years ago when he ran out of kingdoms to conquer . " George Wallace does n't want to be President of the United States , " one state official says . " He just wants to rim for President of the United States . " AFTER MORE THAN a decade under his leadership a number of residents of Alabama believe that Wallace also pre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace seldom talks about things other governors talk about . Other governors discuss budgets , bills , and vetoes . Wallace , even in an off-election year , talks about busing , taxes , bureaucrats , and the All-American " little guY . ' George C. Wallace , as one critic pats it , is the ungovernor of Alabama " This state has marked time for 13 years , " Jobe Peter Kohn says . Rohn , who broke with Wallace in 1971 , helped the Alabama governor 13 years ago when he stood on the University of Alabama steps and refused  --  for a while , at least ? to let two black students enroll . " HE WANTS to be out there on the ' campaign trail where he can spread his politics of hate , " says the Montgomery attorney , who is still an arch and vocal segregationist . " George Wallace is a hater . He knows how to pinch the boil on the face of American politics . " There is some disagreement In Alabama about bow Wallace entices voters to the polls , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . George Wallace is one of the most popular governors in Alabama 's torrid political history . He was elected in a laarialiric vote ' two years ago when even some of the blacks  --  Ibc same peepla Wallace had tried to exclude 10 years ago  --  voted for him . " FOLKS TEND to put aside the past , " Tuskeegee 's black mayor , Johnny Ford , explains . " I differ with George Wallace at some issues , but he 's a man of his word in politics and that 's often ' what counts . " " At least now , we can sit down and talk about our differences , " explains Ford . whose mostly black county went for Wallace in 1974 . " It used to be if we differed with a governor , we 'd be shot . In some ways , we 've come a long way . " In other ways , Alabama has a long way to go . In 1963 , when Wallace w-s fast elected to the statehouse , Alabama bad more illiterates per 1,000 residents than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the same illiteracy rate today as it had in 1963 . State income hai improved somewhat . In 1961 , Alabama ranked 46th of the 50 states in average income per resident . But even after Wallace 's extensive push to bring industry to the state , the income rank has only risen one place  --  to 45th in the country . ' Me percentage of Alabamarta living in poverty is the same now as when Wallace was first elected . When these and oner statistics abed the state are printed , Wallace and his staff often blame the people who print them . " THE NEWEST TRICK of the press is to attack the State of Alabama because George C. Wallace is governor , " Charles Snider , Wallace 's national campaign director , said recently in a flyer sent to thousands of contributors . " According to these liberal and extreme Left noisemakers , Alabama is next door to Dogpatch . " Snider then says Alabama lender Wallace has made more progress than a majority of the other states , and his first piece of evidence is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alabama is famous nationally for two of the finest football teams in the nation  --  Auburn University War Eagles and University of Alabama Crimson Tide , " be begins . SNIDER THEN MENTIONS the football team of Troy State University , a predominantly black school , and adds that Alabama has " one of the nation 's finest higher education systems " to create such football teams . Wallace takes mach the same tact as his campaign manager . " The New York Times says Pm not a good governor , " he tells crowds in Mississippi and Massachusetts . ' Well , I do n't listen to the New York Times . New York City has been listening to the New York Times though , and look what happened to them . They went bankrupt . You do n't hear anything about Alabama going bankrupt , now do you ? " IN MISSISSIPPI and Massachusetts , that argument draws cheers , but to some Alabama state officials it 's not so encouraging . Albania 's state debt when Wallace took over was $215,600,000 . Now it is $873,184,800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost constant state of emergency for more than a year . " The man 's the biggest deficit spender since Lyndon Johnson , " says one state official concerned with finances . " He 's delayed paying off because he thought he 'd be out of office by the time the bills were due . " Wallace has strongly opposed a higher income or property tax ; so the big revenue comes from a 6 per cent consumer products tax , including medicine and food . The consumer tax generally hits the poor and middle-income families the hardest . " T 'M A GOOD ENOUGH governor of my state not to take money from the working people and throw it to saeial experiments for those who would n't work if they could fend a job , " Wallace boasted in Massachusetts last week . Part of the reason Wallace does n't take money from working people of Alabama ? especially the wealthier ones ? is that his state does take money from working people elsewhere . According to state estimates , Alabama gets $2 to $2.50 back for every $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares to about 50 cents returned for every Si sent to Washington by such large industrial states as Illinois and New Jersey . If Wallace has trouble with his state 's ? tax structure , be has fared a lot better with Alabama 's school system . " BEFORE WALLACE was governor . kids had to buy their own textbooks , " says one critic of the governor who , nevertheless , approves of the advances in education . " It was really bard on ' poor kids , and often teachers changed . the textbooks from year to year so that students could n't sell them used or pass them on to brothers and sisters . " Today , youngsters get free textbooks in Alabama 's public schools ? an advancement that can make a big difference to a barefoot child in Anniston , Ala . Wallace and his supporters have pushed for a network of junior colleges throughout the state . He boasts that he has brought a junior college education within busing distance of every young Alahaman SOME OF WALLACE 'S other boasts . however , have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Club , Wallace took credit for " giant steps forward " in the state 's mental health program . He noted that in the last five years , money for mental health in Alabama has increased from about $10 million a year to about $40 million . But he failed to note that United States District Judge Frank Johnson ordered the increase . Johnson , who knew Wallace when they were both students at the University of Alabama , is known among liberals in the state as " the real govermor. of Alabama . " What Wallace does not do in the statehouse , Johnson does in the courts . they say . JOHNSON ORDERED the desegregation of schools and the state police . He made Wallace revalue property for income tax . He ordered the governor in clean up an industrial school for dealquent children , and , more recently , he demanded changes in the state prison system . Wallace , who bristles at charges that Johnson runs the state while he runs for President , held a press conference in Montgomery a few weeks ago and voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As usual . the governor was direct . " A good vote for George Wallace might give . A political barbed wire enema to some of these federal judges , " be told the press . It is statements like that one that cause some reporters and Wallace 's political friends to believe that the George Wallace of 1976 is as tough as the George Wallace of 1972 ? before Arthur Bremer fired five shots and turned him into a paraplegic . AND WHILE Wallace 's critics hint that he is too weak to run the state , the governor 's favorite comeback is , - The only thing that 's ' different about me now is that I ca n't walk . " George Wallace can run for President , however , and his wife , Cornelia , believes that running for President is the best thing that has happened to her husband since he ran for governor two years ago . " I want him to rim , " she told The Chicago Tribune last year before be announced his seventh campaign in the last 14 years . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George alive . "
