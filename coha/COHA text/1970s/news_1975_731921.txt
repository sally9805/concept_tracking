txt The rush is on . After weeks of doubt or disbelief , many South Vietnamese have concluded that Communist control is inevitable  --  and sooner rather than later . For many , that means trying to get out any way they can . More than 150,000 Communist troops surround Saigon , and at some places they are within 20 miles of the refugee-swollen city . For the first time , parts of the city are in range of the insurgents ' deadly , Sovietmade 130 mm. guns . There is little doubt that the city could be taken with only two or three days of heavy fighting . The Communists have held off , however , apparently hoping that the South Vietnamese government will soon agree to give up without a fight . North Vietnamese and VietCong troops have continued to advance against government forces without committing anything near their total force . The South Vietnamese are finally moving toward accommodation with some of the Communists ' demands . President Nguyen Van Thieu and his cabinet resigned this week , and Mr. Thieu 's first successor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is no assurance that any new government can or will negotiate a ceasefire . So the people try to flee . " It is just like China in 1949 , " says one U.S. embassy official . " You 're witnessing a massive liquidation of assets as people try to scrape up dollars for:their escape . " - Accordingly , the black-market rate has soared to about 3,300 piasters to the U.S. dollar , or more than four times the legal rate of 755 and almost twice what . was being offered earlier this week . Store owners are scrambling to unload inventory . Cameras , radios and other durable goods are selling at one-fifth their normal cost . Even gold is available on illegal markets at about $85 an ounce , or little more than half the world market price . Two Banks Close Offices ( In the U.S. , spokesmen for American financial institutions operating in Saigon said that they have either closed their offices or that they are open on an hour-to-hour basis . Chase Manhattan Bank and Bank of America closed their Saigon branches at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " As far as I knovi , our office is now closed . " ( First National City Bank said its office is still open but could n't predict how long this would last . None of the financial institutions has American nationals on the scene any longer . As for the Vietnamese who have been running the offices , the banks are understood to be trying to help them leave if they wish . ( For example , Bank of America late yesterday said it evacuated to Guam 11 of its Vietnamese executives and their families  --  a total of 101 persons . The bank had 37 Vietnamese on its staff in Saigon . The 11 were chosen , the bank said , because it concluded they were the most susceptible to retaliation by Communist forces . ) Unlike China , of course , there is n't any Taiwan nearby for those who want to flee . But there are U.S. military planes flying out of Saigon 's Tan Son Nhut Airport around the clock . And people think that dollars can get them on planes and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S , evacuation , however , is primarily for Americana and their Vietnamese dependents . There are reports that some wealthy and prominent South Vietnamese have also managed to get on the flights . In any case , however , the number of such Vietnamese is far.smaller than the number who want to go . Some Are Angered Nonetheless , the reports have angered some Americans still here and some Vietnamese who oppose any evacuation of South Vietnamese . " I have a bad feeling in my mouth about the U.S. embassy , " says Robert A. Cerabone , who ran-a small trading company here . He ca n't get out 16 South Vietnamese with whom he lives while he claims " powerful , influential people " are getting out . One antigovernment , anti-Communist South Vietnamese politician , who opposes evacuation of any Vietnamese nationals , adds that the American airlift is becoming " an affront to South Vietnamese dignity . " Outside the U.S. embassy here , thousands of people stand in interminable lines seeking exit visas . Each person has a special plea for consideration . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military during the late 1960s and fears that he will be punished if '  --  a Communist government comes to power . A university professor says he should get a visa because he has relatives in the U.S. he can live with . Women in search of American husbands are offering $5,000 to $10,000 to anyone willing to marry them and get them out of the country . Engagements , which only entitle the Vietnamese fiancee to a six-month temporary visa , are in high demand too , but less money is offered . But in most cases the reasons and pleas for exit visas are n't persuasive to the embassy . Besides the staff is so busy getting its own Vietnamese employes out of the country that there is n't much time to deal with anyone else . Several thousand persons a day are being flown out of South Vietnam , and the American embassy here says it wants to keep the evacuation going as long as possible . Although there are only about 1,000 Americans left in Saigon , many more dependents are still here . How long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be moved out of the country , will rest on military and political developments largely out of the Americans ' control . Two of the Communists ' demands  --  the removal of U.S. civilian and military personnel and the resignation of President Thieu and his cabinet  --  have almost been met . They have also objected to Mr. Thieu 's successor as president , Tran Van Huong , but there has been a lot of pressure on Mr. Huong to resign . This has come from the U.S. and French embassies and from neutralist opposition political forces in Saigon . He is expected Co accede grudgingly to the demands soon . Retired Gen. Duong Van " Big " Minh has emerged as the leading candidate to head a new government in negotiations with the Communists . Mr. Minh , who served briefly as head of state after leading the coup that overthrew and killed President Ngo Dinh Diem 12 years ago , is considered incompetent by many foreigners and Vietnamese politicians . But he heads a Buddhist-oriented group that has been advocating negotiation with the Communists for several yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Communists ca n't say he is part of the Thieu clique , " . a foreign diplomat says . Gen. Minh yesterday was offered the job of premier , by President Huong , but sources reported that Gen. Minh rejected it , saying he would take the presidency or nothing . Although Mr. Minh is one of the few politicians with any chance of being accepted by the Communists , his efforts to head a new government are being opposed by many Catholic groups and by some of the Vietnamese generals , including former Premier Nguyen Cao Ky . If he does succeed in forming a new government , it is very Ukely that the Catholics will continue to oppose One of South Vietnam 's many tragedies is that its opposition parties have never been able to agree on anything . And so far there is little indication that the threat ota military battle over Saigon his ' dime and thing to weaken the strength - of'thatlFadii tion . Thus , the evacuation may noklt longer .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
