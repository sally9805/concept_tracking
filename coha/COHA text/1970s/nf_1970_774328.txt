txt  | places in which to keep them . Thus , some ladies keep a large closet , in which are placed the tubs , pails , dippers , soap-dishes , starch , bluing , clothesline , clothes-pins , and every other article used in washing ; and in the same or another place are kept every convenience for ironing . In the sewing department , a trunk , with suitable partitions , is provided , in which are placed , each in its proper place , white thread of all sizes , colored thread , yarns for mending , colored and black sewing-silks and twist , tapes and bobbins of all sizes , white and colored welting-cords , silk braids and cords , needles of all sizes , papers of pins , remnants of linen and colored cambric , a supply of all kinds of buttons used in the family , black and white hooks and eyes , a yard measure , and all the patterns used in cutting and fitting . These are done up in separate parcels and labelled . In another trunk , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that any article can be found without loss of time . A trunk like the first mentioned , will save many steps , and often much time and perplexity ; while purchasing thus by the quantity makes them come much cheaper than if bought in little portions as they are wanted . Such a trunk should be kept locked , and a smaller supply , for current use , be kept in a workbasket . The full supply of all conveniences in the kitchen and cellar , and a place appointed for each article , very much facilitates domestic labor . For want of this , much vexation and loss of time is occasioned , while seeking vessels in use , or in cleansing those used by different persons for various purposes . It would be far better for a lady to give up some expensive article in the parlor , and apply the money , thus saved , for kitchen conveniences , than to have a stinted supply where the most labor is to he performed . If our Countrywomen would devote more  | to comfort and convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great improvement . Mirrors and piertables in the parlor , and an unpainted , gloomy , , illfurnished kitchen , not unfrequently are found under the same roof . Another important item , in systematic economy , is the apportioning of regular employment to the various members of a family . If a housekeeper can secure the cooperation of all her family , she will find that " many hands make light work . " There is no greater mistake , than in bringing up children to feel that they must be taken care of , and waited on , by others , without any corresponding obligations on their part . The extent to which young children can be made useful in a family , would seem surprising to those who have never seen a systematic and regular plan for securing their services . The Writer has been in a family , where a little girl of eight or nine washed and dressed herself and little brother , and made their little beds before breakfast , set and cleared all the tables at meals , with a little help from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dusting of parlors and chambers was also neatly performed by her . A little brother of ten , brought in and piled all the wood used in the kitchen and parlor , brushed the boots and shoes neatly , went on errands , and took all the care of the poultry . They were children whose parents could afford to hire this service , but who chose to have their children grow up healthy and industrious , while proper instructions , system , and encouragement , made these services rather a pleasure than otherwise to the children . Some parents pay their children for such services ; but this is hazardous , as tending to make them feel that they are not bound to be helpful without pay , and also as tending to produce a hoarding , moneymaking spirit . Bat where children have no hoard-  | ing propensities , and need to acquire a sense of the value of property , it may be well to let them earn money for some extra services , rather as a favor . When this is done , they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for themselves ; and in this way , a generous and liberal spirit will be cultivated . There are some mothers , who take pains to teach their boys most of the domestic arts which their sisters learn . The Writer has seen boys mending their own garments , and aiding their mother or sisters in the kitchen , with great skill and adroitness ; and at an early age they usually very much relish joining in such occupations . The sons of such mothers , in their college life , or in roaming about the world , or in nursing a sick wife or infant , find occasion to bless the forethought and kindness which prepared there for such emergencies . Few things are in worse taste , than for a man needlessly to busy himself in women 's work ; and yet a man never appears in a more interesting attitude , than when , by skill in such matters , he can save a mother or wife from care and suffering . The more a boy is taught to use his hands in every variety of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and body , are developed ; for mechanical pursuits exercise the intellect , as well as the hands . The early training of New England boys , in which they turn their hand to almost every thing , is one great reason of the quick perceptions , versatility of mind , and mechanical skill , for which that portion of our Countrymen are distinguished . The Writer has known one mode of systematizing the aid of the older children in a family , which , in some cases of very large families , it may be well to imitate . In the case referred to , when the oldest daughter was eight or nine years old , an infant sister was given to her as her special charge . She  | tended it , made and mended its clothes , taught it to read , and was its nurse and guardian through all its childhood . Another infant was given to the next daughter , and thus the children were all paired in this interesting relation . In addition to the relief thus afforded to the mother , the elder children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both older and younger bound to each other by peculiar ties of tenderness and gratitude . In offering these examples of various modes of systematizing , one suggestion may be worthy of attention . It is not unfrequently the case , that ladies , who find themselves cumbered with oppressive cares , after reading remarks on the benefits of system , immediately commence the task of arranging their pursuits , with great vigor and hope . They divide the day into . regular periods , and give each hour its duty ; they systematize their work , and endeavor to bring every thing into a regular routine . But in a short time , they find themselves baffled , discouraged , and disheartened , and finally relapse into their former desultory ways , with a sort of resigned despair . The difficulty , in such cases , is , that they attempt too much at a time . There is nothing which so much depends upon habit , as a systematic mode of performing duty ; and where no such habit has been formed , it is impossible for a novice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which none but an adept could carry through . The only way for such persons , is , to begin with a little at a time . Let them select some three or four things , and resolutely attempt to conquer at these points . In time , a habit will be formed of doing a few things at regular periods , and in a systematic way . Then it will be easy to add a few more ; and thus , by a gradual process , the object can be secured , which it would be vain to attempt by a more summary course . Early rising is almost a sine qua non to  | success , in such an effort ; but where a woman lacks either the health or the energy to secure a period for devotional duties before breakfast , let her select that hour of the day in which she will be least liable to interruption , and let her then seek strength and wisdom from the only true Source . At this time , let her take a pen and make a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a calculation be made , whether there is time enough in the day or the week for all these duties . If there is not , let the least important be stricken from the list , as what are not duties and must be omitted . In doing this , let a woman remember , that , though " what we shall eat , and what we shall drink , and wherewithal we shall be clothed , " are matters requiring due attention , they are very apt to take a wrong relative importance , while social , intellectual , and moral , interests , receive too little regard . In this Country , eating , dressing , and household furniture and ornaments , take far too large a place in the estimate of relative importance ; and it is probable that most women could modify their views and practice , so as to come nearer to the Saviour 's requirements . No woman has a right to put a stitch of ornament on any article of dress or furniture , or to provide one superfluity in food , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , intellectual , benevolent , and religious , duties . If a woman will take the trouble to make such a calculation as this , she will usually find that she has time enough to perform all her duties easily and well . It is impossible for a conscientious woman to secure that peaceful mind , and cheerful enjoyment of life , which all should seek , who is constantly finding her duties jarring with each other , and much remaining undone , which she feels that she ought to do . In consequence of this , there will be a secret  | uneasiness , which will throw a shade over the whole current of life , never to be removed , till she so efficiently defines and regulates her duties , that she can fulfil them all . And here the Writer would urge upon young ladies the importance of forming habits of system , while unembarrassed with multiplied cares which will make the task so much more difficult and hopeless . Every young lady can systematize her pursuits , to a certain extent . She can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her trunks , closets , and drawers . She can keep her workbasket , her desk at school , and all her conveniences in proper places , and in regular order . She can have regular periods for reading , walking , visiting , study , and domestic pursuits . And by following this method , in youth , she will form a taste for regularity , and a habit of system , which will prove a blessing to her through life .  | ON GIVING IN CHARITY .

IT is probable that there is no point of duty , where conscientious persons differ more in opinion , or where they find it more difficult to form discriminating and decided views , than on the matter ofcharity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , money , and efforts , to relieve the destitute , all allow . But , as to how much we are to give , and on whom our charities shall be bestowed , many a reflecting mind has been at a loss . Yet it seems very desirable , that , in reference to a duty so constantly and so strenuously urged by the Supreme Ruler , we should be able so to fix metes and bounds , as to keep a conscience void of offence , and to free the mind from disquieting fears of deficiency .  | The Writer has found no other topic of investigation so beset with difficulty , so absolutely without the range of definite rules which can apply to all in all circumstances . But on this , as on a previous topic , there seem to be general principles , by the aid of which , any candid mind , sincerely desirous of obeying the commands of Christ however much self-denial may be involved , can arrive at definite conclusions as to its own individual obligations , so that , when these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mind that is worldly , living mainly to seek its own pleasures , instead of living to please God , no principles can be so fixed , as not to leave a ready escape from all obligation . Such minds , either by indolence ( and consequent ignorance ) or by sophistry , will convince themselves that a life of engrossing self-indulgence , with perhaps the gift of a few dollars and a few hours of time , may so suffice to fulfil the reouisitions of the Eternal Judge , that they can safely meet Him at the final day . For such minds , no reasonings will avail , till the heart is so changed , that , to learn the will and follow the example of Jesus Christ , becomes the leading object of interest and effort . It is to aid those who profess to possess this temper of mind , that the following suggestions are offered . The first consideration , which gives definiteness to this subject , is , a correct view of the object for which we are placed in this world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be acting on the supposition , that the object of life is to secure as much as possible of all the various enjoyments placed within reach . Not so teaches reason or revelation . From these , we learn , that , though the happiness of His creatures is the end for which God created and sustains them , yet that this happiness depends , not on the various modes of gratification 14  | put within our reach , but mainly on character . A man may possess all the resources for enjoyment which this world can afford , and yet feel that " all is vanity and vexation of spirit , " and that he is supremely wretched . Another may be in want of all things , and yet possess that living spring of benevolence , faith , and hope , which will make an Eden of the darkest prison . In order to be perfectly happy , man must attain that character , which Christ exhibited ; and the nearer he approaches it , the more will happiness reign in his breast . But what was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denying benevolence . He came " not to seek His own ; " He " went about doing good , " and this was His " meat and drink ; " that is , it was this that sustained the health and life of His mind , as food and drink sustain the health and life of the body . Now , the mind , of man is so made , that it can gradually be transformed into the same likeness . A selfish being , who for a whole life has been nourishing habits of indolent self-indulgence , can , by taking Christ as his example , by communion with Him , and by daily striving to imitate His character and conduct , form such a temper of mind , that " doing good " will become the chief and highest source of enjoyment . And this heavenly principle will grow stronger and stronger , until self-denial loses the more painful part of its character , and then , living to make happiness , will be so delightful and absorbing a pursuit , that all exertions , regarded as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of men when they strive for a prize or a crown with the full hope of success . In this view of the subject , efforts and self-denial for the good of others are to be regarded , not merely as duties enjoined for the benefit of others , but as the moral training indispensable to the formation of  | that character , on which depends our own happiness both for time and eternity . This view exhibits the full meaning of the Saviour 's declaration , " how hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of Heaven ! " He had before taught , that the kingdom of Heaven consisted not in such enjoyments as the worldly seek , but in the temper of self-denying benevolence like His own ; and , as the rich have far greater temptations to indolent selfindulgence , they are far less likely to ' acquire this temper , than those , who , by limited means , are inured to some degree of self-denial . But on this point , one important distinction needs to be made , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere self-mortification , and that which is exercised to secure greater good to ourselves and others . The first is the foundation of monasticism , penances , and all other forms of asceticism ; the latter , only , is that which Christianity requires . A second consideration , which may give definiteness to this subject , is , that the formation of a perfect character involves , not the extermination of any principles of our nature , but rather the regulating of them , according to the rules of reason and religion ; so that the lower propensities shall always be kept subordinate to nobler principles . Thus we are not to aim at destroying our appetites , or at needlessly denying them , but rather so to regulate them , that they shall best secure the objects for which they were implanted . We are not to annihilate the love of praise and admiration ; but so to control it , that the favor of God shall be regarded more than the estimation of men . We are not to extirpate the principle of curiosity , which leads us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all our acquisitions shall be useful and not frivolous or injurious . And thus with all the principles of the mind , God  | has implanted no desires in our constitution , which are evil and pernicious . On the contrary , all our constitutional propensities , either of mind or body , he designed we should gratify , whenever no evils would thence result , either to ourselves or others . Such principles as envy , ambition , pride , revenge , and hate , are to be exterminated ; for they are either excesses or excrescences : not created by God , but rather the result of our own neglect to form habits of benevolence and self-control . In deciding the rules of our conduct , therefore , we are ever to bear in mind , that the developement of the nobler principles , and the subjugation of inferior propensities to them , is to be the main object of effort , both for ourselves and for others . And in conformity with this , in all our plans , we are to place religious and moral interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , and our physical gratifications , as subordinate to all . A third consideration , is , that , though the means for sustaining life and health are to be regarded as necessaries , without which no other duties can be performed , yet that a very large portion of the time spent by most persons in easy circumstances , for food , raiment , and dwellings , are for mere svpeifnities , which are right when they do not involve the sacrifice of higher interests , and wrong when they do . Life and health can be sustained in the humblest dwellings , with the plainest dress , and the simplest food , and after taking from our means what is necessary for life and health , the remainder is to be so divided , that the larger portion shall be given to supply the moral and intellectual wants of ourselves and others , and the smaller share to procure those additional gratifications , of taste and appetite , not indispensable . Mankind , as yet , have never made this apportionment of their means ; but , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mere  | physical wants have been made subordinate to higher objects . Another very important consideration , is , that in urging the duty of charity , and the prior claims of moral and religious objects , no rule of duty should be maintained , that it would not be right and wise for all to follow . And we are to test the wisdom of any general rule , by inquiring what would be the result , if all mankind should practise according to it . In view of this , we are enabled to judge of the correctness of those who maintain , that , to be consistent , men who hold to the eternal destruction of all those of our race who are not brought under the influence of the Christian system , should give up , not merely the elegances , but all the superfluities , of life , and devote the whole of their means , not indispensable to life and health , for the propagation of Christianity . But , if this is the duty of any , it is the duty of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , if all conscientious persons gave up the use of all superfluities . Suppose that two millions of the people in the United States were conscientious persons , and relinquished the use of every thing not absolutely necessary to life and health . It would instantly throw out of employment one half of the whole community . The manufacturers , mechanics , merchants , agriculturists , and all the agencies they employ , would be beggared , and one half of the community not reduced to poverty , would be obliged to spend all their extra means in simply supplying necessaries to the other half . The use of superfluities , therefore , to a certain extent , is as indispensable to promote industry , virtue , and religion , as any direct giving of money or time : and it is owing entirely to a want of reflection , and of comprehensive views , that any men ever . make so great a mistake , as is here exhibited . Instead , then , of urging a rule of duty which is 14*  | at once irrational and impracticable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the understandings of all . For whatever may be the practice of intelligent men , they universally concede the principle , that our physical gratifications should always be made subordinate to social , intellectual , and moral advantages . And all that is required , for the advancement of our whole race to the most perfect state of society , is , simply , that men should act in agreement with this principle . And if only a very small portion of the most intelligent of our race should act according to this rule , under the control of Christian benevolence , the immense supplies , that would be furnished for the general good , is far beyond what any would imagine , who had never made any calculations on the subject . In this Nation , alone , suppose the one million and more of professed followers of Christ should give a larger portion of their means for the social , intellectual , and moral , wants of mankind , than for the superfluities that minister to taste , convenience , and appetite ; it would be enough to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and missionaries , that the whole world could demand ; or at least , it would be far more than properly qualified agents to administer it could employ . But it may be objected , that , though this view is one , which , in the abstract , looks plausible and rational , not one in a thousand can practically adopt it . How few keep any account at all of their current expenses ? How impossible it is to determine exactly what are necessaries , and what are superfluities ! And in regard to women , how few have the control of an income , so as not to be bound by the wishes of a parent or a husband ! In reference to these difficulties , the first remark is , that we are never under obligations to do what is entirely out of our power , so that those persons who  | have no power to regulate their expenses or their charities , are under no sort of obligation to attempt it . The second remark is , that when a rule of duty is discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , just so far as we can . The third remark is , that no person can tell how much can be done , till a faithful attempt has been made . If a woman never did keep any accounts , nor attempt to regulate her expenditures by the right rule , nor use her influence with those that control her plans , to secure this object , she has no right to say how much she can , or can not , do , till after a fair trial has been made . In attempting such a trial , the following method can be taken . Let a woman keep an account of all she spends for herself and her family , for a year , arranging the items under three general heads . Under the first , put all articles for food , raiment , rent , wages , and all conveniences . Under the second , place all sums paid in securing an education and books and all intellectual advantages . Under the third head , place all that is spent for benevolence and religion . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account will show the mixed items of necessaries and superfluities , which can be arranged so as to gain some sort of idea how much has been spent for superfluities , and how much for necessaries . Then , by comparing what is spent for superfluities with what is spent for intellectual and moral advantages , data will he gained for judging of the past , and regulating the future . Does a woman say she can not do this ? let her inquire , whether the offer of a thousand dollars , as a reward for attempting it one year , would not make her undertake to do it ; and if so , let her decide , in her own mind , which is most valuable , a clear conscience , and the approbation of God , in this effort to do His will , or one thousand dollars . And let her do it with this warning of the Saviour before her  | eyes , ? " No man can serve two masters . " " Ye can not serve God and Mammon . " Is it objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list ? it is replied , we are not required to judge exactly , in all cases . Our duty is , to use the means in our power to aid us in forming a correct judgement ; to seek the Divine aid in freeing our minds from indolence and selfishness ; and then to judge as well as we can , in our endeavors rightly to apportion and regulate our expenses . Many persons seem to feel that they are bound to do better than they know how . But God is not so hard a Master ; and after we have used all proper means to learn the right way , if we then follow it according to our ability , we do wrong to feel misgivings , or to blame ourselves , if results come out differently from what seems desirable . The results of our actions , alone , can never prove that we deserve blame . For it is often the case , that , by lack of intellect or means , men are so placed , that it is impossible for them to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reach , and then to judge with a candid and conscientious spirit , is all that God requires ; and when we have done this , and the event seems to come out wrong , we should never wish that we had decided otherwise . For it is the same as wishing that we had not followed the dictates of judgement and conscience . As this is a world designed for discipline and trial , untoward events are never to be construed as indications of the rectitude of our past decisions . In order to act in accordance with the rule here presented , it is true , that many would be obliged to give up the idea of conforming to the notions and customs of those with whom they associate , and compelled to adopt the maxim , " be not conformed to this world . " In many cases , it would involve an entire change in the style of living . And the Writer  | has the happiness of knowing more cases than one , where men , who have come to similar views on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their carriages , dismissed a portion of their domestics , and modified all their expenditures , that they might keep a pure conscience , and regulate their charities more according to the requirements of Christianity . And there are persons , well known in the religious world , who save themselves all labor of minute calculation , by giving so large a portion of their means to benevolent objects , that they find no difficulty in knowing that they give more for religious , benevolent , and intellectual , than for any inferior objects . In deciding what particular objects shall receive our benefactions , there are also general principles to guide us . The first , is that presented by our Saviour , when , after urging the great law of benevolence , He was asked , " and who is my neighbor ? " His reply , in the parable of the Good Samaritan , teaches us , that any human being , whose wants are brought to our knowledge , is our neighbor . The wounded man was not only a stranger , but he belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , except that his wants were brought to the knowledge of the wayfaring man . From this , we learn that the destitute , of all nations , become our neighbors , as soon as their wants are brought to our knowledge . Another general principle , is this , that those who are most in need , must be relieved , in preference to those who are less destitute . On this principle , it is , that the followers of Christ should give more to supply those who are suffering for want of the bread of eternal life , than for those who are deprived of physical enjoyments . And another reason for this preference , is , the fact that many , who give in charity , have made such imperfect advances in civilization  | and Christianity , that the intellectual and moral wants of our race make but a feeble impression on the mind . Relate a pitiful tale of a family reduced to live for weeks on potatoes , only , and many a mind would awake to deep sympathy , and stretch forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is pining in stupidity and ignorance , or racked with the fever of baleful passions , and how small the number so elevated in sentiment , and so enlarged in their views , as to appreciate and sympathize in these far greater misfortunes ! The intellectual and moral wants of our fellow-men , therefore , should claim the first place in our attention , both because they are most important , and because they are most neglected . Another consideration to he borne in mind , is , that , in this Country , there is much less real need of charity in supplying physical necessities , than is generally supposed by those who have not learned the more excellent way . This Land is so abundant in supplies , and labor is in such demand , that every healthy person can earn a comfortable support . And if all the poor were instantly made virtuous , it is probable that there would be no physical wants which could not readily be supplied by the immediate friends of each sufferer . The sick , the aged , and the orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view of the case , the primary effort in relieving the poor should be , to furnish them the means of earning their own support , and to supply them with those moral influences which are most effectual in securing virtue and industry . Another point to be attended to , is , the importance of maintaining a system of associated charities . There is no point , in which the economy of charity has more improved , than in the present mode of combining many small contributions for sustaining enlarged and systematic plans of charity . If all the  | half-dollars , which are now contributed to aid in organized systems of charity , were returned to the donors , to be applied by the agency and discretion of each , thousands and thousands of the treasures , now employed to promote the moral and intellectual wants of mankind , would become entirely useless . In a democracy , like ours , where few are very rich , and the majority are in comfortable circumstances , this collecting and dispensing of drops and rills is the mode by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to distil on parched and desert lands . And every person , while earning a pittance to unite with many more , may be cheered with the consciousness of sustaining a grand system of operations , which must have the rnost decided influence in raising all mankind to that perfect state of society , which Christianity is designed to secure . Another consideration relates to the indiscriminate bestowal of charity . Persons who have taken pains to inform themselves , and who devote their whole time to dispensing charities , unite in declaring , that this is one of the most fruitful sources of indolence , vice , and poverty . From several of these , the Writer has learned , that , by their own personal investigations , they have ascertained , that there are large establishments of idle and wicked persons in most of our cities , who associate together to support themselves by every species of imposition . They hire large houses , and live in constant rioting on the means thus obtained . Among them , are women who have , or who hire the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maimed , or deformed , or who can adroitly feign such infirmities , and by these means of exciting pity , and by artful tales of wo , they collect alms , both in city and country , to spend in all manner of gross and guilty indulgences . Meantime , many persons , finding themselves often duped by impostors , refuse to give at all ; and thus  | many benefactions are withdrawn , which a wise economy in charity would have secured . For this , and other reasons , it is wise and merciful , to adopt the general rule , never to give alms , till some knowledge is gained , of knowing how they will be spent . There are exceptions to this , as to every general rule , which a person of discretion can determine . But the practice , so common among benevolent persons , of giving at least a trifle to all who ask , lest , perchance , they may turn away some who are really sufferers , is one which causes more sin and misery than it cures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity , so successful , as the one which , in many places , has been adopted in connection with the distribution of tracts . By this method , a town or city is divided into districts ; and each district is committed to the care of two ladies , whose duty it is to call on each family and leave a tract , and make that the occasion for entering into conversation , and learning the situation of all residents in the district . By this method , the ignorant , the vicious , and the poor , are discovered , and their physical , intellectual , and moral , wants , are investigated . In some places , where the Writer has resided or visited , each lady retained the same district , year after year , so that every poor family in the place was under the watch and care of some intelligent and benevolent lady , who used all her influence to secure a proper education for the children , to furnish them with suitable reading , to encourage habits of industry and economy , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich and the poor were brought in contact , in a way advantageous to both parties ; and if such a system could be universally adopted , more would be done for the prevention of poverty and vice , than all the wealth of the Nation could avail for their relief . In one of these places ,  | the Writer heard a resident reply to some remarks about the danger of having her fruit stolen , " No ; the boys never steal fruit here . The people never take any pains to protect it , and have it in great abundance ; but it is seldom if ever taken without leave . " This was in a city of twenty thousand inhabitants , where the plan above described had been in efficient operation for several years . But this plan can not be successfully carried out , in this manner , unless there is a large proportion of intelligent , benevolent , and self-denying , persons ; and the mere distribution of tracts , without the other parts of the plan , is of very little avail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especial consideration . It is that , which leads a person to refrain from judging of the means and the relative charities of other persons . There have been such indistinct notions , and so many different standards of duty , on this subject , that it is rare for two persons to think exactly alike , in regard to the measure of duty . Each person is bound to inquire and judge for himself , as to his own duty or deficiencies ; but as both the resources , and the amount of actual charities of other men are beyond our ken , it is as indecorous , as it is uncharitable , to set in judgement on their decisions . 15  | ON ECONOMY OF TIME AND EXPENSES .

THE value of time , and our obligation to spend every hour for some useful end , are what few minds properly realize . And those , who have the highest sense of their obligations in this respect , sometimes greatly misjudge in their estimate of what are useful and proper modes of employing time . This arises from limited views of the importance of some pur-  | suits , which they would deem frivolous and useless , but which are , in reality , necessary to preserve the health of body and mind , and those social affections , which it is very important to cherish . Christianity teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must give account to God ; and that we have no right to waste a single hour . But time which is spent in rest or amusement , is often as usefully employed , as if it were devoted to labor or devotion . In employing our time , we are to make suitable allowance for sleep , for preparing and taking food , for securing the means of a livelihood , for intellectual improvement , for exercise and amusement , for social enjoyments , and for benevolent and religious duties . And it is the right apportionment of time to these various duties , which constitutes its true economy . In making this apportionment , we are bound by the same rules as relate to the use of property . We are to employ whatever portion is necessary to sustain life and health , as the first duty ; and the remainder we are so to apportion , that our highest interests shall receive the greatest allotment , and our physical gratifications the least . The laws of the Supreme Ruler , when He became the civil as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example which it would be well for all attentively to consider , when forming plans for the apportionment of time and property . To estimate this properly , it must be borne in mind , that the main object of God was to preserve His religion among the Jewish nation , and that they were not required to take any means to propagate it among other nations , as is now required by Christianity . So low were they in the scale of civilization and mental development , that a system , which confined them to one spot , as an agricultural people , and prevented their growing very rich , or having extensive commerce with other nations , was indis-  | pensable to prevent their relapsing into the low idolatries and vices of the nations around them . The proportion of time and property , which every Jew was required to devote to intellectual , benevolent , and religious purposes , were as follows . In regard to property , they were required to give one tenth of all their yearly income , to support the Levites and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the first fruits of all their corn , wine , oil , and fruits , and the first-born of all their cattle , for the Lord 's treasury , to be employed for the priests , the widow , the fatherless , and the stranger . The first-born , also , of their children , were the Lord 's , and were to be redeemed by a specified sum , paid into the sacred treasury . Besides this , they were required to bring a freewill offering to God , every time they went up to the three great yearly festivals . In addition to this , regular yearly sacrifices , of cattle and fowls , were required of each family , and occasional sacrifices for certain sins or ceremonial impurities . In reaping their fields , they were required to leave the corners for the poor , unreaped , and not to glean their fields , or olive and vineyards ; and if a sheaf was left , by mistake , they were not to return for it , but leave it for the poor . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress . " When a poor man came to borrow money , they were forbidden to deny him , or to take any interest ; and if , at the sabbatical , or seventh , year , he could not pay , the debt was to be cancelled . And to this command , is added the significant caution , " Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart , saying , the seventh year , the year of release , is at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest him nought ; and he cry unto the Lord against thee , and it be sin  | unto thee . Thou shalt surely give him , " " because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto . " Besides this , the Levites were distributed through the land , with the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . Thus , one twelfth of the people were set apart , having no landed property , to be priests and teachers ; and the other tribes were required to support them liberally . In regard to the time taken from secular pursuits , for the support of religion , an equally liberal amount was demanded . In the first place , one seventh part of their time was taken for the weekly sabbath , when no kind of work was to be done . Then the whole nation were required to meet at the appointed place , three times a year , which , including their journeys , and stay there , occupied eight weeks , which was another seventh of their time . Then the sabbatical year , when no agricultural labor was to be done , took another seventh of their time from their regular pursuits , as they were an agricultural people . This was the amount of time and property demanded by God , simply to sustain religion and morality within the bounds of that nation . Christianity demands the spread of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Jews are withheld , and all our wealth and time , not needful for our own best interest , is to be employed in improving the condition of our fellow-men . In deciding respecting the rectitude of our pursuits , we are bound to aim at some practical good , as the ultimate object . With every duty of this life , our benevolent Creator has connected some species of enjoyment , to draw us to perform it . Thus the palate is gratified , by performing the duty of nourishing our bodies ; the principle of curiosity is gratified , in pursuing useful knowledge ; the desire of approbation 15*  | is gratified , when we perform benevolent and social duties ; and every other duty has an alluring enjoyment connected with it . But the great mistake of mankind has consisted in seeking the pleasures , connected with these duties , as the sole aim , without reference to the main end that should be held in view , and to which the enjoyment should be made subservient . Thus , men seek to gratify the palate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly nourished ; and follow after knowledge , without inquiring whether it ministers to good or evil . But , in gratifying the implanted desires of our nature , we are bound so to restrain ourselves , by reason and conscience , as always to seek the main objects of existence , ? the highest good of ourselves and others ; and never to sacrifice this , for the mere gratification of our sensual desires . We are to gratify appetite , just so far as is consistent with health and usefulness , and no further . We are to gratify the desire for knowledge , just so far as will enable us to do most good by our influence and efforts ; and no further . We are to seek social intercourse , to that extent , which will best promote domestic enjoyment and kindly feelings among neighbors and friends . And we are to pursue exercise and amusement , only so far as will best sustain the vigor of body and mind . And for the right apportionment of time , to these and various other duties , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of attempting to give any very specific rules on this subject , some modes of economizing time will be suggested . The most powerful of all agencies , in this matter , is , that habit of system and order , in all our pursuits , which has been already pointed out . It is probable , that a person , who is regular and systematic in employing time , will accomplish thrice the amount , that could otherwise be secured . Another mode of economizing time , is , by uniting  | several objects in one employment . Thus , exercise , or charitable efforts , can be united with social enjoyments , as is done in associations for sewing or visiting the poor . Instruction and amusement can also be combined . Pursuits like music , gardening , drawing , botany , and the like , unite intellectual improvement with amusement , social enjoyment , and exercise . With housekeepers , and others whose employments are various and desultory , much time can he saved by preparing employments for little odd intervals . Thus , some ladies prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up when detained there ; some keep a book at hand , in the nursery , to read while holding or sitting by a sleeping infant . One of the most popular poetesses of our Country very often shows her friends , at their calls , that the thread of the knitting never need interfere with the thread of agreeable discourse . It would be astonishing , to one who had never tried the experiment , how much can be accomplished , by a little planning and forethought , in thus finding employment for odd intervals of time . But besides economizing our own time , we are bound to use our influence and example to promote the discharge of the same duty by others . A woman is under obligations so to arrange the hours and pursuits of her family , as to promote systematic and habitual industry ; and if , by late breakfasts , irregular hours for meals , and other hinderances of this kind , she interferes with , or refrains from promoting regular industry in , others , she is accountable to God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mere example of a systematic and industrious housekeeper , has a wonderful influence in promoting the same virtuous habit in others . ON ECONOMY LN EXPENSES . It is impossible for a woman to practise a wise economy in expenditures , unless she is taught how  | to do it , either by a course of experiments , or by the instruction of those who have had experience . It is amusing to notice the various , and oftentimes contradictory , notions of economy , among judicious and experienced housekeepers ; for there is probably no economist , who would not be deemed lavish or wasteful , in some respects , by another equally experienced and judicious person , who , in some other points , would herself be equally condemned by the other . These diversities are occasioned by different early habits , and by the different relative value given by each to the different modes of enjoyment , for which money is expended. * But , though there may be much disagreement in minor matters , there are certain general principles , which all unite in sanctioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the amount of income and of current expenses , so that the proper relative proportion be preserved , and the expenditures never exceed the means . Few women can do this , thoroughly , without keeping regular accounts . The habits of this Nation , especially among business-men , are so desultory , and the current expenses of a family , in many points , are so much more under the control of the man than of the woman , that many women , who are disposed to be systematic in this matter , can not follow their wishes . But there are often cases , when much is left undone in this particular , * The Writer , not long since , met an amusing illustration of this . " Anna , " said a wealthy lady , to her daughter , who had returned from an expensive boarding school , and was playing on the piano , " where is the fine needle ? " " I have broken it , " was the reply . " Where is the coarse one , then ? " " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and ask Mrs. C. to lend me her fine needle . " The daughter went , and returned , saying , " Mrs. C. says she has lost hers , and has not had time to get another . " A visiter , present , sent off for her wellstocked workbasket ; . and the remarks afterwards made , by the lady , in regard to its supplies , showed that she deemed her visiter lavish and extravagant in this matter . The wealthy lady hired out most of her plain sewing , and all her tailoring and mantuamaking . The visiter cut and made all the garments for her family , and each thought the other uneconomical .  | simply because no effort is made . Yet every woman is bound to do as much as is in her power , to accomplish a systematic mode of expenditure , and the regulation of it by Christian principles . The following are examples of different methods which have been adopted , for securing a proper adjustment of expenses to the means . The first , is that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our cities . Every evening , before retiring , she made an account of the expenses of the day ; and this usually occupied her not more than fifteen minutes , - at a time . On each Saturday , she took an inventory of the stores on hand , and of the daily expenses , and also of what was due to her ; and then made an exact estimate of her expenditures and profits . This , after the first two or three weeks , never took more than an hour , at the close of the week . Thus , by a very little time , regularly devoted to this object , she knew , accurately , her income , expenditures , and profits . Another friend of the Writer lives on a regular salary . The method adopted , in this case , is to calculate to what the salary amounts , each week . Then an account is Inapt of what is paid out , each week , for rent , fuel , wages , and food . This amount of each week is deducted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , at the close of a month , as the stock from which is to be taken , the dress , furniture , books , travelling expenses , charities , and all other expenditures . Another lady , whose husband is a lawyer , divides the year into four quarters , and the income into four equal parts . She then makes her plans , so that the expenses of one quarter shall never infringe on the income of another . So resolute is she , in carrying out this determination , that if , by any mischance , she is in want of articles before the close of a quarter , for which she has not the means , she will subject  | herself to temporary inconvenience , by waiting , rather than violate her rule . Another lady , whose husband is in a business , which he thinks makes it impossible for him to know what his yearly income will be , took this method . She kept an account of all her disbursements , for one year . This she submitted to her husband , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her control , the coming year , for similar purposes , with the understanding that she might modify future apportionments , in any way her judgement and conscience might approve . A great deal of uneasiness and discomfort is caused to both husband and wife , in many cases , by an entire want of system and forethought , in arranging expenses . Both keep buying what they think they need , without any calculation as to how matters are coming out , and with a sort of dread of running in debt , all the time harassing them . Such never know the comfort of independence . But , if a man or woman will only calculate what the income is , and then plan so as to know that all the time they live within it , they secure one of the greatest comforts , which wealth ever bestows , and what many of the rich , who live in a loose and careless way , never enjoy . It is not so much the amount of income , as the regular and correct apportionment of expenses , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand a year , is often more harassed , for want of money , than the systematic economist , who supports a family on only six hundred a year . As it is very important that young ladies should learn systematic economy in expenses , it will be a great benefit for every young girl to begin , at twelve or thirteen , to make her own purchases , under the guidance of her mother or some other friend . And if parents would ascertain the actual expense of a daughter 's clothing , for a year , and give the sum  | to her , in quarterly payments , requiring a regular account , it would be of great benefit in preparing her for future duties . How else are young ladies to learn properly to make purchases , and to be systematic and economical ? The art of system and economy can no more come by intuition , than the art of watchmaking or bookkeeping ; and how strange it appears , that so many young ladies take charge of a husband 's establishment , without having had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station ! The second general principle of economy , is , that , in apportioning an income , among various objects , the most important should receive the largest supply , and that all retrenchments be made in matters of less importance . In a previous chapter , some general principles have been presented , to guide in this duty . Some additional hints will here be added , on the same topic . In regard to dress and furniture , much want of judgement and good taste is often seen , in purchasing some expensive article , which is not at all in keeping with the other articles connected with it . Thus , a large sideboard , or elegant mirror , or sofa , which would be suitable only for a large establishment , with other rich furniture , is crowded into too small a room , with coarse and cheap articles around it . So , also , sometimes a parlor , and companychamber , will be furnished in a style suitable only for the wealthy , while the table will be supplied with shabby linen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look , in comparison with these fine rooms , mean and niggardly . It is not at all uncommon , to find very showy and expensive articles in the part of the house visible to strangers , when the children 's rooms , kitchen , and other back portions , are on an entirely different scale .  | So in regard to dress , a lady will sometimes purchase an elegant and expensive article , which , instead of attracting admiration from the eye of taste , will merely serve as a decoy to the painful contrast of all other parts of the dress . A woman of real good taste and discretion , will strive to maintain a relative consistency between all departments , and not , in one quarter , live on a scale fitted only to the rich , and in another , on one appropriate only to the poor . Another mistake in economy is often made , by some of the best-educated and most intelligent of mothers . Such will often be found spending day after day at the needle , when , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who need such earnings . Meantime , the daughters of the family , whom the mother is qualified to educate , or so nearly , that she could readily keep ahead of her children , are sent to expensive boarding-schools , where their delicate frames , their plastic minds , and their moral and religious interests , are relinquished to the hands of strangers . And the expense , thus incurred , would serve to pay the hire of every thing the mother can do in sewing , four or five times over . The same want of economy is shown in communities , where , instead of establishing a good female school in their vicinity , the men of wealth send their daughters abroad , at double the expense , to be either educated or spoiled , as the case may be . Another species of poor economy , is manifested in neglecting to acquire and apply mechanical skill , which , in consequence , has to be hired from others . Thus , all the plain sewing will be done by the mother and daughters , while all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others take pains to have their daughters instructed in mantuamaking , and the simpler parts of millinery , so that the plain work is given to the poor , who need it , and the more  | expensive and tasteful operations are performed in the family . The Writer knows ladies , who not only make their own dresses , but also their caps , bonnets , and artificial flowers . Some persons make miscalculations in economy , by habitually looking up cheap articles , while others go to the opposite extreme , and always buy the best of every thing . Those ladies , who are considered the best economists , do not adopt either method . In regard to cheap goods , the fading colors , the damages discovered in use , the poorness of material , and the extra sewing demanded to replace articles lost by such causes , usually render such bargains very dear , in the end . On the other hand , though some articles , of the most expensive kind , wear longest and best , yet , as a general rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true of table and bed linens , broadcloths , shirtings , and the like ; though , in these cases , it is often found that the coarsest and cheapest last the longest . Buying by wholesale , and keeping a large supply on hand , is economical only in large families , where ' the mistress is careful ; but in other cases , the hazards of accident , and the temptation to a lavish use . will make the loss outrun the profits . There is one mode of economizing , which , it is hoped , will every year grow more rare ; and that is , making penurious savings by getting the poor to work as cheap as possible . Many amiable and benevolent women have done this , on principle , without reflecting on the want of Christian charity thus displayed . Let every woman , in making bargains with the poor , conceive herself placed in the same circumstances , toiling hour after hour , and day after day , for a small sum , and then deal with others as she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prompt payment , should be an unfailing maxim in dealing with the poor . 16  | The third general principle of economy , is , that all articles should be so used , and taken care of , as to secure the longest service with the least waste . Under this head , come many particulars in regard to the use and preservation of articles , which will be found more in detail in succeeding chapters . It may be proper , however , here to refer to one very common impression , as to the relative obligation of the poor and the rich in regard to economy . Many seem to suppose , that those who are wealthy , have a right to be lavish and negligent in the care of expenses . But this surely is a great mistake . Property is a talent , given by God , to spend for the welfare of mankind ; and the needless waste of it , is as wrong in the rich , as it is in the poor . The rich are under obligations to apportion their income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule as all others ; and if this will allow them to spend more for superfluities than those of smaller means , it never makes it right to misuse or waste any of the bounties of Providence . Whatever is no longer wanted for their own enjoyment , should be carefully saved , to add to the enjoyment of others . It is not always that men understand the economy of Providence , in that unequal distribution of property , which , even under the most perfect form of government , will always exist . Many , looking at the present state of things , imagine that the rich , if they acted in strict conformity to the law of benevolence , would share all their property with their suffering fellow-men . But such do not take into account the inspired declaration , that a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of that which he possesseth , or , in other words , life is made valuable , not by great possessions , but by such a character as prepares a man to enjoy what he holds . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of discipline which exists , when there  | is something valuable to be gained by industrious efforts . This stimulus to industry , never could exist in a community where all are just alike , as it does in a state of society where every man sees enjoyments possessed by others , which he desires and may secure by effort arid industry . So in a community where all are alike as to property , there would be no chance to gain that noblest of all attainments , a habit of self-denying benevolence , which toils for the good of others , and takes from one 's own store to increase the enjoyments of another . Instead , then , of the stagnation both of industry and of benevolence , which would follow the universal and equable distribution of property , one class of men , by superior advantages of birth , or intellect , or patronage , come into possession of a great amount of capital . With these means , they are enabled , by study , reading , and travel , to secure expansion of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual , and physical enjoyments . At the same time , Christianity imposes obligations corresponding with the increase of advantages and means . The rich are not at liberty to spend their treasures for themselves , alone . Their wealth is given , by God , to be employed for the best good of mankind ; and their intellectual advantages are designed , primarily , to enable them to judge correctly , in employing their means most wisely for the general good . Now , suppose a man of wealth inherits ten thousand acres of real estate : it is not his duty to divide it among his poor neighbors and tenants . It is probable , that , if he took this course , most of them would spend all in thriftless waste and indolence , or in mere physical enjoyments . Instead of thus putting his capital out of his hands , he is bound to retain it , and so employ it. , as to raise his neighbors and tenants to such a state of virtue and intelligence ,  | that they could secure far more , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dividing his capital . In this view of the subject , it is manifest , that the unequal distribution of property is no evil . The great difficulty is , that so large a portion of those who hold great capital , instead of using their various advantages for the common good , employ the chief of them for mere selfish indulgences ; thus inflicting as much mischief on their own souls , as results to others from their culpable neglect . A great portion of the rich seem to be acting on the principle , that the more God bestows on them , the less are their obligations to practise any self-denial , in fulfilling his benevolent plan of raising our race to intelligence and holiness . There are not a few , who seem to imagine that it is a mark of gentility to be careless of expenses . But this notion is owing to a want of knowledge of the world . As a general fact , it will be found , that persons of rank , and wealth , abroad , are much more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these respects . Even the most frivolous , among the rich and great , are often found practising a rigid economy , in certain respects , in order to secure gratifications in another direction . And it will be found so common , among persons of vulgar minds and little education and less sense , to make a display of profusion and indifference to expense , as a mark of their claims to gentility , that the really genteel look upon it rather as a mark of low breeding . So that the sort of feeling which some persons cherish , as if it were mean to he careful of small sums , and to be attentive to relative prices , in making purchases , is founded on mistaken notions of gentility and propriety . But one caution is needful , in regard to another extreme . When a lady of wealth is seen roaming  | about in search of cheaper articles , or trying to beat down a shopkeeper , or making a close bargain with those she employs , the impropriety is glaring " to all minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in looking for extra cheap articles ; her time could be more profitably employed in distributing to the wants of others . And the practice of beating down tradespeople , is vulgar and degrading , in any one . A woman , after a little inquiry , can ascertain what is the fair and common price of things ; and if she is charged an exorbitant sum , she can decline taking the article . If the price be a fair one , it is inappropriate to search for another article which is below the regular charge . If a woman finds that she is in a store where they charge high prices , expecting to be beat down , she can simply mention , that she wishes to know the lowest price , as it is contrary to her principles to beat down charges . There is one inconsistency , found among that class who are ambitious of being ranked among the aristocracy of society , which is worthy of notice . It has been remarked , that , in the real aristocracy of other lands , it is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And such do not hesitate to say so , when they can not afford certain indulgences . This practice descends to subordinate grades ; so that foreign ladies , when they come to reside in this Country , seldom hesitate in assigning the true reason , when they can not afford any gratification . But in this Country , it will be found , that many , most fond of copying aristocratic examples , are on this point rather with the vulgar . Not a few of those young persons , beginning life with parlors and dresses in a style fitting only to established wealth , go into expenses which they can ill afford , and are ashamed even to allow that they are restrained from any expense by motives of economy . Such a con-16  | fession is never extorted , except by some call of benevolence , and then they are very ready to declare that they can not afford to bestow even a pittance . In such cases , it would seem as if the direct opposite of Christianity had gained possession of their tastes and opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very far from any shame in denying the calls of benevolence .

Some Pupils always needing Restraint in regard to Study , A Third Cause of Mental Disease , the Want of Appropriate Exercise of the Various Faculties of the Mind . Extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Results of active Intellectual Employments . Indications of a Diseased Mind . THERE is such an intimate connection between the body and mind , that the health of one can not be preserved , without a proper care of the other . And it is from a neglect of this principle , that some of the most exemplary and conscientious persons in the world , suffer a thousand agonies , from a diseased state of body , white others ruin the health of the body , by neglecting the proper care of the mind . When the brain is excited , by stimulating drinks  | taken into the stomach , it produces a corresponding excitement of the mental faculties . The reason , the imagination , and all the powers , are stimulated to preternatural vigor and activity . In like manner , when the mind is excited by earnest intellectual effort , or by strong passions , the brain is equally excited , and the blood rushes into the head . Sir Astley Cooper records , that , in examining the brain of a young man who had lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by some opposition to his wishes , " " the blood was sent , with increased force , to his brain , " and the pulsations " became frequent and violent . " The same effect was produced by any intellectual effort ; and the flushed countenance which attends earnest study , or strong emotions of fear , shame , ' or anger , are external indications of the suffused state of the brain from such causes . In exhibiting the causes which injure the health of the mind , they will be found to be partly physical , partly intellectual , and partly moral . The first cause of mental disease and suffering , is not unfrequently found in the want of a proper supply of duly oxygenized blood . It has been shown , how the blood , in passing through the lungs , is purified , by the oxygen of the air combining with the superabundant hydrogen and carbon of the venous blood , thus forming carbonic acid and water , which are expired into the atmosphere . Every pair of lungs is constantly withdrawing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . When , by confinement , and this process , the atmosphere is deprived of its appropriate supply of oxygen , the purification of the blood is interrupted , and it passes unprepared into the brain , producing languor , restlessness , and inability to exercise the intellect and feelings . Whenever , therefore , per-  | sons sleep in a close apartment , or remain for a length of time in a crowded ill-ventilated room , a most pernicious influence is exerted on the brain , and , through this on the mind . A person often exposed to such influences , can never enjoy that elasticity and vigor of mind , which is one of the chief indications of its health . This is the reason why all rooms for religious meetings , and all schoolrooms , and sleeping apartments , should be so contrived , as to secure a constant supply of fresh air from without . The minister , who speaks in a crowded and ill-ventilated apartment , loses much of his ability to feel and to speak , while the audience are equally reduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , who confines children in a close apartment , diminishes their ability to study , or to attend to his instructions . And the person who habitually sleeps in a close room , diminishes his mental energies in a similar degree . It is not unfrequently the case , that depression of spirits , and stupor of intellect , are occasioned solely by this neglect . Another cause of mental disease , is , the excessive exercise of the intellect or feelings . If the eye is taxed beyond its strength , by protracted use , its blood-vessels become engorged , and the bloodshot appearance warns of the excess and the need of rest . The brain is affected , in a similar manner , by excessive use , though the suffering and inflamed organ can not make its appeal to the eye . But there are some indications , which ought never to be misunderstood or disregarded . In cases of pupils , at school or at college , a diseased state , from over action , is often manifested by increased clearness of mind , and ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Writer , a most exemplary and industrious pupil , anxious to improve every hour , and ignorant or unmindful of the laws of  | health , first manifested the diseased state of her brain and mind , by demands for more studies , and a sudden and earnest activity in planning modes of improvement for herself and others . When warned of her danger , she protested that she never was better , in her life ; that she took regular exercise in the open air , went to bed in season , slept soundly , and felt perfectly well ; that her mind was never before so bright and clear , and study never so easy and delightful . And at this time , she was on the verge of derangement , from which she was saved only by an entire cessation of all her intellectual efforts . A similar case occurred , under the eye of the Writer , from over-excited feelings . It was during a time of unusual religious interest in the community , and the danger was first manifested by the pupil bringing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her constant resort in every interval of school duty . It finally became impossible to convince her that it was her duty to attend to any thing else ; her conscience became morbidly sensitive , her perceptions indistinct , her deductions unreasonable , and nothing but entire change of scene , exercise , and amusement , saved her . When the health of the brain was restored , she found that she could attend to the " one thing needful , " not only without interruption of duty , or injury of health , but rather so as to promote both . This is a danger , which clergymen and teachers need most carefully to notice and guard against . Any such attention to religion , as prevents the performance of daily duties and needful relaxation , is dangerous , as tending to produce such a state of the brain as makes it impossible to feel or judge correctly . And when any morbid and unreasonable pertinacity appears , much exercise and engagement in other interesting pursuits should be urged , as the only mode of securing the religious benefits aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , anxiety , or sorrow , the amount of active exercise in the fresh air should be greatly increased , that the action of the muscles may withdraw the blood , which , in such seasons , is constantly tending too much to the brain . There has been a most appalling amount of suffering , derangement , disease , and death , occasioned by a want of attention to this subject , in teachers and parents . Unusual precocity in children , is usually the result of an unhealthful state of the brain ; and in such cases , medical men would now direct , that the wonderful child should be deprived of all books and study , and turned to play or work in the fresh air . Instead of this , parents frequently add fuel to the fever of the brain , by supplying constant mental stimulus , until the victim finds refuge in idiocy or an early grave . Where such fatal results do not occur , the brain , in many cases , is so weakened , that the genius of infancy sinks below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , many of the most promising minds sink to an early grave , or drag out a miserable existence , from this same cause . And it is an evil , as yet little alleviated by the increase of physiological knowledge . Every college and professional school , and every seminary for young ladies , needs a medical man , not only to lecture on physiology and the laws of health , but empowered , in his official capacity , to investigate the case of every pupil , and , by authority , to restrain him to such a course of study , exercise , and repose , as his physical system requires . The Writer has found , by experience , that , in a large institution , there is one class of pupils who need to be restrained , by penalties , from late hours and excessive study , as much as another class need stimulus to industry . A third cause of mental disease , is , the want of  | the appropriate exercise of the various faculties of the mind . On this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by disuse , muscle becomes emaciated , bone softens , blood-vessels are obliterated , and nerves lose their characteristic structure . The brain is no exception to this general rule . Of it , also , the tone is impaired by permanent inactivity , and it becomes less fit to manifest the mental powers with readiness and energy . " It is " the withdrawal of the stimulus necessary for its healthy exercise , which renders solitary confinement so severe a punishment , even to the most daring minds . It is a lower degree of the same cause , which renders continuous seclusion from society so injurious , to both mental and bodily health . " " Inactivity of intellect and of feeling is a very frequent predisposing cause of every form of nervous disease . For demonstrative evidence of this position , we have only to look at the numerous victims to be found among " persons " who have no call to exertion in gaining the means of subsistence , and no objects of interest on which to exercise their mental faculties , and who consequently sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If we look abroad upon society , we shall find innumerable examples of mental and nervous debility from this cause . When a person of some mental capacity is confined , for a long time , to an unvarying round of employment , which affords neither scope nor stimulus for one half of his faculties , and , from want of education or society , has no external resources ; his mental powers , for want of exercise , " " become blunted , and his perceptions slow and dull . " " The intellect and feelings , not being provided with interests external to themselves , must either become inactive and weak , or work upon themselves and become diseased . " " The most frequent victims of this kind of pre-  | disposition , are females of the middle and higher ranks , especially those of a nervous constitution , and good natural abilities ; but who , from an ill-directed education , possess nothing more solid than mere accomplishments , and have no materials of thought , " and no " occupation to excite interest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons to melancholy , hysteria , hypochondriasis , and other varieties of mental distress , really depends on a state of irritability of brain , induced by imperfect exercise . " These remarks , of a medical man , illustrate the principles before indicated ; ? namely , that the demand of Christianity , that we live to promote the general happiness , and not merely for selfish indulgence , has for its aim , not merely the general good , but the highest happiness , of the individual of whom it is required . A person possessed of wealth , who has nothing more noble to engage his attention , than seeking his own personal enjoyment , subjects his mental powers and moral feelings to a degree of inactivity , utterly at war with health of mind . And the greater the capacities , the greater are the sufferings which result from this cause . Any one , who has read the misanthropic wailings of Lord Byron , has seen the necessary result ' of great and noble powers bereft of their appropriate exercise , and , in consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the subject , which has often awakened feelings of sorrow and anxiety in the mind of the Writer , while aiding in the developement and education of superior female minds , in the wealthier circles . Not because there are not noble objects for interest and effort , abundant , and within reach of such minds ; but because long-established custom has made it seem so Quixotic , to the majority , even of the professed followers of Christ , for a woman of wealth to practise any great self-denial ,  | that few have independence of mind and Christian principle sufficient to overcome such an influence . The more a mind has its powers developed , the more does it aspire and pine after some object worthy of its energies and affections ; they are commonplace and phlegmatic characters , who are most free from such deep-seated wants . Many a young woman , of fine genius and elevated sentiment , finds a charm in Lord Byron 's writings , because they present a glowing picture of what , to a certain extent , must be felt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , than the pursuit of its own gratification . If young ladies of wealth and standing could pursue their education under the full conviction that the increase of their powers and advantages increased their obligations to use all for the good of society , and with some plan of benevolent enterprise in view , what new motives of interest would be added to their daily pursuits ! And what blessed results would follow to our beloved Country , if all welleducated females carried out the principles of Christianity in the exercise of their developed powers ! It is cheering to know that there are women , among the most intelligent and wealthy , who can be presented as examples of what may be done , when there is a heart to do . A pupil of the Writer is among this number , who , though a rich heiress , on the close of her school life immediately commenced a course of self-denying benevolence in the cause of education . She determined to secure a superior female institution in her native place , which should extend the benefits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate charge . Finding no teacher on the ground , prepared to take the lead , and though herself a timid and retiring character , she began , with the aid of the governess in her 17  | mother 's family , a daily school , superintending all , and teaching six hours a day . The liberal-minded and intelligent mother cooperated , and the result is a flourishing female seminary , with a large and beautiful and well-furnished building ; the greater part of the means being supplied by the mother , and almost all by the members of that family connection . And both these ladies will testify , that no time or money , spent for any other object , has ever secured to them more real and abiding enjoyment , than witnessing the results of this successful and benevolent enterprise , which , for years to come , will pour forth blessings on society . Another lady could be pointed out , who , possessing some property , went into a new western village , built and furnished her schoolhouse , and established herself there , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to intelligence and virtue . And in repeated instances , among the friends and pupils of the Writer , young ladies have left wealthy homes , and affectionate friends , to find nobler enjoyments in benevolent and active exertions to extend intelligence and virtue where such disinterested laborers were needed . In other cases , where it was not practicable to leave home , well-educated young ladies have interested themselves in common schools in the vicinity , aiding the teachers , by their sympathy , counsel , add personal assistance . Other ladies , of property and standing , having families to educate , and being well qualified for such duties , have relinquished a large portion of domestic labor and superintendence , which humbler minds could be hired to perform , and received other less fortunate children , to share with their own these superior advantages . But , so long as the feeling widely exists , that the increase of God 's bounties diminishes the obligations of self-denying service for the good of mankind , so long well-educated women ,  | in easy circumstances , will shrink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there are many most benevolent and intelligent women in this Country , who would gladly engage in such enterprises , were there any appropriate way within their reach . And it is a question , well deserving consideration among those who guide the public mind in benevolent enterprises , whether some organization is not demanded , which shall bring the religious community to act systematically , in voluntary associations to extend a proper education to every child in this Nation , and to bring into activity all the female enterprise and benevolence now lying dormant , for want of proper facilities to exercise them . There are hundreds of villages , which need teachers , and that would support them , if they were on the spot , but which never will send for them . And there are hundreds of females , now unemployed , who would teach , if a proper place and home and support and escort were provided for them . And there needs to be some enlarged and systematic plan , conducted by wise and efficient men , to secure these objects . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed that many female minds , now suffering from diseases occasioned by want of appropriate objects for their energies , would be relieved . The duties of a teacher exercise every intellectual faculty , to its full extent ; while , in this benevolent service , all the social , moral , and benevolent , emotions , are kept in full play . The happiest persons the Writer has ever known , ? those who could say that they were as happy as they wished to be in this world , ( and she has seen such , ) ? were persons engaged in this employment . The indications of a diseased mind , owing to a want of the proper exercise of its powers , are apathy , discontent , a restless longing for excitement , a crav-  | ing for unattainable good , a diseased and morbid action of the imagination , dissatisfaction with the world , and factitious interest in trifles which the mind feels to be unworthy of its powers . Such minds sometimes seek alleviation in exciting amusements ; others resort to the grosser enjoyments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or over-excitement , or apathy , the body fails under the wearing process , and adds new causes of suffering to the mind . It is to such that the compassionate Saviour calls to his service in such appropriate terms , " Come unto Me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . Take my yoke upon you , and learn of Me , " " and ye shall find rest unto your souls . " CHAPTER XVIII . ON THE CARE OF DOMESTICS . No Subject on which American Women need more Wisdom , Patience , Principle , and Self-control . Its Difficulties . Necessary Evils , Miseries of Aristocratic Lands . Wisdom of Conforming to Actual Circumstances . How to judge correctly respecting Domestics . They should be treated as we would expect to be under similar Circumstances . When Labor is scarce , its Value is increased . Instability of Domestics ; how it may be remedied . Pride and Insubordination ; how remedied . Abhorrence of Servitude a National Trait of Character . Domestics easily convinced of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be easily induced to be respectful in their Deportment , and appropriate in their Dress . Deficiences of Qualifications for the Performance of their Duties ; how remedied . Forewarning , better than Chiding . Preventing , better than finding Fault . Faults should be pointed out in a Kind Manner . Some Employers think it their Office and Duty to find Fault . Domestics should be regarded with Sympathy and Forbearance . THERE iS no point , where the women of this Country need more wisdom , patience , principle , and  | self-control , than in relation to those whom they employ in domestic service . The subject is attended with many difficulties , which powerfully influence the happiness of families ; and the following suggestions are offered , to aid in securing right opinions and practice . One consideration , which it would be well to bear in mind , on this subject , is , that a large portion of the peculiar trials , which American women suffer from this source , are the necessary evils connected with our most valuable civil blessings . Every blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same source ; and , in this case , while we rejoice at a state of society which so much raises the condition and advantages of our sex , the evils involved should be regarded as more than repaid , by the compensating advantages . If we can not secure the cringing , submissive , well-trained , servants of aristocratic lands , let us be consoled that we thus escape from the untold miseries and oppression which always attend that state of society . Instead , then , of complaining that we can not have our own peculiar advantages , and those of other nations , too ; or imagining how much better off we should be , if things were different from what they are , it is much wiser and more Christianlike to strive cheerfully to conform to actual circumstances ; and , after remedying all that we can control , patiently submit to what is beyond our power . If domestics are found to be incompetent , unstable , and unconformed to their station , it is Perfect Wisdom which appoints these trials , to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discipline is met in a proper spirit , it will prove a blessing , rather than an evil . But , to judge correctly in regard to some of the evils involved in the state of domestic service , in this Country , we should endeavor to conceive our-17  | selves placed in the situation of those , of whom complaint is made , that we may not expect , from them , any more than it would seem right should be exacted from us , in similar circumstances . It is sometimes urged , against domestics , that they exact exorbitant wages . But what is the rule of rectitude , on this subject ? Is it not the universal law , of labor and of trade , that an article is to be valued according to its scarcity and the demand ? When wheat is scarce , the farmer raises his price ; and when a mechanic offers services , difficult to be obtained , he has a corresponding increase of price . And why is it not right for domestics to act according to a rule allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions ? It is a fact , that really good domestic service must continue to increase in value , just in proportion as this Country waxes rich and prosperous ; thus making the proportion of those , who wish to hire labor , relatively greater , and the number of those , willing to go to service , less . Money enables the rich to gain many advantages , which those of more limited circumstances can not secure ; and one of these , is , securing good domestics , by offering high wages : and this , as the scarcity of this class increases , will serve constantly to raise the price of service . It is right for domestics to charge the market value , and this value is always decided by the scarcity of the article and the amount of demand . Right views of this subject , will sometimes serve to diminish hard feelings towards those , who would otherwise be wrongfully regarded as unreasonable and exacting . Another complaint against domestics , is , that of instability and discontent , leading to perpetual change . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive of their own circumstances as so changed , that the daughter must go out to service . Suppose a place is engaged , and it is then found that  | she must sleep in a comfortless garret ; and that , when a new domestic comes , perhaps a coarse and dirty foreigner , she must share her bed with her . Another place is offered , where she can have a comfortable room , and an agreeable room-mate : in such a case , would not both mother and daughter think it right to change ? Or , suppose , on trial , it was found that the lady of the house was fretful , or exacting and hard to please ; or , that her children were so ungoverned , as to be perpetual vexations ; or , that the work was so heavy that no time was allowed for relaxation and the care of a wardrobe ; ? and another place offers , where these evils can be escaped : would not mother and daughter here think it right to change ? And is it not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek places where they can be most comfortable ? In some cases , this instability and love of change would be remedied , if employers would take more pains to make a residence with them agreeable ; and to attach domestics to the family , by feelings of gratitude and affection . There are ladies , even where such domestics are most rare , who seldom find any trouble in keeping good and steady ones . And the reason is , that their domestics know they can not better their condition , by any change within reach . It is not merely by giving them comfortable rooms , and good food , and presents , and privileges , that the attachment of domestics is secured ; it is by the manifestation of a friendly and benevolent interest in their comfort and improvement . This is exhibited , bearing patiently with their faults ; in kindly teaching them how to improve ; in showing them how to make and take proper care of their clothes ; in guarding their health ; in teaching them to read , if necessary , and supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by endeavoring , so far as may be , to supply the place of a parent . It is seldom , that  | such a course would not secure steady service , and such affection and gratitude , that even higher wages would not tempt them away . There would probably be some cases of ungrateful returns ; but there is no doubt that the course indicated , if generally pursued , would very much lessen the evil in question . Another subject of complaint , in regard to domestics , is , their pride , insubordination , and a spirit not conformed to their condition . They are not willing to be called servants ; in some places , they claim a seat , at meals , with the family ; they imitate a style of dress unbecoming their condition ; and their manners and address are rude and disrespectful . That these evils are very common , among this class of persons , can not be denied ; the only question is , how can they best be met and remedied . In regard to the common feeling among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " servants , " there is need of some consideration and allowance . It should be remembered , that , in this Country , children , from their earliest years , are trained to abhor servitude , in reference to themselves , as the greatest of all possible shame and degradation . They are perpetually hearing orations , songs , and compositions of all sorts , which set forth the honor and dignity of freemen , and heap scorn and contempt on all who would be so mean as to be slaves . Now the term servant , and the duties it involves , are , in the minds of many persons , nearly the same as those of the slave . And there are few minds , entirely free from associations which make servitude a degradation . It is not always pride , then , which makes this term so offensive . It is a consequence of that noble and generous spirit of freedom , which every American draws from his mother 's breast , and which ought to be respected , rather than despised . In order to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the ruder classes of soci-  | ety make claims , deemed forward and offensive , when , with their views , such a position seems indispensable to preserve a proper self-respect . Where an excessive sensibility on this subject exists , and forward and disrespectful manners result from it , the best remedy is , a kind attempt to give correct views , such as better-educated minds are best able to attain . It should be shown to them , that , in this Country , labor has ceased to be degrading , in any class ; that , in all classes , different grades of subordination must exist ; and that it is no more degrading for a domestic to regard the heads of a family as superiors in station , and treat them with becoming respect , than it is for children to do the same , or for men to treat their rulers with respect and deference . They should be taught , that domestics use a different entrance to the house , and sit at a distinct table , not because they are inferior beings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order and convenience . They can be shown , if it is attempted in a proper spirit and manner , that these very regulations really tend to their own ease and comfort , as well as to that of the family . The Writer has known cases , where the lady of the family , for the sake of convincing her domestic of the truth of these views , allowed her tO follow her own notions , for a short time , and join the family at meals . It was merely required , as a condition , that she should always dress her hair as the other ladies did , and appear in a clean dress , and abide by all the rules of propriety at table , which the rest were required to practise , and which were duly detailed . The experiment was tried , two or three times ; and , although the domestic was treated with studious politeness and kindness , she soon felt that she should be much more comfortable in the kitchen , where she could talk , eat , and dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to feel the propriety of allowing a family opportunity to talk freely of their private affairs , when they meet at meals , as they never could do , if restrained by the constant presence of a stranger . Such views , presented in a kind and considerate manner , will often entirely change the views of a domestic who is sensitive on such subjects . When a domestic is forward and bold in manners , and disrespectful in address , a similar course can be pursued . It can be shown , that those , who are among the best-bred and genteel , have courteous and respectful manners and language to all they meet , while many , who have wealth , are regarded as vulgar , because they exhibit rude and disrespectful manners . The very term , gentleman , indicates the refinement and delicacy of address , which distinguishes the high-bred from the coarse and vulgar . In regard to appropriate dress , in most cases it is difficult for an employer to interfere directly with comments or advice . The most successful mode , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobe , and when a confidence in the kindness of feeling is thus gained , remarks and suggestions will generally be properly received , and new views of propriety and economy can be imparted . In some cases , it may be well for an employer , ? who , from appearances , anticipates difficulty of this kind , ? in making the agreement , to state that she wishes to have the room , person , and dress of her domestics kept neat , and . in order , and that she expects to remind them of their duty , in this particular , if it is neglected . Domestics are very apt to neglect the care of their own chambers and clothing ; and such habits have a most pernicious influence on their wellbeing , and on that of their children in future domestic life . An employer , then , is bound to exercise a parental care over them , in these respects .  | In regard to the great deficiencies of domestics , in qualifications for their duties , much patience and benevolence are required . Multitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in such cases , how unreasonable it would be to expect it of them ! Most persons , of this class , depend for their knowledge , in domestic affairs , not on their parents , who usually are not qualified to instruct them , but on their employers ; and if they live in a family where nothing , is done neatly and properly , they have no chance to learn how to perform their duties well . When a lady finds that she must employ a domestic who is ignorant , awkward , and careless , her first effort should be , to make all proper allowance for past want of instruction , and the next , to remedy the evil , by kind and patient teaching . In doing this , it should ever be borne in- mind , that nothing is more difficult , than to change old habits , and to learn to be thoughtful and considerate . And a woman must make up her mind to tell the same thing " over and over again , " and yet not lose her patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arrival of a new domestic , the mistress of the family , or a daughter , fox two or three days , will go round with the novice , and show the exact manner in which it is expected the work will be done . And this , also , it may be well to specify in the agreement , as some domestics would otherwise resent such a supervision . But it is often remarked , that , after a woman has taken all this pains to instruct a domestic , and make her a good one , some other person will offer higher wages , and she will leave . This , doubtless , is a sore trial ; but still , if such efforts were made in the true spirit of benevolence , the lady will still have her reward , in the consciousness that she has contributed to the welfare of society , by making one more good domestic , and one more comfortable family where  | that domestic is employed ; and if the latter becomes the mother of a family , a whole circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mistake , not unfrequently made , in the management both of domestics and of children ; and that is , in supposing that the way to cure defects , is by finding fault as each failing occurs . But , instead of this being true , in many cases the directly opposite course is the best ; while , in all instances , much good judgement is required , in order to decide when to notice faults , and when to let them pass unnoticed . There are some minds , very sensitive , easily discouraged , and infirm of purpose . Such persons , when they have formed habits of negligence , haste , and awkwardness , often need expressions of sympathy and encouragement , rather than reproof . They usually have been found fault with , so much , that they have become either hardened or desponding ; and it is often the case , that a few words of commendation " will awaken fresh efforts and renewed hope . In almost every case , words of kindness , hope , and encouragement , should be mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , in reference to this point , to forewarn , instead of finding fault . Thus , when a thing has been done wrong , let it pass unnoticed , till it is to be done again ; and then , a simple request , to have it done in the right way , will secure quite as much , and probably more , willing effort , than a reproof administered for neglect . Some persons seem to take it for granted , that young and inexperienced minds are bound to have all the forethought and discretion of mature persons ; and freely express wonder and disgust , when mishaps occur for want of these traits . But it would be far better to save from mistake or forgetfulness , by previous caution and care on the part of those who have gained experience and forethought ; and thus many occasions of complaint and ill humor will be avoided .  | Grown persons , who fill the places of heads of families , are very apt to forget how painful it is to be chided for neglect of duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in imagination , put themselves in the place of those whom they control , and conceive of some person as daily administering reproof to them , and pointing out their faults , in the same tone and style as they employ to those under their control , it might serve as a useful check . It is often the case , that persons , who are most strict and exacting , and least able to make allowances and receive palliations , are themselves peculiarly sensitive to any thing which implies that they are in fault . By such , the spirit implied in the Divine petition , " forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us , " especially needs to be cherished . One other consideration is very important . There is no duty , more binding on Christians , than that of patience and meekness under provocations and disappointment . Now the tendency of every sensitive mind , when thwarted in its wishes , is to complain and find fault , and often in tones of fretfulness or anger . But there are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to know that angry or fretful fault-finding , from the mistress of a family , when her work is not done to suit her , is not in agreement with the precepts of Christ . They notice and feel the inconsistency ; and every woman , when she gives way to feelings of anger and impatience at the faults of those around her , lowers herself in their respect , while her owi conscience , unless very much blinded , can not but suffer a wound . There are some women , who , in the main , are amiable , who seem to feel that it is their ; office and duty to find fault with their domestics , whenever any thing is not exactly right , and follow their fancied calling without the least appearance of ten 18  | derness or sympathy , as if the objects of their discipline were stocks or stones , without human feelings . The writer once heard a domestic , describing her situation in a family which she had left , make this remark of her past employer : " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us many privileges and presents ; but if we ever did any thing wrong , she always talked to us just as if she thought we had no feelings , and I never was so unhappy in my life as while living with her . " And this was said of a kind-hearted and conscientious woman , by a very reasonable and amiable domestic . Every woman , who has the care of domestics , should cultivate a habit of regarding them with that sympathy and forbearance , which she would wish for herself or her daughters , if deprived of parents , fortune , and home . The fewer advantages they have enjoyed , and the greater difficulties of temper or of habit they have to contend with , the more claims they have on compassionate forbearance . They ought ever to be looked upon , not as the mere ministers to our comfort and convenience , but as the humbler and more neglected children of our Heavenly Father , whom he has sent to claim our sympathy and aid. * " The excellent little work of Miss Sedgwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' contains many valuable and useful hints , conveyed in a most pleasing narrative form , which every housekeeper would do well to read .

EVERY young lady ought to learn how to take proper care of an infant ; for , even if she never becomes the responsible nurse in the care of one , she will always be mingling with those who have : and such knowledge and experience will often be of great value , in enabling her to render benevolent aid to others . To illustrate this , a case will be mentioned , which fell under the notice of the Writer . An inexperienced young mother was travelling with her infant , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of proper care , the infant became restless and sick , while its cries annoyed the mother and the passengers . To prevent this , she was constantly administering doses of paregoric ; but this finally failed to quiet the child . At last , the mother lost all patience and energy ; and seemed to fall into a  | sort of stupor of indifference and weariness . A young lady on board , who had been instructed in the care of infants , at this point volunteered to take charge of the child , if the mother would give it up entirely to her discretion . The offer was accepted ; and the young lady then proceeded to cleanse the head and skin of the little sufferer , which were in a shocking state , from long neglect . She put on dry and warm clothing , and prepared suitable medicine and food . The child was speedily quieted and restored , by this judicious management , and the young nurse was more than repaid , by the smiles of the little sufferer , and the gratitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while visiting in one of the newest western States , the Writer had occasion to realize the irnportance of knowledge , and experience in these matters , to young mothers . A lady in the neighborhood became the mother of her firstborn ; and , though in a town containing fifteen hundred inhabitants , there was not , so far as was known , in the place , a nurse , for such emergencies , and the service was performed by the ladies of the neighborhood . With no attendant , but an inexperienced young husband , and with no domestic , but a girl of twelve , all the care of an infant , and all the responsibility of directing about its management , came upon the mother , in this anxious and feeble state . What mother can be sure that her daughter is not destined to meet similar trials and anxieties ? The following extracts from Dr. Combe 's Physiology of Digestion , * contain information with which every woman should be familiar . " Those whose opportunities of observation have been extensive , will agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths occurring during the + Issued by the Publishers of this Work .  | first two years of existence , are ascribable to mismanagement , and to errors in diet . At birth , the stomach is feeble , and as yet unaccustomed to food . Its cravings are consequently easily satisfied , and frequently renewed . " " At that early age , there ought to be no fixed time for giving nourishment . The stomach can not be thus satisfied . In one child , digestion may be slow , and the interval be consequently too short ; in another , it may he quick , and the interval too long . But the active call of the infant is a sign , which needs never be mistaken , and none else ought to be listened to . " Many mothers consider every expression of uneasiness as an indication of appetite , " and offer it food , although ten minutes may not have elapsed since its preceding repast . Nothing can be more injurious than this custom . It overloads and oppresses the stomach ; excites griping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfrequently leads to fatal diseases in the brain . " " It is astonishing , indeed , with what exclusiveness of understanding eating is regarded , even by intelligent parents , as the grand solatiurn , or panacea for all the pains and troubles which afflict the young . " " Because the mouth is open , when the child is crying , " " parents jump to the conclusion , that it is open for the purpose of being filled . " " Let appetite , then , be the only rule ; " " and do not attempt to provoke it . " f ? The lower animals instinctively avoid this error , " and " rather allow themselves to be strongly solicited , before yielding to the wishes of their young . " " t When the system has become more developed , and the stomach accustomed to the exercise of its functions , regularity in the distribution of its meals may be gradually and beneficially introduced . " " Through pure ignorance , and mistaken kindness , many nurses , imagining themselves wiser than Na-18  | tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be starving , " " hasten to fill its stomach . " " Not unfrequently severe indigestion is thus induced . " " At birth " " the stomach and bowels , never having been used , " " contain a quantity of mucous secretion , " " which requires to be removed . " " To effect this object , Nature has rendered the first portions of the mother 's milk purposely watery and laxative ; and , on the part of the infant , nothing further is required , than to allow it to follow its natural instinct . " " Nurses , however , distrusting Nature , often hasten to administer castor oil , or some other active purgative ; " and the consequence is , " irritation in the stomach and bowels , which is not always easily subdued . " " In early infancy , when no teeth exist , " milk is " the only food intended by Nature . " If " the mother 's milk is scanty , " " cow 's milk , diluted with one third of water , and slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable than any preparation of milk and flour or arrow-root . " " It is a common mistake , to suppose , that , because a woman is nursing , she ought to live very fully , and to add an allowance of wine , porter , or other fermented liquor , to her usual diet . The only result of this plan , is , to cause an unnatural degree of fulness in the system , which places the nurse on the brink of disease , " and retards , rather than increases , the food of the infant . " More will be . gained by the observance of the ordinary laws of health , on the part of the nurse , than by any foolish deviation , founded on ignorance . " " After a child has been weaned , panado , gruel , thin arrow-root , tapioca , sago , rusk , or crust of bread , " fruit , " fresh milk and water and sugar , " may be given . On the , subject of giving animal food to young children , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinary to the Queen of England , expresses the views of most of the celebrated physicians .  | There is no greater error in the management of children , than that of giving them animal diet very early . " " By persevering in the use of an overstimulating diet , the digestive organs become irritated , and the various secretions , immediately connected with , and necessary to , digestion , are diminished , especially the biliary secretion ; " and " constipation of the bowels , and congestion of the abdominal circulation succeed . " " Children so fed , become , moreover , very liable to attacks of fever and of inflammation , affecting , particularly , the mucous membranes ; and measles , and the other diseases incident to childhood , are generally severe in their attack . " In reference to this last remark , a distinguished medical gentleman mentioned to the Writer , that , in families where children lived on simple diet , without tea and coffee , if they were seized with measles , whooping cough , mumps , and similar diseases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no danger ; but that in families where an opposite course was pursued , he always expected trouble . In regard to the importance of giving animal food to children , at all , there are many popular notions , which are very incorrect . Many seem to think that animal food is more nourishing than vegetable , and , when a child is weak and thin , will for this reason give it meat . This is an entire mistake . Experiments , repeatedly made by chemists , prove the contrary ; and tables are made out , showing the relative amount of nourishment in each kind of food . From these tables , it appears , that , while beef contains thirty-five per cent . of nutritious matter , rice and wheat contain from eighty to ninety-five per cent . One pound of rice , then , contains as much nourishment as two pounds and a half of beef . The reason why meat has been supposed to be more nourishing , is that , on account of its stimulating property , the  | stomach works faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat diet produces a temporary loss of strength , just as the withdrawal of other stimulants are followed by consequent languor . Another mistake , is , the common supposition , that the formation of the human teeth and stomach indicate that man was designed to feed on flesh . But this is contrary to the testimony of all the most distinguished naturalists . Linna ; us says , that the organization of man , when compared with other animals , shows , that " fruits and esculent vegetables constitute his most suitable food . " Baron Cuvier , the highest authority on comparative anatomy , says , " the natural food of man , judging from his structure , appears to consist of fruits , roots , and other succulent parts of vegetables . " Mr. Thomas Bell , Lecturer in Guy 's Hospital , in a work on the natural and proper food for man , as deducible from the construction of his teeth and stomach , says , " every fact , connected with human organization , goes to prove , that man was originally formed a frugivorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any weight , " those animals , whose teeth and digestive apparatus most nearly resemble our own , namely , the apes and monkeys , are undoubtedly frugivorous . " Another common mistake , is , that the stimulus of animal food is necessary for the full developement of the physical and intellectual powers . On this subject , Professor Lawrence , a distinguished writer , says , " that animal food renders man strong and courageous , is fully disproved , by the inhabitants of Lapland , Kamschatka , and Patagonia , who , living solely on animal food , are among the smallest , weakest , and most timid of races . " On the contrary , the Scotch Highlanders , who , in a very cold latitude , live , most of them , exclusively on vegetable diet , are among the stoutest , largest , and most athletic of  | men . The South-Sea Islanders , in a tropical clime , feed almost exclusively on fruits and vegetables ; and yet it is testified , that " the stoutest and most expert English sailors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Africa , the stoutest and largest races live exclusively on vegetables ; and the bright and active Arabs live entirely on milk and vegetables . The greatest portion of those , who have lived to a remarkable and robust old age , have been persons of abstemious habits , whose diet was almost exclusively vegetables . Sir John Sinclair , an eminent British surgeon , says , " I have wandered a good deal about the world ; my health has been tried in all ways ; and , by the aid of temperance and hard work , I have worn out two armies , in two wars , and probably could wear out another . " " I eat no animal food , drink no wine , " " or spirits of any kind . " Henry Jenkins lived to the age of one hundred and sixty-nine years , on a low coarse simple diet . Thomas Parr died at the age of one hundred " and fifty-two years , and his diet was coarse bread , milk , cheese , whey , and small beer . The early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived exclusively on vegetables , to a great age . James the Hermit lived to the age of one hundred and four years , Arsenius to one hundred and twenty , St. Epiphanius to one hundred and fifty , and Romaldus to one hundred and twenty . It is stated , too , as a wellknown and undisputed fact , that the pulse of a hardy ; robust man , who lives on simple vegetable diet , is from ten to thirty beats less in a minute than that of men who live on a mixed diet . The teeth , also , of those nations who live on such simple diet , are white and enduring , and extreme contrasts to those of people who live on more stimulating food . The result of the treatment of young children in the  | Orphan Asylum , at Albany , New York , is one upon which all who have the care of young children , should deeply ponder . This institution was established in 1829 ? 1830 ; and , during the six succeeding years , its average number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their diet was meat once a day , fine bread , rice , Indian puddings , vegetables , fruits , and milk . Considerable attention was given to clothing , fresh air , and exercise ; and they were bathed once in three weeks . During these three years , from four to six children were continually on the sick list , and sometimes more ; one or two assistant nurses were necessary ; a physician was called two or three times a week ; and in this time there were between thirty and forty deaths . At the end of this time , the management was changed , in these respects . Daily ablutions of the whole body were practised ; bread of unbolted flour was substituted for that of fine wheat ; and all animal food was banished . More attention was also paid to clothing , bedding , fresh air , and exercise . The result was , that the nursery was vacated , the nurse and physician no longer needed , and for two years not a single case of sickness or death occurred . The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of two idiots , and one other child , all of whom were new inmates , who had not been subjected to this treatment . Their teachers also testified that there was a very manifest increase of intellectual vigor and activity , while there was much less irritability of temper . Many persons suppose , that meat diet is more needful in a cold than in a warm climate ; but in some of the coldest portions of Russia , a hardy and vigorous peasantry subsist wholly on vegetable diet ; and a very intelligent gentleman , who spent many months in Siberia , testifies , that no exiles endure the climate better than those , who have  | all their lives been accustomed to a simple vegetable diet . There is another fact , in relation to coarse bread , worthy of notice . Under the administration of William Pitt , for two years or more , there was such a scarcity of wheat , that Parliament passed a iaw , that , to make it hold out longer , the army should have all their bread made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the soldiers improved so much , as to be a subject of surprise to themselves , the officers , and the physicians . These last came o it publicly , and declared , that the soldiers never before were so robust and healthy ; and that disease= had nearly disappeared from the army . TL . . tic physicians joined and pronounced it the healthiest bread ; and , for a time , schools , families , and public institutions , used it almost exclusively . Even the nobility , convinced by these facts , adopted it for their common diet ; and the fashion continued a long time after the scarcity ceased , until more luxurious habits resumed their sway . In regard to the intellect , Dr. Franklin asserted , from his own experience , that an exclusive vegetable diet " promotes clearness of ideas and quickness of perception ; and is to be preferred by all who labor with the mind . " The mightiest efforts of Sir Isaac Newton were performed while he was nourished only by bread and water ; and many others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual labors , sustained only by this simple diet . These facts , to say the least , prove that animal food is not necessary either to the physical or intellectual perfection of our race . The following extracts from a late Treatise by Dr. Combe , relate to other topics of infant management . " Of all the defects which a nurse can have , none is more directly destructive of infant life , than that  | in which many mothers , as well as nurses , indulge , of administering , of their own accord , strong and dangerous medicines to children . " " It appears , from a late return , printed by order of the House of Commons , of all inquests held in England and Wales , in 1837 and 1838 , in cases of death from poison , that " " nearly one seventh of the whole number resulted from the carelessness of mothers and nurses , in administering medicines , with the properties of which they were not acquainted , in doses far beyond those in which they are ever prescribed by medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-two infants were killed by giving preparations containing opium , and twenty were destroyed by other powerful agents . The Coroner of Nottingham reported , that great numbers in that borough were destroyed , every year , by taking Godfrey 's Cordial ; but he remarks , " as they die off gradually , " they do not come into his report , as coroner . " In addition to cases of absolute poisoning , of the above description , it is well known to practitioners , that much havoc is made among infants , by the abuse of calomel and other medicines , which procure momentary relief , but end by producing incurable disease ; and it has often excited my astonishment , to see how recklessly remedies of this kind are had recourse to , on the most trifling occasions , by mothers and nurses , who would be horrified , if they knew the nature of the power they are wielding , and the extent of injury they are inflicting . Whenever a child shows any symptom of uneasiness , instead of inquiring whether it may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires to be avoided in future , to remove the suffering , many mothers act as if it were indispensably necessary to interfere immediately and forcibly with the operations of Nature , by giving some powerful medicine to counteract its effects ; and if relief does  | not ensue , ' within an hour or two , the dose must be repeated . In this way , it is not uncommon for a medical man to be sent for , in alarm , and told , that the child began to complain at such a time ; that , notwithstanding that a large dose of calomel , or laudanum , or tincture of rhubarb , was immediately given , and repeated every hour or two , it is still very ill , or becoming hourly worse ; and that , if he canriot do something , instantly , it will soon be beyond recovery . Whereas , it may appear , on examination , that there was , at first , only a slight indisposition , which required no active treatment , at all , and that the urgent symptoms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are eases of diseases , in which very active means must be promptly used , to save the child , is perfectly true . But it is not less certain , that these are cases , of which no mother or nurse ought to attempt the treatment . As a general rule , indeed , where the child is well managed , medicine , of any kind , is very rarely required ; and if disease were more generally regarded in its true light , not as a something thrust into the system , which requires to be expelled by force , but as an aberration from a natural mode of action , produced by some external cause , we should be in less haste to attack it by medicine , and more watchful , and therefore more successful , in our management , and in its prevention . Accordingly , where a constant demand for medicine exists in a nursery , the mother may rest assured , that there is something essentially wrong in the treatment of her children . " Dr. Combe further remarks , " All women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become mothers ; but how very small is the number of those , who are unconnected , by family ties , friendship , or sympathy , with the children of others ! How very few are there , who , at some time or other of their lives , ' 19  | would not find their usefulness and happiness increased , by the possession of a kind of knowledge so intimately allied to their best feelings and affections ! And how important is it , to the mother herself , that her efforts should be seconded by intelligent , instead of ignorant , assistants ! " " In all points of view , every right-minded woman has an interest " " in removing the ignorance , in which this subject has been involved , " from her own mind , and the minds of others . " It may , indeed , be alleged , that mothers require no knowledge of the laws of the infant constitution , or of the principles of infant management , because medical aid is always at hand , to correct their errors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil is clone , and health is broken ; and even if they were , it requires intelligence and information in the mother , " properly to obey their directions . Dr. Bell remarks , " Physicians would confer an essential service on the community , if they were to take more pains to divert . the curiosity of their patients and invalids from medical matters to questions relating to the health and vigor of the functions of the organs , and to the means of avoiding disease . " The Writer , in reference to the above remark , would inquire , whether the prevalence of empiricism , and of quack medicines , would not be most effectually stopped , by giving the common people , in all possible ways , a knowledge of the wonderful and delicate construction of the several organs of life , and of the causes which operate to produce their diseased action ? Such views would instantly convince any mind of common sense , that ignorant men can not be qualified to administer medicine ; and that medical drugs , given without a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases ; produce and increase disease , instead of curing it . Dr. Combe further remarks , " I have seen " " a  | nursery , " that was " like a paradise on earth , compared to one under the more ordinary guidance . In one of the latter kind , I lately saw a strong , and naturally healthy , infant , literally gasping for breath , and in a state bordering on convulsions , from extreme anxiety on the part of the parent , to exclude every breath of air , from a nursery overheated by a large fire , as a precaution against cold , which she supposed to have been the chief cause of the death of a former child . " " When I insisted on the admission of fresh air , " " she remonstrated , with all the earnestness of the most tender affection . With difficulty I carried the point , and remained to prevent the too speedy termination of the experiment . In a few minutes , the uneasy twitching and contortion of the features ceased ; and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheerfulness took their place , and encouraged the mother to allow the continued entrance of some small portion of the air . " " The child took no cold , and required only fresh air , moderate diet , and exercise , to restore it to perfect health . " Dr. Bell observes , " the necessity of a continued supply of fresh air is manifested , in the construction of some of the rooms in many houses . These rooms have no fireplaces , and consequently , during night , if they are used for sleeping in , the doors and windows being shut , there is no channel , either for the introduction of air from the atmosphere without , or for the escape of the impure air , within , which latter is made in the processes of breathing and exhalation from the lungs and skin . " " The sufferings of " children of feeble constitutions , and of invalids , " are increased , beyond measure , by such lodgings as these . An action , brought by the Commonwealth , ought to lie against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which rooms are so constructed as not to allow of free ventilation ; and a writ of  | lunacy taken out against those , who , with the knowledge of the common elements of natural philosophy , or , indeed , with the common-sense experience which all have on this head , should spend any portion of their time , still more , should sleep , in rooms thus nearly air-tight . " " Parents , " in cities , " who are desirous that their children should avoid . bowel complaints , under various names , must contrive to ' change the air which their children breathe , by taking them into the country . " " The indispensable condition , in a vast number of cases , for the avoidance of disease , as well as for its cure , is the access of fresh and somewhat cooler air , both to the lung ? and skin . " This , also , is a condition " for restoration from the irritation , and feebleness , and fever , which harass so often in the Summer months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who can not go into the country , should " so manage , that their children shall enjoy , early in the morning , the air of some of the public squares of a city , " or " the still fresher air on the water , " in some ferry or steamboat . The money spent in giving a child fresh and cool air , every day , is well laid out ; and " these little excursions will be much cheaper , than the cost of medicine , to say nothing of professional attendance , and the necessary interruption of the domestic and other duties of the mother . " " It is desirable to allow the free access of the outer air , during the night , to bedrooms , " in hot weather . " If the inmates do not gain a cooler , they at any rate breathe a fresher , a more elastic , air , and suffer less . " The bed " should always he a mattrass , and a hard feather or hair pillow . A child , tossing about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a load of clothes , will often be revived , at once , and restored to sound and refreshing sleep , by putting it on a folded sheet , which again rests simply on a piece of matting or  | floor-cloth , and by throwing a light coverlet or sheet over it . " " Another , and a valuable resource , is afforded to all classes , in the use of a bath . Water , and a washtub , are the only conditions required for this purpose . " In cases of delicacy of constitution , " it is proper to raise a little the temperature of the water for the bath , so as to render it tepid , or slightly warm . " " After the morning bath , the child is better able to bear , without suffering , the great heat and close air of its lodging , should it unhappily be thus restricted . Friction , assiduously practised , on the whole skin , especially along the spine , and on the abdomen , and chest , and lower limbs , ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly irritable , " ( from teething , ) " it is of paramount necessity and duty to withhold all the nostrums , which have been so boastingly and so falsely lauded " as sovereign cures for cholera infanlum . " " The true restoratives to a child threatened with disease , at this season , are , cool air , cool bathing , - and cool drinks of simple water , in addition to its proper food , taken at stated intervals . " As cool weather approaches , the clothing must " be of a thicker substance and warmer texture : the feet particularly will require protection against sudden changes of temperature , as well as against moisture . " " Dr. Eberle , " says Dr. Combe , " has very properly called attention to a glaring inconsistency in infant clothing , which ought to be immediately remedied , and which consists in leaving the neck , shoulders , and arms , quite bare , while the rest of the body is kept abundantly warm . " " It has been supposed , ' he says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs are so much more common during the period of childhood , than at a more advanced age . ' " On this , Dr. Bell remarks , " Many are , we 19*  | fear , influenced to this , " " by a desire to imitate others , " and by " a love of exposing their beautiful breasts and round arms . " But what " has fashion to do with children , or they with fashion ? It is enough for mothers and grown daughters to be the victims to fashion , as when they parade with bare shoulders and tightly-corsetted waists , and papersoled shoes , without inflicting punishment on young beings , who , insensible to admiration , " " find no compensation for their sufferings in gratified vanity . " " The head , " says Dr. Combe , " is commonly kept too warm , in infancy ; " but Dr. Bell says , " a better practice is now getting into fashion . It is for the infant not to wear caps , at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced by " the infant being laid to sleep with the head immersed in a very soft warm pillow . " " This plan has the double disadvantage of " having one part of the head overheated , and the other entirely uncovered . " When the head is kept very warm , the nervous excitability is greatly increased , so that every change makes an impression on the infant , and any accidental irritation is more likely , to be followed by spasmodic or convulsive fits . " The preceding general views of medical writers , furnish the ground for several more minute directions . An infant should be washed all over , every morning , with warm water , and , in cool weather , in a warm room . The head should be thoroughly washed , and brushed clean with a soft brush . If , by neglect , a covering of dirt forms at the roots of the hair , the yolk of an egg , rubbed in and combed out while damp , will remove it without trouble . After washing , fine starch should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , under the knees and in the groins . A wrapper , high in the neck , with long sleeves , put on over the frock , and left open in front , is now  | very fashionable . This is to cover the neck and arms . It is safest to fasten the clothing of infants with strings and buttons . Woollen socks should be kept on the feet . In sleep , the child 's head should be uncovered , and its eyes shaded . An infant should not sleep on its mother 's arm , as it will be kept too warm , and from the fresh air . It should be daily carried or drawn in a wagon , in the fresh air ; but great pains should be taken , to protect the eyes from too much light . Blindness is very common , among children , in countries where mothers labor in the open air , on account of want of care in this respect . When an infant lives on cow 's milk , if it is sick , inquiry should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the animal , and the nature of its food , very much affects the child . In cities , cows fed on still slops never give healthy milk ; and city cows are very apt to be diseased , from want of proper food and care . The milk of a new-milch cow is best for an infant , as other milk is too old . In changing the food of children , at weaning , the following are safe and important rules . Do not give any stimulating food or drinks , such as tea , coffee , spices , pepper , mustard , and the like ; and the less animal food given , the better . The Writer knows a family of eleven children , all but one born with robust constitutions , and reared in the country , through early childhood , in fine health . But they were allowed to eat meat , twice a day , with butter and gravy ; and every one , in afterlife , suffered severely , either from chronic cutaneous eruptions , or from dyspepsy , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one escaped . Always give a large supply of fruit , or some coarse vegetable food , such as bread of unbolted flour , potatoes , and the like , to keep up a regular daily action  | of the bowels , by a due admixture of innutritious matter with that which is more nourishing . Avoid highly-concentrated nourishment , unmixed , such as sugar , sweetmeats , gellies , candy , and the like . Such are healthy only when eaten with a large mixture of other food . Do not give either food or drinks at a temperature exceeding blood heat . Give food at regular hours , and do not provoke the appetite by a variety : r , l When a child seems ill , first try the effect of fasting and free perspiration , that the system may rest and throw off the evil probably resulting from too much , or from improper food . If this does not succeed , apply to a physician . Avoid giving to children , fat , or any cooking combined with grease , as it tends to weaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretions .  | ON THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN .

Hours of School . Inquiries of Secretary of Massachusetts Board of Education , and Answers of Distinguished Physicians . IF the happiness of our race depend on the formation of habits of self-denying benevolence , then this ought to be the prominent object , in the minds of those who have the control of young children . As the commarrds of the Supreme Ruler are the only sure guide to a right course of benevolent action , submission of the will , to the will of a superior , is the best preparative for such a course of benevolent action . Submission of the will , ' self-denial , and benevolence , then , are the three most important habits to form in early life . In regard to habits of obedience , there have been two extremes , both of which need to be shunned . One is , a stern , unsympathizing maintenance of parental authority , demanding perfect and constant obedience , without any attempt to convince a child  | of the propriety and benevolence of the requisitions , and without any manifestation of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to meet , under this discipline . Children , under such discipline , grow up to fear their parents , rather than to love and confide in them , and some of the most valuable and happy-making principles of character are chilled or forever blasted . In shunning this danger , others pass to the other extreme , and put themselves on the footing of equals with their children , as if nothing were due to superiority of age and relation . Nothing is exacted , without the implied concession , that the child is to be the judge of the propriety of the requisition ; and reason and persuasion are employed , as if the parent had no right to command . This system produces a most pernicious influence . Children very soon perceive the position which they are thus allowed to occupy , and they take every advantage of it . They soon acquire habits of forwardness and self-conceit , assume disrespectful manners and address , maintain their views with incessant disputes , and yield with ill-humor and resentment , as if their rights were infringed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude of a superior in age , knowledge , and relation ; who has a perfect right to control every action of the child , and to exact respectful language and manners ; and , whenever an express command is given , to demand prompt obedience , without hesitation or dispute . But at the same time , care should be taken to make the child perceive that the requisitions are reasonable and benevolent ; designed both for the good of the child , and for the good of all . Grown persons are very apt to forget the value which children attach to things which a mature mind , having higher resources , regards as trifles . A lady , of great strength of mind and sensibility , once  | told the Author , that one of the most acute periods of suffering she could remember , was occasioned by her mother 's burning up some milkweed-silk . The child had found , for the first time , this shining and beautiful substance , was filled with delight at her discovery , and was planning its future uses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her mother , finding the carpet all strewed with it , hastily brushed it into the fire ; ' and , with so careless and indifferent an air , that the child fled away , almost distracted with grief and disappointment . The mother little realized the pain she had inflicted , but the child felt the unkindness so severely , that , for some time , her mother was an object almost of aversion . It is impossible to govern children , properly , especially those of strong and sensitive feelings , without a constant effort to appreciate the value they attach to their pursuits and enjoyments . And with this , should be maintained a habit of carefully explaining the necessity of all requisitions that try their feelings , and of expressing tender sympathy for their grief and disappointment . There is no way , in which those who govern children can gain so powerful and pleasing an influence over them , as by joining in their sports . By this method , a grown person learns to understand the feelings and interests of childhood , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , secures a degree of confidence and affection , which can be gained so easily in no other way . Those who help children along in their sports , with kindness and sympathy , are always favorites with them ; and , if qualified and disposed so to do , can exert more influence over them , than any other person . ' It is a great misfortune , to the children of this Nation , that so many fathers are absorbed in making money , for mere , show or physical enjoy-  | ments , and so many mothers engaged in using it for the same ignoble ends , that they find no time to share in the sports or pursuits of their children , and relinquish this most powerful mode of influence to domestics and playmates , who often use it for the most pernicious purposes . In sharing the sports of childhood , older persons never should relinquish the attitude of Superiors , or allow disrespectful manners or address . If a superior demand such deportment , it is never more cheerfully accorded , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful , by having their tastes and enjoyments so efficiently promoted . The Writer has often seen parents and teachers , engaged with children in the most boisterous sports , without a single violation of such proprieties . Next to the entire want of all government , the two most fruitful sources of mischief , in the management of children , are unsteadiness in government , and over-government . Most of those cases , in which the children of sensible and conscientious persons turn out badly , will be found to result from one or the other of these causes . Children are exposed to the evils of unsteady government , when those , who control them , are sometimes very strict and decided , in exacting obedience , and , at other times , let disobedience go unrebuked and unpunished . In such cases , the children , never knowing exactly when they can escape with impunity , are constantly tempted to make a trial . The bad effect of this system , on the temper , can be better appreciated , by reference to one important principle of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of desire , put beyond the reach of hope , do not agitate the mind with anxious wishes , nor produce regret , at being deprived of what is not hoped for . A child is never harassed with longings for any object , which he knows can  | never be obtained . It is in reference to objects which awaken desire , with some hope of attainment , that the mind suffers from regret and disappointment . And all the time the mind is aiming at some supposed good , and using efforts to gain it , opposition excites irritable feelings ; but the moment it is put beyond the reach of hope , such irritation ceases . In consequence of this principle , whenever a thing is denied or forbidden to children , who are under the control of persons of steady and decided government , they know that it is entirely out of their reach . The agitation of hope and desire of course ceases , and the mind turns to other objects . But children under the control of weak and indulgent parents , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a thing is denied , they do not know but that either coaxing may win it , or disobedience gain it , without any penalty ; and so they are kept in just that state of hope and uncertainty , which produces irritation , and tempts to insubordination . Such children are very apt to become irritable and fractious , while a constant warfare is kept up with those who govern them , destructive to the peace and harmony so important in domestic life . The Writer has heard parents , of such unsteady government , lamenting , that , while they punished their children more than most parents , it seemed to do little or no good ! Another class of persons , in aiming to avoid this evil , go to another extreme , and are very strict and pertinacious , in regard to every requisition . Such , keep the young mind in a state of constant apprehension , lest some of the multiplied requisitions be omitted , and a penalty be inflicted . The result of such management , is , that children gradually acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else they become excessively irritable or misanthropic . It is the merciful provision of our 20  | Creator , that the constant repetition of an evil gradually hardens the mind , till eventually it is borne with comparative indifference . This principle , designed for good , is sadly abused , when children become so inured to rebuke , that it produces little grief or contrition . To avoid these evils , it is a wise precaution , for those who govern children , in their ordinary intercourse to advise and request , rather than to command . The most important duties of life should be enforced by commands ; but all the little acts of heedlessness , or awkwardness , or ill-manners , so frequently occurring with children , should pass as instances of forgetfulness , and not as acts of direct disobedience . Whenever a child deliberately disobeys an express command , the penalty should always follow , as sure as the laws of Nature . This will be the most infallible preservative from voluntary and known disobedience . Children of active , heedless temperament , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remarks and deportment , are often essentially injured , by a want of patience and self-control in those who govern them . Such children often possess a morbid sensibility , which they strive to conceal , or a desire of love and approbation that preys like a famine on the soul . And yet , they become objects of ridicule and rebuke to almost every member of the family , until their sensibilities are tortured into obtuseness or misanthropy . Such children , above all others , need tenderness and sympathy . A thousand instances of mistake or forgetfulness should be passed over , in silence , while opportunities for commendation and encouragement should be diligently sought . In regard to the formation of habits of self-denial , tender and affectionate parents seem to forget the importance of inuring them to this duty , in early life . Instead of this , they seem to be constantly  | aiming , by seeking to gratify every wish , to remove every chance for forming so important a habit . Some parents , under this mistaken feeling , will maintain , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children may not join them in eating . But where can a parent , so effectually as at the daily meal , teach that government of the appetites , which is a lesson that children must learn or be ruined ? The food which is proper for grown persons , is often not suitable for children ; and this is a sufficient reason for accustoming them to see others partake of delicacies , which they must not share . Requiring children to wait till others are helped , and to refrain from conversation at table , except when addressed by their elders , is another mode of forming habits of self-denial and self-control . Requiring them to help others , first , and to offer the best to others , has a similar influence . The still more difficult duty of denying themselves , to promote the enjoyment of others , is a lesson which needs to be assiduously taught . But how few parents make this a definite object of interest and effort , although they will allow that it is the most important as well as the most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , which tends rather to cultivate selfishness . Thus , almost all motive , offered to stimulate children , are those which refer to mere self gratification . How few are the parents , who excite their children by the hope of good which others will secure ! And yet , very much might be done , to awaken the love of benevolent activity , if it were habitually and systematically attempted . Many parents have succeeded in leading their children to deny their appetites , for some benevolent object , with entire success . By similar efforts , they can be trained to give up their time , their property , or their sports , to add to the comforts , or relieve the wants of others . Let a parent make  | this a distinct and important object of effort , and much will be accomplished . Habits of honesty and veracity very much depend on the character , and example of parents . Children are creatures of sympathy and imitation ; and when they see that their parents and older friends are particular in respecting rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are led to similar uprightness . In inculcating these duties , it is important for older people to form exact and definite ideas , themselves , or they will often perplex children with inconsistencies . For example , when children are taught , that lying is saying what is not true , how often will they hear their parents or other older friends , either jocosely , or in other ways , say what is not strictly true ! So , if stealing is said to consist in taking or using what belongs to others , how often is this done by parents , and guardians , and for sufficient reasons ! Instead of this , children should be taught that intentional deceit is wrong ; and that lying is telling what is false , with an intention to deceive . So , stealing is taking or ' using the property of others , without proper evidence that the owner is willing . By these simple definitions , children can he shown , that sometimes people may say what . is not true , without intending to deceive , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive , when it is not their intention so to do : and that , in such cases , they may not do wrong . So there are cases , when we may know that persons are willing we should use their property , even without asking ; and in such cases , it is not stealing . Parents and teachers , also , have certain rights over the property of children , which should be explained . The effect of sympathy and example is very manifest , in some families , where the parents have very strict notions respecting truth and honesty . From  | early infancy , the children hear lying , deceit , and dishonesty , spoken of as mean , vulgar , cowardly , and wicked , and feeling a sympathy with those around , avoid these practices , very readily , and are never known to lie , or practise any deceitful or dishonest tricks . In other families , children will see their parents deceiving others , and practising many little artful or dishonest measures . Of course , such parents never can impart an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust for vices which they daily practise . There is no more important duty , devolving upon a mother , than the cultivation of habits of modesty and propriety in young children . All indecorous words or deportment , should be carefully restrained ; and delicacy and reserve studiously cherished . It is a common notion , that it is important to secure these virtues to one sex more than to the other ; and , by a strange inconsistency , the sex most exposed to danger , is the one selected as least needing care . But a wise mother will be especially careful that her sons are trained to modesty and purity of mind . But few mothers are sufficiently aware of the dreadful penalties that often result from indulged impurity of thought . If children , in future life , can be preserved from licentious associates , it is supposed that their safety is secured . But the records of our insane retreats , and the pages of medical writers , teach , that even in solitude , and without being aware of the sin or the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfrequently terminate in disease , delirium , and death . Every mother and every teacher , therefore , carefully avoiding all explanation of the mystery , should teach the young , that the indulgence of impure thoughts and actions is visited by the most awful and terrific penalties . Disclosing the details of vice , in order 20  | to awaken dread of its penalties , is a most dangerous experiment , and often leads to the very evils feared . The safest course , is , to cultivate habits of modesty and delicacy , and to teach that all impure thoughts , words , and actions , are forbidden by God , and are often visited by the most dreadful punishment . At the same time , it is important for mothers to protect the young mind from false notions of delicacy . It should be shown , that whatever is necessary , to save from suffering or danger , must be met , without shame or aversion and that all which God has instituted , is wise and right and pure . It is in reference to these dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those highly-wrought fictions , which lead the imagination astray ; and especially from that class of licentious works , made interesting by genius and taste , which have flooded this Country , and which are often found on the parlor table , even of moral and Christian people . Of this class , the writings of Bulwer stand conspicuous . The only difference , between some of his works and the obscene prints , for vending which men suffer the penalties of law , is , that the last are so gross , as to revolt the taste and startle the mind to resistance , while Bulwer presents the same ideas so clothed in the fascinations of taste and genius , as most insidiously to seduce the unwary . It seems to be the chief aim of this licentious writer , to make thieves , murderers , and adulterers appear beautiful , refined , talented , and interesting . It is time that all virtuous persons in the community should rise in indignation , not only against the writers , but the venders of such poison . In conducting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out , as desirable , with reference to their physical well-being . Very recently , the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education addressed letters  | to three of the most distinguished medical men in this Country , requesting their opinion as to the number of hours in which children under eight years of age might safely be kept at school . They were unanimous in limiting the time to four hours devoted to school employments that tax the mind . And this period , they maintain , should not be continuous , but divided by long recesses , so that no child should be confined to one pursuit , for more than half an hour at a time . Of the six hours usually devoted to school , then , two should be given to exercise and sports , and only four to the duties of school . It is very important , to the comfort of most mothers , that their children should be removed from their care , during the six hours of school . And there are many advantages in subjecting young children to the discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other children , of their own age . If , then , a parent can secure a suitable teacher , it is no matter how early they are sent to school , provided their health is not endangered by confinement and mental stimulus . But a decided effort is demanded , to change the customs of schools , so that two thirds of the time shall be allowed for relaxation and sports . And the vigor of mind , and physical comfort , thus secured , would make children learn even faster than by the ordinary method .  | ON THE CARE OF THE SICK . Women frequently called upon to direct in Cases of Indisposition . Extremes to be avoided . Grand Cause of most Diseases , Excess in Eating and Drinking . Fasting useful . Want of Reflection and Good Sense displayed by Many , in dosing . Pernicious Results . Necessity of a Woman 's Understanding the Nature and Operation of Common Medicines . Cough Mixtures . Opium . Mucilaginous Mixtures . Calomel . Discretion required . Child bleeding to Death . Sulphur the safest Cathartic in ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good order . Tempting Delicacies injurious in Sickness . Fresh Air absolutely necessary . Frequent Ablutions important . Arrangements to be made beforehand , when practicable , Importance of Cleanliness ; nothing more annoying to the Sick , than a want of it . Necessity of a proper Preparation of Food , for the Sick . Every Woman should strive to prepare herself to be a good Nurse . How to drop Medicines . Physicians ' Directions to be well understood and implicitly followed . Kindness , Patience , and Sympathy , towards the Sick , important . Impositions of Apothecaries . Drugs to be locked up from the Access of Children . SucH is the state of health , in this Nation , that a woman , with the care of a large family , seldom passes a week without being called on to know what shall be done for some one who is indisposed . In this situation , two extremes are to be avoided ; one is , neglecting to do any thing until the person becomes quite sick , the other is , excessive dosing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from long and dangerous illness , if proper attention were paid to the first symptoms ; whereas , by neglect , the case , which at first would yield readily , becomes a long and distressing disease . But the other extreme is much more common , and involves far greater danger . All medical men unite in the declaration , that the grand cause of most diseases , is , excess in eating and drinking , united with too sedentary habits . Without the exercise which aids to throw off redundant matter , through the  | pores of the skin and the lungs , and stimulated by various condiments , an excessive quantity is put into the stomach , when either digestion must fail , or , if all is absorbed , the system becomes too full , and inflammatory attacks follow . For this reason , it is , that most medical men would , in all slight cases of illness , recommend fasting over two meals , that the overloaded system may have a chance to relieve itself . Another chief cause of disease , is , sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus causing inflammation of the throat , lungs , and nostrils . The best remedy for these attacks , is , warm aperient drinks , bathing the feet , and warm covering , to promote perspiration . After such a process , the skin is more susceptible than before , and should be carefully guarded . It is astonishing to see what want of reflection and good sense is displayed , by persons when sick , in pouring doses into the stomach , without knowing anything of their properties , simply because some one tells them it is good for such a complaint . It does not come to mind , that all which goes into the stomach is either dissolved and carried into the blood , or expelled as redundant matter . Thus , when the lungs , for example , are inflamed , doses will be taken , as if under the apparent impression that the cooling or healing article was somehow going to be poured into the lungs , instead of the stomach . In this way , sometimes one article will be taken , calculated to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; or something will be taken , calculated to open the pores , and promote perspiration , just as a person is going to be most exposed to cold . The frequent result of such dosing , is , that the stomach , being loaded with a variety of contradictory principles , is debilitated , and interrupted in its natural operations , and the whole system , and especially the diseased part , sym-  | pathizes in the evil . It is very important , therefore , that a woman should understand something of the nature and operation of the most common articles given in a family , that some discretion may be used , in adapting means to ends , and in avoiding the excessive or the wrong use of them . Most of the cough mixtures contain some narcotic , generally opium , to quiet the irritability of the nervous system , and thus act on the nerves of the lungs and diminish coughing . To this principle , is usually added , something of the nature of ipecac , to promote a slight nausea , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , some cathartic , to remedy the binding tendency of the narcotic principle . Of course , such mixtures should be used sparingly , and with reference to these objects . Opium , in all forms , tends to produce constipation of the bowels . It also powerfully affects the nervous system , and should be used as little as possible . Balsams , and mucilaginous mixtures , such as flaxseed tea , slipperyelm-bark , and the like , are useful , when the membrane of the throat , and the parts connected with it , are affected ; but have little effect , when a cold affects the lungs . Whenever any article is taken , to promote perspiration , the body should be kept very warm . Calomel is a very dangerous medicine ; and should seldom be used , without advice from a physician . Even when prescribed by a medical man , discretion is often needed . The Writer knew a case , where the physician left several small papers of calomel , and told the mother to give them so often , till an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting as a cathartic ; the mother , having no knowledge of the nature of the medicine , kept on giving the powders , till all were used up . The result was , the blood-vessels of the mouth and other parts were so affected , that , after drench-  | ing sheet after sheet with blood , the child actually bled to death . The most common cathartics , used in a family , are rhubarb , salts , castor oil , and calomel . Salts should be given , when the system needs reducing ; and never in a weak and low state of the system . One of the most distinguished practitioners in the Nation , observed to the Writer , that he considered sulphur as the safest cathartic , for family use , in ordinary cases . Dr. Combe remarks , on this subject , " In the natural and healthy state , under a proper system of diet , and with sufficient exercise , the bowels are relieved regularly , once every day . " Habit " is powerful in modifying the result , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious advantage of observing as much regularity , in relieving the system , as in taking our meals . " It is often the case , that soliciting Nature at a regular period , each day , will remedy constipation , without medicine , and induce a regular and healthy state of the bowels . " When , however , as most frequently happens , the constipation arises " " from the absence of all assistance from the abdonninal , and respiratory muscles , the first step to be taken , is , again to solicit their aid ; ? first , by removing all impediments to free respiration , such as stays , waistbands , and belts ; and , secondly , by resorting to such active exercises , as shall call the muscles into full and regular action : " and lastly , " to proportion the quantity of food to the wants of the system , and to the condition of the digestive organs . If we employ these means , systematically and perseveringly , we shall rarely fail in at last restoring the healthy action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we " neglect these modes , " we may go on , for years , adding pill to pill , and dose to dose , without ever attaining the end at which we aim . "  | It is not unfrequently the case , that , when appetite ceases , from some disarrangement of the system , the first effort of friends , is , to seek some tempting delicacy , to stimulate the palate . But a knowledge of the organization of the stomach , would prevent this pernicious practice . The cessation of appetite is ordinarily the signal , that the system is in such a state that food is not needed , and can not be digested . Of course , as there will be little or no gastric juice , what is thus urged into the stomach , can not be properly digested , and disease is increased . In nursing the sick , too much attention can not be given to securing a proper supply of fresh air . The fact , that persons in the debility of sickness can not bear exposure to sudden chills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick-rooms not only warm , but close . But there is nothing , which more contributes to the restoration of a diseased body , than a plentiful supply of the pure air , which is appointed to draw off from the lungs the unhealthful portions of the system . The purer the air , the faster this restoring process is carried on . It should , therefore , be a primary object , to keep a sick-room well ventilated : this can be done , and still keep it warm . A sick person should always be put in a room with an open fireplace , through which the fresh air , from without , gains access , and impure air passes off . At least twice in the twenty-four hours , the patient should be entirely covered in bed , and a window opened in an adjoining room , into which the door of the sick-room opens . No air in a house , can be so pure , as that which comes from without . After this airing , the patient should remain in bed , till the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fire , if need be . Frequent changes of clothing and bedding , are needful in sickness ; as the exhalations from the skin are then more abundant and more noxious .  | Frequent ablutions , also , are very important , and greatly promote the comfort of the patient . If the room be kept warm , and warm water be used , there is not the least danger in performing this operation . If the whole body can not be sponged with water , at least the face , neck , and limbs , should be washed , once or twice a day . It greatly promotes the comfort of the sick , to have their room , and the articles used about them , kept clean and in order . In doing this , care should be used , to avoid bustle , haste , or noise . If , when a person is taken sick , there are indications that the disease will continue several days , the following arrangements are suggested , to secure quiet , neatness , and order . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large box in the room , and let it be filled , once or twice a day . It would be well to have the following articles provided , to keep in the room or adjacent closet , to prevent constant passing to obtain them from without : ? a small teakettle , a saucepan , a large pail of water , for ablutions , and other water , for drink , in a pitcher , a covered porringer , to warm food and drinks , two pint bowls , two tumblers , two cups and saucers , two wine-glasses , two large and two small spoons , a bowl and towel , to use in washing these articles , a supply of white towels , and also of dish towels . A slop bucket should be in an adjacent room or closet , to receive the wash of the room . Whenever medicine or food is given , a clean towel should be spread over the person or bed-clothing , as nothing is more annoying , to a weak stomach , than the stickiness and soiling produced by medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing about a sick-room be kept clean and in order . The fireplace should be often cleansed of ashes and coals , and the carpet or floor be kept neat . All the articles 21  | used should be immediately after washed , and set in a proper place ; and every implement be put in good order . A sick person has nothing to do , but look about , and when everything is neat , quiet , and in order , a feeling of comfort is induced , while disorder , filth , and neglect , are constant objects of annoyance , which , if not complained of , are yet felt . An air of cheerfulness is given to a sick-room , by covering the table and stand with a clean napkin , and placing flowers and fruit on them . Oranges and lemons give an agreeable look and perfume to any apartment . Pains should be taken to keep flies out of a sickroom ; and for this purpose , all articles which attract them should be covered . There is nothing , more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food prepared in a neat and proper manner . It is at such times , that the sense of smell and taste are most susceptible of annoyance ; and defects , that would scarcely be noticed in health , will often seem so revolting , as to take away all appetite . And the sick have so few sources of enjoyment and comfort , that the minds , even of the most rational , will sometimes fix on some article of food , with great earnestness , and when disappointed , by neglect ' or mistake in the preparation , will sometimes feel it so keenly , as to shed tears . Perhaps , too , the disappointment will be enhanced , by a feeling that the nurse has little care and interest for the comfort of her patient . It is very important , therefore , that every woman strive to prepare herself to be a neat , quiet , and skilful nurse ; and especially , that she learn to prepare articles for the sick with care and accuracy . For this purpose , all the articles , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then scalded , that every disagreeable smell and taste may be removed . In boiling articles , great care should be taken , by having a slow fire , and constant stir-  | ring , to prevent the bitter taste acquired by the adherence of the food to the bottom . Articles can seldom he cooked over a blaze , without acquiring a smoky taste ; therefore be sure never to stir anything , that is boiling , over a blaze or smoke . Strain out lumps , through a strainer or small colander , and put the article in a bowl standing in a plate or saucer , and set them on a waiter . Beside them , place the sugar or salt , or other articles to be added ; and first consult the patient as to the quantity , being careful to put in too little , rather than too much . Keep a clean handkerchief , and a clean towel , to present with food , as nausea is often produced by such articles , used when taking medicine , and all appetite is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . When a person is feverish , cooling the pillows , and changing them , is a comfort ; also , sponging the hands with water having a little milk in it . Frequent swabbing the mouth , with a clean rag tied on the end of a stick , is often a great comfort . When a sick person is raised in bed , a shawl should always be thrown over the shoulders ; and , if weak , a chair put behind the pillows . In dropping medicine , first , wet the lip of the vial , to make it run smooth , and always drop it into a teaspoon , first , lest some mistake he made . Be careful to understand the physician 's directions , and to follow them , exactly . Do not yield to the folly of thinking that persons , who have never studied the complicated system of the human body , nor the nature of medicines , are qualified to modify a physician 's advice . If another person is supposed to know better about the case , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , and secure the services of the more competent person . It is always best to write down the directions of the physician , if he does not do it ; and not trust to  | memory . The nurse should be sure she knows how to properly perform all the directions given . The Writer knows the mother of several children , who was nursing a sick infant , and , when the physician directed her to dress a large blister on its chest , she asked , how it was to be done . " With cabbageleaves , as usual , " was the reply . The mother , never having had experience , took large . cabbageleaves , and put them , cold , unbruised , and unwilted , on the raw flesh of the little sufferer . This was done by an educated . woman , and one who would be called a discreet and sensible person . It shows , that every nurse should be sure to learn , exactly , from the physician , the proper mode of obeying his directions . In nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty murmurs and ill-humors . In nursing a child , though it is hard to do so , it is better to secure proper conduct , and the taking of medicine , by penalties , than to allow rebellion and disobedience . The child will suffer much less , in the end , than if it finds that sickness is a preservative from all penalties for disobedience and ill-humor . Many children , of delicate health , are ruined in their disposition and tempers , by the indulgence and false tenderness of those who nurse them . Always sympathize with the sufferings of the sick , and yet strive to induce them to bear pain with patience , fortitude , and submission , to Him who appoints it . In nursing the . sick , offer to read the Bible , at proper times , and use all discreet means to lead their minds to proper thoughts and feelings , on a subject , of all others most appropriate in hours of confinement and suffering . One caution is very important , in regard to medicines . Physicians say that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who need to be carefully watched . Some adulterate  | their medicines ; some mix them in wrong proportions , to make a little more profit ; and some buy old and useless drugs , for a trifle , and sell them for good ones . It is always best to consult your physician , in regard to the selection of an apothecary ; and , if possible , in all cases you should show him the medicines , before using them . Sometimes , mistakes are made , and poisonous articles are sent , instead of the ones ordered . Many medicines , kept by a family , lose all their virtues , after a time , and are of no use . Always put labels on vials of medicine , and very large and distinct ones on dangerous drugs , which should be kept locked up from the access of children . CHAPTER XXII . ON ACCIDENTS AND ANTIDOTES . Medical Aid should be promptly resorted to . Suffocation , from Substances in the ' Throat Common Cuts . Wounds of Arteries , and other severe Cuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Head . Burns . Drowning . Poisons : ? Corrosive Sublimate ; Limekiln , or Coalmine . Hemorrhage of the Lungs , Stomach , or Throat . Bleeding of the Nose . Dangers from Lightning . Mad Dogs . Insects . Local Inflammations . WHEN serious accidents occur , medical aid should be immediately procured . Till that can be done , the following directions may be useful . When a child has any thing in its throat , first try , with the finger , to get the article up . If it is beyond reach , push it down into the stomach , with some elastic stick . If the article be a pin , sharp bone , glass , or other cutting substance , vomiting should be promptly produced . 21*  | If the choking be occasioned by something getting into the windpipe , it is very dangerous ; but a surgeon can usually save life , if immediately applied to . In the case of a common cut , bind the lips of the wound together with rags . If the cut is large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking plaster must be used for the purpose . Sometimes , it is necessary to take a stitch in the skin , on each lip of the wound , and draw them together with a needle and thread . If an artery is cut , it must immediately be tied up , or the person will bleed to death . The blood of an artery spirts out , in regular jets , with the beating of the heart ; and the blood is of a bright red color . Take up the bleeding end of the artery , and hold it ; or tie a string around it , till a surgeon arrives . When the artery can not be found , and in all cases of bad cuts , apply compression ; and , where it can be done , tie a very tight bandage above the wound , if it is below the heart , and below , if the wound is above the heart . Put a stick into the band and twist it as tight as can be borne , till surgical aid is obtained . Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hot spirits , or a decoction of bitter herbs . Sprains are cured , by entire rest from use , and by bathing in warm water or warm whiskey . If a sprained limb is immediately put to rest , and not used , at all , it will heal twice as quick , as if not so treated ; and for want of this rest , what would often prove very slight , in the end result in very bad , sprains . A sprained leg should be kept in a horizontal position , on a bed or sofa . When a leg is broken , tie it to the other leg , to keep it still ; and get a surgeon , if possible , before the limb swells . Bind a broken arm to a piece of shingle , to keep it still . In case of a fall , or blow on the head , causing insensibility , use a mustard paste on the back of the  | neck and pit of the stomach , and apply spirits , with friction . After the circulation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to attempt it before . In case of bad burns , when the skin is taken off , apply an ointment made of linseed oil and limewater in equal quantities ; and cover this with cotton . But never put raw cotton on a burn with the skin off , as is often done . To some skins , cotton is almost poisonous . Sweet oil on cotton is good . For burns when the skin is not taken off , soft soap , or scraped potato , are very alleviating . In case of drowning , the person should be laid upon his right side , with his head a little elevated , and gently inclined forward ; he should as soon as possible be placed in a moderately-warmed bed , or wrapped in blankets to preserve the vital heat which may yet remain . The mouth should be cleared of phlegm , water , or other foreign substance , by carefully introducing the fingers into it . Spirits of hartshorn may be cautiously applied to the nostrils , or rather occasionally held near the nose . The warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by applying a bladder of warm water to the pit of the stomach , bottles of the same , or hot bricks , or bags filled with hot ashes , to the armpits , groins , and soles of the feet . Brisk frictions of the whole body , first with a dry brush , flannel , or the bare hand , and afterwards with cloths wet with spirits of camphor , should be diligently employed . Gentle pressure should be applied , alternately to the breast and belly , and the lungs should be inflated , in imitation of natural respiration . This may be done , by introducing the nose of a bellows into one nostril and closing the other ; or by closing both nostrils , applying the mouth to that of the drowned person , and gently blowing in air ; in either case closing the gullet , by pressure on the throat . The case should not be abandoned too hastily , as hope-  | less ; for resuscitation has taken place , after eight or ten hours persevering use of proper means . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , through ignorance , had recourse to ; such , for example , as the rolling of the body on a barrel , the suspending of it by the heels , the administering of injections of tobacco , or tobacco smoke , &c.; After the person begins to revive , he may take , at short intervals , and in small quantities , wine or spirit and water , diluted spirits of camphor , or Cologne water , &c.; In case of poisoning , from corrosive sublimate , whites of eggs , beaten up with water , should be given . The proportions are ten or twelve eggs , to two quarts of water . Of this mixture , a tumblerful should be administered every two or three minutes , in order to produce voriting . Where eggs can not be obtained , give wheat-flour and water , or milk and water , freely ; if these are not at command , use gum and water , flaxseed tea , slippery-elm tea , or sugar and water ; or , time being precious , if none of these be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of poisoning from arsenic , or any of its preparations , let the individual poisoned drink large quantities of sugared water , of warm , or even of cold , water , or of flaxseed tea , so as to distend the stomach and produce vomiting , if possible , and thereby eject the poison . A mixture of equal quantities of limewater and sugared , water will also prove beneficial . If opium , or any of its preparations has been taken , in poisonous quantities , induce vomiting , without a moment 's unnecessary delay , by giving , in a small quantity of water , ten grains of ipecac , and ten grains of sulphate of zinc or white vitriol , ( the latter of which is the most prompt emetic known , ) and repeating the dose every fifteen minutes , if the desired effect be not produced . The operation may be sometimes expedited , by introducing the fingers into  | the month , or tickling the throat with a feather . If white vitriol can not be obtained , substitute three or four grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The soporific influence of the poison should be counteracted , by keeping the person in motion . After the stomach has been thoroughly emptied , but not previously , give , every five or ten minutes , alternately , a cup of water made acid with vinegar , cream of tartar , or lemon juice , and a cup of coffee , ( without sugar or milk , ) prepared by pouring a pint of boiling water upon a quarter of a pound of ground burnt coffee , letting it stand ten minutes , and then straining it . The drinks should be continued , so long as any danger is to be apprehended . Dashing cold water upon the head and body , and friction of the extremities , with a brush or coarse towel , are useful . If any kind of acid is taken , in too large quantity , give strong pearlash water . If ley , or pearlash , or any alkali , is taken , give vinegar . In case of stupefaction from fumes of charcoal , or suffocation from entering a well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air , on his back ; dash cold water or vinegar , on the head , face , and breast ; rub the body with the same , or spirits of camphor , or Cologne . Apply mustard paste to the pit of the stomach , and use friction to the soles of the feet , the palms of the hands , and the whole length of the back bone . Vinegar and water or lemonade should be given as drink . When the person revives , he should be laid in a warm bed , in a well-ventilated room , and given small quantities of wine and water . Whatever is done must be done promptly and perseveringly . In case of bleeding at the lungs , or stomach , or throat , take a teaspoonful of dry salt , and repeat it often . For bleeding of the nose , pour cold water on the back of the neck , keeping the head elevated . If a person is struck with lightning , throw bucketsfull of cold water on the head and over the body ,  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole body , especially the extremities , and inflation of the lungs . If a person is bitten by a mad dog , or a rattlesnake , sucking the wound , and cutting out the flesh , around the bite , are the immediate preventives . Meantime call medical advice . For bites of insects , spirits of hartshorn , or salt and water , are good . Poultices , kept wet and warm , are good for most cases of local inflammation ; but they must be kept constantly warm , to be useful . CHAPTER XXIII . ON DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS . Indefiniteness of Opinion on this Subject . Every Person needs some Recreation . General Rules . How much Time to be given . What Amusements proper . Those should always be avoided , which cause Pain , or injure the Health , or endanger Life , or interfere with important Duties , or are pernicious in their Tendency . Horse-racing , Circus-riding , Theatres , and Gambling . Dancing , as now conducted , does not conduce to Health of Body or Mind , but the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dancing considered . Ease and Grace of Manners better secured by a System of Calisthenics . The Writer 's Experience . Balls going out of Fashion , among the more refined Circles . Novel-reading . Necessity for Discrimination . Young Persons should be guarded from Novels . Proper Amusements for Young Persons . Cultivation of Flowers and Fruits . Benefits of the Practice . Music . Children enjoy it . Collections of Shells , Plants , Minerals , &c.; Children 's Games and Sports . Parents should join in them . Mechanical Skill of Children to be encouraged . Other Enjoyments . THERE is much indefiniteness of opinion , in many minds , on the subject of amusements , Which needs to be removed . All persons perceive that children , at least , must spend much time in pursuits which are mere amusements . Many persons think that grown people are at liberty to spend some portion of their time in this way ; while others suppose ,  | that all time , spent by mature minds , for mere amusement , is utterly wasted . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind are fully understood , it will be allowed , by all , that every person needs some kind of recreation ; and that , by securing it , the body is strengthened , the mind invigorated , and all our duties more cheerfully and successfully performed . There are general rules for our guidance , on this subject , also . Children , whose bodies are growing fast , and whose nervous system is tender and excitable , need much more amusement , than mature minds ; and any great degree of physical confinement or mental taxation , are dangerous . Persons , also , who have very great duties and cares , or who are subjected to any continuous intellectual or moral excitement , need recreations to secure physical exercise , and to draw off the mind from absorbing interests . But , unfortunately , it is this class of persons , who have least to do with amusement , while the light , gay , and unemployed , seek amusements which are entirely needless , and for which useful occupation would be most beneficial substitutes . In deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement , it surely is clearly our duty to take just so much as , and no more than , is needful to invigorate mind and body , and thus prepare for the serious duties of life . Any protracting of amusement , which induces excessive fatigue , exhausts the mind , or invades the hours of regular repose , can not be allowed to be right , by those , who concede that we are bound to spend every hour usefully , and that , at the last day , we are to give an account of the use of all our time . In deciding which amusements should be selected , and which avoided , the following general rules are binding . In the first place , no amusements , which inflict needless pain , should ever be allowed . All  | tricks , which cause fright or vexation , and all sports , which involve sufferings to animals , should be utterly forbidden . Hunting and fishing , for mere amusement , can never be justified . If a man can convince his children that these are pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounding and killing of animals is sought for arnusernent , his example may not be very injurious . But children , who see grown persons killing or frightening animals , for amusement , receive lessons which tend little towards forming habits of benevolence and tenderness , and much to an opposite result . Another rule , to guide in selecting amusements , is , that we are to choose none which injure the health , endanger life , or interfere with important duties . As the only legitimate object of amusements , is , to promote health , and prepare for more serious duties , of course , selecting what has a directly opposite tendency , can not be justified . A third rule , is , to avoid those amusements , which experience has shown to be so exciting , and connected with so many temptations , as to be pernicious in tendency , both to the individual and to the community . It is on this ground , that horseracing and circus-riding are excluded . Not because there is any thing positively wrong , in having men andhorses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons looking on for the amusement ; but because experience has shown so many evils connected with these amusements , that they should be relinquished . So with theatres . The enacting of characters , and the amusement thus afforded , in itself may be harmless ; and possibly , in certain cases , might be useful : but experience has shown so many evils to result from this source , that it is deemed wrong to patronize it . So with those exciting games of chance , which are employed in gambling . Under the same head , comes dancing , in the esti-  | mation of the great majority of the religious world . Still , there are many intelligent , excellent , and conscientious persons , who hold a contrary opinion . Such maintain , that it is an innocent and healthful amusement , tending to promote ease of manners , cheerfulness , social affection , and health of mind and body ; that evils are involved only in its excess ; and that , like food , study , or religious excitement , it is only wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if serious and intelligent people would strive to regulate , instead of striving to banish , this amusement , much more good would he secured . On the other side , it is objected , not that dancing is a sin , in itself considered , for it was once a part of sacred worship ; not that it would be objectionable , if it were properly regulated ; not that it does not tend , when used in a proper manner , to health of body and mind , to grace of manners and to social enjoyment : all these things are conceded . But it is objected to , on the same ground as horseracing , card-playing , and theatres ; that we are to look at amusements as they are , and not as they might be . Horseracing might be so conducted , as not to involve cruelty , gambling , drunkenness , and every other vice . And so might theatres and cardplaying . And if serious and intelligent persons undertook to patronize these amusements , in order to regulate them , perhaps they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sunk . But serious and intelligent men know , that , with the weak sense of moral obligation in the mass of society , and the imperfect ideas men have of the proper use of amusements , and the little self-control men , or women , or children , practise , such amusements , as a fact , will not be thus regulated . And they believe dancing to be in the same condemnation . As this amusement is actually conducted , it does not tend to produce health of body or mind , but 22  | directly the contrary . If young and old went out to dance together , in the open air , as the French peasants do , it would be a very different sort of amusement , from what is seen , when , in a room furnished with many lights , and filled with guests , both expending the healthful part of the atmosphere , the young collect , in their tightest dresses , to protract a kind of physical exertion , not habitual , for several hours . During this process , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is lass perfectly oxygenized than health requires ; the pores of the skin are excited by heat and exercise ; the stomach is loaded with indigestible articles , and the quiet , needful to digestion , withheld ; the amusement is protracted beyond the usual hour for repose ; and then , when the skin is made the most highly susceptible to damps and miasms , the company pass from a warm room to the cold night air . It is probable , that there is no single thing that can be pointed out , which combines so many injurious particulars , as this amusement , so often defended , as so healthful . Even if parents , who train their children to dance , can keep them from public balls , ( which is seldom the case , ) dancing in private parlors unites the same mischievous influences . As to the claim of social benefits , ? when a dancingparty occupies the centre of parlors , and the music begins , most of the conversation ceases , while the young prepare themselves for future sickness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ease and grace of manners , ? all that is gained , by this practice , can be better secured , by having masters teach the system of Calisthenics , which , in all its parts , embraces a much more perfect system , both of healthful exercise , graceful movement , and pleasing carriage . The Writer was once inclined to the common opinion , that dancing was harmless , and might be  | regulated ; and she allowed a fair trial to be made under her auspices , by its advocates . The result was , a full conviction that the amusement secured no good , which could not be better gained another way ; that it involved the most pernicious evils to health , character , and happiness ; and that those parents were wise , who brought up their children with the full understanding that they were neither to learn nor to practise the art . In the fifteen years , during which she has had the care of young ladies , she has never known any case , where learning this art , and following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either on the habits , the intellect , the feelings , or the health . Those young ladies , who are brought up to less exciting amusements , are uniformly likely to be the most contented and most useful , while those , who enter the path to which this amusement leads , acquire a relish and desire for high excitement , which makes the more steady and quiet pursuits and enjoyments of home comparatively tasteless . This , the Writer believes to be generally the case , though not invariably so ; for there are exceptions to all general rules . In regard to these exciting amusements , so liable to danger and excess , parents are bound to regard the principle involved in the petition , " lead us not into temptation . " Would it not be inconsistent to teach the lisping tongue of childhood this prayer , and then send it to the dancing-master , to acquire a love for an amusement which leads to constant temptations that so few find strength to resist ? It is encouraging , to those who take this view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent portion of the community are coming to a similar result . Twenty-five years ago , in every part of the Nation , the young , as a matter of course , universally practised this amusement . Now , in those parts of the Country , where religion and intel-  | ligence are most extensively diffused , it is almost impossible to get up a ball among the more refined class of the community . The amusement is fast leaving this rank in society , to remain as a resource for those , whose grade of intelligence and refinement does not relish more elevated amusements . Still , as there is great diversity of opinion , among persons of equal worth and intelligence , a spirit of candor and courtesy should be practised , on both sides . The sneer at bigotry and narrowness of views , on one side , and the uncharitable implication of want of piety , or sense , on the other , are equally inbred and unchristian . Truth , on this subject , is best promoted , not by illnatured crimination and rebuke , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness . There is another species of amusement , which a large portion of the religious world have been accustomed to put under the same condemnation as the preceding . This is novel-reading . The indistinctness and difference of opinion on this subject , have arisen from a want of clear and definite distinctions . Now , as it is impossible to define what are novels and what are not , so as to include one class of fictitious writings and exclude every other , it is impossible to lay down any rule respecting them . The discussion , in fact , turns on the use of those works of imagination , which embrace fictitious narrative . That this species of reading is not only lawful , but necessary and useful , is settled by Divine examples in the parables and allegories of Scripture . Of course , the question must be , what kind of fictitious narratives must be avoided , and what allowed . In deciding this , no specific rules can be given ; but it must be a matter to be regulated by the nature and circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw the allurements of taste and genius around vice and crime , should ever be tolerated ;  | and all that tend to give false views of life and duty , should also be banished . Of those which are written for mere amusement , presenting scenes and events that are interesting and exciting , and having no had moral influence , much must depend on character and circumstances . Some minds are torpid and phlegmatic , and need to have the imagination stimulated ; and such would be benefitted by this kind of reading : others have quick and active imaginations , and would be as much injured . Some persons are often so engaged in absorbing interests , that any thing innocent , which for a short time will draw off , the mind , is of the nature of a medicine ; and , in such cases , this kind of reading is useful . There is need , also , that some men should keep a supervision of the current literature of the day , as guardians to warn others of danger . For this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers , to read indiscriminately , than for any other class of persons ; for they are the guardians of the public weal , in matters of literature , and should be prepared to advise parents and young persons of the evils in one direction and the good in another . In doing this , however , they are bound to go on the same principles that regulate physicians , when they visit infected districts , ? using every precaution to prevent injury to themselves ; having as little to do with pernicious exposures , as a benevolent regard to others will allow ; and faithfully employing all the knowledge and opportunities , thus gained , for warning and preserving others . There is much danger , in taking this course , that men will seek the excitement of the imagination , for the mere pleasure it affords , under the plea of preparing to serve the public , when this is neither the aim nor the result . In regard to the use of such works , by the young , as a general rule , they ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phlegmatic tempera-22  | meat , until the solid parts of education are secured , and a taste for more elevated reading acquired . If these stimulating condiments in literature are freely used in youth , in a majority of cases all relish for more solid reading will be destroyed . If parents succeed in securing habits of cheerful and implicit obedience , it will be very easy to regulate this matter , by an express command , that no story book shall ever be read , until the consent of the parent is obtained . It is not unfrequently the case , that advocates for dancing , and the other more exciting amusements , speak as if those , who were more strict in these matters , were aiming to deprive the young of all amusements ; just as if , when card-playing , theatres , and dancing , were cut off , nothing remains but serious and severe duties . Perhaps there has been some just ground of objection to the course often pursued by parents , in neglecting to provide agreea-ble and suitable substitutes , for the amusements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance of safe , healthful , and delightful , amusements , which all parents may secure for their children , can not be maintained . Some of these will here be pointed out . One of the most useful and important , is , the cultivation of flowers and fruits . This , especially for the daughters of a family , is greatly promotive of health and amusement . It is with the hope , that many young ladies , whose habits are now so formed , that they never can be induced to a course of active domestic exercise , while their parents can hire domestics , may yet he led to an employment which will tend to secure health and vigor of constitution , that so much space is given , in this work , to directions for the cultivation of fruits and flowers . It would be a most desirable improvement , if all female schools could be furnished with suitable grounds and instruments for the cultivation of fruits and flowers ,  | and every inducement offered to engage the young ladies in this pursuit . And every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be healthful women , can not take a surer method to secure this end . Let him set apart a portion of his yard and garden , for fruits and flowers , and see that the soil is well prepared and dug over , and all the rest may be committed to the care of the children . These would need to be provided with a light hoe and rake , a dibble or garden trowel , a watering-pot , and means and opportunities for securing seeds , roots , buds , and grafts , all which might be done at a trifling expense . Then , with proper encouragement , and by the aid of such directions as are contained in this work , every man , who has even half an acre , could secure a small Eden around his premises . In pursuing this amusement , children can also be led to acquire many useful habits . Early rising would , in many cases , be thus secured and , if required to keep their walks and borders free from weeds and rubbish , habits of order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be cultivated , by influencing children to share their fruits and flowers with friends and neighbors , as well as to distribute roots and seeds to those who have not the means of procuring them . A woman or a child , by giving seeds and slips and roots to a washerwoman , or a farmer 's boy , thus exciting them to love and cultivate fruits and flowers , awakens a new and refining source of enjoyment in minds , that have few resources , more elevated than mere physical enjoyments . Our Saviour directs , in making feasts , to call , not the rich , who can recompense again , but the poor , who can make no returns . So children should be taught to dispense their , little treasures , not alone to companions and friends , who will probably return similar favors ; but to those who have no means of making any return . If the rich ,  | who acquire a love for the enjoyments of taste , and have the means to gratify it , would aim to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , our Country would soon literally blossom as the rose . If the ladies of a neighborhood would unite small contributions , and send a list of flower-seeds and roots to some respectable and honest florist , who would not be likely to turn them off with trash , they could divide these among themselves , so as to secure an abundant variety , at a very small expense . A bag of flower-seeds , which can be obtained , at wholesale , at the rate of four cents , would abundantly supply a whole neighborhood ; and , by the gathering of seeds in the Autumn , could be perpetuated . Another very elevating and delightful recreation for the young , is found in music . Here , the Writer would protest against the common practice , in wealthy families , of having the daughters learn to play on the piano , whether they have taste and ear for music , or not . No young lady , who can not sing , and has no great fondness for music , does any thing but waste time , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano . But all children can be taught to sing , in early childhood , if the scientific mode of teaching music in schools could be introduced , as it is in Prussia , Germany , and Switzerland . Then , young children could read and sing music , as easily as they can read language ; and might take any tune , dividing themselves into bands , and sing off , at sight , the endless variety of music that is prepared . And if parents of wealth would take pains to have teachers qualified , as they may be at the Boston Academy , and other similar institutions , for this purpose , who shall teach all the young children in the community , much would be done for the happiness and elevation of the rising generation . This is an amusement , which children enjoy in the  | highest degree ; and it is one that they can enjoy both in the dark weather at home , and in fields and visits abroad . Another resource for domestic amusement , is , the collection of shells , plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of cabinets . If intelligent parents would get the simpler works prepared for the young , and study these things , with their children , a taste for such amusements would soon be developed . The Writer has seen young boys , of eight and ten years of age , gathering and cleaning shells from rivers , and collecting plants and mineralogical specimens , with a delight bordering on ecstasy ; and there are few , if any , who , by proper influences , would not find this a source of ceaseless amusement and improvement . Another resource for family amusement , is , the various games that are played by children , and in which the joining of older members of the family is always a great advantage to both parties . All medical men unite in declaring , that nothing is more beneficial to health than hearty laughter ; and surely our benevolent Creator would not have provided risibles , and made it a source of health and enjoyment to use them , and then have made it a sin so to do . There has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be removed . Such commands as forbid , foolish laughing and jesting , " which are not convenient ; " and which forbid all idle words , and vain conversation , can not apply to any thing but what is foolish , vain , and useless . But jokes , laughter , and sports , when used in such a degree as tends only to promote health , social feelings , and happiness , are neither vain , foolish , nor " not convenient . " It is the excess of these things , and not the moderate use of them , that Scripture forbids . The prevailing temper of the mind , should be cheerful , yet serious ; but there are times , when  | relaxation and laughter are proper for all . There is nothing better for this end , than that parents and older persons should join in the sports of childhood . Mature minds can always make such sports more entertaining to children , and can exert a healthful moral influence over their minds ; and , at the same time , can gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many fathers , who could be thus useful and happy with their children , throw away such opportunities , and wear out soul and body in the pursuit of gain or fame ! Another resource for children , is , in the exercise of mechanical skill . Fathers , by providing tools for their boys , and showing them how to make wheelbarrows , carts , sleds , and various other articles , contribute both to the physical , moral , and social , improvement of their children . And in regard to little daughters , much more can be done , in this way , than many would imagine . The Writer , blessed with the example of a most ingenious and industrious mother , had not only learned , before the age of twelve , to make dolls , of various sorts and sizes , but to cut and fit and sew every article that belongs to a doll 's wardrobe . This , which was for mere amusement , secured such a facility in mechanical pursuits , that , ever afterward , the cutting and fitting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished with entire ease . When a little girl first begins to sew , her mother can promise her a small bed and pillows , as soon as she has sewed a patch quilt for them and then a bedstead , as soon as she has sewed the sheets and cases for pillows ; and then a large doll to dress , as soon as she has made the under garments ; and thus go on , tiH the whole baby-house is earned by the needle and skill of its little owner . Thus , the task of learning to sew will become a pleasure ; and every new toy will be earned by useful exertion . A little  | girl can be taught , by the aid of patterns prepared for the purpose , to cut and fit all articles for her doll . She can also be provided with a little wash-tub , and irons , to wash and iron , and thus keep in proper order a complete little domestic establishment . Besides these amusements , there are the enjoyments secured in walking , riding , visiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children , if trained to be healthful and industrious , will never fail to discover resources for amusement ; while their guardians should lend their aid to guide and restrain them from excess . CHAPTER XXIV . ON SOCIAL DUTIES . Social Enjoyments not always considered in the List of Duties . Main Object of Life to form Character . Kindness to Strangers . Hospitality . Change of Character of Communities in Relation to Hospitality . Resolving large Communities into small Circles . Hospitality should be prompt . Strangers should be made to feel at their ease . Family Friendship should be preserved . Plan adopted by Families of the Writer 's Acquaintance . IT is not unfrequently the case , that the social enjoyments of life , with many , are never placed in the list of duties . Many men allow their professional employments , and many mothers the cares of their families , to occupy their whole time , and never imagine , when they confess their neglect of visiting , writing letters , and the various modes of social hospitality , that they are confessing omissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to make money , and secure those various gratifications of appetite and taste which money purchases , such a course might , to some extent , be justified . But , if  | the main object of life , for ourselves and for others , is to form character , then the neglect of appropriate means to develope the social , domestic , and benevolent , feelings , must be regarded in a very different light . In this view of the subject , every man and every woman are under obligation to devote some portion of time to perpetuating and increasing family and neighborhood friendships , and to sustaining the various claims of domestic hospitality . There is no social duty , which the Supreme Lawgiver has more strenuously urged , than hospitality and kindness to strangers . The widow , the fatherless , and the stranger , are classed together , as the special objects of Divine tenderness ; and the neglect of their feelings and interests is viewed with particular displeasure . There are some reasons , why this duty peculiarly demands attention from the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so frequent and sudden , and the habits of the people are so migratory , that there are strangers in every part of the Country , many of whom have been suddenly bereft of wonted comforts , and are pining , in a strange land , without friends , and without the sympathy and society so necessary to sustain the spirits . Such , too frequently , pass along unnoticed , and with no comforter but Him who " knoweth the heart of a stranger . " In a new country , where visitors are few , and in those states where residences are on dissevered plantations , a generous hospitality may thrive , more as the result of personal wants , than as the offspring of benevolent principle . It is when population becomes so dense , that men feel no such personal wants , that the sacred name and claims of " the stranger " are most likely to be neglected . And those , who on this subject are accustomed to act on principles of Christian benevolence , rather than from impulse , are most likely to fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that communities , which , in their earliest history , were most remarkable for a free and ever ready hospitality , as the rush of population pours in , pass to the opposite extreme . They find that the habits of attention to the stranger , which existed in a limited circle , can not be extended to all who make this claim ; and , finding themselves too severely taxed , instead of modifying , they give up , almost entirely , the practice of this duty . The increase of population in a community , often involves another evil , in the multiplication of a large circle of acquaintances , so that , keeping up any degree of intimacy with all , makes burdensome demands upon time . It is probable , that , in most large places , the visiting circle of each family is far too large to secure the most useful and agreeable mode of social enjoyment . The only remedy for this evil , is , attempting to resolve a large community into small circles . A few families , united by similarity of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship , which can never be secured by the not uncommon method of keeping up " a calling acquaintance , " with some forty or fifty families , and occasionally making a large party to entertain them all . Such a subdivision of society , as the one suggested , can not suddenly be effected ; but , if systematically aimed at , it can eventually be secured . The Writer has been in circles , where this object was effected , and witnessed most delightful results . The parents mingled in unrestrained modes , with the easy cordiality of affectionate friends ; the children of the families thus associated , grew up together , more like brothers and sisters , than like common acquaintances ; while the joys and sorrows of each family were shared by a common sympathy . When a community is thus subdivided , the claims 23  | of the stranger are much more likely to be properly regarded . A person , entering any one of these minor circles , is much more likely to be met by that kind of attention and kindness which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitable responsibility ; whereas , strangers , having claims only on the community , in general , are very apt to find that they are met by no one in particular . It is impossible , in large communities , to carry out the practice of each one paying civilities to every stranger . But it is the duty of all to learn whether such attentions are bestowed ; and , in cases where there is any neglect , to supply the deficiency . If a stranger is allowed to remain in a place , day after day , and week after week , unnoticed and unknown , there must be a great want of correct views and feelings in regard to the duty of hospitality . And it should ever be remembered , that the first days of a stranger 's sojourn are the most dreary ; and that procrastinating hospitable attentions , often destroys half their value . A person who intends to offer civility to a stranger , doubles the kindness , by conferring it at an early period . In social gatherings , the claims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is handsome , or rich , or distinguished by other adventitious advantages , there is no want of proffered civilities or affable discourse ; but a stranger , possessing no such advantages , may often pass a whole evening in society , claiming to be the best , and meet scarcely a word or an act of politeness . When a community learn to act from principle , and not from mere feeling , in this matter , then the mere fact that a person has the claims of a stranger , will ever secure kindness and polite attentions . The most agreeable hospitality , to strangers who become inmates of a family , is that which puts them entirely at ease . This can never be done , when the  | guest perceives that the order of family arrangements is altered , and that time , comfort , and convenience are sacrificed . Offering the best to the stranger , a polite regard to every wish expressed , and giving precedence in all matters of comfort and convenience , can still be combined with the easy freedom which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of hospitable entertainment . It is to be feared , that , in this migratory and business Nation , there is far too little attention given to the preservation of family friendships . There can be no friends , like those reared by the same parents , who have enjoyed together the pleasures of childhood and youth . And yet , such friends scatter abroad , and , taking little or no pains to preserve any social intercourse , they soon become almost as strangers ; and some of the dearest ties of life are suffered to untwine , for want of a little care . If a very little of the time and money spent for the luxuries of food , dress , and furniture , were devoted to perpetuating family friendships , how much more elevated and purer enjoyments would be secured ! There are families , who make it a definite object of effort to perpetuate the ties of kindred by frequent personal intercourse and correspondence , and who secure the means for doing this , by economizing in other less important particulars . Such will testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purest enjoyments of this life . A practice , which , in some cases , has been adopted by the scattered members of a large family , may be worthy of imitation . The method is this . The first day of each month some member of each family , at the two extreme points of dispersion , take a folio sheet , and , filling a part of one page , send it on , by mail , to the next family , who , after reading it , add another contribution , and retail it to the next . Thus the family circular passes from  | each extreme , through , to all the members of a large and widely dispersed family ; and each member becomes a sharer in the joys and sorrows , plans , pursuits , and hopes , of all the rest . At the same time , frequent family meetings are sought ; and the expense , thus incurred , is cheerfully met by retrenchments in other directions . The sacrifice of tea and coffee , or of some other useless physical indulgence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind , a thousand times more elevating and delightful . CHAPTER XXV . ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSES . Importance to Family Comfort of well-constructed Houses . Rules for constructing them . Often disregarded . When . Economy of Labor . Large Houses . Arrangement of Rooms . Staircases . Wells and Cisterns . Ornaments and Furniture . Economy of Money . Shape and Arrangement of Houses . Porticos , Piazzas , and other Ornaments . Simplicity to be preferred . Fireplaces . Economy of Health . Outdoor Conveniences . Doors and Windows . Ventilation . Economy of Comfort . Domestics . Spare Chambers . Good Taste , Proportions . Color and Ornaments . PLANS Or HOUSES AND DOMESTIC CONVENIENCES . Receipts for Whitewash . THERE is no matter of domestic economy , which more seriously involves the health and daily comfort of American women , than the proper construction of houses . There are five particulars , to which attention should be given , in building a house ; namely , economy of labor , economy of money , economy of health , economy of comfort , and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which these rules may be disregarded . The first , respects economy of labor . In deciding upon the size and style of a house , the probabilities  | in regard to hired service , and the health and capacity of the housekeeper , should be the very first consideration . If a man has a reasonable assurance of an income that will enable hirn to hire the service which a large house demands , and if he is in those sections of the country where money will secure competent domestics , it is proper to build a large house and live in a style suitable to it . But if a man is uncertain as to his means , or if qualified domestics are scarce , it is poor economy to build a large house . Every room added to a house increases the amount of sweeping , dusting , - cleaning of floor , paint , and windows , and the expense and care of the furniture pertaining to it . A house of half the size , requires only just half the labor to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great disregard of economy , in this particular , in this Country . Multitudes are living in houses so large , as to demand an amount of service which the means of the owners can not supply ; so that the extra rooms must either be neglected , or the labor must fall on the housekeeper herself . The arrangement of rooms , and the proper supply of conveniences , is another item , in which the economy of labor and comfort are often violated . A great amount of labor is saved , by having rooms and conveniences so arranged , as to avoid walking and carrying . To exhibit these points , more distinctly , some minutiae will be pointed out , where the rules of economy , in regard to labor and comfort , are violated . A front entry and staircase , in most houses , occupy a large space , above and below , and are so open to inspection , as to demand daily care , while a back staircase is added for more common uses . This creates the expense involved in building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order T the 23*  | front one occupying the most conspicuous position , and demanding much space . But a house can be so arranged , that one staircase shall answer all the purposes of two , and save much , both in space , expense , and labor . This will be shown in the engravings on subsequent pages . ( See Fig. 11 , &c.); Another violation of economy of labor , may be seen in the position of kitchens . Nothing is more laborious , to a woman of delicate health , than the care of her kitchen , when access to it is gained only by going down one or two flights of stairs . And yet , how often is it the case , that the mother 's nursery is in the second story , and her kitchen in the basement ! This , in cities , seems to be inevitable ; but it is very needless in the country , where land enough can be secured for extending the circuit of a house . A house should be so arranged , that the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is without domestics , can have access to her nursery and kitchen , with the fewest steps and least effort . Another particular , in which economy in labor is neglected , is in the position of wells and cisterns , and in the methods of drawing the water . These can be so placed , that , by simply turning a cock , or working a small pump , the water will flow directly into the place where it is needed for use . This will be illustrated in the engravings on subsequent pages . But how often is it the case , that wells and cisterns are located out of doors , and at a distance from the place where the water is to be used ; while the mode of drawing and carrying it is excessively laborious ! To draw and carry a couple of pails of water , will often demand an amount of muscular energy , which would be equal to an hour of additional exertion in common modes , if this needless wear and tear were subtracted .  | A want of economy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and furniture , of a house , such as brasses demanding labor , in place of other materials demanding little or none ; filigree ornaments to the casings and mantelpieces ; kitchen floors without paint or oil-cloth , which double the labor in keeping them in order ; and many other items of this sort . A want of economy in money is often seen in the shape and arrangement of houses . A perfect square encloses more rooms , at a less expense , than any other shape ; white it has least surface exposed to external cold , and is most easily warmed and ventilated . And the further a house departs from this shape , the more is the expense increased , both as to construction and methods of warming it in cold weather . Wings and kitchens built out , behind , add to the expense of a building , and require more fuel to warm them . Piazzas and porticos are very expensive appendages , and would secure far more comfort , if turned into additional accommodations , such as closets , drawers , shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest kind of portico , would pay for enlarging the house , so as to admit another room of convenient size . In the subsequent engravings , it will be shown how all the advantages of a portico or piazza may be secured , for a much less sum than is ordinarily bestowed on these expensive appendages. iiuch money is often worse than wasted in finical ornaments about porticos , doors , windows , and fireplaces , Which , to the eye of taste , really diminish , rather than increase , the beauty of appearance . Ornaments are not suitable for any but large and expensive houses , and even in these , it is every year becoming more fashionable to have simple mouldings and carvings , and but little ornamental filigree work . A want of economy is sometimes shown , in the  | position of fireplaces . When a chimney is in the outer wall of a house , one fourth of the heat passes off , through the wall , and is lost . When the chimney is in the centre , all the heat generated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A house , so constructed that a stove can be placed in a central room , surrounded by other rooms , can be warmed with less fuel than by any other contrivance . Some of the plans subsequently given , will illustrate this . In regard to the economy of health , it will be allowed , that , considering the cost of medicine , attendance of physicians , loss of labor , and the interruption of domestic plans , nothing is so expensive as sickness . Every arrangement , therefore , which tends to injure the health , is a serious violation of economy . It sacrifices not only health , but also comfort , time , and money . There is much had economy , in this respect , in constructing houses . One of the most pernicious instances , is found in the position of wells and privies , so that persons in the perspiration of labor , or in the debility of ill health , are obliged to go out of doors , in all weathers . Many an invalid has been thrown back upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , has been made sick , by this cause . In a subsequent engraving , ( Fig. 28 , page 294 , ) the proper arrangement and position of these conveniences is exhibited . Another cause of sickness , is furnished by outside doors opening into sitting-rooms ; an arrangement very common at the South and West . In such cases , children , and persons in delicate health , are very liable to suffer from sudden chills . The warmth of a fire , or the exercise of labor or sport , induces a perspiration . In this state , the door is thrown open , whatever be the temperature abroad ; and the frequent result is , fever , bowel complaints , or the many other evils which follow from a sudden chill , when  | the body is in a state of perspiration . This arrangement , which is so agreeable in warm weather , can be secured without risk , by having a small entry for the outer door , and the windows made long , down to the floor , the lower part on hinges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Winter , and opened only in temperate weather . Another point , where economy of health is neglected , is , in regard to the construction and ventilation of sleeping-rooms . The family , especially children and domestics , are often placed in small chambers , without fireplaces , and with no contrivance for the proper ventilation of the room . Thus they have only a small quantity of air provided for the hours of slumber ; and , before morning , it has been inhaled and expired , until it is loaded with the noxious effluvia from the lungs , and almost deprived of its vital principle . In this way , by a slow , but certain , process , the constitution of childhood and youth is gradually undermined , and life shortened . Every chamber , if not large and airy in dimensions , should have a current of air made to pass through it , by an opening over the door and by a chimney . This will keep up a constant supply of fresh air . When this can not be secured , a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the window , while the bed should be placed out of the immediate current of air . A disregard of economy of comfort , is sometimes seen in the provisions made for the convenience of domestics . A woman , who has large and airy parlors , with a dark and comfortless kitchen , and a small ill-furnished room for her domestics , will often be left to much labor and perplexity , which she would never have felt , had she taken pains to make her house comfortable to her domestics , as well as to herself and her company . There are persons , so wise and economical , as to  | select the largest and pleasantest rooms in the house for common use , while those designed only for occasional occupancy , though genteel and comfortable , are selected from those parts least desirable . Spare chambers , and spare parlors , are generally used in the evening , when position makes little difference in the enjoyment of visiters , while the enjoyment of a family , through every hour of the day , depends , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But multitudes of persons will cramp their bedrooms , kitchens , and closets , to secure a large parlor and spare chamber , to be shut up most of the time , and opened only for transient visiters . This is poor economy of comfort . The construction of houses with reference to taste , is a desirable , though the least important , item . It is not realized , by persons who have not attended to the subject , how much the beauty of a house depends on propriety of proportions . It is always the case , that a house in good proportions is as cheap as , and generally cheaper than , one in which the rules of taste are violated ; and such a house always pleases the eye , even of one unacquainted with the rules of proportion . So the color and ornaments of a house , when properly adapted to its situation , style , and use , have much influence in producing a pleasing effect . PLANS OF HOUSES AND DOMESTIC CONVENIENCES . The following plans are drawn on the assumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes it peculiarly important that dwellinghouses be constructed with reference to economy of labor . There will always be persons , who can build large houses , and find means to secure the service , which a corresponding style of living demands . But any person , who takes general views of the present tendencies of things in this Country , must be convinced , that those who demand hired service , will .  | every year increase , while the relative number of properly-qualified domestics will constantly decrease . The housekeepers in this Nation , to a , very wide extent , must either depend on the service of foreigners , who must be both taught and superintended , or mothers and daughters must themselves perform most of the domestic labor . Either alternative demands , that , in constructing a house , the first object of attention should be , economy of labor . The plans in this work are chiefly designed for persons of moderate circumstances , especially for young housekeepers , who are making their first essays in domestic affairs . In the three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Country are called , suddenly , and , in a great majority of cases , without suitable preparation , to superintend or to perform all the various business of domestic economy ; to nurse children , to manage domestics , to entertain company , to attend the sick , and to multiplied other domestic cares . At the same time , so large a portion of them have delicate health , and suffer so much from the discouragement and depression consequent on disease and the accumulation of harassing cares , that every man , in forming plans for a future residence , ought to make these probabilities the first consideration . And every woman , who has any influence in deciding questions of this sort , ought to regard these liabilities as the foundation of her plans . Especially is this needful , in those newer portions of this Nation , where qualified domestics are most rare . The plan exhibited on the accompanying engravings , ( Fig. 10 , and 11 , ) is , that of a cottage , which will accommodate six grown persons , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . The elevation , or outside front view , ( Fig. 10 , ) is drawn in fine proportions , which is its chief beauty ; and it should be painted white .  | plan of the interior of the same building . The central part ( or porch , a ) projects just enough to afford an entrance to the two adjacent rooms . This is to avoid having an outer door in any family sitting-room , the evils of which have been pointed out . The front , or side windows , or figure  | both , might be made down to the floor , the lower part opening like doors . These could be made tight in Winter , and be opened in Summer . This house has a parlor , eating-room , and kitchen , of convenient size for a family of six or eight . The parlor , b , has the closet , f and the bedpress , k , adjoining it . figure Fig. 12 , represents the doors on that side of the room . The large central doors open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left into the closet , f , and those on the right into the kitchen , j . When these large doors are closed , the room looks like a common parlor , with folding-doors opening into another parlor , as is common in most city houses . This makes it a genteel room for receiving company . When these large doors are thrown open , the room becomes a spacious and airy bedroom ; while the two closets , j ' , f , furnish accommodations for concealing all pertaining to a bedroom that can not appropriately appear in a parlor . The bedpress is just large enough to receive a bed ; and  | under it can be placed a trucklebed for young children . Thus , the mother can have her parlor , nursery , and kitchen , all under her eye at once . The dining-room , c , ( Fig. 11 , ) has the small bedroom , d , adjoining it , large enough for a bed , washstand , bureau , and chair . Leaving the door open , at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , j , has a smaller bedroom , d , attached to it . This will contain a narrow single bed for a domestic . If it be necessary to find accommodations there for two persons , a narrow trucklebed can be put under the single bed . The pantry is at g , and store closet , at h . The chimney is in the middle , thus economizing fuel . The staircase , is designed to give access to the garret , above , and the cellar , below ; one door being at e , and the other at z . A plan for back accommodations is shown in Fig. 28 , ( see page 293 . ) These should be placed in the rear of the kitchen . In a plan on so limited a scale , some economy and contrivance will be demanded , in storing away articles of dress and bedclothing . For this end , in the bedpress ( k ) of the parlor , b , ( Fig. 11 , ) a wide shelf may be placed about two feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above in front of it . On this shelf , Winter bedding and clothing can be stowed , and the curtain will protect them from dust . Under this shelf , at the foot of the bed , pegs can be placed , to hold garments . From the edge of the shelf , above , a curtain can be suspended , to conceal these articles , and protect them from dust . This contrivance answers the purpose of a wardrobe , though it is not quite so convenient . One or both of the closets , f f , should be also fitted up with shelves and drawers .  | represents a fireplace and mantelpiece , in a style which corresponds with the doors and other parts of the building . In these plans of rooms , an entire vacancy in a wall or partition represents a door ; a vacancy with a single line across it , represents a window . A X by a door , shows the place where the door should be hung , and the room into which it should swing . The comfort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which the doors are hung . Fig. 14 , 15 , are plans of another cottage , which contains rooms rather more agreeably arranged , having a bedpress attached to each room , and more space for closets . The disadvantage is , that the chimney is not central ; each fireplace having a flue in the side of the house .  | The elevation ( Fig. 14 ) is drawn with a piazza or porch in front , which would probably cost two hundred dollars . For this sum , another story might be added . The two-story house , without a piazza , ( Fig. 16 , 17 , ) could be built for the same sum as this cottage with one . But whoever likes this interior plan better than the preceding one , and prefers to dispense with the piazza , can put the front of the first cottage to this plan . The only alteration required , would be , to make the windows down to the floor , in order to preserve uniformity with the door , which is to be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In place of the projection for an entry , the slight projection of the width of one brick would preserve the same general appearance on the outside . The folding doors and side doors shown in Fig. 12 , are designed only for a room intended to be used for company . They give a genteel look and symmetry to a room , but cost more . In this cottage , ( Fig. ' 150 they may be put in the front room , and more common doors in the two back ones . In the front room , at z , a door is not needed ; a false one is put there ta ? secure the beauty of symmetry . The bedpresses should all be fitted up with shelves , pegs , and curtains , as previously described . Windows are put in the bedpresses , in order to secure proper ventilation . They ought to be left open , every morning , to air the bedclothing . The window , opening from the entry , b , to the bedpress , g , is designed simply for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 , are designed for a family where most of the domestic labor is to be performed by the ladies of the family . In Fig. 16 , the parlor , c , is designed for a sitting-room , and for company . The room d , is designed partly for an eating-room , and partly for a kitchen . Adjacent to it , is the room g , where , at y and o may be placed an oven and large boiler , or a small fireplace . In this room , the washing , baking , and sink-work may be done ; so as to withdraw all the most soiling employments from the room d . This room may be furnished with a carpet , having a wide oil-cloth around the fireplace . Here most of the cooking for figure  | ordinary meals , and the ironing can be done , and yet the room be made agreeable for an eating-room . The fumes of cooking can be removed by a tempt , - rary current of fresh air ; and they will be no greater III than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant kitchen . The nursery is in the second story , at f ( Fig. 17 , ) with the small adjoining room , g , for young children . The nursery , and also the back chamber , have a fireplace , both of which may be needed in case of sickness . The elevation , Fig. 22 , is designed for the exterior of this plan . Fig. 18 , 19 , are plans of a two-story house , on a larger scale . It has three convenient rooms on the ground story , and four chambers above . The lettering and explanation on the drawing make further description needless . This plan can have either of the elevations , Fig. 20 , or 21 , for its exterior . In this plan , a concealed staircase is made to serve for front and back use . Fig .. 20 , 21 , are other plans , for a larger house , which also can have either of the elevations , Fig. 22 or 23 , adapted to it . The two parlors , c e , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or one of them can be taken for a nursery . In this latter case , the two closets , i i , will be very convenient . The room d , is for an eating-room , and the closets , and storeroom , are placed between that and the kitchen , f . It is a great convenience to have the dish-closet between the dining-room and kitchen ; and if a small stone or marble sink be placed here , it will also be a great convenience . Small cupboards and drawers should be placed in this closet , for table linen and articles that need to be locked up . This is an example of the position of a staircase which is concealed from public view , and answers for both front and back stairs . At p , is a place for hanging overgarments out of sight .
