Stimulus may not be enough <P> To speed the lagging world recovery , the Carter Administration has consistently urged Japan and Germany to stimulate their economies so that they would buy more from other nations . The Germans have so far balked , but at the London economic summit in May , Japanese Premier Takeo Fukuda pledged to do what he could . His early measures were mild and ineffective ; for example , unemployment has risen to 2.1% of the work force-low by U.S. standards , but the second highest rate in Japan since World War II . <P> Last week Fukuda announced a much bigger , $7.6 billion program of spending and loans , mostly for housing , superhighways , express trains , local transportation and sewer systems . To lower unemployment , Fukuda proposes retraining laid-off workers and granting as yet unspecified hiring incentives to employers . In addition , the nation 's central bank would lower interest rates slightly to encourage business spending . All that , said Fukuda , should boost the annual growth rate to 6.7% by next spring , from 5.9% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcies , now running at 1,500 a month . <P> Japanese businessmen generally viewed the program as still too little , too late . Noting that the plan must be approved by the Japanese Diet , Hirokichi Yoshiyama , president of Hitachi Ltd. , said , " Its effect will not be visible " until the end of the fiscal year next March . Washington policymakers were more generous . One Treasury official described the plan as a " kick in the back " that will propel the non-Communist world 's second largest economy forward . Said he with a sigh : " Now if we could only get the Germans to reflate as well . "
