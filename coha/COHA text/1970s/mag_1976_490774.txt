THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONLY the most dedicated student of foreign affairs can hope to keep track of the hot , bloody little wars that have plagued the world in the last decades . But to the extent that the rest of us manage to regulate our confusion we usually do it by classifying events under the headings of familiar abstractions : self-determination versus imperialism , Communism versus Capitalism , Russian power versus American power , class versus class  --  modern concepts to describe situations that we see as the legacy of modern history . Occasionally , however , this perception of messy local performers playing to the beat of big , modern words is pierced by a note so ancient , so resonant of eras we think of as belonging to the dead and innocent past , that we are jolted , as out of a trance . Christians and Moslems , the newscaster says , have been killing each other in Beirut today ; he goes on to explain that both sides are influenced in their actions by a United Nations debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major Angolan factions on " our side " have only an uneasy alliance , because they belong to and represent different tribes ; we read on to learn of the effect of the Angolan situation on Soviet-American relations . For some reason , we are not distracted by the solemn reverberations of international debate and negotiation . For some reason , we do n't try to fit the information into the familiar abstractions . And , as a result , we hear something that is usually lost to us in the general din . We have heard and read the actual words many times , of course , but now their naked meaning penetrates intact . Christians and Moslems . Tribes . A counterpoint to those larger themes we have been straining so hard to follow comes through to us . Christians and Moslems . Protestants and Catholics . Jews and Arabs . Greeks and Turks . Tribes . Tribes . Tribes . The revelation these moments yield is that the most enduring cause of the organized violence we call war is not ideology or greed or politics but the potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that rivalries of this kind have a life of their own , independent of the particular issues that may bring them to the surface at a given moment ; and that insofar as this independence exists , the violence is ritualistic rather than a means to a specific end  --  sometimes the ritualistic reenactment of a history of reciprocal antagonism stretching back for centuries . The revelation does not invalidate other interpretations of the causes of violence . It merely lets us see that very often the point at which tribal antagonisms overlap other causes is the point at which the flame is kindled that drives ordinary men to risk their own lives en masse in order to kill other ordinary men . Americans are inclined to forget the primacy of tribal affiliation , and hence to underestimate its inspirational power . We preferred to see the situation in Vietnam , for example , as a struggle between advocates of different forms of government , and were certain that arms , manpower , and money would alter the dynamics of what was actually a war of tribal passion drawing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even more resistant when the spirit of kinship exerts its pull on our own attitudes ; the educated , forward-looking people of the New ? Vorld , we feel , should be free from such irrational fixations , such ghosts of the past . Thus , we strain to come up with " reasons " for our loyalty to Israel , and to distinguish that loyalty from our involvement in Vietnam , arriving at such flimsy explanations as that Israel is a " real democracy " ? as though if Israel instituted a different form of government we would feel free to abandon her . The trite reason we arc loyal to Israel  --  and the reason our involvement with her is different from that with Vietnam  --  may be that Israel is a member of our extended family , of our tribe , and not only this but a member whose existence symbolizes the family 's sole hope of redemption from one of the most terrible episodes in its own internal history , the Holocaust . Yet because the loyalty , put in these terms , seems irrational ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same bracket as Greeks who shoot Turks and Catholics who bomb Protestants  --  because , in other words , to accept this allegiance as valid seems to entail blotting out a sense of the humanity of the Arabs  --  we try to ignore the persuasion of our instincts . The result , for many of us , is a sense of hopelessness and incapacitation in our efforts to arrive at a tenable , morally sound position on the Middle East . Perhaps part of the explanation of our tendency both to underestimate the force of kinship in people we are not involved with and to resist it in ourselves when we are involved is that we see only its evil effects , and not the original validity of the bonds from which the force arises . Here the conservative tradition may offer some help in a liberal 's frustration . Edmund Burke wrote , " To be attached to the subdivision , to love the little platoon we belong to is the first principle ( the germ as it were of public affections . " It is that spontaneous impulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables us to cultivate societies in the first place . It is that impulse which brings out the best in human beings as well as the worst . The reason it is so hard to achieve peace in ritualistic tribal conflicts is not just that the evil power of hatred is so great but also that the persuasion of love  --  whether it he a patriotic affection or a racial , religious , or cultural bond  --  is so powerful . When we do recognize the local spirit of kinship which underlies so much of the violence in the world , many of us see only a primitive , blinding , and destructive force that must be sterilized by rationality , so that a global spirit of kinship may put an end to all war . Recoiling from the spectacle of the excesses that the local ties give rise to , we fail to see that the same impulse that is the basic unit of war is also the source of the sense of connectedness between men , the basic unit of peace . The paradox posed by the dual character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one can start by asking questions . Is it true that to recognize as valid the pull of kinship within one 's fraternity is necessarily to arrive at an inflexible position of insensitivity toward people outside one 's fraternity ? Is it not possible that that recognition can be a point of departure from which , having understood and accepted the primacy of such attachments , we will he able to control the excesses to which they can lead , while using the impulse in its best manifestations to build an architecture of peace which is solid because it is consistent with human nature ? Since it is unlikely that all the peoples of the world will ever feel toward each other an equal kinship  --  since there will always be gradations of fellowship  --  do we further the sense of the interconnectedness of all people by undervaluing in others and repressing in ourselves the original impulse of kinship on the small scale ? ? ? Found ONjust about any given weekday at P.S. 41 , an institution of lower learning on West Eleventh Street , a fair number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small , round adhesive stickers of various colors attached to their cheeks , their noses , their throats , their earlobes , and their clothing . By lunchtime , when the P.S. 41 smart set breaks for a quick bite at Ray 's Pizza , across the street from the school , the stickers have disappeared . As nearly as we can tell , the stickers have been lost in the reading circle , or else have simply come unstuck and been tossed away . This little fad  --  we hesitate to call it a trend , he-cause it is still confined largely to P.S. 41 ? was begun quietly last summer by an off-season P.S. 41-er called Danny . Perhaps to ease the midsummer ennui , Danny started inspecting pay telephones in the Village for any spare change that might he left around . At some point , he noticed that somebody was putting nickel-size paper stickers on the sides of telephones and of phone booths . The stickers were blue , green , brown , gray , orange ( occasionally the orange had faded to something like peach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out any use for them , he and his friends began to collect them . The telephone stickers quickly became the new objets trouves utter-ly dispensable one moment , utterly indispensable the next , then utterly dispensable again . A few days ago , we accompanied some of Danny 's friends on a sticker harvest . Our guides were a fifth grader called Kate , a fourth grader called Jill , and Jill 's brother Stephen , who is in the first grade . These three live near Washington Square , conveniently close to the pay-telephone thickets of Sixth Avenue . Our first stop was a phone booth at Macdougal Street and Waverly Place , where Stephen spotted a blue sticker . He removed this and attached it to his right wrist . Down the block , toward Sixth Avenue , Kate and Jill each claimed a blue . " It must be a blue day , " Stephen announced . Jill put her sticker on her throat , Kate stuck hers to her chin . Stephen led us a block south and then uptown , and within ten minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones on Sixth Avenue between Washington Place and Twelfth Street . Here and there , someone struck a real bonanza  --  an orange , a green , and a brown all in the same phone booth , say  --  and Stephen proved that he is n't too bashful to barge into an occupied booth to retrieve such treasure . This sort of thing , in fact , is what makes collecting the colored ( lots fun . None of the three knew where the stickers came from , and they said they preferred not to have the mystery solved . Kate told us , " We figure it 's just some weirdo sticking these things all over the phones . " Close  --  it 's Charles Podgurski . Thanks to Mr. Podgurski , who is the director of maintenance for the New York Telephone Company , and a man who takes his work seriously , we can report these findings : The stickers belong to a phone-maintenance system that Mr. P. thought up three years ago . There are thirty-six thousand pay phones in Manhattan , about a third of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like grocery stores and cafeterias , and that the owner of the premises is responsible for reporting equipment failure . Another twelve thousand or so are situated in low-density spots  --  say , the kitchen of a restaurant  --  and require only sporadic maintenance checks . Of the remaining twelve thousand  --  the pay phones on sidewalks , in office-building lobbies , in department stores  --  each is inspected every day by one of Mr. Podgurski 's subordinates , Each repairman checks from a hundred and fifty to two hundred phones , and , to show that he 's been there , he puts a sticker on the telephone or on the phone booth . The maintenance men use blue stickers on Monday , brown on Tuesday , green on Wednesday , orange on Thursday , gray on Friday . When the foreman comes around later on , he can see , by the presence or absence of stickers , how far along his route the repairman has gone . Hitches develop here and there when sticker affixers ca n't work faster than sticker removers . " If the stickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " Mr. Podgurski explained to us . " Fortunately , we have n't seen much of a pattern of removal . If I had any real problem , I 'd be taking my foremen to task and my foremen would be taking the repairmen to task . These kids tend to hit the same four or five phones again and again . " Mr. Podgurski seems to lean toward the " one - or- two- per- cent- l unaticfringe " theory  --  a concept that , it is generally agreed , was originally developed by the residents of Isla Vista , California , after some rowdies firebombed a branch of the Bank of America there back during the college-campus d:sorders . When this theory is applied to pay telephones , it dictates that ninety-eight or ninety-nine per cent of the phones in New York City are safe from the clutches of the sticker collectors . All this reminds us of other significant useless objects that people have collected over the years  --  gum wrappers , pop-tops from aluminum cans , empty ink cartridges from fountain pens , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red cellophane strips were n't pure cal-lectors ' items , because some people believed that anyone who collected a hundred pounds of them  --  or maybe it was a ton  --  could redeem them for a pony . So far , no one has promised anything about telephone stickers and ponies . The final tally the other day , before everyone adjourned to a candy store near P.S. 41 , was : four blues , two oranges , and one gray for Kate ; five blues , three oranges , two grays , and one green for Jill ; four blues , four grays , two oranges , and one-half brown for Stephen . An hour later , the three had thrown everything away . Super Sunday VERYBODY I know writes our I : friend the fellow-citizen has been talking all this week about " Mary Hartman , Mary Hartman , " and that is interesting , because I 've still got a few words left for Super Bowl X , which everybody I know pronounced " X " and not " Ten , " going on to make jokes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't stopped talking about for the preceding two weeks . Not that I have anything against " Mary 2 , " as they are calling it in Variety  --  you know , Norman Lear 's freeze-dried Chekhov , his near-soap-opera in which everyone is completely dippy , and which stars Woody Allen 's ex-wife , Louise Lasser  --  except that it has no laugh track , and I think comedies are more friendly with laugh tracks . Laugh and the TV laughs with you is what I say . But the Super Bowl is the only television party of the year where everybody anybody knows goes over to somebody 's house for a few hours just to sit and eat and watch the same TV program . Always friendly . The World Series is not the same , because it has to he at least four games , so there are always some people who are not there . Channel 11 here in New York does traditionally broadcast three or four hours of a film of a log burning on a couple of andirons on Christmas Eve , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fireplace for three or four hours every Christmas Eve , but the log is no smaller at eleven or twelve than it was at nine , so the whole show is instant replay . People have shut up about the Super Bowl because they psyched it out . They all got excited before Super Bowls like VIII and IX , and then the games were nothing much and they were disappointed and had something to talk about . So this year they all talked about how dull X was going to be , and about an article in TV Guide which said that a professor had clocked VIII with his stopwatch and discovered that the ball was actually in motion for only seven minutes . So then X , which pitted the wild-card Dallas Cowboys against the reigning-champ Pittsburgh Steelers , turned out to be a fine game , or three-quarters of a fine game . The third period was a little slow , with no scoring , as Dallas sat on a three-point lead , but it was a game that Dallas could still have won after Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the game clock . So Monday everybody said " Good game " to everybody else and started talking about " Mary Hartman ! ' Of course , I mean in New York City . They may still be huddled around the steel forges in Pittsburgh or huddled around the airport in Dallas-Fort Worth talking over old times and replaying the game in their memories . I went over to an environmental-planning teacher 's house for X. His party was ten guys and one wife , a dental assistant who is trying to learn to like football . There were an assistant D.A. , a market researcher , a sportswriter , an occult-book salesman , etc. ? you know , the usual New York mix . The TV set was a twelve-inch Sony Trinitron , which the teacher , who ca n't get cable , has hooked up to an omnidirectional antenna , which has two metal circles that rotate on different axes as well as rabbit ears . He gets good reception , There were two Dallas fans in the room the usual New York mix . We all ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half the half where Dallas assumed the lead  --  and said whatever came into our heads about what we were seeing . One guy was a play-byplayer . He yelled out , " He got it ! He dropped it ! They got it -- ooh , and THEY got it back ! " One of the two Dallas fans gave a play-by-play of his own emotional state : " I 'm a very confident Dallas fan now . I do n't believe it ! Stinko ! I 'm not confident any28 FEBRUARY 2 , 19 7 G more . It 's still anybody 's ballgame . Halm ! No , what 's he doing ? Pittsburgh fan : " Falling down . " I 've lost . I 'm dejected ! " Other people talked to the commercials . A commercial showed a Ford pickup truck from the movie " Mr. Majestyk . " The truck , which was bounding around all over the screen over rough terrain , got everybody thinking about what football would be like if it was played in pickup trucks . The backfield could drive sportier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Another discussion topic : What happens if when you kick off you miss the ball completely ? No one knew the answer . The sportswriter said you were supposed to fall down . At halftime , the teacher brought out Super Bowl fodder : hot dogs cooked in the new Pillsbury Wiener Wraps they 've been advertising on TV . It 's a roll of dough perforated like postage stamps , and you tear off a piece and wrap it around a hot dog and bake it on a greased cookie sheet at 375 ? for thirteen to sixteen minutes . The label says , " FOR NUTRITION INFORMATION WRITE : CO THE PILLSBURY COMPANY . " Pretty good with mustard and with kosher pickles left over from New Year 's Eve . Then they showed film clips of the glory days of the Green Bay Packers while Barbra Streisand sang " The Way We Were , " and all present shut up , because they all had goose bumps in spite of themselves , as they all said when the song was over . Nothing like an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time . Then came the third period , of no scoring , and the fourth period , when Pittsburgh , after a blocked punt , won and Dallas almost won . And I bought two pints of Jamoca Almond Fudge , two pints of Pralines and Cream , and a pint of Banana Rocky Road at Baskin-Robbins , and they threw in a jar of cold Hot Fudge as part of their thirtyfirst-anniversary celebration . " Good party , " said the wife , who still does n't like football . " See you at XI . " Aspects of Revolution THE other day , we went to the twelfth National Fashion and Boutique Show , at the Hotel McAlpin , and then directly to the convention of the National Retail Merchants Association , which was being held twenty blocks north , at the New York Hilton . Going immediately from the one to the other gave us the impression that the more life changes the more it does n't remain the same  --  at least in the realm of fashion . Five years ago , we went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was sponsored , like this latest one , by Larkin Publica tions , publishers of Boutique Fashions Magazine . The big word used then to describe the exhibitors , who were mostly young and mostly wearing hot pants , was " revolutionary . " Other very popular words , used for the names of the then **27;5161;TOOLONG exhibitors , were " funky , " " groovy , " and " hip " : Funky by Dexter , Groovy Headwear , Hip Products , etc . This time around ? Right . No " revolution . " No " funky , " no " groovy , " and no " hip . " Not a single exhibitor listed in the Boutique Show directory under such names . But plenty of names striking an upbeat , cheerful , prosperous note : A. Smile , Inc. ; Above the Belt , Inc. ; Alaskan Silver &; Ivory Co. ; Beautiful Jools , Inc. ; BonHomme Shirtmakers , Ltd. ; Bottoms Up Jeans ; Buck-L-Up ; C'est Moi ; Courageous Clothes , Ltd. ; David King Buckles of Distinction ; El Toro Bravo ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , It 's Me ! by Marguerite ; Joy Optical Co. ; Liberty Country Wear , Inc. ; Liberty Tree ; Liberty Trouser Co. ; Made in Paradise ; Oui Oui ; Sing &; Smile ; Well Made Pants Co. , Inc. ; Sunny Daze Shoe Co. ; Blue Sky Leather ; Superior Pants Co. ; Faded Glory by Appendagez ; and Hutspah Shirts . A kind of restless satisfaction was in the air at the show . Not a whiff of pot . Not a single pair of hot pants . The exhibitors still looked fairly young , and were carefully dressed to look poor and casual in denim and in leather , but were clearly on the flabby side . Not a wild eye in the place . " Very funny thing  --  you are looking at what is now the backbone of the industry , " said Alan Larkin , one of the sponsors of the show . ( His co-sponsors were his brother Harold and a man named Oscar Pluznick , who is also president of the show . ) Alan Larkin looked younger than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gray sideburns , and exuding confidence , suntan , relaxation , and profit . " What 's happened ? " we asked used to talk revolution , and now they talk success , " Mr. Larkin said , with a little , devil-may-care smile and a wave of the hand . " Five years ago , all you saw here was bare feet . Now you see shoes . With heels . With socks . The head-shop scene is over . As the young people got older , the market moved up with them . To its dismay , it found out that middle-aged people have more money to spend than the very young . These manufacturers are now catering to them . The war in Vietnam ended . Poof ! All the beards disappeared . We 've got a few mustaches left , that 's all . Our show is so big now we 've had to set up a seniority system . It takes three years to get into it , and we 've got a waiting list . We 've grown from giving two shows a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , two in Los Angeles . You know who 's waiting to get in What used to he called the estabEshment . Now they are eager to change . " " For example ? " we asked . " Take El Toro Bravo , " Mr. Larkin said , with another little smile . " El Toro Bravo is a fifty-year-old firm . Pants , jeans , knit shirts , T-shirts , leather , suede , rainwear  --  everything . They used to be M. Rubin &; Sons , and they made work clothes . Take A. Smile . A successful jeans house . People used to call jeans dungarees . Take Landlubber . They 're M. Hoffman &; Co. , Inc. , who started making work clothes in 1919 under the name of Dubbleware . Sturdy , sturdy overalls and work shirts . Then they started making jeans and matching tops , and now they 've dispensed with their entire work-clothes line . That 's the way it goes . " " Who 's buying all this stuff ? " we asked . " What is the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave us an immediate answer . " The fella who still has to wear a suit , shirt , and tie to the office but gets into jeans and the leather jacket the minute he gets home , " he said . " What would you say is the underlying theme of this show ? " we asked , and this time Mr. Larkin delegated one of his many assistants , a young man named Robert Gelles , to answer . " The natural approach in styling , fabrication , and color , " Mr. Gelles answered instantly . " The casual image . " " Who 's more popular here ? " we asked . " The new manufacturers or the old ones who have joined up ? " " Both , " Mr. Gelles answered , again instantly . " Everyone here wants to he near Faded Glory , a trend-setter in faded jeans . Faded Glory is a fairly new company that used to be in the wig business . They switched over when they started buying Army and Navy surplus stuff and started making recycled jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies do about twenty-five million dollars a year . Both get about a million in retail orders at this show . " " What 's one big item here ? " we asked . " Transfer T-shirts , " Mr. Genes said , " And the transfer-T-shirt machine . One model sells for seven hundred and another for five hundred and fifty . A young man can buy one and start a whole business with it . It was co-invented by Alex Feather and Bob Cohen , who used to be one of the largest footwear manufacturers in the East . They got bored and went out to California , where they started PhotoLith , the company that makes the machine . Debbie Reynolds helps out with their public relations . " We wandered around the show for a while and were filled in on various patterns that the boutique revolution had developed . A young man named Stewart Richer  --  wearing Army-surplus drawstring pants , a collarless shirt circa 1920 , and 0/of Daughters boots  --  who was in charge of the Rossett Manufacturing Corp . exhibit of hats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( For four dollars . Wholesale . ) " I just sold eleven thousand dollars in hat orders to a store in Sweden ! " Mr. Richer , who is sturdy-looking and has a classic , all-American-boy , pink-checked , young-entrepreneur face , told us . " I used to have a candle factory . Remember when candles were big ? When they went from twenty-five million dollars to seventy-five million overnight ? Then , in 1973 , candles petered out . Hats are coming back big now . And drawstrings . I was the first to sell these drawstrings . In my own shop , Reminiscence , at 175 Macdougal Street . Now everybody 's selling drawstrings . Can you imagine a Swedish store buying eleven thousand dollars ' worth of hats ? " Next , we ran into a chic couple named Fil ( for Filmore ) and Angie ( for Angelia ) Griggs , of The Village Fox , a store in Little Rock , Arkansas , and they told us they had just spent about thirty-five thousand dollars buy-        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
