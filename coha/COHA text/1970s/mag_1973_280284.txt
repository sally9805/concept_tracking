THE HEARINGS/COVER STORY <P> Now the grave charges against the President had passed a point of no return . Carried with chilling reality into millions of American homes and spread massively on the official record of a solemn Senate inquiry , the torrential testimony of John W. Dean III fell short of proof in a court of law . But the impact was devastating . As President , Richard Nixon was grievously , if not mortally wounded . <P> Nixon was a continent away at San Clemente , going about the business of the presidency . He reached a historic compromise with Congress on halting the Cambodia bombing by Aug. 15 ( see page 14 ) . He prepared to celebrate the nation 's 197th Independence Day , a Fourth of July dimmed by deeply troubling questions ( in the words of the Declaration ) about the " just powers " of the present Government and by increasing doubts about the " consent of the governed . " Though not present in the packed hearing room , Nixon was personally and directly confronted by the crouched figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Leaning into the microphone , Dean , 34 , spoke in a lifeless monotone that would long be remembered by TV audiences . There were just enough unexpected angles and lines in his face , including a slightly crooked grin , to rescue it from mediocrity . Thanks to a pair of glasses , he looked more owlish than his earlier , boyish pictures had suggested . With impressive poise and a masterly memory , Dean spun his detailed web of evidence . He readily admitted his own illegal and improper acts . But he emerged unshaken from five full days of recital and crossexamination , with his basic story challenged but intact . <P> Clearly , without some kind of direct and detailed Nixon reply , the committee-and the country-would have difficulty believing that the President was not an active and fully aware participant in the Watergate coverup , as Dean charged . In fact , how and when the President would reply became a decisive factor in his hopes for political survival . Chairman Sam Ervin and other committee members had already begun to ask for his appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some documents , Dean had similarly implicated Nixon 's most intimate former aides , John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman , in multiple actions in the Watergate coverup . Less vigorously but still deeply , Dean had also drawn into that circle of conspirators a man he much admires , former Attorney General John Mitchell . <P> Focusing Blame . While Nixon 's deputy press secretary quickly revealed that the President had no intention of submitting himself to senatorial questioning , a White House counterstrategy seemed to be emerging . It was to blame Dean and Mitchell for the Watergate wiretapping and its concealment . Ehrlichman and Haldeman will likely take the blame for shielding the clandestine activities of the White House team of agents- " the plumbers " - but plead that these were separate from Watergate and necessary in the interests of national security . <P> The focusing of blame on Mitchell triggered speculation that he might become angry enough to lash back at the entire White House . But his attorney said last week that Mitchell will not implicate the President when he becomes the next Ervin committee witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon last year even after
