To civil rights advocates , the decision of the New York State Board of Regents came as a bitter surprise . Once in the forefront of the drive for school desegregation , the board announced recently that it will no longer consider the racial balance in enrollment to determine if a school is in compliance with state integration laws . Instead , the regents will henceforth require New York schools only to make a " serious effort " to desegregate . The decision , black Regent Kenneth Clark said bluntly , was " a tragic retreat . " <P> Such retreats have become almost commonplace in the North . While only 25% of black pupils in the South are still attending largely black schools , the percentage in the North is still 49% . The movement for Northern school desegregation has become mired down somewhere between interminable court delays in Los Angeles , uneasy anticipation in Detroit and outright racial violence in Boston . In most large Northern cities , it seems , the pressure for desegregation has been significantly relaxed . <P> In Detroit , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , wants the $200,000 earmarked by the school board for busing plans to be used instead to improve the schools , particularly in the area of vocational training . Young also opposes busing on the pragmatic ground that the reaction would make South Boston " look like a warmup . " Still , Detroit , which has a 70% black enrollment , may face busing next fall . Last summer the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Detroit plan to merge the city and suburban schools , and ordered the school board to come up with another plan . <P> Even court orders do not bring rapid integration . Although San Francisco schools have been under court order to desegregate since 1971 , 43 of the city 's 96 elementary schools have still not met the court 's standards . Another California court ordered the Los Angeles schools to desegregate five years ago , but the issue has been under appeal ever since . Says School Board Member Georgina Hardy : " Basically , there 's no real desire on the part of anyone-black , white or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for desegregation has also come virtually to a stop in Chicago , where the school enrollment is already 70% minority . Chicago school officials are reluctant to do anything that will make the remaining whites move away , and many blacks support their inaction . <P> One-Way Busing . In Boston 's bitter school battle , 16 different proposals have so far been submitted in response to U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity 's order for citywide desegregation next fall . The plan that has the most substantial support would require suburbs with declining enrollments and empty school seats to take students from Boston . Such a plan-involving voluntary , one-way busing-was introduced in the Massachusetts legislature last month ; it has the backing of new Governor Michael Dukakis and Boston Mayor Kevin White . It would involve relatively small numbers of students and would not significantly change the racial balance of Boston-area schools .
