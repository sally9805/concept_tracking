PAT &; DEBBY : SHARING THE LIMELIGHT , SPREADING THE WORD After several stormy years , harmony prevails at the Boone family residence . Performing solo , in tandem , or en masse , Pat and company are making beautiful music together , onstage and off . by Paul Baker It has been something like 25 years and 45 million records since Charles Eugene " Pat " Boone made his first hit record , entitled " Two Hearts , Two Kisses . " Pat and his wife Shirley were living in Texas , where he was earning $44.50 a week at a Fort Worth TV station . He had to borrow the money to make it to Chicago , where the song was recorded . Now in their mid-40 's , Pat and Shirley Boone are not only parents of four daughters in their mid-20 's , but they are also grandparents twice . For several years , entertainment has been a family affair for the Boones , all of whom joined Pat in 1969 for a concert tour of Japan . The audiences loved the family show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vegas . In addition , they recorded several albums of music and appeared on numerous television specials . In 1976 , the four Boone sisters  --  Cherry , Lindy , Debby , and Laury  --  recorded the first of their own albums on their father 's label , Lamb &; Lion Records . Their second one , entitled First Class , received a nomination for a Grammy Award for best performance in an Inspirational category . In 1977 it had also been Debby 's lot to be the first of the four daughters to shine in her own right as a star , when she recorded the tremendously successful song " You Light Up My Life . " Within a few weeks after its release , Debby 's recording virtually eclipsed any of Pat 's more than 50 hits . " You Light Up My Life , " whichultimately sold more than 31/2 million copies , remained at the #1 position on pop music charts for ten straight weeks , a feat unmatched by anyone else in the previous 22 years , the Beatles and Elvis included . Debby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ultimately led to new career opportunities in acting , including a television acting role in " Gift of the Magi " this past Christmas and a Las Vegas show in late January . " I never dreamed , " Pat reminisced recently , " that I would bring my family into my live performing and into my television work . When we started out I felt weshould keep our family separate and let the girls have as normal ' an upbringing and childhood as possible . " I enjoyed bringing them on television once every few years and showing them off , " he continued . " Any dad does ! But then , it was ' Back home , girls . Back to school . ' However , normal teen-age existence in school life changed dramatically , so I felt that they would be exposed to worse things at home than with me on the road . Who would have ever dreamed that ? The girls , as they entered their teens , and even before , were exposed to the temptations of drugs , sex , occult religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was always glad to load everybody up on the plane and take them with me rather than leave them at home . " Pat and Shirley discovered very quickly that there was no way to isolate their girls from corrupting influences , especially those in an entertainment environment . At first , they tried to isolate the girls by sending them to private schools . " But , " recalls Pat , " we found that we could n't ever run away from things that were happening all around us  --  in other people 's houses , in other families , and in the streets ; we could n't protect them from what was happening in the newspapers , magazines , and on television . There was no such thing as isolation . " We discovered , though , that there 's insulation , which is valid no matter where they are , and no matter what the environment , the school , or the economic background . Insulation is a living , vital , vertical relationship with God . One to one . " The most priceless thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " is encourage a relationship between God and the child . That will tend to work wonders in the family unit , in the child 's personal life , and among the child 's friends . We 've seen that with our children , at least . " Pat 's heavy hand of authority over his daughters , with his rigid rules , restrictions , and protectiveness , has always been a popular target of the sensationalist press . His reputation as an archaically strait-laced character drew an unending barrage of good-natured jabs as well as downright derision . Raising children with such a strict hand was pass ? to many parents , too demanding on the parents if nothing else . The spanking rod had been put away in the closet ever since Dr. Spock had written his famous book on child care . In the mid-1960 's , however , the gossip columnists had plenty of tasty morsels to chew on when it came to the Boones . Pat 's image as the all-American boy faded as he began living a life style decidedly different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brought him close to professional , financial , marital , and paternal failure . In 1967 new life began for the Boones . First , it was a spiritual renewal for Shirley , who had been near the point of collapse . Not too long after that , Pat experienced a similar renewal , and then each of the girls did likewise . Life in the Boone household changed radically . " Dating from the spiritual turnaround we had , " Pat explains , " the top thing became relationships with God and with each other . " Although Pat remained a protective , strict father , his rules were now tendered with love and sincere desire to raise a Christian family in an environment of love . Their dad was now an ex ample for the girls rather than a hypocrite . Though things had been put back in order at the Boones ' , there were still periods of crisis within the family . One such crisis came when teen-ager Debby found that her friends did n't really fit into the mold her father demanded . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strict curfew that Debby was embarrassed to have . For two years or so , Debby withdrew into a world of her own , rebelling . But , she recalls , she finally found out that what she really wanted was n't to be just like her friends . " I just wanted to find out who I was . I finally relaxed and let the Lord help me discover that , " Debby explains . Although she did n't fully realize it during her rebellious years , Debby 's parents were seeing beneath the rebellion a potential singing ability that they wanted to encourage and bring more to the surface . " Up until the time I recorded You Light Up My Life , ' I had n't done a solo record , " Debby remembers . " My parents had n't felt comfortable about it . There was a struggle going on , of me wanting my own career and also of knowing deep within me that that was what God was going to do with me . My parents were frightened for me , and yet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was all a matter of timing . I always thought I was ready when I was n't , but I knew that the Lord would show me the time through them . And He did ! This was it ! The first time they came to me , saying , ' You should do this song ! ' " " You Light Up My Life " became more than just a hit record for Debby . " At first , " she recalls , " it was just an O.K. song to me . But when I started listening to the words and saw how it really applied to my relationship to the Lord , then the excitement came . For me , it was kind of what the Lord was doing in me while singing it that was so special . " The special feeling that Debby experienced reached her audiences as well . In countless appearances on national and international television programs singing the hit song , the charisma was there . In fact , Debby received hundreds of letters from fans who expressed to her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases that it changed lives . But not all the letters have come from happy people . Debby also receives correspondence from down-and-outers , people in the middle of big problems . They seek her advice . " I have letters that would tear your heart out , " she says . " I want so badly for those kids to have parents like I had  --  parents who love them and never give up by taking the stand that ' times have changed ' and ' we 're being too restrictive by saying no . " I just wish that parents could trust themselves enough that , when they know what 's right for their kids , they do it even though it seems so unfashionable . " I see parents letting their kids dominate them , " Debby adds , " telling them how it should be  --  even when they 're younger , really young . The kids get a little cocky , it starts then ; and that 's when it needs to be dealt with , then continued all the way up until they 're grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , sees the importance of pa-rental authority being exercised . " I know that  --  from the depths of their being  --  they want to be restricted and want to have that security of knowing that their parents are helping them get through their lives , guiding them and leading them . They want to know they ca n't come and go as they please , because they 're afraid of where they 'll end up . " Debby remembers the times when she did n't respond so favorably to her parents ' corrections . " All through my life , " she says , " it was , ' I 'll never do that to my kids . ' But now I know I will ! I can look back and see that some problems have stemmed from an almost ' panicky ' restriction , to the extent that we girls have had fears of things we should n't be afraid of , but I would n't trade with anybody in the world . " As Debby 's mother looks back over nearly 25 years of child-raising , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do , and we 'll always be available to our children for any kind of spiritual counsel . I feel the Holy Spirit leads us to know how to pray for them at times when they 're not even with us , and that will be a constant protection . But we 've really done the core of our job . We 've planted the seed . " Referring to Scripture verses Ephesians 6:4 and Proverbs 22:6 , Shirley adds , " We 've raised them in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord . We can say we 've trained our children in the way they should go , and if they should depart from it for a while , I trust the Spirit of the Lord to draw them back . He did it to us . " Laury , who is the youngest of the Boone sisters and will most likely be the last one to move away from under the Boone roof , comments that " Debby and I and all the girls are just so happy for the way our parents did bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , I might disagree with the way they handled things  --  especially some of the strictness  --  but looking at the results , as opposed to the results of some of my more lenient friends ' households , we know the Lord , and that 's the most important thing . They 've guided us into a spiritual relationship with Jesus . That 's made us stable . " The number of people living in the Boones ' Beverly Hills home is diminishing . Oldest daughter Cherry and her husband Dan O'Neal now live in Hawaii . Daughter Lindy and her husband Doug Corbin have given Mom and Dad their first two grandchildren . The Corbins live close enough , though , to enable little Ryan and even littler Jessica to visit their grandparents occasionally . Debby 's engagement to Gabriel Ferrer , son of actor Jose Ferrer and songstress Rosemary Clooney , was announced late last year . " We now find ourselves in a very unpredictable phase , " says Pat . " Shirley and I are trying to look into the future and figure it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past summer , when we took our first vacation alone together in 16 years ! " Both Pat and Shirley conclude that their Hawaii vacation was a slowing-down time for them , giving Shirley a rest from raising the kids and giving Pat a new perspective on not being involved in so many business and career activities that there is no time to spend with his wife . Anyone who has known the Boones for long knows that their rest is overdue . Pat 's busyness has been incredible over the years . At one time he was involved in more than 30 business ventures , and he admits that practically none of them came to anything . He can now see that the involvement in so many different personal and business activities was like the spinning of a web : As he got more caught up in it , it kept him more and more from precious time with his family . Says Shirley , " We always had to be busy ! And I think when you 're so busy , sometimes you do n't really take time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , deep things that you 're really about . I think it 's a very important part of our relationship that we do n't play games and stay so busy that we do n't have to face the realities of what plateau our lives are at . I think God planned it that way . We need to reexamine our relationships with the Lord every now and then , and we need to do the same thing in our relationships with one another : where we are and where we 're going . " Pat and Shirley see themselves at a crucial time . " We 've got friends that have raised families , " says Pat , " and when their children are just about gone , the husband and wife break up . They find they did n't build enough into their own relationship . They had built their lives around the kids and careers . Now that the career may have set-tled into a manageable situation , and now that the kids are about raised , the husband and wife look at each other and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied . They have n't developed enough common interests apart from family and business . " So , " he continues , " Shirley and I are learning that we have to invest time in ourselves and each other , operate on principles , and the feelings will come out of that . When the new wears off and the differences really begin to loom large , what are you going to do ? Fifty percent of the marriages these days break up . Business partnerships break up . Friendships break up . " We did n't go off to Continued on page 125 Hawaii because we were madly in love and wanted a second honeymoon . We went off to Hawaii because we knew we needed time to rekindle and respark things that were almost dormant . And it works ! Two weeks together , apart from almost every other influence , brought me to a deep new appreciation of Shirley and feelings of romance . And the same with her ! " The Hawaii vacation also showed me that you can take two weeks off and the world wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical shape by jogging daily and frequently working out in the gym . But he plans to " ease off " to some degree on his myriad activities to spend more time with his family , especially Shirley . There 's no doubt that he 's still very active , especially where his singing and entertaining are concerned . He recently completed a new album , entitled Just the Way I Am . His record label continues to operate at full steam . This Easter marks yet another Pat Boone Family television special on ABC . The Boones have also appeared on several other networks in the past few months , including religious television . Daughter Debby is inheriting some of the " Boone busyness " as her career continues to blossom . In late January , she premiered her own Las Vegas show , and she recently completed her third solo album for Warner/Curb Records . Though father Pat pretty well gives Debby free rein in making decisions of which songs to perform on stage and on her albums , you can be sure he 'll be there encouraging her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sisters in the studio to make an album that will be their third . Even though Pat has been in the entertainment business for nearly 25 years , the word " retirement " is still foreign to him . In fact , he says , " I ca n't imagine it . I 'd still like to learn how to work on television sets .... " Shirley comments , " He wants to know everything about every-thing ! " Pat : " And I 've not really yet learned how to play guitar . I 've got to do that . I 've bought two guitars , and .... " Shirley : " He 'd like to fly .... " Pat : " I 've paid for my flying lessons right through the commercial license .... " Shirley : " He 'd like to be able to take a car apart .... " Pat : " ... and I only took a few flying lessons ; I have n't soloed yet .... " They 've just begun planning the next 25 years . r
