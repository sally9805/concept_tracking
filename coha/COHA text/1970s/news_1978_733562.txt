A22 Letters Gasoline Rationing : The Better Import Reducer To the Editor : Your March 27 editorial " Crude Alternatives to the Crude Oil Tax " perpetuates the myth that gasoline rationing would be an " extreme way " of reducing America 's appetite for foreign oil , which , as you correctly state , " jeopardizes the nation 's strategic independence and diminishes the value of the dollar . " Gasoline rationing , despite your knee-jerk reaction that it " would invite political havoc " and almost surely " lead to bribery and black markets , " is a demonstrably more equitable and efficient way of bringing our foreign oil consumption under control than any of the other alternatives you examined , i.e. the crude oil equalization tax ( COET ) , import fees on foreign oil , decontrolling domestic oil prices , or imposing import quotas . Attempting to slow the growth of America 's massive oil imports through cost-escalating taxes , fees , decontrols , or auctioned import quotas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden surge of new inflation , discriminate against the poor , and fail to reduce demand by any predictable amount since people living in our automobile-dependent culture will understandably cut back on their consumption of other necessities In order to buy gasoline for their cars . Rationing , on the other hand , would enable us to reduce petroleum imports very gradually , with considerable precision , and in a way that 's noninflationary // Robert Neubecker Contract Key To the Editor : A suggestion for settling future labor disputes , both public and private : In each instance , average the percentage increase per settlement for a period long enough to provide a meaningful figure  --  say the preceding 10 years . Since experience has demonstrated this figure is what both sides can reasonably expect to agree on , let . them accept the same percentage increase  --  combining wage hikes and benefits ? as the settlement for the next contract agreement . This way the public will be spared the penalties of work interruptions while both parties will gain : wages for labor and income from goods or services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why not try it ? JOHN GUENTHER Rye , N. Y. , March 31 , 1978 and fair to all consumers  --  rich and poor alike . The gradual reduction of gasoline consumption , plus the ability of motorists to buy or sell gasoline coupons on a " white market " similar to the one envisioned by the Department of Energy in its standby rationing program , should keep illegal activities to a minimum . Counterfeiting and the black market were not a problem at the beginning of World War II , for example , when gasoline consumption was cut back by less than 10 percent . They " developed into a serious menace , " according to the O.P.A. 's Ninth Quarterly Report dated March 31 , 1944 , as military ' demands for fuel increased , and as civilian consumption was slashed by 40 percent in just two years . It 's also doubtful it a gasoline rationing program would create any more expensive or cumbersome . bureaucracy than the one already being put into place by the Department of Energy  --  with its 20,000 employees and $10.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " penalties , " " restrictions , " " rebates , " " rewards , " " taxes , " and " tax cuts " enumerated by President . Carter in his April 20 , 1977 , speech on energy policy to a joint session of Congress . The bureaucracy needed to administer a crude oil equalization tax , or import fee program , for example , would obviously have to be extensive To the Editor : Your foreign correspondent praising New York above foreign cities ( April 6 ) recalls a jest which was current in Nazi Germany , about 40 years ago , in which a Swiss citizen Is told about all the wonders of Hitler 's Germany , after which he finally answers : " Well , we have something you do n't have . In our country , when the doorbell rings at five o'clock in the morning , we , know it is the milkman . " Visiting London last month after a lapse of more than five years , I found everything considerably more expensive , including the theater . But walking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting lost in the deserted squares , I could still feel safe . Hearing footsteps in the distance and waiting for them to come nearer , I saw a young girl approaching whom I asked for directions . Neither she nor I was afraid . Is this possible in New York in any neighborhood ? WILLY COHEN New York , April 6 , 1978 To the Editor : Hoorah for Paul Hofmann ( " Foreign Correspondent Back and ' Has a Nice Day ' " ) . As one with 25 years behind me living long periods abroad , and traveling widely on three continents including Europe , the biggest thrill is coming home again to " the Big Apple . " As one almost deprived recently of my New York homeland , now reprieved for the moment , I agree with Paul Hofmann . Where else in today 's inflationary as these charges are to be refunded to the public at large , including , I presume , the approximately 17 percent of all American families that do ' not own cars , along with great numbers of poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Census . To make matters worse , this public rebate money could quickly be diverted into vast new pork barrels so beloved by the Washington political establishment . COET , for instance , has already been discussed in the Congress as a source of funds for the Department of Energy 's emerging synthetic fuels program , estimated to cost between $20 billion and $40 billion . Raising the price of domestic oil to world levels by removing controls would result in windfall profits for producers , as you point out , while restricting imports through a presidentially imposed quota-allocation  --  program would invite manipulation by the powerful oil industry for ? its own financial advantage . Gasoline rationing can cure our excessive appetite for foreign oil fairly and effectively . It can also educate the American people ? as the Administration and Congress have so far utterly failed to do ? that the United States has a serious energy problem , which must be solved if we are to remain militarily and economically secure . CARTER HENDERSON Co-Director , Princeton Center for Alternative Futures Princeton , N. J. , March 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European , Latin American , ' African , Middle Eastern ? as delicious , as cheap , as varied ? Where else are hotels , motels , inns as comfortable , available at such a variety of prices to fit all pocketbooks ? Where else is theater , sport , dance , music , art  --  classic or modern ? as satisfying ? Where else are people as stimulating , as ethnically mixed , as much fun ? Where else is the general life style as refreshing ? Yes , Paul Hofmann , every day Is " a nice day " in New York City . BLYTHE FOOTE FINKS Palisades , N. Y. , April 6 , 1978 Of Doctors and Fees To the Editor : The argument espoused by Dr. Ives ( letter April 3 ) is specious and reflects the concern too often articulated by organized medicine : justification of a median annual income of $63,000 . The writer might do well to address the why of rising malpractice costs , Le. , courts of law finding that the insured practitioners have indeed malpracticed . In plain English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to lessen the rising cost of malpractice insurance . Let 's get on with peer review and other quality-control measures . It 's almost enough to force one to re-evaluate the merits of the fee-forservice system . is n't it ? HELEN MELLETT New York , April 4 , 1978 The writer is a registered nurse . About Life in New York City To Study a Public Takeover of Con Edison To the Editor : Your March 22 editorial which suggested that the Council of Churches of the City of New York was speculating in " heavenly economics " when it passed a resolution calling on the city to conduct a feasibility study on a public takeover of Consolidated Edison fails to take into consideration several facts : ? The council is acting in concert with 25 church , consumer and civic groups , plus labor unions , which have banded together in a citywide coalition called P.O.W.E.R . ( People Outraged With Energy Rates ) . This coalition can provide extensive documentation to show that a publicly owned utility system in the city would reduce everyone 's utility rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people be subsidized would cost the taxpayers far more than the $100,000 to $200,000 tha feasibility study ' would cost the city . Furthermore , the feasibility study would answer in detail the questions of how much the takeover would cost and by how much rates could be reduced . Also , it should be pointed out that since 1970 Con Ed has received at least $1.316 billion in public subsidies . ? Con Ed 's rates and practices not only harass and , yes , sometimes kill the poor of our city , but these rates and practices also cripple our churches and drive business from the city . A 1975 study by the New York State Department of Commerce stated that utility rates were the second most frequently given reason for manufacturing firms ' leaving the city . ? Neither the council nor P.O.W.E.R . Is suggesting that the city buy Con Ed . We are saying , rather , that a public agency , either now existing or one that could be created under New York State law , purchase Con Ed . Over 2,000 publicly owned utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is in Los Angeles . ? The council is saying , along with P.O.W.E.R. , that enough evidence exists to suggest strongly that a publicly owned utility system would greatly alleviate the economic woes not only of the . poor and middle-class citizens of our city but of churches and businesses as well . We are certain that the relatively small expense for a feasibility study should be considered an investment which would undoubtedly reap great economic and humanitarian benefits for our entire city . ( Rev. ) FRANKLIN D. GRAHAM ( Rev. ) ROBERT EMERICK New York , March 27 , 1978 The writers , are , respectively , the Council of Churches ' director of program and the president of P.O.W.E.R . Before the Cutoff To the Editor : I enjoyed your March 22 editorial " The Power of Heavenly Economics . " But one statement in it requires some clarification . The editorial stated that the Public Service Commission had ruled that no utility could cut off ' electric service this winter to any customer who depends on it for heating . The commission did not issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly prohibited . Special procedures were in effect , however , for most of the heating season ; they were adopted voluntarily by the major electric and gas utilities in response to a letter I wrote to them . The procedures included face-to-face contact with the affected customer before disconnection , refraining from termination of service in the event of a potentially unhealthy or unsafe situation , and the referring of such cases to local social service agencies , as well as checking , to the extent feasible , on all residences where service had been disconnected in recent months before the winter and not subsequently reconnected . The major utility companies had already been following some or all of these practices as matters of internal policy . My request for more cautious disconnection procedures was made in light of the tragic deaths in January of two Buffalo residents whose utility services had been cut off last fall . While our staff found that the utilities involved in these cases had complied with all applicable legal requirements , I judged it necessary to take further reasonable steps to try to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with the Department of Social Services and the Office for the Aging to develop formal regulations governing disconnection procedures that will be implemented before the next heating season . Our goal is to identify potential hardship cases , particularly among elderly customers , so that they can be referred to the proper social service agencies for eromet attention . CHARLES A.
