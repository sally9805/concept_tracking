 | Christmas is for children , but over the years I 've discovered that it 's the old fellow in the red suit who has the very best time of all . While parents are running around frantically doing last-minute shopping , and children are chewing their nails worrying whether or not they 'll get that present they want so much , Santa Claus can just sit back and really enjoy the hectic Christmas rush . I ought to know because , for the last ten years , I 've played Santa . That 's how I 've discovered that Christmas is n't for children ? it 's for Santa Claus ! Every Christmas is warm and wonderful for me , but last Christmas was really special because of children like eight-year-old Christy . I 'll never forget the way she jumped into my lap with determination . At her advanced age , a visit with Santa was just routine stuff " Have . you been a good girl this year , Christy ? " I began . " Yes , Santa ; ' she said , giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what would you like from Santa this year ? " I asked in my most impressive , booming Santa voice . Christy squirmed , then settled herself on my knee . " Well ; she said , casting her large eyes toward the ceiling , " I need some candy and , uh , some new socks ... and a pretty dress ... and most of all , I 'd like a walking baby doll ! ' She looked at me with a smile of content . " Ho , ho , ho ; ' I said , bouncing my knee . " I might be able to deliver all of those things , Christy , but you 'll have to be a good girl . Will you promise to try hard ? " Okay , Santa ; ' she said breezily , as she grabbed a candy cane from my sack of goodies and slid down from my knee . She started to walk away , then abruptly turned around and shook her little finger in my direction . " This year , Santa Claus ; ' she warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries for the baby doll . Last year the ones you put under the tree did n't fit the mania doll and I could n't get her to walk until my daddy went to the store and got the right ones ' . ' Millions of children visit Santa every holiday season , yet you can place all those  | youngsters into just four categories . The first group I call the Absolute Believers They are " angels " because they approach me with awe . They rarely say a word , content to stare at me with affection and respect . The best they can do is nod their heads shyly when I ask if they 've been good and therefore deserve the toys and favorite gifts they 've been wishing for and writing Santa about . The next group is the Nonbelievers who need to reassure themselves every year that Santa Claus does n't exist . I know you 're not Santa , " these little devils will say accusingly , " because there is n't one . " Then , they 'll poke me in the stomach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , or they 'll yank at my - beard , trusting that it 's not attached . Between the Absolute Believers and the Nonbelievers are the Undecideds . They 're the " quiz " kids who want so much to believe but have been told by older brothers or sisters that " only babies believe in Santa Claus . " These children devise tests in the hopes of disproving the testimony of a wise-guy big brother " All right , " they 'll say boldly , " if you 're Santa , then name the eight reindeer . " That 's an easy question . Wow , am I convincing when I 'm asked questions like that . But I 've lost a lot of Undecideds to the Nonbeliever category when I 'm asked a question I do n't have an answer for , like : " What did you give me for Christmas last year ? " I 've left the biggest and best category for last . Most children run through a whole , delightful gamut of emotions while sitting on my lap . Their innocence their hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . They are the ones who deliver the true spirit of Christmas to St. Nicholas . I call these children the Charmers . I 'll never forget the Charmers I met when I was invited to entertain childin a Midwestern housing developer . one cool , but not cold , December ever just before Christmas . As I sneaked i the development , which was neatly tee into a frozen valley , I sensed the at : pation that flowed out from under doors of the brightly decorated ho rI knocked at the first home on m and surprised a curly haired , four-s old boy who was pressing his nose age : the window , but could hardly see bey , . the smear of his breath that had for on the glass . Between yells of del he invited me inside and hurried to his mom and dad that a very epee visitor had arrived . In the few seconds it took Ronny return to the living room with his pare he had realized that he was n't dream : that Santa actually was in his ho . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to speak . As clung to his mother and looked me c from boot to cap , I talked with his fa : Within a few minutes , he had moe closer to me . His mother snapped a  | ture of us next to their towering Christmas tree . Ronny , however , never said a single word . As I left , I assured him that I 'd be back on Christmas Eve . I forgot about Ronny upon arriving at the next house on my list where I was greeted by eight-year-old twins , Melissa and Scotty . They reacted so enthusiastically to my arrival that they did n't dare leave the room for fear I might escape . In a flash , each of the twins positioned herself on one of my knees and filled my ears with long lists of what to bring for Christmas . Melissa and Scotty asked if they could be my elves for the evening , and with their parents ' permission they joined me for my next stop . When the other children saw Melissa and Scotty helping Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had six happy and eager elves at my side . Several of the older elves decided it would be fun to hide me in the bushes or behind a tree while they sang Santa Claus Is Corning to Town in front of the homes I still had to visit . Then , while the families watched from their windows and doorways , I was to appear on cue from the shadows . It was a splendid idea that added greatly to the surprise . It was an idea that only a child who loves Christmas could have conceived . By the time I reached my last stop , I was accompanied by a chorus of 12 elves . I orchestrated the singing as we walked along the winding road of their country community . Christmas lights and a bright moon lit our way and snowflakes danced in our path . It was the perfect holiday evening , and I wished it would never end . We had just finished singing Silent Night when I felt a tiny hand reach up into mine . I looked down and saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't recognize . It was the red-cheeked face of a little boy who was so tired by this late hour that he was dragging his clumsy boots . I bent down to wipe his runny nose and to take a closer look . It was Ronny . " I love you , Santa Claus , " he said softly , but firmly . At that moment , I understood the meaning of Christmas . A similar feeling of warmth filled my velvet suit the chilly night I visited six-year-old Joey . Joey had never talked with Santa before , but he knew all about him from his records and from stories that his parents and older brother had told him . When Joey 's mother asked me to visit him the first time , I said I was n't averse to Joey 's searching hands feeling my face and suit . It was Joey 's only way of seeing me , for he had been born blind . When I entered his home , Joey grabbed my hand and cautiously led me to an overstuffed hassock that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sit on . Joey stood before me. almost ceremoniously , and examined mr ; face and the size of my shoulders and paunch . " I can see you . Santa Claus , " he said as his chubby fingers pinched my cheek , and stroked my soft , white beard . " I see your whiskers and your big , red nose . and your red cap with the white ball at the end . " In one quick motion he reached his arms around my wide , black belt and hugged my waist . " Santa , you really are big ! " he exclaimed . Once Joey was convinced that Santa was really in his living room , he proceeded to tell me what to bring him and his whole family for Christmas . I wen : home knowing that at last Joey had seen Santa Claus and I could see tine Santa had given Joey his greatest Christmas gift of all . Joey and Ronny and all the other children , even those devilish Nonbelievers , are the reason Christmas is so precious and gratifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played Santa .
