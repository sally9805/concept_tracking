" What 's a mountain ? " asked George Washington , a twenty-two-year-old black man from the asphalt core of Chicago . Totally blind since birth , George , on his first trip out of the city , had just arrived in mountain-cradled Aspen , Colorado , as a guest of a unique organization called BOLD  --  Blind Outdoor Leisure Development  --  a nonprofit program designed to involve the visually handicapped in active winter and summer sports , from skiing to mountain climbing . George , along with that week 's quota of a dozen blind people aged fourteen to forty-eight , men , women , white , black and Chicano , had been invited to take part in a spirited program of hiking , climbing , riding , swimming , camping , fishing , ice-skating and cultural activities . " You 'll soon find out what a mountain is , " answered retired Army Colonel John Hayes , Director of the Aspen BOLD Club . " And not only will you find out what a mountain is , and a trout is , and a horse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week you 'll forget about what you ca n't do and be amazed at what you can do . " Colonel Hayes , with his corps of volunteer BOLD guides , was on hand to make sure George Washington took the full measure of 11,000-foot Aspen Mountain . George and his blind companions had a choice . They could go by jeep , by horseback , climb on foot or ride the chair lift to the summit . It was on the chair-lift ride up that George experienced for himself what a mountain is . He was giddy with the rarefied high-altitude air , the exciting new sounds and the earthy scents . Pine pitch and mountain hay , the screams of a rogue hawk spooking a camp bird , the barking of sheep-tending dogs and the music of a stream tumbling over boulders . As the chair lift carried him up , up and up , this city-oriented blind man exulted in all the new sensations his body had never known before . At the top , his guide helped him off the lift and he ate his lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a million wild flowers . Then , before the long hike four miles down to the base lodge with his blind friends , George drank from a fern-scented stream , letting the glacial waters pour through his cupped hands . Refreshed , he was guided down the trail over the rough terrain . His leg muscles tingled and his blood raced through his veins . He learned the meaning of height and mountain vastness . " Man , I love these mountains ! " exploded George Washington , as he sank happily exhausted into a sofa back at the lodge . Next day , the blind girl from Rochester who had never even been close to a horse ran her hand over a horse 's head and along its silken flanks before she climbed into the saddle to join her new friends and her guide on a breakfast ride at the T-lazy-7 Ranch . The ride took them through the tall aspen groves , along the surging waters of Maroon Creek , to a campfire in a forest clearing . Roscoe , the camp cook 's pet raccoon , nibbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel a Colorado columbine . Later that same day , on an overnight jeep trip to a high mountaincabin by a lake , totally blind Carol , mother of four , from Milwaukee , said , " If anyone had told me I 'd sit on the bank of a wilderness lake , catch a trout and cook it over a campfire , I 'd have laughed in his face . I ca n't believe what I 've done today  --  it 's all a dream . " Later that evening , Carol and another blind girl insisted on trading sleeping quarters with their two guides . " You men can sleep in the cabin ; we 're going to sleep in your tent . What 's camping if we ca n't sleep out ? " This was the fourth year of the Aspen Blind Outdoor Leisure Development program . Founded in 1970 by a sporting Frenchman named Jean Eymere , BOLD , Inc. , is today a national parent organization with ten regional clubs across the country ( more clubs are in the works ) , all fashioned after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized as a skiing program for the blind , has proven to be a dynamic and exciting rehabilitation tool for the visually handicapped . It has already changed the lives of hundreds of the country 's half million blind people . But it took the personal tragedy , the struggle , and the ultimate triumph of thirty-five-year-old Jean Eymere , a European transplant from the French Alps to the Colorado Rockies , to spark the original BOLD club . Apart from operating his own four-seasons lodge , Jean was a certified Aspen ski instructor and a member of the crack Mountain Rescue Team . One day , in 1969 , he came in off the ski slopes complaining of blurred vision . It had happened before but Jean thought it was temporary " snow blindness " from sunlight that ricocheted with laser intensity off the snow . This time though , there were sharp pains pulsing behind his eyeballs . " I 'm going to give it to you straight , Jean , " the doctor told him later . " You 're going blind . . . totally blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months . We can try surgery  --  but it appears irreversible . " Jean looked out the window at the snow settling on the spruce and could barely see through to the mountains beyond . " Oh my God , " was all he could say . His attractive Dutch-born wife , Wilhelmina , sat by his side . Her usually animated face froze into a mask of shock . This multifaceted , talented man , so full of joie de vivre in the prime of his life , suddenly felt there was no point in living . " All I could think of , " said Jean , recalling this shattering moment , " was that I would never ski again , never climb a mountain , never ride a horse or fish or hunt and of course I would have to sell my lodge . . How could I ever take care of my business and handle my guests ? " But little did Jean know then that someday , through his personal triumph and joyous sense of living , he would do all these things . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of blind people hopelessly trapped in the belief that happiness and a sporting life are not for them . As a young boy growing up in the French Alps , Jean had been a bright and eager student . Until , for no apparent reason , subtle but alarming changes dulled his responses to the point where , sadly , he was placed in a youth camp for retarded children . When he was on the verge of suffering lasting emotional scars , his trouble was finally diagnosed as diabetes . He had gone two years untreated . Only insulin injection and six months in a hospital saved his life . From the time of his hospital release , Jean Eymere programmed himself to succeed . He was ten years old and single-tracked in his determination to become a competitive athlete , and already his artistic talents were emerging . With the ski slopes of Chamonix and Val d'Is  --  re for training grounds , and the art schools of Paris within easy reach , Jean , despite his diabetes , grew up to win a berth on the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arts in Paris . Now , years later , after a stint as a commercial artist and steel engraver in New York City where , among other works , he designed the die for the Kennedy half dollar , Jean and his wife are settled in Aspen . Until that moment when the knowledge of his gathering blindness set him back and demolished his spirit , temporarily , sports and the arts made up the fabric of Jean 's days . Jean hit bottom the day the doctor told him , after a series of painful and futile operations , that there was no hope of his regaining his sight . His long history of diabetes had taken its toll . But it was his wife , Wilhelmina , who was there with the right words , the right mix of compassion and toughness . Wils , as Jean calls her , refused to treat her husband as a handicapped man . " Hey Jean , " she said , " you love dogs and so do I ... We 'll get you a guide dog so you can be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . What about that kitchen of ours  --  it 's impossible to work in . Why do n't you do a remodeling job for me ? " Jean laughed a hollow laugh at her far-out suggestion . " You seem to forget I 'm blind ... I 'm finished . . . How could I even hammer a nail ? " he said . But it was n't long before Wils had her new kitchen , designed and remodeled by her blind husband . For this job Jean used his power saw and an audio level that " bleeps " when it 's not level ( a tool designed specialty for the visually handicapped ) . Recalling his first blind carpentry job , Jean says with a grin , " I learned a few new English words the day I hired a helper with a wooden leg and drove a nail into it by mistake . I never had a helper after that . " But during those first months after Jean came home from the guide-dog school with Chianti , his golden retriever guide dog , he sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competitive by nature , yet gentle and sensitive to artistry , recoiled into his blacked-out world . Day after day he sat dejectedly , with Chianti at his feet . " I could find no solace in taking walks around town with Chianti and getting my kicks secondhand , listening to cassettes and just sitting , sitting , sitting . I lost all hope . The joy was gone , " Jean said , as he thought back to those desolate days . But just as Jean began to think there was nothing ahead for him , an event happened that changed his life , sparked his inner vision and propelled him into action once again . Soon after the ski lifts opened in the winter of 1969.70 , Brian Webber , a skier-employee at Jean 's Coachlight Chalet , burst into the lounge , stomping the snow off his boots . " Come on , Jean , you ca n't just sit there forever  --  let 's go skiing ! " " Skiing ? Are you crazy ? That 's impossible . You know I can never ski again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great misgivings , he booted up and the two headed for the slopes . It was a near disaster . First , Jean 's pride . A former national downhill racer reduced to a groping beginner ? Blind ? On top of that , he had to fight the stresses of balance and vertigo . He got dizzy , actually sick , a common curse for the blind experiencing dynamic motion for the first time . He fell repeatedly and once almost skied head on into a tree . It was terrifying for Brian too . Jean came home after sundown and fell exhausted into his chair by the fire . He did n't say much and Wils did n't probe . But secretly , deep down , he was elated . " Even though it all seemed a little hopeless that first day , I found joy in the struggle . At least I was doing something and that felt good , " Jean said . By the end of a week he was skiing down the slope under control  --  with Brian skiing just behind him , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian , maybe I can ski again ! " From that moment on , Jean shifted into overdrive and started living again . His credo hardened into anew battle cry : can do . " I can ski ... I 'm free ... The sensations are mind-blowing . I can do anything now ... It 's a wild new world , " Jean exploded joyously to Wils , who just let the tears that Jean could n't see stream down her face . Each day brought a new challenge . This thirty-five-year-old blind , diabetic athlete , artist , entrepreneur and bon vivant had rediscovered an action-packed life . In his off-hours , when Jean was n't skiing the mountain with friends , he took up ice-skating for the first time . After only seven lessons and long hours of practice , he passed the U.S. Figure Skating Association tests for pre-dance figures . At the end of that triumphant winter , Jean stored away his skis and skates and looked forward to the challenges that lay ahead when the snow melted and the streams raced through the high country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A time to take his lodge guests backpacking , horseback riding , fishing the wild trout lakes and swimming . Remarkably , this summer was no different for blind Jean Eymere . On the first warm summer day when the Rocky Mountain sun was high and wild flowers colored the alpine meadows , Wits matter-of-factly got out the camping gear and Jean 's fishing rod . Then she harnessed up Chianti and called some friends to join them on the trail . With their friendsthey climbed into Aspen 's wilderness backdrop , fished and cooked Jean 's catch of rainbows over the campfire after dark . " At first I could n't believe it ... There was almost more joy than when I was sighted , " Jean said as he described the scents and sounds of nature that had passed by him before . And Chianti , always by his side , panting and wagging his tail and guiding his blind master into the back country . With his new confidence , other sports followed . He swam , rode horses , tandem-biked with Wils and even tried kayaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guests and creative projects kept Jean busy . He even planted a rock garden by himself , and when Wils found him busily weeding the flowers and cultivating the weeds , she did n't have the heart to stop him . And , with characteristic whimsy , Jean tells the story about the night a friend stopped by his workshop when he was chiseling his marble sculpture of a young girl . " How do you like my work ? " Jean asked . Embarrassed , the friend answered , " Jean , if you would turn on the light in here , maybe I could see what it is you 're working on . " " You know , " Jean says as he sits by the fire in his lodge today , stroking Chianti and smoking his pipe , " I really believe that there is not much a blind man ca n't do except drive a car . I have found ways to do almost everything I did before I lost my sight . I gave up painting only because I think it 's phony when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I create sculpture , wood carvings and tile mosaics , I 'm working in the touch arts . ' I can feel what I 'm creating . It 's the same when I the plan was to bring the visually handicapped to Aspen to participate in supervised winter and summer sports . To provide a force of volunteer guides and around-the-clock " buddies " who would help mesh the blind , naturally , into the social and sporting arena of the sighted . On the ski slopes , in the campsites , on the trails and trout lakes and around the town for dining , dancing and cultural activities . Since Jean was at that time vice-president of the Aspen Lions Club , it naturally followed that this organization offered the original endorsement and financial aid to Jean 's first BOLD club . " I want to make these blind people laugh and feel the wind on their faces , as I have , " Jean would say to a Continued on page 107 ride a horse or ski down a mountain  --  yes , even skiing , which is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's just an indescribable exultation for the blind person . " And if you pour Jean a glass of his favorite French wine , he 'll tell you about the time in deer season when he strapped a sign on his back reading Blind Hunter , then strolled through Aspen town with his 30-30 rifle slung over his shoulder and Chianti , straining in his harness by his side . " Everyone psyched out , and when someone finally asked me , ' My God , how can a blind man shoot a deer ? ' I laughed and said , ' It 's easy ... My dog scents a deer , freezes and points , and I just line up my rifle between his ears and shoot ... How can I miss ? " This is Jean Eymere today . A blind man always laughing at himself , always loving life . And when the adoption agency called saying the child Jean and Wils had waited for so long was ready to come to them , Jean 's unhesitating answer to the probes about his blindness was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't take sight to love . " Today the Eymeres have two adopted boys , Olivier and Dominique . Jean says , as he scoops them into his lap , " The only real tragedy in my life is not being able to see my boys . " By now Jean was not just living ; he was soaring . But personal victory was not enough for this benevolent man . " I really did n't get the full kick out of life , " he says , " until the day I came upon the thought ? ' if I can do these things then maybe a lot of other visually handicapped people can learn to do them too . ' " In 1970 , spurred by his obsessive belief that " dynamic action stimulates the mind and the senses so a blind person can achieve total awareness , " Jean Eymere founded the nonprofit organization called BOLD  --  Blind Outdoor Leisure Development . Initially continued from page 101 potential benefactor . Jean 's good friend , Jack Schuss , a New York investment specialist and Executive Director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations began pouring in from other local sources . Jean spent many weeks on the ski slopes training volunteer instructors in the highly specialized ski instruction techniques for the blind , and it was n't long before the volunteers were lined up and Aspen BOLD was poised to receive its first recruits . A group of boys and girls from the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind came for a week of ski instruction . None had ever been on skis and most had been blind since birth . Jean deliberately chose skiing as the kickoff to his BOLD program , instead of the relatively easier summer sports , because , as he put it , " If a physically inactive blind person can suddenly conquer something so outlandish as skiing , a sport that challenges even the sighted , then he or she will know that there may be no limit to what can be achieved . This was the notion that got me off the ground : if I can ski , I can do anything . " But it was one thing for Jean to prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went blind . Now he and his specially trained instructors faced the big test  --  to teach the-blind to ski from absolute scratch . With the future of BOLD riding on the nose . It worked . Jean 's dedication and enthusiasm got through to the young students . Wearing fluorescent orange bibs reading Blind Skier , and utilizing a **27;3785;TOOLONG system , coupled with constant voice command from their instructors , they all learned in one week how to ride the ski lifts and ski the beginner slopes under control . There were no failures . When the going got rough , as it many times did , Jean was always there , laughing and clowning and urging the students on until they found that exultant sense of release and joy that in all their sightless years they had never known . After dark there was skating in the Brown Ice Palace , dancing and camaraderie in Aspen 's bistros . Before they left , several students signed up to return to the BOLD summer program . Never having ridden a horse or caught a trout , they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped it all up this way : " The BOLD experience is not just the sighted helping the blind  --  it 's people having fun together . This is what is so great about it . " The summer program was an instant success and , as predicted , relatively easier than the skiing . Groups of visually handicapped of all ages and backgrounds came to Aspen , stayed with Jean in his Coachlight Chalet and followed him , Pied Piper fashion , into the wilderness , with packs on their backs and laughter in their hearts . Jean Eymere 's dream had come full circle . He was convinced that his BOLD program could do for other visually handicapped what he had done for himself . With the Aspen BOLD club now successfully offering a lifeline to blind people all across the country , Jean and his Executive Director , Jack Schuss , founded BOLD , Inc. , the national parent organization encompassing regional BOLD clubs now operating from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh . Each year , Jean Eymere and Jack Schuss travel and lecture , show movies of BOLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer instructor-guides . " We could n't believe the response , " Jean said . " We 'd come into an area , show the BOLD ski movie and ask for a couple of volunteers to come out on the slopes with us and learn our teaching techniques , and the whole ski school would turn out . This is the way it has been all the way . It really makes me feel great to see all this happening . " Since the BOLD fever has caught on across the land , the press and national TV networks have picked up the story . In the fall of 1974 , John Denver showed sequences from the award-winning BOLD ski movie on TV when he hosted the Johnny Carson " Tonight " show . CBS has periodically projected three-minute film segments of BOLD in action and many newspapers have carried Jean 's ongoing story with action photos . All of this adds up to Jean 's dream of getting his message to as many visually handicapped people as he can reach . In his words , " You have to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride public transportation unassisted . Now we 're building houses and climbing mountains . We can be creative , active people living life to the hilt . We are no longer members of a helpless minority , and the sighted need to get this message . " BOLD has come a long way since 1970 and so has its founder . In 1973 , Jean was the only blind competitor in the downhill ski racing events of the International Handicapped Championships in France . And just recently he has put on figure-skating exhibitions on the rinks of Europe and America . Jean thought he had done it all , until one day last summer when three mountain-climbing friends said , " We 're climbing Castle Peak tomorrow , and you 're coming with us . " " Crazy , " said Jean , " but if you think I can do it , I do it . " The next morning at dawn they all roped up for the tricky climb . Before sundown , Jean stood triumphantly on the 14,265-foot summit of the fifth highest peak in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
