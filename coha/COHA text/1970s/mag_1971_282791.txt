AT first glance , it looks like a movie set for Walden Two . There is a shop building called Harmony , a farmhouse called Llano , and a dormitory called Oneida . Bulletin boards list upcoming cultural events , and young people lounge on hammocks , reading and engaging in serious discussions . The smell of farm-fresh cooking is everywhere . The resemblance to Walden Two is more than superficial . Twin Oaks , a 123-acre farm commune nestled in the foothills of Virginia 's Piedmont , is a remarkable attempt to create a Utopian community governed by Skinner 's laws of social engineering . <P> Work is allocated by an intricate system of labor credits so that none of the 35 members have unequal burdens . Titles and honorifics have been done away with so that , in the words of the community 's code , " all are entitled to the same privileges , advantages and respect . " Private property is forbidden , except for such things as books and clothing , and even with that loophole , most members draw their clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . No one is allowed to boast of individual accomplishments , to gossip ( " negative speech " ) or to be intolerant of another 's beliefs . <P> Behavioral engineering goes on every minute of the day . A member who gets angry , who makes demands or who gives ultimatums is simply not " reinforced , " to use the behavioral term . He is ignored . What is considered appropriate behavior-cooperating , showing affection , turning the other cheek and working diligently-is , on the other hand , applauded , or " reinforced , " by the group . Members are singled out for compliments if they do a job well ; signs are put up telling who cleaned a room , for example . Smokers who wanted to break the cigarette habit formed a group to help one another . Cigarettes were put in progressively more inconvenient spots , and each member of the group received congratulations for every day he spent without tobacco . <P> The use of tobacco and alcohol is , in fact , discouraged at Twin Oaks , and all drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is considered a cultural poison . " We decided that we just were n't strong enough to stand up to television , " says Kat Griebe , one of Twin Oaks ' charter founders and , at 40 , one of the oldest members . " Its powerful message is that of middle-class American values , which we reject-a high level of consumption , streamlined cosmetic standards of beauty , male dominance , the use of violence as a problem solver , and the underlying assumption that life should be a constant state of titillation and excitement . Life just is n't like that . " <P> Especially life at Twin Oaks . The favorite sports are " cooperation volleyball " and skinny-dipping in the South Anna River-false modesty is another of the sins that are not reinforced-and there is plenty of folk singing and dancing . In a departure from Skinner 's rather puritanical Walden Two , sex is considered , as one member put it , a " pleasant pastime , like anything else . " Adds Kat : " We do n't have a very high opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high regard for what Skinner calls ' abiding affection . ' "
