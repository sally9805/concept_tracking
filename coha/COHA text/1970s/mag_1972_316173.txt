Proponents of European unity have long dreamed of creating a single Common Market currency . Lately the finance ministers of the Market nations have taken a long step toward that goal by limiting the distance that their currencies can fluctuate against each other in the world 's money markets . <P> The accord , which is to take effect by July 1 , reduces the " trading margins " of the six member currencies from 4% to 2% . In practice , that will mean Common Market currencies can drift no more than l ? % either above or below the midpoint of the new 2% band . When any one currency reaches its upper or lower limits , the central banks of member countries will intervene by buying or selling each other 's currencies . Until now , the banks have done this by buying or selling dollars . <P> In the long run , the pact threatens to depose the dollar as the pre-eminent currency in international trade . Reason : Common Market moneys will still be able to fluctuate within the present band of 4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to each other . European importers and exporters will no doubt feel safer issuing invoices in one of their own currencies , which can fluctuate only half as much as the dollar . Even a spokesman for the East German government declared that his country is " no longer interested " in trade deals set in dollars . Multinational corporations will probably convert more of their dollar holdings into Common Market currencies . Such selling of the dollar may tend to reduce its price in world money markets . <P> The day of a truly unified Eurocurrency-or " Euro " as moneymen call it - is still far away . Treasury Secretary John Connally , for one , is not overeager to see that day arrive . With a single currency , he fears , Europe may congeal into a unified economic bloc competing against the U.S. , and the Europeans may let their currency float downward against the dollar whenever they want an added trade advantage against the U.S. At present , national rivalries prevent such truly coordinated action . <P> The Common Market ministers did not specify any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilders and lire by some supranational monetary unit . An alternative might be that the Common Market currencies will continue to exist side by side , with each bank note carrying a printed table of its equivalent value in sister currencies . Already the ministers have agreed that the trading margins of their money will eventually be reduced to zero .
