txt Clare A. Aldrich , 50 years old , has two engineering degrees and 25 years of experience in the aerospace business . He helped design the Apollo command and service modules for North American Rockwell Corp . and earned $20,000 a year . Now he drives a Yellow cab and considers himself lucky . Thousands of other out-of-work aerospace scientists , engineers and technicians are drawing $65-a-week unemployment compensation or have already exhausted their 26 weeks of benefits . Some try with little success to sell real estate or life insurance , others use life savings to buy fried chicken franchises , and a few cut lawns or wash dishes . They call themselves the " aero-braceros " and vow that their sons will never become engineers . They are victims of deep cutbacks in Government spending on defense and aerospace projects . The cutbacks began in January 1968 , and they are accelerating . A Severe Impact Defense Department procurement and research outlays for aircraft , missiles , space activities , electronics and communications dropped to $17.5 billion in the fiscal year ending July 31 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to drop further to $16.6 billion next year and to $16.2 billion in fiscal 1972 . Meantime , expenditures by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have fallen to $3.9 billion this year from $4.2 billion in fiscal 1969 , and they 're expected to drop to $3.3 billion or so by fiscal 1972 . The impact on areas with aerospace and defense plants has been severe . What 's happening here in Southern California , which has the heaviest concentration of aerospace plants in the nation , is mirrored in other cities around the U.S. to varying degrees . In Los Angeles and Orange Counties alone , aerospace employment as of March had fallen to 338,000 , a 22% decline from a December 1967 peak of 435,000 . Further employment declines are predicted well into 1971 , says Mrs. Pauline Sweezey , economist for the state of California . Aerospace employment has always fluctuated . But economists say that now , for the first time since World War II , not only production workers but thousands of highly educated engineers and scientists are being laid off and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Hiring " In the past when one aerospace company lost a big contract , another company could be expected to take up the slack and at least hire the engineers and scientists with master 's and PhD degrees . But now defense budget cuts , a slowdown in space exploration and a falloff in orders for commercial aircraft have combined all at once to cause sales and profits to fall and layoffs to increase throughout the industry . " No one is hiring , " reports Bob Leventhal , executive director of the Southern California Association of Professional Engineers . Most young engineers will " bounce back , " probably in another field , but the older engineers are in serious trouble , says Jerry Sklarsky , president of the Engineers and Scientists Guild at Lockheed Aircraft Corp . Clare Aldrich is a case in point . He and his wife have been struggling to meet the mortgage payments on their $30,000 home in Thousand Oaks , a Los Angeles suburb . After he was laid off by North American Rockwell in 1968 , Mr. Aldrich , an expert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that petered out , he got the job driving a cab . He now works a six-day , 60-hour week and makes " about as much as when we first were married , " says Mrs. Aldrich . " We 've cut out some insurance , stopped buying clothes or going out and hope we can hold on to the house , " she says . When he switched to cab driving , he lost nine pounds the first two weeks . " All his experience and education ? it 's such a waste , " says Mrs. Aldrich . " Yet how do you put them back to work without going back into the war effort ? " An Irreplaceable Pool Mr. Leventhal and others in Government and the industry fear that layoffs are destroying a national pool of talented aerospace and defense engineers and that the U.S. will never have the chance to put it together again . Executives of North American Rockwell Corp. , hardest hit of the Southern California aerospace giants , say they 're worried about the possible loss of their " irreplaceable designdevelopment team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of North American Rockwell , says the team comprises about 1,000 or more highly paid , highly skilled scientists and engineers  --  a basic creative core needed by a manufacturer to win contracts and fulfill them . North American Rockwell is one of three aerospace companies competing for the last of the large military contracts scheduled for the near future  --  the Air Force 's B-1 strategic bomber . The award for the development and testing contract was originally due to be announced today or Monday ; sources say , however , that the announcement has been delayed at least until May 28 while the Pentagon restudies proposals for the plane 's electronics system . Other competitors are Boeing Co. of Seattle , also hit by heavy layoffs and financial trouble , and General Dynamics Corp. , whose Ft . Worth , Texas , plant would produce the bomber if the company won . This Tuesday North American Rockwell 's space division was one of two firms selected to provide design studies for NASA 's proposed reusable space shuttle system . The $8 million contract will run for 11 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment at the division . The Nixon Administration has given NASA a go-ahead for preliminary development of the shuttle and an accompanying space station , but it has n't yet made a firm commitment to carry through with these costly projects . North American Rockwell executives imply that if they do n't win the B-1 bomber contract , their development team will break up and cease to be an effective force in the airframe business . If they win , the contract will eventually create 25,000 jobs in California , including suppliers and subcontractors , Mr. Walker says . If North American Rockwell wins , it will be the first big piece of good news at the company in a long time . The company was the prime contractor for the Apollo command and service modules and thus a prime loser when the space program was cut back . Then last December . in the competition for the contract to build the F15 Air Force fighter , North American lost tol Douglas Corp . North American had spent more than $25 million of its own money m the competition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space cuts . North American laid off 5.000 employes . If it fails to win the B-1 , another 8,000 workers will be laid off . Even if it wins the B-1 , North American will still have to lay off 1.500 more workers through November . A further problem : The heavy layoffs have endangered the company 's 10-year-old program to pay extended benefits to laid-off employees . Slashes in Salaries North American has slashed salaries of executives , engineers , department heads , accountants and manufacturing personnel . Managerial changes have been widespread . Three of the company 's divisions have been " restructured , " with many executives either transferred to staff positions in the corporate headquarters or laid off . At Lockheed Aircraft Corp . the problem is not loss of contracts but financing . The nation 's biggest defense contractor has a backlog of $4.84 billion , half of it in commercial orders , chiefly for the company 's L-1011 Tri-Star " air bus . " And although the company 's total employment is expected to decline to 88,000 by the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants ? now about 31,000 ? is expected to rise slightly during the rest of the year as- production of the L-1011 accelerates . But Lockheed is embroiled in one of the largest and most complicated contract disputes in the history of the Defense Department . The company says the Government owes it more than $1 billion in claims on four major weapons programs : The Air Force C5A cargo jet , the Army 's Cheyenne helicopter , rocket engines for the Air Force 's short-range attack missile ( SRAM ) and 22 Navy ships . In March , Lockheed asked the Defense Department for $640 million in interim financing , saying it would have to stop work on the programs if the money was n't forthcoming . Last week the House of Representatives passed the Defense Department procurement bill for fiscal 1971 , which included a $544A million allotment for Lockheed . But the prospect for passage in the Senate when the bill comes up for debate early next month is less than certain . Lockheed hopes to lessen its dependence on Government business through sales of its 256-seat air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 173 of the transcontinental planes  --  not nearly enough to put the program in the black . Faced with a slowdown in air traffic and declining earnings , the airlines have stopped ordering the jumbo jets . Daniel J. Haughton , Lockheed chairman , says he expects a " slow placement of orders " for the rest of the year but believes that in the long run the program will be a success . The victory of Douglas in the battle for the F15 was a severe blow to California , because most of the F15 work will be done at the company 's St. Louis headquarters rather than its Southern California installations . Moreover , Douglas had already cut employment at its California plants to 54,000 from 71,000 on Jan. 1 , 1969 . The reasons : Cancelation of the Air Force 's plans to build a Manned Orbiting Laboratory and dwindling orders for DC8 and DC9 airliners . Small Suppliers Hurt The aerospace cutbacks have affected not only the big contractors but also dozens of small suppliers and subcontractors . Many are already bankrupt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no backlog . Trig Aircraft Corp. , in Gardena , a Los Angeles suburb , makes airplane door hinges for Douglas and North American Rockwell . Employment has fallen to 12 from 30 as a result of a 50% sales decline this year . Perry Enterprises , a Lawndale , Calif. , machine shop that made spare parts for Douglas , North American and Lockheed , once had 39 machinists on the payroll . Now owner Ray Perry keeps a crew of only three . Sonic aerospace executives believe the final answer to the aerospace-defense slowdown is to diversify entirely outside aircraft and space . They believe , for instance , that their companies ' unique ability to focus intensive engineering and analytical talents on technical problems would be useful in finding answers to many social woes of the day . But they are finding the transition hard . " Everyone is talking about opportunities in environmental engineering , urban renewal , housing and systems analysis in health and education , " says Lockheed 's senior economic adviser , Harry Biederman . " But the problem is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every city , state and county . The market is fragmented . And it takes an awful lot of systems analysis contracts to take the place of a C5A cargo jet . " Aerospace industry analysts cite Northrop Corp . of Beverly Hills as the industry 's best example of diversification . Thomas V. Jones , chairman , has moved the company away from reliance on any one large contract . The company 's current contracts range from building a $175 million telecommunications network for Iran to making fuselages for the Boeing 747 to developing the P530 tactical fighter . The company also has moved heavily into the overseas market , selling its low-cost ( $800,000 ) F5 " Freedom Fighter " to 15 countries . Rohr Corp . of Chula Vista , now heavily in aerospace , is diversifying into the ground transportation business . Rohr won a $66.7 million contract to build 250 rail cars for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District . While the aerospace industry struggles to diversify , the out-of-work aerospace engineers see themselves as the victims of a shift in national priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45-year-old former trainer of Apollo Astronauts for North American Rockwell who now operates a Tastee Freez ice cream stand in Brea , Calif. , says : " I do n't feel sorry for myself . I 'm just a sign of the times . " In Burbank one laid-off engineer bought a power lawn mower and an edger and started a lawn-cutting business . " Hell , I 'm making more money and having a better time than I ever did as an engineer , " he says . " And I 'm out in the sun all day . "
