AUTOS Moving on a Fast Track into 1977 <P> They are accorded no separate listing on any of the official indexes of the nation 's economic health . Yet no other single category of commercial activity more acutely reflects the state of the nation 's economy than auto sales . Last week , as the year-end figures were added up , the results provided strong proof that the U.S. is in fact coming out of the prolonged business " pause " of late summer and fall . After flattening out disappointingly in October and November , in December new-car sales jumped 16% above those of a year earlier . That surge made 1976 the domestic industry 's best year since 1973 : U.S. automakers wound up selling 8.6 million cars , or 22% more than in 1975 . What is more , most automen believe that this year will bring even better results . They predict that sales of American cars will come close to the 1973 record of 9.7 million and , since prices are much higher , the industry will enjoy its first $100 billion sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 figures are especially pleasing to auto executives for several reasons . First , they reversed two years of disastrous sales decline that had led some critics of Detroit to believe , mistakenly , that the American public 's longstanding love affair with the auto was ending . Second , buyers turned away from foreign cars to snap up the American makes . Import sales actually declined in 1976 to 14.3% of the total market , their smallest share in four years . Two reasons : imports are heavily concentrated in no longer popular small cars , and the rising value of the German mark and the Japanese yen has pushed prices up sharply . <P> Finally , the surge in American-made cars was strong enough to benefit each of the Big Three-General Motors , Ford and Chrysler-though to very different degrees . The sole exception to the industry 's prosperity is fourth-ranked American Motors , which offers a limited selection of models , the majority of which are small cars . A.M.C. suffered a 23% drop-off in 1976 sales , and piled up losses for the business year ending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a gingerly question as to whether it could stay in business . Actually , the company has reduced its debt and break-even point so greatly that no one expects it to go under . Nonetheless , A.M.C. , pleading poverty , last week asked the United Auto Workers to extend its contract until Sept. 16 , rather than shooting for a wage boost now . <P> Each of the Big Three had something special to brag about . GM increased its already top-heavy share of the domestic market to a record 55.8% , from 53.1% in 1975 . To get an early start on meeting federal reg-ulatioris that require U.S.-made autos to average 27.5 m.p.g. by 1985 , GM has ' taken a multi-billion-dollar gamble in shrinking the size and weight of its cars . The public 's approval of the lighter and crisply styled autos has delighted GM executives . Cadillac , which brought out its Mercedes-size Seville , experienced its best year ever in 1976 . For the first time , Oldsmobile 's intermediate-size Cutlass shoved aside Chevrolet and Ford to become the nation 's bestselling single make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on intermediate lines , scored an impressive 49.5% increase in sales .
