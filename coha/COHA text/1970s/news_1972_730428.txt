txt Stanley T. Kusper Jr . gathered his loyal staff of payrollers around him one day last May in the rear of the Board of Election Commissioners office and reminded them where their loyalties lay . " Come November , " he told them with rising anger in his voice , " there are n't going to be any cracks in the wall of this office . Nobody has cracked this office from the outside . " Kusper had spoken a bit prematurely , however , because I was standing only about 15 feet from him . In fact , I had already spent a month working undercover in his office and would spend two more months . And , not being one of his loyal payrollers , I had to agree he certainly had reason to fear a stranger 's " cracking " his office . " This is the hottest seat in the city . " Kusper went on to say at that meeting , occasionally slamming an emphatic fist on the table at which he was seated . " The hottest in Cook County  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better believe there is a man in Washington right now who has got his eye on this office . You had better believe there are a lot of people who would like to tear this office apart from the inside out . " Kusper kept his people late that night because he wanted to impress upon.them that there are people who would like to snoop and pry thru his office . That 's the last thing in the world he wants . He likes things the way they are now , thank you . The way things are now is that he has a staff of 200 persons , 196 of them Democratic patronage workers . That means the City 's electoral machinery  --  the registration of voters . That means the city 's electoral judges , the records of past elections ? are in the hands of Democrats . Does n't Want Inspection Kusper does not want an outsider to see how his Democratic staff is handling this machinery . He does n't want anybody to see how many thousands of nonexistent voters are registered in his files ? nonexistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Democratic votes and victories . He does n't want anybody to see how loyal Democrats are appointed as Republican judges of election year after year . In short , he does n't want anybody from the outside to see how vote fraud is fostered and protected in his office , Room 308 of City Hall . But I saw it . I saw it and worked with it from the inside for three months . Had Kucharski Backing I was able to get on the inside thru Edmund J. Kucharski , chairman of the Cook County Republican Central Committee . Kucharski seized the opportunity of a vacancy for a Republican clerk in Kusper 's office last April and sent me in with a letter of recommendation . In applying for the job , I used my real name and address , educational and work history , failing only to mention my present employment . The application asked only for my past employment . I was hired as a $20-a-day clerk over Kusper 's objections and went to work in a department handling judges of election . At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper 's Task Force reporting team , and Kucharski knew what I was doing . Any new employe in Kusper 's office is regarded with suspicion at first , but I soon found out how closely a new Republican employe is watched . Viewed with Suspicion " When I first saw you around here , " one payroller told me during a coffee break on my second day on the job , " I thought you were one of those bastards from the B. G. A. fBetter Government Association or the I. V. I. Independent Voters of Illinois . and others liked to sidle up next to Tribune Photo Edmund J. Kucharski " But then I found out you are even worse . You are a Republican . " He was laughing , but he was serious . He liked to call me the " guy from the I. V. I. " after that . And he me as I took notes on my work , " just to see what you 're doing . " In hindsight , I would guess now that I must have looked rather strange taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got to be a crisis each night to discreetly stuff them into my pockets and steal them out of the office . " Date " Was Typewriter When I left work at night , I found myself being followed by Kusper 's cronies . They followed me to Tribune Tower several times , I discovered later , but Kusper decided I was going to meet a girl friend . If only that had been the case . The only date I had each night , the , was another 8 to 10 hours of work transcribing my notes of fraud cases into readable form for my newspaper colleagues to work with . The fraud cases I found came directly off the records handled day in and day out by Kusper 's own staff . They were incredibly simple to find , considering I knew nothing about the office 's filing system , yet I found them while Kusper 's staff did n't seem to look . The most graphic example I encountered of Kusper 's staff skipping over obvious fraud cases came when I began examining ballot applications from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications , Kusper 's people had been thru them only a few days before . What 's Really Behind It They were stacked according to precinct in a storeroom . I pulled out Tribune Pholo Stanley T. Kusper Jr . several stacks of applications one day and seated myself next to the mound of cartons containing public relations pamphlets entitled " What 's Behind Your Vote . " As I began to thumb thru the ballot applications , I began to see what is behind the vote in Chicago . I came across hundreds of ballot applications that contained such obvious forgeries they almost jumped up and knocked me off my chair . I found scores of applications that had been left blank , but had been used to ring up Democratic votes anyhow . It would have been impossible for anybody to miss seeing the fraud , but Kusper 's people either missed them or saw them and never said a word . In defense of the people who work for Kusper , I found many of them hardworking and conscientious as far as their jobs would allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be . " Do what you are specifically told to do , and do no more . " " It 's hard work , - a woman in the office told me one day , " because it 's so exacting . It 's easy to make mistakes , but you ca n't make anybody understand that when all those newspapers start writing fraud stories about us . " Easy to Find Mistakes Indeed , it was easy to find mistakes . But when I went thru the office files , I found patterns of such massive fraud and chicanery that they could not be passed off as mere clerical errors . You ca n't pass off the Democratic voting records of hundreds of Republican election judges as simple oversight . You ca n't dismiss the scores of altered voting records as the slip of somebody 's pen . You ca n't ignore the thousands of ghost voters who remain in registration files by calling it sloppy filing . Checked Only a Fraction Those are some of the things I found , and I found them by looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my regular duties . That fact is what scared me . Looking thru a relatively small amount of records , I found more than 1,000 cases of fraud . And when I left Kusper 's office for the last time , I was not so much impressed with the numbers I found as with the numbers I must have left behind . The experience left me feeling I had grasped only a tip of an iceberg .
