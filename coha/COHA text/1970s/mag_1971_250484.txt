Heading into the showdown Senate vote on the SST , proponents clung to a single hope , wispy as a contrail , of keeping the aircraft from crashing . Their head count showed 49 Senators against the plane , 47 for it , two absent and two wavering : Maine 's Margaret Chase Smith and Kentucky 's John Sherman Cooper . If Richard Nixon could land those two Republicans , the SST might yet take off . Vice President Spiro Agnew stood ready to cast a tie-breaking vote to continue the aircraft 's funding . <P> Nixon telephoned Cooper , pleaded for his support . Cooper had voted against the aircraft last year , but he did not want to get tagged as an anti-Nixon Republican and thus lose his influence with the President on foreign affairs , his main interest . Moreover , Cooper 's <P> Kentucky colleague , Republican Marlowe Cook , had switched from his anti-SST vote last year to stand with the Administration this time . <P> Leave Her Alone . Nixon also pursued the independent Mrs. Smith , who had opposed the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sent her a " Dear Margaret " letter announcing that he was " pleased " to rescind an order by the Johnson Administration closing the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on the Maine-New Hampshire border . With cool class , Mrs. Smith showed the letter to newsmen , and blandly said that she was " very much gratified " by the President 's decision . <P> Just as intent upon getting Mrs. Smith 's vote , aides of Wisconsin Democrat William Proxmire , who has been a leader in the fight against the SST for ten years , followed a more prudent course . They asked other Senators how to approach her , were warned flatly to " leave her alone " - and they did . <P> In the final hours before the roll call , Nixon also summoned to the White House five Senators believed to be against him on the issue . He saw another avenue of possible success when two of them , New York 's Freshman Senator James Buckley and Colorado 's Republican Peter Dominick , assured him that they would vote for the plane . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the roll call began in a hushed and crowded chamber , opponents of the SST proceeded slowly in the hope that one of their number , Indiana Democrat Birch Bayh , could return in time from a Colorado skiing trip , which he had recklessly extended to the day of the vote . Slowed by icy roads , Bayh missed a flight-and the roll call . <P> Shocks . The clerk had reached only the fourth name , that of New Mexico Democrat Clinton Anderson , when the Administration received its first shock . Anderson , an intimate of one of the SST 's prime supporters , Washington <P> Democrat Henry Jackson ( who is married to Anderson 's former secretary ) , voted no . Proxmire smiled with surprise , lifted a closed fist in a " go , team " gesture . Anderson , who had voted for the plane before , explained that his mail had run heavily against it this time . Friends suggested that he was influenced by his wife Henrietta , who has become aroused about ecological hazards .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
