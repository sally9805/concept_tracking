txt Letters ARTHUR C. GRUENALEXANDER FREUNDBEULAH L. BRUCKHEIMWALTER T. SCHOEN JR.DANIEL Letters Labor Productivi : ' Nothing Has Gone Wrong ' To the Editor : The decline in labor productivity in the past few years has generated considerable comment of the " Where have we gone wrong ? " variety . A look at the underlying causes of this phenomenon will indicate that , in fact , this development should have been expected and nothing has gone wrong at all . What has happened is that the babyboom children have grown up and entered the labor force in record numbers . They are a well-educated generation with a high rate of participation of women . This dramatic increase in the supply of skilled labor has reduced its cost relative to that of capital . The rational employer can , therefore , lower the cost of production by substituting skilled labor for capital in the production process . In the past three years 10 million new jobs have been created ? the fastest peacetime increase in employment in our history . Not only ate more people working , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Labor productivity is measured by dividing the G.N.P . by the number of workers . When employment increases faster than the G.N.P. , labor productivity falls . This is what we have witnessed . It does not reflect inefficiency on the part of the workers . An efficient economy should utilize its abundant resources and conserve its scarce resources . As labor become relatively more abundant , the capital-labor ratio is reduced . The result is increased capital productivity and decreased labor productivity . One could just as easily proclaim the former as decry the latter . In any case it is cheaper to use available labor than unavailable capital . For those still distressed by this structural change in the economy the cure is at hand . The latest unemployment figures reflect a growing scarcity in skilled labor in some sectors . The low birth rate of the past two decades is beginning to be felt in the labor market and it appears that the growth of the labor force has reached its peak . As the supply of labor grows at a slower rate , managers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce a new round of investment , whether the capital gains tax is reduced or not . As the capital stock grows faster than employment , labor productivity will rise and everyone will again be happy . ARTHUR C. GRUEN Assistant Professor of Economics Hunter College New York , Nov. 5 , 1978 To Spot a Small Plane Six Avoidable Deaths Cambodia and the U.S. : On a Radar Screen Strange Bedfellows ' To the Editor : To the Editor : There has been much concern and controversy over the recent plane collision in California . Solutions are being sought to avoid reoccurrences . A simple solution has been overlooked . The F.A.A. traffic control uses beacon and radar scanning of the airways . Large aircraft have beacon code transmitters , which are easily tracked . On the other hand , small aircraft have no such instruments and are generally built out of low radar reflective material . This causes a problem in radar tracking . Some small aircraft may be mistaken for radar noise rather than a valid radar detection and possibly be hidden from observation until a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the installation of high radar reflective material on all flying objects . The cost would be relatively small . This reflective material can be placed in an area which is always directed toward the ground and visible to radar . As an added advantage , the radar sensitivity of the trackers may be decreased to lessen the interfering noise , thus assuring clearer detection . Fighter planes have been and are designed with low radar reflectivity profiles for nondetection . Why not have high radar reflectivity during ceacetime for all aircraft ? ALEXANDER FREUND Downingtown , Pa. , Nov. 4 , 1978 On Finding ' M.I.A. 's To the Editor : Every time I hear of M.I.A. 's being turned over to visiting Congressmen I boil . It shows what kind of people we are trying to deal with ? or should I say placate ? Why should these M.I.A. 's be found so conveniently whenever our Congressmen go there , and only then ? Now in Laos we are getting back four men . How can people be so cruel as to leave the families of these men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can our Government take all this with no comment and still want to send them help ? I 'd like an answer . BEULAH L. BRUCKHEIM Binghamton , N. Y. , Nov. 6 , 1978 Now that some time has passed since the tragic deaths in a Brooklyln fire of six New York firemen , it is appropriate to consider whether these deaths could have been avoided . Friends and relatives of these brave men could find more comfort if the deaths had not been useless , but the sad truth is that their deaths served no useful purpose . No lives were saved and the building was destroyed . Some hard questions must be asked . Why is it necessary to send men to rooftops of burning buildings to chop holes in the roof so that heat can escape ? Has fire science made no progress at all in this respect ? If firefighting techniques still require this procedure , could not small explosive charges be placed from a cherry picker ? When it is definitely established that no persons are in burning buildings , should not fire-fighting efforts be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building ? The Mayor and the Fire Commissioner must address themselves to these questions if we are to avoid future tragedies of this kind . WALTER T. SCHOEN JR . Gladstone , N. J. , Nov.5 , 1978 Bikes and the City To the Editor : Recent suggestions have called for a bicycle registration fee to recoup city expenditures for bicyclists . Since vehicle registration fees are by weight , a 30-lb. bicycle would have a 22-cent annual fee . One million bikes would gross $220,000 , which would n't even cover the administrative expenses . Why not register pedestrians as well ? After all , the city spends a lot on them , too . Comment about how bicyclists continue to endanger themselves and others is ridiculous . Most cyclists do not ; those who do are generally children . They need policing and some words about safety . In any case , their threat to safety ca n't be compared with the danger presented by cabbies abruptly pulling over or stopping , or with mammoth trucks bullying their way around at high speeds . A mature bicyclist deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nov.6 , 1978 To the Editor : Balance-of-power politics has always made strange bedfellows , but the strangest of all may be Cambodia and the United States . The U.S. has now warned Moscow to restrain Vietnam from invading Cambodia for fear that a Vietnamese victory could strengthen the strategic position of Russia and Vietnam while weakening the Chinese in that area of the world . All I can ask is whatever happened to the concern of the U.S. for human rights ? The Cambodian Government from all accounts may well be one of the most barbaric governments in the history of the world . It is therefore difficult to conceive that any government the Vietnamese might impose on the Cambodians could possibly be more detrimental to the welfare of the Cambodian people than the current regime . As too often in the past the U.S. finds itself defending the indefensible . We killed a million or more people in Vietnam to defend a democracy that never existed . Now we want to maintain stability in a country where the only constants in recent years have been bloodshed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify our policy on the grounds that one nation should not intervene militarily in the domestic affairs of another . I am sure the Vietnamese would appreciate hearing that from US . ROBERT SHEVLIN New York , Nov. 5 , 1978 Time for Bargaining To the Editor : In order to evaluate the impact of automation on labor unionists and management from a social and economic viewpoint , a standing committee of labor union representatives and management should be created . They could meet twice yearly . This could prevent the cliff-hanging process that occurs too often hours before the collective bargaining agreement expires . Deadline bargaining creates psychological tensions that take too long to subside . It is good to have The New York ? Times again . ABRAHAM ALBERT DESSER New York , Nov. 6. 1978 Tourism : The High Rewards of Loving New York To the Editor : The " I Love New York " campaign , created to aid the economic development of our state , has stimulated boundless enthusiasm for the unparalleled beauties of upstate New York , the grandeur of the Long Island coast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done but we have come a long way in a short time . In 1975 state and local governments received $682 million in tax revenues from travel-related businesses . These businesses provide jobs for over 200,000 people in our state . In spite of tourism 's importance to the state 's economy , its development potential had virtually been ignored by the state . New York had the dubious distinction of being the lowest-ranking state of 26 rated by U.S. Travel Survey in promotion expenditures per traveler . We were spending 3 cents for each traveler , while each traveler spent at least $112 . Our neighbors , other major tourism states and foreign vacation spots were all aggressively competing for New York 's tourist market . The 1977 legislative session marked a positive change . Our state , with the approval of Governor Carey , appropriated funds for a major tourism promotional program . This was done after a comprehensive market research study by an independent company , commissioned by the State Commerce Department , revealed that the state had everything vacationers wanted but lagged in their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for out-of-staters and our own residents . The research firm gave detailed plans on how to attract the growing leisure-oriented segment of U.S. population which wanted country atmosphere , beautiful scenery , mountains , lakes , skiing , fishing , boating , camping , etc. ? all things our state can offer in profusion . New York City appealed to a different audience and had to be promoted differently . It offers entertainment and cultural opportunities unmatched anywhere in the world but suffers from image problems . Because of the detailed information providing the sound basis for funding requests by the Commerce Department , and the resulting enthusiastic support by the Legislature and Governor Carey , we embarked upon the unbelievably successful " I Love New York " advertising campaign . We know that in the first year summer tourist business was reported to have increased by 25 percent in some areas of the state . Attendance at the state parks increased , Thruway traffic was up and the demand for New York State maps was 200 percent greater in some areas . We know that after the Broadway Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating at capacity and New York City restaurants were booming . In fact , the eightweek period starting on Valentine 's Day , 1978 , when the Broadway show promotion began , theater attendance increased by 199,000 , ticket sales increased by $2.7 million and total expenditures by travelers increased by $8.6 million . This meant an additional $700,000 in state and local sales taxes . Not only have travel-related businesses experienced an upsurge , other retail businesses in tourist areas have benefited . At a recent meeting of the State Board of Tourism Commissioners , an upstate member reported that for the first time in memory his county had experienced higher sales figures for the third quarter of the year than for the Christmas period . " I Love New York " has been a positive influence . The State Board of Tourism Commissioners , a bipartisan group of unpaid individuals appointed to oversee the program , hopes that this program will flourish with bipartisan support for the benefit of the entire state for many years to come .
