" Like both of you . There 's a lot of him in you , Michael , and in Sean as well , and no better thing could be said of you . Win Standish rode in , his horse dusty . He was a compact , solid young man of medium height , with a serious expression . He looked exactly like what he was , a rising young businessman . " They are coming , Senora . I could not stop them . They would not listen and , of course , they have the law . " " Let them come . " Far down the road , the riders appeared . There were three of them . " They 'll get nothing . Nothing at all . " " There must be no violence now , " Michael warned . " I can not condone it . " " Nor I , " Win added . " Would you have me lose the place then ? " " You could not save it , Senora . They have the strength , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt is due . " " Yes , but we have the ranch , and we shall keep it . I lost a home in Ireland once , and I wo n't lose another . " The pace of the three riders slowed as they neared the ranch house . It was obvious that trouble was expected . Zeke Wooston was a large , untidy man . Only a few years before he had come to California by the Panama route and had been involved in several doubtful business ventures . From the first he had curried favor with Captain Nick Bell , an adventurer who had been appointed commander of the local soldiery by Micheltorena . Micheltorena was a vacillatingman who let his soldiers do as they wished , which to them meant robbing the citizens , drinking and carousing , and much random shooting . California was a long way from Mexico by ship or horseback , and not many soldiers wished that duty , so they had opened the prisons and the army thatp6had come north to California was largely composed of confirmed criminals . Jorge Fernandez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man known for his savage cruelty to horses , Indians , and women . Tomas Alexander owned a cantina on the road to Los Angeles . He was a gambler , smuggler , and bad man with a gun . It was said that he had many friends among the outlaws who hid in the canyons of the Santa Monica mountains . Wooston started to dismount . " No need to get down , " Eileen Mulkerin said . " If you have business , state it . " " Senora , we have ridden far , if  --  " " My door is open to friends and to strangers . You are neither . " " " So that 's how it is ? All right , Senora , we 'll make it plain . You pay up today or get out tomorrow . Go now and you may take your horses and personal belongings . Stay until tomorrow and you get nothing . " " We will pay . " " With what , Senora ? With burned crops ? With a few bales of hides ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The road lies there . Take it . You shall have your money . " Zeke Wooston leaned on the pommel . " Ma'am , we 'll be back tomorrow with our men . If you ai n't gone , we 'll grow you off . " His smile was not pleasant . " And ma'am , I wo n't care what happens to you when you get throwed off . I 'll just leave you to my men . " " That rabble ? You call those men ? " Turning their horses they rode back down the trail . Win Standish watched them go , his expression indicating his worry . " Nothing is solved , Senora . You have only angered them . " " It gives us a little time , just a little more . " " Have n't you a clue about the gold ? "  | " It was Jaime 's secret , and he died with it . " " I can talk to Pio , " Win said after a minute , " but he is out of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor do not see alike . " " Pio is only Pio . He is a good man , a very good man , and he is our friend , but at this moment our enemies have more strength . " Eileen Mulkerin looked toward the sea . From the porch only a narrow triangle of blue water could be seen , and it was empty . There would be gulls flying over that blue water , and driftwood on the beach . She loved to walk the damp sands when the tide first went out , as once she had walked it with Jaime , in their bare feet . She could no longer do that , for she was the Senora . Yet someday she would again . " Sean will come , " she said , at last . " He will find a way . " " If there was a way we would have found it , " Win said , somewhat irritated . " I am afraid the place is lost . " Suddenly she could think of it no longer . Turning , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long since she had permitted herself to cry ? She stood for a minute , looking about , pressing her lips tightly together . How bare the room was ! How different from the rooms back in Ireland ! Any furniture they had must be made on the spot or brought around the Horn by ship , which made it far too expensive . There was a large table , a cowhide settee , two big chairs studded with brass nails , a handwoven rug on the floor , and a chest along the other wall . Over the mantel crossed halberdsthat Jaime had found up a canyon , souvenirs of some nameless battle lost by their owners . Brother Michael followed her in . He sat down again , his loose brown robe giving no hint of the powerful muscles beneath . He had suddenly turned to religion after being known as a wild and somewhat dangerous young man . Hep8never explained why , and nobody asked , respecting his privacy . When he wished to tell them , he would . " We must think , Senora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must take paper and pen and write down every memory you have . The writing will help to bring them to your mind , and among them there may be a clue , some little word , something he brought back . . . it might be anything . " Win Standish sat in one of the chairs . " Senora , I have thought of everything . You have many cattle , but so has everyone , and there is no market except for the hides . We have horses , but so has everyone . To sell the ranch would be impossible even if there was no loan against it . The last place that was sold brought only ten cents an acre .. . everyone has land . " " If it had not been for the fire , " Brother Michael said , " all would have been well . I still think the Senora was right to plant wheat . " " And you had to borrow to buy the seed , " Win agreed . Eileen Mulkerin sighed . " That is past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea , and it was growing beautifully . We would have had the best income ever .. . and then the fire . " Brother Michael dismissed it with a gesture . " Twice father went to the mountains for gold and each time he found it . He must have known where he was going . . . the second time , at least . " " There was never very much . The first time was when you were born , Michael . Times were very bad , and we needed money . Your father took his horse and two others , one a pack horse . " " And a spare horse ? For someone else to ride ? " " Who knows ? Maybe to switch saddles and save the horse he rode . " " How much food ? For a day ? Three days ? A week ? " " For a week , I think . It might have been more , but he would have hunted , too . He always killed game for meat . "  | " A week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do ! " Win said . " I 've borrowed money on the store . I suppose I might  --  " " You have done enough , more than enough . " She looked out over the hard-packed dooryard . Money was hard to come by in California in 1844 . There was food , good beef , beans , all the necessities , but cash was another thing . It seemed that everybody was in the same situation , and now this . She remembered how they had first come to the mountains of Malibu , to this quiet place in the hills . The hills were brown then , so unlike the hills of her beloved Ireland , and more like those of Spain . After they had fled Ireland they had gone to France on a smuggler 's boat , and she had lived there for a few months , and then her father had gone to Spain and sent for his family to follow . He had been involved in a plot to rebel against the British government and it had been discovered . A friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fled . After her father had died in Spain she had come to Mexico to live with an aunt and uncle . It was then that she met Jaime . She had fallen in love with the lonely beaches , with the occasional sea lions on the sand , even with the huge bears they saw from time to time back in the hills . Colonel Mulkerin had always enjoyed hunting , and she had gone with him many times . He hunted only for meat , but few of the Californios hunted at all , and even fewer went into the mountains . On those forays into the hills they often met Indians , and sometimes they met them on the beach . Most of them were the Chumash , a bright , intelligent lot whose plank boats , painted red , often carried as many as twenty people on voyages back and forth to the offshore islands . Their name was not really Chumash , but the first of their tribe to be/come acquainted with the white man were from a group inhabiting San Miguel Island and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them . Eileen Mulkerin walked acrosss to the other chair and sat down . " It was what we wanted , " she said after awhile . " This was just what we wanted but we did not know until we saw it . " The cottonwood leaves rustled in the wind , and she looked out the door at the blue water , so far away . " Until we left Ireland the largest cities I had seen were Dublin and Cork , but after that there was Paris , Marseilles , Madrid , Cordova , and finally Mexico City . When I married Jaime and the presidente gave him this grant to come north , we both knew it was home . " We liked the Indians . They were very quiet and reserved , but when we spoke they always replied . One day we were driving to the pueblo in a cart and we came upon a group walking to the tar pits . We invited them to ride and told them we would take them back with the tar they uses : to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were friends . Often they brought us fish : and just as often , Jaime gave them venison . It was on one of the trips to their camp on the shore with venison that we met Juan . " " Juan ? " Michael frowned . " I do n't remember him . " " It was before you were born . We took the Indians meat and talked to them as they cooked it , but one man sat off by himself , staring at the sea . I asked who he was . He is of another people , ' the Indians said . " His nose was thinner , his skin a bit lighter , his eyes larger , but he was old , very , very old . " " Another tribe ? " Michael asked . " Another people . But he was their friend . We started to ride away , knowing no more about him . He was walking back from the beach . Jaime pulled up and spoke to him . You seem alone . Come to visit us whenever you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . I will . ' " " Jaime waved at the hills , the far , unknown hills . Perhaps you know about them . I would like to know the trails , the people , the villages , especially the places where no men go . It is a beautiful land . ' The old man listened , then walked on without speaking . Two weeks later he was sitting on the beach one morning when we came by . "  |p12Ca|ptain  Sean Mulkerin , of the two-masted schooner Lady Luck stood on the afterdeck staring at the scattered lights of the sleepy village of Acapulco . It was a straggling town of some three thousand people against an exciting backdrop of mountains and forest . Tomorrow , at daylight , they would sail for home , and Sean Mulkerin was for once unhappy at the prospect . He had sailed south with too small a cargo and its sale had not gone well . Hides were a drug on the market and he had gotten rid of them for only a dollar and a half each instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their furs , especially the otter pelts , but they would be lucky even to show a profit after expenses were deducted . He had hoped to bring home enough to pay off the loan on the ranch . Owing to the depths of the harbor , a vessel could lie close in off the sandy beach , so the lights of the town were near . A few scattered houses and two cantinas still showed light , and there was another light at the Spanish fort that once guarded the harbor.  |p13Two  more vessels lay at anchor , one a ship newly arrived from Manila , the other a schooner , three-masted and considerablylarger than the Lady Luck . The night was hot and still with a feeling of impending change in the weather . Leaning on the rail he looked shoreward , an undefined longing inside him , a yearning for something that lay over there , something for him . He had always felt this way in seaport towns , always looked at the lights reflecting upon the dark water and wondered who awaited him there , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps death and a bloody dagger . A man never knew , and that was the thing . A man never knew . Whichever way he turned there might be some haunting mystery , some enchantment . This way might lie love and fortune , and that way shame and death . He straightened up , stretched , and turned away . He was starting for his cabin when a movement caught his attention . Someone was running across the sand toward the water ... it looked like . . . it was . . . a woman . As she reached the water 's edge she threw off her outer garment and plunged into the sea , swimming strongly . Startled , he turned back to the rail , but could see nothing on the dark water . Once he thought he saw the flash of a white arm , and then ashore a door slammed and some called out . There was a shouted question , a reply , then a babble of excited yells , with men rushing back and forth . Suddenly there was a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him . " Unless you wish me to drown , throw me a rope . " It was a woman 's voice , and for an instant he was startled into stillness . Then he turned swiftly to the rope ladder that hung over the side amidships and shook it against the hull so she would hear . " This way ! " he called softly , and she swam along the hull to the ladder.  |p14She  caught hold , began to climb clumsily , and a moment later he helped her over the rail . She shook her long hair , then started to wring the water from it . Her dress had been left behind and she stood in a soaking chemise and pantalets . " Do n't stand there staring ! " she said impatiently . " Get me a coat , or something , and then you 'd better get away from here . " " We are n't sailing until morning , " Sean said , still stunned by the rapid movement of events . " Take my advice and go now or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a lot of explaining . " She nodded toward the shore . " That pack of fools will find my dress and they will search every ship in the harbor . " " That 's all I 'd need ! " he said , and turning sharply he called down the companionway . " Ten ! Pedro ! Congo ! On deck ! " Ten Tennison was first on deck . " Get the anchor in and enough canvas to move her . No lights . I want to move out as quietly as possible . " He ran forward and shook out the jib and by the time he reached the fo'c's'le two men were beside him and the schooner was already moving . Tennison had taken the wheel . " Keep her stern to the town . The longer it takes them to realize we 're moving , the better . " Pedro was sharp and quick and not the kind to waste time with questions . He could hear the tumult and shouting ashore and had no wish to be caught up in what was happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy sailer and took the wind nicely , gliding smoothly through the water . From the shore no perceptible movement could be seen unless someone watched the mastheads against a star . " La Boca Chica , " Sean said , indicating the smaller of the two entrances . The girl had disappeared and he was just as pleased , forp15he had no wish to answer the crew 's questions now . He swore softly , bitterly . The last thing they needed now was to have the schooner seized and her crew in prison . Creating scarcely a ripple , the schooner slid through the three-hundred-yard gap between Point Pilar and Point Grifo and into the sea . Outside there was a good bit of breeze . " Get everything we 've got on her , Ten . We 've got to run foi it . " When the canvas was aloft Ten came aft . " Thought you were n't sailing until daybreak ? " he said , quizzically . With as few words as possible , Sean explained . Tennison was his mate , a fine sailorman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fished the Grand Banks until he longed for broader , warmer seas , and had sailed out to China on the big tea ships . " Who is she ? Some jailbird ? " " Looks and talks like a lady , but I would n't know . I just wish I 'd never seen her and she had n't seen our schooner ! " The wind filled the sails , and the Lady Luck dipped her bows deeper , then rode up out of the water like the dainty ship she was , shaking the water from her . The wind was fair and she laid over a bit . She was an easy craft to handle , and a fast one . Nothing on the coast could touch her unless it was that new schooner . It had more canvas . " Keep her west by northwest , Ten . I 'll go below and see if I can find out what this is all about . " He went down the companionway to the small cabin . She had crawled into a bunk , his bunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck . He stared at her and swore under his breath . Of all the damned fool . . . she was pretty , though . Too damned pretty ! No wonder they had chased her . He turned the light low and returned to the deck . Tennison grinned at him . " You did n't stay long . "  | " She 's asleep . What could I do , Ten ? She swam out to the schooner and came up the ladder . They were hunting her ashore , and they 'd never believe we were n't involved some-how .. ' " You done right . You 'd no choice . " " She 's got no wedding ring on her finger . I saw that much . " He walked forward , trying to think the situation through . He could find no alternative to what he had done . Of course , he could immediately have called ashore and let them come and take her , which would have been neither gallant nor right . She was obviously not a thief . At least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have carried much with her . Ile had no choice but to do as he had done . But , what if this brought more trouble to his family ? If there was some plate he could take her  --  . I here was no place . The sea was picking up and Lady Luck was making good time . California was a long way from Acapulco , and even if they guessed that she had come aboard the Lady Luck there was small chance of them chasing her all that distance . Ile had not planned to sail until daybreak , but who knew that ? And he had no connection with her nor she with him , so it might be some time before anyone tied them together . I le walked aft again . " You 'd better turn in , " Tennison said . " Use my bunk . " 11 e was tired . At four o'clock he must take over the watch from Tennison . Sean Mulkerin went below and dropped on ' rein ' ' soil 's bunk . He was asleep almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a strong sea miming but the Lady was taking it gracefully , as always . The sky was overcast and the deck was wet from a recent sin ver . Congo was at the wheel and Tennison was standing in the stern , looking back at the horizon.  | " See anything ? " Tennison shrugged . " Thought I glimpsed a masthead back there but I was probably mistaken . Even so it might have been some ship headed up the Gulf for Mazatlan . " It was not yet light although the sky was gray along the eastern horizon . With a glance at the canvas , all taut and shipshape , Sean walked to the wheel and glanced at the compass . The run from Acapulco to Paradise Cove was something over fifteen hundred miles , two to three weeks sailing if all went well . If the wind held it could be somewhat less , but the sea had a way of making its own rules . Wind and wave could be understood but not predicted beyond a point . There was always the unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the wheel and he was still there when the girl came on deck . She had contrived a dress from his serape and some pins , and looked incredibly lovely . Her skin was clear and olivetoned , and her hair black . " I am Mariana de la Cruz , " she said , " and I wish to thank you . " I am Sean Mulkerin . " " You are the captain ? And Irish ? " " Yes . My mother is Irish , my father was Irish and Mexican . " " Was ? " " He was killed about a year ago . " " Have you seen anything ? " Her eyes searched his . " I mean is anyone following us ? " " I doubt it . Were you expecting to be followed ? " She thought for a moment , her eyes wide and dark . Then she nodded , " Yes , I believe he will follow . Andres is a very determined man , and not at all a forgiving one . " " Andres ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . "  |p18Andres  Machado ! It would have to be him , of all people . A man fiercely proud , and a noted duelist and fighting man . Yes , he would certainly follow . Whether he wanted this girl or not he would never allow her to leave him . " It was not my choice . . . the marriage , I mean . My father is dead , and Andres arranged it with my uncle . I refused him once , and he did not like that . " We were to be married in Acapulco . Andres ' aunt and her maid were with us , and my uncle was to come down from our ranch . I hate Andres and I could not bear the thought of marrying him . Then I saw you in the plaza . Somebodymentioned who you were , and that you were going to be sailing back to California . " When the maid turned down my bed , she left and I did not think she would be back . It was the only chance I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came back , probably to spy on me " Sean glanced at the compass and moved the wheel a spoke , scowling thoughtfully . He knew a good deal about Machado , and had even been friendly with him at one time . Their friendship ended abruptly when he had beaten Machado in a horse race , but he knew Machado well . Andres came from a good family , but he was a spoiled and arrogant young man who would not be frustrated in anything and who could not accept defeat . Would he follow them ? Of course he would . No doubt about it , and doubly so since he , Sean Mulkerin , was the one involved . Machado would never believe that he had not know Mariana de la Cruz before , that this had not been contrived to make him look ridiculous . The worst of it was that Machado could afford his whims , for he was as wealthy as he was politically powerful . This was trouble , serious trouble , and at such a time when his family needed no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horizon was clear , but at this height above the sea the visibility was only a few miles.  |p19Peo|ple  unaccustomed to the sea always imagined they could see very far indeed , but the distance to the horizon was simply calculated . One took the square root of the eye above the sea , multiplied it by 1.15 and had the approximate distance . If the height of the eye above the sea was nine feet one could see about three and one-half miles . " Hilo , " he shouted to one of the men suddenly , " run aloft and take a look astern . " Hilo , a Hawaiian , scrambled aloft , hesitated only a moment , then called , " A schooner , sir ! Ten or twelve miles off ! " " A two-master ? " " Three , sir . " " Thanks , Hilo . " He glanced at the sea ahead , calculating their chances . Machado had wasted no time . He swore to himself . Then , recalling that Mariana was standing there , he said , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not apologize . I am sorry . I had no idea  --  " " No , you did n't , " he agreed bluntly . " That schooner is undoubtedly the one that lay at anchor in the harbor at Acapulco , and she looked like a good sailer . " " I have gotten you into trouble ! " she said . " I do not mind trouble , " he said , " but at this time trouble for me is trouble for my family . This schooner may soon be all we have . Nothing must happen to it . " If his family were not waiting for him , he would have been tempted to run west for Hawaii , to lose them at sea . He knew many a trick , and if time was no object " I am sorry , " Mariana repeated . " What 's done is done . Now we must see how we can get out of it . " " Machado is a good friend to Micheltorena , the governor of California . " " He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you any more tidbits like that ? " " Only that he is no friend to Pio Pico or Alvarado . " " They are friends of my mother and were friends of myp20father , but that does us no good now . Neither has the power of Micheltorena , nor of Machado , for that matter . " He put the wheel over a few spokes , glancing at the sails . He would head more westerly , try to edge away from the sailing routes to San Diego and points north . He would head for the open sea . All day long they scudded over the sea , a gray-green sea studded with whitecaps . Several times he sent a man aloft and at the last report the other schooner was still headed northwest . If they had been seen , the big schooner was not responding . At supper in the cabin he sat alone with Mariana and put his worries aside . He talked quietly of California , of his brother and his mother , and of Los Angeles , the tiny pueblo toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senora . " She rules us , " he said , smiling a little , " and she is usually right . But you will like her and you can stay with us as long as we have a roof over our heads . " He grinned wryly . " Which may not be long . " " Had n't you better think about that ? You 'll have more time for thinking now than when we 're ashore . " At midnight he returned to the deck , took a sighting on a star , then turned in . Tennison sent Congo for him at four in the morning . Tennison returned to the deck after breakfast and the sea was empty . From the masthead they could see nothing.  |p21From  the starboard bow Captain Sean Mulkerin looked toward the California coast which lay just over the horizon . The big schooner would be over there , beating up the coast , perhaps sailing a little slower to check the coves for hiding places . Sean knew he was postponing the inevitable . Machado was a shrewd man , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the authorities in Los Angeles . A cold wind was blowing on this morning , and the sea was choppy . At twenty-two Sean Mulkerin was a veteran of several years at sea . Born on the ranch at Malibu he had grown up herding cattle , hunting and wandering in the mountains , breaking wild horses , and sailing to the Channel Islands with the Chumash . At fourteen he made his first voyage with his father . They sailed down the coast to Mazatlan , Acapulco , and Tehuantepee . His second voyage , later the same year , was to Panama , Callao , and Valparaiso . Another six months ashore and he was back at sea again , now grown to his full heightp22of five feet and ten inches . This voyage took him to Hawaii , Shanghai , Macao , and Taku Bar . The ship had started for home when it reached Taku Bar and word of rich cargoes in the Moluccas turned them back . From there they had sailed to Samoa and Tahiti before returning home . At sixteen Sean weighed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch and at sea he had grown tough and strong . And at eighteen made his first trip as mate . By that time he was a veteran of dozens of brawls in as many ports . The frequent wars and rebellions in Latin America had spawned a number of privateers sailing under letters of marque from one country or another , most of them with European crews prepared to attack any likely looking ship , whether an enemy vessel or not . The Lady Luck , like many another merchant vessel of the time , was armed . She carried four guns amidships and a Long Tom on the stern . Sean 's first sea fight had occurred on his first voyage , an hour-long battle with a privateer in the Gulf of Tehuantepec . Lady Luck 's amidship guns were below deck , concealedbehind ports invisible from more than a hundred and fifty feet . The privateer , a brig with sixteen guns anticipated no trouble . Ordering Lady Luck to heave to , it closed in rapidly . Jaime Mulkerin had been master of his own ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrun the brig but he needed sea room . Expecting no trouble , the privateers had not manned their guns . They could see the Long Tom astern but no gunner was near it and unless the schooner changed course that gun could not be brought to bear . " Load with canister , " Jaime ordered . " Fire at my word and try to sweep their decks . Reload immediately and aim at their water line . " He stood at the wheel . His crew was six men , and at least forty privateers couldp23be seen on the brig . Slowly the brig drew abreast , and at thirty yards range , Jaime gave the order . The ports flew up , the guns ran out . From the brig there was a shout of alarm , drowned in the boom of Lady Luck 's two starboard guns . The unexpectedblast of fire swept the deck of the other ship . Caught by surprise the brig had no chance to man her guns . The decks were bloody , littered with the dead and dying , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masts . The Long Tom , loaded with solid shot , struck the mainmast , ripped a chunk from it and passed on through the afterdeckhouse . Jaime Mulkerin shook out all of his ship 's canvas and the Lady Luck began to pull away . Standing in the stern Jaime gave a parting wave of his cap . It was his mother who worried Sean now . The Senora was a strong , capable woman , even more so since the death of her husband , and her present difficulty was due more to bad luck than to mismanagement . Some of that bad luck might have been arranged by those who wanted the ranch . There had always been fires along the California coast . The chaparral that cloaked the hills of the southern coast was a thick growth of evergreen shrubs that grew from three to twelve feet tall , with small , stiff leaves and crooked branches closely intertwined to form an almost impenetrablethicket . There was also a variety of scrub oak , manzanita , chamisal , yucca , and mountain mahogany , all highly inflammable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall it was a dangerous combination . Yet scattered among these chaparral-covered hills there were occasional canyons with running streams , their shores lined with valley sycamore , cottonwood , willow and other trees . There were also lovely green meadows , excellent for farming or grazing . The Senora had planted some of these meadows with wheat and corn . Her crops were growingp24splendidly when the fires came , wiping them out . The fires might have been accidental , or they might not . Sean wondered if there could be a way out . For him , of course , there was the schooner . For his brother there was the Church . But what about the Senora ? Since his father 's death the ranch had become her life , perhaps all that was left of her life . At all costs , the Malibu must not be lost . Tennison came forward . " Cap'n ? How do we go in ? " Sean thought for a moment , although his mind had been made up hours ago . He just wanted to review his plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolas Island , " he said , " and outside of Santa Barbara Island . When we come around Santa Barbara we 'll head right for the coast . I want to drop anchor off the kelp and get the canvas off her at once . " " At night ? " " If it works out that way , and I believe it will . If the weather holds we can make it easily , and we 'll just lie up behind Santa Barbara until dark . No lights after that . " When Mariana came on deck the sky was gray and overcast , the sea choppy with a few whitecaps . " What will your mother think of me ? " she asked suddenly . " She will love you . " " Flow can she ? When I bring you only trouble ? " He shrugged . " There is always trouble . One learns to live with it . A man grows through enduring . " " Is that why you go to sea ? " He chuckled . " Of course not . I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody in his right mind invites difficulties , you simply cope with those that do arise . But you do n't try to avoid your duties . As far as the sea is concerned , you learn to live with the sea or you do n't last . You simply try to conform . " " What about people ? Do you conform there , too ? " " Whenever I can , of course . Why not ? Most rules whether of law or good breeding are simply made to enablep25men to live together with less friction . If one lives with people he must always conform , to a degree . I see no harm in that , and lose nothing by it . " He paused , staring off to sea . San Nicolas Island was ahead and somewhat to the west . He looked at it a moment , studyingit thoughtfully . These outer islands had a pattern , and if one learned about them , navigation in the channels was much simpler . The Chumash had told him that the slightest change in color could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was scarcely thinking of them as he looked , for he was thinking of Mariana . For two weeks they had eaten every meal together , had stood watches together , walked the decks together . Was he falling in love ? That was ridiculous , and yetThe Lady Luck was an honest ship , answering easily to the helm and carrying her canvas well . It had never ceased to amaze him how men with good tools were able to shape timber and create something as splendid as a ship . And how a ship , once built , could take on a life and character of its own . How it leaves the land behind , gives itself to the sea , and how the rough timbers become translated into a kind of poetry . Sean said as much to Mariana , and she listened more to the man than to the words . He felt it and was disturbed . He was not quite sure what was the right thing , and he wanted to do the right thing . His years at sea had not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew what proximity on shipboard could do to people and how quickly it could disappear once they were on the beach again . " We 'll be going in , " he said , " as soon as it is dark . " " Is n't that dangerous ? " " Not for us . We 've sailed this coast many times , and I 'd rather they not see us until we 've . met and talked to my family . I want them to have a chance to meet you and un/derstand what has happened . " He hesitated for a moment . " We may have to leave then . Have you any friends up this way ? Any relatives ? " " No . " He hunched his shoulders inside his coat , staring at the rough shoulder of Santa Barbara Island . " Why not let me take you back to your uncle ? " She turned to stare at him . " Do you want me to go back ? " Uncomfortably , he avoided her eyes . " No . Whatever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him he would simply hold me for Andres . They made an arrangement . " He turned away from the subject , thinking about what Machado might do . Would he sail up the coast ? More likely , he would come overland to the ranch , and that could mean a fight . What was Sean doing to the Senora , anyway ? Maybe they should run for it , up the coast to Monterey , and go to Alvarado . He was no longer in power but he had influence , and even the governor would hesitate to invite trouble with him . The schooner moved out from behind the island , caught the wind , and began a run for the coast . Behind them the sun declined , the peaks on the island took on a reddish glow , and the sea grew darker . When Tennison came on deck to relieve him Sean said , " Nothing in sight , but keep an eye open for Indians , some of them may be running in for the coast now . " " Cap'n ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few dollars . If the Senora  --  " " Thanks , Ten . We 'll make out . We need a big chunk , several thousand dollars , and that kind of money is scarce on this coast . " " Do n't you be takin ' that Machado lightly , " Ten said . " He 's killed a half-dozen men in duels , and some of them for little or nothing . "  | " Hold her steady , Ten . If the wind holds we should be up to the kelp by midnight or a little after . I 'll be up to take her in . " The coast lay dark along the horizon now , the Santa Monicas a serrated blackness against the sky and the stars . It was warm and still in the cabin , the brass lamp turned low , swinging gently with the movement of the schooner . " Tomorrow , " he said softly , " tomorrow we 'll be home , and I hope all 's well . "  |p28It  was completely dark when Sean returned to the deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show , and the schooner 's lights had been extinguished . They were moving slower now under a jib and fo'c's'le . There was a light breeze , and the clouds were broken , allowing a glimpse of stars from time to time . Before them the shore was a black , ominous wall . " We 're coming up to the kelp , " Tennison said . " The point is yonder . " A light appeared suddenly atop a ridge back of the point . " There it is , " Tennison muttered . " Your man never misses . " " I hope he never does , " Sean replied , " but tonight we could take her in , anyway . " The light atop the ridge , as both Tennison and Sean knew , was actually in a niche in the rocks that could not be seen except from the sea , and at that only from certain angles . Taking the wheel Sean guided the Lady Luck along the edge of the kelp . The cove was about two miles northeast of the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the point , and a breaking rock closer in . Where he wantedp29to anchor was just outside the kelp with a sand bottom at about seven fathoms . They moved on slowly , and after a few minutes Sean said , " All right , Ten , let go the anchor . " He listened to the anchor running out , timing the chain as it ran through the hawsehole . The crew were furling the sails , and soon the schooner lay under bare poles , her dark green hull lost against the kelp and the shoreline . Tennison came aft again . " Dinghy 's over , Cap'n . You want we should stand by ? " " Do that . If anything develops while I am gone , use your own judgment . If they come after you by boat , take ' em through the kelp . You know where it can be done and they do not . " Congo had dropped a rope ladder over the side . " Your rifle , sah , " Congo 's voice was soft for such a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " I thought you might be needing it , sah . " " Thanks , Congo . " Mariana came on deck , wrapped in her serape . Sean Mulkerin went over swiftly , almost dropping into the bobbing boat . He held the ladder while Mariana came down , showing some caution but no hesitation . She was a girl , he decided , about whom there was very little nonsense , and she could act as swiftly on occasion as he himself . Congo followed , and sat at the oars . He pushed off into the darkness . The water was black , with only a few ripples from the kelp . They could hear the rustling of the surf on the sand . Congo used the oars only to give direction . There was just enough sea running to carry them in . It was very dark and still . Looking up , Mariana saw one lone star peeping through a rift in the clouds . Congo pulled strongly and she felt the bow grate on the sand . Sean leaped over and pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore.  | " Go back , Congo , and thanks . " The big black man shoved the boat into the water , then stepped in . " Cap'n , if you want , I can sure come back . If there 's fightin ' to do  --  ? " " You 'd be the first I 'd call , " Sean said , " and thanks again . Take care of the Lady Luck for me . " A cool wind blew along the sand and they stood together watching the boat , listening to the chunk of the oars in the oarlocks . They walked along the dark beach , pausing from time to time to listen . Sean was wary . He could have chosen to anchor in Dume Cove , which was closer to the ranch house , but if Machado was already searching for them , that was where they would look to find the schooner . " Is it far ? " she asked after a minute . " A few minutes , that is all . You will rest well tonight and the Senora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will hate me . I bring you trouble . " " She will love you . " He hesitated . " Mariana , one thing you should know , and which you will see soon enough . My mother is a very beautiful woman . " " But of course  --  l " " I do not mean she is beautiful because she is my mother , she is simply beautiful . . . and very Irish . She will love you , but she is strong-minded , perfectly capable of holding her own with anyone . " " How does such a strong woman have a strong son ? Often it is otherwise . " " We had a strong father , but they never opposed each other , they worked as a team . It was a revelation to many people . " The cart was there , with one horse . It took shape from the darkness , and then they saw Jesus Montero sitting on the sand close by , a rifle across his knees . " Buenos noches , senor . . . senorita. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was old . To Sean he said , " There is much trouble , senor . They came to take the ranch , and they will come again to-morrow . " " Who came ? " " Senor Wooston , the big one . Fernandez was with him , and Tomas Alexander . " " A pack of thieves . " " There was another one , senor . A man called Russell . " King-Pin Russell , renegade , free-booter , and all-around bad man . A man who would do anything , stop at nothing . " How did Wooston get into this ? " " I know only what I hear . I believe he bought debts from others , threatened them in some cases . I heard from my people that he went to people from whom you had borrowed . Some did not know he was a bad man . Valdez did not . With some he threatened force . " " That sounds like Wooston . . . and Russell . " " Senora waits for you . She has confidence . " Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had brought her only trouble . Yet there had to be something . . . some way ... . On a brush-covered knoll , overlooking the trail up the canyon , Tomas Alexander waited with Russell . " I tell you , Tomas , this here 's no good . He ai n't comin ' . " " There was a rider . A man who comes from the port to the pueblo . He said a big schooner had come in and Mulkerinleft ahead of them , so he should be here . " " We looked in the cove . There was nothin ' . " " He is a shrewd one , Sean Mulkerin is . He knows this coast and might anchor elsewhere . Anyway , " Tomas shrugged , " he might not come in until after dark . " Russell took a pull at his bottle and put it aside . Sitting outp32in these dark hills was not what he considered a good time . He dug out more of a hollow for his hip and then settled down to sleep . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " They come , amigo . I hear a cart . " Russell eased himself forward to a selected firing position . Wooston had said to kill Mulkerin , and that was just what he intended to do . He peered along the rifle barrel , then stopped . " There 's three of them ! " he said exasperatedly . " How do we know which is him ? " " He wo n't be driving , and he has very broad shoulders . " Russell could see the three figures taking shape , suddenly he heard low laughter . " Hell , " he said , " there 's a woman with him ! " " Careful , amigo , " Tomas warned , " if it is a woman it is a lady . He would bring no woman to his mother unless she was a lady . " Russell had been lifting his rifle to fire , but now he hesitated . One could be sure of killing one , and with a bit of luck , two . But the third one ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people who live talk . He relaxed slowly . " A lady ? Who would that be ? " " I do not know , but we must he careful , amigo . They know many important people . The Senora has many good friends , and it could be the wife or daughter of some importantman . If you shoot , she might be hurt . " Russell waited , then withdrew his rifle . He was just as pleased , for he did not like the odds . Suppose he killed the woman ? That could be a hanging offense , and if it was somebodyimportant he would get no help from Wooston . Zeke did not like mistakes . Also , he had no wish to have a live Sean Mulkerin huntingthe chaparral for him . Undoubtedly Mulkerin knew this area better than he ever would , and a man had little choicep33of trails . You could n't push through chaparral very easily , it was all so tightly woven together , and in any case , it would be noisy . Usually you had to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's get out of here . " Tomas hesitated , wanting to go yet not liking the prospect of facing Wooston , a man he feared . Finally he said , " To my cantina . We will have a bottle of wine and talk of this . Maybe there is another way . " Working their way back down the path , they reached their horses . Eileen Mulkerin had been awakened by a voice outside her window . It was Montero 's voice and she had been expectingit . " They are here , Senora , " he said , speaking softly . " They come from the sea . " " Gracias , Jesus . " She lay still for a moment , thinking of her son . He had sailed away with very little , and the market for pelts and hides was always uncertain . She did not expect him to return to her with enough money to pay off what was owed . That was impossible . But just that he be here , to stand beside her , to help her face what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but aloud . " Jaime , I need you . " Sean was like him in so many ways , yet was his own man . She thought again of this son of hers , who each time he returned from the sea seemed somehow older , wiser , more sure of himself , yet different , too . That was what experience did to a man , experience and time . Sean had always been slow to express opinions , carefulin his judgments , and the sea had done that for him also . The sea demands consideration always , no man upon the deep water may make decisions without careful consideration of wind and wave . She remembered Sean telling herp34how the Polynesians could tell when an island lay over the horizon and out of sight by the currents or the condition of the water . She dressed quickly and went into the kitchen . Always at such times her first thought was of food and a warm drink for the traveler . She made coffee from their small stock . Sean liked coffee but they could buy it rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often drank a tea made from ephedra , which she had come to like . She warmed a stew Carlotta had made earlier that day . Coming in at night ? Why ? It was unlike Sean , for as well as he knew the California coast he was a careful seaman , never taking unnecessary risks . Worried now , she went outside and stood in the chill of the night . California was a semidesert land and the desert cools off quickly at night . There was a breeze in from the sea , and she stood there , listening . Somewhere a mockingbird was singing his endless songs , frogs were croaking down by the little creek , but their sounds only emphasized the stillness . As the cart slowly emerged from the darkness , she saw three people on the seat . Jesus was there , and Sean , and a girl . A very beautiful girl.  |p35Sean  got down , then helped the girl down . They turned toward the porch . Sean hugged his mother but before he could speak the girl stepped forward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz , and I am afraid I have brought you trouble . " " Trouble ? Very pretty trouble then . Will you come in ? " Eileen Mulkerin turned to the door , pausing only to say , " Thank you , Jesus . Gracias . " " Por nada , Senora . " " There 's coffee . Will you be seated ? Riding that cart up from the ocean at night is not . . . well , perhaps it is not the best welcome we could offer . " Sean started to speak , but Mariana stopped him . " Let me explain , Senora . I was in trouble . I was being forced to marry a man I did not love , whom I did not wish to marry , and I saw your son and I saw his ship . " I needed help desperately , and he had a strong , kind face , so when night came I slipped away and swam to his schooner . " " Very romantic , " Eileen said , dryly . " And what will your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " Sean replied . " He is Andres Machado . I am afraid I have brought you trouble , Senora , when there is trouble enough . " " Andres Machado . " The Senora smiled a little grimly . " When you decide to make enemies , Sean , you do not pick them easy . " " It was my fault , " Mariana said . Eileen glanced at her , irritated at the new trouble but liking the proud , strong look in the girl 's face . " It was your fault , and my son could have and would have done nothing else , but we have had troubles before and will have them again . You are welcome here . " " If you wish , I can go away . I can find friends . My father had friends in California . " " You may stay here , and welcome . As for your friends , you may need them . I know a great deal about Andres Machado . " Over coffee , they talked of what lay before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael here ? " " He is . " " Then he will have to stay . I do not think they would dare to forcibly eject a man of the Church . " " And what do you expect me to do ? " she demanded . " We must think of that , Senora . This is your ranch . You are in command here . However , we must never yield possession . I know Michael , and he is immovable . If he says he will stay , he will stay . " As for us , it might be better to disappear , to keep out of sight so they can not serve you with papers . " " That does nothing but delay them . " Suddenly Win Standish appeared in the door , Michael behind him . " We heard voices , " Win said . " How are you , Sean ? A good voyage ? " " Only the weather . The hides went for a dollar and fifty cents . We did somewhat better on the pelts . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turning , Sean presented Mariana . His explanation was brief . Win 's face stiffened . " The last thing we want is trouble with Andres Machado . He is a rich , powerful , and vindictive man . If you think we have trouble with Wooston , it will be nothing to what Machado can do . " " We must return her to them , " Win said . " She was betrothed to Machado . It was her father 's wish . " " I will not marry him ! I will die first ! " " It was your father 's wish , " Brother Michael replied gently . " Do you not respect your parents ? " " My father was not concerned . My father is dead . This is my uncle who wishes to be rid of me , and of Andres , who wants a wife for his home . " " She should have something to say about whom she marries , " Sean said quietly . " We can not afford this trouble , " Standish interrupted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go then ? " " One thing at a time , " Sean said . " You are all forgetting the ranch , " Eileen said . " It is the first consideration . " " It has been a bad year , " Win Standish said , " and I have given all I can . " " It has been much , more than enough . You have been loyal , Win . " Eileen spoke quietly . " It was more than we had a right to expect of you . " Jesus Montero sat in a corner twisting his hat in his hands . " There is the old man , " he said , " Juan . He went with Don Jaime to the mountains . " " You mean , " Win turned on him , " when the colonel found the gold ? " " It was not much gold , " Montero said , " only a little bit . However , it was enough . " " I have never believed in the gold , " Standish said . " Nobodyhas found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , " Sean replied . " There was a vaquero who found some in one of the canyons . It was a few nuggets clinging to the roots of a wild onion . There is gold . " " Stories ! " Win scoffed . " Just stories ! " " Do you know the mountains , Montero ? " Eileen asked . " Who knows them ? Nobody . Not even the Indians know them . When you ride into them and think you know them you come back later and they have changed . My people do not go to the mountains , Senora . " " But you do know where the old man is ? " Montero shrugged . " Perhaps . Who can say ? He comes and he goes and if he does not wish you to see him you do not see him . I have not seen him since a year before Don Jaime died . He may be dead now . . . or gone . " " Gone ? " " They disappear sometimes , the old ones do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows where they go ? One day they are here , and the next they are gone . " " The old man , Montero ? Can you take me to him ? " Sean asked . " I can try . If he is alive and wishes to be found , we will find him . If he does not wish it , we will not . " " What kind of Indian is he ? " Michael asked . Montero shrugged . " Who knows ? Some say he was one of those who named the land , those who were here before the Chumash and are gone now . " Who knows what Malibu means ? Latecomers have tried to say it means where the mountains meet the sea , but it is not true . Nobody knows . . . nor Mugu . . . nor Hueneme . The names were given long ago to the land , and the people who gave them are gone . All but this old man . " " Have you seen him , Sean ? " Michael asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boy I met him near Sandstone Peak . He talked to me . . . for a long time . "  | " You never told me of that , " Eileen protested . " What did he say ? " " It was something he was teaching me . A lot of words . He got up and left very suddenly , but before he left me he stopped to say , wisdom must be shared , it must be given , or else it lies cold upon the rocks . I would give you my wisdom , young one . ' " And did he ? " " A little , I think . I saw him only once more before I went off to sea . He talked to me again , for a long time . " " He is a strange one , " Michael agreed . " The Indians will not speak of him . Whenever I have tried to learn from them who or what he was , they have avoided my questions . " " They probably just do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's just an old man who lives alone . " Eileen looked at him . " Win , you 're the best nephew a woman ever had . . . but you 're not Irish . " " What has that to do with it ? " Standish asked , a bit irritated . " Possibly nothing , " she agreed , smiling , " but the Irish are an ancient people , and they do not deny another world . " " Heaven ? The Hereafter ? " Win said . " Neither do I. I am a churchgoer . I believe in a Heaven and Hell . " " That is n't what I mean , " Eileen Mulkerin said , " I mean we Celts are not inclined to be overly skeptical about the Little People , or the mysterious . Ireland was a haunted land , but the ghosts were friendly there , most of them . " " " Senora , " Standish said , " I can not understand you . Most of the time you are one of the most practical , sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but sometimes  --  " She smiled again . " But sometimes I am Irish , is that it ? " " Can you take me to Juan , Jesus ? " Sean asked . " Who knows ? I will try . " " Tomorrow , then . Very early . "  | " What of Wooston ? " Michael suggested . Sean shrugged . " Your problem , Michael . You are a strong man , a sane man , and you are of the Church . If I am here either they or I might become impatient of words , but you can speak , and you are not expected to be violent . " Let them stay if they insist , but you must not go ! Stay ... do not give up possession . That is most important . " " I will go , and  --  " " I shall go with you , " Eileen Mulkerin said quietly . " It is my ranch , and Juan knows me also . We will both go . " " And I , " Mariana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion aside with some impatience . " It will be a long ride , a hot , hard ride , and we do not know what will happen nor where it will end . " " You seem to forget , Captain , that Andres will come . He will take me by force , and if you do not want Brother Michael to resist and be killed . . . for Andres would not hesitate , believe me . " " She can ride with me , " Eileen said . " She will be company for me , and I do not think she will wilt or fall by the way . " " I grew up on a ranch . I could ride a horse as soon as I could walk . " " This is ridiculous ! " Standish protested . " Senora , what are you thinking of ? Riding off into the hills after some namelessold Indian who knew your husband ! " He probably knows nothing ! In any event , your husband brought home very little gold . Do n't you think he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the old man may be dead . " " Can you suggest an alternative ? " the Senora asked quietly . " Win , I know how you feel , but I know of nothing else we can do . Twice before the gold saved us , and maybe it will on this occasion . If we do not do this , what do we do ? Give up the ranch ? Or turn these hills into a bloody battle/ground ? I will die here , Win Standish , rather than give up a single acre ! " " Oh , all right ! Go if you must ! " He hesitated . " Will you be all right , Michael ? I 'd like to ride in and talk to Pio . Maybe there is something he can do . . . or suggest . He is a wise man . " " There 's no use asking how long you will be gone , " Michael said , " but whatever the time , I shall be here . Have no fear about that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lying at Point Dume , in the cove beside it , or up the coast . You know where . I have told him to preserve the Lady Luck at all costs . He will be ghosting off shore if not in close , so a signal will call him . " " I will be all right , " Michael said quietly . " And pray , " Sean said . " I think we will need your prayers ... the more the better . " " You do not pray , Sean ? " Michael suggested gently . Sean grinned . " I 'll be praying , do n't worry about that ! But I am afraid prayers from my lips wo n't have the appeal yours will . " Sean went to his room and stripped off his shirt and bathed in the basin , pouring cold water from the pitcher . It was good to be back , even at such a time . The bare , whitewashed walls of his room were home . He could hear faint sounds in the other rooms as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Jesus . " I think we will be watched , " he said , " and followed . " " By Russell ? " Montero shrugged . " By Russell , or by Tomas . . . somebody . After I show you , I shall come back to be with Brother Michael . " " Thank you . I would like that . " Montero closed the door and squatted against the wall.  |p42His  eyes were very black . " I did not know the Old One had talked with you . If he did so you are chosen . " " What does that mean ? " Montero did not reply for a moment . " They say of him that he was the last of his people , that they were a great people who came here from afar . They say that once there was a city in the desert , a very great city of adobe and stone and it existed for many lifetimes , and then one night there was a great shaking of the earth and after many days it continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people . . . only a handful . . . and Juan , the Old One . " " It 's a good story , Montero , but I doubt it . Pedro Fages came up through this country long ago and he spoke of no city . There were others along the coast a hundred years before him , at least . I think it is only a story . How old can Juan be ? Is he seventy ? Eighty ? " " He is old , Senor , very , very old . Who can say how old ? Can you put a time to his years ? I can not . The oldest men of the villages can not . There was a Chumash who lived on San Miguel . He was very old , and he told me that when he was a child Juan looked as he does now . Who knows , Senor ? " Are you ready to say what can and can not be ? I am not . I am a humble man , Senor , yet I have ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south and seen many things . My people call me a wise one . . . a maker of magic . . . but to him I am a child , Senor . I , who am a proud man , confess it . " You measure time , Senor . I have seen the brass clock on your ship . You are very careful to measure time , and perhapsthis is the white man 's fault . . . that he tries to measurethe immeasurable . That he tries to put chains upon the unchainable . What is time , Senor ? Who can say ? You count footsteps when you measure land . You count sun and moons and the seasons , but what does it tell you ? Do you know , Senor , I think you do wrong to count these things . " I think they are . I think time is . I do not think time passes ,  |p43as  you say . I think time is here , that it never began , can never be measured , and will always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across because that is what you believe the world to be , but perhaps there are others who walk up and down and across but also walk through . " " Through ? Through what ? " Montero got to his feet . Carefully , he brushed his sombrero . " There is always tomorrow . Now I shall sleep . " " Jesus ? " Montero had lifted the latch on the door . " Si , Senor ? " " You have talked to the Old One , too ? " " A little , Senor , only a little . Not as he will talk to you . Buenos noches , Senor . Hasta la vista . " The door closed softly behind him and Sean sat down on his bed and pulled off a boot . He dropped it to the floor , then took off the second and held it in his hand , thoughtfullyrubbing his foot . Then carefully he placed the second boot on the floor . Would someone lie awake waiting for the second boot to be dropped ? Were there always two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be ? Or is that merely a way we have of looking at the world so it is comfortable to live in ? He lay back on the bed , blew out the candle , and closed his eyes.  |p44Although  the hour was early the heat was intense in the narrow canyon . Montero led the way , followed closely by Eileen Mulkerin and behind her , Mariana . They were followed by a couple of packhorses and then Sean . The horses plodded slowly for the trail was winding and difficult . There was no breeze in the canyon . Several times they saw cattle , wilder than the deer . One magnificent red bull , head up , nostrils flaring , glared at them trying to decidewhether to charge , but as they kept on their way , ignoring him , he snorted , threw up his tail , trotted a couple of yards after them , then tossed his head and went off over the hill . All was still . They heard no sound but the hoofs of their horses and the occasional buzzing of bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slowly and by midmorning they were no more than ten miles from the ranch . Several times Montero had dropped back to dust over their tracks , doing so each time they passed a branch canyon . Sean rode with his rifle in his hands . At this point he wasp45expecting no trouble but was aware that it could come at any moment . His life in the mountains , the desert , and at sea had sharpened his senses until alertness was a way of life . At sea he had learned to sense the slightest change in the movement of the ship through the water , the creak of the rigging , or the slap of a sail . Yet having grown up herding cattle , riding the range in the rough desert mountains of southern California , one of the greatest cattle raising areas in the world at the time , he knew the wild country in all its moods . Montero reached a widening of the trail and stopped to let the horses catch a breath . Sean rode to the head of the column . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . no sooner . It is not far to where the trail branches , a short distance only . We will take the left . " " Is n't that Saddle Rock Peak ? " He indicated a clump of rocks atop a low peak some distance off to their right . " I have not ridden this way in a long time . " " It is Saddle Rock . . . and as close as we come . We ride north and a little east . " Sean dismounted and walked his horse back into the shade , seating himself on a rock near the women , who had also gotten down to rest their horses . " Will he stop to eat ? " Mariana asked . Sean grinned at her . " Hungry ? No , I do n't think he will . . . yet . He 's heading for a place where there 's water . Dry as these hills are , there 's water if you know where to find it . Montero has handled cattle in these hills long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Only the old Indians know all of them . " He gestured . " Lobo Canyon lies yonder . I killed my firstp46lion over there . Nine feet long he was and crouched on top of a boulder trying to decide whether I was dangerous or not . I was twelve then , and I guess he decided I was pretty small stuff . His tail was lashing . . . getting set to jump .. . so I shot him . " Once more they started on , following a dim trail westwardtoward the highest peak in the immediate area , a blunt sandstone shoulder that was part of a long ridge that ended in another bold peak to the west and south . Suddenly Montero turned north and began to follow a still dimmer trail that seemed to be leading up the sandstonepeak itself . Several times Sean saw the tracks of sandals here , and recognized them as those left by the Old One . He was alive then . The old man was not dead . He felt a curious excitement as well as relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man had passed on . How long since he had seen him ? It had not been for a long , long time ! The growth thinned out , everywhere there was sandstone . How , he wondered , did the old man live ? Where did he get water ? What did he eat ? Why had he not come down to the ranch where he would have been welcome at any time ? Suddenly they were in a nest of smaller peaks almost atop the ridge . There were some trees here and some brush that was suddenly of a deeper green . They rounded a boulder into a small clearing and there before them , built against the wall of sandstone , was a small hut of woven branches . Part of it woven from still living , growing trees . On a bench at the door sat Juan , the Old One . He looked incredibly old , unbelievably frail . He wore a straw hat , a worn serape of many colors , and handwoven sandals . " How do you do , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have been long in coming . " " You have been waiting ? " Eileen asked  | " Of course . Your husband said that if anything happened to him I was to tell only you . . . or the boy . " He looked at Sean . " The boy is a man . It is good . " He waved a hand . " Will you be seated ? My home offers little . " They dismounted . Montero led the horses into the shade , then returned and squatted on his heels and began to smoke a thin cigar . Sean put a hand on Mariana 's elbow . " Old One , this is Mariana de la Cruz . She is from Mexico . " The dark eyes turned to her . " Ah ? Of course . I was there once . . . as a boy . A beautiful city , but not what I had expected . We were told it was an island in a lake , but there was no island and not much left of the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man went within . When he returned it was with a pitcher of something cold and he filled a small clay cup for each . " It is an old drink , made of chia and honey . It is cooling .. . and it gives strength to the muscles . " " We are in trouble , Juan , " the Senora said gently . " Men would take the ranch from us if we do not pay . We thought you might know where my husband found the gold . " " Yes . I know you are in trouble , and I know you came about the gold . I will tell you , and then you must go . You are followed . Eight men follow you . They would kill you , all of you . " " You will come with us ? " " I will come . You could not go alone . " He looked at Sean . " And once we have gone , only you may ever come back for gold . Remember . . . only you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , Old One . " " Gracias . " The old man turned to Eileen . " You do not change , Senora . You are as one of us . " " Us ? " she asked gently . He smiled , amusement stirring the wrinkles at the cornersp48of his eyes . " My people are gone now , Senora , but once we were many . Never so many as you , never so many as most peoples , but enough . " " Your people did not age ? " " All men age , as all men die . The thing is not to die too soon , Senora , and to live wisely . To live a long time is nothing , to live a long time wisely is something . " " You speak well . You are a strange man , Old One . " " I believe unfamiliar is the term , Senora . " He paused a moment , watching Montero come up from the rocks behind the hut leading a fine buckskin horse . " Until your husband came I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a voice to reply . The Chumash were a good people , very bright and quick , but their experience was only with our land here . Your husband was a man who had traveled in ideas as well as upon trails and the sea . He listened well , he talked well . He understood much . His was a wide mind , given to acceptancewhere others might have denied . " " You are an educated man , Old One . " " What is education but a conditioning of the mind to a society and a way of life ? There are many kinds of education , and often education closes as many doors as it opens , for to believe implies disbelief . One accepts one kind of belief but closes the mind to all that is , or seems to be con-tradictory . " Sean was sitting forward , all his attention upon the old man , everything within him suddenly alive . What was it the old man had said to him , those times long ago ? He did not remember what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew now he had never been the same since , that he would never be the same again . " You said something once about wisdom , " he said . " That it must be shared . I would share yours , Old One . If you will talk , I will listen . " " Yes . I will speak . But it is important to listen with all the senses , and to feel . Awareness is a way of learning , too . Inp49these days to come you must be alive and aware to everything . Let the days leave tracks upon your memory . " Suddenly he turned away and walked to the buckskin horse . He gathered the reins , put a hand on the pommel and swung easily to the saddle . He motioned to the others to mount and follow him . Without another word he started along the ridge , then crossed over to the north side . There seemed no trail beyond that point , but he led on . He turned in his saddle and spoke to Sean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear . " Do not forget the way . I am soon to die . " " No . " " Soon . " Sean glanced at his mother . Her cheeks looked gaunt , a little tired . It was the same with Mariana . " Can you make it ? " " Of course , " the Senora smiled . " Can you ? " Sean laughed , and Mariana smiled back at him . " Ride on , " she said , " you will not leave us behind ! " The wind blew off the sea , and although the sun was hot , the wind kept them cool . At times they rode in the shade of sandstone cliffs , at other times under trees . Twice Sean saw the tracks of grizzlies , different from other bears by the long claws on the forepaws . Once he saw the track of a mountain lion and several times of bighorns . The old man led them down a narrow , switchback trail . This was an old trail now , into which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past huge boulders where water dripped . There were many birds , all chirping at once . " Water here , " the old man said . " It is far . " There were a few minutes of respite in the cool shade where the water fell , it was a lost place , a cool , pleasant place away from the hot sun . Soon the old man mounted again . " How far ? " Sean asked . The old man merely said , " To the end . To where we go ,  |p50and  it will be like places you have seen , but unlike places you know . " Sean dried his palms on his shirt front and looked down into the deeper canyon . It was nondescript , offering no landmarks . This was a trail that would be easy to lose . The old man was right . One must be aware . Mariana rode beside the Senora at a place where the trail was wide . " He does not sound like an Indian . " " What is an Indian ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Iroquois . " " I like him . " " Yes . " They separated as the trail narrowed , drew togetheragain when it widened . " Did you notice that he said nothing when he found we were coming along ? He did not even suggest we be left behind . " " He knew better , " Eileen said dryly , and then added , " but it is true . Obviously the equality of women has never been an issue among his people . . . or so it would seem . " Topping out on a rise , Sean looked back , mopping the sweat from his forehead . He could see nothing behind him but sandstone heights and shimmering heat waves . Were Machado and his men following ? The Old One had said they were , and in his heart he believed it himself . Perhaps one did not always have to see or hear to know . Perhaps one just knew . Was that how the old Indian did it ? Even Montero , at times . Was there something on the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns in the air that traveled on until felt by someone attuned to them ? He shrugged . His hand went back to his belt where his pistol was . It was a new-style repeating pistol made in Paterson , New Jersey , and designed by a man named Colt . It was a good pistol , the best of them so far , and called a " long nine " by the man who sold it to him , a man who was broke in Panama . At the same time Sean had bought his rifle , an eight-shotp51Colt revolving rifle , and a good one . He had himself tinkered with it a little , setting the sights a bit finer and improving the mechanism . It was good to be back in the saddle again , and the mustanghe rode was a sure-footed mountain horse brought up from Mexico . Several times he glanced back , and once , far away on the sandstone ridge , he thought he caught a flash of sunlight on something metallic . It could have been his imagination . The sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a spring in the Potrero . " Water your horses and fill your canteens . We 'll make a dry camp . " " We 're going further ? " Sean was worried about his mother and Mariana . " Only a mile or two . Tomas might know of this spring , although I doubt it . " They let the horses drink deep , then rode away in the gathering darkness . Their camp was a hidden place in a niche of the hills . There was soft sand there ; Sean kicked away a couple of stones and spread blankets for his mother and Mariana . " Better get some sleep . We 'll be moving on at daylight . " He watched as Montero led the horses to a patch of grass and picketed them there , then sat down on a rock and looked at the stars . Tonight the old man was not talkative , and after a few minutes Sean saw Montero returning . " I will watch , " Montero said . " Sleep while you can . " " Call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point near the women , who were already asleep , he rolled in his blanket with his weapons beside him and stretched out . He tried to sleep , but for a while sleep would not come . The stars seemed very near , very bright . The night was soft as a maiden 's touch , and there was only a suggestion of a breeze.  |p52He  heard a pebble fall among stones , the brief stirring of some small animal and when next he awakened Montero was beside him . He sat up quickly . " What is it ? " " I am sleepy , amigo . It is time for you to watch . " Sean shook out his boots carefully . He had no desire to put a foot into a boot with a tarantula or scorpion in it . Then he stood up , shook out his blankets , rolled them behind his saddle , and taking up his rifle , listened to Montero . " It is quiet . I do not believe they are close , but be careful . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californio Indian would come near us when the Old One is along . . . and they know he is here . I ca n't answer for raiders from across the Colorado , the Mohaves or Paiutes from the north . " An hour passed , and then another . Sean circled the camp several times , checked the horses , and then returned to the campsite . He had seated himself on a rock when his mother joined him . " I am awake , Sean , if you wish to sleep . " " It is all right . I slept well . " " We must save the ranch , Sean . Somehow it must be saved . " " We will . " " I know . " She sat down near him . " Mariana is a lovely girl . " " Yes . " " You are in love with her ? " He chuckled . " There 's been no time for romance . Too much to worry about . She is lovely , though , and if the ranch were free and clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be with us for a long while , Sean . " He said nothing , listening into the night . There seemedp53a sudden , heavier stillness . He waited , expecting he knew not what . He glanced at his mother . She was sitting a little straighter , looking down the valley toward the spring . " Somebody is coming , " she said.  |p54Suddenly  Juan was near them . " Come , we will go now . " Montero had brought their horses , and once mounted Juan turned sharply away from the way they had come and led them into what appeared to be a solid wall of chaparral , higher than their heads . There was , in fact , a trail . The brush closed in on either side , the leaves brushing their knees and stirrups , sometimestheir shoulders . Juan wasted no time . The old man led the way into the tangle like a young vaquero after an old mossyhorn steer . In single file , they followed . Weaving and winding through the dark passage , able to see no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the small sounds of their passing . At a small clearing in the brush the Old One pulled up long enough for Montero to drop back to the rear , then they moved on . Suddenly , Sean realized the air was growing lighter . . . the moon was rising . Emerging from the brush they dipped into a deeply shadowed canyon . Juan held his pace . Above them thep55mountains loomed , dark and mysterious , and before them the canyon was black , showing nothing . After an hour of riding they emerged into a wide , moonlit valley , but the old man wasted no time , riding out into the valley and pointing the way diagonally across it . Here the grass was brown and parched . There was dust , and silence . For two miles or more they stayed with the valley , then pointing at a rocky tower before them they skirted it and entered a narrow draw . Steadily they rode and suddenly emerged from the draw into a wide place where there were cottonwoods , an old adobe house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will stop here , " Juan said , " for one hour of rest " " I will ride back and watch the valley , " Montero said , and was gone . Sean helped his mother from the saddle , although she needed none of it . " Help yourself , " she said , " I have ridden further than this . " " We have further to go , " he said quietly . " What do you know ? Juan will tell us . " " It is further ? " Mariana asked . The old man smiled . " Three days , if all goes well . Possiblyfour . You will come ? " " Of course , " Eileen Mulkerin said . " Did you think we would stop ? " " Can we have coffee , Old One ? Or is a fire dangerous ? " " It would be good . " " He squatted on his heels near a rock . " They will not find where we have come until daybreak , I think . The path through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sean said carefully , " one of those who rides with Tomas once rode with Vasquez , the outlaw . He knows the trails . " The old man looked up . " There are some trails a man can ride that can be ridden by no other . Let them follow if they dare . "  |p56Sean  made a small fire and got a coffeepot from a packhorse . In a few minutes he had water boiling . Eileen took over then and made the coffee , and he walked out away from their group to listen . It was very quiet . The Old One knew what he was doing , but Sean liked none of it . Tomas Alexander 's cantina was a stopping place for all who rode through , and many were outlaws from the gangs of Vasquez or one of the several Joaquins . Tomas knew the back trails himself and had men with him who knew , too . If caught out in these lonely hills where Californios rarely came , they would hesitate at nothing . Juan was unarmed , Montero had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colt revolving rifle like his own . Mariana was not armed . In a fight it would be Montero , his mother , and himself . Machado would have Russell , Tomas , and others . To avoid a fight was the logical conclusion , and that was what Juan seemed inclined to do . Eileen Mulkerin stood by the campfire and studied her son . Somehow it seemed odd to think of him in that light , for in many ways this broad-shouldered young man was a stranger to her . Michael , for all his youthful wildness , had always been closer to home . It was Sean , the steady one , who had gone out upon the deep water with Jaime and with others , and who had come back to her from time to time , stronger , more assured , and with a ringing voice of command that startled her at times . Yet he had a vein of something else , too . Some might have said it was the sea except for the fact that it was the same quality , a strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jaime had had it too , and she did herself . It was Celtic , deep within them all , yet deeper and stronger in Sean perhapsthan in any of them . Montero had mentioned it oncep57when he was speaking of Sean as a boy . Old Juan had seen it , too . What were the things that made up a man ? Was it only hard fists and a salty way ? Was it a strain of gentleness , a love of the land ? Or was it so much else ? In these last hours of the night she looked again at the sky , growing faintly pale now along the eastern rim of the mountains . A few stars still hung in the sky like distant harborlights , and the blackness in the deepest canyon remained . She crossed to where the old man sat , and he looked up as she approached . He started to rise , but she gestured for him to stay . " I will sit , " she said . Juan looked older , even quieter if that was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , Juan ? " " There will be blood , " he said quietly , " blood and death . You should not have come . " " Since when was a woman afraid of blood ? " she asked . " The problem is not only Sean 's . It is mine also . If there is to be blood , I will share in the letting or the losing of it , " He shook his head . " There is no end . Man was born in travail , and in travail he lives . " " This place to which we go ? Will there be safety there ? Shelter ? " " There is no safety upon this earth , and no shelter but for a time . There was once a time when my people had shelter , and in a night , it was gone , and in the days and weeks that followed there was not even a stone laying upon a stone that was not shaken down . " We lived in a world of our making . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed ourselves secure . We were not secure . " We had wisdom of a sort . We knew not the things you and your people know , but we knew much else that you do not know , perhaps can not know , yet it was of no use . The earth trembled and cracked and dust arose , and there wasp58fire , and my people fled , fled they knew not where . Some went to the sea and died there in great waves that followed the fifth week of trembling , and some went to the desert and died of thirst , and many lay dead in the ruins of all we had built . " A few of us went to the mountains . Some of us lived . Many died because they knew not how to live without all they had had about them . I was young . I was a priest among them , but I was also one who loved the wild lands and often went out to search for herbs for medicines , so I lived . " " I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering . " Did you ever tell Jaime of this ? " " A little . He found a wall once , in the desert , and beside the wall some broken bits of a pot . It was thin , fragile , beautiful . He wondered how a Chinese pot could come here and was surprised when I told him the piece was not of China , but a fragment of our own . We talked a little then . " " And Sean ? Does he know of this ? " The old man was silent for several minutes , and then he said , " He knows much by himself . He perceives . He feels . He knows where something has taken place , where things have been . It is something deep within him . " " You taught him something when he was much younger ? " " Taught ? Perhaps . All teaching is not instruction , sometimes it is only opening a door or lifting a veil . Lift the veil and one does not need to teach for the mind sees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will my son survive the blood-letting ? " " I do not know , Senora . Once I was young , and I knew many things , but now the light burns low and what I perceive is but dimly as through a curtain . " " And your city ? The place from which you came ? Your people ? Who were they ? "  | " Another people . . . it does not matter now . I am the last of us , I believe , and I am old , so very old . " " But where did you come from ? " " Elsewhere , but long , long ago . It does not matter , Senora , and I speak of this to no one . " " Not even to Sean ? " " Not yet . . . soon , perhaps . But only a little . The past is gone . My people who were proud and strong and fierce went down as does the grass before the fire . We were once here , and there was dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You should tell someone what you know . There should be a history , so that men can learn from it . " He smiled . " Men do not learn from history . Each generationbelieves itself brighter than the last , each believes it can survive the mistakes of the older ones . Each discovers each old thing and they throw up their hands and say See ! Look what I have found ! Look upon what I know ! ' And each believes it is something new . " We had them in plenty , the new discoverers , exclaiming with excitement over what we had long ago tested and found false . We had the greedy ones , too , and those who wished for power or to show power . They are gone now , with all the rest . " Once a priest talked to me . He spoke long of the sins of this world and wished me to declare for his god that all my sins be remitted . I listened to him patiently and smiled inside for I had no sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me of Sodom and Gomorrah , and I listened and felt a sadness upon me , for what had happened to us had happened there also . " The last of the stars had disappeared . The old man got to his feet . " We must go now . I do not know how , but they have found a way and they are close . . . much too close . " She went to Sean . " Juan says they are coming , and he says there will be blood . "  | " I have been expecting it . " Once more they merged with the beginning day , lending their movements to the vanishing shadows and the growing light , riding along the faces of slopes like cloud shadows under the sun , and leaving no mark upon the land they left behind . Sean dried his hands on his shirt again and turned his head to look at the hills behind them . Nothing . . . yet . He knew it was coming and rode warily , sitting light in the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground if need be . He wanted no wasted shots , no galloping horse beneath him . He could shoot from the saddle , and had done it many times , but this time he must be sure , and with each shot a man must fall . His mother was here , and Mariana . The old man set a killing pace . On through the sunblastedhills he rode , winding up on the long slopes , along the ridges and into strange canyons . He waded their horses through streams , pushed through thickets , turned and doubled and changed his direction again and again . Once , far back , Sean thought he saw dust , but Juan shook his head . " I do not know what dust that is , but it is not theirs . They are closer . They simply do not see us . " Sean saw , once in a while , a deer track . He saw no others . Yet within the last mile or so the terrain had suddenly changed , for he was weaving a way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust sharply upward , the edges only beginning to be worn by wind and blown sand . It was a nightmare of broken ledges , twisted rocks , deep gorges , and desolation . He spoke of it to Montero . " It is a great crack , " the Mexican said , " a crack in the earth that cuts through the mountains for many miles , from Mexico to the sea far north of Monterey . At places the trail follows the bottom , and I have ridden it . "  | " An earthquake fault , " Sean commented . " I 've heard of such places . " It was dark when again they stopped , and Juan drew up and got stiffly down . " Do not unsaddle . We will make coffee , eat , and ride on . " " Tonight ? " Mariana was incredulous . " We must . " When they had eaten and had drunk their coffee , Juan got more slowly to his feet . Sean looked at him , suddenly worried . " Perhaps we should rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These days I am often tired . It is no matter . " " But a little rest  --  ? " " There is no time . They come quickly . " As Sean moved to put out the fire , the old man stopped him . " No , add wood , and leave it burning . They will believe that we are here . They will get down , creep up , and find nothing . Nothing at all . " " And so ? " " We shall have gained a few miles , perhaps a whole night . It is a difference , amigo . " Wearily they mounted , and wearily Juan led them into the night , into the darkness.  |p62It  was daylight before they again stopped . The place was a canyon with towering walls that went steeply up , then sloped back . There were junipers there , and pinon pine . " We will rest , " Juan said . He squatted against a boulder . " We can not go on . They are too close . " " Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I know . " " We must have the gold , Juan . We will lose the ranch . " " Is it so important ? It is land , but there is much land . If you lose that , go elsewhere and take more . I can show you more land , finer land . " " It is our home . The mountains are there , and the sea . Our schooner is there . The grave of my father is there . " " Ah , yes . I had forgotten that . " He paused , then said , " They are too close . They will find us and they will take it all . " " They will take nothing , " Eileen Mulkerin said flatly . " They will take nothing , Juan . They will get nothing but trouble . I will not lose the place , Juan . I will not lose it , do you hear ? "  | " Those men who follow ? They are bad men ? " " The worst . " Eileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is King-Pin Russell , Tomas Alexander , and Jorge Fernandez . " " Fernandez ? A thin , hard man ? " " Si . . . and there is Andres Machado . " Juan stirred the sand with a stick . " This Fernandez .. . I know of him . He killed a girl , I think . An Indian girl ? " " He is the one . " " She was known to me . Sometimes she brought me frijoles . . . she was a good girl . " He sat silent , then shook his head . " No . I can not . You are my friends . I know that . But this is not what you think . It is no great treasure , but only a little gold , not easily had . For you there might be enough . . . but I can not risk it . " Sean squatted , too . " Old One ? Take them . I will stay here . I will be sure that no one follows you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have killed them . You take the Senora and . Mariana . . . go . I will stay . " " If you stay , " Montero said , " I will stay with you . " The Old One looked from one to the other , slowly shaking his head . " You are brave men , good men . " He paused again , then sighed and shook his head . " Rest a little then . Let the horses roll , take them to drink in the hole beyond the bushes . We must go soon . " He moved away from them and , curling up in a shadow , went to sleep . Eileen Mulkerin looked at her son . " We should not do this , Sean . I think the place he is taking us to is very special . Possibly a sacred place . " " You are probably right , and I am worried for him , but what I have said , I will do . You ride on with him . I shall stay . " " We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  " " No . I have spoken . That is how it will be . I love the ranch , but the ranch is not worth my son 's blood . I say no . . . all go , or none . " He knew better than to argue . " What about the gold ? " he asked . " Was it melted down or was it ore ? " " I never saw it . " Montero led the horses away and Sean leaned back against a rock . He was tired , very tired . The long voyage , the worry , and now this . His eyes closed . He opened and shut his fingers , closing them into fists . Somehow , somehow he must save them all . Juan , his mother , Mariana . Montero ? He was a good man , and together they would do what must be done . They were men , and they would stand together . What happened remained in the hands of God . . . or destiny . Suddenly he felt a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high in the sky , and the hand was Juan 's . " You sleep well , my son . It is time to ride . " " Could you not tell us where to go ? You could hide nearby and rest . " " The road I travel is one of memories . It is good for me to go . " " My husband had much respect for you , " Eileen Mulkerinsaid . " He was a good man , Senora . He had respect for the old ways and when the old gods spoke to him , he listened . " " The old gods ? " " They are here , in all the quiet places . If you are silent in the wilderness they will , in time , come close to you . If you respect their world they will come to love you . " Those who follow us , they know not what they do . " Juan glanced at her . " You are known to the Old Ones . They know you belonged to him , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not know me , Juan , or you wouldnot say that . I am a hard , bold , demanding woman . " He shrugged . " You know to be silent in the wilderness . It is that which matters , to learn to live with silence . " He walked to his horse . " It is time now . We must go . " Andres Machado was in the lead when they reached the place of the fire . He rode quickly around , then back . Russell followed him . " This was the smoke we saw . What do you suppose it was for ? " Machado shrugged . " Coffee . " He swung down from the saddle , a lithe man , easy in his movements . " We will have some o- : delves . " He turned . " Silva ! We will have food now . " " It was a signal , " Silva muttered . They all looked at him . " A signal ? To whom ? " He shrugged . " They cooked . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied cup . But it was a signal , too . " " Who could he signal to ? " Alexander asked , impatiently . " There is nobody out here , Silva . Not even Indians live in this wilderness . " " It was a signal , " Silva insisted . " What about that old Indian ? " Wooston asked . " I only saw him once , but he had some tie-up with Mulkerin . " " I do not know him , " Tomas said , looking away . " I saw him once , " Fernandez spoke reluctantly . " He was strange . . . he was an old one . " " Strange ? How ? " " Well , just strange . Kept to himself . Never came into town . The other Indians fought shy of him , never seemed easy around him , almost like they were scared . " " What 's to be scared of ? " Russell asked , contemptuously . " I seen him once . Just an old man . . . looked to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow him away . " Tomas lifted his black eyes to Russell . He did not likep66him very much . " But none has , " he said . " In a hundred years a man sees much smoke . Silva was slicing bacon into a pan . " They say he can call up the spirits . . . that he can will things to happen . " Russell laughed . " Nonsense ! That 's pure nonsense ! " They sat together , dozing and talking . Wooston , Russell , Alexander , Fernandez , and Andres Machado . Their party had grown in size , and among the additions were a dozen Californios , of whom Silva was one . Silva was a short , square-shouldered man , three-quarters Indian , one-quarter Spanish . He was a good cook , an excellentvaquero , and a tracker . Few of the Californios had any use for wild country , but Silva was an exception , as Pedro Fages and Father Garces had been . " What you figure on doin ' when we catch ' em ? " Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild country , " Wooston said , " it 's easy to get lost out here . Be surprisin ' if they ever found their way back . " Russell took a cigar from his vest pocket . " Be a real surprise to me , " he said . " Any number of accidents can happen . " Machado looked at them with distaste . " Your business is your business , " he said shortly . " I want that girl and a whip . That is all . " " And Sean Mulkerin ? Who stole your woman ? " " I do not know that he stole her . She fled . . . it was some silly girl 's whim . . . and it was his boat . However , " he added , " I shall fight him and kill him . " " Better just kill him , " Russell advised . " Him ? " Machado sneered . " I never liked him , anyway . No , I shall fight him and kill him . It would give me great satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senor . He is very strong , a good fighter . If I were you , I would shoot him . . . from far off . When he falls I would shoot into him five more times , just to be sure . "  |p67Machado  snorted , and reached into the pan for a strip of bacon . Tomas went on . " In my cantina one night . . . it was only last year . . . five men from another ship decided to rob him . Mulkerin was coming up from the shore with the money from the sale of a cargo . These were bad men . And they started a fight with him . " " I remember somethin ' about that , " Wooston said . " Killed a couple of them , did n't he ? " " I can not afford to have killings at me cantina , " Tomas replied gravely , " so bodies are never found there . However , two bodies were found on the road near the cienaga .. . and there were two other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He ran , Senor . He had less courage but greater wisdom . Capitan Mulkerin had a few scratches , I think , and skinned knuckles . " " Knives , " Machado said . " They should have used knives . " " Two of them tried , Senor Machado . Two of them tried very hard with knives . One died with his own knife in his ribs , the other had a broken arm and collarbone . " It was a somber day . Low gray clouds lay upon the mountains , shrouding the peaks and the higher ridges . The canyons were silent , awesome , haunted . When they started out again , Fernandez led off . But he had gone only a short distance when he drew up sharply . " What is it ? " Machado demanded impatiently . Fernandez pointed . Two crossed sticks lay in the trail . " Well ? What of it ? " Wooston demanded , as they bunched around . " I do not like it , " Fernandez said . " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We waste time ! " He rode over the sticks and on down the trail , and the others followed.  |p68From  high in the rocks above them there came a weird , lonely howl , a howl that sent chills up their spines . Once more they drew up , guns in hand . The howl rose , died away , then lifted again . Their eyes searched the rocks above them , but they saw nothing . " Coyote , " Russell said . " That ? " Tomas stared at him . " That was no coyote . It was a soul of the dead , a lost soul . " Wooston laughed . " Well , I ai n't afraid of no ghosts . Let 's go . " One of Machado 's men was in the lead . Suddenly , they saw his horse rear wildly , and the man drew his pistol and fired . Rushing up , they saw nothing . " What 's the matter ? " Wooston demanded . " You gone crazy ? " " There was a snake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ? Where is he now ? " There was no snake , no winding trail in the dust , nothing . Tomas glanced uneasily at Silva , who shrugged . " There was a snake ! " the man repeated stubbornly . " I saw it . So did my horse . " " So ? Ai n't you never seen a snake before ? Let 's go ! " Russell was impatient . With a glance of contempt , Machado rode past into the lead . The trail wound down a long , shallow draw , dusty and dry , with scattered rocks and cacti . Suddenly Machado stopped , waiting for Silva . " The trail is gone , " he said . " Find it . " Silva rode on past and began casting back and forth for the lost trail . " Be dark soon , " Russell muttered . The way grew increasingly rugged . Now the junipers were giving way to scattered pines , and along the streams the sycamores were larger , older , and in greater number.  | " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd better camp . " Silva had picked up the trail , then lost it again . He led them now down into a flat place near a stream where there were several large sycamores . He glanced around uneasily . " What place is this ? " Machado asked . Silva shrugged . " The stream , I think , is the Sespe . This place , I have heard of it before . It is a bad place . " " Looks good to me . " Wooston swung down . " There has been death here , " Silva said . " I was told of this place . " " Forget it , " Wooston said , " this here 's as good a camp as we 're likely to find . " He turned toward Silva . " They far ahead of us ? " Silva hesitated , thinking . Then he shrugged . " Maybe an hour , two hours . No more . " " What 's wrong ? " Wooston 's eyes searched Silva 's . " I do not like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . " Wrong ? How ? " " The Old One leads them . He guides them . " " So ? " " Something is wrong , Senor . He no longer tries to get away . " " What 's that mean ? " Wooston was frowning and KingPinRussell had stopped loosening his saddle to listen . " If he no longer tries to get away it is because he wishes us to catch up , and if he wishes us to catch up , there may be a trap , no ? " " Trap , Hell ! Any trap will be for them , not us . " Russell turned to Silva . " A trap ? Now where would they be likely to try that ? " Silva hesitated , looking from one to the other . " This place , " he said , " I think this is the place . This is the trap . "  |p70Shortly  before noon the Old One led them to a creek . " We will rest for a few minutes and water our horses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judging from the growth they were probably three thousand feet or so above sea level , and at a guess the ridgebefore them , running roughly east and west , was three tofour thousand feet higher . He crossed to his mother . She was kneeling by the stream , washing the dust from her face with a damp cloth . " I think we are close , " he said . " You are right . " He extended a hand and she took it and rose . " I wonder why he stopped ? " " To rest , he said . " She glanced around . " He is gone . So is Montero . " Sean turned quickly . The horses were there , but the two old men were gone . Mariana came to them . " Is this the place ? " " No , " Sean said , " but I am trying to decide where we are . " He nodded ahead . " That could be Pine Mountain . . . and if it is , this might be the Piedra Blanca. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shrugged . " There are no maps of this country . Men give names to places , but who knows which creek is the one named ? Who knows which mountain ? Sometimes a man would name creeks and mountains and then another would come who did not know about the first one and he would name them all over again . " They waited beside the creek , resting and talking in a desultory fashion . Sean was nervous and worried . From time to time he walked back toward the way they had come , but the trail was visible for only a hundred yards or so . He checked his guns again and again . Suddenly they reappeared , Montero coming down off the rocks into the little hollow . Immediately he went to his horse and tightened the cinch . " We go now , " he said . Juan appeared a moment later and they rode off up a steep , winding trail that led into a notch in the mountain wall that had once been a stream bed . The area was thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded and old , upon rocks . Twice deer ran away before them . The gorge narrowed until they rode single file , each horse scrambling up the slippery , waterwornrocks in turn . They topped out suddenly on a long plateau or mesa , scattered with trees , but mostly covered with yellowing grass . They saw deep tracks , and nothing else . Juan led out , riding straight across the mesa toward the northwest . He dipped down through the trees and drew up on a sandy shore beside a running creek . Opposite there was a high , rocky wall , around them a ring of such walls . " We will stop here , " he said , and got down . It was a quiet place , haunted yet beautiful . The cottonwoodleaves rustled gently and spread wide over the hardpackedearth and sand , offering shade and shelter . There wasp72a spring among some rocks that flowed down toward the creek . On the far side were the fallen walls of a stone cabin of some kind , only a few stones remaining in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and you and you , " he indicatedSean and Mariana , " will stay . " " And I ? " Eileen Mulkerin asked . " You will come . " " I do n't like the idea , " Sean protested , " we should stay together . " " She will be safe . " " How long will you be gone ? " " Until daybreak , perhaps a little longer . I will tell only her . . . for now . You ride , you shoot , you sail about on the big water . . . perhaps tomorrow you die . I will tell her . " His mother took her rifle and turned to them , smiling . " I 'll be all right . " Juan started off , Eileen Mulkerin following . " I 'll be all right , " Mariana said , " if you wish to follow them . " " Follow him ? He would know , somehow . He always knows . If he says stay , we stay . " " I will make coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to gather wood . Several times Sean paused to listen and to look around . There were no deer tracks here , no tracks at all . The realizationworried Sean , although he did not know why , Twice , in gathering wood , he saw arrowheads . They were longer , slimmer than any he had seen before , and beautifully worked . Stooping to pick up a stick he saw an egg-shell thin bit of pottery . It crumbled to dust in his fingers . " What kind of a place is this ? " he asked Montero . The Californio shrugged . " It is a place in which to be still , " he said briefly . Then after a moment , because after all he had known Sean since he was a child , he said , " It is a place of the Old Ones . "  |p73Sean  glanced at him , then strolled back to where Mariana had started the coffee . " Do n't wander around , " he said to her . " Stay close to the fire and the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not yet , but this place is eerie . Do n't you feel it ? " " It is quiet . " " I wonder where they went . " " After the gold , I suppose . Better stay back under the trees . If anyone should come up they 'd not be likely to see you . " What about you ? " " I thought I 'd look around the ruins , over there . " " I 'll come with you then . " Montero spoke . " Senor , I would not go over there . It is not a good place . Under the trees is best , or near the fire . " " All right . " Sean glanced again at the ruins , puzzled . Not a good place ? Superstition , probably . There was a lot of it among the Indians and some of the Californios . This place was far from any he remembered . There had always been talk , of course . Here and there some hunter of wild horses had penetrated this wild country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bit . But actually very little was known . Sean paced uneasily , aware that somewhere , not too far off , Machado and the others would be searching for them . Wild as the country was , and scarce as trails were , they might still be found , and he had no desire for a pitched battle in such a place as this with Mariana and his mother along . Jesus Montero was an old but careful man , and a good shot . He was not the kind to pull out when the going was rough . Nor was his mother , that stubborn woman . " Let 's cook up now , " he suggested , " then we 'll eat and put out the fire . No point helping them find us . " Montero agreed , but took over the cooking himself . Seanp74wandered about , studying the rim and places where he could be without offering a target . He avoided the ruins because he had no wish to anger Montero . He liked the old man and respected his wishes . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basin , and from the rim above , studied the country around . There were too many concealed approaches , too many places men could hide . When Sean returned to the fire , there were tortillas , bacon , and coffee . As they ate , he talked to Mariana . She was , he decided , not only beautiful but also uncommonly sensible . " You said he was an Indian ? The Old One ? " " Who knows ? We call him Juan , and my father called him that , but whether it is his name or not , we 'll never know . Nor will we know whether he is Mexican , Indian , or Anglo . I think he 's Indian , but as I 've said , of some tribe we do not know . He 's supposed to be from a vanished people . " " We have those in Mexico . Vanished people , I mean . " " Indian wars . . . they were always fighting , just like our ancestors were in Europe , only the tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe died out . " " Will she be all right with him ? " " The Senora ? She will . She can take care of herself . But the old man , he would die for her . " " You call her the Senora when she is your mother . Why ? " " Stay around awhile and you 'll see . She is the Senora , believe me , she is . Rarely raises her voice but everybody knows who 's boss . She was that way with everybody but Pa . Everybody called her the Senora . They still do . " He checked his gun again . " I wish Mike was here . " " Mike ? You mean your brother Michael ? " " Sure . He 's hell-on-wheels with a gun or a rope and can ride anything that wears hair . I know he 's gone peaceful , the Church and all that , but sometimes I wonder how peaceful . " Somewhere up in the rocks , an owl hooted.  | " You 'd better get some sleep . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning . " " I am not tired . " " After that ride ? You get some rest . " " My father ran cattle in the mountains of Guerrero . I have ridden much further . " " Can you use a gun ? " " You ask me that ? Of course . " Then , reflectively , " Andres would not have liked me , anyway . He did not know what he was asking for . When he saw me all dressed , he did not know that I could ride and shoot like any vaquero . He would not have found me so easy to handle . " " You must sleep . It will be after daylight , they said , before they are back . " In the darkness there was no sound but the leaves and the water . No birds , no frogs . Mariana walked deeper into the shadows and lay down on her blanket , using her saddle for a pillow . Sean followed and covered her with a poncho . " You 're nice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She closed her eyes and listened to the slight jingle of his spurs as he walked back to the fire . He thrust sticks into the coals , just enough to keep it alive and then walked away . She listened to the sound of his crunching steps on the sand . It was a friendly , pleasant sound . She snuggled down under the poncho and slept . He stood in the shadows some fifty feet away and listened . Mentally he sorted out the sounds of the night . Each place had its own sounds , only here there were fewer . What was there about this place ? There were people who believed that the sorrow or happinessor fear of people who had lived in a place left their mark upon it . He had known houses that were always damp and cold , houses that never seemed to be warm , and therep76were others that one felt to be home the moment one went through the door . There had been frightful happenings in some places , and people said a mark was left upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He had grown up to stories of the strange and mysterious , both from his mother and from the Indians . The Celts had a strain of darkness and mystery in their blood . . . was it that ? Unexplainable things happened . He had known a few of them at sea , and then there was that time when he had gone ashore in Pegu . . . over Burma way . He had talked to an old man in a ruined templeSomething was stirring out there in the darkness . Like a shadow , holding close to the rocks , he moved back . Montero was there . " I heard it , too , " he said , " but we must wait . It might be one of the others . " Only a few miles away , Juan had stopped . He had led the way to a high meadow rimmed with low , boulderstrewnhills . They were nearly at the top of the range , she decided . " The horses will be safe here . " " We are to walk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Senora ? There is not much gold , I think . Maybe there is not enough . I do not know what gold means to you , or how much it would take . " " Can we be back after daybreak ? " " You are afraid for them ? " " Sean is strong . He is a very good fighter , I have heard , but there are many of them . " " He will not be alone . " " You mean Mariana ? And Jesus ? " " There are others . " " Others ? " " You are very young , Senora . I am very old , very , veryp77old . Who knows what others there are , out here in the silences ? We who are very old are closer to Them than you. " f do not understand . " " Some say this place is haunted , and the place where I left them , but the ways of evil are always haunted , and evil breeds its own destruction . I think that is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , he spoke again . " The mind is fed by the imagination and the imagination feeds upon the intangible . Men have seen things and heard things and such things remain in their minds . These things breed fear , worry , a desire to be away , far away . " " You do not talk like an Indian , Juan . " " What is an Indian ? How does an Indian talk ? An Indian is someone to whom the word seems to apply . It says no more than that , Senora . An Indian can be anything or anybody . You whites have just come , but what you call Indians came not long before you . Before them there were other peoples , and who knows who was the first ? " The land belongs to those who live upon it , Senora , and people come and go . We will not be the last , you and I , and these about us . " " You spoke of evil as though it had a power in itself ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , and the city became evil , and perhaps it was the evil it created that destroyed it . And perhaps it was just a changing of the earth . I are all that is left . " " Someday , " she said quietly , " you must tell me all you remember . We know of the Aztecs and the Incas , but not of this place you mention . " .. The Aztecs and Incas were not old people . They were newcomers . The Aztecs marched down from the north and settled in the reed beds around the lake . After awhile they grew strong and defeated many other peoples . The Incas were upstarts also , building on what had been done before . " He chuckled . " But then , we all do that . But I am only anp78old Indian and have nothing to say that needs to be remembered . You must rest , Senora . Tomorrow we will go the last few steps . " " Ca n't we go now ? " " Does gold smell ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for that there must be light . Sleep , now . "  |p79A  hand touched Mariana 's shoulder and she awakened instantly . Sean was squatting beside her . " Better wake up . I think they are coming now . " " The Senora ? " " The others . " " He glanced at the glowing coals . " Stay out of sight . I do not want them to know who is here or how many . She got up quickly and took up her saddle and blanket , carrying them into the shadows . Sean took the saddle from her , and the blanket . Quickly , he saddled her horse . " Do n't get too far from your horse , and if the worst comes , ride out of here , and fast . Go to Los Angeles and see Pio Pico . Tell him the story . " He walked back to the edge of the darkness . The moon was up and the small clearing was bathed in light . From down the canyon there was a click of a hoof on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward riding in a tight bunch . There were nine or ten of them . Too many . Sean 's position was excellent . He had fairly good cover , and his body merged with the trees and rocks behind him.  |p80On  his left and some twenty yards off was Mariana , and with her , the horses . Montero had disappeared , but he was not worried about Montero . He would be where it was best for him to be . They came on , walking their horses . The shadows from the moon , the trees and weird rock formations made a mysteryof the darkness . " I can smell smoke , " Russell said . " There 's a fire , " someone else said . " It is almost out . " " You are near enough , " Sean spoke in a conversational tone , making no effort at a threat . " Just stand where you are . " " Who is it ? " " Sean Mulkerin speaking , and you have come a long way to ride back with nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was flat and harsh . " Where is Mariana de la Cruz ? " Machado asked . " She has made a decision . She does not wish to marry you ! Machado laughed with contempt . " Women do not make decisions . Her uncle consented , and it is enough . We have laws , gringo . " " Good laws they are , " Sean replied quietly . " I obey them . Do you ? And do not think to offend me by calling me gringo . I do not mind the name . And I am as good a Mexicanas you are , Machado , whose mother was a Greek . " " You talk a great deal , gringo . " " I know a great deal . . . about all of you . " " Where is she , gringo ? " Machado shook out a coiled whip . " I 've brought this for her . " They started to spread out a little . Sean laughed . " They do not want to be close to you , Machado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not afraid . " " Of course not , Machado . Neither are you a fool . Dop81you wish to be killed for a girl who ran away from you ? It would be foolish , amigo . My advice is to withdraw . " " Senora ? " Wooston called . " Nobody talks but me , " Sean said . " It was agreed . " " Senora ? Give us the gold and you may all go free . I promise it . " " Do you think she would take the word of a thief ? " Sean asked contemptuously . " You call me a thief ? " " You are here . If you are not a thief , why are you here ? " " I think he is alone , " Russell said suddenly . " Let 's take him . " In the deep shadows , Mariana clicked one stone against another . It sounded somewhat like a rifle bolt . From high in the rocks there came two more such sounds . One was definitely a rifle being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not alone , but if you wish to die for nothing , come . I can kill two , at this range , before you even move . " Machado liked none of this . They were out in the open clearing with the moonlight on them . The sounds had come from widely spaced positions . " Come ! " Machado turned his horse . " It will soon be daylightand they can not escape . " Slowly , they rode back into the canyon . A hundred and fifty yards away , they drew up . " We can wait here , " Machado said . " Hell , " Russell scoffed . " We could have taken ' em ! Who can there be ? Two women , an old man , and Mulkerin . " Machado looked up at him . " Do not be a fool , Russell . I happen to know that Sean Mulkerin is a fighter . And a dead shot . It is said that the widow is also a good shot . And there is the other man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can shoot , " Silva said shortly . " He is a brave man . He moves like a ghost . " Somebody laughed.  |p82Wooston  turned sharply . " Who laughed ? " Wooston glared around , from one to the other , but nobodyspoke . It was Silva , finally , who said , " The Old One may be a ghost . Who knows ? " " If we find him , we shall see , " Russell said grimly . " I 'll find out if a ghost can bleed . " A small rock fell , bouncing from rock to rock in the silence . " Build a fire , Silva , " Wooston said . " Might as well have coffee while we wait . " " You are not afraid they will run again ? " Fernandez asked . Wooston scoffed . " Let them run . We 'll find them . " After a moment he added , " I 've a hunch this is it . I think the gold is somewhere near . " " Where are we , anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them we will go back . The trail we followed is always there . " From high in the rocks , there was laughter . It sounded like nothing they had ever heard , but it was laughter . Was the tone as wild and eerie as it sounded ? Or was it the echo from the rocks ? The wildness of the area and their own imaginations ? Russell hunched his shoulders a little and glanced at the others . Wooston was chewing on some dried beef and Machado was lighting a thin cigar . Tomas looked at Russell and smiled inwardly . The big , tough American was a little frightened , he thought . Look at Machado , a man of iron . The fire blazed up and they all felt better . " We 'll get them tomorrow , " Wooston said , " and they 'll have some gold . " Back at the clearing Sean went down from the rocks to where Mariana waited . " You were right on time , " he said . " It helped . " " So were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they ? "  |p83There  was no sound . Then Jesus Montero came in to join them . " Put on the pot , " he said , " we will have coffee . " " But the Senora ! " Mariana said . " I heard them . They should be here ! " " You heard something , Senorita , " Montero said . " Who knows what you heard ? " " When I was a little boy , " Sean said , " the vaqueros told strange stories about Juan . The Indians went to him wheneveranyone was very sick . Sometimes the Californios also . " " He cured them ? " " He did . " Sean stirred the fire and added a few sticks . " Once there were two very bad men who decided to follow him to find the gold they heard about . They were going to force the secret from him . " " What happened ? " " Nobody ever knew . The two men were found dead , no marks on their bodies . Their guns had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chewed on cold tortillas and dried beef . " It grows light , " Montero said . " We should move now . " " What about the Senora and Juan ? " Sean asked . " They will find us . " Each filled a cup , then Montero poured the coffee on the coals and dipped the pot in the creek to cool it off . He had turned and started back when he suddenly dropped to the ground in a long running dive . A bullet clipped a rock above his head . Sean , catching up his Colt rifle , ran to the rocks . He caught a shadow of movement , lifted his rifle , and shot . Somebody swore , but it was not the curse of a man wounded . Under his covering fire Montero made it into the trees . Sean watched him go , and wondered . Wooston and Machado and the others could edge in , could make thep84place impossible to defend . He reloaded his rifle , waited a bit , then edged away to a new position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready , amigo . We will go nearer to where the Senora is . " " All right . " " He fired at a rock where he thought a man was hiding , ran a few steps back , and fired again . Sliding down from the rocks , he mounted and they rode their horses up a narrow draw behind the trees . For several hundred yards it was so narrow a man might have almost touched both walls , and it was a scramble for the horses over slick rocks and around boulders . Then they went up a bank and into a small forest of juniper and manzanita . A few minutes later they were in the pines that covered most of the mountain . Montero led them at a rapid pace along a winding forest trail that took them ever higher upon the pine-clad slopes , often broken by arroyos or canyons . Topping out on a high ridge , Montero pointed . " The Sespe is there . If anything happens to me , just ride south . " Eileen Mulkerin drew up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stream that ran roughly east and west . The creek then turned to flow almost due north . On her left and somewhat higher up there seemed to be a break in the mountain . Juan had paused only for a moment , and now he turned toward the south , seeming to head toward the break . Severaltimes he doubled back on his trail to wipe it out . He would ride back , get down and ever so gently brush out thep85tracks with an evergreen bough . Then he would sift dust and pine needles over the brushed-out tracks . Suddenly he came to a place under a huge old oak that was marked by fallen stones which seemed to have once been a wall . " The horses must stay here . We will walk . " She took her rifle and a water sack , and he led the way , moving with surprising speed among the rocks . He wentup the mountain away from the creek . The yucca , which had been plentiful at lower levels , was scarce now . Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least a half mile apart , Juan paused in the shade . " I am afraid there is very little gold . " His eyes searched her face . " Perhaps it will not be enough ? " The thought was frightening . She had hoped so much for this . The idea that there might be no gold , now when they so desperately needed it , was shattering . " Where does it come from ? The gold , I mean ? " Juan paused , then stopped walking , and then answered . " Long ago my people came to this place . It was as far away for us as for you , but we came . And there was some gold here . We had little need for it , and used it for decoration . When our city was destroyed in the earthquakes , we no longer went for the gold . " How had the Mulkerins come to think of it as a treasure ? She could not recall that Jaime had ever said anything about quantity , yet somehow it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with all stories of treasure . All she could do now was hope that there was enough gold remaining to pay what they owed on the ranch . When they stopped again she looked around . They were in a giant horseshoe almost a mile from the opening to the towering back wall . On three sides the walls went at least a thousand feet above the creek . A skilled mountain climber might climb out , she supposed , but otherwise there would be nothing to do but return the way they had come . At the head of the creek the rock wall was a massive rampartshutting out most of the light and leaving the great hollow in deep shadow . " It is here , " Juan said . " I will show you . " Near the head of the creek were the scattered rocks of an old structure of some sort . There was a gap in the rocks andp86a hard-packed path of sand led between them . Juan led the way . There was a cave there . . . did she see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the cave , a shelf . Upon the shelf was a row of jars . Juan took down one of them , and her heart missed a beat . She took the jar . There was gold , all right . Gold dust and - a few small nuggets , half the size of her little fingernail . She took the leather pouch she had brought and poured the gold into it . When she had emptied every grain she hefted it in her hand . Five pounds ? It might be . . . but less than half of what was needed . One after another she checked the other jars . Out of one she took perhaps an ounce . The others were empty . Juan watched her face anxiously . " It is not enough ? " " It will help , " she said , " but it is not enough . But thank you , old friend , you have done all you could . Thank you , thank you ! " All of the years since she first came to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now she was here . Slowly , Eileen Mulkerin looked around . " We should rest , " Juan suggested . " It is a long way back . " " They will be waiting , " Eileen Mulkerin said , " and they may be in trouble . " " Jesus Montero will know what to do , " Juan said . " We must rest , Senora . We must rest here . "  |p87Within  the cave it was cool and silent . The old man sat down against the wall and leaned his head back , sighing deeply . Despite her fear , Eileen Mulkerin was shocked to see the terrible weariness in the old man 's face . She had been so filled with her own troubles that she had not considered the great strain this journey must have been for him . She was tired , and she was one who rode or walked every day , who had been in the saddle since she was a child , and since coming to California had ridden over the roughest , wildest country imaginable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been thoughtless . " " I shall rest , " he replied , " but you rest , also . And . . . " he opened his eyes and looked at her , " do not go from this place . There is great danger here . . . the greatest . " He leaned his head back again and closed his eyes , but there was to be no sleep for her , not yet . What could he mean by great danger here ? She stood in the mouth of the cave looking about her . The horseshoe curve of mountains was bare rock in places ,  |p88covered  with pines in others , but all around her the cliffs rose high . The stillness was oppressive . She listened for sound . Somewhere , not too many miles away , Sean might now be fighting for his life . He was shrewd , tough , a good fighter . Montero was , too , old though he might be . The girl Mariana , there was good stuff there . She had taken the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things easier . That she came from a good home as well as a wealthy one was obvious . She had the knowledge and the deportmentthat went with such things . Was Sean in love with her ? It would not be surprising , she thought , for Mariana was certainly beautiful , and a man 's woman . No question of that . The silence seemed to press in on her . Why had Juan said the place was dangerous ? She saw nothing of danger . High up on the rim , she saw something move . No doubt the wind , she supposed . More than anything she needed time to think . The shock of that almost empty jar had been just about more than she could bear . They had been so sure the gold was there and that it would be enough , so much so that when doubts were raised they had never accepted them as possible . In their minds this had been a source where there would always be a little , just enough , to tide them over . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave to his sons , the land Mexico had given for his service as an officer in their army . All that she had wanted for her boys , now gone . She felt sick and empty . It could not be , it simply could not be . Yet the facts were remorseless , relentless . She refused to accept defeat . There had to be a way . She was alive , she was strong , she had intelligence . She had simply trusted too much to this place , in this gold gathered by unknown hands so long , long ago.  |p89They  had come far for it , Juan had said . As far as she herself had come . Yet where had the gold itself come from ? Had it been mined close by ? The cave did not appear mineralized , the rocks seemed barren . There were tool marks on the stone at the entrance , which seemed to have been enlarged , and even the cave itself had been shaped to some degree . Why ? The gold itself did not look like placer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had been gathered here . The source of the gold itself must be near , for the small nuggets were jagged , rough , showing none of the signs of abrasion from being rolled among the rocks and gravel of a rushing stream . The source ? It might be some corner , some hollow nearby , and it might be anywhere up in those towering cliffs around her . If they only had the timeBut they had no time . Even the stone and gravel ledge upon which she stood , which opened out at the cave 's mouth to make a flat , even surface to the creek 's bank , seemed to have been leveled and smoothed for some purpose . Evidently they had come here , as Juan said , from some distance , and had remained in this place until they had sufficient gold for their purpose . Yet where had it come from ? She had seen no evidence of mining , nor of any work whatsoever , merely this cave , not very impressive of itself , and this terrace on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see nothing of the country around except the high walls of the horseshoecliffs , trees , brush , and boulders intervening . It was an eerie , haunted place . Uneasily she walked across the terrace and looked down the stream bed . She could see only a little way , but the water dropped swiftly . It was not a cheerful stream , but one that ran swift and dark under the shadows of cliff and tree . She poked atp90the sand under the clear water . Could there be gold there ? Suddenly , from far off , there was a call . It was a lonely call , seemingly undirected , as lonely as a wolf calling to the moon . She shivered . Should she awaken Juan ? The old man had seemed frighteningly tired , and after all , it had been only a few minutes ago that he fell asleep . She was being a fool . What was there to be afraid of ? Not one chance in a thousand that anyone could find her here in this cul-de-sac . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place to go but back . " Jaime , " she spoke softly . " I need you , Jaime . " The leaves rustled , and there was stillness . She lifted her eyes toward the cliffs . They seemed to shimmer in the heat , but she felt suddenly cold as though a chill wind had blown down the canyon . But there was no wind . Again she heard that strange , lonely cry . She could not place the direction . It seemed to come from far off , from no place in particular . She remembered the stories about Juan , the way the other Indians avoided talking about him . Even Jesus Montero , who knew her so well , would not talk about him . They spoke of him as having strange powers , of disappearing into broad daylight . Indians were superstitious and believed in all mannerof things . Suppose they were right ? She remembered one night by the fireside back at the ranch when Jaime had suddenly begun talking to her of an old medicine man he had known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadside , looking as though he had fallen , yet there was no place to fall from . They had taken him with them , fed him , cared for him , treated his wounds . He recovered miraculously but to Jaime , when they were alone , he told a strange story . He had , he said , been traveling on the " other side . " When asked about the other side he had been evasive and would say only that it looked like this but was different ,  |p91that  he had often been to the other side but this time there was " trouble " and he could not find his way back , and when he saw a " sipapu " it was not where he had expected . It was one unknown to him , and he had fallen . " I think , " Jaime had said , " that wherever the other side is , Juan has been there , too . " " But what does it mean ? " He had shrugged . " How can I say ? The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Monte Alban in Mexico I saw observatories for studying the stars far better than anything we have . How do we know what they knew ? " She remembered a padre at San Gabriel Mission had told her of the belief the Hopis had , of coming to this earth from a " hole in the ground " and that place had been called a " sipapu , " or something of that sort . She had asked Jaime what the old medicine man had meant when he found his sipapu where it was not expected to be . " All I could get from him was that there were certain places , some of them constant , some shifting in position , where one might pass through the curtain to the other side . In seeking the one he knew , he found one of which he had known nothing . " It would grow dark quickly in this place , for the cliffs would allow only sunlight from overhead . She looked around , then walked back to the cave . Glancing through the door she saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little longer . Seated by the door , she thought of possible solutions , one by one . Even those she discarded , she examined once again . Alvarado was their friend and had been her husband 's friend , but he was far away to the north . Pio , although he was a kindly man , had troubles of his own . Their debts were not large , scarcely twenty-five hundred dollars in all , but that was a large sum in California in these times . Not long ago a ranch as large as their own had soldp92for even less , and they had no friend who could come up with so much . Only there was a difference . They now had almost half the sum . Could they somehow come up with the rest ? They might sell the Lady Luck , but it would bring very little now , and the governor was growing harsher about inspecting cargoes . They still had several hundred hides , but unless an unexpectedtrading vessel showed up , there was no market for them . They had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horses but so did everybody else and there was simply no market for them . Again and again she went over the ground , taking each item in turn . It was very hot , and the late afternoon sun struck directly upon her . Heat waves shimmered , even more than on the desert . She got up , feeling a little nausea , and for a moment thought she saw an Indian standing at the edge of the terrace . She started to speak , moved forward , and then the illusion faded and there was only the heat waves above a bare place on the rocky ledge beyond the terrace . It was time to go . Juan might be tired , but she must awaken him . Turning , she went to the cave . Her head ached , and she was worried and frightened , yet her sense of fear seemed to have no focal point , only an all-pervading feeling of strangeness and uncertainty . The old man lay upon the floor . Apparently he had not moved . " Juan ? We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did not move , nor did he speak . Suddenly shocked , she stepped into the cave and bent over him . " Juan ? Juan ! " There was no answer . She touched him , shook him slightly . He did not move . His eyes were open , staring upwardat the cave roof . He was dead.  |p93She  touched his eyes gently , closing them . His skin was cool to the touch . He must have died shortly after lying down . She took up the jacket she had worn when they first came up the creek and placed it over him . " Sleep , Juan , " she said gently . " You have earned it . " She took her rifle and canteen and left the cave , turning toward the faint path along the creek . She walked swiftly to where their horses were resting . Nothing was to be gained here . She had what gold there was , and she felt sure Juan 's body would be safe in the cave . She had seen no animal tracks about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , they could come back and bury the old man , but for now there was nothing she could do . Untying the horses , she mounted quickly , and , leading Juan 's horse , started down the trail , riding swiftly . Now she had but one driving thought . Get back to the others , stand with them , and when they could , slip away and return to the Malibu . The answer , she felt sure , was there and not here . She had ridden for almost an hour before she heard a sound other than those of her own movements . When she heard it , the sound came from far off . It was a rifle shot . Pointing her rifle at the sky , she fired . Maybe they would hear that and know she was coming , or maybe the others would hear it and wonder who it might be . Murder is not lightly done and even Machado , with his reckless disregard for law , would hesitate . So would Wooston , essentially a cautious man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean , or that the party had been divided . She rode at a rapid trot , the best pace for the ground she covered , and she kept her rifle ready . Suddenly , long before she expected to come up with them , she heard another shot . Rounding a bend in the trail , she pulled up short . Theyp94were just before her , almost opposite the head of the Piedra Blanca , with Mariana leading the packhorses and Montero and Sean coming along slower . Montero saw her and rode up swiftly . " We have a little time , Senora , but we must go back . " " Do you remember the old trail ? Back of Reyes Peak ? " " Si , Senora . It has been years , but  --  " " Lead us then . Somewhere we should be able to cut over to the Cherry Creek trail to Old Man Canyon . We will go home now . Lose them if you can . " Sean rode swiftly up , glancing suddenly at the empty saddle of the lead horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died back there after he showed me the gold . " " I am sorry . He was a fine old man , a fine man . I could have learned much from him . " " He told me he had taught you what was most important . He said it would not seem like much , but it was , and you would see . " " Let 's go . We 've killed nobody yet and I 'd prefer not to . " " Sean ? There is n't enough . There is scarcely half enough . " He shot her a quick glance , then nodded . " I was afraid . I suspected . " " We must think of something , Sean . We must think quickly , you and me . " " Did you see where the gold came from ? Any old workings ? " " No . It was a strange , empty place . The gold was in a pot on a shelf , most of the other pots were empty . The Old One wanted to rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died almost at once but I did not know it for several hours . " They rode on , turning sharply south for about a mile , then west again with Reyes Peak bulking large on their left and ahead.  | " Sean , there 's something strange about that place . I was almost sick up there , dizzy . Once I thought I saw an Indian of some kind , but he just faded out . " " ' Of some kind ' ? What kind ? " " He was . . . different , I guess . I just caught a glimpse , but it was my imagination , anyway . " " Sean glanced back . Could he see dust in the air ? Or was that , too , imagination ? Nothing his mother had said surprised him . . . why ? He turned the thought in his mind , puzzled by it . He prided himself on being a straightforward , hardheadedman of the sea . . . of the sea ? Did that make a difference ? For the men who sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mysterious , they travel to faraway lands where customs , religions , and thoughts are all keyed to a different tempo , and somewhere along the line become less resistant to the amazing , the unusual , and the seemingly unreasonable . Or was it simply the Irish in him ? That Celtic background of Druids and leprechauns ? Of chieftains , saints , and pagan gods ? The top of Reyes Peak was lit by the fire of sunset , and a soft wind from the sea moved through the pines . Suddenly they emerged from the trees riding along the ridge of Pine Mountain toward the west . Eileen Mulkerin stood in her stirrups , her hair blowing in the wind , and looked back the way they had come . " I hope they can ride ! " she commented grimly . " Before they see their homes again they 'll have been around ! " Montero slowed his pace . Along the skyline they went , Montero leading , followed by Mariana and the pack animals , then Eileen Mulkerin and Sean . She glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " not a word of complaint from her and she does what she can and stays out of the way . " He smiled . " She 's not mine , Senora , although  --  "  | " I know , " Eileen Mulkerin looked again at the slender girl ahead of them , " but she 's made of good yardage , that one . She will stay with you , all the way . " " Yes , I think so . " The trail suddenly veered to the right over a rocky surface , but Jesus did not turn . He pushed right on , going betweenclose-growing pines , turning abruptly down a steep slide , and picking his way along the side of a boulder-strewn canyon into a thick stand of timber . The trees were old , yet few were over thirty or forty feet tall , and there was evidence that a fire had swept through . Their way was steeply down through chaparral and yucca , the slopes dry and harsh . When the pace slowed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you thought of what we will do ? " he asked . " I have thought . We will give a fandango ! " He stared at her . " You are joking ? " " No , a fandango . It is the answer . We will invite them all ! Our friends , our enemies . . . everyone ! " She laughed at his amazement . " We do not have the money , right ? But we have some money , and do they know how much ? They do not ! They will see some gold , and their imaginations will make it three times as much ! We will laugh at them . We will taunt them with our splendor . " They will never believe this gold is all ! So we shall show a little of it , let their imaginations believe there is much more , and privately we will tell a few that there can be more . . . and indeed there can . . . but it takes money . First , this trifling debt . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " Only you would have the nerve , the audacity . . . 1 " " It will work , " she said quietly . " We shall win not by what there is , but by what they believe there is. "  |p97Montero  lagged behind , brushing lightly over their trail , then sifting dust over it to erase any marks that might be left . He held the dust high and let the breeze carry it where it would . Sean took the lead , with the Senora behind him . Occasionally , they rode side by side . He was a strong man , this son of hers , she decided . A man fit to move large upon the land . He was quiet , but very sure , and his trail sense was excellent . They found their way over the Cherry Creek trail to the Upper North Fork of Matilija Creek . About a half mile furtheralong , Sean turned into a cove among the rocks and rode back into a corner of the cliffs . There , obscured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level place . Blackened stones showed where others had camped , long ago . Stepping down from the saddle , he offered his hand to his mother , then to Mariana . " You knew this place ? " Mariana suggested . " No , but I could see the setback in the cliff face , andp98knew there were such places . " He stripped the saddle from her horse . Sean let the horses roll , then picketed them on a patch of grass nearby . There was a little water in the creek and their picket ropes allowed them to drink . Montero rode in a few minutes later and began putting a fire together . " It is safe , " he said . " They will not find us tonight . " Eileen Mulkerin did not sit down . She stood , feet apart , looking into the small flame . She liked the smell of the crushed juniper , the smell of wood-smoke , and the soft rustling of the water in the creek . Many times in the past she had camped in just such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , of his lean , strong body , the ease with which he moved , the grace of him . She rarely thought of him as dead . She liked to believe he was only away , that he would come back to her one day , and in the meanwhile she must do the best she could to preserve what belonged to them . If they could get back with the little gold they had , if they could ride into the pueblo of Los Angeles and buy things with some of this gold , people would start to talk , and she would be able to hold off Zeke Wooston and Fernandez . Gold was rarely seen and the sight of it would revive the old stories . If she said she would pay soon , the Californioswould believe her , and Wooston would hesitate to push too hard . The fandango would be a bold stroke , a show of confidence that would add to the belief that she had enough or would soon have enough to pay . A bat dipped and swirled in the air above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his endless songs into the night stillness.  |p99She  gathered wood , and Montero broiled beef over the fire . They sat together , talking very little , enjoying the night , the rest , and the food as well as the smell of wood-smoke and coffee . Sean took up his Colt rifle and moved away from the fire , but after a few minutes he was back . " Seems quiet enough , " he said . Jesus Montero glanced up at him , then at the Senora . " The Old One is dead , " he said softly . " It is not easy to believe . " We must go back and bury him when there is time , " Sean suggested . " What about his body ? " Eileen asked . " Will it be safe from wolves ? " Montero did not look up from his food but he said distinctly , " No animal will go where he lies . " Sean looked at him . " You mean wherever he lies . . . or where he lies now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " she said reluctantly , " I did not . " " His body will be safe , " Montero replied . " It is not a thing for worry . " " There will be Machado to deal with , " Sean commented . " He will make trouble . " " Leave him to me , " Eileen replied quietly . " It is all differentnow . We have a show of gold , and our position is stronger . You will see . It will make a difference , and Mariana shall help me plan the fandango . " She smiled . " We shall even invite Andres Machado . We shall invite them all ! " " They are gone , " Silva said . " Disappeared . " " That 's foolishness ! " Wooston said impatiently . " They came this way , they moved about , they left . There must be tracks . " " I think , " Fernandez interrupted , " the gold is nearby . Ip100think they stopped here , some went away for the gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold then , " Wooston said . " To hell with them . " " I do not care for gold , " Machado said . " I want them . I will kill them . All of them . " " You go ahead an ' kill ' em , " Russell said , " we 'll hunt for the gold . " Silva was silent . He glanced at the other vaqueros and the one called Francisco shrugged expressively . " You will not find the gold , " Silva said . " Only the Old One knows . " Wooston glanced at him irritably . Then he said , " We hired you for a tracker . Find ' ern . " Wooston walked over to the remains of the fire . It was cold and dead . How could they have slipped away like that ? He stared around the rocky cliffs , then slowly walked along the edge of the brush . He could see where the horses had been held , where the various people had slept , yet there seemed to be no tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bitter man , a greedy man and a cruel one . From boyhood , when he had been a hulking bully in a class of younger children , all of whom had been quicker and brighter than he , he had relied on strength rather than intelligence . But over the years he had developed a kind of cunning , and a grasp of character that was shrewd and penetrating . He knew very well whom he could frighten , knew those with whom he must be genial , and those to avoid . Ordinarilyhe would have avoided Sean Mulkerin . As for the widow Mulkerin , she was nothing but a woman for all their talk and he was not worried about her . She 'd scare . . . they all did . He wanted money and he wanted power . King-Pin Russell , a vindictive , dangerous man , was a tool to that end . Russell was a man who if offered two ways would alwaysp101choose the dishonest one . It was his nature . He was tough and egotistical , sure of his own shrewdness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suckers , he said , they were incompetent fools . Why most of them lived better , easier , and with freedom from his pressures had never occurred to him . He was sure most of them were secretly stealing or would have if they had the nerve . Basically Russell was a follower . First it was one man , then another . Now it was Wooston , whom he disliked but who always seemed to have money . He lived easier in Wooston 's shadow , and did what he was told until he could make a big strike himself and come away with enough money to tell them all to go to hell . From the moment he had first heard of the gold he had determined to have it for himself . Nobody in California had found any gold but there were rumors of it , and the Spanish had found gold in Mexico . Why should n't there be some here ? It was obvious the gold 's source was nearby . Why else had they stopped here ? He watched Wooston prowling about , studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke thought it was here , too , or close by . Machado did not care . All he wanted was a knife in Sean 's ribs and a whip for that girl . Fernandez wanted gold , but he wanted it quick and easy , the kind you could dig with a knife . . . from somebody'sribs . Tomas ? Tomas would bear watching . He was quieter , said less , watched more , and was steadier than any of the rest . Russell took the stub of a cigar from his pocket and lit it . His eyes strayed to Francisco . Aside from Silva he was the best tracker in the lot , and a wary , careful man as well . Francisco glanced his way and King-Pin offered him a cigar  |p102Francisco  was no fool . The American or Englishman or whatever he was wanted something . Well , so did he . He took the cigar . " Gracias , " he said , with a flash of white , even teeth . " Senor is generous . " " No , I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been noticingyou 're an almighty fine tracker ... maybe better than Silva . " Francisco shrugged . " Seems to me that gold is somewhere around . Now if you was to see anything , some little thing nobody else saw , you could tell me . " Wooston is impatient . So is Machado . They will want to move on , but you an ' me . . . we might sort of fall back . Then we could look around a mite . . . say we got lost ? " Francisco lit the cigar . His black eyes were steady . He knew when he was about to be used , but Russell was a dangerous man , and in difficulty could be useful . " Silva , " he suggested , " does not tell all . Silva is afraid of the Old One . . . many are . The Old One left the others here and went into the hills with the Senora . We have seen their tracks . " " You could follow them ? " Francisco shrugged . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One . " He looked at his cigar , then said , " Nor is it safe , Senor . " Russell dismissed that with a gesture . " You an ' me , we 'll fall back , get lost . All right ? " " All right . " Francisco drew deep on his cigar . He did not like this King-Pin , but if there was gold . . . enough of it ... well , a knife in the ribs before King-Pin could shoot him , which he was sure Russell would try to do when the gold was found . Zeke Wooston walked back to the fire which Russell had rekindled . " Ai n't no time for that , " he said impatiently . " We got to ride out . " " There is no trail , " Silva said . " There is only rock , andp103around this camp there are many tracks , tracks coming , going . . . but none of them go anywhere . " " I think he does not want to follow the trail , " Andres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva did not reply . He had learned the folly of talking back to men like Machado . It was not a thing to do if one wished to live long , and he , Silva , had lived long and expected to live longer . " The Old One , " he said after a moment , trying to choose his words , " follows trails we can not . All trails are not of this world , Senor . " Wooston grunted . " I reckon we can foller any trail he can foller . He an ' that Senora woman . " Silva glanced at him quickly . " Ah ? " " Yes , I seen ' em . I ai n't no tracker like some of these here Injuns , but I can read signs . The two of them taken off .. . now where do you suppose ? " " Follow them , Senor , " Silva suggested , delicately . " Your eyes are younger than mine , sharper , perhaps . Follow them . I can not . " " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean they went separately ? " " They are not here , Senor . They are gone . " " He waited for a minute and then said quietly , " I think they have gone back . I think they found what they wanted and they have gone back . " Andres Machado frowned . Why waste time in these godforsakenmountains if they were not here ? If they had gone back " You are sure of that ? " Silva shrugged . " Who can be sure ? It is what I believe . " " That settles it for me . " Machado was definite . He was bored with mountains , bored with camping , irritated by the poor food , and the heat , dust , and confusion . He was also bored by Wooston . The man was coarse and vulgar.  | " We ai n't found where they get that gold , " Wooston protested . " It has got to be close by . " Machado shrugged a shoulder . " Perhaps . I am not interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welloff , Senor Wooston . I came only to find Mulkerin and Mariana de la Cruz . I shall go back , and I shall take my men with me . " " Now see here ! " Wooston protested . " We started this together , an '  --  " " And now it is ended . If Mulkerin has returned to Malibu , I shall return also . I see no sense in running around over these awful hills looking for gold that may not even be here . " Gold in California ? Bah ! There is none . My family has been associated with this province from the beginning , and we know nothing of any gold . You pursue a will-o ' - the- wisp , my friend . " Wooston was angry , but he had no wish to have trouble with Machado , whom he might need very badly . But he did not wish to pursue a chase into this wild country with only his own group . There were too few of them . Wooston accepted a cup of coffee , mulling over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country himself . It gave him the willies . . . you could never tell who or what was back in that brush or behind the rocks . And what about that snake that was n't there ? What about those strange howls from up in the rocks ? " All right , " he said , " we 'll go back . " Francisco glanced at King-Pin Russell , who grinned and winked.  |p105Eileen  Mulkerin rode into the yard at the ranch on Malibu with her son beside her . Behind them were Mariana and Jesus Montero . She drew up in the yard and looked at the rough-looking crowd who faced her . Renegades , all of them , some gringos , some Mexicans . Brother Michael sat on the porch in the shade . He had a rifle across his knees . She looked at the renegades with eyes that were cold and level . " You have no business here You will leave . " Their leader , a swaggering man in a wide sombrero and wide-bottomed pants , wearing two guns , laughed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not go when a woman speaks . Senor Wooston told me to stay until he comes . I stay . " " My mother told you to leave , " Sean said quietly . " You have one minute . " Greek John was lean , whip-hard , and strong . He touched his mustache lightly and smiled . " Come , little one , " he said , " I shall teach you . "  |p106Sean  dismounted from his horse and trailed the reins . " Senora ? " he spoke gently . " Forgive me . " He swung , his fist exploding on the Greek 's chin . The Greek dropped to hands and knees , his sombrero flying loose . For a moment he stayed there , shaking his head . When he got up he held a knife in his hand . " Now I shall kill you , " he said . Sean made no move toward the Bowie , nor the Paterson Colt .36 on his hip . He simply waited . The Greek came forward , the knife low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai , Singapore , Amurang , and Taku Bar . The man moved well , held his knife low , cutting edge up . The man came on , the knife in his right hand . He would thrust and cut to the left , Sean was sure . Hands ready , he waited . The Greek suddenly feinted , lunged , and thrust . Sean side-stepped quickly to the left and saw the blade sweep to his right , and then Sean slashed at the Greek 's ear with the edge of his hand . It was a chopping , backward blow that landed solidly and staggered the Greek . He missed a step , and Sean turned quickly . Dazed , the Greek was almost as quick . Sean feinted , the Greek thrust wildly , and Sean hit him solidly on the chin with a right . The Greek 's knees folded and Sean stepped in and kicked him on the chin . The knife went flying , and the Greek hit the dust and fell back . Sean walked calmly to him , jerked him half erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punch with vicious force . Then dragging him by the scruff of the neck he took him to a saddled horse , obviously belonging to one of the invaders . " Take him , and get out . " It was cool and quiet inside the adobe ranch house . Eileen Mulkerin paused in the living room and looked slowly around . Nothing had changed , this was her home . It wasp107familiar , bare by some standards , but it was home and she loved every inch of it . " Did you have trouble , Michael ? " " No . They did n't quite know what to do about me . " He smiled . " There is an advantage in being of the Church , Senora . I just sat and they let me be after a few minutes of argument . " He got to his feet . " I must go now . I have duties . " " Of course , but will you tell everyone there is to be a fandango here , a week from Friday ? " Michael glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fandango ? Of course . " When he had gone she turned to Mariana . " Come . You can help me . " Sean Mulkerin walked outside , squinting his eyes against the glare of the sun on the hard-packed clay of the yard . Heat waves shimmered , and he glanced toward the corral , then the hills around . His mother 's strategy was good , of course . Nobody would dream they did not have the money . She would spend a little of the gold , say nothing , and let them imagine how much she had . Wooston would probably demand immediatepayment , but he would get little sympathy from the Californios who would now be sure she had the money and would permit him to take no action . Sean knew from past experience how they thought . They would simply say , " You know she has the money . When she is ready , she will pay . Do nothing . " Sean Mulkerin climbed the low mountain near the ranch and looked toward the sea . The Lady Luck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner to have it closer in case of need . Sean checked his gun again . Despite his mother 's reassurances , he was worried . Zeke Wooston was not like the men she had known , and he might not be susceptible to public pressure.  |p108They  had lost him back in the hills but he would return and the men he had with him were not the kind to be easily turned from their purpose . They wanted the Malibu , and they would try by every means to get it . Montero was braiding a rawhide riata when he walked back down the footpath to the adobe . " We 're going to need a couple of hands , " he said quietly , " men we can trust . " Montero nodded . " I have them . They are coming . " " You 've already sent for them ? " " Before you returned I knew they would be needed . These are good men , tough men . " " When will they be here ? " " Today , tomorrow . . . who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be riding to the pueblo , to Los Angeles . It was the thing to do now , to go in , to spend gold , to invite all to the fandango , the families of Sepulveda , Lugo , Verdugo , Abel Stearns . . . all of them . In the meantime , life must go on , and Sean had to plan for the future of the ranch . Ground must be plowed , crops seeded . Many of the Californios were content to live as they always had , their cattle running wild upon thousands of acres , growing their few crops , existing in a pleasant sort of never-never land where all was peace and contentment and nobody had to struggle too much . That was the trouble with California in the 184o 's . The life was too easy , there was no necessity for struggle , and men must struggle or they deteriorate . His thoughts returned to the gold . If they had come to that area for gold , then the gold must have been washed from the stream close to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Senora had said there was no evidence of mining close by , although the cave itself showed some signs of work , very ancient work . Scowling he walked to the end of the porch and stood there , leaning against the pole at the corner.  |p109There  was no other way . He must go back . He must find the place to which Juan had taken his mother , bury Juan 's body , and look for the gold . In the meantime he must start things moving here in a more practical way . Men had spent their lives looking for lost mines or treasures and found nothing . He would not take that route . First he would set the wheels in motion . There were several thousand head of cattle on the Malibu . If he could round up all over six years old , get the hides and tallow , he would have a beginning . Besides , he had an idea of getting a bull from the Mormons at San Bernardino . He had seen their cattle , all bigger , fatter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two he could breed his own herd , for while beef was a drug on the market now , it might not always be . In the meanwhile there was some seed left from their planting venture . They could try that . He would ride up the coast and talk to the Chumash . They had rarely come to the ranch since his father died , but it was a contact that must not be lost . Through them he might establish connections with Indians from the interior who had furs to trade . There was no time to waste . " Jesus , " he said , as Montero approached the porch , " let the word get around that we will trade for furs . I want to reach the mountain Indians . " Montero said , " I think this is good . " He paused . " Capitan , two men have come . They are not strangers to me although I have not seen them before . " " What sort of men ? " " Vaqueros , Capitan . They are good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He paused again . " They are also good men for the fight . " " Where do they come from ? " " Sonora , Capitan . At least , that was the last place , but one of them was once in the army with your father . "  | " I will see them . " An hour later they rode up to the ranch . They came up the trail at full gallop , pulled up before the ranch house , and swung down . Both were obviously magnificent horsemen . The older man , whom Sean immediately knew must be the one who had served with his father , was broad and thick , but with muscle , not fat . " Cabeza Del Campo , " he said , introducing himself , a sly glint in his eye . " I was a sergeant with your father , Senor . Four years I rode with him , from the time I was sixteen until I was twenty . " " Since then ? " His eyes twinkled . " I have lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , scarcely more than a boy . He was lean and hard , showing more Indianthan Spanish . " Antonio Polanco , Senor . I would serve you . " " It is hard work here , " Sean told them , " and there may be fighting . Loyalty is of first importance . When you no longer wish to work here , come to me and speak . You can go then . " " It is understood . " " Our enemies outnumber us . They are shrewd and intelligent . We want no violence , but if you are attacked or the people here or the place are endangered , fight . If you fight , win . If the odds are too great get out gracefully if you can . There is always another day . " " Si Senor . It is understood . " He glanced from one to the other . " My mother is in commandhere . After her there is me , and after me , Jesus Montero . It is understood ? " " It is . " Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do not look for other men . I think these two will be enough . " Del Campo glanced at Polanco . " Did you hear that ,  |p111amigo  ? " he spoke softly . " He says we are enough . So it must be " In the rough country east of Pine Mountain , Zeke Woostonand his group twice lost their way . Disgruntled and irritated they finally made camp only a few miles from their starting point . " You was supposed to be a tracker , " Wooston said irritably to Silva . " A tracker , Senor , but not a man who knows this country . You wished to go back by a shorter way , it is a way that is strange to me . In the morning  --  " " In the morning I will lead us out , " Wooston declared . " Where 's King-Pin ? " Silva shrugged . None of the others knew either . " Franciscois with him , " somebody said . " They turned into a wrong canyon , perhaps . " Wooston was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they might run into . The long trek through the mountains and their failure to follow the widow and her son had angered him . There was too much delay . He had cargoes coming in within the week and he wanted no trouble with anyone when they landed on the coast . He had already advised them that the Malibu would be his , that they could come in safely at that point . Suddenly a fierce anger rose within him . He was a man who could not abide frustration , and this damned Irish woman and her cub had " Beltran ! " Beltran was a man he had watched closely . Although Beltran did not know it , Wooston had checked his backgroundenough to know he was a murderer , had been a bandit , and was wanted by the law at a dozen places in Mexico . He was an excellent shot , good with any weapon , and a fine horseman . He rode with Velasco , and they made a nasty team.  | " Senor ? " Wooston looked into Beltran 's black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deadly as a rattler . " Take Velasco , " he drew two gold eagles from his pocket , " and kill Senora Mulkerin and her son , the captain . Do you understand ? " Beltran shrugged . He fingered the two coins in his hand . " What is this ? " he asked softly . " This gold ? It is not enough , Senor . " " You will get more when it is done . There will be four more pieces of gold for each if it is done within the week , and if you are caught , it was a robbery you attempted .. . nothing more . " " Si . " Beltran walked to Velasco . He handed him a gold piece , then explained . " Good ! We will do it . . , but carefully , amigo . Very carefully . " " It is not a good thing , " Velasco said , " to kill a beautiful woman . Perhaps it would be better if  --  " " He said kill . It is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . very quickly . Then we will rob them and there is San Francisco . " " Of course , " Velasco said carelessly , but he was thinking his own thoughts.  |p113In  the pueblo of Los Angeles the houses were of adobe , their almost flat roofs plastered with asphalt from the tar pits at Rancho La Brea . There were many trails into the town , most of them old Indian trails that had been found useful . There was a guardhouse in the town , and a church , a few trading posts and stores , here and there a cantina . A scatteringof homes lay along the various roads and streets , and the population was about fourteen hundred , depending on the season or the time of day . The trail from Malibu to the pueblo lay along the shore for a few miles , then joined with the old Indian trail from the coast , to the tar pits , to the town , usually called El Camino Viejo . . . the old road . Eileen Mulkerin rode into the dusty street on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched and a fine sense of pride . She rode with style , a style the Irish have carried with them to many far lands . She rode sidesaddle , her flaring skirt draped effectively , and to see her no man would havep114dreamed that she had two tall sons , or that the man who rode beside her was one of them . They turned into the street , her black horse prancing a little and stopped before the door of a trading post . Sean swung down and offered his hand to his mother , and she stepped down like a princess . The two vaqueros tilted their sombreros and looked about with the confidence of men who know their strength and for whom they ride . Eileen swept through the door Sean held aside for her and entered the post . She glanced around , smiled at the storekeeper who almost dropped his broom and hastily straightened the leather apron he wore . " Yes , Senora ? " She placed her order before him . " I will pay , " she said quietly , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little coin in California , and less gold . Men paid in hides , tallow , furs , or in whatever they might have to trade . " Gold ? " The merchant was startled . " In gold , " she repeated , dropping the remark carelessly while looking at some fabric on the counter . She ordered quickly , moving from one counter to the next , wasting no time . She ordered food , wine , dress material , several imported delicacies rarely found in California , and then she paid for it with small nuggets . " We are entertaining , " she said then , " a small fandango . Will you tell our friends ? I shall send riders . . . but you know how it is , and someone might be missed . " " Of course , Senora . " He swallowed with some difficulty as he gathered the nuggets and weighed them . " I have not seen so much gold since . . . since . . . . " " My husband was here ? " she shrugged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold , I mean . One does not have it close by , and it is rather a bother . " I must have more mules , " she added , " for the next time . " " Yes , yes of course . " There was respect in the merchant'sp115eyes . " Perhaps Don Abel Stearns , or Senor Wolfskill will have mules to sell . . . or loan . " " Oh , yes , they might have . " Eileen Mulkerin gathered her skirts . " Will you have this ready ? Our cart will be here soon to pick it up . " " Of course ! Of course ! " They would all be there , of course , and there were forty or fifty foreigners in the vicinity now . William Wolfskill had been a trapper , now he owned a vast ranch and was growingoranges to ship . Don Benito Wilson , Hugo Reid , Don Juan Temple , William Workman , John Rowland , had also come west and most of them had married daughters of old California families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk outside . Her eyes swept the dusty street . It was a far cry from Dublin or Cork , far different from London and Paris , yet she loved the old adobes where the whitewash was peelingfrom the bricks , the dogs lay comfortably in the dust , wagging lazy tails at the occasional passing rider . Three riders came down the street , handsome boys scarcely into their teens , yet already magnificent horsemen . All three were richly dressed , and they bowed to her with decorum and a certain flair that was all their own . Two of them were Sepulvedas , and the third was Antonio Yorba . She knew she could expect them at the fandango , for they never missed anything of the sort , and people of all ages came , for there were no parties for the young , the middleaged , or the old . All gathered together , falling into their various groups at times , and mixing at other times . The Californios were great dancers and they possessed a manner and style like nothing she had seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good to see you ! " She turned quickly . Pio Pico was a somewhat portly man , shrewd and kindly , always active in local affairs.  | " I have been shopping , Senor . You will come to our fan-dango ? " " This is the first I had heard . A fandango is it ? But of course ! " Even Pio might be fooled by the gold , but he would wish to be fooled , for he had been a friend of Jaime 's , and was a friend of hers . " You have had trouble , Senora ? " " Senor Wooston has a small debt . He wishes to take the ranch ! It is absurd , is it not ? I shall pay him , of course , but the gold takes time , and at this season there is much to do . It is not , " she added glibly , " as if we did not have it . Jaime always found enough to handle such affairs , but Sean has been away , and with Michael in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , you will not lose the ranch . Of course not . " His eyes twinkled a little . " And what a time for a fandango ! Beautiful , Senora ! Simply beautiful ! " There was no fooling Pio , of course . Her chin lifted a little and she smiled impudently . " I thought you would approve , Don Pio , and would you please pass the word to all our friends ? There will be much to eat , wine to drink , and there will be dancing ! " After a few minutes more , she watched him go up the street , pleased that she had scored a point in her favor , for in Los Angeles the word of Pio Pico counted for a great deal and public pressure was something not even Zeke Wooston would dare to challenge . Her fandango would be popular with the pleasure-loving Californios , and the knowledge that she had money , even if not readily available , would make any move to force her from the ranch decidedly unpopular . Too many were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of the wealthiest saw little actual money from one year to the next . Most of the Americans or Europeans who had come to California had married into local families , had become Mexican citizens , and adoptedp117the ways of the community . Wooston had stood aside from all that and was not popular . Nor was his connection with Micheltorena popular . The governor had made enemies , and his refusal to curb the excesses of the army was making him more enemies . The casual , easy-going Californios could handle their own affairs , and on more than one occasion had banded together to pursue horse thieves or fight off attacks by bands of Indiansfrom the desert . Sean left his mother talking to a woman on the street and walked to the corner . Despite the Senora 's confidence , he was worried . Zeke Wooston was not a Californio and did not have the tolerant , somewhat casual attitude that was typical of them . Fernandez was a dangerous man , ready to take any advantage , as was Russell . Tomas Alexander ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more dangerous . Sean 's eyes searched the street . The pueblo was small , but there were many places where a man might keep out of sight . He glanced at Wooston 's office , but there was no sign of movement , no activity . It could be possible they had not yet found their way from the mountains . He turned on his heel and strolled back the way he had come . His mother turned to him , and he was again struck by her great beauty . If there was gray in her hair it was not visible , and if there were lines on her face he could not see them . " Come , Sean . We will go back . I wish to stop along the way . " The air was clear , the sky blue . He looked again to the hills where no clouds gathered . The Santa Monicas curved around , and in the distance he could see other mountains lifting their raw backs against the sky . This was home , this sunny land along the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the place where he planned to live out his years , and he wantedp118no other . Yet he could see the changes that were coming , although many of the Californios still lived in their dreams of a peaceful , quiet world secluded from all that lay outside . The coming of such men as Stearns , Wilson , Wolfskill , and the others should have been a warning of what lay ahead . These were hard but honest men , energetic and accustomed to competition and the drive to succeed , and their coming could not help but bring changes . It was these changes for which they must prepare . In a land where the sun shone nearly every day of the year , where cattle ran the hills in thousands , where anythinggrew almost without effort , it was too easy to sit back and relax . The trouble was that the men from eastern America and Europe who were now coming had lived in no such easy land and loved the struggle for existence . His mother had grasped that at once , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them out and doing , and their Californio neighbors smiled at their energy as one smiles at an excited child . He remembered what the Senora had said , " Remember , Sean . These men are different . They have come and they like it here , and more will come . They will move fast , theywill work hard , and in the end they will own it all . " In New England and in northern Europe the seasons were short and the air brisk . One had little time to do what needed to be done . In California the seasons merged , dreamed one into the other , and what was not done today could be done tomorrow . Sean looked again along the street and eased his Paterson into a better position on his hip . He helped his mother to her saddle and handed her the reins . Del Campo and Polanco came from a cantina and swung to their saddles . A man came from the cantina behind them , and Del Campo turned his mount to face him . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I speak when I wish . I do not now wish . " He was a surly fellow with a knife scar over his right eye and what looked like an old powder burn on his right hand . Del Campo walked his horse slowly forward . " Do not forgetme when you wish to speak , " he said gently . " I shall be listening . " He smiled , showing white , even teeth . The scarred man only stared at him , unsmiling . Del Campo wheeled his horse , stirring a cloud of dust , then he galloped after the Senora . Polanco had stayed off to one side , apparently unaware , but the man with the scarred face was not fooled . Fernandez came from the cantina behind him . " Who are they , Diego ? I do not know them . " " Nor I , but they are bad , amigo , ver ' bad . I feel it . They are no strangers to the knife , not those . " Fernandez walked back inside , spurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wooston sat with Tomas . " It is talked about everywhere , " he said . " The Senora has spent gold . She will give a fandango . She has bought much , ordered more , and paid in gold . " Wooston swore . He swore slowly , bitterly , emphatically , giving the words an ugly twist . " Gold ! And we were that close ! " " The fandango , " Fernandez said , " will bring them all to her house . You can do nothing , Senor . " " I 'll show them ! By the Lord Harry , I 'll  --  ! " He broke off suddenly . " Has King-Pin come in ? " " No , Senor . Nor Francisco . I think they look for the gold , Senor . " " Then they 'd better come here with it ! By God , I did n't hire them to go runnin ' off when they 're needed . " Fernandez shrugged . " Maybe they can not come , Senor . Maybe they are dead . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " What 's that mean ? " " The Old One , " Fernandez said . " Follow him into thep120mountains and sometimes you come back , sometimes not . " " Nonsense ! " Fernandez shrugged . " Perhaps , Senor . It is odd , I think that they never find them . . . not even the bodies . . . they find nothing . "  |p121King-Pin  Russell rode into a clearing and drew up , waiting for Francisco . He had become aware that despite his companion'sseeming boldness , he was dropping back more and more , and it made Russell uneasy . He sat very still , listening . That was it . . . the silence . Why could n't there be some sound ? What was it about these mountains ? About this place ? He turned in his saddle , looking all about . There were only mountains , only rocky , brush-covered or pine-clad hills . There were canyons or draws here and there that led to .. . what ? Nothing , probably . Just back to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . He wet his lips , considered , and after a bit lifted his canteen and unscrewed the cap for a short drink . He rinsed his mouth carefully , holding it there for a time , then swallowed . His eyes were busy . The gold must be up here . This was where they had come , and from somewhere up here they had turned back . If he could find the source of that gold . . . to hell with Woostonp122and the rest of them . He 'd take a bit of it , enough of it , and ride right out of here for the north . He could hole up somewherearound Monterey until he could get a ship . Then after awhile he 'd come back for more gold . By that time Zeke Wooston would be , hopefully , out of the picture . Francisco ? He spat . To hell with Francisco . The Mexican would probablytry to kill him as soon as they located the gold but he would do it first . Then he 'd get out by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Francisco appeared , easy in the saddle . " Where y ' been ? I figured you was lost . " Francisco shrugged . " I thought my horse had thrown a shoe . It had n't though . It took me just a little while . " No use arguing . Of course , Francisco was lying . He simply wanted to bring up the rear far enough back so that any trouble that came upon them would strike Russell first . Well , so be it . " Run out of tracks ? " King-Pin asked . " They surely come this way . " Francisco rode past , made a wide sweep , came up with nothing , and began at once to search more carefully . Still nothing . Contemptuous at first , he now became irritated . Yet he could find no tracks . Suddenly a stone fell down among the rocks , bounding from rock to rock . And in that instant , Russell 's gun was out and ready . Francisco looked on thoughtfully . Very fast .. . very , very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same quiet as before . Not simply a stillness , but a total absence of sound . Sweat trickled down the back of Russell 's neck . He mopped it with his bandanna , then pointed . " I figure they went along the back side of the mountain . " Francisco looked at the direction with no relish . Dark pine forests alternating with rocky slopes . Not good riding ,  |p123any  of it , and beyond broken crags along a ridge and great tumbled slabs of rock . " You 're the tracker , " Russell suggested . " You 'd better lead off . " Francisco walked his horse forward , scouting a waythrough the rocks . They had gone a quarter of a mile before he suddenly said , " Hal " and pointed . Russell saw it , after a moment of searching . The cut made by the outer edge of a horse 's shoe . It was the trail . He looked ahead with misgiving , but followed on . If there was gold he meant to have it . He had covered country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why did this give him that edgy , haunted feeling ? Why did he feel that unseeneyes were watching him ? They rode into the pines , a dark , silent place where they wove a slow trail among the pillared trunks . On these trees the growth only started when high off the ground , yet there were other pines here with gray-green , long needles . The trail dipped down , then went up between the rocks and among a thicker stand of pines . Twice they lost the trail , twice they found it again more by chance than by good sense . On their left ahead of them was a great gouged-out hollow in the ridge . The trail seemed to stop there , and Francisco , casting about , suddenlycalled him . King-Pin walked his horse over to him . The ground was marked and scarred by horse tracks . Here the horses had been tied , evidently for some time . " They walked , " Russell said . " It ca n't be far now . " Francisco looked slowly about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in shadow now . Darkness came swiftly in these closed-in places where ridges held off the light . " We 'd better camp . We 'll find it in the morning . " Russell got down . A thin trickle of water came down from the hollow . He tasted it . . . not bad . " All right , " he said.  |p124He  was a tough , bitter man with no loyalties , and no ideals . He wanted money for gambling , for women , for power . Yet the few times he had money it had not lasted , and he was left with nothing . He dreamed of the big strike , the big success that would leave him with money for everything . He had not grasped the fact that he was one of those to whom success was a stranger because he lacked persistence . He was forever grasping at chances to get rich in one swift move , and failure taught him nothing . He sneered at the vaqueros who herded cattle for other men , he had only contempt for hard-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the poorest lived better than he did , year in and year out , and without fear of the law . He had courage and skill with guns . He had belief in his ability to outfight any man and believed himself smarter than most , with no evidence whatever to prove it . He had worked for a number of other men who planned crimes and always for smaller pay than he had expected . In his life there was always a Zeke Wooston who somehow skimmed the cream , but he never asked himself why this was so . He invariably pictured those who were successful as lucky or thieves who stole what they had by devices imagined but unknown . Now he was sure he would find the gold . He never doubted the legend of the gold because to doubt it would mean to doubt his whole existence . The gold had to be there , but if somehow he failed to get it he would shift quickly to another treasure to be stolen . As for Sean Mulkerin , Russell had no doubt he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prefer it to be with guns . He was wary only of Wooston , for Woostonwas more than a danger to be faced . He was a shrewd , conniving man . If Russell respected any man it was Wooston . In California , as in many other lands , death could be bought , and Wooston had money and was friendly withp125Captain Nick Bell . Russell knew far too much about Bell for comfort . Bell could kill , or have someone killed because he was the law . Each man carried a little food and they prepared it now . They had eaten and were drinking coffee by the fire when they heard the sound . At first it seemed far off , then close by . It sounded like someone chanting , but no words could be distinguished . Francisco crossed himself quickly , and Russell shifted his cup to his left hand and reached for his rifle . He glanced over his shoulder and saw nothing but the darkness beyond the circle of firelight . The sound vanished , and Russell wet his lips with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it was no wind that he had ever heard before . " Funny sound , " he said , trying to keep his tone casual . " What could it be ? " Francisco shrugged , looking carefully around him . " I do not know , Senor . I think when morning comes it is better we go from here . " " You joking ? You mean leave without the gold ? " " Sometimes gold is very expensive , Senor . Perhaps the gold belongs to ghosts . Perhaps only the Old One knows these ghosts . " " I do n't believe in ghosts , " Russell said , wondering if the statement sounded as hollow as it was . He did not , he told himself , believe in ghosts . . . but what was that sound ? Maybe wind in the rocks . . . but there was no wind . Maybe contraction caused by the chill of evening , but inwhat ? Where ? " Let 's get some sleep , " he suggested . But he did not feel at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stacked it near the fire . " Zeke must be back to Tomas ' cantina already , " he said , wishing he was there also.  | " I think so , " Francisco agreed . The Mexican was staying close to the fire , too . Francisco arranged his blankets near the fire , then lay down . He did not , Russell noted , remove his boots . " I think tomorrow I will go back , " Francisco said . " What 's the matter ? You scared ? " Francisco looked at him . " Like you , Senor . There is gold that is not for human hands to touch . I am thinking this is such gold . " " The Mulkerins touched it . They took some of it a couple of times . " " The Old One is their friend . " " You 'll feel different , come daylight . " " Perhaps , Senor . But I hope I am not such a fool . " Resting his head on his arm , he closed his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan the darkness . Anything might be out there ... but what was he ? A scared kid ? There ai n't such things as ghosts . He added wood to the fire and rolled up in his blankets , a pistol in his hand . The fire crackled , a low wind moaned in the treetops , somewhere a stone rattled . He awoke suddenly . He did n't know how long he had been asleep . He lay quiet , listening . The night was still , but suddenly he caught a faint sound of hoof beats . Faint and far-off , but hoof beats . He sat up quickly and looked around and in an instant he knew what had happened . He had known , instinctively , since he heard those first far-off sounds . Francisco was gone . He reached for his gun , started to rise . In a moment of blind rage he wanted only to pursue Francisco and kill him , but he realized his chances of overtaking the Mexican were slight . The man knew this country better than he , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few sticks and built up his fire . Dawn was far away.  |p127The  coffeepot was still at the edge of the coals so he nudged it closer . He tugged his boots on , stood up , and stamped his feet . He picked up his gun and slid it into the clumsy holster . His rage subsided and he decided it was the best thing that could have happened . Now he alone would find the gold , and he alone would know where it was . That is , he and the Mulkerin outfit . He could take care of that in due time , if Zeke Wooston did not . He would wait until daylight , then hunt for the place where the Mulkerins had gotten their gold . He would load up whatever he could carry and start for the coast . He could even ride back to Los Angeles , tell Wooston that Francisco had left him and that he 'd had a bad time finding his way out of the hills . Let them think he had found nothing . The night now seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He added more wood to the fire , drank more coffee , and saddled his horse . When he returned to the fire a faint light was showing in the east . An hour later he was riding . The tracks were plain here , tracks coming out of that hollow , that horseshoe-like place in the mountain wall . He rode his horse as far as he could , watered it at the small creek , then tied it on a small patch of grass . Taking his rifle he started up the creek . It was an hour before he found the cave . The terrace before it puzzled him . Flat as a floor , free of all large stones , packed very solid as if rolled by something heavy . It looked like some sort of a working area and it puzzled him . When he saw the cave he was wary . Rifle ready , he approachedit . He spoke , and there was no reply . His lips felt dry and he glanced around , seeing nothing . His eyes swept the high rim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap ?  |p128He  was thinking like a kid again . He stepped into the cave and stopped . On the packed sand of the cave floor lay Juan , the Old One . He lay perfectly still as if he had merely closed his eyes . Russell touched his hand . . . cool . . . not really cold . Was he dead ? Russell lifted an eyelid . The Indian was dead , all right . Straightening up , he glanced around . Seeing the pots he checked them . . . empty . From one he shook a tiny fleck of gold dust . Damn ! Was that all there was ? He started to turn away and suddenlyfelt a chill go through him . The body was gone.  |p129For  an instant he stood riveted , a cold prickling traveling along his spine and up the back of his neck . His tongue , gone suddenly dry , fumbled at drier lips . Very slowly , he lowered his hand to his gun . He was having trouble breathing , as though he had been struck suddenly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a trapped animal , moved warily from side to side fearful of what they might see . The cave was empty . There was nothing there , nothing at all . He did not move . His muscles seemed stiff , and when he tried to swallow he had to struggle to do it . Carefully , he drew his gun . The cave mouth was empty , outside there was sunlight . He crouched down , his back against the cave wall . His eyes went again to the place where the Old One 's body had lain . The marks of it were there . That , at least , had not been an illusion . The marks were there , and something else he must not have noticed before . The tracks of sandals . . . Of woven sandals . His tongue managed to wet his dryp130lips . He could see the marks of two sets of sandals on either side of the place where the Old One had lain . Sandals ? That was silly . He was imagining things . Those tracks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must have been . Only they were not . He straightened up slowly . No use staying here , the gold was gone . It was time to get out . Yet the gold must have come from here , from somewhere around . Gold did not just appear out of thin air . He told himself that , several times . Circling to avoid the spot where the old man 's body had been , he eased out of the cave mouth into the sunlight . All was quiet . The terrace outside was empty . It was very flat , right down to the edge of the creek . Like a floor . Maybe it had been a floor at some time . He mopped his face with a handkerchief and squinted his eyes against the morning sun . Heat waves shimmered beyond the terrace . He 'd never seen them so close before . Heat waves usually only showed themselves at some distance . He mopped his face again and looked slowly around . No signs of mining , no arrastra , no rusted picks or shovels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body gone to ? He must go . He wanted to get away from here , far , far away , yet there was a deep-seated fear within him .. . would they let him go ? And who were they ? He still held the pistol in his hand . He walked slowly , putting each foot down carefully , walking as if in a trance , back to the trail . Only he could not seem to see the trail . It was here . . . right here . Brush , bare sand , some scattered rock , but no trail . Surely he had come in from the east ? Of course , he could see thep131great gap in the mountain over there . He stumbled into the brush . Just head for that gap and he 'd find his way out . What could have happened to that trail ? Of course , it was probably just behind some brush , he 'd just cut too short or something . He would come upon it any time now . Anyway , there was the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse was . It was very hot in the brush where no breeze could reach him . He started to hurry , sweat streaked his face , ran down his body under his shirt . He stumbled , almost went to his knees and straightened up . There was a bush right before him . He must have turned halfway around when he almost fell . He changed direction , pushed his way between clingingbushes and thrust on . Suddenly he came up short . He had faced around and was heading back . He mopped his face , stared wildly around and plunged on again . When he fought himself free of the brush his shirt was torn . He had been carrying his pistol in his hand and now he thrust it back in the holster . He stood in a small open space among clumps of brush and trees , panting for breath . God , but it was hot ! He stared around him . Where the devil was that trail ? Due to the height of the brush he could no longer see the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , then paused . On the sand , right before him , were the distinct tracks of sandals . Two feet , side by side . Only they stood where no man could have stood due to the bulge of the brush . They were there , as if someone had stood there only a moment before , looking at him . He turned away , found a space between trees and walked through . Ahead of him there was a flat rock about waist high , standing between two trees . A third tree was behind it , and the rock looked almost like a stone picnic table . Or a butcher 's block . Or an altar . Or both.  |p132He  had started forward to sit down on it , wanting a rest . Now he backed away , until the brush brought him up short . An altar ? What kind of a silly thought was that ? An altar in such a place as this ? Of course , he supposed , the Indians might have used altars . He had little idea of how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . what happened to that body ? And those sandal tracks ? Still , the place where a rock had been lying might look something like a sandal track , or a lot of things might have caused it . Anyway there were no Indians around here . Francisco said that . But Francisco was gone . He had fled in the night . Why ? King-Pin Russell looked again at the altar . Then for the first time he realized that three tracks came out of the woods leading up to the altar . Like the tracks of a gigantic turkey three trails emerged from the brush and ended at the altar , if altar it was . He mopped the sweat from his face and neck . Which way to go ? Damn it , how could he have lost that trail ? If he could only see over the brush , locate the gap . After all , it was the only way out . If he could locate the gap he had only to go down the slope to it . He looked around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would bear his weight . The highest place and the best footing were on the altar . He started toward it , then stopped , a curious reluctance coming over him . What kind of a damn ' fool you gettin ' to be ? he asked himself . You 're like a kid or some silly woman . He rested his hands on the altar , then vaulted easily to the top . Standing on tiptoes he peered over the brush and saw the gap . . . just over there . His vision blurred . He shook his head , feeling slightly dizzy and nauseous . What was the matter , anyway ? Heatp133waves shimmered and the horizon became vague , unreal . What was the matter ? What was happening to him ? He swayed , clutched at the empty air , and fell . He seemed to fall for a long , long time , then smashed against the ground . The earth seemed to tip and roll and he clutched at it , his brain spinning in slow , dipping rolls . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , but his thoughts would not focus . He lifted his head and the heat waves shimmered and the trees showed through them , but there was no solidity anywhere , not in the trees , nor yet in the mountains . He was neither wholly conscious nor unconscious and yet vaguely he seemed to see the shimmering air , seemed to hear the shuffling sounds of sandals , seemed to see the unreal shapes of Indians in the dancing heat waves . Were they near or far ? Were they real or only figments of his distraught mind ? The Indians , like no Indians he had ever seen , came slowly from the heat waves . " He pursued the Old One , " one said . " He was the enemy of the Senora , " another said . " He is evil , " said a third . " If he goes now he will tell others of this place , " the first one said . " So he must not go , " said the second , " not for a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he vaguely conscious , or was this a dream , a nightmare , a haunting unreality come to torture his delirium ? He felt hands grasp his arms and legs . He tried to move , and he could not . He felt himself lifted . . . carried . . . . Hilo came up from the schooner to help , and several of the Chumash , who had helped before , came to the ranch . They dug holes and sank posts , slender posts to hold upp134roofs made of tules for shade . The oak trees near the house offered shade also , and a space was roped off for the dancing . Sean rode out on the hill near Las Flores Canyon and shot three steers to be butchered on the spot . One was brought in upon a cart after the meat was dressed and hung up in the shade . Two were to be roasted upon spits . A dozen women had appeared , some from the homes of vaqueros , some from the pueblo , and they bustled about busy with a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiesta . After killing the meat and seeing that it arrived safely , Sean kept out of the way . At one side he spoke to Polanco . " It is a time to be careful , " he said , " we want no trouble , but if it comes  --  ? " " We will be ready , Senor . It is understood . " Tennison came up from the Lady Luck . " Down to Pedro , " he said , " there 's talk around . King-Pin 's disappeared . " " Disappeared ? " " He never came back from the mountains . Wooston is hinting he was killed , murdered . " " He probably just got lost . He would not be the first . " " No , he would n't . But that ai n't what Wooston has inmind . Wooston has n't said yet , so far 's I could make out , buthe sort of implies maybe it was you who did him in . " " Well , I did n't . " " Just figured you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fro , then said , " Cap'n , what does happen back in yonder ? " Sean shrugged . " Look ... it is mountain and semi-desert . There 's water if a man knows where to look , and if he does n't he can kill himself looking . If a man gets lost the best thing he can do is head west . Sooner or later he will come to the sea , if he lasts long enough . " " What about all this talk of ha'nts and such-like ? " " Who knows ? " Sean thought of the mountain valleys and canyons , so still , so alone , and yet " Every country has its secrets , and every people their superstitions . Who is to say what is and what is not true ? One of the stories current among the Indians is that they came out of a cave or a hole in the ground into this world . That may be pure symbolism . It may imply they were simply born of the earth , but it might mean just what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more you 're willing to believe anything the Indians believe . Walk up any one of those canyons alone and see how you feel . You wo n't go a hundred yards before you wonder if something is not watching . " You do n't get it in the open desert as much , but whereverthere are canyons , rocks , peaks and such , you get that feeling . Now maybe it is just a feeling . . . but maybe something is watching . " Once when the Old One talked to me he told me they knew about me , and they knew about the Senora , and they were friendly to us , but he did not tell me who they ' were . " " Knew a sailorman one time , he was a great talker , but he 'd been ' most everywhere . He allowed how there was other worlds right next to this one . . . something about time and space . . . I could n't make out just what he meant . He said he was a disciple of Pythagoras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could pass right from one world into the next , and maybe come back , too . Only the time was different . . . or could be different . " " I 've heard such talk . You get out in those hills alone and soon you are ready to believe almost anything . " He paused , listening to the pat-pat-i-pat-pat of women 's hands slapping tortillas . " Out east people talk of all manner of mysterious things . That 's India , China , and places like that , but they do n't know this country . The old people here ... I 'm not sure if they were what we called Indians or not .. they had their own mysteries . " You look at one of these Indians . Maybe he 's just a man who hunts wild game , plants a few crops , herds sheep orp136loafs around the village . . . but maybe he 's relative to something that 's old . . . older than any of our history , older than there 's any figure for . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ice . . . a glacier . But what was there before the ice came ? What would be left of an adobe house if a thousand feet of ice lay over it ? Grinding down , pushing , pulverizing . But there are some things that can not be lost as long as one man or woman exists , and that 's the memories of older times . " If the children do n't listen , of course , and if they do n't want to hear , then something is lost , but somewhere it lingers on . Somewhere there 's been a record left . . . if a man could find it . . . or if he was really sure he wanted to . " " Of course he 'd want to . If he had any brains he 'd want to . " Sean smiled wryly . " Maybe . . . and maybe not . As long as a man gets up in the morning , pulls on his pants , stomps into his boots , and goes about his business the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to delving . . . delving deep . . . well , there 's no telling what you 'll bring up . " One time off Cape Comorin at the southern tip of India we were becalmed for a few hours . We 'd been coasting down from Ceylon , figuring to round the cape and go up the coast to catch the trades across to Africa . Becalmed there , we tried dragging a net for fish . We got fish , all right , but we got some other stuff , too . We got some pieces of broken pottery . . . such pictures you never saw . . . and the hand and arm of a statue . It was carved from stone , beautiful thing , only the hand had six fingers . " " That 's funny , " Ten commented , " there 's a cave drawing back yonder above Malibu with a hand with six fingers . " Sean got up . " We 'd better go lend a hand , " he said quietly . And then he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several had six fingers . "  | " What 's it mean ? " Sean shrugged . " Must 've been a people one time who ran to six fingers . . . and they got around . One way or another . "  |p138On  the day of the fiesta the first of the guests arrived shortly after dawn . A group of six riding horseback from up the coast , they had camped on the shore the previous night and brought a fine catch of fish to contribute to the food supply . There were three women , one of them young and very bright-eyed and excited at the thought of the fandango . There was one man , an almost grown boy , and a small girl . From then on they came in a steady stream , a stream that never ceased until all the ranchos within miles were represented . The Senora was everywhere , superintending the preparation of food , the decorations , the shades , everything . Polanco came to Sean shortly before noon . " Senor ? There are men in the hills who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are they doing ? " " They watch , Senor . There is one who goes and comes back . He goes further back , toward the ridge . I think he meets with someone there . "  | " Thanks . Keep an eye on them , Polanco , and be ready . " The white teeth flashed . " I am always ready , Senor . It is that one wishes to live , no ? " Sean was standing in the shade when three men started across the yard toward him . They were lean men , and tall , with Mexican spurs and battered , flat-brimmed hats . One wore a buckskin vest , fringed in Indian fashion . " Howdy , Sean , " the speaker was a man with a narrow , raw-boned face and gray eyes that smiled easily . " Ai n't seen you for a spell . " " Johnny Mims ! I 'll be damned ! You back at El Monte ? " " Uh-huh . We run into some horse thieves out yonder . Had some shootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured to the men with him . " Reckon you rememberBill Honeycutt ? Well , this here 's Larkin Campbell . He joined up with us down on the Rio Grande last trip . " He glanced around . " Hear you been havin ' trouble . " " Money trouble , mostly , " Sean replied , " but Zeke Wooston is behind it . He wants this place . " " You have trouble and you do n't let us share it , you 're less of a friend than I think , " Mims said quietly . " We 've got no use for Wooston . In fact , those hoss thieves may have had a mite of help from around the pueblo . Maybe somebody promised to buy any stock they come up with . " " Do you know that ? " " Well , I got no evidence that will stand in a court of law , but then we ai n't just figurin ' on takin ' it to no court . Out yonder in the desert it 's a fur piece to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enjoy yourselves , boys , " Sean suggested . " There 's plenty to eat and drink , and the crowd 's a-gathering . " " We come along a pretty good gait , " Honeycutt said , " but we passed nearly fifty outfits between here an ' Rancho La Brea . " Suddenly Larkin Campbell spoke . " This here Ortega outfit ? Will they be comin ' to this shindig ? "  | " They probably will . Nobody misses a fiesta unless he 's sick or out of the country . Do you know them ? " " Only by name . I hear they make the finest riatas in the country , and I need me a new rope . " " They do that , " Sean agreed . " I like the four-strand for rough work , although they weave an eight-strand that 's beautiful to see . But they 'll be around , you can be sure of that . " Sean crossed to his mother who was arranging some flowerson a table under the tule-covered shade . " The boys from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing him a quick smile . " Keep them quiet , Sean . You know how they are . " He chuckled . " They just like a good time . All those Texans like to kick up their heels just to hear their spurs jingle . " Then he added , " They 've no love for Wooston . " " Good ! We can use friends . " All morning they came . Lugos , Avilas , Sepulvedas , and families who had been traveling for several days , stoppingat intervening ranchos , coming along slowly on horsebackor in the cumbersome carretas drawn by oxen . They were gaily dressed , their horses as beautifully caparisonedas themselves . By the time noon had come , two dozen carretas stood on the outskirts , and dozens of saddledhorses at the hitching rails . Others had been turned into the pole corrals . Here and there someone was singing , with a guitar , but the preparations continued , with much bustling to and fro by the women , many excited cries , and much laughter . Sean went inside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room , the only one in the house . Yet he had come there in part for a moment alone . Zeke Wooston would not doubt their possession of gold , of that he was sure . Wooston would not doubt it because it was his belief in that gold that made him want the ranch.  |p141The  smuggling , of course , was another reason he wanted the ranch . From the coast at Paradise Cove or any one of the several coves along the coast there was easy access to the interior by way of the canyons . From there goods could be brought into Los Angeles , and the demand was great . Moreover , most of the people in California did not look upon smuggling as a crime , for the laws against trade with foreigners were strict and goods hard to obtain from Mexico , and very expensive . Wooston would believe in the gold , but the fact that he would now expect them to pay the money owed would in no way stop him from seeking to acquire the ranch . Now that gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Wooston was not one to hesitate over something he wanted . He could use influence with Micheltorena , but there was little the governor could do . . . unless the Senora , Brother Michael , and he were dead . There would be no heirs , the ranch would be seized by the governor , and then they might gain possession . Yet Sean doubted if that was the means they would use . They would not want to trust even the governor , who might easily give the land to someone else or keep it in his own possession . Certainly , they would try to find some other way . He hitched his belt into a better set on his hips and scowled at the mirror . How ? And where was King-Pin Russell ? His thoughts returned to the matter of payment . They could now borrow the money , he believed , for everyone believed they had access to gold . Yet even if they could not borrow it they would have gained time , and time was what was needed . Yet he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trading voyage . They could , he believed , get together something of a cargo , partly from their own ranch , partly from others . There would be a profit if he went somewhere besides Mexico . Sitka ? The Russians to the north needed wheat , and they had furs to trade . Furs were in demand in China and on the East Coast . He checked the Paterson Colt . It was fully loaded and ready . He ran his fingers down his knife scabbard and glanced out through the open door . More people were arriving . Polanco had said some men were lurking in the hills . Who , and why ? Men of Wooston 's , without a doubt , but they might be men come to take Mariana away , and against them he would have little defense . After all , she had been betrothed to Andres . Her uncle had arranged it . For most of these people that would be sufficient , and he would be in the wrong . At the same time the romance of her flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched the people circulating . Musicians were tuning their instruments , trying a few bars of this song or that , and soon the dancing would start . He watched the crowd . It was a shifting , colorful scene , and one he loved . He was more of a spectator than a participant at these things , but he loved them nonetheless , yet there was an uneasiness upon him . It was the feeling he had sometimes before a bad storm at sea , when you could feel the weather making up . Yet this was no storm of that kind , this was something else entirely . Trouble was coming , and he did not know how or where . Wooston . . . Andres . . . it could be either . Or it could be King-Pin . Montero strolled over to him . " It is a good night for the dance , " he said quietly , " but I do not think it a good one for us. "  | " You feel it , too ? " Montero said nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the wind . . . or it is because we know it must come . I do not know what it is , but there will be trouble . " " I am glad Mims is here . " Montero chuckled softly . " He is a wild one , but a good man . I do not think he will be an old man . Not that one . But neither will a lot of others . " " The Old One is gone . " " Yes . . . he will be missed , I think . He was a good man . " " What did you know about him , Jesus ? " Montero shrugged . " No more than you , I think . He spoke once of a door one could pass through , that there were times to go and times to come , and that there were other worlds beyond . " He paused a moment . " The gold may have come through such a door . It may have been an offering . " Sean Mulkerin 's forefathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Celtic gods . Ireland is an old land where ghosts linger , and shadows of ancient memories are in the rocks and the fens . He had no superstitionsas such , yet he did not doubt there were things of which he knew nothing , and perhaps veils beyond which he could not see . " I do not know , " he said , " for whom such an offering would be made . " " Who knows , Senor ? Often the offerings to gods are made even when the names of the gods are forgotten . Habit is forever with us , I think , and the old beliefs may wither but they do not die . " They walked outside together and stood under the porch . Sean 's eyes went to the hills , brush-covered and silent in the sun . What eyes watched from there ? They seemed so innocent , yet he had found lonely places out there , ghostly in their silence . The dancing had begun . El Tecolero , the master of thep144dance , had begun it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , but his thoughts were not with them . There would be trouble , he knew it . He turned to speak to Montero , but the Californio was gone . Polanco was across the yard near the pole corral where the horses were . Johnny Mims was dancing , but Larkin Campbell and Bill Honeycutt were standing at one side , smoking and watching . Suddenly there was a rush of horses ' hoofs up the trail and several men , six or seven at least , rode up . Andres , on a splendid black horse , was in the lead . He rode magnificently . Tomas Alexander was there , and Fernandez . The others were a hard-bitten lot . Sean saw Honeycutt move a bit to one side to have a better view . Sean walked across the small dancing area , moving through the dancers . When he emerged from the crowd he was facing Andres . " It is a fandango , " he said quietly , " we dance here , and we sing . If you come for the dancing and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And if I do not ? " Andres ' eyes were cool but taunting . " Then you are not welcome , and as a caballero you would go away until the fiesta is finished . " " You teach me ? " " I remind you . " Andres laughed , but there was no humor in it . " All right , there shall be only the fiesta . " His white teeth flashed . " After that I shall kill you . " Sean Mulkerin smiled deprecatingly . " Of course , you will try . " He paused . " It is a pity when there are so many girls who like you to die for one who does n't . " Andres had started to turn , now he wheeled his horse . " It is not I who will die ! " Sean smiled in great good humor . " They always feel thatp145way until they taste the blade . Buenos tardes , Sercor ! " He turned away . From the coast road came the creaking and groaning of carretas arriving with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various colors , nearly all filled with girls or young men as well as the older people . Alongside each carreta there were usually several outriders wearing velvet suits with wide-bottomed , slashed pants , or beautifully tanned suits of white buckskin . Sombreros were the order of the day for the men . Many of the women were elaborately gowned , but some , if their trip had been a long one , brought clothes into which to change . The dancing had begun so many of the newcomersleaped from the carreta or the saddle into the middle of the dance . Sean moved from group to group , smiling , shaking hands , welcoming his guests . Andres , he noted , seemed to have dropped his anger at the gate and now mixed freely . Yet several of those who had come with him , notably Fernandez , hung upon the fringe of the crowd , glowering . Honeycutt had moved from near the corral to a position not far from Fernandez . He was a good hand with a guitar , but even during the moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fernandez . The others who had come from far-flung haciendas seemed unaware of the trouble . They were laughing , gay , friendly . Sean , who had helped the Lugos round up cattle and wild horses , who knew all those from the surrounding ranches , enjoyed meeting his friends . Andres , he decided , would probably live up to his agreementto create no trouble as long as the fiesta lasted , but he had made no promises beyond that . Wooston had made no promises at all , and Wooston was not present . So where was he ? From dance to dance they moved , and Mariana was in the thick of it all.  |p146Suddenly  Andres was beside her , and in a moment they were dancing together . And they danced well . Watching them , Sean felt a flash of irritability . Why did he have to come here ? Did she love him after all ? They were dancing la Bamba , and very well , too , a glass of water upon her head as she moved , spilling not one drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better than anybody he had seen , and there were fine dancers among the Lugos , Yorbas , and Estudillos . The young Mexican was quick , lithe , and unbelievably expert . Sean turned sharply away and went inside . His mother laughed at him . " Jealous ? You must not be . It is only the dance . " " But with him ! " " Why not with him ? He is a very good dancer . Anyway , if it is Andres she loved , then why not find out now ? But I think it is only the dance , and she is angry with him , she wants to show him a little , I think , what he is missing . " Suddenly Montero was in the room . " Senor ? Senora ? There is a man . . . he is by the corral . He would speak with you ! "  |p147Sean  Mulkerin turned sharply to follow , then hesitated . He glanced at Montero . " He is alone ? " Montero 's face was stiff , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor . One only . " A sound of hoofs from the trail turned him again . Dust arose , and through the dust a half-dozen men . Zeke Wooston , Captain Nick Bell , and several soldiers . Johnny Mims was beside him , from out of nowhere . " You got friends , Sean boy . Stand your ground . " " I do not want shooting here , " Sean said quietly . " We will have none . " " May not be that easy , " Mims said quietly . " I think they 've come for your scalp . " Nick Bell was no respecter of persons . He pushed his horse right across the crowded dance area , followed by his riders . They were a nondescript lot . Wooston looked pleased , too pleased . " Ah ? Sean Mulkerin , is it ? " Bell smiled . He was a hard man , utterly vicious , and completely sure of himself as an officer of the province . " You are arrested . We have come to take you to jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of King-Pin Russell , " Wooston replied . " You will be taken to jail . " " You have found him ? " Bell shrugged . " It does not matter , Senor Mulkerin . You were his enemy . He disappeared in the mountains where you were . We have men that will swear  --  " " I have no doubt of it , " Sean replied , " but do you have someone who will swear he is my enemy ? " " It was known ! He was riding in pursuit of you ! " " In pursuit ? Why was he pursuing me ? And why should he be my enemy ? If he rode into the mountains it was his own idea . " " He was following you , and he has not come back . You killed him . " Nick Bell leaned both hands on the pommel and smiled , a thoroughly unpleasant smile . " So you are to be taken to prison , " he smiled again , " where you will he questioned . " Bell was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , for they had shown nothing but contempt for him . Now it was his turn . Johnny Mims strolled a little closer . " You do n't need to go nowhere you do n't want to , Mulkerin , " he said quietly . " We got as many men as he has , and better ones . " Bell 's smile vanished . There was no fear in Bell and they all knew it . Thug he might be , but he had nerve . " You would go against the law ? I can bring more men and more . I can throw you all into prison . " Don Abel Stearns was standing nearby , so were two of the Lugos . His eye caught the movement as they drew closer . They were people of influence and judgment , and he did not like their presence here but there was nothing he could do . " Senor ? " It was Montero again . " I think you must see this man . The one by the corral . " He looked around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Bring him here , then . " " It can wait , " Bell said abruptly . " Do your business later . " " It can not wait , " Montero said . Nick Bell 's lips tightened with anger . " You talk to me , you cholo ? I 'll show  --  " " Stand where you are ! " Eileen Mulkerin 's rifle was on his chest , and the crowd gave way to give her a clear field of fire from her position on the porch . " Jesus Montero works for me . You lay a hand on him and I 'll kill you . " Bell stopped , staring at her . " Put that gun down ! " he snapped . " Couple of ' em over here , too , " Bill Honeycutt said mildly . " Be quite a contest to see who gets lead into you first , and how much . I figure I can , but Lark here , he always did figure he could shoot faster than me , so maybe it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether you ever seen her shoot or not . I seen her drop a rennin ' antelope seventy yards off with a quick shot . You 're closer an ' a bigger target . " Bell sat very still . He knew all about those Texans from El Monte . There were quite a few of them , a wild , roistering , hell-for-leather lot who respected courage and little else . They were hard workers , but troublemakers . And he had no doubt at all about their shooting . Several years before a small colony of them had moved in and settled there , and since then they had run cattle , a few had become farmers , and a few were in business . They were good people to leave alone . He was wary now . " All right , " he said crisply , " see to your business . " " Bring the man here , " Sean repeated , and Montero turned and walked away . For a few minutes they stood in uneasy silence . The music and the dancing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were drinking at the tables under the awning.  |p150Montero  came back around the corner of the house and he was walking beside an Indian who led a burro . Upon the burro 's back there was a man . . . an old , old man . They stared . Zeke Wooston suddenly dismounted and walked to the burro . He caught the old man by the arm , staring into his face . Then he dropped the arm as if burned and stepped sharply back . " Russell ! " he said , almost choking on the name . " By God , it 's King-Pin ! " They crowded around , helping the old man from the saddle . His clothing was ragged and old , and the man who wore them was only a shadow of the powerful King-Pin . He leaned against the burro , jaws agape , drooling a little , his eyes vacant and empty . " Zeke , " he muttered , " Zeke , I  --  " His voice trailed off and he stopped . They drew back from him , backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen a ghost . " That 's not Russell ! " Bell said sharply . " Russell was a young man . He could n't have been more than thirty ! This man . . . why he must be seventy or eighty years old ! " " That 's him , " somebody said . " Look at the notches on the gun ! Not more'n three weeks ago he was showin ' me them notches an ' that pistol . Ai n't many of them around , anyway . " Carlotta , the housekeeper , came from the house with a glass of wine . She handed it to the old man and he took it in fingers that trembled . " King-Pin , " Honeycutt said , " what happened to you ? " " Lost . . . lost , " Russell muttered . " I was lost . Trail disap . . . peared . There was an altar . . . I climbed on it to see . . . fell . Fell for a long time . Injuns got me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He raised his head and looked slowly around , his eyes staring and empty . " I do n't know . I just do n't know . "  | " Those Injuns , " somebody said , " they did n't take your gun ? " " Paid it no mind , " Russell said . Bell 's horse stepped forward . Are you Russell ? " he asked . " Walter Pendleton Russell . They call me King-Pin . I come from Lancashire to Carolina . I handled a freight team on the Santa Fe Trail . I come west . I  --  " his voice trailed off and he drank the wine , then dropped the glass , staring as it lay in the dust . " What about those Injuns ? " somebody asked from the crowd . " Was they Mohaves ' Paiutes ? " " Injuns . . . never seen the like . . . carried me off , dropped me . . . just lef ' me . " Tomas Alexander edged closer . " The Old One ? Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sand . " " The old man was silent for a few moments and then he said , " Cave . . . he was lyin ' there . I was huntin ' gold . . . turned around ... he was gone . " " Got up an ' walked out , " Wooston said . " Dead , " Russell muttered . " That was years . . . years back . I recall  --  " " King , " Wooston interrupted . " It was only a few days ago ! Just up in the mountains ! " The old man stared at him with weak , watery eyes . " Years . . . years back . I seen  --  " his voice trailed off . " Better let him sit down , " Sean suggested quietly . " The man is old , he is very tired . Lord knows what he 's been through . " " Eileen Mulkerin lowered her rifle . " Carlotta , take him inside . Give him some wine . Maybe he will eat something . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The music started again , and the dancing , but there was no heart in it . " That was King-Pin Russell , " Sean said quietly , to Nickp152Bell . " He 's alive , as you can see . You still want to take me in . " Bell shrugged . " He 's alive . . . if that 's him . " He looked curiously at Sean Mulkerin . " You were up there . What happened , anyway ? " " Who knows ? Looks like he 's aged fifty years . " " That is n't reasonable . " " No , Captain , it is n't . " Bell stared at him . " Mulkerin , you do n't believe all that damned nonsense , do you ? I mean , all that talk about what happens in the mountains ? " Sean shrugged . " Captain , what happens to one man in the mountains need never happen to another . The Indians lived here long before we came . Do you think it wise to dismiss all they know as superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , Captain , that none of us know too well , and none of us know it all . I can only say this . My mother went up there with the Old One . The Old One went to sleep on the floor of a cave , and when she called to him to leave , he was dead . " " And Russell found him there ? " " It sounds like it . " " He says the old man was carried off while his back was turned ? " " You heard him , so did I. Captain , there are places up there where the heat waves seem close up , everything is kind of indistinct and unreal . You ca n't judge distance properly , nor time either . " " What do you suppose happened to him ? " Bell mused . Sean shrugged again . " He says he fell . Maybe shock can do that to a man . Maybe he was carried off , taken somewherewe do n't even know about for . . . he says it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days . " " Do we ? A few days to us , maybe years to him . I am not going to try to explain it . I only know the Old One warnedp153my mother about wandering around . When she left , the trail was plain , but when Russell looked for it he could not find it . " " It does n't make sense , " Bell said irritably . He turned his horse and rode away , followed by his troopers . Zeke Wooston was at the door of the house , talking to the Senora . " But he 's one of my men ! " he protested . " I 'll take what care of him he needs . " " Let him have him , Senora , " Sean suggested . " We have no right to hold him . " " But he 's an old man ! He needs care ! " " Let them care for him , " Sean replied . " I do not think he will be around for long . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , " Sean replied . " Have you really looked at him ? " They turned . Russell sat at the table , his head hanging , his hands lax upon his knees . He seemed to have shrunken visibly . His face was seamed and old . Sean spoke , and after a moment the old man 's head lifted , but his eyes were unseeingand after a minute , they dropped . Wooston stared at the old man , then thought rapidly . Russell had found where the gold came from . He had actually seen the Old One , and if the old man had died there , it must have been the farthest they had gone . Surely , dying , he could have shown them no further along a trail . Russell , then , knew where the gold came from . Dying or not , he knew . And he could tell Wooston . The big man touched his lips with his tongue , then he smiled . " He was my friend . I will not leave him alone and helpless now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " Sean said . " He will need care . " Wooston hurried out , and for a moment Sean , the Senora and Russell were alone . " Russell ? " The old man looked up , if old man he could be called.  | " I was never your enemy . This . . . whatever happened . . I am sorry . " " I fell , " Russell muttered , talking as if to himself . " It was the altar . . . I should not have touched it . I . . . I felt it . . . I felt I should not , but . . . but I had to see ! " " It is all right , Mr. Russell , " Eileen said quietly . " We hold no grudge against you . You have suffered enough . " His body shook . " I was lost ... lost ! I could not find .. . there was no way ! Shimmering , shimmering , shimmering ! I got through . . . into something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lost . . . lost . " Everywhere there were bushes , bushes that clawed and tore at me , I fell again , and I do not know for how long I lay , I got up and suddenly I was back . I was on the hills above the sea , and the air was fresh and cool . I was back . I do not know how but I was back . " " He has lost his wits , " Wooston had come back into the room . " His mind is wandering . " " Whatever happened to him , " Eileen Mulkerin said , " should not happen to any man . " Wooston helped Russell to his feet and they started outside . Sean watched them go , then said to his mother , " I 've got to go back , you know . I 've got to be sure the Old One was buried . " " Russell said his body vanished . " " Perhaps . . . he might have been delirious even then . His mind does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do not believe that , Sean . " " No , I do n't , " he replied honestly . " We 'll never know what happened to him . Some terrible shock , or maybe some injury did this to him . . . or some experience . I 've heard of men 's hair turning white in a single night . " The musicians were playing again , and the mood of depressionbrought on by Russell 's unexpected return and the coming of Nick Bell had vanished . Suddenly it was a fiesta again.  |p155Sean  looked quickly around , caught the flashing black eyes of Mariana and moved through the crowd toward her . She looked up laughing , and together they moved off to the dancing . " It is over then ? " she asked , during a pause . " No , " he said quietly , " it is not over . Wooston has gone away , but when the crowd is gone , he will come back , and he still has men hidden up in the hills . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ? I think there will be . There will be trouble with Zeke Wooston and there will be trouble with Machado . . . he is not finished . " " I danced with him . " " I saw . " " He came and it was a challenge . " " So ? Do you want to go back with him ? You can , you know . " " With him ? No ! " Her eyes flashed at him . " I will stay .. . with you . " " And my mother , " he said , smiling . " I like her . . . your mother . She is a woman . " " Nobody could argue that point . Sometimes I wish  --  " " That she would marry again ? " " How did you guess ? " He paused . " Yes , I think so , but it would take a strong man , a very strong man , sure of himself . . . and calm . She has fire enough for two . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging . " Will you marry ? "  | " Someday , " he grinned , " someday when I can find a woman who will walk beside me . . . not behind me . " " I think she is not hard to find , this woman . I think you will find her . " Polanco was suddenly beside him . " Senor ? There are men upon the hills . . . more men . They have camped , and they wait . " " So ? " " Senor Wooston is among them . . . and Machado . " He glanced at her . " You see ? It is never over . I think someone must die first . " Johnny Mims had been listening to Polanco . " You know somethin ' , Sean ? I 'm powerful tired . Boney weary , I am . I think I 'll just sort of settle down an ' rest up . . . me an ' the boys . " Sean glanced toward the hills . There was a reflection of fire at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea stirred the leaves of the chaparral . " Polanco , " he suggested , " ride down to the Lady Luck and tell Tennison to send me two good men , will you ? Send them before daylight . I think we 'll have visitors . "  |p157Nobody  needed to tell Ruiz Beltran how to do the job to which he had been assigned . Nor did Velasco need any instruction . Beltran had been a hunter of jaguars and wolves for stockmen south of the border . When the government of his state offered a bounty for the scalps of Apaches he had done well , and who was to say whether the scalps on which he collected bounty were not all those of Apaches ? Velasco had been a bandit , a farmer , a vaquero , and , briefly , a soldier . To kill such a man as Sean Mulkerin was easy . He rode often into the mountains , occasionally to town . The mountainswould be better , for many a man went to the mountainswho did not return . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to see , and there was no chance of a mistake . Nobody else had such hair ... he had never seen such hair . Nor such a woman . They had found a seep on a small , out-of-the-way mesa near Saddle Peak , and there they camped among some boulders . The seep was a mere trickle , and apparentlyp158known to none but the few birds , and small animals for whom the water was sufficient . Enlarging the basin somewhatthey soon had enough water for what was needed . Secure from discovery , they could hide themselves and their horses while studying the land around them . From not far off there was a good position to observe the comings and goings of the ranch . On the day following their arrival , the fiesta ended with a stream of carretas and riders leaving . All did not depart at once , so they waited . They ate , slept , drank a little wine , and waited . " One thing at a time , you see ? " Beltran suggested . " One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the time will come . " " And when they come for his body ? " Velasco suggested . " Perhaps . I think maybe when first they take his body to the ranch . She will come out . She with the red hair . How can one make a mistake ? But we will shoot ... both of us . " " And then ? " " We will arrange a meeting with Senor Wooston . We will tell him to bring the money . " " And if he does not ? " " We will kill him . I think maybe we will kill him anyway , when he brings the money . I do not like Senor Wooston too much . . . and he will have more money . Besides , nobody will know what we did if he is killed , also . You see ? " The idea appealed to Velasco . He did not like Wooston , either , and the idea of killing him was appealing . How could you trust such a man ? In Topanga Canyon there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big woman . Tia Angelena was taller than most men and weighed , it was guessed , some two hundred and fifty pounds , only a few of them fat , and she administered her place of business with a firm and muscular hand . Yet she cared not in the least who they might be or where they came from.  |p159Tia  Angelena was a woman of no scruples to speak of but considerable loyalty , and one of these loyalties was to Eileen Mulkerin . Angelena had upon one occasion some years before been taken ill , and believing it to be cholera , which had appeared briefly in the area , both customers and her few neighbors fled . In that extremity Eileen Mulkerin came riding by , saw no smoke from the chimney and the door standing open . Sensing distress , the Senora dismounted and went in to find Angelena in a coma , the place a mess , the animals starving . Being a woman of anger and determination , Eileen Mulkerintook charge . Within a matter of minutes she had straightened the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not have cholera but was , nonetheless , very ill . For three days she stayed and administered to the sick woman until finally she was able to get up and care for herself . Tia Angelena was shocked and appalled that such a lady should have seen her in such a situation , and that she , of all people , would take it upon herself to nurse her back to health . Nothing much was said , but the two always spoke in passing , and Tia Angelena did not forget . Del Campo and Polanco had stopped by for a glass of wine , and Tia leaned her great forearms upon the bar and looked at them . She took the cigar from her teeth and said , " You work for the Malibu ? " " We do . " " It is between us , this . " " Si ? " " The Senora is my friend . " She sensed their doubt , recognized their politeness , and said , " No matter . . . when I was dying , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p160Del  Campo nodded . Who could forget such a thing ? And the Senora had cared for this one ? It was another good mark for her . " She is our friend also , " Del Campo said gently . " She is a woman , that one . " " Two men come here . " " Polanco shrugged . " It is possible . " " Two men . . . they come , they go . I think they hide in the chaparral . They come when no one is near . When someonecomes , they go . " " These men have names ? " She shrugged . " One is called Beltran . " " Ah ? " Del Campo scratched his jaw . " I know this one . You are right , Tia , he is a bad man , a very bad man . When he comes , someone dies . " He paused for a moment . " And the other one ? He is thin , hard ? With greasy eyes that slide but never look at one ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know them ? " Polanco asked . " From Chihuahua I know them , from Sonora I hear of them . I think it is very good you tell us , Tia . " " Why not ? If they are proper bandits they will come here to drink , to laugh , to dance , to play at cards , and then vanish when the soldados come . But these ? I think it is something they plan to do , you see ? Something for which they must not be seen . " I ask myself why this is so ? I think of the Senora and Wooston , and I wonder . " " Gracias , Tia . " " Del Campo drew on his gauntlets . " Finish your wine , Polanco . I think we will ride . " A cool breeze came in off the blue water , a breeze that stirred the leaves of the old sycamore , lingered among the stiffer leaves of the oaks . The breeze cooled the water in the ollas that hung from the porch beams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch.  |p161A  horse stamped in the corral , then blew dust from his nostrils . In the chaparral , a dove called . The two vaqueros rode into the ranchyard on lathered horses . They swung down and Del Campo went to the door . " Senora ? " She came from within the cool house , and they explained . She listened , then shook her head . " He is gone . He rode out this morning to find the body of the Old One , to bury it . He is miles away by now . " " We must follow , then . " Montero came from the corral . " Stay , " he said . " He wished to ride alone . He spoke to me of this . " He hesitated . " I think it is something between the Old One and him . " " But if they come ? " " There is the Senora . We must think of her . " Johnny Mims came up from the bunkhouse they had built from the poles and tules left from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " Mims took tobacco from his pocket and filled his pipe . " You boys stay here . Wo n't do no good to kill him ' less they get her , too . Me an ' my friends , we 'll sort of trail over to Auntie 's place and scout for some sign . If they been comin ' down , they been leavin ' signs . We 'll scatter around and find them . . . or wait for them . " " But if they follow him ? " Polanco protested . " They take their own chances , " Larkin Campbell said . " I rode with him a time or two . Ai n't nobody comin ' up on him . " Saddling up , the three rode down the trail . After all , avisit to a cantina was in order . And if those two showed up ? Johnny Mims had no doubts about that . If they showedup . Sean Mulkerin rode easy in the saddle . This route was not the one he had followed before . Riding rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to becomep162too familiar along the same trail . This time he crossed over the eastern flank of the Topatopa Mountains , watered his horse and made camp at Ten Sycamore Flat , and thought out his route . Riding alone toward a known destination was easier than scouting a doubtful trail for the first time . He let his horse graze , watered it again , and then went back into the rocks of Red Reef Canyon and holed up in a hollow with an overhang of rocks . If anybody was following him , he could see them first from there . Nothing in his life had given him confidence in his hold upon the future . All he had learned indicated that one lived by avoiding trouble , or if it could not be avoided , seeing it first . To a wandering man in the wilderness a back trail must be as important as that ahead , for it might be the direction to be taken tomorrow , and when one faced around the trail looked far , far different . Gigantic boulders seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . . . all things were different . Studying trails had taught him much about life , that much depends on the viewpoint . They had been followed before , so why not again ? A deer came to the water to drink , then another and another . Sean Mulkerin lay quiet and watched . He had meat enough , and no desire to kill or to fire a shot , and if somebody was coming they would he apt to hear it before he did , although he was a man who watched his horse . A mustang was like any other wild creature and alert to sounds and sights , as wary as a deer and even more difficult to approach . He slept , awakened , slept again . All was quiet . Only the rustling leaves of the sycamore , their mottled trunks ghostly in the night . At daybreak , after a brief scouting around , he moved out . He rode no trail , but scouted his own way through the brush , studying the terrain before him for obstacles that must be skirted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these must be skirted or a way found into andp163out of them . The sky was cloudless , so entering them disturbedhim not at all . What runoff there was came from the mountain right above him , so there could . be no surprises . Often distant rains would start flash floods down canyons that would suddenly appear out of nowhere in the desert , miles from there , with a hot sun overhead . The wilderness delighted in surprises . The sun was high in the sky when he topped out on the mesa above Beartrap Creek . From that vantage point he could look right into the open mouth of the great horseshoe of mountain that his mother had described . From this distance it resembled any other mountain , dry , pine-clad , and rocky . He studied it for sometime with the telescope brought from the Lady Luck , but it told him nothing . He walked his horse forward , and drawing up in the shade of some pines where the outline of his horse was lost in the shadows , he took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would camp down there tonight , somewhere between Beartrap and Reyes creeks and tomorrow morning he would go into the horseshoe , find the cave , and if the Old One still lay there , he would bury him . Sean put his hand to the butt of the Paterson . It was still there . And the Colt revolving rifle was also . He started his horse down a steep slide among the pines and within the hour had discovered what he wanted , a level place among the pines with a view into the hollow beyond . It was above Reyes Creek and in a small cove of about two acres . He watered his horse in the creek , then rode back up and picketed it on the grass . Building his fire under a tree where the rising smoke would be dissipated by the branches and leaves , he prepared a small meal of broiled beef , the last of his tortillas , and coffee . When he had eaten he put out his fire and moved back against the rock face where some trees offered shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of branches and bark from a dead tree . " Lost him , " Beltran swore in short , bitter words . " We clean lost him . " Velasco shrugged . " What of it ? He must go to the place of which Francisco spoke . There will be tracks . If he has taken another way , he still must come there . We will go there and wait . " " All right , " Beltran said grudgingly , " only I do n't see how he got away from us . " " He is a bad one , this , " Velasco said . " I think it is better we ride carefully . " Beltran had been thinking the same thing . Of course , they had taken too much for granted . They knew where the man was going , so they had ignored tracks until suddenly realizingthat there were none . Already they had been out longer than expected . Beltran was hoping Mulkerin carried enough grub . Then they would not have to go hungry on the way back . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , they scouted carefully around . No one had been there for days . Francisco had ridden away , and returned to see King-Pin go into the hollow . It must be that one they now looked at . " So ? " Beltran said . " What is it ? Just some other hills ? " " I heard something , " Velasco said suddenly . " It was when we drank wine at the cantina . I heard the woman speak of this Russell . He was a young man when he rode out , but an old , old man when they found him again . " " Bah ! It is foolishness ! Woman 's stories ! " " Perhaps . It is a thing to think of . " " Run out of water . . . thirst will do that to a man . " " Not as this one . He was truly old . . . in the space of one week , or less . I do not know how long . " " Forget it . "  |p165Beltran  did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . It was all nonsense , of course . With rifles in their hands they settled down to wait . It was just before nightfall when they moved into position , and Sean Mulkerin had just gone to sleep . His camp was above and behind them but not over six hundred yards away . Sean was awakened by the restlessness of his horse . His eyes opened , and he listened , watching the gray gelding he had ridden on this ride . Its head was up , ears pointed . Nostrils flaring , it looked off to the south . Sean got quietly to his feet . " What is it , boy ? What 's the trouble ? " The gelding twitched at the touch of his hand , then turned its nose toward him . He rubbed the nose affectionately . " Something down there that bothers you , is there ? Is it a cat ? " The gray tossed its head as if understanding but disputing the point . " All right , what do you say if we move out now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get much worrying this way . " Swiftly , he saddled up , gathered his few belongings , and stepped into the saddle . He rode off the mesa on an angle , descended into Reyes Creek and watered his horse . The horse had sunk its muzzle into the shallow stream when suddenly its head came up . " Steady , boy ! Steady ! " Sean whispered . Dimly , through the trees , he could see movement . A horse ! No . . . two horses . Fortunately , the bottom at that point was sandy so no hoof would click on stone . He walked his horse across and was up the bank and into the trees before he heard a horse whinny behind him ! He dropped quickly to the ground and held his own horse 's nose . " No , boy , no ! " he whispered . He waited , heard some vague muttering , and after ap166moment a man appeared from the trees where he had seen the horses . He could make him out only as an indistinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wore . Sean waited , his left hand holding the horse , his right on the pommel ready to mount . After a moment the man disappearedand Sean mounted and walked his horse up the narrow opening along the creek . All was quiet , only the rustle of water from the small creek , probably dry most of the year . He rode on , then came to a point where he had to walk . Dismounting , he tied his horse and went on up the hollow on foot . Suddenly , he saw on his left the flat place of which his mother had spoken . He walked out to it and stood there , waiting . Nothing happened . The moon was rising . Once he thought he heard a vague stirring around him , but he remained still . He could see the dark mouth of the cave . Suddenly a voice spoke . " You have come for gold ? " " No , " he replied quietly , " an Old One was left unburied here . He had no son to bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no need . " The voice sounded strangely hollow as though the person spoke down a well . " He has been cared for . " " Nevertheless , I must see for myself . " " Who are the two men beyond the portals ? " " I believe them to be enemies , but I have not seen them . " Sean paused . " No doubt they will be waiting when I go out . " " You are not afraid ? " " Of them ? No . " " Not them , but of this place ? " " No . " " You do not wish to come through ? "  |p167Sean  paused . " Through ? No , I am content with what is here . " " So be it . " There was no further sound , and no more of the voice . Sean waited , then went back to the rocks and sat down . He leaned his head back and looked at the stars . Was he afraid ? No . The Old One had taught him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of the mind , and if one did not offer it a place , it had none . He must have dozed , for the dawn was suddenly there , and he arose swiftly and went into the cave . There was no body . It was as Russell had said , the Old One was gone . On the shelf was the row of jars . . . four of them . His mother had said there were five . He looked into each one , and each one was empty . But one was gone . . . where ?  |p168Glancing  quickly around , Sean saw nothing of the missing jar , but it was of small matter . He was finished here . Sometimeit would be good to return and look around more carefully . It was obvious that work had been done here , very ancientwork , for the marks of chisels and picks were apparent . Sean walked outside . For a moment he stood looking around but there was nobody in sight . As a matter of fact , he had expected no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , for there were cracks in the rocks , tumbled boulders , clumps of brush and trees . He did not even wonder about the voice . Was that because of something the Old One had taught him ? Or was it simply that he respected the desire for privacy on the part of the Indians or whoever they were ? In any event , the Old One had been cared for and his body disposed of in a manner fitting to his nature . Sean stood for a moment on the terrace and said quietly , " Good-bye , then , " and walked away . He had no illusions . Whoever those men had been , the chances were they would be waiting outside the hollow.  |p169If  they were chance travelers they would be gone , but he had no such notion . That they were here , at this time , was too much of a coincidence . He went into the brush near the trail , paused to listen , heard nothing , and went on , as soundlessly as possible . To follow the trail itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had gone almost to where he had left his horse , he paused . This would be the first of the crucial spots . If they had found his horse they would be waiting for him to return to it , and if they had not they would be waiting outside the hollow . He listened , but heard no sound . Not even that of birds or insects . For some reason they avoided this place . He started on , then paused . He was now on the edge of a small clearing . Three paths pointing toward a place among the trees , a flat stone lay across two other stones , and the three paths met at this stone table . The altar ! This was the place of which Russell had spoken . He walked toward it , checking the ground as he went . He could see the boot tracks left by Russell , some of them smudged by the tracks of sandals . . . not moccasins , but sandals . The altar stone was smooth as if polished or worn from much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . The place was in no way distinguished except by the stone table and by the converging trails . Turning , he walked away . He was now within no more than fifteen or twenty yards of his horse . He found an opening in the brush , and touching not so much as a leaf , he sidled through , eased himself past a clump of manzanita . Sean Mulkerin could see the horse was dozing , quiet , unalarmed . Yet he waited , letting his eyes and his senses feel out the situation . He scanned the trees nearby . A bird was scratching at something in the dust , a squirrelp170was high on a branch opposite , busy on some activity of his own . All was quiet . Rifle in hand , he worked through the brush to his horse , gathered the reins but did not mount . Instead , he turned toward the opening of the hollow carrying his rifle in one hand , leading his horse . " Quiet now , boy , " he whispered . In his mind he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would point him right at their camp , and a good man with a rifle would have him dead to rights . He consideredwhat lay to right and left . Correctly , right was his way to go , but opposite the opening of the cul-de-sac there had been a dry water course on his left while the small stream took a sharp bend to the right before joining Reyes Creek . He walked on , hesitated , listening . Hearing nothing he went on again . Then he crossed over the trail and the trickle of water and went into the trees and boulders west of the trail . It was rough going , but he found a thread of deer trail and followed it . He glanced up at the walls . He was at the end , the toweringshoulders of the mountain reared up at the very opening , one close above him , the other a couple of hundred yards off . His eyes searched the place where their camp had been and he saw nothing . He looked carefully around , still nothing . He moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone or pebble . Suddenly the dry water course was there , on his left , and at the same moment , he saw them . They were fifty yards away , and spread out , watching the opening . As his eyes found them , Velasco 's head turned . The man was quick as a cat . As his eyes touched Sean 's , Velasco reacted . He spun and fired ! The bullet smashed into the rock at Sean 's feet and Sean 's gun lifted.  |p171He  fired , the Colt jumped in his hands and shifting his aim by a hair he fired again . The second bullet caught Velasco and the man stumbled , then went to the ground . Not dead . . . perhaps not even wounded badly , judging by the way he went down . The other man had disappeared like a shadow , and Sean moved , working his way back through the brush , leading his horse . He found a place in the dry water course where some slabs of rock offered shelter for his horse , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he got hit . If he was killed he did not want the horse left there to die . Crouching , he worked his way back through the brush and up through the trees , trying for a better position . Suddenly there was a sharp whsst in the air and a loop dropped over his shoulders . His eyes followed the rope as the roper jerked . It was Velasco , but the Colt rifle was still in Sean 's hands and he fired from waist level . The Mexican jerked on the riata but a second too late , for the heavy slug caught him in the chest . His great dark eyes wide , Velasco took a staggering step forward , then half-turned and fell , sprawling upon the rocks . Sean Mulkerin shook off the rope and crouched down beside a rock . The other man would have heard the shots . By now he would be wondering what had happened . Sean drew back slowly , keeping the body of Velasco in view , and he waited . The shadow of a rock indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bird was twittering in a tree , a squirrel scurried nearby , but there was no other sound . The dry water course in which he found himself was probably just runoff from the rocks , and not what he had suspected . It was probably dead-ended not far back . It was not the water course hep172had originally noted . That one was further along the mountain . He must be careful . Such a mistake could be fatal . He shifted hands on his rifle , drying his palms on his shirt front . It was getting very hot . He waited , liking his position less and less , yet fearing to move . So often in such a deadly game the first to move was the first to die . He turned his head , scanning the wall of the mountain . Sweat trickled into his eyes . He lifted a hand to mop his brow and a bullet spat rock fragments that stung his face . Sean dropped on his side and rolled , coming up on his knees . Another bullet struck just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the wash and ducked left into the trees . A gun blasted almost in his ears , and he saw a man crouched , thumbing a load into his rifle . They saw each other at the same instant and the man dropped his rifle and powder horn and grabbed for the pistol at his belt . Sean Mulkerin seized the moment . His Colt rifle came up waist high and he squeezed off his shot . Not twenty yards separated them and the chance of missing was slight , yet he took just that instant to make sure as the other man 's gun was clearing the holster . The Colt rifle leaped in his hands , and Beltran 's mouth dropped open in a wide 0 of surprise and shock . He took a step forward , his fingers spreading wide as he dropped his pistol . He fell , and as he fell , Sean fired again . The body jerked with the impact , and then lay still . Sean waited a minute , watching the body , and when there was no movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the dead man 's pockets . Several gold pieces and a small bit of torn paper , evidently carried for some time , on it the one word Wooston . Sean Mulkerin returned to his horse , and mounting up he rode back along the trail . It was a long ride home , butp173his horse was tough and in good shape and if he pushed it . . . Moonlight lay wide upon the Pacific when the trail he had taken led him down to the beach . Despite the presence of Mims and his friends , Sean was worried . Wooston was shrewd , a man whose cunning had no limits , and he was relentless in his pursuit of a goal . All was quiet . The surf rolled lightly upon the sand , and off shore he could see a light from the Lady Luck , reassuringin its peaceful look . His horse 's hoofs made almost no sound upon the wet sand , and the tracks he left would be gone by daybreak . Despite the calm of the night , he was uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not calm him . He turned off the beach and started up the road to the ranch . He was tired . He had ridden hard these last two days , and far into the night . The thought of his own bed awaiting him was all that kept him going , and the chance to see his mother and Mariana . He held his Colt rifle in his hands as he rode into the ranchyard . It was long after midnight and all was dark and quiet . That was as it should be , and talking could wait until daylight . He would justHe had started to swing down and he was moving when the bullets struck him . His leg was lifted to swing back over the saddle when the windows of his house seemed to rip apart with flame . He felt a heavy blow in the side , another on the skull . He felt himself falling , heard the thunder of the guns die away , and he was lying sprawled on the hard clay where he had played as a child . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild wave of fear swept through him . Was this how it felt to die ? Was he going to die ? Were they going to win after all ? He heard heavy steps crossing the yard , steps that stopped , then a heavy boot kicked him in the ribs , and then the same boot turned him over.  | " Is he dead ? " It sounded like the voice of Fernandez . " Are you crazy ? With seven of us shootin ' at him ? Look at him ! Blood all over and his skull ripped open ! " " Let 's get him out of the way before she comes . " That was Tomas . " Hell , let him lay ! When she sees him she 'll throw herself off her horse and run right to him . Just what we want . It 'll be nigh to daylight then and she 'll be right in our sights . " " She 's got friends , " Tomas warned . " So 've I. Better friends . Nick Bell said he 'd say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them ? " " Hell , Mulkerin 's here , ai n't he ? If they was alive , he would n't be , you can bet on that . I do n't know what happened , but he 's done them in . Let 's get out of sight . She might be early . " They walked back to the house . For the first time he felt pain . . . and sickness , a terrible , terrible sickness . He was bleeding . His skull was burst , they said . And maybe it was . He had to warn them . For some reason his mother , and perhaps Mariana , had left the ranch . For some reason Mims was not here , and if Montero was here he was dead or a prisoner . Prisoner ? Not likely . Not Wooston . If Montero was here , he was dead . What of Polanco and Del Campo ? He lay perfectly still , fighting off the weakness that envelopedhim . He dug his fingers into the clay . He must live ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned them . By some trick Wooston had got them all to leave and had occupied the ranch and now he was waiting . After the killingshe would simply leave the bodies , appear where he could be seen , and nothing could be proved . Captain Nick Bell would make sure that nothing could be proved . There might be mutterings , but Bell was thep175law . An appeal could only be made to Micheltorena and he would not interfere . Sean Mulkerin had been hit hard . He was hurt , and he must have appeared dying or dead or they would have shot him again . He dug his fingers into the earth and fought bitterly , desperately against the tides of pain . He must somehow be alive when his mother came home . His gun was in its holster . When he had been hit he had been dismounting and his rifle must have flown from his hands . The gelding had run off . Wooston and his men had gone back into the house . He struggled against the weakness . With his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty . He fought against a wave of nausea . Slowly , carefully he willed his right leg to move out from the line of his body , and slowly , it moved . That leg was not broken then . Bleeding , yes . He could feel wetness inside his pant leg . Slowly , he tried to move his left leg , nothing happened . He tried again . . . nothing . Six feet away on his right was the beginning of a wash cut by runoff water . If he could get into thatBut they would see he was gone and come at once . He lay still , fighting the sickness and trying to think . His head was throbbing with pain , his left leg was numb . On his right , along the edge of the wash , were some rocks , a dozen of them as large as his head , placed there in a row to mark the edge of the wash and where his mother had at one time planned a flower garden . Reaching out slowly with his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house they would be unlikely to see anything but the dark bulk of his body . He rolled the stone even with his head . Slowly , he edged his body to his right , then rolled that stone back and another in line with his head . After that he lay still , eyes closed , too weak to move . After a long time he fought another stone into place , andp176worked a little further toward the edge . He had now moved nearly two feet , and had the fourth stone in place , hoping they would mistake the stones for his body and not come to look . Why were they so sure his mother would return now ? Were they tricking her into coming back now ? What was happening ? Somewhere along the line , he passed out , and when he was conscious again he had a throb of pain in his head , another in his side , and a stiffness and agony in his left leg . He lay very still . Somehow he had rolled over on his back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . He lay very still , trying to breathe slowly and carefully , fighting by sheer will to get his mind to working . He had been out cold . Now he was aware again . But how long before his mother came ? How much time did he have ? He tried to move his left leg , but it felt heavy and awkward , the muscles refused to respond . Using his right hand he pushed himself up a little and managed to roll over . Now he was within inches of the wash . After a struggle , he got his hand on another stone and rolled it into line . Slowly then , he eased himself back into the wash and lowered his head to the sand . For a long time he lay there , knowing such weakness as he had never imagined , his head throbbing heavily with a dull , solid pounding . His side seemed wet , and when he touched himselfthere a spasm of pain went through him . He looked around for his rifle , but could make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague light in the ranch yard , light from the stars overhead . They should be coming soon , and he must be awake . He must be ready to warn them . He must be ready to shoot . Over and over he said it in his mind . He lay gasping slowly , heavily . He desperately wanted a drink , and the thought of the ollas hanging wider the porch was almostp177more than he could bear . There they were , gallons of cold , clear water . There was water at the trough near the corral , too , but that was far , far away , beyond the limit of what strength he had left . Suddenly his eyes were open and he was aware that he had been asleep without remembering even closing his eyes . He listened ... somebody in the house was talking . He could make out none of the words . He blinked his eyes . . . why , it was n't in the house ! It was there ! Right in front of him . His mother was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariana . Someone was talking . " He 's dead , and we killed him . " " Wooston suddenly stepped from under the overhang . " Look for yourself . He 's there ! " He stepped out another step and pointed at the rocks . Suddenly , as the skies had paled somewhat since he had gone inside , he seemed to see the rocks for the first time . Unbelieving Wooston took a step forward and Sean grabbed the bank and pulled himself erect . He grabbed a stick and using it for a staff , propped himself up . His gun was in his right hand . " Not yet , Wooston . I 'm not dead yet . " With an animallike cry , Wooston swung his gun up as Fernandez ran from the house . Sean shot , firing quickly but smoothly . . Wooston wore a white shirt and the target was perfect . Fernandez ran into the open and began firing rapidly . Bulletsdusted around Sean but suddenly somebody else was shooting and then another . Sean shot Fernandez and saw the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands up . The shooting was over , and all was still.
