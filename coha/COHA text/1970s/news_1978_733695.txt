txt China is conducting a vigorous diplomatic campaign designed to counter Soviet influence in the third world , cement overseas alliances , and lessen what it sees as the danger of encirclement by Soviet-aligned states on its borders . The campaign has inciuded these elements : 1 . A continuing effort to improve relations with the United States ? both to increase trade and technical assistance and to put added pressure on the Soviet Union . Since the May 20-22 visit to Peking by U.S. presidential security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , Americans in contact with Chinese representatives report a decidedly " upbeat mood " toward the U.S. As one sign of this growing closeness , Chinese newsmen visited the American nuclear carrier Enterprise June 13 while it was anchored in Hong Kong . The Enterprise and other American vessels are in the area in what many analysts see as a show of force against recent Soviet naval maneuvers directed against China in connection with its dispute with Vietnam . 2 . An intensified effort to counter growing Soviet influence in Africa . In a move paralleling Western concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern Zaire , Chinese Foreign Minister Huang flua recently completed a five-day visit to that country to sign foreign aid agreements . 3 . A continuing effort to block further Soviet inroads elsewhere . Mr. Huang is in Turkey . a NAT() member nation , for a four-day official visit expected to lead to the signing of an economic cooperation agreement . The Chinese mission is apparently designed to counter Soviet efforts to weaken NAT() by courting Turkey , which has expressed dissatisfaction with a continuing U.S. arms embargo imposed after the Cyprus invasion . *Please turn to Page 9 From page 1 China 's ' cold war ' keeps diplomats busy 4 . A stepped-up campaign to block Soviet sway in countries bordering China . Recent Chinese overtures toward improving relations with India , for example , are seen by analysts as an attempt to end the special relationship between that country and the Soviet Union under the rule of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . China 's propaganda campaign against Vietnam for persecuting overseas Chinese and accepting Soviet help in an effort to dominate Indo-China also is directed at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , Communist Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng 's visit to North Korea last month is seen as another effort to restrain Soviet-expansionism . Tension introduced In all of these moves the primary motive appears to be anti-Soviet . And that , according to some analysts , introduces a certain tension into Chinese policy . On the one hand , China projects itself as a third-world country resisting the efforts toward hegemony of both the Soviet Union and the U.S. In this respect , China seeks to identify with the aspirations of developing countries in Africa , Latin America , and Asia . On the other hand , this anti-Soviet policy has drawn the Chinese into increasing partnership with both the U.S. and NATO . In this sense , China is no longer a member of the nonaligned camp . Instead , it is moving toward the West in its efforts to conduct a " cold war " against the Soviet Union . The tension is especially evident in Africa , where the Chinese express support for liberation groups opposing white domination in Rhodesia and South Africa even as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in supporting the controversial Mobuto regime in Zaire , apparently on the principle that " an enemy of the Soviet Union is a friend of ours . " Arms stand modified At the same time , China has modified its posture toward disarmament negotiations through the actions of Huang Hua and others at the UN General Assembly meeting on disarmament . For the first time a Chinese delegation took part in the meeting , a fact that the Chinese media said displayed the country 's " new flexibility . . . since the downfall of the ' gang of four . ' " In some ways , this change brings China closer to the position of the U.S. , which supports arms-control negotiations . But the new position also expresses Chinese third-world aspirations by calling for a new disarmament negotiating body that would not be dominated by the two superpowers . The new body would replace the 31-nation Geneva disarmament committee , which is co-chaired by the U.S. and the Soviet Union .                   @ @
