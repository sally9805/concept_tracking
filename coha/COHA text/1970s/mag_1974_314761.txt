Class barriers are tumbling at the Bellamys ' . Lady Marjorie is hardly dead in the Titanic disaster , and ne'er-do-well Son James is planning to marry his father 's typist . Upstairs is distraught ; downstairs , aghast . Pale green eyes narrowing in her pretty vixen 's mask , head Houseparlormaid Rose Buck voices the general anxiety : " A stranger has been in my linen closet . I do n't know if I 'm still wanted here . " <P> Rose 's fear is enough to strike dread into the Bellamys , who know their patrician comfort depends on a skilled corps of servants . Eaton Place may be home to the Bellamys , but it belongs to their servants : Mr. Hudson , Mrs. Bridges , Footman Edward and , of course , Rose , whom Actress Jean Marsh has made into the most fetching cockney sparrow since George Bernard Shaw detached a rib called Eliza Doolittle . <P> Marsh is in fact responsible for some far-reaching social commotion . Upstairs , Downstairs , the show she created with Actress Eileen Atkins , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on PBS . It now has 50 million fans round the world . A Broadway musical is planned . CBS has bought the show 's U.S. rights , and plans to transpose the location to a 1920s Boston family 's Beacon Hill house with a black male " Mr. Bridges " at the range . <P> Bottoms Pinched . Not ' arf bad for a series dreamed up over a casual Sunday lunch during which Marsh and Atkins discovered they both had parents who had been " in service . " They were sick of seeing servants portrayed as scene transitions : " You know , ' here 's your hat , sir , ' or having their bottoms pinched . " Neither woman did anything to rectify the situation until a year later , when an actress boasted to Jean that she had landed a plum part . " I was furiously jealous , " says Jean , who immediately called a producer friend . " What do I do with an idea for a TV series ? " she asked . " You bring it to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series was based partly on the stories of Eileen 's parents , an underbutler and a needlewoman in the Edwardian era , and partly by Jean 's reading preferences . She wanted the servants to talk with the uncontaminated candor of Ivy Compton-Burnett 's oracular children . The close , conspiratorial relationship between Rose and Sarah , the rebel maid , was inspired by the two maids in Henry Green 's novel Loving ( belowstairs in a country house ) . Remembering how one of those maids found her mistress in bed with a lover , Jean says : " I always wanted to walk in on Lady Marjorie like that and scream : ' Ow , she 's in bed with the wrong man ! ' " That line never got spoken . Instead , Jean based much of the cockney dialogue on her mother 's pungent expressions . <P> Neither actress wanted a role within the Bellamy family . Eileen wanted to play Sarah to Jean 's Rose , but stage commitments got in the way . Jean admits to a little jealousy of the fame won by Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enigmatic quality was more successful in America . Says Jean : " She wants more but does n't know what .
