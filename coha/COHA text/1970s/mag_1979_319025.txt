Did a rumor planted by Hoover 's aides lead to her death ? <P> Her casket was covered with yellow roses , lilies and daisies . Among the 200 mourners at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris were her three ex-husbands . So ended last week the tragic story of Actress Jean Seberg , who was plucked out of obscurity as a 17-year-old Iowan to star in Otto Preminger 's 1957 movie Saint Joan , and who died at age 40 in the back seat of her car of an overdose of barbiturates . But even as she was buried , there unfolded in the U.S. an appalling account of how the FBI in 1970 tried to ruin her reputation with a planted rumor , setting in motion the series of emotional breakdowns that led to her suicide . <P> Seberg had angered the FBI 'S autocratic director , J. Edgar Hoover , by helping raise money for the Black Panthers . According to documents that had been obtained three years ago by Seberg 's lawyers and were released publicly last week by the FBI , an unnamed agent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was several months pregnant , be discredited with a rumor that her baby 's father was a Black Panther leader . Said the agent in a memo , which was dated April 27,1970 : " The possible publication of Seberg 's plight could cause her embarrassment and serve to cheapen her image with the general public .

Black Panther Party and should be neutralized . " Headquarters had only one caveat : " It would be better to wait approximately two additional months until Seberg 's pregnancy would be obvious to everyone . " <P> For unexplained reasons , the Los Angeles agent did not wait that long . On May 19 , 1970 , Los Angeles Times Columnist Joyce Haber reported that an unnamed international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " expecting . " She added : " Papa 's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther . " Other details in Haber 's column made it clear that she was referring to Seberg , who had moved to Paris in 1958 and become a star in French New Wave films such as Breathless after her amateurish performance in Saint Joan made her name a synonym for miscasting in the U.S. The report was picked up by Newsweek , a French publication , Minute , and American Weekly , a former Hearst newspaper supplement . Soon after reading the account , Seberg , who by then was seven months pregnant , went into labor and three days later gave birth to a dead baby , a white female .
