" Schmitt 's excitement was shared by scientists back on earth . Because the soil looked remarkably fresh and the crater resembled volcanic vents on earth , they speculated that volcanic activity might well have occurred on the moon as recently as 200,000 or 300,000 years ago . That would have upset the widely held view that the moon has been largely dormant for more than 3 billion years . Said NASA Geochemist Robin Brett : " If the material is indeed so young , we may have witnessed one of the important finds in Apollo geology . " <P> Last week the highly publicized orange soil produced some unexpected disappointment . Using " atomic clock " dating techniques . Dr. Oliver Schaeffer and his lunar-analysis team at the State University of New York at Stony Brook determined that the material was 3.71 billion years old , within the age range of other moon samples that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so far off the mark in their first estimates ? Conceding that it was all a " big surprise , " Schaeffer theorized that the long-buried soil might have been dug up recently by a meteoroid impact , thus giving it a fresh look .
