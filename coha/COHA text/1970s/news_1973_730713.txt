txt Farms in the Florida Everglades ? which produce for U.S. consumers immense quantities of winter vegetables ? are being threatened by a strange kind of erosion  --  the rich soil is literally disappearing into thin air ! More than an inch of topsoil oxidizes every year ? vanishing into the air as carbon dioxide and water vapor . On some farms , where the soil was eight or nine feet deep 50 yearn ago , now it is only three or four feet deep . And it 's still going down . The stakes in r this vanishing act are enormous . This highly productive land , covering 700,000 acres , produces $250 million in crops annually . Fifty thousand people work it , or-process its crops . Flat as a Dakota prairie , the Everglades fields yield sweet corn , carrots , beans , celery , radishes , leaf crops . It 's one of the few places in the country which produce sugarcane ? $75 million worth a year . Research under way Soil scientists at the Florida Agricultural Research and Education Center here say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of production . Once the organic muck-lands are gone , there is only hard limestone . This could happen , that is , unless researchers can find a way to halt or slow the biochemical erosion that is carrying away the soil with the air . That is where Dr. Robert G. Volk comes in . Here at the research center he is a sort of Lone Ranger , fighting a one-man battle against the elements to head off what seems inevitable . Dr. Volk , pausing recently among his test tubes , admits the outlook is not very bright . But he is considering a number of theories which he thinks hold at least a hint of promise . // *Everglatles soil vanishing // Soil losses like those in the Everglades have been detected in areas of organic soils for years , he notes . Here , though , the process is comparatively quick because of the high , year-'round heat . Extremely rich soil Everglades muckland s were formed over a period of 5,000 years from sawgrass and other vegetation which grew in profusion in south Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetation eventually decayed into a moist black- and-brown goo that was extremely rich in nutrients . Everglades soil can be considered an early stage of coal , Dr. Volk says . It is so rich that when dried , it makes a good fuel . When muckland is drained for farming , as it was early this century here south of Lake Okeechobee , it begins to oxidize . Acted upon by micro-organisms , the soil undergoes chemical attack that causes it to vaporize. iAbout 1.2 inches of soil a year , on an average , are lost . It occurs whether the soil is used for growing sugarcane , vegetables , grass sod , or just to build a house upon . The lake region is dotted with homes that look as though they were built on stilts . The fact is , most of them started at ground level . The earth , drained of its protective blanket of water , has simply vanished and left some houses as much as f0 it or six feet in the air . Four principal ideas Dr. Volk is working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add clays to the soil . The clays , he says , should reduce the output of carbon dioxide , thereby slowing soil loss . Aluminum-saturated clays could reduce losses even more , since the metal is somewhat toxic to microorganisms. 2 . Sterilize the soil . Using steam , micro- , waves , or some other process micro-1 organisms populations might be cut . 3 . Apply chemicals . These could act on the soil 's high nitrogen content ( the soils average about 3 percent niti  --  ogen ) and make the soil less attractive to micro-organisms. 4 . Apply treated wastes . Using massive ' amounts of treated sewage and garbage from the nearby Florida Gold Coast , the soil could be rebuilt . Frankly , though , the job is massive , involving an area only slightly smaller than Rhode Island . It may be impossible . As a short-range possibility , some scientists have suggested reflooding portions of the region and using them for aquatic crops such as catfish , crawfish , bullfrogs , minnows , and even water weeds for feed . Rice has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. R. V. Allison , who helped open the area to farming with his work on trace elements in the late 1920 's , says that if the soil loss problem is not solved , the entire area could simply become a conservation zone in another 30 years . Whatever the outcome , the financial prize is tremendous . The value of crops from the muckland is expected to soar to $1 billion a year by 1980 . Furthermore , the Everglades ' rich loam now acts as an important storehouse for water in south Florida , which faces massive water-supply problems in the next 10 years .
