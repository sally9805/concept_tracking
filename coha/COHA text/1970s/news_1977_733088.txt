txt " Bankruptcy for New York City is not a viable alternative , " says President Jimmy Carter . As President Carter knows , a healthy New York is vital to the United States . One reason for this is simple : New York is like a lot of other major cities battling decay and loss of jobs , and faced by the rising expectations of its unemployed minorities . In the Northeast , Boston and Philadelphia have similar problems ; in the Midwest , Chicago and St. Louis face comparable tasks ; and , in the West , Los Angeles has its share of urban problems . Thus , what happens in the battle to save New York from bankruptcy is ' important in the war against decay in other cities around the country . New York is also important as a symbol . Europeans , says Walter Hoadley , chief economist at Bank of America , think of New York when they think of America . Thus , when news reports tell of trouble in the " Big Apple , " Europeans believe the condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curtailed foreign investment in the entire nation with a resulting loss of jobs , plus a slowdown in tourism . New York 's difficulties are not even unique to this country . A recent issue of the Economist , reporting on conditions in London , said , " Any visitor can see that the fabric of the inner city is decaying ; whole areas are becoming depopulated , and practically the only signs of vitality hark back to medieval times . " // From page 1 : New Yorkers begin long , hard climb And New York 's problems are not new . In 1865 , the New York Times was lamenting the flight of skilled workers from the city to escape high rents , and editorials warned that making debt the order of the day would lead to dire consequences . - Even today , the city continues to draw warnings from editorialists . Said a recent edition of the New York Daily News , " To ensure New York 's long-term recovery and growth , the city must show that fiscal self-discipline has become a permanent way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little spare cash comes to hand . " The leaders sitting in City Hall finally have been spurred to action . They have mapped a two-pronged attack . First , the city must work on internal improvements . There is a growing realization that the city itself can not continue to be the employer of last resort ; that the city can not continue to see its budget balloon . Thus , professional managers have been brought in to run some aspects of the city . Donald D. Kummerfeld , formerly on Wall Street , directs the budget balancing . J. Henry Smith , former chairman of the board of the Equitable Life Assurance Company , runs the $4 billion per year Human Resources Administration ( which includes welfare ) . Kenneth Axelson , former chairman of J. C. Penney , helped the city devise a computer and accounting system competitive with those found in private business . Some 20 executives on loan from private industry are teaching municipal managers how to use modern techniques to run the city more efficiently . All of these improvements have begun to put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 the city will balance its budget , although it will have a deficit in fiscal year 1979 . The flight of businesses out of the city has slowed . At the same time , the city has begun working on ' a second front : that of attracting and keeping businesses . The city will work on marketing itself , like a lot of other cities now do . " Just being New York is not enough , " says Dennis Alee , who heads the effort . At the same time , the city has begun to re-duce taxes on businesses . It is offering tax in-centives to new or expanding businesses . All of these efforts will help , although as William Spencer , president of Citicorp warns , " The real need is for an evenhanded tax structure that is more competitive , overall , with other cities . " As chief executive officers like Mr. Spencer know , it is becoming increasingly difficult to get top businessmen to move to New York because of the state and city income taxes . Mobile Oil claims that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It ca n't get top people to come here . With such facts of life spelled out to it , the city has begun moving on its problems . In the next four issues , the Monitor ? will detail the city 's problems , the solutions as top leaders see them , and the strengths of the city .
