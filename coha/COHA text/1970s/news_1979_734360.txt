txt SCHOOL SUPT . Joseph P. Hannon said Tuesday that he will reveal a revised desegregation plan next week , but he emphasized that it will not include mandatory busing as suggested in a federal government " feasibility study . " He described the study , by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , as being " not feasible . " When asked about mandatory busing , he replied : " Would I recommend to the Board of Education that X number of children be taken on a ride of eight to nine miles simply for the sake of exchanging numbers and making statistics work ? The answer is no . " Hamm offered few other clues to the contents of his plan , but said it would stick to his concept of voluntary programs . He said the proposals would indude " speeding up the plans we 've already got " and some new programs that were projected to begin in 1980 and 1981 . DURING A NEWS conference , Hannon said the HEW study , suggesting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of integration , offered no educational improvements , would not aid the city 's stability , and would be costly . Hannon said that if the school board approves his revised plan , he will present it to federal officials . The federal " feasibility study " suggested extensive busing north of Madison Street and some busing on the Far South and Southwest sides , but left out scores of schools on the South Side , which It labeled as " Zone 7 , " on grounds that desegregation is not practical in that area . " I 'm aghast to think that in the Zone 7 recommendation they were leaving out approximately 35 per cent of the student enrollment of the city , " Hannon said . " One of the things we have done in our plan is to open up the system and not be exclusionary , " THE FIRST GOAL , Hannon said , is to calm the waters a bit , We must develop something that is going to continue to open up this school system for our children . " Classes ' begin Wednesday for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 475,000 pupils will be bused , some because they are handicapped and others for desegregation under voluntary programs . The total cost will be $30 million . " We 're not afraid of busing , " Hannon said . " We have more than 12,100 buses moving each day . " Hannon said that $15 million was // Forced busing not part of Hannon 's school plan // spent on desegregation programs last year , with more than 50 per cent going for busing costs . The Office for Civil Rights has threatened to refer the Chicago case to the U.S. Department of Justice for a possible desegregation suit if no agreement is reached , but Hannon said he wants to avoid litigation . " The courthouse is nowin , I think , for everybody , " he said . " The track record of court decisions in school desegregation rascal across the country have ended in deterioration rather than strength for a city . " EARLIER IN THE day , the city council 's Education Committee disussed the school desegregation picture and heard the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannon 's contract expires Sept. 13 , and the school board will vote next week on whether to retain him . Jackson charged that Hannon has not submitted a desegregation plan and has failed to comply with the law , a failure that has cost the schools $24 million in federal funds for desegregation . " How can we allow a $55,000 employe to jeopardize $24 million ? " he asked . Hannon 's actual salary is $56,000 a year . " It is much simplier to open the market and find six superintendents who will comply with the law . We need the law more than the superintendent . I 'd rather have S24 million than Joe . " Jackson said that Hannon has shown contempt for minority croups by refusing to meet with him . He emphasized that all segments of the community can , and should work together , under Hannon 's leadership , to jointly develop a desegregation plan to present to federal oricials . TRE EDUCATION Committee Invited Hannon to appear , but he refused . " It 's put up or shut up time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disband , " At his press conference , Hannon said he would not meet the Education Committee , because it might wind up as a " kangaroo court " against him . But he said he would meet with the entire 50-member city council . Jackson , in his Education Committee appearance , also criticized Mayor Byrne , who has said she opposes widescale busing and has voiced support for Hannon 's retention . Jackson said Mrs. Byrne " has barricaded herself behind the ' neighborhood school ' concept . " which , according to Jackson , " is being used as a code word to preserve the bastions of racial bigotry . " The racial composition of Chicago schools has changed , Jackson said , " but Chicago 's ' f wo n't ' spirit with regard to school desegregation has n't . " Hannon , when asked about Jackson 's remarks , said , " This gentleman that you referred to is at the current time the national resident expert on SALT , on what 's going on at Camp David , the Cabinet shakeup , oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . I could go on ad infinitum. "
