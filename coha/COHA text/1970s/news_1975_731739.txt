txt Nationalism and political opposition are stirring among the almost 4 million Soviet Armenians ? who up to now had seemed to be solidly pro-Russian and a strong bulwark of the Soviet Union . Strong indications of this development came last October with the news that several student members of a " United National Party of Armenia " had been tried in Yerevan and given hard jail sentences averaging seven years , with subsequent banishment . The trials , which were held in secret , were reported publicly by academician Andrei D. Sakharov " on the basis of completely reliable infor  --  mation . " One trial is still in progress . Earlier in June it was admitted that two older Armenians already had been sent to labor camp for " nationalist activities . " Arrests are said to continue . An Armenian underground manifesto denouncing Moscow 's " imperialist course " has reached the West . Similar strains have come to the fore In the religious field . Much like the Jews In their international associations and in their role In the arts and sciences , Armenians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for Moscow than nationalist movements among other peoples of the U.S.S.R. Trouble In Armenia is bound to have reverberations throughout the world . // *Armenia turns on Moscow // More than 1,500,000 Armenians live in the diaspora ? outside the Soviet Union . About 300,000 of these live in the United States . ( Soviet Armenia itself has about 2.6 million inhabitants ; more than a million Armenians are spread over the rest of the Soviet Union . ) Next to Jews , Armenians have the largest number of scientific workers among the non-Slav peoples of the Soviet Union , and proportionally the second largest number of doctors of sciences . Like the Jews , they prefer to live in metropolitan areas . Armenia always has had its share of political intrigues and jealousies , but these were small blemishes in a picture dominated by such figures as former Soviet President Mikoyan and Marshal Ivan K. Bagramnan , one of the Soviet Union 's most famous military leaders . Rescue from Turks'recalled Whatever Moscow 's shortcomings , Armenians have had reason in the past to he grateful to the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Armenians by the Turks in 1915 , the subsequent advance into Turkey of the Czar 's forces as protectors of the Christian faith , and finally , after severe fighting , the establishment in November , 1920 , of a supposedly sovereign Armenian Soviet Republic . What was more , almost from the start , the Soviets respected the Armenian church , one of the oldest of Christian churches . The ancient Echmiadzin , the residence of the Catholicos ( religious sovereign ) of all Armenians , is virtually extraterritorial . It has its own publishing house and communicates freely with Armenian religious bodies all over the world . In 1968 the Catholicos personally consecrated the big Armenian cathedral in New York . That there was trouble in Armenia first came into the open when Moscow last year announced the retirement " at his own wish " of the long-time first secretary of the Communist Party in Armenia , Anton Kochinyan , at the fairly early age of 61 . Mr. Kochinyan had been head of the Armenian Komsomol or Communist youth organization since 1937 , and was Premier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early last year , the first secretary of the Yerevan city party organization , Lyudvig P. Garibdzhanyan , denounced a growing anti-Russian mood . He warned against the revival of the social democratic ideas of the Dashnaks , who after the collapse of Czarism had been the most influential element in A ? enia . The Secretary called , for gratitude toward the " Great Russians " ? and announced that in 1978 a large obelisk in honor of the anniversary of the liberation of Armenia by the Russians was to be unveiled , with the inscription " for all times united with Russia and the Great Russian people . " Resentment caused by recent Russification trends seems to have been one of the causes of the trouble . Another cause was the fading away , with Mr. Mikoyan 's departure from the political scene , of what had once been a powerful Armenian lobby in the Kremlin . Economically , Soviet Armenia is more highly developed than some major European countries . Its physicists , astrophysicists , and mathematicians have won worldwide recognition . That against this background anti-Russian nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kremlin 's cultural policy .
