When Jane Benduzek , 40 , admitted embezzling $84,958 from Boston 's South Shore National Bank , where she was a teller , Judge Frank Murray was told that she had felt " entitled " to all that loot . She used much of it to help right such " wrongs ' " as the financial setbacks suffered by her brother , who has seven children , and her father , whose pension had evaporated when the milk company he worked for went bankrupt . Mrs. Benduzek also apparently felt entitled to a $6,000 boat , a $12,000 mobile home , a vacation trip to New Hampshire with neighborhood children-which she paid for with the depositors ' money-and to $2,000 in losses at the race track when she tried desperately to recoup . <P> The lady did not go to jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Boston hospital for six months . The bank gets the boat , the mobile home-and the problem of how to suppress feelings of entitlement among any other aggrieved employees .
