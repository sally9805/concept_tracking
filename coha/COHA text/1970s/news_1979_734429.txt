txt MAYOR BYRNE 'S administration settled its $270,000 parking meter lawsuit against Duncan Traffic Equipment Co. for $5,000 Friday . The administration had filed suit against Duncan last spring to recover 4210,000 paid to Duncan for inspecting the city 's parking meters during January , when most meters were buried in Tshnemadministration acted after aldermen and others assailed the payment as " a ripoff . " The payment to Duncan , a regular contributor to Democratic Party funds , was made under Mayor Byrne 's predecessor , Michael Bilandic , and at first it appeared that the new administration would pursue the matter with vigor , BUT IN RECENT months rumors circulated that the city wanted to drop the matter . Aid . Clifford Kelley 20th called the settlement " an obvious display of the citizens -be-damned-attitude " of the Byrne administration . He questioned whether the ** covers the city 's legal fees and said the settlement makes it imperative that a special city council committee investigating the meter inspection payment " get to the bottom of this and find out the real reasons for what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretrial discovery , which could have disclosed inside information on the politically well-connected Duncan firm , including its stockholders , financial payments , and present and past employes . THE SETTLEMENT . approved by Circuit Judge Nathan Cohen , specifies that the payment of $5,000 to the city by Duncan " does not constitute an admission , implication , or indication of liability . " Kelley said he would like to know : // $5,000 meter settlement // " Did Duncan maintain the meters or did n't they ? If they did , why are they paying $5,000 ? If they did n't , paying $5 , - 000 is n't nearly enough . " James Daley , an assistant city corporation counsel , said the $5,000 represents overpayments the city believes it could have proven in court . " Based on their records and ours , I would say they did make meter inspections during the period in question , " Daley said . However , the city 's records are based on information supplied by Duncan . CITY OFFICIALS told The Tribune last spring that the city did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid during the winter because city workers who normally spotcheck Duncan inspections were busy with snow removal chores . The city 's suit was filed after William Quinlan , the city 's corporation counsel , told a press conference , at Mrs. Byrne 's request , that the city would seek to recover the money in court . The suit demanded that Duncan either show how it inspected snowbound parking meters or return the $270,000 to the city and pay an unspecified amount of damages . TOE CITY 'S suit came after Kelley and a North Side resident , Demitri Konstantelos , filed their own suit to force the return of the $270,000 . The Kelley-Konstantelos suit was dismissed by Cohen last month on a technicality ; they sued before exhausting other methods of recovering the money , such as asking the city to take action . When the Kelley-Konstantelos suit was dismissed , Circuit Court insiders predicted that the city would settle its suit on terms favorable to Duncan . Last June , largely at Kelley 's instigation , the city council set up a committee to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson Frost 134th , a Byrne ally , has been virtually inactive since it was created . JEROME TORSIIEN. the committee lawyer , said his work was hindered when Quinlan refused to allow him to serve as a special assistant corporation counsel , a move that would have given him ready access to records of the city 's dealings with Duncan . Duncan , a firm at 69 W. Washington St. headed by Jerome J. Robinson , has held parking meter contracts here since the meters were installed in 1951.
