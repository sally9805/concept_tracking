THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment SL KYAB is falling , and NASA has ad-mitted publicly that it ca n't do a thing about it . When we read about this in the papers , we found the information a bit worrisome and also somewhat incomplete , so we called a friend of ours at NASA for explication . Our friend at NASA did not sound particularly perturbed . Perhaps , we thought , lie had been schooled not to be . Objects falling on you from space are to he thought of not as catastrophic but as just One of Those Things . The very first question we asked , having various plans for the future in mind , was " When is this going to happen ? " " There are too many variables involved for anyone to predict exactly when Skylab will fall , " he told us . Apparently , the NORAD people , who are in charge of tracking orbital and falling objects , can not point to the exact time and the exact place for the meeting with the terrestrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 17,500 miles per hour , an hour and a half per orbit . " I can give you an illustration , " our friend said . " They did n't do so well with Pegasus 1 this fall . That was supposed to come down in the Atlantic , west of Angola , hut it came down somewhere in the Angolan jungle  --  we think . We 've never found any of it . " We had not heard anything about Pegasus l 's fall , and we suspected that our friend was trying to reassure its by letting us know that things like this h , ' . - pen all the time . " Do things like this happen all the time ? " we asked . " Stuff is coming down almost every day , " he said , with what sounded like a sheepish laugh . Pegasus 1 , he told us , had been sent up in 1965 to determine the density of meteoroids in space . It came down in September , thus teaching a gaggle of Angolan baboons probably more than they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pegasus 1 weigh ? " we ventured . " About twenty thousand pounds , " he told us . " But most of that burned up and only about sixteen hundred pounds reached the surface . " " And Skylab 's weight ? " " Seventy-seven to seventy-nine tons , " he said . " We11 , how much of that is going to end up down here ? " " Umm ... maybe ten , maybe twenty thousand pounds , somewhere in there , " he said . " The track varies over a twenty-four-hour period , hut , if you 're interested in a general way , it lies between fifty degrees south latitude and fifty degrees north latitude and about seventy-five per cent over water . You can check it out on a globe . " We did . Tierra del Fuego , Northern Europe , and the greater part of Russia and Canada can breathe freely . " How did this happen ? " we asked . Our friend sighed , and began what sounded like a well-worn recital . " When we sent Skylab up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to stay up without any help from us until 1983 , " he said . " We thought we could predict sunspot activity well enough to make that supposition , but we were wrong . Sunspots have a definite effect on the extent of the earth 's outer atmosphere . They cause it to expand , and the expansion of the atmosphere slows orbiting objects , and the orbits degrade . That 's part of Skylab 's problem . Its orbit would have degraded in any case , but unexpected heavy sunspot activity has speeded up the process , and so now we 're expecting an earlier descent than we had planned on . Next summer , probably . Actually , we had hoped the descent would never have to take place . We had planned on attaching small remotely controlled rockets to the outside of Skylab  --  an astronaut from our space shuttle could have done this  --  to boost it into a higher orbit , but now we wo n't he ready in time . " And the orbiting space laboratory occupied from time to time by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , that 's a different story , " said our friend . " They have controlled de-orbiting capability . " Fair is fair , and we felt relieved at the thought that most of Russia and , we hope , all of its prudent space scientists are outside the **26;5876;TOOLONG litter zone . One last question : " How long will it take for Skylab to hit once it starts to Fall ? " Maybe , we thought , there would be time to go down to the cellar . " Let 's see , " said our NASA friend . " I believe that would be around eight minutes . " ? ? Gala E uMoND O'BRIEN , ' 36 ; Lorne Greene .

" All this on a night when the Carters were feting Marian Anderson , Fred Astaire , George Balanchine , Richard Rodgers , and Arthur Rubinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has graduated only a thousand students in fifty years ! The Neighborhood Playhouse , which spawned the school , goes back to the Henry Street Settlement and the early years of the twentieth century : Lillian Wald and her staff thought that act-ing in and seeing plays would help release people 's emotions and the real psychological na-ture under the emotions , and that ethnic drama would make people proud of their heritage . The school , which came along in 1928 , was founded and fos-tered by three shining lights ? two Lewisolin sisters , Irene and Alice , and Rita Wallach Mar-genthau , who was all energy and intelligence and was shaped like a pair of parentheses  --  and they soon hired teachers like Martha Graham , Laura Elliot , Louis Horst , and Sanford Meis-ner . Meisner , who was born in Greenpoint , was a founding member of the Group Theatre of the thirties and is still remem-bered for his comic acting  --  for instance , a scene in an Odets play in which he tried to de-scnbe a hot silver fox he was holding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone booth while keeping his head turned looking for the cops . He wu had studied with Lee Strasberg way hack when Strasberg was running a theatre workshop at the Chrystie Street Settlement . In Meisner 's own courses , first-year students work on the building of their craft , and second-year students learn to use their craft  --  working on character and in The idea is always that you do n't have to reach fur the appropriate feelings in a part  --  they come as a result of doing everything else right . True behavior from moment to moment ? " beat to heat , " Meisner calls it  --  is what requires an actor 's attention . Deal with the little truths : Where am I ? What am I doing ? What is the other person doing ? What do I want ? Then the big truths will take care of themselves . " It 's impossible to teach acting , " Meisner told us when we sat down fur a chat with him near the dance floor at Macy 's . " But it 's not impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't give anybody anything he does n't have , but you can help him use what he has  --  discover what it is he has , accept himself , and be content with what he is . I hate ambitious people  --  they 're deadly on themselves . If anybody asked me what my philosophy is  --  well , I 've never formulated it , but I would say , ' Build a better mousetrap . Develop according to the dictates of your own nature , and then reveal that nature . ' And there 's a difference between revealing it and exhibiting it . An actress Like Dose revealed ; an actress like Sarah Bernhardt exhibited . There are those who say I train people for a theatre that does n't exist  --  but I tell the people I train , ' Training must he adjusted to what exists , because everyone has to earn a living , but never forget what might he .

Is Milton Berle , whom I like , any realer than I am ? We 're both alive , whereas some people only think they are . But do n't forget this : my students tend to dramatize when they talk about how good I am . " Office Workers OUR favorite highlights from " The Steelcase National Study of Office Environments : Do They Work ? , " the published report of a survey conducted by Louis Harris &; Associates , Inc. : Eighty-two per cent of the office workers in this country have positive feelings about their jobs . There is little difference whether the person is male or female , or has been on the job more than six years or less than six years , and little difference whatever the type of job or the job level . The three most important considerations that an office worker looks for in a job are clarity of the scope and responsibilities of the job ; interesting work ; and access to the tools , equipment , and materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past five years , seventy-three per cent of this country 's office workers have had a change in the location of personal work space . Ninety-four per cent of today 's office workers feel that the way their persona work spaces look is important . The two most important characteristics of a personal work space are how neat and well-organized it looks and the amount of privacy it affords . There is almost universal agreement on this among business executives and office workers . More than seventy per cent of today 's office workers are satisfied with their personal work spaces . Office workers on the average spend only 6.4 hours per day at or in their personal work spaces . THE Harris people interviewed one thousand and forty-seven office workers , two hundred and nine executives , and two hundred and twenty-five office designers . None of the office workers , executives , or office designers mentioned the importance of nice , clear , long corridors or of Coke machines , A nice , clear , long corridor is an important thing to have in an office because office workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's carry on an unsuspecting colleague . A Coke machine is important because an office worker can buy a nice , refreshing drink at it , stand around it and flirt , or sit on top of it stark naked while having a small nervous breakdown or while reading the poetry of Adrienne Barbean . The Concertina N the day after Christmas , we V- , heard a holiday story that in a flash emptied our mind of almost everything else . A man who has never hummed , who more especially has never hummed " Lady of Spain , " who would probably have always crossed the street to avoid anyone humming " Lady of Spain , " was humming " Lady of Spain " at an eggnog party . He unfolded this tale : I have always been careful about Christmas , planning its food and moods and weighing each gift , but this year I waited to see what would happen if I simply made up Christmas as I went along . I bought nothing , I sent out no cards , and then , one morning two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found two cards in my mailbox  --  one from a bookstore I owe twenty-one dollars to , and the other from a man I used to think I disliked , because he never prepared himself for a career and used to just take any job that came along . And I went back upstairs to talk to my wife , whom I had just kissed goodbye until the evening . My wife is a stockbroker , but she was n't going in to work that day , for some reason . " Hello , dear , " I said . " What would you like for Christmas ? " " That 's a funny question , coming from you , " she said . " I want a concertina . I 've wanted one ever since we watched that old movie on TV where Fred MacMurray was a bandleader who played the concertina and he fell in love with Carole Lombard on an ocean liner and she was pretending to be a princess so that she could go to Hollywood to break into pictures . Fred Macklurray is very good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's very relaxing to play a little music and noodle around , and anyway a concertina is small and portable , and it 's either hexagonal or octagonal , which are two pleasing shapes that do n't get used much , and it moves both in and out , and the notes come out through vibrating reeds , just like a person breathing and talking . You do n't have to get it for me if you do n't want to . " I was astonished . This revelation , like taking a wrong turn in a French town and coming upon a cathedral not mentioned in any guidebook , was unlike anything that had happened to me since I was twelve and my older brother told me as he set off for college that all his life , inside , he had been a Kodiak hear . Of course I would buy her a concertina . I had no idea where to buy a concertina . I called up a couple of musicians I know , and they both suggested pawnshops , but that sounded pathetic . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to abandon in a hurry . There was no listing under " Concertina " in the Yellow Pages . I called up a big musical-instrument store on Forty-eighth Street . " My wife wants a concertina for Christmas , " I said . " We do n't sell any kind of accordions , " said a businesslike voice . Of course . A concertina is an accordion . I looked up accordions in the Yellow Pages  --  they 're on the first page of the listings  --  and immediately saw two names in hold type : " ACCORD ION-O-RAMA " and the " Al AS ACCORDION CO . " Both were " Conveniently Located on Second Floor , " and they had the same address-874 Broadway  --  and the same phone number . I dialled . " Hello , " said a man 's cheerful voice . " My wife wants a concertina for Christmas , " I said . " Get a new wife , " said the voice . " Well , I ca n't , " I said . " Do you have any concertinasP " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . " " We have them . " The next day , I took my wife over to 874 Broadway , which is on the corner of Eighteenth Street . It 's an old manufacturing building in need of a cleaning , but it has polished-granite columns supporting capitals with lion heads outside the windows , and turrets topped with fleurs-de-lis , and a mosaic in the lobby says " MACINTYRE BUILDING . " " I 'd like to scrub this place up , " my wife said . " Would n't you ? It would he just beautiful . People keep talking about reusing old buildings , when what they should be doing is just using them in the first place . " We went on up to the second floor , where there are two shops the accordion place , and one that says " ACCURATE K. MILLS " on the door . This stands for " Accurate Knitting Mills , " I later found out . The owner of the voice on the phone turned out to be Gerald Shearer , a stocky man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big glasses . He was standing in a showroom filled with a hundred accordions  --  black ones and red ones for the most part , some in a glass-fronted showcase , others partly wrapped in brown paper and stuck up on high shelves . In the rnnm next door we could hear someone noodling on an accordion and tuning it . Shearer told us that he had been in the accordion business thirty years , and that he has such a diversified stock he can usually satisfy any customer  --  even someone who wants a concertina . He opened a metal cabinet , and there were half a dozen concertinas : small red hexagonal ones from East Germany , and a bigger , Italian hexagonal concertina with white buttons set into two brown wooden frames inlaid with silver mesh . My wife looked them over and played a few notes on each one . She obviously liked the Italian concertina . " Are you Italian ? " Shearer asked her . She said her family was half Italian , half German . " Ah , " said Shearer . " Mezzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian and the longest word in German ? " " No , " she said . " **26;5933;TOOLONG , ' " he said . " That means if you climb too high you fall suddenly and plummetingly to the exact same spot you started from . And Donaudamptschiff Artsgcs paschal tskrepaiin . ' That 's a captain on a boat of a Danube shipping company . " In a million years , I would never think of opening an accordion store . I have been a research chemist all my life  --  I mean , ever since I have been a chemist . Before that , I was wanting to he one , and preparing to be one , from the time I was three and found out my father was a research chemist . So while my wife tried the concertinas I talked to Shearer . " Can I ask you two questions ? " I said . " What is the Alas Accordion Company ? And how did you get into this business ? " " It 's an acronym , " he said . " Azienda Lavorazione Armoniche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also invented my own accordion , the Arpeggio Accordion , which uses the best of the features I 've liked in other accordions  --  fast keyboard , silent bass , special muting effects . I did n't lay plans to he in the business . I was horn in Austria , and then , when Hitler came in , I went to Italy , where I became a tap-dancer . That just sort of happened , by itself . Tap-dancing was a tremendous craze in Italy in the thirties , and the Mussolini government allowed fur- ? ? eigners to work in show business . The Italians loved Fred Astaire pictures , and all dance pictures , and I went to ' Broadway Melody of 1936 ' and copied every move Eleanor Powell made . I was billed as an American dancer , the ' ballerino-mitragliatrice , ' which means ' machine-gun dancer , ' and then I joined a touring company , where I sat in the orchestra with a guitar , wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt  --  Buddy Ebsen used to wear a Mickey Mouse shirt when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out and say , ' The dancer did n't show up . What are we going to do ? Does n't anybody know how to dance ? ' And I would stand up and dance . Then the government said that only Aryans could work in show business , so I came to this country , where the theatrical agents had signs in their windows saying ' NO TAP-DANCERS WANTED . ' But then I got drafted , and the American Army , when I told them I had been a tap-dancer , trained me to work in the motor pool , and , when I said I could speak Italian and German , posted me to Hawaii . In Hawaii , I picked up a little Japanese , so when we got to Oldnawa I was made a Japanese interpreter , with a big desk , in some liberated ministry . The first day , a lieutenant brought in a Japanese man who was talking loudly and continuously . I thought I could pick out the word ' bicycle , ' so I said , ' Do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants us to find a bicycle someone 's stolen . ' Two hours later , all the lights in our camp went out  --  the man had been saying that someone had stolen the electric transformer on the roof . But I did n't stop , I kept the job , and after the war , back in the States , when I needed a job , I got into the accordion business because a friend of mine from the Italian stage , a silhouette dancer  --  his brother owned an accordion factory . I had to take accordion lessons when I started , I also fly my own plane . " My wife picked out the Italian concertina , and she can already play " Lady of Spain , " and I have no idea what is going to happen next . But New Year 's Eve is just around the corner , you know .
