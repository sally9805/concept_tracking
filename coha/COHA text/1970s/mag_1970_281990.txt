" There is nothing I would not give if I could promise you peace , " Israel 's Premier Golda Meir said in a message to her armed forces last week , " but I can not promise it . " With no end in sight to the prolonged Middle East crisis , Golda 's government offered the troops the next best thing . In advance of the country 's 22nd anniversary celebrations this week , the Defense Ministry unveiled three new and formidable Israeli-developed weapons systems : &gt; An almost totally redesigned version of the U.S.-built M48 Patton tank , which now mounts a British 105-mm. cannon , is driven by a diesel instead of a gasoline engine , and may be the equal of Egypt 's Soviet-supplied T-55s. &gt; A 90-mm. antitank gun , mounted on a halftrack chassis and capable of traversing from side to side , which considerably increases desert firepower . &gt; Most impressive of all , the ship-based Gabriel missile , a flat-trajectory supersonic weapon against which no defense is reported to have been built as yet . <P> The Gabriels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 knots ) French-built missile boats , the last five of which were smuggled out of Cherbourg in December in defiance of France 's arms embargo . Each Sa'ar ( Hebrew for storm ) carries eight Gabriels . According to Pentagon specialists , the missile represents a technological breakthrough and greatly outperforms the Soviet Styx system , which the Egyptian navy used to sink the Israeli destroyer Elath in 1967 . Its guidance is self-contained , combining both infra-red ( heat-seeking ) and radar-homing techniques . The Gabriel hunts down its target at such low levels that it becomes coated with sea spray on long flights . Washington is particularly interested in the fact that the new missile seems to be eminently capable of delivering a nuclear warhead . <P> Commando Raids . The new arms promised to be of benefit in any renewal of all-out fighting . Last week , however , Israel was concerned with smaller-scale attacks by Arab commandos .

Three other major Arab thrusts came from southern Lebanon . Rockets killed a father and daughter in the east Galilee town of Kiryat Shemona ; three Israeli soldiers died in an ambush on the foothills of Mount Hermon , and Israeli police near Haifa trapped a Fatah band , claiming four kills while suffering three wounded . In the wake of those attacks , Defense Minister Moshe Dayan warned : " Israel must take action across the border . " Late in the week , Israeli jets struck at fedayeen-controlled areas in south Lebanon .
