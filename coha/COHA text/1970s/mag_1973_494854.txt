It seems to most of us , unless we 've been in Detroit too long , that you ca n't discourage the use of gasoline and sell big , powerful cars at the same time . Yet that 's the inconsistency embraced by American car makers . The big three sold Cadillacs , Lincolns and Chryslers for years on the odd premise that anyone should want and be able to buy the fattest , heaviest , plushiest private transportation in the world . To this must now be added the thought that every driver is entitled to burn gas at the rate of 10 ( Cadillac ) , eight ( Lincoln , Chrysler ) or seven ( Oldsmobile Toronado ) miles per gallon as he travels in one of these great whales . The car Manufacturers in no other country are so foolish . Why are ours ? Perhaps , even in the middle of an oil shortage , they are trying to preserve the American Way . Or perhaps the big three want to continue selling more cars because they 're more profitable , in which case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no news that Detroit views the Clean Air Act as an enemy in this time of crisis . Ford and Chrysler are flying the flag of the fuel shortage as an advertisement for delaying auto emission standards slated to go into effect in 1975 . General Motors has done the same for 1976 standards ( the standards have been put off for a year already ) . Ford and Chrysler say that the new catalytic converters due in 1975 waste gasoline and are n't worth installing . And all three auto giants assert that the cost of adapting to the new device will raise the " sticker price " of cars about $150 , a terrible penalty for consumers ? and the industry . The automakers ' own data , however , show that the alarm over loss of fuel economy in 1975 is nonsense . General Motors has announced that because of changes being made to adapt to the catalysts , its 1975 cars will get , on the average , 13 percent better mile ? age than 1974 models . Ford and Chrysler say the catalysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Chrysler expert has made the self-serving point that GM 's fuel savings estimate had been low ' ered twice already , and that GM " admits " that only 10 percent of the the saving will be achieved by mechanical changes . The rest of the saving , the shameful truth reveals , will be achieved by making smaller cars . Environmental Protection Agency statistics make the same point : smaller cars improve their mileage considerably under 1975 regulations , while heavy cars do worse . Thus there is no advantage in freezing standards where they are today . Savings can be had only by going forward to-1975 or backward to 1970 . As for the price increase , that is precisely what the gas shortage requires . Rationing gasoline is cum ? bersome , though it may be necessary . But why not raise the price of engines that pollute ; especially big engines , if the object is to discourage driving ? Clarence Ditlow , a staffer on Ralph Nader 's Public Interest Research Group , checked some industry claims against an EPA report and came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars with air conditioners burn nine to 20 percent more gas than those without air conditioners . Ditlow says that an " air conditioner moratorium " begun with 1975 models would save 380 to 656 million gallons of gas the first year . Ditlow then compares the industry claim that 2.7 billion gallons of gas could be saved annually by re ? moving anti-pollution devices from all cars with his own estimate that 3.9 billion gallons could be saved by removing all car air conditioners . Which is more urgent , the need for clean air inside the car or outside it ? If Detroit were firmly committed to saving fuel and lowering prices as it says it is , would it not eagerly remove not just emission controls and air conditioners , but vinyl roofs , power steering , power windows and sunroofs , automatic transmissions and bias-ply tires ? All these changes would save gasoline , but they do n't interest the car makers . The industry is only one example , but probably the best , of how businesses have learned to ? shrink re ? sponsibility by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying in the pollution controversy , because the government stepped in only after private enterprise had botched the job . The energy shortage is the newest industry excuse for seeking governmental relief and , more dangerously , for un ? doing environmental laws passed in Nixon 's first term . The President has tried to reassure the country that the shortage will not require hard sacrifice . He has delayed taking the first steps toward gas rationing , given special attention to truck drivers ' complaints and ordered special relief for private airplane builders and owners . He told the seafarers union that the crisis would be over in a year and informed another audi ? ence that " no one will suffer " for lack of fuel . Picking up that cue , Washington ? lobbyists have begun plying the government with fresh arguments and new fig ? ures to win concessions they have been denied before . Others try to squeeze larger allocations from the Fed ? eral Energy Office . The blossoming of the crisis lobby is having a harmful fallout , noticeable already in the interest-ridden House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed by the Senate , tiut once the Representatives warmed to the subject , they could not be restrained . One by one amendments were laid on the Senate measure during debate on December 13 and 14 , until the heavily over-loaded bill passed in the early hours of December 15 . It promised to delay 1975 auto emission standards for two years ; it suspended and thereby wrecked EPA city traffic control plans ; it gave kindly consideration to " late-night food stores " and moving companies ; it eliminated clean air standards applying to coal-fired electric generators ; it did away with funding school busing as a waste of gas . Many of these amendments replaced more damaging ones that would , for example , eliminate nearly all auto pollution standards until 1977 and exempt companies from the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act . Some of these came close to passing . When the bill went to conference last week , some of the wilder amendments were taken out . The conferees agreed to drop the ban on school busing , and they decided to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill still suspends for a year EPA 's authority to stop construction of parking lots . And although the worst features of the House bill did n't survive , their existence testifies to how casually Congress treats tough environmental statutes . The real strength of the EPA is in the law that created it , rather than its staff , and this is why EPA has been able to stand up to the White House on so many occasions . The President is more worried about the GNP than air quality , and he has already asked ( and received ) congressional permission to let oil com ? panies violate one environmental law in order to build a pipeline in Alaska . He has also taken away what EPA considered to be its authority to set and enforce safe radiation levels . He has transferred this power to the more industry oriented Atomic Energy Commission . Urging the hurried building of more refineries , deep-water tanker ports and offshore oil wells , he has asked for power to override the EPA 's judgment in deciding . which furnaces may burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let stand ? ards decline . The EPA and even the environmental lobby groups have conceded that one compromise of standards may be necessary . Because the Arab embargo caught us short of low-sulfur oil , there is no alternative this winter but to allow some power plants and perhaps some factories to use substandard fuel . That is why the EPA has permitted five states to tolerate " variances , " but in each case it has made close reviews to ascertain that there really are no better possibilities . In New York , for example , the EPA permitted Con Edison to burn dirty fuel in one plant but not in another . EPA figures showed that there would be one or two more deaths on bad days in New York if pollution was allowed to increase ; on the other hand keeping build ? ings cold would push the death rate higher . The plant in the less congested area was allowed to violate air standards . This is the sort of assessment that should precede any relaxation of environmental laws , and the EPA is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed objectivity . Last April Henry Kissinger said 1973 was to be " the year of Europe , " and this December , on his way to the Middle East , the secretary of State stopped in Brussels to tell the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization what he had in mind . A heated exchange reportedly ensued , for sharp differences remain be ? tween what Kissinger in April called the " regional interests " of Europe and the " global interests " of the United States ? the former , by inference , not so impor ? tant as the latter . Two days later , in London , Kissinger backed away from that distinction : " We have no in ? tention of restricting Europe 's international role to regional matters . " He admitted , however , to " uneasi ? ness about some of the recent practices of the European community in the political field " ( a thinly veiled refer ? ence to Europe 's pro-Arab bias ) , and he warned there is " a real danger of a gradual erosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace to its nations and brought prosperity to its peoples . " The Atlantic alliance , he said , must choose between " crea ? tivity together or irrelevance apart . " The next morning he flew to Algiers . When American politicians speak of Europe " shar ? ing the defense burden , " they are usually referring to our balance of payments rather than the actual cost of deployment . The net US military balance of payments deficit worldwide was $3.6 billion in 1972 ? $1.3 billion of that in NATO Europe , mostly Germany . Bonn offset about $2 billion of the deficit for fiscal years 1972-3 through investments , credit and procurement of Amer ? ican weapons . Nonetheless the gap between US out ? lays in NATO and European offset payments for fiscal year 1974 is expected to run between $600 million and $1.4 billion . Although the projected gap is in line with that of recent years , an amendment to the military authorization bill has markedly changed the situation . Authored by Senators Henry Jackson ( D , Wash. ) and Sam Nunn ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States will withdraw a percentage of its 300,000 NATO troops equal to the percentage of the balance of payments deficit not offset by our European allies . If the gap is in the predicted range of $600 million to $1.4 billion , the withdrawals would be substantial : 24 to 56 percent of our European garrison . ( The amendment has loopholes : the fiscal 1974 gap need not be made up until mid-1975 , the means of calculating the deficit are left vague and , of course , the measure could always be repealed in another session of Congress . ) Although the Jackson-Nunn amendment makes no sense . from a security standpoint ? forces which are militarily necessary ought to be maintained , those which are not should be withdrawn ? it has given the Nixon administration a potent political weapon . It can maintain its ritual opposition to unilateral troop with ? drawals , and at the same time threaten such with ? drawals if Europe does n't offer up more . " Can a proposal for a reduftion of forces in Europe be developed which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union , or will any proposal which the Soviets might find accept ? able be unacceptable to NATO ? " This , a recent staff report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee points out , is the crucial question . The United States - first sought a common NATO position . Following two US notes on the subject , a NATO guidelines paper " was agreed to in mid-October setting forth the sub ? stantive and procedural approach to the negotiations as agreed among the allies . " However mutual bal ? anced force reduction is still quite suspect in European capitals . The British , notes the Senate report , remain " strongly opposed to the MBFR negotiations , " and the French have characterized the talks " as yet another indication of a lessened US interest in the security of Europe . " Only one European official of the many in ? terviewed thought the Soviet Union " would actively seek to reach an MBFR agreement . " Moreover there was considerable concern among Europeans that " the United States is prepared to deal over their heads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between MBFR and burden sharing is complex , and it is made more so by present nuclear arrangements . European security ultimately rests on the American willingness to risk general nuclear war . But the 7000 tactical nuclear weapons in Europe would essentially be directed against targets within central Europe , and our NATO allies are understandably skep ? tical of any strategy that would turn Europe into a nu ? clear battlefield but spare the United States and Soviet Union . The Germans , for instance , have refused to permit holes to be dug for nuclear demolition mines that would be detonated to block Soviet invasion routes . Although such mines are wholly defensive and would be emplaced only if invasion were imminent , the US has been forbidden permission even to dig the holes ! While the Germans realize that tactical nuclear weapons can lend credibility to NATO 's conventional forces , " the thought that tactical nuclear weapons might actually be used in central Europe is far more difficult for them to accept , " says the Senate report . NATO has often been called " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1940s has given way to a multipolar world . An ironic indication of that change is China 's quite vocal support of NATO . Al ? though NATO remains the guardian of Western capi ? talism , it serves Chinese interests by tying down forces on the Soviet western flank that might otherwise be deployed against China 's long northern border . Be ? cause NATO gives the US control of Europe 's defense , it works against greater European integration and in ? dependence . In the absence of NATO the united wealth and technology of . Western Europe could quickly make it the world 's third nuclear superpower . Such a development would not be in the Soviet inter est ; so NATO preserves a status quo satisfactory to the Soviets . If our allies find our European policy puzzling , they are not entirely to blame . On one hand , for example , the Nixon administration argues that American forces are in Europe to protect American security interests ; on the other it demands Europeans pay a greater share of the cost for their defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MBFR ) on conventional and nuclear forces in Europe but pointedly exclude them from the bilateral strategic , forces : the cornerstone of deterrence in Europe . ' In the years immediately following World War II , the security interests of the United States and Western Europe were identical , but with diminishing Soyiet pressure they have diverged . The differences can not be papered over by a " new Atlantic charter " : they are real ( e.g. , the Middle East ) . Before the United Stateg can deal sensibly with the unavoidable complexities of European issues , it must first identify American.inter ? ests and adjust its policies accordingly . What , for in ? stance , are the purposes of US NATO forces ? What should be their size and composition ? Instead of ad ? dressing such questions , State and Defense simply ask Congress to authorize the same number of European troops year after year . Whenever there are signs Con ? congress might take seriously its constitutional authority to " raise and support armies , " generals , cabinet offi ? cers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take away the Pres ? ident 's " bargaining chips . " That is not a policy ; it is temporizing . Back in 1961 , when friends of Secretary of the Navy John Connally were talking him up for governor of Texas the next year , Connally wondered aloud where he 'd get his first contribution . He got a quick answer . A young Houston businessman and ex-congressman , Lloyd M. Bentsen , Jr. ; promptly obliged . They 're still friends and their paths cross socially , but Texas political ? cal circles are titillated by the prospect of a showdown between them in 1976 if both seek the presidency . It 's a confrontation that would crack the celebrated political ? cal homogeneity of the Texas corporate world . Bentsen , now a US senator , flares a bit if questioned too hard on Connally . " I do n't want to get into that . Every time I do , it comes out wrong . Just say we 're friends but I 'm a Democrat and he 's a Republican . " What 's puzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who returned to Wash ? ington less than three years ago as the " bad guy " whoknocked off ex-Sen . Ralph Yarborough in a nasty pri ? mary is thought of as a presidential candidate . There are several ways to explain it . First , Bentsen is a Texan , and Texas has a big bag of electoral votes . He 's also a self-made millionaire several times over and a man with whom the business community feels comfortable . The similarity to Connally ends there . Bentsen is trying to build a coalition of organized labor , minorities and liberals ( what Texans call " brass collar " Democrats ) , courthouse officials and business ? men . He is as self-assured as Connally but in a quieter , more analytical way . He 's not as manipulative , and where Connally made a point of putting down such Yarborough allies as Houston 's Billie Carr , Bentsen is on talking terms with them . Such Yarboroughites as Carr and Bernard Rapaport , the Waco insurance man who has financed many a liberal campaign in Texas , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early welcome in Washington from Ma ? jority Leader Mansfield , who has made it a point to extend a helping hand to " a new generation from the South . " Florida 's Lawton Chiles , Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and ex-Sen . William Spong of Virginia also were courted on arrival , and Mansfield has men ? tioned Bentsen , along with Gov . Reuben Askew of Florida , as a potential presidential nominee in 1976 . Bentsen sees himself as a pragmatist with a healthy concern for the taxpayers ' burdens . He ' considered the supersonic transport " a piece of technological ele ? gance this country could n't afford , " and even if it could he did n't think it should be charged to the tax ? payers . He does n't buy every gadget the Pentagon wants . As subcommittee chairman he bucked Chair ? man John Stennis of Senate Armed Services on accel ? erated development of the Trident submarine because it struck him as poorly managed and a waste of money ( perhaps $500 million ) . He lost by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and nearly won . When a Texas site was picked for the Pentagon 's " Sanguine " communications project he was not impressed : " In that kind of situation , I thought trying to put it in an area where it would be environmentally destructive to the property rights of a lot of people was wrong . " He 's not against the project as such , however . He was an early sponsor of a war powers bill and supported a series of Mansfield " end-the-War " amendments . So he 's not exactly " hawkish . " If Bentsen is to build a broad base of national sup ? port , he knows he 'll have to turn to bread and butter issues . " If we 'd stuck with these issues in 1972 , we could have won , " he says .
