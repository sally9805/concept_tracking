As the mists of a decade of White House conspiracy are rolled back , there is a better view of Lyndon Johnson . The new trails of CIA and FBI domestic spying , however uncertain as yet , lead back to his Oval Office and that towering figure of contradictions . Those ravaged patrons of Richard Nixon are quick to suggest that L.B.J. was as bad as or worse than the disgraced 37th President . But that has not yet been proved . <P> What seems more likely is that there was an unusual combination of people and events in the mid-1960s . There was J. Edgar Hoover , the aging head of the FBI , who kept in his private safe the hottest files on important people and dribbled the information out to Presidents when it served his power-hungry purpose . Hoover knew his man ; Johnson had a voracious appetite for gossip . Then there was Cartha ( Deke ) Deloach , Hoover 's deputy , who felt that he might be named Hoover 's replacement under Johnson . Deloach became a courier to the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there was Johnson , schooled in the tangles of Texas politics , tutored by Master Plotter Franklin Roosevelt , tempered in the Senate 's school of the deal , and ultimately a man who believed that there were no accidents in politics , only conspiracies . He armored himself with intimate knowledge of those he believed conspired against him , which was almost everybody . " I do n't trust anybody but Lady Bird , " he once said , " and sometimes I 'm not sure about her . " <P> He never accepted the findings of the Warren Commission and believed always that John Kennedy 's assassination was a conspiracy by Communists in retaliation for a reported effort by Kennedy to have Fidel Castro killed . He believed that the race riots in the ghettos and the peace marches in the streets were being paid for by the Red Chinese . " I know there is Chinese Communist money there , " he kept telling his aides . <P> L.B.J. was convinced that Bobby Kennedy had bugged him all during the time that he was Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he believed that the CIA had gone ahead and killed South Vietnam 's President Ngo Dinh Diem against Kennedy 's wishes . He had a further notion that the CIA was somehow linked with the Mafia . <P> He read and reported with relish the findings of the Treasury in the biggest tax cases . He bragged once that he knew within minutes what Senator William Fulbright , then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , had said at lunch at the Soviet embassy or what Soviet contacts had told other members of Congress at cocktail parties . He insisted that the Soviets were building Viet Nam opposition in Congress and the press . He slapped his thigh with delight when he got a report from the FBI about a prominent Republican Senator who frequented a select Chicago bordello and had some kinky sexual preferences , all of which were reported in detail . The information came from a madam who was an FBI informer .
