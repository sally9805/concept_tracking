 | Before You Buy a ' 72 Car ... So you want to buy a new car ? Great ! But what kind of car ? What make and model ? To select the right car , you 've got to anticipate the kind of driving you 'll do . You 'll have to decide , too , how much money you want to put into your new car . Family cars are available from a $2,050 four-seater Pinto to a $7,750 six-seater Cadillac . Sports/specialty cars range from a $2,800 Barracuda to an $8,850 Continental Mark IV . And station wagons cover a spread from the little $2,500 Vega to the $5,200 Chrysler Town &; Country . ( Prices are estimates and include federal excise tax and dealer preparation charge but not transportation costs , state and local taxes , or optional equipment . ) What 's in a line ? You have a choice of 299 models in 47 different car lines . What is a car line ? Well , the standard-size Chevrolet is a line , as is the Chevelle . But Impala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolet line . Each series offers a choice of body t two-door sedan , four-door sedan , convertible , and station wagon , for instance ) . The series come in different price classes , and some have more body types than others . The Biscayne and Bel Air are lower-priced , and can only be had as four-door sedans . The Impala has a full range , including hardtops and a convertible . Biscayne and Bel Air are sold mainly as fleet cars ; the Impala is aimed at the private buyer . The charts on the next page show you analogous lineups for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp . If you intend to keep your car for a long time , you can save money by getting a low series . But if you trade after a year or two , you 'll lose , because the high series have higher resale values . You 'll find the same setup , with low and high series , in intermediate and compact car lines , too . And within each series , there are a number of models ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevy comes in nine different passenger-car models , plus four wagon models . Ford offers 19 Ford models in the Custom , Galaxie , and LTD series . Plymouth has 15 models in the Fury series . Plymouth has some name changes this year , too . The VIP has been replaced by the Gran Coupe and Gran Sedan . Your own needs usually dictate your choice of model or body type . If you do most of your driving alone or with just one or two passengers , you 'll probably be interested in a sports/specialty car . If you 're looking for an all-around family car , you 'll want a sedan ( or hardtop ) with two or four doors . If you need extra carrying capacity , chances are you 'll want a wagon . How big ? or how small ? should your car be ? Even if money is no object , maybe a compact should be your choice . Compacts are easier to drive in heavy traffic , easier to park , and can do most of the work of a larger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is a little different . You are probably replacing a car of a certain type , or adding one small car . In any case , you may find the charts on these pages helpful . They tell you what new cars are offered at each price level from all four domestic auto makers . If you have strong loyalty to one of them , scan that column until you find the line or series that interests you most . Car prices were very stable from 1955 to 1966 , but since then sharp increases have come with each model year and after each strike . The result is that you can no longer buy the same make and model for what you paid three years ago . But the list will tell what you can get for the same money , and whether you want to stay in the same stable or buy from a competitor . If you are replacing your 1968 Galaxie now , for instance , look at it this way : Your car was listed at $2,864 when new . A ' 72 Galaxie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Torino will have a basic price of about $2,800 , and its interior dimensions are just about @#  | the same as your ' 68 Ford . You 're not really " buying down , " for the intermediates have been upgraded , along with the standard-size cars . The situation is the same at GM , AM , and Chrysler . It applies throughout the full price range . If you are replacing a five-year-old Chrysler and are unwilling to get a Plymouth , Ford , or Chevrolet , look at all the other cars offered in the $3,750 to s4,150 bracket . There 's another advantage about looking for cars with a lower base price . You can afford more options ( air conditioning adds $350 to $500 ) . For instance , if you have set a total of $3,750 for your new car , you have a choice of getting a large car , practically " stripped " ; an intermediate with the most popular options ; or a compact with all the options you can think of . You 're walking a tightrope between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the power train and chassis equipment you want . You must set your priorities , weighing the pros and cons carefully . Our advice is to stay away from frills and concentrate on getting a better car . Most of you will probably come out in favor of the smaller car with the most essential options . How to pick your options . We made up a set of charts to help you . Variable-ratio power steering , power-assisted front disk brakes , a handling package ( often called heavy-duty suspension , special suspension , or sports suspension ) , wheelspin control , anti-locking brakes , and automatic level control are options that add real automotive value to your car and make it safer . Cost is quite modest in most cases . What 's more , some cars carry some of our recommended options as standard equipment , which justifies the higher base price . Automatic transmission is standard on more cars than ever before . That includes all full-size cars made by Pontiac , Mercury , Oldsmobile , Buick , Chrysler , Lincoln , and Cadillac . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optional on all others for an extra $165 to $225 . Chevrolet has phased out its semi-automatic Torque-Drive , and the two-speed Powerglide is available only on the Chevelle and Nova . Threespeed automatics are also offered for V8-powered Chevelle and Nova models , and the Vega now boasts a three-speed automatic for the first time . American Motors has changed suppliers of automatic transmissions , going from Borg-Warner to Chrysler . The unit is the same as that on Chrysler products , modified to give proper shift points for American Motors engines . Power options . All cars are available with larger or more powerful engines at extra cost . How advisable are higher-powered engines ? It depends on your type of driving . A heavily loaded station wagon will be safer with a bigger engine . A traveling salesman 's compact car has adequate power in its standard engine . We do not recommend six-cylinder engines for anything bigger than the Dodge Dart or Pontiac Ventura II . Heavier vehicles need V8 power . Sixes are no longer offered in the Buick and Oldsmobile intermediates ; V8 power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with standard six-cylinder engines , V8 cost will run from $90 to $124 . Muscle cars have disappeared from production , vie-Continued OCTOBER 1971 ' 87  | time of high insurance rates and increasingly severe emission standards . Pontiac GTO and Olds 4-4-2 are not series any more , but just options on Le Mans and Cutlass . Chrysler no longer offers the 426 Hemi . Ford 's 429-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 is the biggest power plant available for the LTD , Thunderbird , Torino , Montego. and Mercury . The most powerful Mustang and Cougar option is the HO version of the 351 Cleveland engine . Top power for the Comet and Maverick comes from the little 302 V8 . Regular fuel 's the rule . The Chrysler 440 with three two-barrel carburetors is available only on the Road Runner ( in the Satellite line ) and Charger . This is the only engine in the industry that still requires premium gasoline . All others can use regular or low-lead fuel . The 440 four-barrel is optional in the Charger and all Plymouth , Dodge , and Chrysler full-size cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 four-barrel . Nothing bigger than the four-barrel 340 is offered in the Barracuda , Challenger , Duster ( in the Valiant line ) , and Demon ( in the Dart line ) . Other Valiant and Dart models have the two-barrel 318 V8 as their top power option . American Motors makes its strong 401 four-barrel V8 available in the Javelin , Matador , and Ambassador . You can get a 360 in the Hornet and a 304 V8 in the Gremlin . Pinto and Vega are restricted to four-cylinder engines . Chevrolet offers its largest engine , the four-barrel 454 V5 in the Monte Carlo , Chevelle , and Chevrolet . Top power for the Camaro is the four-barrel staggered-valve 402 V8 , a smaller 350-cubic-inch version sets the power limit for the Nova . Pontiac will offer its own 350 for the Ventura II , and the Firebird can be ordered with a fourbarrel HO 455-cubic-inch V8 . This engine is also available in the Le Mans , Le Mans Sport , and Le Mans GTO . A four-barrel 455 is offered in all the full-size Pontiacs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high-performance engine W-30 and will install it in the Cutlass . The W-30 engine is a fourbarrel 455 with forced-air induction . Another version of the same engine ( L-74 ) is available in the Delta Royale . Buick builds a dual-exhaust four-barrel 455 that comes as the top performance option for the Riviera , Skylark GS , Le Sabre , and Centurion . More power ? one of the least expensive options . In the Ford Torino , which has a six-cylinder standard engine , a small 302 VS costs only $95 extra . A 351 will cost another X95 , and the 429 will be about $235 over the 302 V8 . But remember that extra power tends to drive the gas bills high . Do n't buy more power than you need . A special case for more power is trailer-towing . But do n't just get the biggest engine ? get the complete trailer package . All manufacturers offer various trailer packages for trailers of different weight , tailored for the car and bringing all systems ( power train , cooling system , brakes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't pull a trailer , but anticipate that your car will get severe service , it 's a good idea to order it equipped with the trailer package . Trailer-towing packages are inexpensive , ranging from $15 to $75 depending on the engine option used . Warranty and quality . The industry is back to **25;827;TOOLONG , but a real effort is being made to cut down on warranty repairs by improving quality . All companies are spending enormous sums on test equipment and inspection/rectification facilities . No one goes further than American Motors , however , with its new Buyer Protection Plan , which calls for certified predelivery service , including a road test , and free use of latemodel " loaner " cars for owners requiring overnight warranty repairs . The warranty certificate covers parts and labor . During the warranty period , owners will pay only for gasoline and oil ( and maintenance .
