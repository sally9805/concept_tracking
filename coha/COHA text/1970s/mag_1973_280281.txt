Just seven days after CBS announced that it would no longer practice " instant analysis " on presidential TV speeches ( TIME , June 18 ) , the new policy had its first competitive test last week . On NBC , John Chancellor gave a summary and some mild commentary on Richard Nixon 's address on the economy , as did Frank Reynolds and Tom Jarriel on ABC . The Public Broadcasting Service let Correspondent Robert MacNeil discuss the message with two experts . <P> All had advance access to Nixon 's text and to a White House background briefing by Treasury Secretary Charles Shultz , who put the price freeze in perspective by comparing it to " shock treatment . " Those who watched the President on CBS were spared such explication . The network went straight back to Sonny and Cher . Instant analysis annoys the White House when correspondents challenge presidential dicta . In this case , however , CBS simply ignored the Administration 's own background information-a service to neither the President nor the public .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
