Within the next decade , food production from the seas should quadruple . By 1980 , deep wells in the seabeds may supply more than a third of the world 's oil . Some day the oceans will provide most of man 's metals . Yet all this raises troubling questions : How can the coming rush to grab the watery wealth be controlled ? To whom do the oceans ' riches legally belong ? Most important , can the seas be developed peacefully ? <P> Seeking answers to such problems , the Santa Barbara-based Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions recently sponsored an international conference in Malta . Appropriately named Pacem in Maribus ( Peace in the Oceans ) , it drew 250 delegates from 45 nations . As the conferees headed home last week , TIME Correspondent Wilton Wynn cabled his report : <P> Serenely set on a hilltop in the village of San Anton , the deluxe Corinthia Palace Hotel is four miles inland from the Mediterranean . Still , the scene within the hotel 's gleaming white walls was as diverse as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel lobby in bathing trunks just in time to change for the morning sessions . Thomas Mann 's erudite daughter , Elisabeth Mann Borgese , who originated the conference , chatted with Cameroon 's U.N . Minister Paul Bamela Engo , resplendent in red fez and flowing blue robe . Justice William O. Douglas , chairman of the conference , strode through the bar with his miniskirted blonde wife in tow . The place was jammed with students in opentoed sandals , bearded scientists , well-tailored businessmen , lawyers and politicians . A star of the meeting turned out to be Arvid Pardo , a sort of superdiplomat who serves as Malta 's delegate to the U.N . and the Maltese Ambassador to Washington and Moscow . Three years ago , Pardo introduced a U.N . resolution calling for an international authority to administer the oceans and ensure that the seabeds would be used for peaceful purposes . Result : appointment of a permanent U.N . Seabed Committee . <P> Buoyant Gesture . One of the main subjects of conversation was a similar proposal by President Nixon . On May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce all national claims to ocean resources below a depth of 200 meters ( 218.8 yards ) . This marine wealth , he said , should be treated as " the common heritage of mankind . " He proposed that individual nations be named by an international agency to act as trustees of the riches . Royalties from exploitation of the oceans ' resources should be paid to the international agency , which in turn could use the income for economic assistance to developing nations . <P> Though Nixon 's plan was a buoyant - and unprecedented-gesture by a major world power , it came in for surprisingly heavy criticism at the Malta conference . Third World delegates heard ominous colonial overtones in the term trusteeship . Britain 's Lord Ritchie-Calder wanted faster action tr keep the arms race out of the seabed . It is now so easy to detect land-based military sites , he said , that the big powers will soon look to the " opaque depths of the seas " for concealment .                @ @ @ @ @
