txt Moscow is turning its attention to Asia , now that Soviet party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev has his long-standing pet project of a European security conference behind him . Soviet policy aims in Asia , according to western diplomats , include the following ? all mainly directed against China and to Soviet advantage : ? In the Indian subcontinent , maintenance of the status quo with a gradual expansion of Indian influence in neighboring Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Afghanistan . ? In Indo-China , a strong unified Vietnam as a bulwark against Chinese expansion . ? For Asia as a whole , a grand collective security arrangement paralleling in some way what Mr. Brezhnev brought off for Europe in Helsinki . In his Helsinki speech , Mr. Brezhnev hinted that the European example could prove useful elsewhere . On Aug. 3 , the Soviet party newspaper , Pravda , specifically projected Helsinki as a model for Asia . Against this background , Pravda took up the question of India Aug. 4 , lashing out at China for allegedly trying to block the improvement of Indian-Pakistani relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Soviet Union has staunchly supported Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 's crackdown on her opponents and institution of a state of emergency ? as has the orthodox pro-Moscow Indian COmmunist Party . Pravda , in its Aug. 4 article , accused Indian Maoists of working with " right-wing reaction which unleashed a subversive campaign " against Mrs. Gandhi 's " policy of progressive transformation . " In Nepal and Bangladesh , Pravda said , the Chinese were " intimidating the public . .. with noisy allegations about Indian expansionism . " And in Bangladesh , the Chinese were playing " a double game . . . supplying Maoist elements with weapons and money , instigating them to economic sabotage and assassination of prominent political figures . " // * Now Moscow plans for Asia ? in Helsinki mold // When it comes to Indo-China , Western observers in Moscow believe the North Vietnamese are still managing successfully to balance the Soviet Union and China off against each other . The Soviet line to nationalists in Southeast Asia is that they should push the remaining Americans out and should beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For their part , the Chinese have reportedly been telling non-Communist Southeast Asian leaders that they do not want remaining Americans to get out of the area too fast , as they fear this would leave a vacuum for the Russians to fill . Chinese media portray the Soviets as a threat in wanting to establish new military bases in the area . The Soviet Union incidentally still has no diplomats in Cambodia , and Soviet diplomats say they have no information from that country . They score the behavior of the Cambodians and blame this on Chinese influence . In domestic Chinese affairs , observers here do not expect that the rehabilitation of Lo Reich ing ? chief of the general staff ousted in 1965 ? will have any effect on Soviet-Chinese relations . Before his fall Mr. Lo was known as an advocate of a professional army , but he was not linked with any Chinese officers who were thought to be counseling better relations with Moscow in order to keep the Chinese Army strong . In analyzing domestic Chinese affairs , China watchers in Moscow tend to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backing of Chairman Mao Tse-tung . This view corresponds with the public analysis of Peking watchers in Taiwan . It contrasts sharply , however , with the prevailing Western analysis : that the moderates in China stabilized their control last January at the National Peoples Congress .
