She 's got a competition clutch , with four on the floor yeah , She purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar . . . She 's my little deuce coupe ; you do n't know what I 've got . <P> Little Deuce Coupe , by the Beach Boys , 1963 <P> Celebrated by rock balladeers and the gods and goddesses of the California youth culture , the sleek but mighty sports cars with high-powered engines were the knights templar of the American highway in the early 1960s . Inspired by the sports car craze , Detroit automakers created a new breed of small , racy , relatively inexpensive " sports compact " cars for young and old alike . The first of the new group , the Ford Mustang , made a fast breakaway in 1964 . It was rapidly followed by competing cars whose names evoked feelings of adventure and even danger : Plymouth 's Barracuda , Chevrolet 's Camaro , Pontiac 's Firebird , American Motors ' Javelin , Mercury 's Cougar , and the Dodge Charger ( later called the Challenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's car market , and souped-up " muscle " versions were introduced for the " performance " minded . <P> This year , however , as U.S. auto sales head toward an alltime record of about 10.2 million units , the market for the sports compacts is sputtering ( see chart ) . During the 1971 model year , their share of the market dropped to 5% , and in the past two months it has plummeted to 3.9% . At this year 's Detroit auto show , which ended last week , the sports compacts were elbowed to the sidelines by family sedans , high-ticket luxury models and by two categories of lightweight , low-cost cars : the compacts ( such as the Ford Maverick , Chevrolet Nova and American Motors Hornet ) and subcompacts ( such as Ford Pinto , Chevy Vega and Dodge Colt ) . Summarizing the change in taste , Chrysler Vice President Bob McCurry told TIME Correspondent David DeVoss : " The emphasis now is on practicality , quality and convenience , and it is the young people who are leading the parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sports compacts got too big and expensive . Since 1964 , the Mustang has grown 8 in. longer , 6 in. wider , and 630 Ibs. heavier , and its price has risen by $400 , to about $2,800 . Moreover , Government-required pollution-control devices are making the sporty cars sluggish . The toughest blow has come from the insurance companies , which have steadily raised the premiums on drivers of " high-performance " cars , including the sports compacts , because they-or at least their drivers-tend to be accident prone . <P> Automakers earn less profit on an ordinary compact than on a sports model , but they have found a way of cushioning the blow of declining sports sales . Ford , for example , now offers a " Grabber " model of its compact Maverick equipped with hood scoops , rallye stripes and a special paint job . It costs $175 more than an unadorned Maverick . Similarly , for $349 over the regular price , Chevrolet is marketing a " GT " version of the subcompact Vega with a black grille , racing steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being fast sports cars , but beneath the paint they are still economy cars with little engines .
