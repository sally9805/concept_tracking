FOR the past five years , with America 's energies and fears focused on Viet Nam , Washington pretty much took Europe for granted . Now the Administration is noticing the Continent in a way that suggests that Europeans may soon want a new era of benign neglect . " Maybe we 've all been under a delusion , " mused one State Department official recently . " We thought that Nixon 's ' Year of Europe ' would denote an approach of sweetness and light , coupled with the main attention being paid to the Continent . I think Europe will get prime attention , but seemingly it wo n't be all sweetness and light . " <P> In the view of many experts , the U.S. today has the worst relations with the Continent since World War II . To J. Robert Schaetzel , former Ambassador to the EEC , the situation has become nothing less than a " dialogue of the deaf " - which probably means a lot of shouting in 1973 and beyond . After years of seeming inattentiveness , there is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even well-informed Americans are somewhat baffled . For years Americans were accurately known as better Europeans than the Europeans themselves . Whatever happened , they now ask , to that great dream of helping to build a strong , unified and prosperous Europe , which has guided U.S. foreign policy since World War II ? <P> Essentially , the dream remains unchanged ; in fact , it is being realized . But as with all dreams when they begin to become real , the effects can be unsettling . To the U.S. , the most disturbing effect is of course economic . Shortly after the devaluation of the dollar last month , President Nixon instructed Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz to get a " fairer shake " for U.S. trade , even if he had to threaten protectionism . Faced with a massive and seemingly irreversible balance of payments deficit , the U.S. has begun to demand trade and monetary concessions-and to question whether Western Europe is carrying its share of the common defense burden . <P> " Nursing our economic wounds , preoccupied with domestic issues , uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we have become more annoyed with our allies than with our enemies . " Nonetheless , he adds that the U.S. is not solely to blame : " All of the countries have become egocentric . " <P> Says Raymond Vernon , director of Harvard 's Center for International Affairs : " The U.S. thinks of itself as if the wily Europeans have somehow got the better of us , as though we 've had too much of the burden and cost and been weakened . There 's a sense of being put upon . Many European leaders , however , see us as a country of overriding strength . " <P> An old American complaint about Europe recently renewed is that it is unrealistic . Princeton Professor Edward Morse , writing in Foreign Affairs , argues that , despite the almost universal agreement in Europe that any reduction in the present level of U.S. troops on the Continent would leave everyone worse off , Europe has confronted none of the consequences of withdrawal .               @ @ @ @ @ @
