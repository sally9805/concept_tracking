txt If the United States were organized like the Soviet Union , the world would be well accustomed to hearing Jimmy Carter speak alternately as President and as leader of the international democratic movement . No one would then be troubled when he celebrated democrats the world over , including those languishing in Soviet prisons , sent them birthday greetings and bade them keep up the good fight until the progressive forces had made the world safe for freedom . He could do all this even while , as President Carter , he was offering to collaborate with the Soviet Union in areas of mutual interest , with due respect for Soviet sovereignty . As President , he would refrain from meddling in anyone 's internal affairs . As democrat , he would vigorously but peacefully pursue the " ideological struggle . " That is precisely what the new President is doing , but in an American structure that requires him to speak from a single office . It is what Soviet officials have done for decades  --  alternating in their roles as leaders of government and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . it is understandable that they do not enjoy having the tables turned on them , but odd that they pretend not to know what is going on . Speaking for the overwhelming majority of Americans , Mr. Carter seeks to project an American vision of human rights and political freedom and an interest in seeing them prosper everywhere . It is a posture that Americans have held through much of their history , and which their history entitles them to hold . It is an inspiration in many lands . It is also a posture that plainly irritates many governments , certain of which violate American concepts of human rights not because they enjoy being beastly to their own people but because they think they can not hold political power without repression . If they find the American criticism so offensive that they feel compelled to reject this country 's aid . as Brazil . Argentina and some others have , that is their right and a fit subject for American calculation . The Carter Administration has admitted some inconsistency , exempting South Korea from attacks , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calculation has been made in regard . to the Soviet Union as well . Instead of denouncing the entire Soviet system as undemocratic and repressive , which it is , Mr. Carter has shown sympathy only for the victims of the worst kind of persecution . He has emphasized that he is judging the conduct of the Soviet Government , not assailing its legitimacy . And he has elaborately reaffirmed an eagerness to carry on mutually desired negotiations , notably for the control and reduction of nuclear arms . The President 's two-track course has now drawn the first direct comment from Leonid Brezhnev , who , please note , carries only the title of Communist Party leader but acts also as head of the Soviet Government . He reaffirmed a desire to get on with arms control negotiations , improvement of trade and possible collaboration to bring peace to the Middle East . But he denounced the President 's acts of sympathy for his nation 's " dissidents " as interference in its internal affairs , saying they make normal development of relations " unthinkable . " More to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the various negotiations while showing " a definite level of mutual understanding and at least a minimum of mutual tact . " There , we suspect , is the nub of it . Mr. Brezhnev wants Mr. Carter to appreciate the troubles he faces in Soviet councils for trying to do business with the " enemy , " and to hold the American appreciation of Soviet , outcasts down to a tactful level . As the two nations begin to engage each other in actual negotiation , starting next weekend , that level is sure to be found as long as their interests coincide . The right way to read Mr. Brezhnev 's speech is as notice that these interests do overlap at many points . So there is no reason to charge the President with imprudence and no reason to charge Mr. Brezhnev with threatening to disrupt negotiations . Mr. Carter was right , though perhaps a mite less than tactful , in his reported comment that " some people are concerned every time Brezhnev sneezes . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
