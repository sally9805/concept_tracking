Just before Phase II clocked in on Nov. 14 , President Nixon allowed that he expected a " bulge " in prices during its first days . The opening decisions of the Pay Board and Price Commission make disturbingly clear that Phase II already consists of a good many more bulges and bumps than smooth roads . <P> The unions ' huffing and puffing has frightened the Pay Board 's business members into seeking labor peace at a high price . They have approved a wage raise for coal miners nearly three times as high as Phase IIs 5.5% guideline , and most members seem likely to take a permissive , placating view of labor 's " catchup " demands in the shipping , aerospace and railroad industries . By the same inflationary token , most of the increases granted by the Price Commission have been above the 2.5% overall average set for price hikes . <P> Horatio 's Stand . The impact of the coalworkers ' settlement hit quickly . Officials of the Old Ben Coal Corp. , a subsidiary of Standard Oil Co. of Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover fresh wage costs . The case will be decided this week . Commission members are well aware that coal operators unhappy with domestic prices can further increase their fast-rising export shipments , which are not subject to price controls . Coal users already protest that the companies are exporting too much , and that the result could be a dangerous winter shortage of fuel and electric power . Nevertheless , like Horatio at the bridge , Commission Chairman C. Jackson Grayson Jr . has vowed that employers will not be allowed automatically to pass along exorbitant wage hikes to their customers . In effect , the Price Commission has been forced into serving as the Pay Board 's monitor . <P> Detroit 's four automakers also applied for increases , and so far two have got them-an exemplary 2.5% for American and 4.5% for Chrysler . But after learning that General Motors , the industry price setter , had petitioned for only a 3% increase , Chrysler chiefs decided that they could really make do with the same and retreated to 3% . G.M. , which based its bid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models , at least scaled clown its original ambitions . Shortly before the price freeze , the company planned increases of 3.9% for 1972 . The .9% difference will save the average car buyer about $30 , and that is a victory for the Price Commission .
