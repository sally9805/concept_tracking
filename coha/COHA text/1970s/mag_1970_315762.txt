SUPPLIES of concrete and timber suddenly began vanishing all over Egypt . Some roads were closed to civilian traffic , as trucks bearing shrouded hardware rumbled to guarded sites in nighttime runs . Huge transport planes thundered ceaselessly into Cairo 's airport , disgorging men and equipment . These mysterious comings and goings a few months ago signaled a major expansion of the Soviet Union 's presence in Egypt . Some diplomats compare it to the beginnings of the U.S. buildup in South Viet Nam in the mid-1960s . <P> Most observers in Cairo date the buildup from Gamal Abdel Nasser 's secret three-day trip to the Soviet Union last January . At that time , Israeli aircraft were regularly making deep-penetration raids into Egyptian territory . Had the attacks continued , Nasser 's political position could have been severely shaken , and this in turn could have jeopardized Moscow 's massive investment in Egypt . <P> Alexandria to Aswan . The number of Russians in Egypt increased from 10,000 to 14,000 during the buildup . Of these , 4,000 are civilian technicians and their dependents : most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just south of Cairo and the Aswan High Dam . which will be declared officially completed in ceremonies next month . The civilians live mainly in Cairo 's Zamalek district in a community complete with its own school , social club and outdoor movie . Another 3,000 to 4,000 military advisers are assigned to the armed forces at every level of command from artillery crews at the Suez Canal to naval vessels in the Red Sea . " Today the Soviets are in on every decision . " an observer commented recently . President Nasser himself boasted in Khartoum last month that " Soviets are serving with our units everywhere . " At least a dozen Russian advisers have died in Israeli attacks . The major new elements of the Soviet presence : <P> - As many as 100 MIG-21j interceptors , along with 70 to 100 Soviet pilots plus crewmen . The planes , with a longer range , better radar and a more effective fire-control system than earlier MIG-21s flown bv Eevotians. are based at Cairo West , Beni Suef , Aswan , Mansura and Inshahs . Only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli pilots encountered one another ; in Aoril , over Lake Qurun southwest of Ca ; ro , Israelis suddenly discovered that the MIGs they were about to jump were being flown by Russian-speaking pilots . Both sides backed away and have steered clear ever since . <P> &gt;SA3 pround-to-air missiles , manned by 3.500 to 5.000 Soviet technicians . Six sites already surround the harbor of Alexandria . Six other sites encircle Cairo , and four more are a short distance away at Cairo West , where Russian forces have established their headquarters in a for mer British base . Four clusters of SA-3s protect the Aswan High Dam , two more are believed to be at Baltim on the Mediterranean coast , and others are at the Russian bases at Mansura and Inshahs . The number of SA3 sites , each with eight missiles and 100 to 150 men , may eventually reach about 50.
