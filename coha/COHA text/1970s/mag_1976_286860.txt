" To love , all ages owe submission , " wrote Alexander Pushkin . In his first major work in eight years , Choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton , 69 , has adapted for Britain 's Royal Ballet A Month in the Country , the Ivan Turgenev play about the foolish love of an older woman for a young man . Far from sad and tormented , however , Ashton 's musing on middle-age folly emerges as an airy confection of elegant humor , bittersweet lyricism and charm . <P> In its mood and rural setting , A Month in the Country is kin to Ashton 's Enigma Variations , his last important ballet , created before he retired as the Royal 's director . This time Ashton 's gift for evoking another age is enhanced by a musical collage of Chopin . Julia Trevelyan Oman conceived the costumes and pale beige and blue furnishings of the sumptuous dacha , with ladies in flowing skirts and gentlemen in ivory frock coats . This is quite the prettiest ballet to light the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour . <P> Love 's Power . Lynn Seymour dances the role of the vivacious Natal in , languishing in the midst of her family through the pastel days of summer . Her irrepressible son Kolia - danced with gymnastic virtuosity by Wayne Sleep - bounces his ball and rockets up in corkscrew jumps . With the entrance of Kolia 's tutor Beliaev ( Anthony Dowell ) , the sky outside darkens . Ominous chords sound in the orchestra and the curtains flutter - all of which seems to signify more than just a passing storm . Immediately Mama is smitten , as is Vera , her young ward , portrayed by Denise Nunn , whom Ashton plucked from the corps to complete his triangle . <P> There are no heroes or villains in A Month in the Country , only human beings submitting ruefully to love 's power . Seymour , an inspired actress , almost dances words as well as feelings . Ashton is one of ballet 's supreme storytell ers . His pas de deux resemble poems . Dowell dances a sonnet with Natalia , a schoolboy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coquettish maid . The clear dance designs , all curves and spirals , are infused with his classic sensibility . Let us hope for many another Ashton delight .
