LOVE <P> Directed by KAROLY MAKK Screenplay by TIBOR DERY <P> This exceptionally fine Hungarian film about death and renewal is made with a sort of serene melancholy , a rich understanding of the tone and textures of mortality . It is a quiet movie , of short focus but great perspective in its untroubled contemplation of the measure of loss . <P> Love derives much of its strength from the fine accumulation of gesture and detail that Director Makk has worked into the modest fabric of his story . An old lady ( Lili Darvas ) , nearly 100 and dying with dignity and resignation from the kind of fatigue that can not be diagnosed or reversed , lies all day in her bed , tended by a maid and by her daughter-in-law Luca ( Mari Torocsik ) . The old lady lives in a twilight of memory , where past and present tend to flow together into a kind of future-imperfect tense . The room is kept clean and carefully lit , although both the room itself and the world outside look dour and gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , like the old lady herself . <P> <P> Only her memories have any radiance . She thinks of riding through a misty forest , of a broad hat ribbon of black silk bought for her as a present by her husband , of a holiday with her family , all of them together in a small hotel room . Sometimes there are only bright flashes of objects recalled : a pair of spectacles , a boat , a book , a favorite hat . <P> Luca encourages the old lady 's reveries and replenishes her fantasies with letters apparently from her son Janos , who is said to be making a film in America . In fact , he is a political prisoner , serving a ten-year term for some unspecified crime against the state . Luca keeps this from the old lady , and instead constructs letters with elaborate lies about his success and about the richness of America . The old lady reads the letters with a large magnifying glass , thrilling to each detail like a child hearing a fairy tale , relishing the deception they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand it . <P> Makk and his two superb actresses excel at capturing the ambivalences between the old lady and her daughter-in-law , the mingling of affection and exasperation , rivalry and devotion . Soon , but quietly , the old lady dies . Not long afterward , her son ( Ivan Darvas ) is released from prison , with as little warning and reason as he was first put there . He savors , almost timidly , the sudden sensations of freedom , then , a little anxiously , returns home to his wife . Luca tells him of his mother 's passing , and he mourns , though not for long . In his wife he is reminded again of strength and of regeneration . The old lady 's death is balanced .
