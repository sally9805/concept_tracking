the matter of Doberman pinschers , I like dogs that are large and hairy and friendly and sleep a lot , with sad eyes behind the hair . When I was young , there was a lady on our road who had a Doberman pinscher , bred sharp , vicious , and streamlined , as they all are , like a honed wolf . It meant that whenever a neighborhood child was riding along the tar road on his bicycle , if the Doberman was out , there had to be an immediate leap from the bicycle , and a crouching on bruised knees behind a high stone wall , before the owner called her dog back . The dog was devoted to the lady , who , as it happened , did have cancer . For years , I thought of the devotion of Dobermans to their owners , and their savagery to others , as something almost in their favor . Almost . Then I read a newspaper story about a Doberman that had turned , after many years , upon its mistress , an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out that the lady must have run from room to room , trying to shut the door before the dog got to her , just too feeble or perhaps unbelieving to escape it . A love story gone off the tracks , one could say in a disillusioned moment . Far off . From time to time , I work with Will at the foundation , rewriting requests for grants . No such job technically exists , but that 's what I do . I try to recycle the film-is-the-medium and the **31;2498;TOOLONG people , and help the Blake fanatics and the street reformers who work very hard . Sometimes I miss , or lose , the point . Late-sleeping utopians , especially , persist like mercury . I am a fanatic myself , althoughnot a woman of temperament . I get nervous at scenes . I stole a washcloth once from a motel in Angkor Wat . The bellboy was incensed . I had to give it back . To promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselvesand our posterity  --  I believe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . I think a high tone of moral indignation , used too often , is an ugly thing . I get up at eight . Quite often now I have a drink before eleven . In some ways , I have overshot my mark in life in spades.  |p9I  was lying on a Mediterranean boat deck , on a windless day . It was odd that I should be there , but no more odd than my work , or the slums , or the places where people do find themselves as their luck shifts . A girl of eighteen was taking the sun with great seriousness . The rest of our party were swimming , or playing cards below , or drinking hard . The girl was blond , shy , and laconic . After two hours of silence , in that sun , she spoke . " When you have a tan , " she said , " what have you got ? " I have zoomed around a lot in the brief times between months of idling . I have a tendency to get stuck in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxor , Egypt . I had been sent to Cairo by the paper . There were loudspeakers and angry rallies in the streets . I went to the pyramids and rode a camel . Then , I went to a briefing at the embassy . The foreign minister spoke of Israeli options and attrition . I wrote it down . I took a plane , an Ilyushin , to Luxor and looked at the tombs there . I arrived for my flight back to Cairo three hours early . So did others . We were told that our flight had been taken over by an American Bible-tour group called " Nine Days in the Holy Land , " whose own flight had been cancelled . The scheduled people with reservations were all planeless . I was frantic . I began to cry at the desk of an airport official . He wrote it down . One of the Bible tour 's two leaders said that if a single person from his group was left off the plane the tour would never again come to Egypt . I wondered where else they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land " to . Anaheim , Azusa , Cucamonga . I was desperate . The Egyptian pilot looked at me a second . Just before takeoff , he led me to the cockpit , where I sat , with one of the group 's two guides , beside him . The threatening tour guide had been left behind . We flew with a certain exhilaration . A few days after that , there was the war.  |p10I  know someone who is trying to get rid of a myna bird  --  I mean , find a loving owner . For a year now , he has spent half an hour each day underneath a dark cloth with the bird and a timer . He says hello , hello , hello for the entire session . The bird says nothing . It sometimes squawks at sunrise . Then there is the question of apartments . Lucas , who has the desk beside mine at the paper , moved into a place where the last tenant somehow left a lonely cat . Lucas is one of the nicest people I know ; he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . Finally , he heard of someone who already had four cats . He called her . " Well , you see , I already have four cats , " the girl said . " I know , " Lucas answered . He just thought maybe a fifth . . . " No , no , " the girl said . " I mean four extra cats . Somebody gave me . " There was a pause . " Oh , what the hell , " she said . Lucas brought the ninth cat over . Next door , there is a twelve-year-old who wants to give her rabbit to somebody with a happy home out in the country . She is obsessed with the idea that the wrong kind of person might take the rabbit in bad faith and eat it . She thinks somebody ate her gerbil . No one eats gerbils . It is strange to think that most of the children under six whom one knows and loves , gives presents to , whatever , are not going to remember most emotional events of those first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a bank , wherever they may find themselves when they are twenty-five . I have been lucky , in my work , at getting visas to closed places . My family have all kept fresh , renewed passports ever since my parents left Europe before the war . Paul-Ernst was my father 's name when he was German . It became Pablo when he bought a Costa Rican passport . He was Paulo when we all became Italians in Lugano . Now he 's Paul on nights when he , improbably , plays poker . My own mind is a tenement . Some elevators work . There are orange peels and muggingsin the halls . Squatters and double locks on some floors ,  |p11a  few flowered window boxes , half-dressed bachelors cooling on the outside fire steps ; plaster falls . Sometimes it seems that this may be a nervous breakdown  --  sleeping all day , tears , insomnia at midnight , and again at four A.M. Then it occurs to me that a lot of people have it . Or , of course , worse . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet . Triangles , darker every day , isosceles . I thought , leukemia . I waited a few days and watched . It turned out that whenever I , walking barefoot , put out the garbage on the landing , I held the apartment door open , bending over from the rear . The door would cross a bit over the tops of my bare feet . That was all  --  triangle bruises . I took a little celebrational nap . " I yield to myself , " the congressman said , at the start of the speech with which he was about to enter history , " as much time as I will consume . " He was on the phone . I will ask her to dinner , he thought . I will accept her invitation to a party . I will laugh at whatever seems to constitute a joke in her mind , if she will only permit me , with the pact of affection still securely in our voices , to hang up . She continued to talk through her end of the phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reproach him . When he tried an animated tone , she seemed encouraged to continue . She kept patting every sentence along the line with a little crazy laugh . I do n't know how many people have ever seen or passed through Broadway Junction . It seems to me one of the world 's true wonders : nine crisscrossing , overlapping elevatedtracks , high in the air , with subway cars screeching , despite uncanny slowness , over thick rusted girders , to distant , sordid places . It might have been created by an architectwith an Erector Set and recurrent amnesia , and city ordinances and graft , this senseless ruined monster of all subways , in the air . Not far away , there is that Brownsvillep12section of crushed , hollowed houses , an immense metropolis in ruins , with an occasional junkie , corpse , demented soul intent upon an errand where no errand can exist . There ca n't even be rats , unless they 're feeding on each other . Then , just on the edge of this deserted strangeness , there begins a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groceries , one or two policemen . Once , along the border street , I saw an endless line of Cadillacs , with men in suits and hats , with chauffeurs and manicures and somber faces . An owner of a liquor store had passed on to the funeral home . The Italians who run that community were paying their respects . The actual street neighbors seemed divided between obligationsto the dear departed and protocols toward the men in Cadillacs . Nothing for the foundation here . Nothing for the paper , either . No events . " Any dreams ? " the doctor asked his patient softly , tentatively , as we used to say in the child 's card game , " Any aces ? Any tens ? " In actual fact , the lady on the Boeing 707 from Zurich was talking to me about seaweed . I had just come from St. Moritz and she from Gstaad . Nearly all the other passengers were in casts from skiing . Her husband had invented a calorie-free spaghetti made from seaweed . He had invented other seaweedproducts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's yet unacknowledged living authority on seaweed and its many uses . She was quite eloquent about it . I was interested for nearly seven hours . My capacity for having a good time exists . It surfaces , however , on odd occasions . Everybody 's capacity for having a good time . It must have been fun before the casts , and there will always be another season . The man who hurls himself in order to be the last person through the closing doors of an already overcrowdedsubway pushes , after all , some timid souls in frontp13of him . Maybe the stresses of winding toward the millennium . " Well , you know . His wife was chased by an elephant . " " No . " " How extraordinary . " " Yes . It was too awful . They were watching the elephants , when she simply fell down . The elephant ran over and knelt on her . She was in the hospital for months . " " No . " " How extraordinary . " " Quite different from anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after day , when I still worked at the Forty-second Street branch of the public library , I saw the same young man , bearded , intense , cleaning his fingernails on the corners of the pages of a book . " What are you studying for ? " I asked him once . The numbers were flashing over the counter as the books came up . " Research , " he said . " I 'm writing my autobiography . " There are certainly odd people in that reading room  --  one who doodles the same bird endlessly on the back of a half of a single bank check , one who hums all the time , and one who keeps asking the other two to stop . A little pantomime concerto . I quit that job soon . The trouble is , I sometimes understand that research project . Or I did understand it . Then . " What a riot ! " a girl of about twenty-five , not thin , exclaimedas the de Havilland Otter started down the runway of the Fishers Island airport . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sparse mustache asked nervously . " I paid for my ticket twice . They pulled the Fishers Island  --  New York section by mistake , in Groton . Now there 's this . " " It 's all right , " I said . " I was in a plane like this when I was studying crisis conditions in Southeast Asia . They havep14outhouses behind their huts , over the rivers . Then they eat the river carp . Ecology . Everyone trusted these planes . The worry was just bombs and mortars . They seemed most concerned about the local cockfights . Gamecocks . I had never seen one till I went there . Ben Tre . It no longer exists . For flights I have these pills . " " The Wright Brothers ' special , " the Fishers Island girl continued . A clattering began under the floor of the plane 's midsection . All ten passengers started their own tones of laughter . The clattering was overlaid with creaking . " Can you believe it ? " the girl said . " It 's fantastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds and have to pedal , " a sailor said . He was stationed in Groton . The plane incessantly jarred , bounced , and tilted . I counted and found I had enough painkilling pills for everyone . " I always pack too much whenever I travel , " a lady said quite loudly as the windows fogged . " We 're moving from New York . My son has been mugged six times . He 's just eleven . We ca n't keep buying him new watches . " She went on like that . The twoticketman held on to my wrist so tightly that my own watch left marks for hours after , on the white ring watches leave inside a tan . We landed at LaGuardia . The young man let go . Another weekend . Any dreams . P.O. Box 1492 . The school was run by Communists , although few parents were aware of that . The grades ran from one to twelve . The younger children slept throughout the year on a screened-in open porch that was thought , in wintertime , to confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one single bed , near the door , for the child who was held to be the most disturbed in any given year . Late at night , the oldest told horror stories . Later still , the most disturbed child would bang her head against the bedpost in her sleep , or cry , or speak in no known language , whatever the disturbance that year was . Before dawn , the rest leaped wildly from top bunk to top bunk , sometimes single file ,  |p15sometimes  racing , sometimes three leapers side by side at a single time . Once or twice in those years , somebody crashed and broke a leg . We voted constantly on everything  --  issues and offices of every kind . We were expected at every age to have an opinion on all matters , political matters in particular . Although pressurefrom the teachers that year was clearly for Wallace ( Henry , not George ) , the teachers restrained themselves  --  nominally because they valued our independent judgment , actually because they lived in dread of our petitions . We fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that half a pound of feathers weighed more than half a pound of steel . We were adamant . Knowledge itself was a democracy . We studied fanatically . We were as competitive as only a child state can be . We voted to stone the girl who banged her head  --  not because she banged her head , but because she was so fat and furtive and whining all the time . She lost a loafer running from us across the athletic field . None of the stones hit . We were too uncoordinated and too young to throw accurately across the distance we had also , in all fairness , voted for . The space-time continuum became clear to us with that event . So , perhaps , did the quality of mercy , after all . We did not vote to fire the shop teacher , although we wanted to . We planed and sawed and used the lathe and soldered , making Christmas presents for our families . Christmasin all wildly progressive schools was celebrated with obsessional gravity . In one year 's holy pageant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverently by the boy behind . A father leaped to the balcony and put the fire out . Parents were allowed to visit every other Sunday , and for pageants and plays . Excellent evidence . " The source said that the investigators considered the responses of the dogs excellent evidence , ' " the Times reported . " In each case the two dogs reacted positively to Mr. Hoffa 's scent . One by standing up , " the story went on , " and the other by sitting down . " Since Willp16is a lawyer and I used to be an investigative reporter , we conclude that the dogs went to different schools , one to a sitting school , one to a standing school , but anyway to differentschools . There were , of course , in all such places , compulsory classes in ballet . Boys and girls , in leotards , lying around the resined floor in ballet class , were all instructed to listen , eyes shut , to Chopin or the Firebird or something , and let the mind run freely over whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The music played . Pensive children mused . Ambitious children worried . Homesick childrengrieved . Everyone lay still . Suddenly , the ballet teacher would swoop down and pick up somebody 's hand or foot . Newcomers were often startled into a small scream . After the first few times , they regained control . Determined then to show just how relaxed they were , they would obligingly help to raise the swooped-at hand or foot , try even to anticipate the swoop . " Why , you 're not relaxed , " the teacher  --  quite commonly a psychology major , born in Riverdale and recentlydivorced from an Algerian or Pakistani  --  would say , in astonishment and reproach . " Look at it . Why , just look at this foot . " She would hold the foot a moment , and then let it go . For normally nervous children , there were two possibilities : being left with a raised foot ; or being just alert enough to let it drop , not limply , however , as it was meant to fall , but like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , of dance , the teacher would deal in earnest with that hand or foot ; and if you did not have a nervous breakdown then , you had presumably acquired  --  as from that wintry open porch ; as , for that matter , from being sent away to boarding school at the age of six or eight  --  another immunity . It was always , of course , rumored that somebody in these classes , out of pure calm , fell asleep . But like that other , more flamboyantand dangerous story , which was told in public schools  --  that some child had lain down between the railroad tracks in town , and had remained there , relaxed and unharmed ,  |p17while  all the cars of a train passed over him  --  it was a fable . It was false . " I 'm sorry . Mr. Ellis has stepped out . He 's on another line . He 's in a meeting . Mrs. Harwell ? Oh , just a minute . She 's away from her desk . " There is a particular fanaticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The camps may sound either drawn from Hiawatha , or like a condition that will require surgery  --  my brothers went to Melatoma , I to SighingRock . The schools will be named for an improbable condition of the landscape ( Peat Cliff , Glen Willow Sands , Mount Cove , Apple Valley Heights ) , or for something dour and English : Gladstone Wett . The riding teachers are named Miss Cartwright , Miss Farew , Martha Abbott Struth . Ms. Struth , if she is married , will have her own academy , which teaches every horse thing from gymkhana to dressage . Mr. Struth has been away or dead for twenty years . Field hockey coaches , whistles hanging from their necks , brown and white oxfords on their feet , may stride , with their emphatic , shoulder-inflectedhockey walk ; they can shout , exhort , scold , shrilly whistle , keep a red and frosty silence , like their counterpartson football fields . All field coaches carry on  --  as though those fractures , scars , grunts , knockouts , limps , and broken noses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for boys , seeming to them , perhaps , such useful skills to have in adult life . These coaches , male and female , have always had disciples . In fact , I know of no one who was a boarding student at a wildly progressive school , in those years , who did not incur a slight , though permanently laming or disfiguring injury on its fields . But it was horses that held the imagination ; it has always been the riding teachers who preside . At that school , sex and mysticism set in , simultaneously . We used to walk through the dark , from our porch , to the stables , where we imagined that a horse had died , untendedp18and alone . We had not been told . Couples , late at night , holding hands , looking for the corpse of Gladys  --  who had , in fact , been sold , the school having fallen on hard times . We slept in the hay above the stalls . We returned to our porches before dawn . The school has since gone entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methedrine . In our time , we planned but did not even dare to run away . We had codes , ceremonies , aliases . We had oaths . We had marathon walks and rides . Once , on the morning of the middle children 's all-day ride , with the night to be spent in sleeping bags , a matter of great ritual importance to us then , a small girl from a theatrical family said to us , in parting , " Break a leg . " We had a unison of panic . Superstition had become intense . Myra Miller broke a leg . It was my fault . I had a dread by then of our most skittish , lightest horse . It always seemed , in his nervousness and mine , that I was gliding on unsteady air . I was assigned that horse . The first time he shied  --  at a flower , I think  --  I fell off , deliberately . Myra , who had been given the phlegmatic nag I longed for , took advantage of the flash of fear to spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse years , no doubt , to gallop through the woods , with frightenedeyes . Myra gave a rebel yell , and used a switch . The nag galloped too close by a tree , which , like Absalom 's , singled Myra out  --  not by the hair but by the leg . Her leg was broken by the time she fell . I was left with her while the rest of the expedition went for help . " Anything I can do ? " I kept saying . Myra would say , " Oh , Christ . " I have since heard this precise exchange many times , out here . Then Myra 's mother came . Not a play , or pageant , or Sunday  --  Myra 's accident . The mother and I talked . There was a bath schedule outside the porch bathroom  --  each child having been allotted an uncapitalist three baths a week . " I have to go to the loo , " Myra 's mother said . She tried to commit suicide in there . Not very seriously . With nail scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , when the ambulance came . " Myra 's all my fault . " That was probably true . The fault for the leg was mine . I rode , on the school 's insistence ,  |p19the  same skittish horse all term after that . I reined him back till his mouth was wrecked for the snaffle , and the curb was all that would hold him back . The riding teacher used to throw stones at him to make him go . When he went , I would fall off at once . Ten years ago , I was in Mississippi , covering blacks , whites , troopers , Klansmen , nuns , whoever there was . The F.B.I . had already infiltrated the Klan to the extent that , by whatever means , they had demoralized and almost destroyed it . A small-town klavern , run by a gas-station attendant , did discover an agent in their midst . They drove him to a dark , deserted road . He conceded that they 'd caught him . His predicament was trouble . He also promised that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Bureau would come down and blow the Klansmen 's heads off . They did nothing to him . That klavern dispersed . Later , when there still seemed to be an obdurate nest of Klansmen left in Mississippi and Louisiana , it was rumored that some F.B.I . men , having tried all sorts of warnings and persuasions , drove a few of the unrelenting to another rural road and blew their heads off . It may not be true . Agents from that time and place will just grin when they are asked . She was a dynamite girl and he was an aces fellow . On the day he at last agreed by phone to marry her , the switchboard operators were overjoyed . For six months they had listened , in sympathy and indignation , to the tears , the threats , the partings and reconciliations . They were so unequivocally for the girl that only the purest professionalism kept them , at times , from breaking in . On the day Tim , after calls to his best friend , his first wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator , who had been on the switchboard for twenty years , actually wept . The other two told the receptionist , at lunch . All four ladies had a drink , and then bought a card of slightly obscene felicitations . They had wavered toward the sentimental , but rejected it as basically unswinging . Theyp20did not sign the card . Tim and his girl , who had been breakingup once again on the day they received it ( she was packing ; they were in his apartment ) , were appalled . As a result of the card , and discussions of what to do about it  --  what it implied , who knew and who did n't  --  they married . A physicist I first met when he was working on a governmentmilitary project recently turned to drastic civil disobedience . When I went to visit him and his wife in their Village apartment , the phone rang constantly  --  two rings for one sort of friend , ten for another . " If it took an act that I might go to jail for to bring my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " then it was n't pointless , was it ? " The apartment was filled with friends from other days , other lives , looking tired and talking . The doorbell kept on ringing . A young priest would go downstairs and check . " Who was that ? " the physicist said when the priest came back alone . " A man from the Daily News , " the priest said . " I told him you were n't here . " A reader of the News objected . " They had a petition protesting their own coverage of this kind of story . Maybe he signed it . " The physicist was out the door and halfway down the block in a minute . He came back . " I found the guy , " he said . " I asked him whether he signed . He said no , he felt he could do more by not signing , by positive action in covering just this kind of story . I thanked him . I asked him to convey my thanks to the people who did sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate it more if you wrote them a personal note . I said , Oh , no , I feel I can do more by positive action in just this kind of conversation . " When I first came to New York , a man I somehow knew , a film producer , took me from my job at the school where I was then working to dinner at the Colony . Before dinner , I was to meet him at his St. Regis suite . I arrived ten minutes late and knew at once it was an error . I should have waited twenty minutes . I had just started smoking weeks before.  |p21Over  drinks in the suite , he lighted my cigarette . The match fell on the rug . I picked it up . Another error . He was a nice man . After dinner , he walked me up all six flights of the place where I was living . " It 's been so long since I 've seen a girl 's apartment , " he said . After a while , there was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my age , is it ? " he said , earnestly . He was seventy-four . " No , no , " I said , " I guess I 'm just neurotic . " That seemed all right . We became friends . At one point , he thought I might be the girl for his son , another film producer . It was awkward for the son and me , at Trader Vic 's , trying to be a generation . The son said he had three files of projects : one marked A through Z ; one A prime through Z prime ; and one marked Miscellaneous . He said that only since his analysis had he come to realize how much he had to offer . The line stuck with me , though  --  I guess I 'm just neurotic . Nothing else seemed to work quite so well , to be so serviceableand friendly . You do n't care to . I do n't care to . It is n't a New York obligation . There 's already somebody . I do n't like the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not an agency . Whatever . Being neurotic seemed to be a kind of wild card , an all-purpose explanation . Other ways , of course , are straighter . I do n't know . An old friend  --  the physicist , in fact , before he married  --  once told me that a sister of a friend of his had sexual problems . I said , oh . He said that , when they had both been in Bolivia at a meeting , he 'd made a pass at her . She was n't interested . He asked her why . She said " You just do n't attract me physically . " That was it . For him , the inference was problems . Maybe there is no polite way . There do n't seem to be many instances of the pure straightforward . And yet . Will is away a lot . I have my man buried to his neck in boiling mud . He does not care to speak to them . He has his own problems . He does not want an interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Some sort of parable about reporting there , I think .

Her nails were extremely long and red . She was wearing silk trousers and pumps . She looked at her fellow students in sneakers and jeans , with their canvas sacks and pickaxes , and at the slate cliffs they seemed prepared to go straight up . She declined . " I just do n't see the sense of it , " she said . Bootsy got off the bus all three nights , did her nails , set her hair , and slept in the dingy hotel above the movie house with the rest of us . She was by no means one of the great refusers . Not an existentialist hero , or a Rosa Parks , or even a Bartleby . She simply did not see the sense of it .

She passed . The rest of us climbed the cliffs and hills , looked at entrenched meanders , terminal moraines , glacial detritus , relief maps of the Delaware Water Gap , and outcroppings of the Wissahickon Mica Schist . None of it has since been of much use to me . I can tell an entrenched meander to this day . It means that the riverbed is old and that the river has doubled back to cut its own deep loops .

None of us is , however , at all one of those stencil bohemians who live in the Village , cultivate for their public lives something leftish and for their private lives a guru or an analyst , who are likely to be by birth and accent New York , and who are likely at parties to have somewhere in the room a stereo ; elsewhere a baby , pale and whimpering , until its mother , having until last week breast-fed it at just such parties as this one , mashes a little phenobarbital into its bottle and around its pacifier ; elsewhere still one large Cuban or Jamaican , who is cooking something difficult , which includes rice and bananas and which , since it is very late and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be joylessly , sickly drunk all eveningon the Gallo wine and sangria in paper cups .

She was always being called by heavy breathers . Recently , she moved out to Chicago , as a full professor . She decided to list her full name , Phoebe Aaron .

Vlad , who wants to specialize one day in surgery on adult hands , finds himself these days working on babies .

I once saw , however , what might have seemed an altogether hopeless old man on crutches , making his way out of Disneyland , with a large Mickey Mouse balloon . In Bootsy Garn 's final college year , my first , the girl across the hall from me bought a snake . The girl 's father had been a famous American fascist in the thirties . It was assumed the girl had problems . But pets were not permitted in the dorms . The college knew nothing of the snake . The girl in the room next door to mine bought an alligator . Her father was head of a chemical corporation in Cincinnati . The girl was beautiful . She held seances . She had an Austrian boyfriend , older than she by enough to have been a true Nazi in his time , who threw stones through her window and shouted " Annelise , Annelise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed her little alligator halves of worms . Her name , in fact , was Anne . The girls in another dorm bought ducks . The girl three rooms down the hall from me had an orgone box . She believed in silence at breakfast , and used to enforce it by staring craftily at a bread knife with jam on it . An African princess , in her third year and wildly in unrequited love , tried to kill herself one evening by taking an overdose of Epsom salts . She fell in convulsions in front of the dining-room door . Rumors had begun to reach the dean 's office . Something amiss . Anne asked me to hide her alligator in my room for a night or two . I thought , This must be college , what the hell . Three nights I heard dry feet and scales dragging forlornly across my floor . The creature missed the damp . I took it to the bathtub in the early-morning hours . The third day , I leftp26it there . Just before nine , the fascist 's daughter decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must have crawled out through its mesh . She thought it had entered the radiator and was now at large in the heating system . It was a very small snake , red , yellow , and black . Bootsy went straight to her room , locked the door , and screamed . For thirty-six hours , she refused to come out . The rest of us , rather dreading the emergence of the snake from our own radiators , avoided our rooms . Bootsy just stayed , and then , the following evening , came quietly out and took a bath . Neither the alligator nor the snake was seen again . Those of us who were studying the English Drama Until 1642 resumed our course . And now I 'm here . The girl in the hallway of Sam 's building , as I was rushing home , was much too fast asleep . She did not look sick . She was not unkempt . She just did not seem entirely alive . " Hey , " I said . " Excuse me . Are you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her lap , large purse by her side . A man walked in from the street . " Excuse me , " I said . " Does this girl look all right to you ? " He looked at her a while . She made no flicker of a move . " Do you know her ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " Do you ? " He shook his head , crossed the hall to the elevator , got in , and was gone . I went back upstairs and rang Sam 's bell . I said , " There 's something wrong with a girl who 's sitting in your hall . " Sam came downstairs with me . " Hey , " he said , shaking her shoulder a bit . She just sat there , asleep . Sam took one of her clasped hands , lifted it , and let it drop . " Do you think we should call an ambulance ? " I said . " Maybe we should look in her bag first , and see who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want an ambulance . " I said , " If you look in her bag , though , they 'll think it has something to do with you .

She went home.  |p27I  think when you are truly stuck , when you have stood still in the same spot for too long , you throw a grenade in exactly the spot you were standing in , and jump , and pray . It is the momentum of last resort . Some people get a jump on the morning in other ways  --  speeding on the highways , making money , doing crossword puzzles , a darker tan , a whiter wash , accumulations of various kinds . The thing about doing the Sunday crossword is that halfway through you may find yourself tracking a mind you loathe .

I tend to blast myself out of bed into situations that are drastically odd , with a moral edge , perhaps , and an element of risk . I took a plane once from an Angolan island of eccentrics to what was then Biafra , on a Joint Church Aid load of fish . In the thunder and lightning , and Valium and a sense of incongruity , it was fine . There were only three journalists there then , in the penultimatedays of Biafran misery . We had been told to bring cans of food , jerry cans of gasoline , and a lot of Scotch . One evening , we drank some of the Scotch in a bungalow , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should go home , meaning my bungalow . One of the journalists said he knew the way , even in the dark .

Finally , we found my bungalow . I 'm out . We 're still here . Biafra 's not . Before the SixDayWar , I had bought a Patek Philippe watch and a Chanel suit . I do n't know why . They had a song on the Biafran roads . " He is dead . Got to bury him . He died in a state of courage . May his soul rest in peace . "  |p28The  truth , I would like to say here , is as follows .

" I often wonder about the people who linger over trash baskets at the corners of the city 's sidewalks . One sees them day and night , young and old , well dressed , in rags  --  often with shopping bags  --  picking over the trash . They pick out newspapers , envelopes . They discard things . I often wonder who they are and what they 're after . I approach and can not ask them . Anyway , they scurry off . Sometimes I think they are writers who do not write . That " writers write " is meant to be self-evident . People like to say it . I find it is hardly ever true . Writers drink . Writers rant . Writers phone . Writers sleep . I have met very few writers who write at all . I visited the University of California at Santa Cruz once . It was rich , and near the sea , and full of redwoods . The students who did not care to walk to class were conveyed by surreys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student strike , since most things were permitted . Attendance in the classes was not taken . The only way to be on strike was to attend a class , and wear a black , identifiably striker 's armband . The students wanted to strike on behalf of the local people of Santa Cruz  --  who loathed them . The strike was a boycott of grapes . The students picketed the local stores that sold grapes . The locals bought up all the grapes and waved them in the students ' faces . There seemed to be no understandingamong anybody . The troopers were there to protect students from club-bearing locals . The students thought the locals were oppressed by troopers . Education , perhaps , in its own way , suffered .

A bomb went off . The explosion was enormous . Windows smashed . Doors fractured . The reception desk blew up . The lights went out . The first words after the thunder and reverberationsin the darkness were an imperturbable , incredulous , " Two hearts . " Another night , one of the intermittent bridge players wandered , barefoot , into the common room . She was known for her casual , oddly violent Guess Whats . " Guess what , " she said . The other players , noticing that even her feet , on the dusty , littered floor , were an uncharacteristic , American high school clean , guessed she was having an affair . No one in that place , that year , except Southern girls and narcissists seemed to wash any more thoroughly than life required . But the Guess Whats always made an immediate claim ; they never passed quite safely until someone guessed correctly or everyone gave up . Bathtub running over , pregnancy , expulsion from a Sorbonne class were guessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody moved . More guesses . The girl 's roommate made three no trump .

" Elaine 's was jammed , full of young women looking tired and their escorts , ignoring them in droves , talking to each other , man to man . The bachelor regulars brought a different girl each night or week or so , and then around midnight , dropped them flat . The beauty point was made . The menp30could talk , of royalties , pot , sex , screenplays , and politics .

" In a family with siblings , there is a constant war of reflexes . Nothing to do with checks  --  the opposite . A child is sitting there , with a toy or comic book . Flash . Gone . It takes a wary eye and an instant tightening of the grip , or the thing is gone . The gentlemen at the place are flashes with that check . The others  --  perhaps only children ?  --  always lose or look away . Matthew , the man I had arrived with , was drinking brandies . I was drinking gin . Suddenly , my zabaglione vanished , cream , cup , strawberry , and all . I had a distinct , an eidetic memory of seeing it there before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matt looked for it . It was nowhere . Somebody 's handbagwas on the floor beside my chair . I felt that a whole zabaglione could not have fallen , tidily , into a stranger 's handbag . I could n't search in a stranger 's handbag , anyway . We stopped thinking about it . Matthew said that he had been very fat as a small boy . He read a lot . He ate . When he noticed how alarmed his parents were at how fat he was , he obediently laid his chocolate bars aside . Then , his parents were called to the school . It was a friendly , permissive , finger-painting sort of place . There was a huge papier-mache policeman in the hall . The policeman 's knee had begun to erode . Matthew had been eating papier-mache . He denied it at the time . He is quite slim now . We have all , of course , had childhoods . I do find that the person with the clearest , least self-serving simply pays . I remembered another Matthew , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , where there was a lake with fish . Matthew never caught one . We went trolling from a rowboat , casting from the shore . Sometimes , we used a bamboo pole and worms . We all caught fish but Matthew . He talked . We rowed him . Nothing happened . At first it was a triumph . Then we were embarrassed . Finally , my brothers had a thought . My older brother said that the secret of fishing in that lake was paper bags . Matthew said Oh , as though he had always known it . I rowed . My brothers put half a worm on Matthew 's hook  --  around that , a paper bag , with a fish concealed inside . In a few minutes , Matthew said he thought he had a bite . He reeled in . He was ecstatic with his half-dead perch . We never told him . Last year , I saw that Matthew , with his children , running for office in Chicago . He spoke of his boyhood , fishing , and of that afternoon when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it .

The waiter , a frail man with hair down to his shoulders , held a huge , ill-tempered , and obstreperous writer face down on the floor in a few seconds flat . The whole restaurant grew quiet for a minute , hummed again . The writer began another scuffle . The waiter dragged him out into the street . Squad cars arrived .

The food had been awful , the babies had wailed , seventy-two headsets had broken down before the start of the movie . The top third of the screen was , as usual , cut off at the ceiling . Little air vents had blown into the passengers ' eyes for nine hours ; there had been sneezes all over the aircraft , and cries of " Salud . " The washrooms had broken down halfway through the flight , also as usual . The stewardess was still walking the aisles , spraying scent . The waiting-room music , designed for calm during dangerous minutes , had played during takeoff , and now began droning for landing . We landed .

Leaving aside minor jackpotshit in pay phones ( which seem only fair , considering the change one loses when those things are out of order ) , last month I found a quarter in the back seat of a cab . Nobody saw . I have no regard for the law in these matters , as in several others . By law , I think , it now belonged to the owner of the cab . He was not there . A passenger had clearly lost it . He was gone . In the end , having noticed that the driver of the cab was black , I gave it up . I said , " Excuse me . I think you have lost this quarter . " He said , " Thanks . " An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminary , had the fine solution . He said I should have given a different quarter to the driver , kept the one I found . I wish I 'd thought of it .

I put on jeans and a shirt . I took some Scotch along . The emergency ward was full of the slightly injured , mainly knife wounds at that hour , and Sam . Nessa was having her thumb set . We of the emergency ward passed around the Scotch . When Nessa came out , with the intern who had put a cast on her thumb and wrist , it was 3:15 . On the way out of the hospital , I thought I was going to faint . Then , I thought how unseemly it would be to have to be carried back into the hospital .

As Sam put the key in the lock , her mother-in-law stood there , distraught . She looked at Sam , with his rimless glasses and his beard , and at me in my shirtp35and jeans . She screamed . Then she started to cry . She looked at Nessa . " I knew it , " she said . " What have they done to you ? " Last night at dinner , a man said that , on principle , he never answers his telephone .

When I was last at my wit 's end , I dreamed I parked my car on my way to my stabled horse and found the country roadside absolutelyp36strewn with silver .

As homesickness , at camp or school , can be a first intuition of death and bereavement , this creeping thing is most nearly a child 's premonitory sense of mortal illness .

The next day there was a neat circle of poison ivy around her wrist . That was a friend .

It must be so in each lonely degrading thing from which one comes back having learned nothing whatever . There are no conclusions to be drawn from it . Lonely people see double entendres everywhere . There are times when every act , no matter how private or unconscious , becomes political . Whom you live with , how you wear your hair , whether you marry , whether you insist that your child take piano lessons , what are the brand names on your shelf ; all these become political decisions . At other times , no act  --  no campaign or tract , statement or rampage  --  has any political charge at all .

In recent years , always . I once met a girl called Yael in Beersheba , very poor , who always did , without reflection  --  gavea little something to each beggar , even ones she passed twice , even the most devastated . She did not look around to see who noticed , simply gave . Now every tin cup  --  with or without pencils , voice , accordion  --  stops me . It is not a bribe to my own fortunes any longer .

We also ran tests on each other  --  lie detectors , freewordassociations with a stopwatch ; the point turned out to be not what you said but just how long you stalled before you said it . Weekends , I took trains . You never knew whom you might meet .

One night , climbing a brick wall to the dorm long after hours , I got poison ivy . Totally . Again . Those ivy-covered walls . My case , however , was diagnosed as an allergy to something in the chemistry laboratory . I knew just what I did have , but I did n't argue long . My work had started to be awful . I allowed myself to be persuaded just to drop it . After graduation , we were all many times each other 's bridesmaids . The marriages were in Maryland , Boston , New Hampshire , California , Georgia , Maine . Just south of the Mason-Dixon line , on several weekends , young men  --  clean-cut , friendly , slightly tipsy  --  from Princeton or the University of Virginia Law School would rise late in the evening and propose a toast to the N.L.A. We all drank to it . I finally asked , and learned it was the Nigger Lynching Association . My friends from those days have changed as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In those days , too , there was the matter of religion , which tended both to start and to inhibit conversation .

There was another pause . Finally , he made another try . " Do you , " he asked , " know Eddie Warburg ? " But it turned out all right . Another bridesmaid , this one from Alabama , had brought an Argentine boyfriend from the Catholic Universityin Washington . He was very rich , with more profoundgood manners than any Anglo-Saxon I have met , but he had not troubled much with haircuts . After we had all swum awhile outside , the bride 's mother asked me in confidentialtones whether I thought she ought to drain the pool.  | " Well , you know , you ca n't win them all , " the old bartendersaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .

Will and I once went for a few days to the Caribbean , where we chartered what was called a yacht . He is married to his work , but there we were . Most of the boats had been rented by people from Chicago or Milwaukee . They were bossed around by the crews and owners . They wore strange shirts and shorts and drank a lot of rum .

They bought another boat from their profits on the first one , crossed the sea again , and began doing charters . They were not like the lounging , bossy owners .

My new life has its contrasts . One weekend , I was sent to cover a hospital in Brooklyn  --  municipal , enormous , patients mostly black . My subject was the emergency ward on weekends , but a middle-aged black doctor , graduate of Howard in the thirties , took me on a tour . The wards were jammed  --  diseases , fractures , burns . The severely burned had a little ward room of their own because they so depress the other patients . Wounded criminal suspects had semiprivate rooms with police outside them . These were luxury accommodations . All patients  --  even those about to " slip away , " in the doctor 's euphemism  --  were silent , except one white lady who screamed occasionally from senile psychosis . It was as though the entire place were drugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corridor , her bed alongside the wall , blocking the water cooler .

All else was silent . I thought I 'd had my tour when the doctor , returning to his office , noticed a silhouette through his glass-panelled door . " Oh , " he said . " This will interest you . You must n't miss this . " Then he told the young black man waiting in the office that his sister was about to slip away . We went down the ward to see the sister . I was introduced and said , " How are you ? " She said , " Fine thanks . How are you ? " Toward early morning , activity in the emergency ward accelerated , a catastrophe a minute , mostly victims of knife fights whom other hospitals  --  uneasy with police cases  --  had simply passed along . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budapest , two were young Egyptians , all were gray with tiredness . A case arrived uponp41a stretcher . Two policemen asked routinely who had cut him .

She said quite softly to an intern , " That 's him . That 's the man that did it . " The intern called a policeman . The wife told of her husband 's being held against a tub in the hall bathroom of their building and cut , for reasons she could not explain . The young man himself had come in to have a knife wound on his right palm treated . When confronted with the story , and the evidence of his own wounded hand , the accused young man denied it . The police brought him to the man upon the stretcher . He leaned solicitously over the weak man and said , " I did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak man looked up and said , " Yeah , man . You did . You cut me . " Then he shut his eyes . They wheeled him to the operating room to fix him up . I am not technically a Catholic . That is , I have not informedor asked the Church . I do not , certainly , believe in evolution . For example , fossils . I believe there are objects in nature  --  namely , fossils  --  which occur in layers , and which some half-rational fantasts insist derive from animals , the bottom ones more ancient than the top . The same , I think , with word derivations  --  arguments straining back to Sanskritor Indo-European . I have never seen a word derive . It seems to me that there are given things , all strewn and simultaneous . Even footprints , except in detective stories , now leave me in some doubt that anyone passed by . People who are less happy , I find , are always consoling those who are more . At table , there are often one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker is not quite firm in what he 's stated , is still open to suggestion  --  open mind .

I have noticed that stammerers talk a lot . The chaplain ,  |p42though  , who was the best interpreter in the history of the monastery at the border , had a violent speech disorder in his native tongue . We had been standing outside his tent for eleven hours . The crowd was large . When at last he came out , the guru stared , then threw an orange , savagely . He returned to his tent . That was all . The other night , I interviewed a controversial diplomat , an ex- and future politician with strong ideas on air pollution . He took me home . By the time I had answered the telephone ringing in my bedroom , he had started an enormous fire in the fireplace of my living room . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken off his jacket , fixed himself and me a drink , and sat upon the sofa . He was so good at all this that for the first time in months I felt at home . For an hour and a half , I did not tell him that I had a deadline . By that time , the fire was blazing firmly and correctly . The diplomat had been a country boy . When I finally did mention my deadline at the office , he looked surprised , then said good-naturedly the brownstone would catch fire if we left the fireplace in flames . It was quite true . I asked him how to put it out . He said , " Sand , baby . " I have no sand in my apartment . We poured water from every pan and kettle in the kitchen . It took some time . We also drenched the carpet . When I woke up at noon the next day , the wet wood and ashes with a kettle still beside them looked like some desolate form of art . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not field work ) , some American anthropologists on Fulbrights gave a party for some Africans , in my apartment . The Africanswere all students at the Ecole Normale Superieure . They might one day all be prime ministers . A student from the Ivory Coast said he had as many names as the midwife could reel off in the moments when he was actually being born . The daughter of a former British high commissioner inp43Nigeria danced the high life with a student from the Belgian Congo . A small , blond French-Canadian girl left the party early , to go to bed with one of the Americans . She asked him later when they would see each other again . He said , " Do n't break the magic . " Afterward , he left for Mali . Most people left the party very late . It was a year when it was rumored that Life was going to do an article on American expatriates in Paris . Perhaps there is that rumor every year or two . In any case , the Americans stopped washing their hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining of publicity . At the party , though , they stayed so long I left and took a room in a hotel . The doctor we all loved in high school set fractures at the foot of the ski slope . He also worked part-time at the prison . Except for a spectacular , unsolved murder in the forties , committed by someone we all knew , the prison is the thing for which our town is known . It used to be known for its main street  --  which was an infuriating obstacle to traffic betweenNew York and Boston . But now there is a highway . The prison is important . We have had every major federal offender anyone can remember  --  corrupt , embezzling politicianswhile they were being re-elected , conscientious objectors , all sorts of federal offenders , radical clergy , spies . The prison baseball team plays with teams from the local stores and factories . On sports pages , the prison line-ups differ from those of local teams only by the omission of last names . Tom J. , from the prison , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor we all loved in high school went on from setting fractures to a flirtation with homeopathy . He could not bear suffering . When patients called to say they had colds , he would whistle and say God , I can hear it . When they had sprained ankles , he would inhale and say that he knew how it hurt , he had had sprains himself . Homeopathy failed him . He became a great internist , orthodox , modern . Then , he went to Tennessee , and found himself faced with victims of hexes . They were in comas . They seemed to be dying . Hep44tried orthodox medicine . They got worse . He got angry . Then he gave in . He started circling their beds three times , with lighted candles . That was the accepted practice in the region , and it worked . I have often been in hotels alone . It is no good unless you 're on assignment . One sits in the lobby , the bar , or worst of all the restaurant , with a book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables on the pages , and they stick . One summer , in Malta , I took a book from my hotel room to the beach . The beach was full of English tourists , grocers already tanned from fingertips to wrist , from hair to collar line , standing in bathing suits and shoes and socks , with arms folded across their chests , staring out to sea . Also blond divorcees , deeply brown , lying in beach chairs , with a transistor and perhaps one small weedy child digging in wet and littered sand . At the post office , there was an enormous lady with a considerable mustache , who took grave pleasure in slavering on all the stamps whenever anyone brought in a letter . I took off for a smaller island , Gozo , which was quieter . There was a sign quite near the water : CAUTION . Do NOT TOUCH OR PICK UP STRANGE OBJECTS FOUND ON THE BEACH . REPORT THEM IMMEDIATELY TO THE POLICE . Mines . Malta and Gozo had a rough time in the war . Our obituary writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , but he gets them in detail . I had just started working at the paper . He thought I was an alcoholic ; he told it to a man on night rewrite , who told it to all the people in the newsroom , who told it to the people at the culture desk . It is not so troubling to be thought an alcoholic ; still , I preferred not . When he asked me out to lunch , I gladly went . His parents are from Poland . His name is Standish HawthorneSmith . We went to a Greek restaurant . When we sat down , he held my hand . He asked me whether Will has his divorce . I did not know quite what to say . I asked about his work . He smiled . He asked what I would like to drink.  |p45Nothing  , I thought . Then I remembered that nothing would be the order of an alcoholic on the wagon . My normal Scotch and water would not do . I asked for an ouzo . No alcoholic in his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had two . Standish walked me home . He said he wrote , and read , a lot of poetry . When we got to my door , he asked whether he might use the phone . He made three phone calls , going to the kitchen now and then , to pour himself another vodka . I sat in the living room , with a glass of wine . I had altogether lost my sense of purpose in the situation . After his hour or two of phone calls , he came to the living room . " Do you know , " he said , " three things are said to be true of every Polish houseguest . First , he raids your icebox . Then he reads your mail . Then he fires the maid . " He walked to a window , pulled the curtains , asked whether I would like him to fire the maid . He finally read some poetry instead . Anyway , Will 's gone . I used to live with a graduate student of political science , a kind of Calvinist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother was a dancer . His father was a judge . Our mattress was on the floor . We had no lights or telephone . Each morning when he left , I cooked a meal according to a recipe , most carefully , then tasted it and found it good , and threw it out . A trial run . In two hours , he would be back from the library . We would have beer , two sandwiches , perhaps a nap . Then he would go back to the library . All afternoon , I would cook the meal again , with better confidence , studying the cookbook with the concentration I still had from graduate school . It would be supper this time , practiced , complicated , natural  --  after cigarettes and gin , which we drank neat . He had an intimation , a skepticism of all this domesticity . It seemed to me one of the minor deceptions , though most fraught . My friends , after all , were married  --  to men whose hours were already set . Adam might come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time . The food waste would have appalled him , the deception evenp46more . He lived on frankness and economy . He wrote sometimes : " The first sentence can be like the rapping of a gavel , or it can sidle up to endear itself . It can thump you on the back with fraternal heartiness , or it can tap you for a loan . There are writers like prosecutors , and others with a bedside manner , and others still , with that particular note of instructionwhich can drive you up the wall . The thing is , I recognizeevery literary style at once , and I detest them all . " So on . I was trying translations of some sort of diaries . " An appointment is less romantic than a rendezvous . A rendezvousis more clandestine than a date . How to explain , then , that I saw my lover yesterday , that he is a prince , an assassin , a masterspy . And also my immediate boss . No , no . " I simply could not cook . Logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were entirely alien to his cast of mind , entirely natural to mine . I was prepared to go to lengths . I guess I overdid it . My sense of limit in these things was shot . I got a job reporting . Then we left each other . Here I am . In the first year , the Standard sent me to those poor sensational families , until they had become so commonplace they were no longer news but subject for political reflection by our feature writers . Anyway , there was the Movement in the South . Then , there were demonstrations against so many things . I went to a meeting of black school principals in Anacostia , Washington , D.C. I went as a reporter and Consultant . A consultant . By that time , any journalist who had stuck a while with unsensational blacks was accepted as of their number in that way . At lunch the first day in the cafeteria of the University of Maryland , where the conference was , a one-armed black teacher asked me to cut his meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which interferes no end with taking notes ) . I tried to cut his ham steak . I was shaking quite a lot . I think he thought it was because of his lost arm . He said , " Sweetheart , you need a drink . " That part of Maryland is dry . He offered me the key to his room , in which he had a fifth ofp47bourbon . The number on his room key was the same as mine . It turned out that by some bureaucratic mix-up at least four people had the same single-room assignment  --  two ministers , the teacher , and I. We all found rooms elsewhere . I called old friends in Bethesda . When the meetings were over , around midnight , there were of course no cabs . A small , kind black Anacostia parent , owner of a funeral parlor , offered to drive me to Bethesda  --  whichhe graciously said was only twenty minutes out of his own way home . Two hours later , we were still driving . I thought he was lost . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the side of the highway . I thought , Good grief , I am over twenty . I am a liberal . I should have thought it through . But does it need to be right here beside four lanes of nighttime traffic ? A white state trooper had pulled up behind us . The Anacostia parent turned off the ignition . " We 've done something wrong , I guess , " he said . I thought , But we have n't . The trooper shined his flashlight through the windshield . He said , " Folks , you made a wrong turn at that last turnoff . Lots of people miss it . " We drove on to Bethesda . The Anacostia parent had been truly lost . In his small , airless apartment the sportswriter served localwine , cheap Scotch , and beer . His wife , and the other sportswriters ' wives , four of them pregnant , two not apparentlyso , sat in the bedroom , drinking the Almaden , with ice . They discussed rents . The sportswriters , hitting the Scotch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books they planned to write but never would . The pressures were wrong . There was just enough money and not enough time . No one was rich . No one was poor . No one was ever going to do anything of any consequence . We were talking about No , No , Nanette . I said I thought there was such a thing as an Angry Bravo  --  that those audiences who stand , and cheer , and roar , and seem altogether beside themselves at what they wouldp48instantly agree is at best an unimportant thing , are not really cheering No , No , Nanette . They are booing Hair . Or whateverelse it is on stage that they hate and that seems to triumph . So they stand and roar . Every bravo is not so much a Yes to the frail occasion they have come to make a stand at , as a No , goddam it to everything else , a bravo of rage . And with that , they become , for what it 's worth , a constituencythat is political . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , they want , they want to be reckoned with . Joe said , Is n't it possible they just want to say that they are having a good time ? It 's possible ; one ought perhaps to take into account that it is fun to be part of an audience that wants to roar . Norma asked whether Joe had seen it . He said no . Norma said , " Well , then you do n't know . It 's not a musical audience roar . It 's not an avant garde roar . It 's a march roar . A rally roar . A parade roar . " Joe said , " You mean a lynch roar . " Norma said , " Now that 's going too far . " Just two nights ago , I went to a party with three large dinner tables . It was mixed , the rich and famous and the reporters who had helped them on their way . There were some intellectual sharks , some arrivistes , some sheep , good souls , professors , editors , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visiting Englishmento dinner , which is served by maids . This party was given by two kind , intelligent Americans I knew from college . They wanted to do good and to know , like people out of E. M. Forster or Henry James . The purpose was for the senior senator of an American liberal state and an Indian dignitary , a woman , to meet a cross section of American opinion . They met it . The first course was aspic . The dignitarythought somebody was going to attack her for Indian educational policies in Kerala . No one knew anything about India at all . She relaxed and grew bored . The senator thought he was going to meet the young and learn about them . I was sitting next to him . I said I thought he and I might be among the last three people in the room who still believed in thep49electoral process . He said , " Thanks , sweetheart . " Suddenly , after dessert , a lady at my table  --  a donor to controversial social causes , now half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art  --  said she thought the dinnerwould be wasted if the conversation did not become general , if it was all private bon mots spliced together , or just gossip . She thought we ought to talk about America today . She called first on one of those social academics , a man who had vecu a bit , whose bow tie was perpetually atilt , perhaps to show himself at an eccentric angle to the dinner jackets that he wore , what they implied . He rose , red-faced and angry , to his feet . He said he felt this country now was the world 's most murderous and corrupt . He happened to know , he said , of two deaths at Kent State that had not been reported , and of other grave matters he was not at liberty to disclose . He felt the only hope for humanity now lay in the vitality and idealism of the third world . The lady who led the discussion , unperturbed , asked a tireless , self-effacing worker in the cause of civil rights whether he had anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head against the wall , then stood up . " Bertram , " he said , " I am so offended by what you have just said , I do n't know what to say to you . " He sat down . The lady called upon a poet , a surrealist who , with clear reluctance , got to his feet and said , turning to the Indian lady , " I think in this country we need to disburden ourselves of our , our burden of rationality . " He sat down . It did not seem exactly India 's problem . A liberal reporter of military affairs was called on . He said he did n't want to discuss the morality of it , but that anyone who had covered the military would know . . . ; " I know something about the military , " another reporter , younger , fiercer , gray with anger , said , rising to his feet and interrupting . Then he said he knew that the fabric of our whole society was stretching very thin . The editors  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were called on , discursive , rambling . It was as though they had a repressed and abiding wish to have their say , in their own words for once.  |p50The  party ended the only way it could . A McLuhanite apostle , revered as a physics genius in these circles , spoke . He was in his seventies , extremely hard of hearing . He spoke long and loudly . He continued speaking . " I 'm sorry to have to interrupt , " the lady moderator said , after geologic time spans passed . He did not hear her . He went on . " I 'm very sorry to have to interrupt , " she said , more loudly . He heard nothing . He continued speaking . She kept trying . Finally , some clear-sighted soul rose to propose a toast . " All stand , " he said . Everyone stood . For a few momentsthe clear-sighted soul and the deaf genius were speaking in duet . Then the genius , looking around , subsided . " The reason we are gathered here is to honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained his glass . So did we all , and then went home with all deliberate speed . I took a cab home . The driver ranted . We passed three men , two beating up a third . They had pulled his sweatshirt up over his eyes . He could not see them . A crowd had gathered , interested . Suddenly a young man got out of the cab beside mine . " That 's enough ! " he shouted . The scene froze a minute . Then it started up again . After all , he was unarmed ; nobody knew him . He moved closer . He said , " That 's enough , " again . The whole thing stopped , dissolved . The beaten man pulled his sweatshirtdown over his injured face , put his arms inside the sleeves , and limped away . The crowd disintegrated . I thought , What a phrase from some past time I can remember . That 's enough . In the South , in simpler days , I remember a middle-aged gentle black worker speaking to his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " just tell yourself the story of your life .

All dead . No survivors . And then I would say , and then I would say , Let 's just have it a little quiet around here.  |p51The  camel , I had noticed , was passing , with great difficulty , through the eye of the needle . The Apollo flight , the fourminutemile , Venus in Scorpio , human records on land and at sea  --  these had been events of enormous importance .

On our floor of this brownstone , we are friends . Our landlord , Roger Somerset , was murdered last July . He was a kind and absent-minded man , and on the night when he was stabbed there was a sort of requiem for him in the heating system . There is a lot of music in this building anyway .

The girl on the fourth floor , who has been pining for two months , plays Judy Collins ' " Maid of Constant Sorrow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . The ground floor is a shop . The owner of the shop speaks of our landlord 's murder still . Shaking his head , he says that he suspects " foul play . " We all agree with him . Wep53changed our locks . But " foul play " seems a weird expression for the case . It is all weird . I am not always well . One block away ( I often think of this ) , there was ten months ago an immense crash . Water mains broke . There were small rivers in the streets . In a great skyscraper that was being built , something had failed . The newspapers reported the next day that by some miracle only two people had been " slightly injured " by ten tons of falling steel . The steel fell from the eighteenth floor . The question that preoccupies me now is how , under the circumstances , slight injuries could occur . Perhaps the two people were grazed in passing by . Perhaps some fragments of the sidewalk ricocheted . I knew a deliverer of flowerswho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying suicide . Situations simply do not yield to the most likely structures of the mind . A " self-addressed envelope , " if you are inclined to brood , raises deep questions of identity . Such an envelope , immutably itself , is always precisely where it belongs .

When we reached my address , I did not tip him . Racism and prudishness , I thought , and reading over people 's shoulders . But there are moments in this place when everything becomes a show of force . He can read what he likes at home . Tipping is still my option . Another newspaper event , in our brownstone .

One simply can not bear down so hard on all these choices . What is the point . That is what must be borne in mind . Sometimes the point is really who wants what .

But if you are , for any length of time , custodian of the point  --  in art , in court , in politics , in lives , in rooms  --  it turns out there are rear-guard actions everywhere . To see a thing clearly , and when your vision of it dims , or when it goesp56to someone else , if you have a gentle nature , keep your silence , that is lovely . Otherwise , now and then , a small foray is worthwhile . Just so that being always , complacently , thoroughly wrong does not become the safest position of them all . The point has never quite been entrusted to me . My cousin , who was born on February 29th , became a veterinarian . Some years ago , when he was twenty-eight ( seven , by our childhood birthday count ) , he was drafted , and sent to Malaysia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the zoo . He operated on one tiger , which , in the course of abdominal surgery , began to wake up and wag its tail . The anesthetist grabbed the tail , and injected more sodium pentothal . That tiger survived . But two flamingos , sent by the city of Miami to Kuala Lumpur as a token of good will , could not bear the trip or the climate and , in spite of my cousin 's efforts , died . There was also a cobra  --  the largest anyone in Kuala Lumpur could remember having seen . An old man had brought it , in an immense sack , from somewhere in the countryside . The zoo director called my cousin at once , around dinnertime , to say that an unprecedentedcobra had arrived . Something quite drastic , however , seemed wrong with its neck . My cousin , whom I have always admired  --  for his leap-year birthday , for his pilot 's license , for his presence of mind  --  said that he would certainly examinethe cobra in the morning but that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night 's rest .

I know an Israeli general who , in 1967 , retook the Mitla Pass but who , since his mandatory retirement from military service at fifty-five , has been trying to repopulate the Ark . He asked me , over breakfast at the Drake , whether I knew any owners of oryxes . Most of the vegetarian species he has collected have already multiplied enough , since he has found andp57cared for them , to be permitted to run wild . The carnivorous animals , though , must still be kept behind barbed wire  --  to keep them from stalking the rarer vegetarians .

John and I are breaking up . " The invitation was not of a kind that I had heard before . Aldo , who lives with me between the times when he prefers to be alone , refused to come . He despises brunch . He detests Inez . I went , instead , with an editor who has been a distant , steady friend but who , ten years ago , when we first came to New York , had once put three condoms on the night table beside the phone . We both had strange ideas then about New York . Aldo is a gentle , orderly , soft-spoken man , slow to conclude .

He felt it was a symptom of some kind  --  one of those cases where incompetence at every stage , across the board , acquired a certain independent force .

The owner of a hardware store , whose property adjoined an insured factory at the time , lost everything . Afterward , he walked all day along the railroad track , waiting for a train to run him down . Railroad service has never been very good up there . No trains came . His children own the town these days , for what it 's worth . The two cobbled streets where black people always lived have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood that occurred some years ago . Unprecedented rains came . Retailers had to destroy their sodden products , for fear of contamination . The black section was torn up and seeded over in the town 's rezoning project . No one knows where the blacks live now . But there are Negroes in the stores and schools , and on the football team . It is assumed that the park integrated the town . Those black families must be living somewhere . It is a mystery . At the women 's college where I went , we had distinguishedfaculty in everything , digs at Nuoro and Mycenae . We had a quality of obsession in our studies . For professors who had quarrelled with their wives at breakfast , those years of bright-eyed young women , never getting any older , mustp59have been a trial . The head of the history department once sneezed into his best student 's honors thesis . He slammed it shut . It was ultimately published . When I was there , a girl called Cindy Melchior was immensely fat . She wore silk trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom , she laid aside her knitting and lumbered to the window , which she opened . Then she lumbered back . " Do you think , " the professor asked , " you are so graceful ? " He somehowmeant it kindly . Cindy wept . That year , Cindy 's brother Melvin phoned me . " I would have called you sooner , " he said , " but I had the most terrible eczema . " All the service staff on campus in those days were black . Many of them were followers of Father Divine . They took new names in the church . I remember the year when a maid called Serious Heartbreak married a janitor called Universal Dictionary . At a meeting of the faculty last fall , the college president , who is new and male , spoke of raising money . A female professor of Greek was knitting  --  and working on Linear B , with an abacus before her . In our time , there was a vogue for madrigals . Some of us listened , constantly , to a single record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A professorof symbolic logic , a French Canadian , had sounds that matched but a meaning that seemed unlikely : Sheep are no angels ; come upstairs . A countertenor explained it , after a local concert : She 'd for no angel 's comfort stay . Correct , but not so likely either . Paul : " Two diamonds . " Inez : " Two hearts . " Mary : " Three clubs . " John : " Four kings . " Inez : " Darling , you know you ca n't just bid four kings . " John : " I do n't see why . I might have been bluffing . " Inez : " No , darling . That 's poker . This is bridge . And evenin poker you ca n't just bid four kings . " John : " No . Well , I guess we 'd better deal another hand . "  |p60The  host , for some reason , was taking Instamatic pictures of his guests . It was not clear whether he was doing this in order to be able to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering in his house . Or whether he thought of pictures in some voodoo sense . Or whether he found it difficult to talk . Or whether he was bored . Two underground celebrities  --  one of whom had become a sensation by never generating or exhibiting a flicker of interest in anything , the other of whom was known mainly for hanging around the first  --  were taking pictures too . I was there with an actor I 've known for years . He had already been received in an enormousembrace by an Eastern European poet , whose hair was cut too short but who was neither as awkwardly spontaneous nor as drunk as he cared to seem . The party was in honor of the poet , who celebrated the occasion by insulting everyoneand being fawned upon , by distinguished and undistinguishedwriters alike . " This group looks as though someone had torn up a few guest lists and floated the pieces on the air , " the actor said . The friend of the underground sensation walked up to us and said hello . Then , in a verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actor said a few calming things that did n't work . He finally put his finger on the mutterer 's lips . The mutterer bit that finger extremely hard , and walked away . The actor wrapped his finger in a paper napkin , and got himself another drink . We stayed till twelve . When I worked , for a time , in the infirmary of a branch of an upstate university , it was becoming more difficult with each passing semester , except in the most severe cases , to determine which students had mental or medical problems . At the clinic , young men with straggly beards and stained bluejeans wept alongside girls in jeans and frayed sweaters  --  all being fitted with contact lenses , over which they then wore granny glasses . There was no demand for prescription granny glasses at all . For the severely depressed , the paranoids , and the hallucinators , our young psychiatrists pre/scribed " mood elevators , " pills that were neither uppers nor downers but which affected the bloodstream in such a way that within three to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints and historical figures becameagain Midwestern graduate students under tolerable stress . On one , not unusual , morning , the clinic had a call from an instructor in political science . " I am in the dean 's office , " he said . " My health is quite perfect . They want me to have a checkup . " " Oh ? " said the doctor on duty . " Perhaps you could come in on Friday . " " The problem is , " the voice on the phone said , " I have always thought myself , and been thought by others , a Negro . Now , through research , I have found that my family on both sides have always been white . " " Oh , " the doctor on duty said . " Perhaps you could just take a cab and come over . " Within twenty minutes , the political-science instructor appeared at the clinic . He was black . The doctor said nothing , and began a physical examination . By the time his blood pressure was taken , the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal . The mood elevators restored him . He and the doctor became close friends besides . A few months later , the instructor took a job with the government in Washington . Two weeks after that , he was calling the clinic again . " I have found new documentation , " he said . " All eight of my great-grandparents were pure-blooded Germans  --  seven from Prussia , one from Alsace . I thought I should tell you , dear friend . " The doctor suggested he come for the weekend . By Sunday afternoon , a higher dose of the pill had had its effect . The problem has not since recurred . The Maid of Constant Sorrow said our landlord 's murder marked a turning point in her analysis . " I do n't feel guilty . I feel hated , " she said . It is true , for a time , we all wanted to feel somehow part  --  if only because violence offset thep62ineluctable in our lives . My grandfather said that some peoplehave such extreme insomnia that they look at their watches every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be feeling for themselves . Aldo says he does not care what my grandfather said . My grandmother refused to concedethat any member of the family died of natural causes . An uncle 's cancer in middle age occurred because all the suitcases fell off the luggage rack onto him when he was in his teens , and so forth . Death was an acquired characteristic . My grandmother , too , used to put other people 's ailments into the diminutive : strokelets were what her friends had . Aldo said he was bored to tearsies by my grandmother 's diminutives . The weather last Friday was terrible . The flight to Martha'sVineyard was " decisional . " " What does decisional ' mean ? " a small boy asked . " It means we might have to land in Hyannis , " his mother said . It is hard to understand how anyone learns anything . Scattered through the two cars of the Brewster  --  New York train last week were adults with what seemed to be a clandestineunderstanding . They did not look at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um , " sang a lady at our fourth stop on the way to Grand Central . She appeared to be reading the paper . She kept singing her " Um , " as one who is getting the pitch . A young man had already been whistling " Frere Jacques " for three stops . When the " Urn " lady found her pitch and began to sing the national anthem , he looked at her with rage . The conductor passed through , punching tickets in his usual fashion , not in the aisle but directly over people 's laps . Every single passenger was obliged to flick the tiny punched part of the ticket from his lap onto the floor . Conductors have this process as their own little show of force . The whistler and the singer were in a dead heat when we reached the city . The people with the clandestine understandingturned out to be inmates from somewhere upstate ,  |p63now  on leave with their families , who met them in New York . I do n't think much of writers in whom nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too literal-minded about this question . In a magazine , under the heading " $3,000 for FirstPersonArticles , " for example : " An article for this series must be a true , hitherto unpublished narrative of an unusual personal experience . It may be dramatic , inspirational , or humorous , but it must have , in the opinion of the editors , a quality of narrative interest comparable to How I Lost My Eye ' ( June ' 72 ) and Attacked by a Killer Shark ' ( April ' 72 ) . Contributions must be typewritten , preferably doublespaced . . . " I particularly like where the stress , the italics , goes . When the nanny drowned in the swimming pool , the parentsreacted sensibly . They had not been there for the event . They had left the nanny at poolside with their youngest child , a girl of five , and the neighbor 's twins , a boy and a girl of five , and the neighbor 's baby-sitter , an au pair , who had become the nanny 's dearest friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found a fire truck in the yard , the drowned body of the nanny on the tiles , the three children playing , apparently calmly , under a tree , and two disconsolate firemen trying to deal with the neighbor 's babysitter , who was hysterical . As an ambulance pulled into the driveway , the mother was already telephoning a doctor ; her husband was giving the baby-sitter a glass of water and a sedative . When her hysterics had subsided , the baby-sitter explained what she could . Neither she nor the nanny , it turned out , could really swim . They could both manage a few strokes of the breaststroke , but they had a great fear of water over their heads . All three of what she called the " little ones " were strong and intrepid dog-paddlers . She and the nanny had always confined themselves to admonitions , and their own few stroking motions , from the shallow end . It was onp64account of these stroking motions that their inability really to swim had never come to anyone 's attention or , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nanny had , unaccountably , stroked a few feet out of her depth , in the direction of her charge . Then , according to the baby-sitter , who may have confused the sequence , things happened very rapidly , in the following order . Nanny 's face turned blue . Then she swallowed water . Coughing and struggling , she reached her charge and clung to her . They both went under . Long seconds later , the little girl came up , crying and sputtering . In clear view , a few feet beyond the shallow end and beyond the grasp of the baby-sitter , who was trying to maintain her feet and her depth as she held out her hands , the nanny surfaced briefly once more , sank , and drowned . I once met a polo-playing Argentine existential psychiatrist , who had lived for months in a London commune . He said that on days when the ordinary neurotics in the commune were getting on each other 's nerves the few psychopaths and schizophrenics in their midst retired to their rooms and went their version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , the psychopaths calmed down , tried to make contact , cooked . It was , he said , as though the sun came out for them . I hope that 's true . Although altogether too much of life is mood . Aldo has a married friend who was in love for years with someone , also married . Her husband found out . He insisted that there be no more calls or letters . Aldo 's friend called several times , reaching the husband . The girl herselfwould never answer . In the end , Aldo 's friend  --  in what we regard as not his noblest gesture  --  sent all the girl 's letters , addressed in a packet , to her husband . There was nothing more . I wonder whether the husband read those letters . If he did , I suppose he may have been a writer . In some sense . If not , he was a gentleman . There are also , on the bus , quite often ritual dancers , near-spasticswho release the strap and begin a weird sequence ofp65movements , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when everyone I see is lunatic . I love the laconic . Clearly , I am not of their number . When animated conversations are going on , even with people interruptingone another , I have to curb an impulse to field every remark , by everybody , as though it were addressed to me . I have noticed this impulse in other people . It electrifies the room . It is resolved , sometimes , by conversations in a foreign language . One thinks , it is my turn to try to say something , to make an effort . One polishes a case , a tense , a comment . The subject passes . Just as well . There are , however , people who just sit there , silent . A question is addressed to them . They do not answer . Another question . Silence . It is a position of great power . Talkative people running toward those silences are jarred , time after time , by a straight arm rebuff . A quizzical look , a beautiful face perhaps , but silence . Everyoneis exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the need for aspirin . It has been that stubborn wall . I receive communications almost every day from an institutioncalled the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena . Reportingsources all over the world , and an extensive correspondence . Under the title " Type of Event : Biological , " I have received postcards about the progress of the Dormouse Invasion of Formentera : " Apart from population density , the dormouse of Formentera had a peak of reproduction in 1970 . All females checked were pregnant , and perhaps this fact could have been the source of the idea of an invasion . ' " And the Northwest Atlantic Puffin Decline . I have followed the Tanzanian Army Worm Outbreak . The San Fernando Earthquake . The Green Pond Fish Kill ( " Eighty percent of the numbers involved , " the Center 's postcard reports , " were mummichogs . " ) The Samar Spontaneous Oil Burn . The HawaiianMonk Seal Disappearance . And also , the Naini Tal Sudden Sky Brightening.  |p66Those  are accounts of things that did not last long , but if you become famous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is certain you will recur , enlarged . Of the eighteen men who were indicted for conspiracy to murder Schwerner , Goodman , and Chaney , seven were convicted by a Mississippi jury  --  a surprising thing . But then a year later , a man was wounded and a woman killed in a shootout while trying to bomb the house of some Mississippi Jews . It turned out that the informer , the man who had helped the bombers , and led the F.B.I . to them , was one of the convicted seven  --  the one , in fact , who was alleged to have killed two of the three boys who were found in that Mississippi dam . And what 's more , and what 's more , the convicted conspirator , alleged double killer , was paid thirty-six thousand dollars by the F.B.I . for bringing the bombers in . Yet the wave of anti-Semitic bombings in Mississippi stopped after the shootout . I do n't know what it means . I am in this brownstone . Last year , Aldo moved out and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask whether I could come . He said , " Are you going to stay this time ? " I said I was n't sure . I flew out quite early in the morning . On the plane , there was the most banal , unendurable pickup , lasting the whole flight . A young man and a young woman  --  he was Italian , I think ; she was German  --  had just met , and settled on French as their common language . They asked each other where they were from , and where they were going . They posed each other riddles . He took out a pencil and paper and sketched her portrait . She giggled . He asked her whether she had ever considered a career as a model . She said she had considered it , but she feared that all men in the field were after the same thing . He agreed . He began to tell off-color stories . She laughed and reproached him . It was like that . I wondered whether these things were always , to captive eavesdroppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he met me with a smile that seemed surprised , a little sheepish . We talkedp67awhile . Sometimes he took , sometimes I held , my suitcase . I tried , I thought , a joke . I asked whether there was already a girl there . He said there was . He met me in an hour at the corner drugstore for a cup of coffee . We talked . We returned to the apartment . We had Scotch . That afternoon , quite late , I flew home . I called him from time to time . He had his telephone removed a few days later . Now , for a while , he 's here again . He 's doing a political essay . It begins , " Some things can not be said too often , and some can . " That 's all he 's got so far . We had people in for drinks one night last week . The cork in the wine bottle broke . Somebody pounded it into the bottle with a chisel and a hammer . We went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have for bars they frequent . A single-story drunk told his single story . A fine musician who was with us played Mozart , Chopin , and Beethovenon the piano . It seemed a great , impromptu occasion . Then he said , we thought , " I am now going to play some Yatz . " From what he played , it turned out he meant jazz . He played it badly . We had driven in from another weekend in the country while it was still daylight . Lots of cars had their headlights on . We were n't sure whether it was for or against peace , or just for highway safety . Milly , a secretary in a brokerage office , was married in our ground-floor shop that evening . She cried hysterically . Her mother and several people from her home town and John , whose girl she had been before he married Inez , thought it was from sentiment or shyness , or for some conventional reason . Milly explained it to Aldo later . She and her husband had really married two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chapel in Las Vegas . They had n't wanted to tell their parents , or anybody , until he finished college . They had torn up their Las Vegas license . She had been crying out of some legal fear of being married twice , it turned out . Their best man , a Puerto Rican doctor ,  |p68said  his aunt had been mugged in a cemetery in San Juan by a man on horseback . She thought it was her husband , returned from the dead . She had required sedation . We laughed . My friend across the hall , who owns the beagle , looked very sad all evening . He said , abruptly , that he was cracking up , and no one would believe him . There were sirens in the street . Inez said she knew exactly what he meant : she was cracking up also . Her escort , a pale Italian jeweler , said , " I too . I too have it . The most terrible anguishes , anguishes all in the night . " Inez said she knew the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at first as a phony , " she said , " but then , when you 're with him , you find yourself naturally screaming . It 's such a relief . And he teaches you how you can practice at home . " Milly said she was not much of a screamer  --  had never , in fact , screamed in her life . " High time you did , then , " Inez said . Our sportswriter said he had recently met a girl whose problem was stealing all the suede garments of house guests , and another , in her thirties , who cried all the time because she had not been accepted at Smith . We heard many more sirens in the streets . We all went home . At 4 A.M. , the phone rang about fifty times . I did not answer it . Aldo suggested that we remove it . I took three Valium . The whole night was sirens , then silence . The phone rang again . It is still ringing . The paper goes to press tomorrow . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things point in one direction . But too strong a case , I find , is often lost . It incurs doubts , suspicions . Perhaps I do not know . Perhaps it does n't matter . I think it does , though . When I wonder what it is that we are doing  --  in this brownstone , on this block , with this paper  --  the truth is probably that we are fighting for our lives.  | " You call that ninety degrees ? " he said . It was one of the many unanswerable things he used to say . I had n't really called it ninety degrees . He had asked me to fly a ninetydegreeturn . I had turned ninety-four . " Watch it . Watch it . Watch it , " he said . Silence . One knows instantly , or not at all , what Watch it is a warning of . More silence . Turns . Suddenly , he grasped my wrist . I jumped . " Christ ! " he shouted . " I been telling you to relax . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vietnam , two wives , three secretaries , a schoolboy , a Jesuit priest , and me . On clear days , the traffic over our small field is dense . Some of the veterans , who want to be professional pilots of all sorts , fly helicopters here . Planes are lined up inp70the sky to land , on the runway to take off . Bush pilots settle in the hills , and seaplanes on the pond . All around , helicopterskeep leaping up and down . Now and then , one hears , from nowhere visible , a quavering voice . " Penrose , " it says by radio , " this is Six Two Uniform . Can you help me out . I 'm lost . " The tower is calm . " Any familiar landmarks , Six Two Uniform ? " Sorry . No . The tower asks for a description of any highways the lost pilot sees below ; then , gradually , brings him in . I had not expected lost pilots to be a frequent problem in the air . I wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had ever feared and then refused to land . " Oh , sometimes they hesitate so long we think we 're going to have to shoot them down , " the instructor said . " But they run out of gas . " The instructor is irritable , nearly always . He has taught pilots in World War II and the Korean War . He considers it part of his professional manner now to bark . A natural fighter pilot can solo after his first eight hours of instruction ; after flying solo for another eight , he can just plain fly . All of us would be washouts as fighter pilots , certainly . The Jesuit , who , like the instructor , studies Chinese cooking in his spare time , tried to endear himself to the instructor with the present of a wok . The instructor was briefly pleased , but his bad temper , on the whole , is incorruptible . Not since the worst , dread days of school have I heard this electric alternationof instructions to Watch it , Watch out , Pay attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing , Hold it , Quit trying too hard , and , of course , Relax . I fly solo these days , mostly in Three Nine Tango . I take off , turn left , turn left , turn left a third and fourth time , land , speed down the runway , take off , four lefts , land again , take off . That 's what we all do ; it 's called touch-and-go . The reason , though , that I never practice any other thing is this : I land funny . Not roughly or dangerously , just a bit canted or askew . I am also really scared of crosswind gusts . " You do n't have to arrive , " the instructor said , bitterly , when I must have seemed to him to concentrate too gravely , on ap71windy day . " You 're just supposed to land . " Back in the early days , when we would practice stalls and spins , I nearly did give up . To stall , you deliberately climb too sharply , until you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a stall . It is time to push the nose down and the throttle fully up . This process violates every natural instinct . R. D. Laing aside , it seems to be the only way to level off . Since it seems so wrong to drop a plane 's nose and accelerate , when the horizon has already vanished underneath the wings and the whole machine is clearly under strain , I used to dive a bit too soon , to get it over with . " You . Did n't . Feel . No . Stall , " the instructor would say , with enraged precision , as though he were about to leave and slam the door . Except that in a dive at a thousand feet , of course , he ca n't . " That red light was on there , " I said , pointing to a small light , which was still blinking on the panel . " It says Stall . " A long silence . " Nobody . Told . You . To . Look . At . Any . Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear as it was why I am in this flight school . Driving from the city to green places , it is acknowledged , takes too long . Flying is faster . Jim , who would be a less unlikely pilot than I am , says he has n't got enough certain free hours to take it up again . There is also in my mind the memory of a poem the Speech Arts coach recited , with great feeling and the purest diction , to our high school elocution class . " Oh , I have slipped the surly bonds of earth/ And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings/ And done a hundred things/ You have not dreamed of. / Wheeled and soared and swung/ Up , up the long , delirious burning blue , " and so on . " Put out my hand and touched , " the last line ended , " the face of God . " Well . It was n't Wallace Stevens . But at " touched , " each time , the Speech Arts coach 's voice broke . The poem had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II . He crashed , unfortunately . Tino Bellardinelli , our All-State running back , was unmoved by this poem ; he implacably chewed his toothpick . But anotherpoem got to him . " There is something in the autumnp72that is native to my blood , / Touch of manner , hint of mood ; / And my heart is like a rhyme , / With the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time. / The scarlet of the maples can shake me like a cry/ Of bugles going by. / And my lonely spirit thrills/ To see the frosty asters , like a smoke upon the hills , " and so on . And Agnes Betty Cotts , who had gone through the first eleven years of her schooling in some twilight of sexuality and inattention , became lofty , intellectual , and fierce with this : " So live , that when thy summons comes to join/ The innumerable caravan which moves/ To that mysterious realm , where each shall take/ His chamber in the silent halls of death , / Thou go not , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , sustained and soothed/ By an unfaltering trust , approach thy grave/ Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch/ About him , " etc . The Speech Arts coach worked with such diligence and faith on thirty juniors ( who had before been known to mutter , derisively , " The Brain , " when anyone so much as spoke distinctly in their midst ) that all of them subsequently went to college , each with an awful favorite poem in his heart . All of us , too , stared into a profound distance and , for years , dwelled upon this problem : " For if a man should dream of heaven and , waking , find in his hand a flower as a token that he had really been there , what then ? What then ? " Well , I do n't know what then . Every autumn , presumably , the scarlet of the maples still thrills Congressman Tino Bellardinelli'slonely spirit like a cry/ Of bugles going by . When Agnes Betty Cotts ' summons comes to join/ The innumerablecaravan which moves/ To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun and president of a Catholic women 's college . I work here at the newspaper . Sooner or later , though , I guess I was bound to slip the surly bonds of earth/ And dance the skies on the laughter-silvered winds of Six Two Uniform or Three Nine Tango . " Take off everything except your slip , " the nurse said . " Doctor will be with you in a moment .

Only connect . " Stop . Stop . Stop . Stop , " the moderator of the talk show said . They had been taping a panel . The Indo-Chinese lesbian restaurant owner , who was holding her fish-sauces cookbook , resumed a dignified , offended silence .

" Exactement what you mean , Emile , " she added , pattingthe Frenchman 's arm . The rock musician , however , spoke at the same moment . " Tu parles , " he said , amiably . It was his favorite ( in fact , his only ) French expression . For Italians , he had " Ecco " and " S'immagini ; " for Germans , " Sowas " and " Unglaublich . " He had travelled widely .

Seven years ago , an obscure Southern writer by the critic 's own name had been chosen for an international colloquium on modern humor , which was held in Seoul , Korea . It had not been widely covered in the press . Certainly there had been an error . Certainly the invitation had gone to the wrong  --  the obscure and unintended  --  Herbert Course . No publication , however , had called attention to the matter . In thep74critic 's mind , the outrage had assumed immense proportions , as a parable of the monstrous in contemporary life . His divorce , his conversion to the politics and the literature of alienation had been but one result . " Of course , you have right , " said the Frenchman , in serenemisunderstanding .

Jim , who is a lawyer from Atlanta , has been running the campaign . My normal job is reporting and reviewing at the paper . By mistake , these past few months , I also teach . Normally , left to myself , I am not inclined to work much . To the contrary . " To the contrary " is what the head of the mine workers ' union said when he was asked whether he had ordered the murder of a rival and his family .

It rains judiciously and seriously , with care , and honor , and dignity , in full awarenessof the public trust .

The union helps us with our forms , our insurance and pension plans , tenure , strike threats , and salaries , of course . The fact that the universityis unionized at all , from janitors to deans , means that we have in many ways the worst of the civil service and of academe : a vast paper-riffling ivory tower in a cast-iron unionshop . We are , in fact , a scandal citywide . Our faculty , liberal on most issues far away , sleeps well on this . Politicians tend to say the issue " does not sing . " Our full professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , never . Young instructors , hoping for tenure here , are scheduled to teach days and nights . The idea is that as long as an instructor is required to be in a classroom every hour , he will not have the time to write or publish anything . Not having published , he will never earn his tenure . Under this system , instructors tend to get hepatitis and become demoralized , but , thanks to the union , they are highly paid . And so they stay . I see Edith , Max , Franz , and Miss Fiotti every week or so . I 've taught courses for two semesters here , as Ms. Associate Professor Fain . I thought I missed the academic world , the books , the hours . I took the job part-time . I noticed onlyp76gradually . One evening , in a seminar , a student spoke of the required coarse they had all taken with the Recording Secretaryof Professor Klein . " The what ? " I said . " The Recording Secretary , " the brightest student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein has been , for thirty years , a book reviewerand writer of unsuccessful musicals . I do n't know what recording secretaries are . I know professors earn our professorial thirty-eight thousand a year . " Has anyone , " I asked , " ever had a course with , urn , with the , with Professor Klein himself ? " Certainly not ; even his Recording Secretary now is H.B.A. Two students within memory had , however , actually met Professor Klein ; he had approved their Prior Life Experience credits  --  for a year they had spent raking famous people 's leaves . Prior Life Experience credits , as substitutes for courses , are one of our educational anomalies . They are normally inseparable from a less innovative program known as E.I.F. The Dean , it turns out , has a great longing to know the private phone numbers of celebrities . He hires people from newspapers , the theater , movies , television to teach . In time , he mentions the importance of having students placed with people who are already E.I.F. , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often mentioned in the press . If one can just give him a few phone numbers , he will call them at home . I should have known . I did not understandfor quite a while . It was midnight in our paper 's office building . There was a Pinkerton man in the elevator . " Something wrong ? " Jim asked . " Yeah , " he said . " A girl on the fifth floor has been molestated . " On the television set , El Exigente was mouthing his " Bueno , " the natives were diving and splashing with pleasure , and Jim and I , who were never going to drink that brand of coffee , were watching the news . " His lawyer looks bored , " I said . Jim reached for his drink . " You always try to lookp77bored , " he said , " when your client is committing perjury . " A lady lifted the lid of her toilet tank and found a small yachtsman , on the deck of his boat , in the bowl . They spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apple . A lady in a crisis of choice phoned her friend from a market and settled for milk of magnesia . A hideous family pledged itself to margarine . Testimony resumed . Apparently , no good lawyer permits a client who is lying to tell a long story  --  to perjure himself in detail . The longer the story , the more true it did seem . " Well , you had a little social conversation together , did you not ? " Senator Montoya was asking . There was a short answer . " Well , did you socialize about the Watergate ? " Senator Montoya insisted , in his idiosyncratic way . " Mangia , " said the lady in the lovely spaghetti-sauce commercial . " Mangia , Bernstein . Mangia , O'Malley . Mangia , Garcia . Mangia , Jones . " " Hello , Jen ? " the voice on the phone said , at two one morning . " It 's Mel . Sorry to call you at home . " Mel is the Acting Head of our department  --  Drama and Cinema . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The PermanentHead , a flustered lady of pure steel , whose academic background consists of a Midwestern degree in Oral Science and a brief marriage to an actor , is on a city grant to study Media History abroad . " Hi , Mel , " I said to the Acting Head , as warmly as I could . " Jen , the Art Department wants to do a course in Space on Film , " he said . He paused . " We knew you 'd want to be informed . " He paused again . " And , without trying to influenceyou in any way , we 'd like to know what your position is . " I yawned . " Mel , I feel strongly about this , " I said . I had been teaching for some months . I was catching on . " I really do . " " We hoped you would , " he said . " Len has just pointed out  --  we 're having coffee here  --  that there are just two things onp78film . Time . And Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space , we'fl'have lost half ... " " Yes , " I said . " And if the History Department takes Time away ... " " Exactly . " Summer . The speedboat was serious . The young tycoon was serious about it , as he was serious about his factories , his wife , his children , his parties , his work , his art collection , his resort . The little group had just had lunch , at sea , aboard the tycoon 's larger boat , a schooner . The speedboat , designed for him the year before , had just arrived that day . The tycoon asked who would like to join him for a spin to test it . The young American wife from Malibu , who had been overexcitedabout everything since dawn , said she would adore to go . Her husband , halfway through his coffee still , declined . The young Italian couple , having a serious speedboat of their own , went to compare . In starting off , the boat seemed much like any other , only in every way  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more spare . And then , at speed , the boat , at its own angle to the sea , began to hit each wave with flat , hard , jarring thuds , like the heel of a hand against a tabletop . As it slammed along , the Italians sat , ever more low and loose , on their hard seats , while the American lady , in her eagerness , began to bounce with anticipation over every little wave . The boat scudded hard ; she exaggerated every happy bounce . Until she broke her back . She was sped to shore , of course , and then to Rome , by helicopter . Soon after that , she was well enough to fly back to New York . She recovered in Malibu . But violent things are always happening to the very rich , and to the poor , of course . Freak accidents befall the middle classes in their midst . Martin , our campaign contributor , who spent one term at Oxford many years ago , and who has sounded Englishever since , tends to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything  --  a joke , a sigh , a quarrel , an anecdote  --  has upon him , at such times , this effect . He says " How toop79like life . " When the American lady had her accident , Martin said How too like life all afternoon . The Dean of Cultural Affairs called a meeting of the representatives of our two departments on the question of jurisdictionin the Space on Film course , late one morning . Seven H.B.A.s attended this , because , not having thought or publishedanything in twenty years , and not having , like ProfessorKlein , careers near the mainstream of cultural life , they do not spend their lives entirely in idleness . They quarrel . The Dean , whose analyst is Franz , has the same girl who caused Edith to tear Max 's four-leaf clover apart . The situation is , in every way , unorthodox . Franz was once suspended for a year from his analytic institute for having twice married his patients and divorced his wives . He spent that year as a therapist for children in our Guidance School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictional disputes . Drama and Cinema grew out of a workshop that existed many years ago to remedy the accents of bright city girls , who could not afford college out of town . When such programs became unfashionable , the staff chose to become two faculties : Dramatistics , and Perspectives in Media . Within a year , the Media people chose to join the newer Department of Minority Groups and Social Change  --  which already offered History of Broadcasting 204 , 301 , and Seminar and whose course on Prostitution , Causes and Origins , was being televised . The Dramatistics people felt they could not attract students , or budget allocations , on their own . They added Film . Our department changed its name , and became what it now is . Our Drama people are trying to take over the English Department 's course Creative Writing ioi ; Playwriting A. The English Literature people are beleagueredon another side . For twenty years , they have had The Brothers Karamazov ( translated , abridged ) . The Department of Russian Literature , which teaches all its courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have designs in other fields : Ibsen andp80Strindberg , in particular  --  which seems reasonable enough , since all the texts are plays . Ibsen and Strindberg , however , belong , with Swinburne , to the Department of Germanistics and Philology . Between 1938 and 1949 , all German courses were unpopular . The German Literature people simply seized Ibsen and Strindberg  --  and by some misunderstanding , which was noticed too late , got Swinburne as well . There were no Drama people , or any other sort of people , at that time , to compete . Chekhov , meanwhile , for reasons that , I am afraid , are clear , is taught in the Classics Department ( Greek 209C ) . The operative principle appears to be that if any thing or person mentioned in another department could conceivably be mentioned in your own , you have at least an argument to seize the course . One night when the Women 's Studies Division gets under way , we all expect there 's going to be a coup . Constituency . Dennis , a rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite expressions . When he was certain of something , he said it was sure as God made little green apples . When he wanted no interference from someone , he would ask him to keep his cotton-picking hands off . When he felt superior to someone , he said he ate that sort of fella for breakfast . Since a good part of Dennis ' day consisted in being certain , deploring interference , and feeling superior , he had occasion to use all these idioms , which he thought gruffly witty , several times a day . His appointments secretary , in whom he confided his impressions , of business , his home life , his diet , had a recurrent dream that she shot him . Lewis , the barber , discouraged conversation . Over the years , by keeping his face vacant and refusing to reply even to the direct questions of his customers , he managed to imposehis own silence upon them . Florian , who worked the next chair , spoke incessantly and even sang sometimes . He flourished his towels . He gave advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairstyles of his customers . As far as anyone could remember , Lewis addressedthe subject of Florian only once . " Someday , " he said , " I 'm going to kill him . " About money . When we had come from our public schools and our private schools , and our travels abroad , and our own education to our first solid jobs in the city , one of our golden couples gave a party to raise funds . The cause was desperate and just . Five haggard members of the group whose cause it was spoke eloquently on the terrace , sang sad songs , and afterward stood among us in the living room . There were servants . There was a bartender . The first odd thing was that the cups were plastic , and the brands of Scotch , gin , bourbon , even beer , were unknown brands . We knew that charities ought not to waste money on overhead . But when the awkwardmoment of collection came , our most successful lawyer reached into his pocket and came up with change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fashion circles for her clothes , opened her purse , hesitated , and brought out a crumpled dollar bill . Checkbooks came out on every side . Checks for three dollars , two dollars , even a check for four dollars and eighty-two cents , were signed with a flourish and passed along . It became clear : nobody under forty gives anything to charity . Martin and Iris do contribute to the arts , but Martin wants to be on boards of trustees with the fathers of friends he went to Harvard with . A lot of the undertwenty-fivesgive every cent they have to weird sects they want to get their head together in . But nobody , as a matter of course , any longer tithes . The Art people , then , met our people , regarding Space . The meeting began quietly enough . " I particularly resent , " Mel said , leafing to the fourth page of a nine-page memorandumthe Art people had sent that morning , in reply to his own eleven-page memorandum of the night before , your use of the word unconscionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . " " Memoranda " in all departments of our university is singular , " memorandums " plural . " Phenomena " is another singular , taking the plurals " phenomenas " and " phenomenae . " I have also heard " phenomenums . " Usage , for those of us who went to colleges and universities of other sorts , is always odd . A change of grade , for example , after semester 's end , requires of the professor a signed slip . The professor must , without the help of Miss Fiotti from Fringe Benefits , fill in the line : Reason for Change of Grade . The Dean had such a form before him as we met . " Reason for Change of Grade , " it read . " Cleracal Error . " It was signed " Professor Leora J. Smith . " Leora is our Permanent Head . Within three wrathful hours  --  in which , at one point , our people understood the Art people to have implied our people were unqualified to teach a course our people heard as Spaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Space on Film . It will be taught jointly , by our people and their people , in a seminar next spring . It will be listed under our people in the catalogue . If anything goes wrong , the featherbedding illiterates in our department will join the reactionary pedants in theirs to blame it on Open Admissions , the program by which the university now lets all interested high school graduates in . " Open Admissions " sounds like an outdoor confessional . It is another faculty excuse for doing less and earning more . " Standards are down , " the H.B.A.s and holders of degrees in Film and Oral Science will say . " We have Open Admissions , after all . " I wo n't be here next spring . Talent was blazing through the columns and onto the coffee tables . The physical-assault metaphor had taken over the reviews . " Guts , " never much of a word outside the huntingseason , was a favorite noun in literary prose . People were said to have or to lack them , to perceive beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gut-busting " and " gut-wrenching " were accolades . " Nerve-shattering , " " eye/popping , " " bone-crunching "  --  the responsive critic was a crushed , impaled , electrocuted man . " Searing " was lukewarm . Anything merely spraining or tooth-extracting would have been only a minor masterpiece . " Literally , " in every single case , meant figuratively ; that is , not literally . This film will literally grab you by the throat . This book will literally knock you out of your chair . " Presently " always meant not soon but now . Sometimes the assault mode took the form of peremptory orders . See it . Read it . Go at once . Sometimes it sidled up disguised as musing , in unanswerable-question form . Shall I tell you how much I . . . Should I even attempt to describe ... Or , should I say unequivocally ... A favorite strategy was the paragraph-terminating : Right ? Followed immediatelyby Wrong . This linear invitation to a mugging was considered a strategy of wit . Many sentences carried with them their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The only word for it is . . . Whether it really sufficed to say , or whether there was , in fact , another word , the sentence , bowingand applauding to itself , ignored . There existed also an economical device , the inverted-comma sneer  --  the " plot , " or his " work , " or even " brave . " A word in quotation marks carried a somehow unarguable derision , like " so-called " or " alleged . " It was hard to remember yesterday 's polemic , to determine whether today 's rebuttal was , in fact , an answer to it . Recalling arguments in order genuinely to refute them was an unrewarding exercise . A lot of bread , anyway , was buttered on the side of no distinction . God was not dead , but the Muse was extremely unwell . " Mutual " meant common , shared , together , both , or simplysomehow two-ish , as in our mutual hope , our mutual burden , mutual decision , mutual interest , mutual advantage , perhaps mutual camping trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending indictment ; physical agony , in hospitals , was called discomfort , normally . " Problem " and " personal tragedy " meant crimes . " Serene " and " out of touch with reality " meant a given speaker trying to clearp84himself by intimating that the boss was crazy . " He has sufferedenough " meant if we investigate this matter any further , it will turn out our friends are in it , too . A sufficiency of suffering , in public life , consisted in a loss of face perhaps , or office , or , earlier , in getting caught , or having lived in dread of being caught , or in committing crimes , or having wanted to commit them . And if the real sufferer was the public man in violation of the criminal law , and a sufficiency of suffering lay in his various states of mind , then it was perhaps everyone else who got off too easily . When a new President brought our national nightmare to an end by askingus to " bind up the internal wounds , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people tagged up on these public codes and incantations , baby talk took over private conversation  --  naughty and cranky , in particular . Personal treachery and acts of violence were naughty . Citizens in the middle of small betrayalsor murder trials described themselves as in a cranky mood . Murders , generally , were called brutal and senseless slayings , to distinguish them from all other murders ; nouns became glued to adjectives , in series , which gave an appearance of shoring them up . The concept of the jig itself being up , however , had retreated into thrillers . Intelligent people , caught at anything , denied it . Faced with evidence of having denied it falsely , people said they had not done it and had not lied about it , and did n't remember it , but if they had done it or lied about it , they would have done it and misspoken themselves about it in an interest so much higher as to alter the nature of doing and lying altogether . It was in the interest of absolutely nobody to get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught " in the old sense on which most people could agree . Induction , detection , the very thrillers everyone was reading were obsolete . The jig was never up . In every city , at the same time , therapists earned their living by saying , " You 're too hard on yourself . "  |p85The  frail , serious four-year-old boy stood , arms outspread , at the foot of the staircase . He looked at his infant sister , who stood three steps above . " Jump , baby , " he said , gravely , encouragingly . She summoned her courage , let go of the bannister , and jumped . He caught her , but since she was quite plump , she flattened him . " Good baby , " he said , when his breath had returned . Then he went to his room , put on his pajamas , and lay down for his nap . Every day , when he got home from school , they repeated this process . It was his way of taking her education in hand . At twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the decent men in public life . When our first campaign spokesman returned from a press conference saying , " My dears , I 've never been so buffeted , " Kate left her job at the museum and took over a lot of the campaign 's hardest work . On a summer Monday , after a morning rally , Kate was walking along Forty-second Street from the subwaystation . She saw a tall , young , scholarly-looking man obviously about to say something to her . " Excuse me , " he said at last . He said he was from the Stanford **25;2531;TOOLONG . Kate said nothing . " Sidewalks , " he went on , frowning slightly . " Sidewalk contamination . " He said they were working on the right shoes of pedestrians . He wondered whether he might take a slide from hers ? Kate nodded . She felt a flash of unease the moment she leaned against a wall and raised her foot to take the shoe off . He was already on the sidewalk , quietly licking the sole . No passerby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up and walked away . Our committee , which means well but has as yet no name , no charter , and no acronym , meets every month .

At our last meeting , our distinguishedpainter , who is also rich , suggested that , for our next public symposium , we invite poets to speak , in prose , of theirp86views of the contemporary world . The painter spoke at length of the unique vision poets have of things , their lack of veniality or institutional affiliation ; their quality , in short , of divine ecstasy . " Have you known many poets , Mr. Hardemeyer ? " our distinguished historian , a lady , asked . " Stacks , " Mr. Hardemeyer replied . It had been a bad day at nursery school . One of the class 's six Kevins had been left in the Park . The children had been out there for an hour . The teacher noticed what she took to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went for the police . Kevin went to the statue of Alice and sat down . The teacher returned and put the children on the school bus . When they got back to the classroom , the teacher noticed she was one child short . Hysterical , she called the precinct and the mother . The officer on duty thought it best to have the mother wait at the station , while a patrolman and the teacher went back to the Park to look . Kevin , it turned out , had climbed down from the statue of Alice and found no one . A man , probably the original lingererin the bushes , had taken him for a walk and bought him an ice-cream cone . Kevin had not wanted an ice-cream cone especially . Having incurred enough losses in one day , he respected his obligations in the matter of adults . He returned , with his cone , to the statue , and waited to be found . The patrolman and the teacher did find Kevin . They brought him to his mother , who had behaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single child on the school bus had known that one of their Kevins was missing . They had not mentioned it to the driver , or their teacher , or each other . They took it that Kevin had been left , forever , for some reason , which would become clear to them , with patience , in the course of time . Here 's who , of course , is out there in this city : all those Kevins ( the class also includes four Wendys ) , the teacher , thep87mother , our staff at the paper , Myrnie , Lothar , the Cardinal , the committee , Lewis the barber , Mel , the unions , Bernstein , O'Malley , Garcia , Jones . Lothar was on the board of a museum , two projects in urban renewal , a television network , a public utility , a college , a film institute , and a foundation , which , after several disheartening experiences with projects that became " controversial , " confined itself to very expensive , highly critical studies of other foundations ' work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was consulted by , many politicians , whom he numbered among his closest friends . When , not infrequently , two such politicians were running against each other , Lothar was asked which one he favored . " All I can tell you , " he would say , " is that they are both among my closest friends . " If , however , there was a considerabledifference in age between two friends running for a single office , Lothar gave one to know that , consistent with his openness to ideas , he preferred the younger man . Lothar permitted  --  in fact , encouraged  --  his wife to take an interest . Myrnie liked to travel in the South . She took part in almost all of Lothar 's public-service projects . Sometimes , rarely , she had occasion to worry about Lothar 's state of mind . Lothar 's early upbringing had been religious , fundamentalist . He was high-church now , and had not been , in forty years , devout . An office building that he owned distressedhim . It was vacant . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrnie noticed that Lothar was sleeping badly . It was not so much the money . Creative problem-solving had been the pride of Lothar 's youth and middle age . There was , of course , the money question , too . Myrnie gave the matter thought . One evening when Lothar was at his health club , Myrnie invited the Cardinal for a drink . Myrnie and the Cardinal had met at board meetings of one sort or another . They had weathered scandals . They had been relieved , together , when the museum scandal was so rapidly replaced by the Equity Funding scandal , the Queens District Attorneyp88Ponzi racket scandal , the famous restaurants with sanitary violations scandal , the Boy Scouts of America local chapters padded enrollment scandal , the Biaggi testimony before the grand jury scandal , the Soap Box Derby scandal , the firemen'sunion strike-vote scandal  --  in fact , so many scandals , local , personal , and national , that it was hard to sustain attention to any single one . Myrnie was not certain , in the case of the vacant building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some idea that he might levitate the building , or dissolve the spell upon it , or simply exercise his metaphysical authority in its direction , she waited for him . The Cardinal arrived , urbane , interested , but not , thank heaven , prying . He settled easily with his bourbon . With her characteristic delicacy and frankness , Myrnie outlined the problem to him . Over his second drink , he had it solved . A syndicate , of doubtful rectitude but of unquestioned financial stability , was run by an inhabitant of the diocese , who , though he had not specifically mentionedany need for an office building , most probably had such a need . One more drink , and the Cardinal departed . One more week , and the building was bought  --  as a headquartersfor enterprises in jukebox rental , private garbage collection , and parking lots . Lewis was an excellent barber . His customers  --  Lothar , Jim , Dennis , the Dean , and the Cardinal among them  --  held him in high regard . There was also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks for five years . Last week , Lewis , having completed his haircut , removed the towel from the boy 's shoulders and said , " You know , you 'll have to pay me . " The boy stood with his hands in his pockets . " I ca n't , " he said . " Dad 's meant to pay . " " Has n't paid me in six months , " Lewis said . " He wo n't , " the boy said . " Ever since he moved out , he says it 's Mom 's business . " " Your ma will have to pay , then , " Lewis said.  | " She says , under the settlement , Dad 's got to pay . " " Please do n't come back , then , " Lewis said , " until somebodypays . " I was sitting next to the chairman of the committee , our renowned biographer . The dinner was , as it is quite often , at his club . The club is for men who have good manners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twice a year , and throughout the year in selected dining rooms , the club waives its rules and lets escorted ladies in . For two courses , the chairman had pointed out to me paintings and other objects associated with high moments in the club 's long history . By the cheese and salad , we had hit a lull . Mr. Hardemeyer , on my right , was muttering about " the wonderful insights of our African friends about nature . " On the chairman'sleft , our married nun , member of the City Council , was taking down the phone number of the black psychiatrist on her left . Conversation had lapsed  --  definitely . The chairmanand I inhaled to speak at the same moment . " You were saying ? " I said . " No , please , " he said . I asked whether women'sgroups had ever protested the exclusion of women from the club . " Ah , no , " he said . " No , no . Our wives and colleagues have their own club , do n't you see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a mistake . There just are n't so many subjects . " Well , I did n't mean your wives and colleagues so much . . . " He looked alarmed , then inspired . He offered to sponsor me for membership in his wives ' and colleagues ' club . This involved a misunderstanding so profound that it reminded me of the time when , to surprise me on a cheerful day , Jim 's brother took me , without warning , to a full performance of Parsifal . We gave the subject up . The coffee table seemed to be whale vertebrae , laminated , or enclosed in Perspex . All around the wall , there were tusks . A disagreeable cat and an old gray rag were lying on the piano . A bulldog , wrapped in a blanket , wheezed on the sofa , beside the spot where a drink had been spilled . The bachelorsp90and divorced fathers sat , with their drinks and their girls , on the floor . It was late . Now and then , someone would get up to restore circulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room . " Down , " Max would say as this creature wrapped himself around another guest . " Albert , " I said . " Down . " There would be the sound of ice in glasses , canine panting , Max and others saying " Down , " and " Shame , " and " Sit . " All the men in the room had drinks in both hands . They had tried to extricate themselves from conversations by saying , " I guess I 'll have another drink . May I get one for you ? " The trouble with this method is that it takes people right back where they came from ; it is impossible to approach with one lady 's gin and tonic another lady who may be drinking Scotch . Escape procedures , however , were in full force . Some people , in a frenzy of antipathy and boredom , were drinking themselves into extreme approximations of longing to be together . Exchanging phone numbers , demanding to have lunch , proposing to share an apartment  --  the escalations of fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult version of slapjack , a bill-payer loan from a finance company , an attempt to buy with one grand convivial debt , to be paid in future , an exit from each other 's company at that instant . The inside-dopester , having been , according to the morningpaper , wrong again , was ranting slightly . Edith , whose nine-year-old has polish on her nails and a silver electric chair on her charm bracelet , was on the floor in contortions , trying to endear herself to a child . " Warren Burger , " the baby-food tycoon was saying to the assassination theorist . " He 's no friend of the Establishment . " A young professor from Iowa , who was in the city for a lecture series on Wordsworthand the Lake Poets , spoke of his closeness to his own students , with several of whom he had had affairs , although he did not believe , in the academic context , in shacking up .

" We all watched the " Eleventh Hour News , " which went on , of course , at the Twelfth Hour . Jim and I drove out to the country . It was very late . We stopped for coffee at an allnightdairy-and-diner on the way . A man got out of a truck , came in , ordered a milkshake , put his wallet on the counter , and mumbled something . Then he left , looking angry . " He asks me for a package of rubbers , " the man behind the counter said . " I mean , this is a dairy .

As is clear from the parking regulations , however , there are situations in which you are not entitled to stop.  |p92The  driver of the island 's only taxi was a tall , thin man , with almost invisible eyes and a sparse , brown , asymmetrical mustache . He drove his rickety old car in a kind of drunken weave , from one side to the other of the road . Shrill , improbablecries of " Taxi ! Taxi ! Taxi ! " rang out from behind the rocks and hills , and from the sea . It turned out that the man was a ventriloquist . This cry of " Taxi ! " was his talent , and his only joke . He required , every few seconds , to be praised for it . " Taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donkey cart . " Taxi ! " from behind a cow . He insisted that his passengers laugh , turn around , look astounded , incredulous . He kept right on . If passengers resumed a conversation of their own , or gave any sign that their attention had lapsed ,  |p93he  would speed his car into a wilder weave , his voice into more and shriller screams . Some thought him a charming eccentric . It had never occurred to me , though , what an oddity , intellectually , ventriloquism on the radio used to be . At the end of that summer , none of us any longer spoke any known language . Sometimes , in the presence of a Spaniardwho spoke French but not English , two Americans would spend an evening talking French to him and each other . Sometimes , in the presence of an American , who naturally spoke no Portuguese , six Brazilians spent an eveningtalking Italian to him and each other , although the American did n't know Italian , either . Sometimes , by mistake , or having made a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language which was native to no one and inconvenient to everybody . We were under a strain . Once , a heavy man , with a thick accent or combination of accents , was brought by a young French actress to dinner . He was introduced as Boris . He said he was a doctor . When someone asked what sort of doctor , he said " mnnh , mnnh , an healer , " with an " h " as though someone had thrown him a medicine ball . His work , he said , made use of what he must call the most mnnh , mnnh healing words in any language . " The Lord is my shepherd , " he began . " I have not want . He teach me to lie down in the green . Vast , He leads me still to the water . He restore there my soul . Mnnh , hah , yea though . . . " he rumbled profoundly through to the end . Nobody knew quite what to say to him . Later , when I found myself sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nationality was . His answer was long and deep . I did not understand a word . I asked him what his first language had been . Another intense monologue . I did n't get it either . I tried another route . What language now , I asked , came to him most easily . " Mnnh , mnnh , ah , " he said , sipping his vodka and managing to breathe , at the same time , insinuatingly , " I speak the language of love . "  |p94The  island had no trees . Rocky and bleak , with patches of living scrub and patches of burned and blackened scrub , it floated in the ocean like a worn-out Brillo pad . There were bandits in the interior , and farms with goats that fed on the few green things in the dry dirt among the rocks . The islandersdid not care for the coast . They feared the sea . They did not fish . They could not swim . They thought of the sea as a source of malaria . Forty years ago , American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , the island fathers , distrustful for generations of the shore , always left to their sons the goat-farming interior lands , and to their daughters the unfarmable coast . The result was that , when the jet outriders came , with their boats , and their architects , and their search for an unspoiled sea , the island women began to sell their beaches and became extremely rich . They still dressed in black , and their teeth were bad . But they travelled , by plane , to the mainland from the new airport . They shopped in Ostia , Torino , and Rome . Within ten years , their sons and husbands had spent all the rest of the money , on cars , appliances , and schemes to become richer still . They were poor again . The jet outriders had , by this time , built their houses . The rest of the coastline was owned by consortiums . Hotelswere going up . The island sons and daughters now took jobs in the tourist hotels . Bandits remained active in the interior . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist party formed . The party swept through the staff of the hotels too , of course ; but hotel employees ran a risk of being fired , which was not shared by servants in the private houses . The owners spent so much of the year away . The uniformed couples in those lovely houses , then , became the party leadership . Hotel waiters , waitresses , maids , bell captains and porters , party members all , remainedwary of management , of mandarins in the front office , and above all , of the cooks . The cooks were mad , short-tempered , morose , individualistic , and elitist to the core . But , particularly in the off-season , the hotel cadresp95found it possible to come to the meetings , in the kitchens and living rooms of the absent rich , of their party cells . We did not see Boris again after the night we met him . We did not see the actress again , either . Mixed as we all were on our coast , and in our house , we began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other all the time . " Ecoute , " Marge Brown would say to her four-year-old and to her husband . " Ecoute , Bunny . Joe , please . Ecoute . " Everyone swore continuously . English was the language for that . Elio Kahn 's French was perfect , except for his accent , which was terrible . He cultivated this terribleness . It suited his humor . His precise French , pronouncedin flat-out American Southern , also gave what he said a kind of slow burning quality , as though his words had their own built-in double take . One evening , when we were on a neighbor 's terrace , one of the coast 's most beautiful young wives walked dreamily by . Marge remarked that she looked older . Joe said she looked dissolute . Even Greg , who seldom talks at all , said it seemed she 'd put a lot of mileage on . And Elio , Elio just leaned back and said , " Well , yes . She does look un peu defraichie . " Greg , who had spent the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oreia . It seemed to be an exclamation of approvalor joy . He used it incessantly , in a tone so flat , bleak and despairing that we all began to like it . Oreia , we would say , when the waiter , after four hours , brought our dinner . Oreia , when , after nine straight days , the rain stopped . Oreia , when the radio , which was dead most nights , woke up and spoke the news . We were not exactly hated on the island  --  or if we were , it was likely that everyone else was hated more . We were not exactly homeowners , not tourists , not celebrities , expatriates , or hippies , not exactly anything . We were not always there at the same time . None of us ever stayed long . We were not there out of boredom . We had all been coming there , from our separate directions , for so many years.  |p96The  first year I ever came to the island , there was no phone and no hot water . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was alone ; I had rented a house . During the month in which I had the house , the road was being moved . Electricity and telephones , it was said , could not be installed even in town until the road was done . My house , for some reason , was built straight down a hill , in a kind of shaft . One entered through the kitchen , the highest point , and then almost immediately fell down three flights of stairs . The walls on the sides of the stairs were covered with framed , glass-enclosed butterflies . Three mornings a week , a woman came to clean . What she spoke was not exactly Italian , not exactly Spanish , not exactly anything . It was local , a result of all the many invasions and immigrations the island had undergone since before the Crusades . She was squat and , normally , sullen . She wore a wide black skirt , a black blouse , sandals and woolen socks . The only sign of animation she ever gave occurred when she spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were from the interior . Darkly , she mentioned their violent , wrathful dispositions , their criminal natures , the atrocities it was their custom to commit . It was a matter of absolute necessity to them , she would assure me , a matter of absolute , hideous , interior , criminal necessity for these men to commit atrocities . For example , and here her own face would assume an almost maniacal slyness , for example , I might have heard chanting on certain mornings , at sunrise ? I might have heard it ? On such days , the men in the work crews were strangling a cat . No , she could not believe it either ; the children had seen it . Here she called Antonio , her nine-year-old . Yes , he had seen it . From their interior , criminal necessity , these men required , at dawn sometimes , to strangle cats . And so , this was her normal peroration , I should take care . That was all , that was what she would say to me : I should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had graduated from a yeshiva and from college in Queens . He was planning to become a C.P.A. Private Lehmann was the son of a famous novelist and an opera singer . He had gone to Exeter and Harvard . He wrote plays . Both men , one through his brother-in-law 's contacts with a local politician , the other through his father 's friendship with a retired army general , had managed to avoid the draft , with just four months ' active service in the National Guard . Their names had been jumped to the top of the lists at their local armories . There they were . At five o'clock on a morning in February , their third morning as Guardsmen , Privates Aufrichtigand Lehmann had been ordered to clean the barracks floors and stairs . They had already been working forty minutes , on two flights . The mops and brushes , even the soap and water , seemed , like the rest of the Guard equipment , worn and obsolete . Both men were haggard and tired . Both men were cold . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his colleague , sighed deeply , and spoke his first words of the morning . " Ach , Lehmann , " he said . Private Lehmann replied , without hesitation , " Ach , Aufrichtig . " Aufrichtig , Lehmann , all the recruits at the base had been through three weeks of their training ; they had marched , and stood guard , and cleaned up , and attacked , and marched more . They were tired and fit . They had also sat through evenings of lectures . On their third Thursday , they were lectured on venereal disease . There was a long talk by a sergeant . There were slides and a movie . The movie was harrowing in its physical detail . When the movie was over , the sergeant returned to the platform . " All right , men , " he said . " Now , Dessalines has had this thing , have n't you , Dessalines ? Dessalines , stand up . " A stocky recruit , looking foolish , stood up . " You 've had this thing , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " the recruit replied . " Sit down , " said the sergeant . Dessalines sat down . " All right , men , " the sergeant said . " Be alert . "  |p98Be  alert , near the army base ; on the island , take care . When Lehmann , Dessalines and I were still at the same public school , Miss McKenny used to conclude each year 's American History Week , in every senior class , with a discourse . It ranged in subject from the treachery of Roosevelt in getting us into that war to save his Russian friends to the sinister effects those Russians , and their colleagues , and their co-religionists , must already have upon our thoughts . And so , class , was her yearly final sentence to us , Do n't say you have not been warned . We never said it . Nobody I ever met who grew up in the fifties , Lord knows , would have said it , could properly claim on any subject whatsoever not to have been warned . The Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its mudbaths and nightlife , Baden-Baden for its hotel and waters  --  came to the clinic of Doctor SchmidtNesselout of a new conviction that the best evidence for the soundness of a cure must lie , after all , in the longevity of the man by whom it is run . Doctor Muehsam , who had died the previous summer , not of his extreme old age , but of a mysteriousfall down six flights of stairs in his clinic ( mysterious because , since the flights were separated by landings , Doctor Muehsam must have continued his fall around corners ; also , because he had left the clinic , not to his wife , who had helped him to run it , but to his directress of gymnastics , a nurse ) , had disappointed them , by dying . However , he had always looked a frail and burning man . Doctor Schmidt-Nessel , who was bearded , vigorous , and by his own account well over ninety , gave no sign of ever passing on . Schmidt-Nessel , whose waiting list was long , believed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , in serious cases , drunk at breakfast , and in all other cases , skipped around in , on the lawn . He believed also in the efficacy of chants . As a result , just before dawn each weekday morning , all patients of whatever age lined up , barefoot , in the Alpine grass , in a sort of conga-line forma/tion , and skipped together , chanting Nu Na Neu Won ( short for Nun Nahen Neue Wonnen , Now Near New Raptures ) , and Wir Stammen Von Dem Liebesquell ( We Spring From the Love Source ) to the morning sun . A young woman , whose husband had sent her to the clinic because of her asthma , began to laugh at the second chant , on her second morning . She was expelled . Laughter , however , was one of Schmidt-Nessel 's remedies ; he required only that it be in prescribed and chanted form . A schoolteacher , who had come because of her nerves , arrived a few minutes late for the Laugh Chant on her first morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Laugh Chant , and hearing a unison of derisive laughter when she came through the doorway , she took it that she was being laughed at , and went to pieces entirely . Every Tuesday night , however , Schmidt-Nessel had a specialcure for the Nervous Cases . One of his beliefs was that people in the modern world do not breathe properly ; that one of the ways to get them to breathe properly is to make them gasp ; and that one way to make them gasp is to hit them . On Tuesday nights , Schmidt-Nessel dealt with the Nervous Cases in the cellar , where he sprayed them , one by one , with a high-powered hose . The schoolteacher , who had not been told about this ritual , either , found herself , first , lined up naked in a concrete room full of naked strangers , then alone with the doctor in a small cubicle , where water slammed her against one wall and another until she began to cry hysterically . Two patients from Albuquerque , worried , sent someonedownstairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite certain that this treatment was right . Doctor Schmidt-Nessel , sitting , immense , in his black bikini , on a cinder block in the steam-filled cubicle , did not deign immediately to answer . Later , when he was dressed , he pointed out to the couple from Albuquerque that if he were a surgeon they would not presume to put to him questions of this sort . They thought it over , and set out for home the following evening . The schoolteacher pulled herself together ,  |p100|presumably  breathed deeply , and left by the same train . In the end , in Albuquerque , the schoolteacher married Harry 's and May 's oldest son . That 's Aldo 's friend and partner back in Hartford . Often , when we are not on this island , they are here . There is a difference , of course , between real sentiment and the trash of shared experience . " I remember you . In first grade , you told Miss Hennebery that Dan Frayne , the class albino , and I had been whispering during Silent Meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitionist in our local railroad station . You said he had VD , which was the day we won the war in Europe , and that my Uncle Jean , who had fought in France , would be just like him . I went away to school for some years . In 1954 , you ran over my dog . We did not meet again until after college , when we were both in love for a time with the same man at the law office where I worked . Since then , you have told any number of false and vicious stories at my expense . Now we meet again , " is not to say , " Know each other ? Gosh , we 've been close for thirty years . " So , when you find yourself sitting in a bomb shelter beside someone who refuses to share either of two blankets with a small child who is shivering ; or you find yourself standing in a living room beside someone who , seeing a sad , powerful , distinguished man , recently widowed , in animated conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband has left her , when you find yourself standing beside someone who then swoops toward the gentleman , embraces him as though he were a lover swum out to save her from a cruel drowning , and saying " Darling , I 've been so longing to talk to you , " protracts her embrace until she has removed him from the not quite homely woman , as effectively as a sheepdog might single out a sheep or a tackle might crowd a runner out of bounds at the sidelines  --  when , time and again , such a person happens to be , in fact , the same one , it is best not to think , nostalgically , " Hell , we 've been throughp101a lot together , " unless you are prepared to add , " You have caused , over the years , varieties of unhappiness for which I have not , perhaps , been sufficiently grateful . " When we were still in graduate school in England , Aldo used to read his Aristotle , for a time , before he went to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop this Aristotle on the floor . A few months later , we became friends with the downstairs tenants , also students . They spoke of the eccentricities of the previous tenant of our place . He gave enormous drunken parties . He threw watermelon rinds into the garden . Once , he had himself climbed naked into the garden , and sung a song there , until the neighbors complained ; two of his guests had climbed down and lifted him back through the window . It had seemed to them that this tenantnever slept . " Could you just tell us , though , " Kate said , one evening after dinner , " what is that final nightly thud ? " The eight-year-old Greek boy had been sitting on the toilet since dawn . He left the door open , so that he could watch the events in the awakening house . Each morning at five , there was a tremendous braying , squawking , mewing , barking in the street . The mules were climbing the hill and annoying the cats and the chickens . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roosters , which had crowed intermittentlyall through the night , gained confidence that day had , in fact , arrived , and began to crow incessantly . The noise of the mosquitoes had , at least , subsided , by the time the boy assumed his watch from the toilet seat . At eight-thirty , his grandmother called him to the kitchen . What she did in the kitchen was never clear . In theory , she was the maid . She could not cook . The point of cleaning seemed in some way to escape her . The principle that you take a clean thing to wipe a dirty thing , that the formerly clean thing becomes thereby a thing to be washed in its turn  --  this principle was , every morning , seriously confused . In any case , when his grandmother called him , the boy went to the kitchen . I wentp102to the lavatory and flushed . I flushed again . All over the house , people sat up , startled , in their beds . Between sixteen and twenty-two Americans had been staying there all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four on each of the two terraces , no less than three in any bedroom , and a few others scattered elsewhere about the house . There were only two bathrooms ; water was expensive . It had been agreed that no one would ever overfastidiously flush . Few people in the house woke up much before noon . Most stayed up on the terraces until four every morning , drinking and looking at the sky . I brushed my teeth . I went to the kitchen , put on water for coffee , and got a cup of yoghurt from the refrigerator . The grandmother and the boy stood there and smiled . I wiped off the breakfast table with a sponge . I sat reading a thriller in the sun . By nine o'clock , Lyda awoke . Lyda likes houses ; she is good with them . She went directly to the kitchen , where , every morning , in a monologue , accompanied by many gestures , she gave the maid what were meant to be the household 's instructions for the day . The grandmother did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , whom Lyda considered less intelligent , was by this time standing in the kitchen , too . It was hard to understand on what basis Lyda made any evaluation of mother and daughter in terms of intelligence ; neither had ever given a sign of comprehending even the other . But the daughter responded to any request or instruction with an expression that suggested that , while she did not understand a single word , she had never heard such degrading , stupid , insane words in her life . She conveyed this impression by causing her head to loll forward , her mouth , with the corners down , to hang open , while she exhaled in indignationand contempt . Then , she would utter her single , all-purpose syllable , " Buh . " After the daughter had done several tones of " buh , " ranging from incredulity to outrage , the mother would begin winking , with little conspiratorialsmiles , while she pronounced a range of mono/syllables of her own . This may have been meant to imply that the mother was , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , consistent in never obliging Lyda , or anyone , in anything . The household lived that month on drink , the local yoghurt , sometimes eggs , and an impromptu parody of wartime rations : Spam omelet , breaded cucumbers , sprat casserole . In almost every thriller , a point is reached when someone , usually calling from a phone booth , telephones with a vital piece of information , which he can not divulge by phone . By the time the hero arrives at the place where they had arranged to meet , the caller is dead , or too near death to tell . There is never an explanation for the reluctance of the caller to impart his message in the first place . Certainly , the conventionexisted well before the age of the tape recorder and the wiretap . Not on the phone , in a spy or mystery story , has always been , in and of itself , sufficient to hold up the resolutionof a case for a long , long time . This is particularly remarkable in the sense that when , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or piece together the message of the original caller , that message invariably consists of a very few words . Joe did it . Or , Not I. Or , The League . The trouble with islands is that such cases , of necessity , go unsolved there . When there is no phone . The dyes from the paper factory were seeping downhill to the gelatin factory , creating blue , brown and even dappledjello , and serious litigation over water rights . That was two miles inland . On the hill directly above the port , the young shipowner , who loved the view over his flowers to the ocean , set sprinklers in the garden every morning . His neighbor downhill and to the right made various claims about this water : that it seeped down in such a way as to undermine the foundations of his house ; that it cascaded down in such torrents that his dog had nearly drowned ; that his children were threatened ; that dog andp104children had already suffered colds and incurred psychologicalharm . These claims were set forth each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every evening , the young shipowner wrote his own elegant , but after a time witty and brief replies . Although the houses were not many yards apart , the correspondencewas carried on by the regular post . When the postal employees joined in the island 's wave of general strikes , the letters were interrupted , as was everything . Back here , the enmity began when the tenant on the third floor , an early riser , stole the Times of the tenant on the fifth . On weekdays , the third-floor tenant would acquire his paper honestly , along with his cigarettes , on the way to the school where he was a history teacher and guidance adviser to the senior class . He was a bachelor . On Saturday mornings , he would escort whoever had spent the night with him to her own place ; or , if he had spent the night at her place , he would return alone . In either case , he would buy a paper on the way . On Sunday , however , and within a few months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upstairs neighbor 's Times . The first theft had been , in a way , accidental . He had assumed , from the silence on the staircase all weekend , that the fifth-floor couple were away . He was wrong . The fifth-floor husband , having come down to the sidewalk , and found his newspaper missing , ranted all the way up the stairs to the fourth floor , where he paused for breath . I live on the fourth floor . The third-floor tenant , as he subsequently explained to me , thought this humorless of our neighbor . Some weeks , he stole the whole paper ; some weeks , just the News of the Week in Review . I do n't think there is a reader of the Sunday Times in the world who does not , every Sunday , experience some anxiety that his News of the Week in Review section will be missing . The fifth-floor tenant was beside himself . It is possible that there will be murder , in the end.  |p105She  did not know the way . They had arrived for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it happened , met . They had drinks and dinner . When it was time to leave , the hostess , remarking that they both lived in the same neighboringtown , and knowing Marge 's sense of direction to be poor , suggested that Joe lead the way back . So they drove through the night , he in his old Packard , she in her battered Ford . Along the curves of the back road , on the highway , on the dark back roads again , she maintained the distance between them perfectly . When a car passed her , and seemed about to stay behind him , she passed the car easily in her turn . Watchingat intervals , for miles , through the rearview mirror , he saw her driving smoothly , keeping that steady distance ; he had not needed to slow down . It turned him on . Years ago , when we were not even the same people , years and a lot of separations ago , Aldo and I went to the particularbar in Venice where he and his friends had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at boarding school . The bar was not crowded . Italian workingmen came in , had one quick drink , and left . There were only four bar stools . Aldo and I sat down . We ordered drinks . Aldo was certain the bartender recognized him , that he was holding back any sign of recognition until the regular customers were gone . Over our third drink , Aldo began to speak his Italian , of which he was proud then . After a time , the bartender , who turned out also to be the owner , did remember , or claimed to remember , the young Americans who had come to his bar so often , seven years ago . He called to a back room , to his two brothers , who came out and sat on the stools beside us . Aldo ordered Scotch all around . He was congratulated many times on his fluency in Italian . The brothers pronounced it incrediblefor one who had spent so short a time in Italy . He was , for a moment , hurt by the qualification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily smiled . One more round of Scotch . Then , the bartender , with solemnity and in friendship , brought out the house brandy and treated us to a drink . Thep106house brandy was greenish brown , with the texture of the filling in a many-year-old bonbon . It seemed , after all those drinks , not bad . It was also the particular house drink that Aldo remembered with such fondness . Seeing how happy the first glass seemed to make him , the brothers insisted that we drink several rounds of it . Our pensione was extremely squalid . I have no memory of crossing Venice to return to it , although we did get there . The pensione was not on any canal . It is probable that we walked . We were the only transients . There were six permanenttenants , women , staying in the place . They were not young . They wore black . They sat , most of the time , in the dark parlor , which had stained , stuffed chairs on a floor of dirty linoleum . They discussed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes not . Often we heard them through the wall of our bedroom . I was certain , it only stood to reason , that they also heard us . Aldo said that was paranoid . If they heard us , that was their problem . He had to like the place . It was the one they had all stayed in that boardingschoolsummer . Or he thought it was . And if it was n't , it was certainly like it . Or near it , anyway . It was n't the sort of neighborhood you could forget . From the moment we first arrived , in any case , and gave the concierge , or proprietress , or whatever she was , our separate passports , and she hesitated , and then thought what she could charge and decided to admit us , it was clear that the six old Venetian women had a lot to talk about . When we got back to the pensione from the bar with the house brandy , we went through the parlor to our room . We went to bed . Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I had ever been in my life before , or have been since . There was a small sink in our room . Within a short time , I had exhaustedthe possibilities of this sink . The pensione had only one lavatory . Under somewhat better control , I managed to put on Aldo 's raincoat and go there , to be sick . Then , I went back to our room , tidied up , brushed my teeth at our sink , went to bed and passed out . When I woke up , just at dawn ,  |p107I  felt almost well . It seemed only right to check on the condition of that lavatory , though , before the other guests got up . Aldo was still asleep , I thought , but looked healthy . I found my own trench coat this time , and set out down the hall . Four of the women were in the doorways of their rooms ; the other two sat in chairs they had put outside the lavatory door . They stared . They smiled . They clucked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back to our room . The woman across the hallway nodded , cooed , made a cradling motion with her arms , and said , very slowly and distinctly in Italian , Perhaps he will marry you now . I smiled at her . I went into our room and shut the door . Maybe it was a hangover . It was certainly the most wretched moment of my life . I got back into bed . Aldo moved , woke up , groaned . " I feel awful , " he said . I said I did too . The house brandy , I thought . He shook his head . He did look worrieder , sadder even , than I had ever seen him look . He said , " I do n't know whether I can tell you . " It was unlike him . For a minute , I thought he was leaving , then realized he was n't . " It 's only me , " I said . He said , " Well , you especially . I do n't know what you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shut my eyes . He coughed . He said , " I made love to you . While you were out cold . " Pause . I said , " No . I remember . I would have thought I was awake . " He said , " I do n't mean then . Later . " I did n't say anything . He said , " Twice . " I waited . Silence . I said , " Well , I guess I missed it then . " He said I honestly did n't have to be as nice as that about it . He clearly meant that . Miserable as I was for my own reasons , I could tell he did mean that , whatever it was . I said , " Well , I guess I do n't understand . " He said , " You do n't ? " I said , " No . " He said , " Really ? " I did n't say anything . He coughed . He said , " Necrophilia . " So I was in despair because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I was pregnant by a man who did not want to marry me , and he was in despair because he thought he was a necrophiliac . Both despairs were genuine . It may be that we were retarded.  |p108We  were younger . We were other people , anyway , in another world . SoA e images yellow and dry out like parchment . Some casts of mind become obsolete . " And fold their tents like the Arabs , and silently steal away , " for instance , is a thoroughly dated idea . In its obituary of King Faisal , the Times mentioned , as an example of his modernism , the fact that in the 1930S he abolished slavery . As an example of his gift for poetry , there was the line , " See you . There be Arab . " Somethinglost in translation there , perhaps . Everywhere . Three holidays . On New Year 's Eve in Zurich , it is customaryto bring in a live and healthy piglet . Precisely at midnight , everyone kisses it on the snout . While this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meant to bring people a year of luck . One year , my parents and I were , on a New Year 's Eve , in Zurich . We were having dinner in a hotel restaurant . The other guests , except for the Germans , had all been relatively restrained through dinner , although most people seemed to be drinking steadily . Shortly after eleven , there was , at all the tables , that awful and rising tension . It grew . People drank more . At one minute to twelve , a dignified old headwaiter dashed in through the doors of the kitchen . The piglet was struggling under his arm . At midnight , he began to hold it out to one guest after another . Nobody seemed to skip it . Some people shyly or desultorily pecked at it . Some people seemed actually reverentabout it , as though they were praying or making a wish . Some of the young Swiss and Germans who were drunkest tried to turn the thing into an amorous joke . Distinguishedlookingmen tried to look as though they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was kissing the snout of that struggling pig . My mother was worrying about germs , but very apparently worried . When the piglet got to her , she hesitated a moment , then kissed the tip of her finger and touched the piglet 's nose . That seemed to lighten other peo/pie 's quandaries . I just patted the piglet . A couple at the only table that came after ours just gave it a hug . In a public school in a run-down section of Brooklyn , Mrs. Cavell , under a grant for special projects , was conducting her kindergarten civics class . " What are you ? " she would say to her little people , right after the bell each weekday morning . " I 'm free , " they had learned to say , as one . On a particularly cold , bleak morning of midwinter , Mrs. Cavell tried a variation . " Today , we are going to say it in our individual voices , " she said . " When I call on you , I want you to stand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are you ? " JeffersonAdams got it . " I 'm free , " he replied . " Right . What are you , Franklin Atell ? " " I 'm free , " Franklin Atell said . Mary Lou Jones had to be asked to speak up , but then she said it firmly , " I 'm free . " Up and down the rows of carved and gum-stuck desks in the pre-school classroom , the words rang out , but Mrs. Cavell , a good soul , who had taught for thirty years in Brooklyn , saw a look of somehow disquieting resolutionon Billy Martin 's face . " What are you , Billy Martin ? " Mrs. Cavell asked . " I am four , " he said . The Piano . The rich grandmother was always giving her grandchildren presents which had to be put away until the children were old enough to care for them properly . On one birthday , the five-year-old was given his great-grandfather 's pocket watch ; his twin sister was given an extremely fragile eighteenth-century doll . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had reached such an intensely tomboy phase that , although she was constantly on playing fields or in the trees , she refused to change out of a single set of clothes , or to permit them to be washed  --  was given a strand of pearls . For his graduation from grammar school , the twelve-year-old received shares in a utility . On other occasions , this grandmother bought expensive clothes or gold wristwatches , invariably in her own size , which she gave to the children with the suggestion that they grow into them.  |p110The  other grandmother , who was poor , took the children to the fiv - and- ten and gave them things that could be put to immediate use . She was , perhaps unfairly , far the more populargrandparent of their early years . Twenty years passed . At Christmas , in this country , as before in Germany , the family did not have a tree . Not being at all devout , however , and having grown over the years to a considerable number , including one great-grandmother and seven small children , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This accommodation became increasingly festive and odd . Christmas was called Christmas , but it was celebrated on any day in December when the entire family could make it , could return conveniently from their separate places to the country house where the grandparents lived . This day seldom , any longer , fell on December 25th . Decorations were eclectic . Presents were placed , in fact , on and under the piano  --  an old Steinway grand that no one any longer played . Out of a vague conviction that the youngest children ought to be reminded that they were not really quite Christians , their grandmother yearly lighted candles on the eight-branched silver holders , which she had inherited from her own grandparents , and which were polished for whatever day was the designated Christmas of the year . The maid , however , a strong-minded Catholic , felt the occasion was too bleak with just those frail and flickering candles . Yearly , she placed more ribbons , tinsel , twigs , pine cones , and finally colored light bulbs on the piano and around its base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the largest present on the piano , it was thought that she had gone too far . The angel was removed . The presents were an annual disappointment . The greatgrandmother , who approached the occasion with the highest expectations , liked to unwrap , not just her own presents , but everyone 's . Among the youngest children , this sometimes brought tears . The grandfather , who pretended not to care about the holiday , every year , until the precise moment whenp111the door to the study , where the piano stood , was opened and the presents were revealed , became , every year , at that moment , hopeful , eager , even zealous , and then dejected , utterly . No one had ever found a present that actually pleased him . " Very nice , " he would say , in a tight voice , as he unwrapped one thing after another . " Very nice . Now I 'll just put that away . " The year his sons gave him an electric razor , he said , " Very nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm too old to change the way I shave . " When they asked him at least to try it , he said , " No , I 'm sorry . It 's very nice . Now I 'll just put that away . " Everyone in the family , through a run of years , had taken this reaction as a challenge , to find him something , anything . But from the years of the clay ashtrays , through the year in the war when his nine-year-old son somehowbought him an object , at the fair , called a butter stretcher , to the years of things in gold , scrapbooks , and family poems , he was , for his own reasons but like almost everyone else , as saddened by Christmas as though the world had died . What everyone dreaded was the birthday song . Anthems are sung in crowded halls . You can stand and mouthe . Carolersand singers from the Fireside Book are volunteers . You can stand and smile at them , or go away . But when the birthday song is imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everyone will mouthe . Someone begins firmly , quavers . Others chime in with a note or two , then look encouragingly , reprovingly , at the mouthing rest . The mouthers release a note or two . The reprovers lapse . The thing comes to a ragged , desperate end . If the birthday person'sname is Andrew or Doris , the syllables at least come out . Otherwise , you can get Dear Ma-ahrk , or Dear Barbarasoo-ooh , or a complete parting of the ways  --  some singingHerbert , some Her-erb , some Herbie , and , if the generationsand formalities are mixed enough , Herbert Francis , Uncle Herbles , and Mr. Di Santo Stefano . The song is just so awful , anyway . I can not imagine , though , from what thep112double shyness about singing , about being seen not to sing derives . There seems to be no early trauma that would account for it . Someone may accuse a small child of being unable to carry a tune , although I 've never heard of this ; but surely no one then insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , just when the song has faltered to its abysmal close , the birthday person inhales somewhere near the candles of that hideous pastel cake , inhales , perhaps singes his mustache or gets frosting on his tie , gets wax onto the cake or , if it is a she , into her hair , sprays everything with the exhaling breath . Applause . But it may well be that having no respect for occasions means having no respect for the moment , after all . The onset of the state of mind consisted in a loyalty to objects . She apologized to one egg for having boiled it , to another for not having selected it to boil . Since it was impossible to know with much precision whether an egg prefers to be boiled or not to , she was always in a state of indecision , followed , as soon as she had taken any action , by extreme remorse . Since this is not far from the predicament of most people of any sensitivity or conscience , she passed for normal . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on as much by this matter of the claims and preferences of objects as by more ordinary moral quandaries . When these oscillations began to shatter her sleep and her poise entirely , it became clear something must be done . What we did was to leave her alone . Vlad told us one evening of two patients in a state asylum . One was catatonic , the other melancholic . The catatonic , like catatonics , just sat there . For years . But , also like catatonics , when once , after all those years , he bestirred himself , he did so with enormous energy and force . He tore his iron bedstead apart . He rushed into the next room and hit the melancholic , with tremendous force , upon the head . The catatonic relapsed . But the melancholic , from shock and surprise presumably , recovered . When Jane was mildlyp113struck by a Vespa , her aphasia and craziness went . She was fine . One more island , this one in the Caribbean . Our nationalitieswere mixed , as usual . Hendon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imbecilic . His sandy forelockwas always in place . His eyes were green . His hands were long , with very broad , flat fingers . He wore bathing shorts , with vertical stripes in rainbow colors . Quite late every morning he appeared on the beach with his girl , a tall , dark , thin person in black . It was said that she was one of the most highly paid models in England . Her presence with Hendon on the island had to be kept secret from anyone back home . Any home . It turned out that she had , in fact , been a model in London tabloids . It never did become clear why her secret must be kept . But visitors to the island were always rumored to be one of the best , or most highly paid of something , and preferably to have some mystery as well . Of Hendonit was said , and he cheerfully confirmed it , that he had spent nine years in English prisons , for the crime of having inflicted " grievous bodily harm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely thoroughly . He had been a gang enforcer . He had beaten several men almost to death . The explanation would have been enough to includeHendon among the other best and most and mysteriousmembers of the beach group , but he had another quality . Whenever he was asked to , and often when he was n't , he would pull down the front of his bathing suit and flash . He did this quickly and somehow discreetly . He did not dwell on it . He would pull up his trunks again at once , politely laugh . People began to call him the flasher . Jokes were made about the sexual honor of the white visitors among the black islanders . Other jokes like that . On the day the Queen was to arrive on the island , all the islanders gathered at the airport  --  which consisted of a shack and one runway of not altogether smooth tarmac . When everyone had arrived , by jeep or on foot , the governor of thep114island arranged them in an L-shaped line . The base of the L was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction from which the plane would land ; the spine of the L stood along the runway itself . Hendon and his girl stood in the base line , with the few whites who knew the Queen already and the few blacks who were island officials . Some people wore bathing suits . Some people wore sports clothes . Some people , mostly the island blacks , wore dresses , or suits and ties . Hendon was in his striped , many-colored bathing suit . There was the sound of an engine rumble in the sky . The plane appeared from the wrong direction , then circled and landed as it should . Everyone waved as it taxied down the runway . Hands could be seen to wave at the small plane 's window . The door opened . Pilot and passengers got out . Hendon flashed for the Queen . There was , of course , no way of knowing whether the Queen had noticed . With her lady-in-waiting , and a tall man who appeared to be limping , she paused to shake hands with everybody . The governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . She shook his hand . When she had said hello to everyone , and gone with her group , by jeep to her house on the tip of the island , Aldo and I somehow got into the jeep with Hendon and his girl . The girl drove . Hendonwas in a fugue state . He began an intense monologue , the gist of which was that the Queen had class . " Real class , " he kept repeating . He would emphasize his remarks by grabbing , from time to time , for his girl friend 's crotch . Impassive , she continued driving . She did not even turn her head . " Real class , " he went on . " She sees a man for what he is . She takes me for what I am . " He reached for his girl again . " Not , " he said , staring dreamily out of the window , " like these middle-class cunts . " He rambled on until we were on the hill to our house , when , in a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . With his open palm he slapped the left side of her face , and with the back of his hand the right . His girl just drove , as though this were windshield wipers , orp115some other feature of the jeep . " Was n't that something , luv ? " Hendon kept saying . Class . " I ca n't believe it , " people said , almost with passion . It was that year 's version of hello . " I ca n't believe it , " people said , on the beach , on the slopes , in hotel lobbies , in cells , at parties . Apparently incredulous , astounded , people met . Sometimes the rejoinder was " For God 's sake , " as in " Harry ! Maude ! I ca n't believe it . " " Marilyn ! Well , for God 's sake . " Sometimes people changed it slightly . When we had just come back to the office , a middle-aged couple , he with the heartiness of another era , she with a certain trembly superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I live and breathe , " he shouted . " Touch wood , " she replied  |p116The  Surveyor moon shot was , in many ways , the best , a coltish tripod on its spindly legs ; the first shot it transmitted back to earth was a shy little photo of the shadow of its foot . The Russian instrument had been , by contrast , stolid , plump ; it sat up there . We were not told what photographs it sent . The second thing Surveyor did was to use its little shovel , and to send back information about what it dug . It kept sending photographs , of its foot , of its other feet , Of its own long , thin shadow on the moon . After some weeks , its batteriesexpired . It had been useful . It was written off as dead . A few weeks later , sunwarmed , it suddenly began to transmit again . Taking those photographs of its shadows and its feet , like a tourist posed , bashful and proud , on its lunar monu/ment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Surveyor II was sent up , Surveyor I woke up yet again . They would both transmit . For weeks and months , they would wake up , drowse , wake up , transmit . They were frail and gangling , but they frolicked quite a long time on the moon . And , right after the first man landed and walked upon the moon , there was a television program in which a reporter for a network interviewed small children in their school about their views of the event . He asked various questions and received various answers , straightforward or coy . When he asked his last question , what was the moon made of , he heard from the smug children , about green cheese . Some said the moon was made of paper , two said neon light . A vote was taken . The green-cheese children , in their nyah nyah voices , seemed to have chanted everybody down . There remained one unconvinced , iconoclastic child . The moon , she said , in a sensible , lofty tone of pure conviction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our chin straps down , and the mouthpiecein the mouth , " the coach said to the ten-year-olds , in their expensive uniforms , preparing to play football . " Anybodysees wishbone formation , he yells Wishbone ! ' Do n't look at them , " he said , nodding toward the other team , which was from a larger town and looked a little older . " They 're bigger than us , some of them , but they 're leery of us and they 're thinking . Now , we 'll do our huddle , say our Hail Mary , and then , " he said , " we 'll get them . " It is true that we all grew up in a gentler spirit than that might reflect . It is also true that we are all here now , in our city lives , and our city jobs , and nobody came and got us for them in our bassinets .

To a baby , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place seems no more arbitrary than being picked up by other giants and put down in another place entirely . Here they were . A familyp118named Cavanaugh or something was being interviewed about its newest member , the infant Kim Su Cavanaugh , who was already fast asleep beside her teddy bear . The adult Cavanaughs , particularly Mrs. Cavanaugh , kept burbling about how happy they were . Asked how she felt , Mrs. Cavanaughsaid happy , many times . Then the Cavanaugh children were interviewed . The youngest Cavanaugh , a sevenyear-old , who looked particularly miserable and embittered , was asked how she felt to have a baby sister now . " Happy , " she said . The reporter asked whether there was anything she hoped to do with her baby sister . Her face became frightening . In what was still a baby voice , she said " No . " The reporter , happily insistent , asked whether there was anything she would like to teach her baby sister . The face contorted with thought for a moment ; then she said , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am normally the sort of reporter who hangs around , or rather , tags along . I have never been any good at interviews . The first man I was ever sent to interview was an English actor , middle-aged , successful , easy , talkative . I went , with my notebook , to see him backstage after his play , which was a hit . I was introduced to him . He said Hello . I said Hello , how are you ? It was the last question I could think of to ask . He managed to talk for quite some time . He said he was fine . He went on with an anecdote , in a little monologue . When he came to a pause and seemed about to falter , I tried repeatingthe last few words he had said , with a little interrogative inflection at the end . " Little interrogative inflection at the end ? " I would say , if he had just said that . That worked all right . I would repeat what he 'd said , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on another little monologue . He was not a reticent or a shy man . A boring man , in a way , but not at all shy . In the end , I was getting him down . Only a half-hour had passed . The actor 's words were slowing , limping ; one could hear his verbal engine cough . He smiled . He started up again . " You know , " he said , heartily , " I 'm veryp119eager to get back to England . " Pause . " To see my two sons . " He looked at me , encouragingly . I tried . " You have two sons ? " I said . " Yes , " he said . He was not going any further . I tried again . I tried to look moved . I scribbled in my notebook . " Two , " I said . " Sons . " He said , " Tell me , Miss Fain .

She became a systems analyst , taught nights at the New School , and was the assistant to a radical Fordham dean . She was living in Bedford-Stuyvesant when I first went to see her . I was writing about blacks in the city universities . There were hardly any . Mattie 's rooms were in an elegant townhouse of the sort that still exists in the middle of Brooklyn 's hardest criminal warrens . It was cold . The landlord was trying to drive the tenants out . Ninety slum tenants in a given space at the going rate per yard is more profitable than twelve bourgeois tenants , even at high rents . So it was cold . The radiators were off , the hot water was off , the boiler was off . Everything was off . Friends kept wandering into Mattie 's apartment to talk about legal matters . Everyone was drinkingbeer . I drank beer . I tried to look as though I knew what I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mattie finally said , " or are you going to sit there like death on a soda cracker ? " We became friends , of course . The reporter had arrived at the catastrophe without his notebook . He wrote down everything he could on the backs of blank checks . Long after midnight , when he had finished phoning in his story , he stopped , on his way home , at the neighborhood liquor store . He bought Scotch . He asked the clerk , who knew him well , to add on ten dollars cash ; he made out his check for the total . " My , my , what 's this ? " the clerk said , as he started to put the check in the cash register . " I ca n't cash this check . There 's endorsements or somethingp120all over the back . " The reporter mumbled wearily that they were story notes , that they were on the backs of all his checks that night . " Gosh , " the clerk said , when he had gotten the check approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " You must have been in a poetic mood . " Mattie was married in those days to a man who was , in effect , her brother-in-law . Mattie 's youngest sister , who worked in Manhattan , was still a citizen of Trinidad . She had met a Jamaican newspaper reporter . They wanted to marry . Mattie was a U.S. citizen . She married him . He went straight from the wedding to live with Mattie 's sister , which was the idea . Some months after I met Mattie , this brother-in-law became a fugitive from justice . This husband , really , since they had never bothered to divorce . Mattie was by this time planning to be seriously married , to the lawyer who took over her building 's tenants ' case . There she was , married to a fugitive from justice . Within weeks , he was on the F.B.I . ' s Most Wanted List . Mattie pretended to be bitterly pleased by this development . If the F.B.I . managed to find him , she would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known him had thought of him , anyway , as married to Mattie 's sister . The sister had n't liked him or seen him in years . A problem with the F.B.I . ' s Most Wanted List , however , is that , like the Bureau itself , it is designed to trace criminals who look a certain way . A glower , a scar , a tattoo , a maniacal stare , but a plain white male criminal way . When it comes to blacks , or to white students gone underground from campuses , the Bureau just ca n't find them , or , more specifically , ca n't tell them apart . Ca n't tell the blacks apart . Ca n't tell the loose , straight-haired college girls apart . It is a source of great embarrassment . Finding Dohrn , Alpert , Boudin , or even Hearst , when other people are constantly seeing them , is just not what these men are good at . Only last week , the Bureau announced that one of those fugitive girls might be " feigning pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatp121constitutes disguise . Whiskers , I would have thought , yes . Sunglasses even , a wig ; but pregnancy , no . Jim says I misunderstoodwhat the Bureau meant . The " feigned pregnancy " was considered , not as a disguise , but as a means of getting people not to shoot . I do n't know . Anyway , though they did find those California fugitives , in their purple jogging shorts , Mattie 's brother-in-law , so far as is known , has not even been seen . Seven years ago , I bought a rifle . When I took it home from the sporting-goods store , I found in the box , not the fully assembled thing , which I had weighed , and tested , and shot , but two pieces  --  one , almost the whole rifle ; the other , a little firing mechanism that had to be attached to it . There was also a little pamphlet , with a half page of instructions for putting the rifle together , six pages of instructions for joining the National Rifle Association . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without those instructions , particularly since the pamphlet included an application for membership . But I could not , no matter how slowly or how often I read that first half page , or at what hour of the day , understand how to attach the firing mechanism to the other part . Anyonecan do it . Any child who hunts squirrel , any hunter who can not read without running his finger along under the words , any psychotic halfwit who wants to shoot some strangerthrough the head . I could not fathom the problem in any way . I finally put the rifle , both parts , under a couch , where they gathered dust for years . One winter night , when the gas and electricity had been blown out of service by the wind , a man from the power company came by to restore light and heat . I waited , in the dark , while he did his job . When the lights were on , I mentioned the rifle . I said I 'd forgotten how to assemble it . He asked to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel and , with a single motion , clicked the second part in place . I use that rifle often now . I have always liked to shoot  --  not living things , but targets , and matchboxes andp122cans . But putting the damn thing together was and , I guess , always will be one of those simple operations of life that seem to complicate themselves altogether out of my range . Three of us used to take tennis lessons at the armory at eight-thirty every weekday morning . The light from the dusty bulbs was yellow and bad . The courts consisted of creaky floorboards overlaid with a thin sheet of rubber , which was cracked and patched with tape . We three first met , through our lessons , in September . We all played each day , with a crash-program fanaticism . For months , the instructorshad pointed out that we would all save money if we gave up our separate lessons . We all refused . Jane even played on weekends at the armory . Fran stayed home with her kids . On weekends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played with Stewart , who is the coach out there . He started to take me to see professional tennis matches , sometimes to a movie , once to a concert by the local piano teacher , who would have had a grand career but for his nerves . By summer , there were four mornings of tennis lessons with Stewart , four evenings for going to see movies or just driving around . He had a mustache and a beard , and gruff good manners . He was thirty-two . He wanted to work for mankind . He wanted to teach children . He felt bohemian stirrings . Altogether a good , confused man . On the courts , he never shouted , almost never spoke . None of the " Racket back , " " Watch the ball , " " Run , run , run " that drives one to distraction , although some people do not seem to mind . Once , at the armory , I heard the coach shout incessantly , for a solid hour , at the mayor . The most Stewart would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , an almost inaudible " Backhand . " He would slam the ball to the forehand side . That was his little joke . Once in a while , he said " Nice shot . " I used to say thanks , or mutter . Then , Stewart said the proper thing to say was nothing , or at most , un huh . So I said un huh . For the rest , he just kept hitting the ball to the outer limit of his students ' ability to return it.  |p123They  were run ragged . Their tennis improved . I have been wrong about a lot of things . I still have his tie . In the bar of his father 's hotel , with the leather chairs that give one the feeling of sitting in a wallet , Dommy has introduced a new drink , Last Mango in Paris . A steep decline . Of the four baby birds in the barn , three had learned to fly and one stood on the floor , looking stupid and making flappingmotions . Now and then , it would walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its siblings and snapped at by its parents . Then it would walk back into the barn again . The people in the house checked under the wheels of their cars to avoid running over this bird , and otherwise wished it well . On the third day , the children minced a worm and tried to feed the bird themselves . By the fourth day , one adult or another , thinking himself unwatched , would lean over the bird and mutter , and flap his arms in what he hoped was an exemplary way . On the fifth day , the bird was sitting on a high rafter of the barn with the rest of its family . It has not yet been seen to fly . Perhaps it walked up there . Like most lonely women , like most women of all kinds , Margaret Dageman had an imaginary lover , with whom she entered the conversation and even the gossip of her friends . I used to think this sort of lover was specific to girls or women who were left out . An imaginary lover explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was married and in Korea . He was not married or in Korea , he was nearby , but he worked odd hours . He was not nearby , he was at the end of some line where a train must be taken . Wherever he was , he was not placed to appear or to walk them to the door . I used to think it was only lonely women who , according to temperament , flatly said , or shyly intimated , or just insisted that they had , in fact , this lover , this escort , this beau , this young man , this fiance , whatever they called him , whom social necessity had obliged them to invent . But it is not so.  |p124It  is not so . Most women have had them , at some time in their lives , or all their lives . And I do not mean the private man of daydreams or psychoanalytic literature . It is of the nature of this invented lover that his existence be a matter of public knowledge and , with luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own news to perfection , he would be thought to be her profoundest secret , the steady center of her emotional life . I have known a woman 's own husband to be the central character in such a fantasy ; quite often , in the lives of intelligentor wordly women , the man himself is real . Quite often too , like most thoughts and suspicions , the fantasy has truth in it ; the invention may be reciprocal , or shared . In fact , the only thing this secret lover has in common with any classic rape fantasy is this : that it important that this story seem to come out in spite of a woman 's reticence and discretion , against her will . This leads to any number of false confidences , any number of lies told in the false confessional mode . It is a way for a romantic temperament to generate its story line , its lifelong plot . He may be elusive . He may be importunate . He may be neither , or both . He can be anything . The major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was only that she engaged in a bitter , an epic quarrel with him . The mangy dog in the hallway had a grieving look and a furrowed brow . He had been picked up in the street by a lady who attracts animals . Once , a large , rare bird had flown directly from the zoo , on the board of which the lady was , and perched on the lady 's window sill . She called the zoo . The keepers had just noticed at that moment that the bird was gone . They came with a large and elaborate net to pick up the bird . The whole incident came to be regarded as an uncanny moment in the zoo 's and the lady 's history . Anyway , she had now attracted this mangy dog . He was not full-grown . The lady 's own dog , shiny , adult , well-fed , had an affronted look . I offered to take the stray . I regretted thep125offer the next morning . If people were always to cancel on the basis of the next day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the lady and both dogs arrived at our brownstone . When they got to the living room , they all sat down . " Now , think pleasant thoughts , Luke , " she said to the grieving dog . " We named him Luke , " she said to me . " Do n't you think he looks like a Luke ? We have tried to get him to think pleasant thoughts . You must remember to medicatehis ears . " Luke moved in . Ben , our photo editor from Georgia , said Luke looked like what is called a coon hound in the South . The great lady philosopher said , " Now , never mind . That 's an authentic dog . " Within a month of Luke 's arrival , and during the convalescence of his ears , he moved next door . I do n't know how he managed it .

Joel thought , in particular , that he understood other people 's pleasures when he had found the word for them . That 's a tango , he would say , with considerable satisfaction , to the girl he had brought to sit beside him at a prom or , years later , in a night club . That 's a lindy , now , and there 's a waltz . They would sit . He would smile . They would watch . He would name what went by . It was the same in Joel 's work , and in everything else with which he had to do . An elegant exposition , Joel would say , when one of his colleagues in the chemistry department had just set forth a breakthrough in a lifetime 's experiment . Or , Al has just birdied the sixth , that 's an inside straight Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the B-minor Mass , that 's a fado , they 've been raising black angus , they 're called collard greens , actually , Kate and Martin still seem enamored of each other , do n't you think . This insistence on calling thingsp126something had little to do with true pedantry , an obsession for getting things right . Almost any formulation would suit him . It was a more primitive instinct , in some ways  --  as though to name a thing were to cut its nails and hair , and pocket them , and put the adversary in his power . In another way , the instinct was entirely modern : to impress on everything that passed his way Joel 's word for it , his personal bureaucratic rubber stamp . Edith Piaf was in one of her many , absolutely last concerts at the Paris Olympia . She was singing " Je ne suis pas folle . " She ended the song , as always , with maniac laughter . On this particular evening , someone way back in the theater echoed that laughter . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least a heckler . Then it was thought to be part of the performance . But when that insane laugh continued , bitter , chilling , on Edith Piaf s precise note , like one tuning fork of madness responding to another , three ushers and six members of the audience escorted the laughing lady , with infinite courtesy , to the street . Joel was the only man I ever knew whose car had a seat belt on only one side , his . There was something about him that made it unthinkable to laugh , or even to dislike him after all . In my first year of graduate school , I found myself , for instance , in Joel 's car , for what he called a rallye at his motor club . Whatever I thought he meant , it never occurred to me that Joel was going to drive in it . The race turned out to be as much for mileage as for speed . Fifteen points on the map were to be driven to in any order . The car that reached all fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other winner would be the car that reached them all by travelling the fewest miles . At the end , the judges would decide between these winners for the trophy . I did not understand what other standards would apply . Also , I can not read maps ; my sense of direction is so poor and unstable that maps somehow make it worse . They bring on confusions not onlyp127of east-west , north-south , but also of left and right . Joel , who had no way of knowing that , explained the race to me , told me to navigate , handed me the map , fastened his seat belt , and drove . We never saw any of the other cars again . We reached the first point in three hours , the second never . All through the afternoon and into the evening , Joel , pale , would say to me , from time to time , in a flat , strained voice , which had its gallantry , " It 's all right . I 'm not competitive . " We went skiing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours through a blizzard , in the car of the natural athletes  --  jumpers on trampolines on Mondays , squash players and ice skaters on other week nights , and just to top the note of general health , players of string quartets on Thursday afternoons . The athletes were impatient with the snow that slowed the driving . They approached a cliff en route and climbed it , in an interim show of fitness . We barely followed . It was ice . Then the athletes whooped , dived and slid headfirst down the cliff . It was steep . The athletes seemed invigorated . They drove on . When they reached the ski hut , everybody put on snowshoes . After ten steps , I thought I might not make it . Skiing was worse . With great effort , I maintained a slow and trembling snowplow recalled from childhood , side to side , graceless , across the mountain , worriedby passing schussers , cold . " It wo n't hurt you , you know , " one of the athletes said , as though he were imparting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Downhill . One of the President 's closest friends was interviewed , at length , on television . He repeatedly spoke of the President as a witty man . He stressed the wonderful sense of humor of this President . The interviewer asked him for an example . The President 's friend demurred . The interviewer suggested that the friend could surely think of one instance of it . The friend , beginning to smile , declined . The interviewerpressed for just a single example , just one remembered time . The President 's friend was beginning to suppress whatp128was obviously great mirth , as he started on this anecdote : The President , and this friend , and another friend were on an island . " And we had , " the friend said , " this pair of rubber legs , you know ? " He said this as though everyone had a pair of rubber legs . " This pair of woman 's rubber legs . And a wig , you know . " His amusement and anticipation were such by now that he could hardly hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President suggested that we put them "  --  here a laugh  --  " in the bed . So we put the wig on the pillow , and a blanket , you know , with just the rubber legs sticking out "  --  from here on , the laughter began to escape control  --  " and he told me to hide behind the curtain , so when Bob came in "  --  by now , he was laughing so hard he had to pause  --  " I was hiding behind the curtain . And he showed Bob the bedroom , and the bed had the wig and those rubber legs , you know . The President did n't say anything about it . And Bob , well , I thought Bob was going to ... " That was it . It was not just his laughter that indicated the anecdote was over . It was clear that , whatever he had thought Bob was going to , the President 's friend 's account of the President 's sense of humor seemed to him complete . Well , I voted for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I do n't see any reason why a President should be a witty man , or a man responsible for the assumptions of his closest friends about his wit . He 's out , as Manuel said , " Mr. Nixon has go out . " He 's not at his desk . He 's in a meeting . We worked for that , too . And that sort of anecdote does n't come into it at all . It was just the exoticismI was not prepared for . The most natural thing in the world , a pair of rubber legs . A tall man was beginning a Tiny Tim sort of grateful frenzy  --  covering his ears , and shaking his head and saying , shrilly , often , how wonderful to him everybody was , how wonderful . Once , at a Christmas party on Park Avenue , when somebody was reading , beautifully , aloud from Dickens , I began to giggle , uncontrollably . It was that classic Tiny Tim and his damn crutch . I have always thought of thep129other , singing Tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Tiny Tim especially  --  being somehow bent to play out the American freak triumphant , to sing in falsetto about tulips , when what he longs to do , knows how to do , does seriously , is sing in exact imitation of 78 r.p.m. records , complete with scratches , old forgotten songs , in exact imitation of the voices of the dead . There he was , then , Tiny Tim , on the talk shows , in no sense a comedian but a loser meant to win it for the losers . The underside , a fifties person . Or rather , contra-fifties , in his peculiar way . For years now , there have been other , sounder contra-fifties people . Against all that modesty , domestication , niceness  --  Joe Namath , Bobby Fischer , Mark Spitz , Jimmy Connors , Bobby Riggs , Muhammad Ali . For the ladies , well , for the ladies , Marilyn Monroe , Sylvia Plath , Diane Arbus , Janis Joplin , Anne Sexton , and , after all on another racetrack , Ruffian . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides . Books about Ali . Ten years earlier , the preoccupation with Monroe . But there was a day , or there came , as Sam Dash would say , a time , when an actual Evel Knievel metaphor appeared  --  in an event that was inconsequential , small . The proposition was deep . It virtually spun . People were invited to see somebody ride his motorcycle over a canyon gap . That was what it was said they had been invited to pay to see . An early truth of the matter was this : it could not be done . The performer and his sponsors knew what he was going to do . The people who paid their admission knew what they were coming to see . By the end , the morally spinningproposition was this : when , by some miscalculation , the motorcyclist was actually exposed to a danger which he had not foreseen , when his parachutes almost failed so that he nearly did get killed ( not , it is true , in a manner that had anything to do with the alleged hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parachutes into the sides of cliffs ) , when , in short , the escape procedure became the menace , were the members of the audience entitled to feel cheated inp130any way . They had paid to see him die . He had arranged to escape unharmed . There was nothing of the old-style **31;2558;TOOLONG this thing . In their separate ways , neither party ever seriously entertained any notion that the motorcycle could rocket successfully over that canyongap . What did , then , occur ; what was the event ? A performer and an audience conspired that someone should be misled . The performer intended a motorized parachute jump . The audience paid to see a suicide . No fifties teamwork or nice-guy qualities in it anywhere . Nothing went according to plan . The question was who was misled , whom were they conspiring to mislead ? Why , history . For a perfect moment it was like almost every other event in public life . On the shuttle from Washington to New York , I started to take a seat in the first row . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crash , the tail section will be spared try to sit in forward rows , in order to save time in getting off . A stewardess said the first three rows on this flight were reserved . We all , resignedly , moved further back . One meek-looking man , however , balked , protested , said that this time they had gone too far . He knew , he said , they knew , everyone knew that federal law forbids reserving seats on shuttle flights . He would insist , he would notify , he would denounce . In fact , under the rule of first come first served , he would sit down . A stewardess , meanwhile , was gently herding him to the fourth row . A steward , looking young , and blond and fit , said the seats had been reserved for reasons of security . The ranting man demanded to know for whom . The steward said , for reasons of security , he could not tell their names . The rant had subsided to a grumble that passengershad at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any celebrities they were being put through this absurd outrage for , when a group came aboard and sat down in those seats . Among them , laughing , with a black patch across his eye , was a passenger who would cause any other passenger in the world to recognize a problem of security.  |p131An  extremely old , infirm and doddering lady , carrying an enormous bag , part wicker and part canvas , had meanwhile quietly taken an aisle seat in the first row . She sat , staring straight ahead and trembling , apparently unaware that her presence was now the subject of discussion , in at least two languages , throughout the plane . A man in the new group , who was himself carrying a large canvas parcel , whispered a while with two men in the third row and then approached the lady , with the evident intention of asking her to move . He stopped , shaking his head . He could n't do it . He walked back , to a seat in the fourth row . Passengers of all sorts and races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evidences of fanaticism . The steward , a stewardess and the co-pilot were now whispering . Just before takeoff , when the plane was full , the stewardess bent over the old lady , trying to get her to part , at least , with that enormous bag . The lady sat , at first , not hearing , trembling . Then she said , " My crackers , inside . I am going to want . " As the plane started down the runway , the lady rummaged and found her crackers . The bag was examined , discreetly , and put away . We took off . Halfway to New York , she ate her crackers . Then , surprisingly , she got up and began to wander toward the rear . After a few steps , she went back to her seat , beckoned to a stewardess , and began to mumble for a while . The stewardess elicited the information that the lady 's son was a famous journalist , that she had recognized the renowned man in the seat behind her , that her son would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such a person , that her best friend , who was in any case at times these days quite senile , would not believe it either , that in sum she would like that man 's autograph . There were consultations . Then she got it . Then she had no place to put it . She required her bag . There was another ripple of apprehensionthat she might be , after all , the world 's most improbableterrorist , with a weapon hidden , after all , in that enormousbag . She spent the rest of the flight , though , staring , doddering , holding on to the bag by its string.  |p132The  sign that Manley Dubois had entered a woman 's life might be her collection of Billie Holiday records . Women confided in Manley Dubois . They described him as the only man they could trust . There is a high edge of ill temper in vain women which no other women and , among men , only a self-parodying category of homosexuals permit themselves . The edge is common in women who have been beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists in women of power in the arts . Such women  --  and extremely gentle women  --  have confidences . Everyone has secrets . Most women have shames or sins or crimes . But confidences , apart from the lives of schoolgirls , belong to women of timidity or power . It was these that Manley encouraged to share their grief , their blues , their sense of life and earth , with him , through any singer one could love . At lunch , or of an evening a deux , in that tipsy intimacy which was his special note , Manley often comforted the woman who was confiding in him at the moment with the secrets of the woman who had confided in him the evening before . Dubois was a writer , who had played a great part in the creation of the particular society in which he moved . People in a confessional frame of mind rarely drew the obvious inference . Or perhaps they simply would not be deterred . When he finally came to write about it , it turned out , strangely , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , a lady from public broadcasting called . I had been watching Medical Center . A girl who would require open heart surgery was in love with a young man who had just had his appendix removed . He was retarded . He was in love with her , too , over the objections of his sister , who was possessive about him and hurt his feelings a lot . The lady from public broadcasting asked whether I would like to take part in a symposium on Politics and the Media . I said I could n't . She asked where she could reach Jim . I said I thought at the office . She asked whether Ip133thought Jim would like to participate in a symposium on Law and the Media . I said I did n't know . Then , she said , " Hey . Are you watching Medical Center ? " I said I was . It turned out she had been watching it too . We talked awhile longer . She asked if I ever listened to radio . I said I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our marathon reading of Trollope and Proust , we 're going to move right into the Federalist Papers . " She laughed . She asked whether I would like to participate in a symposium they were having on the female orgasm in fiction . I said , thanks but no . She asked if I could suggest somebody . They had five people ; they needed one more . I said I could n't think of anybody . Could I suggest any novels , though , besides the ones they had already thought of . I said I could n't think of any besides the ones they must have thought of , Ulysses , D.H . Lawrence . She said , And Mrs. Dalloway . I said , Mrs. Dalloway ? For weeks , I had been stalking the prowler . He stood , late most nights , just inside the glass outer door of the house , in the hallway , fumbling with the doorknob of the secondhand dress shop , which is on our ground floor . He just stood there , fumbling and smoking many cigarettes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he would leave , brushing by me and muttering . At other times , when he did n't notice me , I would watch him . Some nights , I thought of locking the glass outer door while he was in there , and holding it locked until someone came and caught him ; I could not quite imagine , though , how that would end . Last month , I really did catch him . I had been out to dinner , which I left early , in order not to get drunk . It was on Fifth Avenue . I found a cab . An elderly gentleman , who had left the dinner too , got in beside me . He said it was not safe , after dark in this city , for a lady to take a cab home alone . He dropped me at my door . He said we ought to have lunch , please to call him . He went off in the cab , not having noticed the prowler inside the glass door . I had n't noticed him either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't notice me at all.  |p134I  walked a few steps away along the sidewalk . There was nobody else around except one young , cheerful man walking toward me . " Excuse me , " I said . " I live two houses from here . There 's a prowler inside the doorway , in the hall . " The young man walked back . He looked in through the glass door . " I see there is , " he said . " I 'll walk you in if you like . If he is n't armed , I can take him . " I said , No , thanks . " I practically know him . This time I 'd like to call the police . I 'll try that pay phone at the corner . " He said , " I 'll walk you over . Just dial 911. 4II 's information . I 'll walk on this side . " We passed a few people on the way to the corner . The man walking with me suddenly shouted , " Phil . Hey , Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of a bearded man who had just crossed the street . They were delighted to have met . Another friend of Phil 's crossed the street then . There were introductions . Phil offered me a dime for the pay phone . I used it . I called the police . I gave Phil his dime back . We shook hands . They went off . My original friend had gone back to stand outside the glass door of my building . When a police car pulled up , he said , " Goodbye . Take care . " I said , " Thanks . " He went away . More squad cars arrived . Two policemen went into the building . Another squad car . I was now standing with six policemen at the curb . A slightly drunk , kind and friendly-looking man walked to us , and asked whether I was all right and whether I had a boyfriend . I said I had . He said , " Sure ? " I said , " Absolutely . " I pointed to one of the policemen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked away . It occurred to me , and I am almost certain , that he thought he was coming to the aid of someone alone , being arrested by six men in uniform , when , after all , it was I who called the police . Somebody was nudging my tray along the rail at the museumcafeteria . I was trying to keep my tray from bumping the tray ahead . I held my fingers firmly on the tray top , hooked my thumbs underneath the steel bar . The pressure of the nudging tray increased . I gave in to the superior determi/nation . Doubtless , the tray pusher had had an awful day . I let go . My tray slid into the next tray , which slid into the next , which crashed into another . At the cashier 's corner , there was a pileup . Tea bags , jello , trays all over everything . Our defense correspondent used to be so well informed that his pieces made only ordinary sense to readers of the paper ; to members of what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons analysts did not simply wonder what he might be up to ; they were scared . It was not at all clear what they were going to do about it . They themselves did not expect to be done away with at the end of their working days or even to enter anonymous retirement ; they expected to write thrillers during their careers and memoirs after . But they could not believe , on the basis of his columns , that the **25;2591;TOOLONG , far from being any sort of clandestineprofessional , was that rarity , a truly industrious reporter , doing a thorough job . Our editors did n't understand it , either . He was , finally , transferred away from defense matters . The correspondent , a modest man and a steady drinker , thought his transfer had to do with some deficiencyin his writing style . He already admired what were widely thought to be the great reporters . His early , happiest days in journalism had been as a reporter for his father 's failing rural paper . He had written a regular column called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had concernedan oak tree , which appeared to have the largest girth of any in Penn County . Immediately , he had received letters from county readers who claimed to have seen wider local oaks . He had gone to measure ; he had been fair . He had written columns about the largest egg yolk in the county , and the smallest , and the egg that contained the largest number of yolks . He had traveled around the county , solemnly breaking eggs to make certain just how many yolks they did contain . His column had inspired , always , a brisk and concerned correspondence . The paper 's circula/tion improved . His father raised his salary . Those were his best years . When , so many years later , he was transferred to the culture desk , he knew that he was through . It certainly does not do to have too low a threshold for being insulted . Even the affectionate insult , or the complimentwith any sort of spin on it , can reverberate in memory in awful ways . " I love your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had watched her walking toward him on the beach . He was so in love with her that , although he meant it , he may not even have heard what he said , exactly . She never forgave him . She slept with him for another year and then married his enemy and rival , the only man Paul had ever hated in the world . " You have beautiful eyes and lovely hands , " Leroy said to Jane , " and when you smile , to me you 're beautiful . " She never forgave him , either . She married him . Their life together was hell for fifty years . " Has anyone ever told you that you 're lovely ? " is , of necessity , a minefield . There is no conceivable proper answer . It all ends in disaster anyway . The lady was not just a vegetarian ; she had many theories , about food , and the elements around one , about smells . The smell of x-rays , the smell of diets of one sort and another . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , and the foods one ate . She pointed out she had heard that we smell badly to the Japanese . She interrupted her discourse for a moment , paused , and then turned to the sculptor beside her . " Do we smell badly to you , Mr. Omura ? " she said . Contrary to the lore of restaurants and hotel schools , I find the women I know do tip reasonably and drink a lot . They are all educated women , though  --  in that age group which learned its courtesies from its own mothers ; its loves from Paolo and Francesca , Bronte , Joyce , and even O'Hara ; and all the solid enthusiasms in its cast of mind from what we used to emphasize were not anthologies , textbooks , or otherp137secondary works , but from originals , the works themselves . Our ambitions were , nonetheless , what those of any sensible group of women at that time , perhaps at any modern time , ought to have been : to become safe and successful ; to marry someone safe and successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and success . From time to time , however , there is something , I do n't know , wistful , about how it has turned out . Not just Brecht 's great ship of the eight sails and the fifty cannon . The other ships . Perhaps the tall ships , the fleet , the craft , the other ships that do n't come in . It is not at all self-evident what boredom is . It implies , for example , an idea of duration . It would be crazy to say , For three seconds there , I was bored . It implies indifference but , at the same time , requires a degree of attention . One can not properly be said to be bored by anything one has not noticed , or in a coma , or asleep . But this I know , or think I know , that idle people are often bored and bored people , unless they sleep a lot , are cruel . It is no accident that boredom and cruelty are great preoccupations in our time . They flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , on the scale of things to feel , is trivial . It does not even constitute  --  as do humiliation , envy , guilt  --  an actual emotion , a condition of the soul . Its command of the attention is absolute . Someone who needs and does not have a handkerchief is likely to be as preoccupied as someone scared to death . Most of the safest form in this is established by form , by sameness , rote . For others , the stereotyped is most embarrassing . It is by no means clear on which side of this question humor is . A surprise can be comic , as can a certainty . Leaving humor out of it , there exists embarrassment pure . Alas . We had ordered martinis , straight up , with a twist of lemon . The waitress had brought martinis with olives . This had the force of an eclaircissement . " Not exactly a twist of lemon , " I said when she had left . " No , " Jim said , " it is n't . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . I stillp138make these inane attempts to have a conversation . Once , in a call from Natchez , Jim uncharacteristically interrupted a memo he was reading to me , to say , " Hello , are you there ? " I could understand what had happened . " Just because I have n't interrupted you , " I said , " you think I died . " I have lived alone now , I think , as long as anybody who is not a hermit or a kook or a spinster who keeps cats . Not entirely alone , but mostly  --  very far from intermittently . Jim , for instance , when he stays here , makes his telephone calls on his credit card . Rarely , somebody has called him here , collect . The last time was months ago . We were asleep . He was on the phone a long time . Jim did n't say much . He hardly ever says much . I wonder what we would ever talk about if there were no news . A lot of people depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deputy , seems to count on us both , separately , without any idea that we even see each other , except through him , Joe . There have been some odd results . Jim , having come in from New Orleans or Chicago , uses his credit card to call his office , where there is always somebody late at night . Message from Joe . Please call . I , having gone to meet Jim at the airport , call my answering service . Message from Joe . Please call . " You first , or me first ? " Jim says . " You , I think , " I say . Jim fixes drinks and brings them to the bedroom . " Maybe we ought to wait till morning , " he says . We consider it . He looks at his watch . He takes out his credit card , sits on the bed , and dials . The maternity ward was separated from the intensive-care ward by a small corridor in which there was a single pay phone . There were also two waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other with a bronze plaque , MEDITATION Room . " Dads " had a television set . " Meditation Room " had two burners and a coffee pot . The families of the patients wandered freely between them , for coffee or conversation or , at crowded hours , space . A senile friend of an intensive-care patient kept calling in , at all hours ,  |p139on  the pay phone . He was n't , it turned out , even a close friend . His persistence and his desperation were such that if we did not pick up the phone and talk to him sometimes , he would call the patient 's family or even the nurses in the ward , direct . Since everyone was always bringing chocolates to the nurses in intensive care , the doctors coming out of there were always chewing something . " Of course I have n't confused you with somebody else . Either it was you , or I made it up . " The operative thing about the parties was that everyone who was asked did actually go to them and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also scarcity , that would embarrass New York dropouts in a loft . The food was always served so late that the hard liquor , such as it was , had run out . The dishes that were meant to be hot were never quite as warm as those that were meant to be chilled . There were not only , for the intrepid , no seconds of anything , there was not enough to go around . This meant that everyone  --  ambassadors , actresses , bishops , fashionable congressmen , writers , professors and civic-minded nuns  --  pushed , quite violently pushed , in the direction of the food . When the worst was over , the hostesses were , for some reason , always overwhelmedwith compliments . They accepted these graciously . Then , they would begin to marvel about how inexpensively it had all been put together , how little bother or money it had cost . They expected the guests to marvel over this with them , and the guests did marvel . All of us . What we were doing in Washington was working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It changes its name every twelve years or so , but that 's what it is . At the staff offices , we had jobs as consultants , on a temporary basis , at a hundred dollars a day . We were paid thirty-five dollars more , for living expenses , on days we were actually down there , plus fares to and from LaGuardia ,  |p140O'Hare  , or wherever we were from . A pretty town , Washington , not too large . None of us had ever spent much time there before . At dawn , the joggers in sweat suits would be out , whatever the weather , as would the senator and his procurer , in their sports car with the top down ; joggers , senator , procurer , all pale and hungover , would wave . On Mondays , Tuesdays and Wednesdays , our people worked straight through the night . Thirteen secretaries , all night , on high stools in a warehouse , assembling notebooks . " Page 32 , Statement 28 , Tab 28.2 , " the head secretary would call out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high table before her , would put a Xeroxed loose-leaf page from the stacks on the floor beside her in all three . What they worked on then , these secretaries , calmly , cheerfully , with their smoker 's laugh and their smoker 's cough , were consoles . They sat like E. Power Biggs at their keyboards , typing words that lit up in neon , at each separate console , on a sort of TV screen . People would rush in and dictate changes in the neon paragraphs . When the page on the screen was edited and complete , the secretary would push a button . While she drank coffee , and we all stood there , drinking coffee , too , and watching , the screen would activate the typewriter and the keys would type , one line from left to right , the next from right to left , in alternation to the bottom of the page . For six months , the fact that the machines could type every other line from right to left , thereby saving the time that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody . When the neon had finished dictating its last line , the secretary would blank it out , erase the machine 's memory of it , and begin another page . By shortly after ten A.M. , most of the town 's pallor is gone . Most committees are in session . The tired , driven bureaucrats of the night have ceded the place anyway to the men who are , at least nominally , in power ; and these , communing with their hometowns or with the night officers at the remotest embassies , are busy exercisingtheir prerogatives . A much more gentle town , Washington , certainly , thanp141New York , pretty in its flowers and the scale of its houses , although every street in the last years is being torn up . At the fine hotels , the Hay-Adams , the Sheraton , the Madison , peopleoften sleep to the sound of iron scraping stone and jackhammerson macadam , whenever , for some reason , the work goes on in three shifts , overnight . At the cheaper hotels , like the Quality Inn near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after midnight , are actually locked ; people have to pound on the glass from the sidewalks to wake the night porters , who let them back into their hotels . Greg 's aunt was for years in love with an exiled African leader , who , being Catholic and already married , could not marry her . This tragic aunt had an equally tragic but more enterprising mother , very old , who had been in love with Russia  --  all of it . At the time of the Revolution , this lady 's thought had been for the English governesses of White Russian children . She had actually commandeered a train . With a confidence , for which she could subsequently find no rational grounds , that every English governess would go to her local railroad station and wait there , the lady took that train all across Russia , picking up English governesses , who were in fact waiting , along the way . Greg himself was on a story in Baghdad , at a time of public hangings and of violent , berserk crowds . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down corridors , screaming for vengeance , or , at least , for death . Rioters pounded on all the bedroom doors . Anyone who answered to the knock was murdered . Anyone who did n't answer , whether out of fear , or sleepiness , or a habit of not answering when no bellboyhad been summoned , was left alone . The aspect of a closed door seemed to check the crowd 's momentum ; it passed on . " Tic tac toe , two out of three ? " the four-year-old said , sitting down beside us . Then he drew five bars across and four bars down . Jim redrew it for him . The boy considered . He said , " I see . "  |p142The  judge had quite a number of generous impulses . He gave himself full credit for each of them . He did not carry any of them out . As a result , he was often puzzled and aggrieved by the demands the people closest to him seemed to make upon him . Though he would be the last man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why they were , on the whole , so damned ungrateful . His daughter , who was overweight , but for whom he felt considerable affection , seemed actually to fear him . When he found her reading the latest diet book , or doing calorie computations , he would point out to her that she was deluding herself : the problem was that she simply ate too much and exercised too little . When she avoided his eyes and , muttering denials , left the room , he would tell himself that she was at a difficult age . His moral vanity was great . When it was touched , he became dangerous . It is not at all uncommon for someone to arrive at a scene of brutality or injustice and , with a sympathetic murmur or heroic flourish , attack the victim . It happens all the time . It underlies the columns , for example , of Dr. Franzblau . But the particular consequence of his moral vanity was that when he did people an injury , he never forgave them . Never again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps there will be a defendant today , although we are not sure . Scholars and intellectuals make bad jurors , I believe . Their attention span is short .

Always together . False and misleading . Ca n't understand what the " misleading " is doing there . It 's always there . And I 've found , I think , the strongest " or " in language anywhere .

There seemed no reason not to . I took the book and turned to page 324 . " Read it aloud , " he said . What the hell , I thought . It was n't dark . I read aloud , what might have been a hymn .

It was nearly sundown . They had seen no other cars since noon . Then , in the distance , with the setting red sun just behind it , they saw a car , at the world 's edge , coming toward them . They laughed and kept driving . For several minutes , the two cars raced in their lanes toward each other . Drivers and passengers began to smile and wave across the desert . A few more seconds  --  laughing , shouting , waving  --  the two cars collided . There were twelve occupants in all , and none were dead when it was over .

We were in a restaurant near the Banque de France . Madame Devereux was telling her experiences of the war . She had rolled bandages . She had suffered privations , inconveniences . She had endured reports of the conditions at the front . At first , word of the ghettos in Eastern Europe had caught her sympathies . But then she was appalled . They , she was told on high authority , had stolen all the doorknobs off the ghetto doors , and sold the knobs . They were such salesmen ; she had been naive . But when , as Monsieur Devereux had known they would , they turned around and sold the bandages , Madame could roll no more .

" N'est-ce pas , mon petit , qu'ils allaient trop loin . " It was not one of us who overturned the glass . It was the dog . We were trying so hard . Maybe it was our French we were uncertain of . We had lined up . We had crossed the Atlantic on a small , old boat of the French line called the Flandre , which we called the Flounder  --  partly for the joke but mainly to avoid in each other 's presence that attempt to pronounce the French r , which seemed of such importance to us then . We had lined up for the carte de sejour and the identity card , for student accreditation and for the certificate of equivalence to our American degrees .

Only the least serious of us roamed the streets at night , chanting " La Paix en Algerie " with one student crowd , or " Algerie Francaise " with another , until the two groups filled the boulevards , converged , and , with the help of massed policemen swinging weighted capes , rioted .

" Far from it . Far from it . " The most important line , the longest and the most embittered , was the line for the student restaurants . Some people stood in it for forty-six straight hours . The restaurant card required that all other cards and documents be in order .

We spoke of the quality of the blue in thep148stained-glass windows of Chartres , which modern science had not been able to reproduce , as though the medieval craftsman who had produced it were a colleague . He had , we knew , billed his diocese for the purchase of sapphires ground up to create that color . Modern science had , at least , establishedthat sapphires played no part in its composition at all . It was our first , most scholarly appreciation of the padded expense account .

No school tomorrow , she would say  --  often quite late for a small child to be up on a cold evening : Scragg Day , or Teachers ' Records Day , Moss Day , State Commemoration Day , or High School Bus Repairs . Mysteriously , these holidaysdid exist , although few of them recurred from year to year .

In her senior year , however , Jametta sat in front of one Alvin Benso , in the first row of Miss Keane 's English class . We were doing our required Shakespeare play . The state seemed to require of its students one half year of world history , Mesopotamia to the present ; one half year of American history , Jamestown to the present ; one solid year of Biology , in which one earthworm and one frog must be dissected ; and , somewhere in four years of English classes , a Shakespeare play . Miss Keane 's method of teaching Shakespeare was to assign parts for reading by row , characters in order of appearance : first seat , first row , first part , and so on along the rows . The class was doing The Merchant of Venice , Miss Keane 's favorite . Miss Keane had done her disquisition about Shylock  --  a villain she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many traitorsin our own time , our own country , brainwashing our boys abroad , flashing subliminal messages on television , stealthily approaching , if they did not already have , our minds .

Cells were dying continuously in this same fashion in AIda 's body , in my body , in Miss Head 's body . When cell death got out of hand , though , and the forces of chaos won out over those of elaboration and order , what happened ? Those cells synthesizing the most protein burst first  --  the adrenals , the testes , the pancreas , the gastrointestinal tract ; then the liver , kidneys , endocrineglands .

Reluctantly , she put it aside to play AIda 's death aria on her cello , at my insistence . I listened with detachment , without the faintest twinge of fear or sorrow . I had spent my afternoon productively . I had seen Death , and it was no big deal . Only the unfamiliar had the power to stir neurotic emotions . So I reasoned . The next day in class Miss Head called on me to summarize Spinoza 's attitude toward the human passions . " Spinoza feels , " I stated confidently , " that in order to achieve virtue , a man must detach himself from the transitory passions that he suffers , so as to gain an understanding , through reason , of the nature and origin of those passions . Only by struggling to develop his intellectso as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Free ? " she prompted , with a pleased smile . " Free from his passions , which are simply a form of misunderstanding . Because to view the world as a whole , with all its **25;2648;TOOLONG , is to extinguish such fleeting personal whims . Free , in the sense of choosing to accept the inevitable . " Miss Head nodded , her face glazed with surprised pride . On my way back to the dorm for lunch , a green VW pulled over next to me . A pleasant male voice asked , " Can you please tell me how to get to Castle ? I 've never come in this entrance before and I seem to be lost . " Castle was my dorm . " I 'm going there now . If you 'll give me a ride , I 'll direct you . " I climbed in and inspected the driver . He was tall , thin , pleasant-looking , had brown hair and eyes that squinted in amusement as he talked.  | " Who are you looking for ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . This man clearly was n't her Jerry . She had admirers all across the Northeast ? " She 's on my hall . " " She 's my sister . " " Oh . " He parked the VW , and we walked through the vaulted stone porte-cochere and into the dorm . In the waiting room , I buzzed Marion on the PA system . There was no answer . " Was she expecting you ? " " Not really . I 'm at Harvard . I just thought it was too pretty a day to study so I decided to drive out and get her to give me some lunch and take me around your lake . But I guess I 've struck out . " I hesitated . I had a biology lab that afternoon , and a paper to write for the end of the week . But it seemed only civil to offer him lunch until Marion appeared . After all , she was more or less a friend of mine  --  as close to being my friend as anyone at Worthley , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I had n't been aware of what kind of day it was . But since he 'd brought it up , I had to acknowledge that there was a gorgeous sunny spring afternoon outside , the kind of overpoweringly sunny day that I had n't seen since last September . The grass was greening up , some early flowers were blooming , foolhardy robins were trickling back in from the South . " You could have lunch with me . Marion 's bound to be back soon . " " Oh , no , I do n't want to bother you . " " It 's no bother . I was going to eat anyway . " We ate asparagus tips on toast with Hollandaise sauce . He chatted amiably about himself , about being from Michigan and liking to sail and fly planes . He was studying architecture and described his projects and some of the interesting new buildings in Cambridge . " Come in sometime . I 'll take you around to see them , " he offered , in response to my very genuine interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I strolled around the lake . Birds were warbling in the trees as they built their nests . Tree branches were covered with swelling buds . Gusty breezes blew patterns of ripples across the lake surface and rustled last fall 's dried rushes . I talked about Hullsport and Miss Head and my various academic difficulties.  | " I know , " he said with a laugh . " It 's a whole different vocabulary these professors have . They 're like a subspecies of the human race . The trick to getting along with them is to become schizophrenic : Talk their jargon when you 're with them , be yourself when you 're not . " I looked at him closely . He said that with such deceptive ease : Be yourself when you 're not . Did anyone really know that effortlessly what his real self was ? I was almost convinced by now that my " real self " was in fact that aspect of me that most resembled Miss Head . But I was willing to listen to arguments from the opposition . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was no longer concerned about finding Marion , and I was no longer concerned about my biology lab . We lay in the grass by the edge of the lake and exchanged memories dredged up from early childhood . The spring sun beat down on our pallid faces and baked our winter-weary bodies . I felt as though a huge chunk of ice located inside my abdomenwere thawing . Fluffy clouds drifted overhead , assuming all sorts of fabulous shapes . On a hill across the lake were half a dozen small children . Two flew colorful kites out over the lake . The others tumbledaround in the new grass and rolled down the face of the hill like small puppies . I sighed with contentment . As I did so , I found my hand being held . Delicious sensations of warmth began creeping up my arm , and my fingers trembled in his . " Why do n't we go into Cambridge a little later ? " he suggested . " I could show you those buildings I was telling you about . And then we could have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square . " It required every fiber of self-restraint that I possessed to prevent my body from rolling over and snuggling companionably up against him . Thoughts of my unwritten paper were as distant and as uncompellingas memories of last winter 's ice storms . Just as I was about to accept , I jerked my hand away and scrambled to my feet , like Cinderella at the ball at midnight . " I 'm sorry but I have a biology lab , " I mumbled . " It 's been a nice afternoon . I hope you find Marion . " I whirled around and raced off . " Wait ! " he yelled . " What 's your name ? " I did n't answer . I was gasping for breath by the time I sprinted into the biology lab . Professor Aitken looked at me with displeasure . I mumbled apologies as I slipped on my lab coat . Half a dozen other girls were already working silently at their microscopes.  |p203I  prepared my slides , using specimens from a Petri dish teeming with protozoa . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , I focused in on an ever-smaller segment of the slide . Finally , I had a good picture of two protozoa , surrounded by dozens more . I could see the outer membranes that enclosed their cytoplasm ; and in the cytoplasm , the mitochondria where they produced energy , the nuclei which contained their genetic material . As I watched , waiting for nothing in particular , the two protozoa began approaching each other by extending their comical pseudopods , the tiny bulges of protoplasm that functioned for them almost like feet . When they were within a certain distance of each other , they appeared to perform some sort of dance : They moved toward each other ; then they backed away ; they circled each other ; they rotated in place . Finally , after many tedious minutes of this coy microscopic Virginia reel , they drew up side by side . Gradually , out of the side of one of the protozoa there extended a tiny point of protoplasm . This point grew and grew . Eventually it bridged the gap to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening , but the end result was that the bridge of protoplasm penetrated the other protozoa and merged with it , so that the interiors of the two cells were now continuous . " Professor Aitken ! " I shrieked . He came rushing over , his white coat flying behind him . " Something strange is going on with my protozoa ! " He peered through my microscope . " Oh yes , " he said , disappointedthat I had n't uncovered some Nobel Prize material . " They 're exchanging genic material . " " What does that mean ? " " It 's equivalent to what happens in human conception . Each receivesa portion of the other 's genes so that when each cell divides , the four daughter cells will be combinations of the two parent cells . It 's an elaboration on simple cell division . " " But why ? " I asked , forgetting for the moment my resolution only to ask " how , " never " why . " " So that evolution of the species can occur . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  couldn'ttake place , except randomly through trauma-induced mutation . " " How come these two picked each other to swap genes with ? " " ' Picked ' ? Please , Miss Babcock , try not to be so insistently an/thropomorphic . We think it 's simply a question of electrical charges on the cell membranes . But of course the same thing is going on all through the Petri dish . " By the time I returned to my high-magnification peep show , the one protozoa was retracting its protoplasmic protuberance , and the other was swimming languidly away into the surrounding soup . That night at supper I saw Marion . " I met your brother this afternoon . Did he ever find you ? " " Yes . He said he met someone from Tennessee . I figured it had to be you . He really liked you . But he said you ran off when he asked you out . " " I had a biology lab . " " I think he thought you were rejecting him . " I did n't say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I said , " I 'm really pretty busy this term . I do n't have time to go out . " She shook her head sadly . " Okay . Suit yourself . " I was very irritated by her solicitous attitude . Just because she spent most of her spare time on her back with her legs spread , she wanted everyone else to as well . Well , my destiny did not lie in some man 's unmade bed . I shut myself away in a library carrel that night and wrote a paper for my biology course . It was based on the concept that human emotionswere a repertoire of behavioral patterns bred into an organism , just as anatomical features were bred into it . The patterns characteristic of any given organism , love in humans for instance , were those that had exhibited survival value for the species as a whole . But it was quite possible that what was beneficial to the species might not be beneficial to the individual organism . And in such a case , the interests of the individual were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vivid feathering of some birds enhanced their mating prowess but also enhanced their vulnerability to predators . Individual survival was assigned a secondary place to species propagation by the Management . I , however , was a daughter of Spinoza . My talent lay in detaching myself from this scheme . I had studied sentic cycles ; I knew that each person 's finger presses a sensitized key in an identical wave pattern when that person is imagining situations that elicit a given emotion . I also knew that people could be trained to reproduce the wavep205pattern characteristic of any given emotion without reference to internalor external stimuli . I would not serve , under the guise of sublime emotion , as a vessel for chromosome interchange with Marion 's brother or with anyone else , be it for the well-being of my species or not . In short , I decided not to go out on any more dates . Not that my phone was ringing off the wall . I went home to Hullsport for the summer , having been dateless for two months and without sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory as a file clerk . The Major often took time out from his duties to diagram for me the chemical compositionof the explosives being synthesized there , and I admired the elegance of the formulas . All summer the Major and I were each other 's biggest admirer . The testing procedures at the factory had gained considerably in sophistication since the evenings of my childhood when the Major had bought us kids ice cream cones and had taken us to view his performancesat the test firing range . By now all the testing for detonation speeds was done in a blast chamber and was monitored by a huge pie-shaped camera that used special lenses and whirling mirrors to snap photographs at three-microsecond intervals . One afternoon , the Major invited me to a meeting of himself and the technicians who conducted these tests . They had the photo series from a test for a new explosive to be used in large shells consigned to a place people were just beginning to hear of  --  Vietnam . There were eight pictures in this series , which from start to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest speed on Miss Head 's metronome was four beats per second . Joe Bob in his track meets had striven against a stopwatch that was divided into hundredthsof seconds . Clem , even on the morning when he had nearly killed me , had been traveling only about 117 feet per second . But here in these photos , we were witnessing a blast whose waves could travel twenty thousand feet per second , a blast that was completed before Joe Bob 's stop watch could even start . I studied the photos with fascination as the blast pictured in them grew and grew , preceded by white shock waves . Halfway through the sequence , the explosion began puffing into fantastic shapes , like the cumulus clouds Marion 's brother and I had watched and labeled on that warm spring afternoon at Worthley . The last frame in the photc series was mostly gray and black , with gases and debris enshrouding the eye of the explosion.  | " What do you think , Major ? " asked a technician in a white lab coat . The Major cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his deformed left hand with its missing finger . " Yes , well , I think it 's what we 've been looking for , do n't you , Hal ? " Hal nodded . " I mean the shattering effect is ideal , it seems to me . Look at the size of those shock waves ! " We all stared at the white shock waves greedily , as though they were the billowing breasts of a Playboy centerfold . " Gorgeous ! " Hal said . I , saw Clem only once that summer . I stopped by after work one afternoon and found him in the barnyard standing on the running board of a tractor . He was wearing green work pants and a greasesmearedT-shirt . His dark hair hung in his eyes . He was using a large screwdriver to pry something out of the tractor engine . His face was drenched with sweat , and his T-shirt clung to his scrawny back in dark patches . He smiled when he saw me . I rested my elbows on the hood and looked down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine from Physics 140 , and my knowledge of the human body from Physiology 110 , I described to Clem the similarities between the two : The lungs functioned as a sort of carburetorto mix with oxygen the fuel transported from the stomach via the bloodstream , just as fuel traveling down the gas line from the gas tank mixed with oxygen in the carburetor of an engine ; muscle cells , drawing energy from the combustion of simple sugars , expanded and contracted like the pistons of an engine in order to drive the limbs ... . Clem frowned at me , his screwdriver at rest and his face smeared with dirt and grease . He said with concern , " Shoot , Ginny , you done gone plumb crazy up at Boston . " Fortunately , I no longer cared what Clem thought . I had studied Hegel . I knew that Clem had merely played the antithesis to Joe Bob 's thesis , and that Miss Head was the pure and elevated synthesis . That Miss Head herself might be the thesis for a yet higher synthesis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my return to Worthley in the fall , I went to Miss Head 's apartment to get her to sign my course selection . When she opened her door , she looked just as she had the spring day I had left her to go home for the summer  --  in a tweed suit and nylon blouse ,  |p207her  Greek cameo at her throat and her Swiss watch hanging above her heart . She stared out at me over the top of her horn-rim half glasses and smiled . I felt an impulse to embrace her . My arms rose slightly from my sides . I hastily suppressed the impulse , feeling that Miss Head would be startled and displeased by an expression of physical intimacy from me . Instead , we stood looking at each other awkwardly , beamingwith repressed pleasure . " Come in , come in , " she finally said , stepping aside . She had obviously been working on her Descartes book . Papers were stacked all over her mahogany dining table . " I hope I did n't interrupt you ? " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch and said , " No , indeed . It 's six thirty-five . Time for me to stop anyway . So you 're back , are you ? " " Did you think I would n't be ? " " One never knows . Summer vacations are quite a test . I remember reluctantly going back to Oklahoma every summer . For several months I 'd listen to my parents ' propaganda about how delightful it would be if I 'd forget about my fancy education and settle down with some nice man and give them some grandchildren . By the end of the summer , with another grueling academic year ahead of me , they 'd have me nearly won over . I 'd walk out to the edge of town , where I was usually working as a waitress or a chambermaid or something . I 'd watch the tumbleweed swirl by and the dust clouds sift down over everything , and I 'd struggle with myself over how I wanted to spend my life . Finally , I just stopped going home . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to come back , " I confessed , distressedby my lack of soul . " Good ! I 'm delighted to see you . You look marvelous . You must have had a pleasant summer . " " I did . I worked at my father 's factory . It was fascinating . I 've never properly appreciated him before . " " What kind of factory is it ? " " Munitions , " I replied offhandedly . She lowered her gray head and looked at me over the top of her glasses and said in a deep noncommittal voice , " Indeed . " " You should see the neat photo series they do of explosions in the blast chamber to check detonation speeds . " " What are these explosives for , as it were ? "  | " Bombs and shells and stuff . " " Indeed . " She looked at me strangely . " Well , he just makes them . He 's presented with a chemical problem : how to maximize shock waves within a given number of microseconds . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Head said nothing . " Well , is it ? " " I would n't know , I 'm sure . I 'm strictly apolitical , Miss Babcock . I happen to agree with Descartes when he says that his maxim is ' to try always to conquer himself rather than fortune , and to alter his desires rather than change the order of the world , and generally accustom himself to believe that there is nothing entirely within his power but his own thoughts . ' I 've always felt that a person 's intelligenceis directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic . " I thought about it . I was n't absolutely positive that I agreed with Descartes in this case . But if Miss Head agreed , I was sure I 'd come to in time . " Well , anyhow , I need your signature . " " Let me see , " she said , taking my schedule . I was pleased with myself for having decided what to take without her advice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanched . What was wrong with it ? " I had thought , " she said , sounding somewhat miffed , " that you might want to do some independent study under me on Descartes or Spinoza . " " Well , I did think about it . And then I decided that I 'd better cover some more ground in a rather superficial fashion before I zero in on any one specialty . " " That 's probably an excellent idea . But how about eighteenthcenturymusic , say , or the early English novel ? " " Well , I do n't know , I mean , I 'd like to take them , but I ca n't take everything , can I ? " " No , but I really do n't think you 'll be happy with the **29;2675;TOOLONG , Miss Babcock . They 're quite different from Descartes and Spinoza , you know . Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and Kierkegaard , indeed ! " She snorted so forcefully that her glasses popped off and dangled on their chain . " And in combination with your other choices  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Babcock . As your adviser , I feel I must warn you . "  | " But why , Miss Head ? I do n't understand . " I was truly perplexed . I had expected her to be pleased that I had made up my own mind this time . " It 's too much at once , " she explained mysteriously . " I 'm the one who has to take these courses , Miss Head , and these are the ones I want to take . I can switch at mid-term if they 're not what I want . And I definitely plan to take your Descartes seminar in Janu-ary . " She looked at me , at a loss . Never having been a mother , she was new to the battles of will that went on constantly between parent and child . Finally , she signed the form and handed it to me . " Thank you , Miss Head , " I said , standing up . " You 're welcome , I 'm sure , Miss Babcock , " she replied coolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule and fill out a new one entirely in keeping with her wishes . If I did n't please this woman , she would withdraw her affection and support . On the other hand , if I did n't please myself , I might end up like my mother , sacrificed to others ' whims for so long that I 'd no longer know what I wanted . And what other message had I been deciphering from Miss Head 's exampleall these months : I was n't doomed to repeat my mother 's patterns of behavior . There were alternatives . Struggling in the grip of this paradox , I managed to say to Miss Head with equal iciness , " It 's very nice seeing you again . " She nodded her gray-bunned head slightly and offered me a pained smile . Again I wanted to embrace her , to reassure myself of her continuing affection in spite of it all . Again I stopped myself . I had to steady myself against the wall with one hand as I passed through her alcove and into the hall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a small garret on the fifth floor with a window seat overlooking the courtyard . It smelled musty . I threw open the casement windows and looked toward the lake , past the bronze cast of Artemis on whose outstretched finger someone had hung a yo-yo . There was a crash and a clatter , and I heard a voice in the next room shout , " Oh fuck ! " A tin can was falling through the air . Turning slowly , end over end , it spewed a red liquid onto the gray flagstones and the Flemish sundial in the courtyard below . There was another clatter next door , and the same coarse voicep210yelled , " Goddam it to hell ! " The can landed with a hollow crunch . As it lay there , the red liquid oozed from the holes in its top . The stones all around it and the bronze sundial were splattered with rusty red dribbles , as though some wild animal had been dismembering its prey on that very spot . " Shit , shit , shit ! " the voice roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked tentatively at her door . " Yeah ? " I looked in . " Are you okay ? " The girl was wearing wheat jeans and a black turtleneck jersey , which fitted snugly around her large breasts . She was tall , big , statuesque . Her thick brown hair was plaited in a single braid down her back . Her features were coarse  --  a wide forehead , a large nose , prominent cheekbones . They had a plasticity that gave her face a startling expressiveness . In the few seconds between my opening her door and speaking to her , a phenomenal range of emotions had flitted across her face  --  surprise , embarrassment , irritation , curiosity . " Are you okay ? " " I did n't know anyone but me was on the hall yet . " " I just got here . I guess we 're neighbors . I 'm Ginny Babcock . " " Edna Holzer . Eddie . " I recognized the name . She was a junior , an editor on the campus newspaper . I glanced around her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a day or two . There were playbills and a Bob Dylan poster plastered across one wall , a Mexican blanket on another , a guitar propped in a corner , some small clay sculptures sitting on the college-issue desk and on the window seat . " What happened  --  the crashing and the yelling ? " " I knocked over a can of tomato juice . I keep stuff for breakfast on my outside window ledge . For the mornings when I oversleep and miss breakfast . Which is often . " " Oh . I see . Well , nice to meet you . See you later , I imagine , " I said , withdrawing from her room . " Glad you 're all right . That tomato juice splattering all over everything looked like blood . " She looked at me with interest . " Did you think so ? " I felt as though I 'd just unwittingly handed her the key to my character . " Where are you from , Ginny ? " " Tennessee . " The look of disgust that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abeyance until now , came over her face . " Christ , you southerners make me sick . " " Why ? " I asked in amazement at this unprovoked assault . Have you been reading the papers ? Those civil rights workers getting murdered and buried in the levees ? Jesus , are there really such morons down there ? " " We 're not much different from people up here . We just sound different . Well , see you around , Eddie . I 've got to get back to my unpacking . " I stomped from her room , amazed to find myself suddenlyfunctioning as an ambassador from the South . The next morning I met my neighbor on the other side  --  a freshmanfrom Iowa named Bev Martin . She was tall and bony and awkward , with wide panicked eyes that shifted like a frightened rabbit 's . She spoke in a near whisper . High strung , I labeled her . She and Eddie and I made good neighbors : We left each other strictly alone . Bev and I studied continuously , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always working on editorials for the newspaper  --  proposing trade embargoes on South Africa , demanding that the collegesell its defense industry stocks , insisting that birth control pills be dispensed by the desiccated spinsters at the college infirmary . Or sculpting in a studio at the arts center . I also learned that she was on a scholarship and earned her spending money by playing her guitar in a coffee house in Cambridge . When she had time to do things like reading assignments and papers , I never found out . Perhaps she did n't do them , and persuaded me to drop out of Worthley with her at the end of that year merely because she was going to be thrown out anyway . But I 'm getting ahead of myself . One night I was lying on my bed reading in my physics text that , due to tidal friction , the rotation of the earth was slowing down by ten to fifteen microseconds a day . On a scratch pad I was trying to estimate how long it would take for the rotation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun side to reach the boiling point , when my door crashed open and in strolled Eddie Holzer in her wheat jeans and turtleneck . " You might at least knock , " I said sourly , irritated at being interruptedin my calculation of the apocalypse . " Oh , excuse me , were you masturbating ? " I flushed scarlet . " You do masturbate , do n't you ? No ? You really should try it . I recommend it highly . It relieves all sorts of tensions . Or do you have a regular man ? "  |p212I  pulled myself together and notified her primly , " I 'm not interested in that sort of thing . " " You 're not ? What are you interested in ? " she asked , flopping down familiarly on the foot of my bed . " Knowledge , truth , stuff like that . " " You say that as though it 's something you can go out and buy in a package . " " Well , you can , in a way . You can buy books that contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of transferring information from the pages of a book into your head ? " " More or less . " " How quaint ! " " I do n't see what 's quaint about it . It 's just a question of being able to find enough uninterrupted time to be able to absorb it all . " " Yeah . All right . I get you , " she snapped , standing up . " I just wanted to ask if you 'd take part in a Fast for Freedom tomorrow night . For each student who skips supper , Worthley will give fifty cents to the fund to bus black children out of Roxbury to white schools . " " Do I have any choice ? " " Of course you have a choice . You either go to dinner or you do n't . I 'm just asking you not to . " " Actually , I think I 'll go to dinner . You see , I 'm apolitical . I agree with Descartes when he says his maxim is ' to try always to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than change the order of the world , and generally act ustom himself to believe that there is nothing entirely within his power but his own thoughts . ' " I had memorized word for word the quote first presented to me by Miss Head . " Descartes ! Do you think I give a shit what Descartes says ? If my eyes were rotting in my skull from disuse , I would n't read Descartes . That fascist son of a bitch ! " " Politics is nothing but personal opinion , " I replied disdainfully . " For every person who agrees with your editorials about busing children out of Roxbury , you 'll find an equal number who disagree . And for equally logical reasons . Maybe not here at Worthley , where it 's high fashion to be liberal , but certainly in the outside world . " " I never said the world is n't full of fascists . That 's why those of us who are n't have to speak out . " " What makes you so sure your opinions are correct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opinions . I 'm interested in Truth ! - " Truth ! Truth ! Ginny , you 're priceless , just priceless . Really you are . And Descartes is Truth ? " " Descartes at least has the intellectual humility to limit his pronouncementsto areas in which he can discern the truth , rather than mouthing off irresponsible opinions about every topic under the sun . " " That I-think-therefore-I-am crap ? " " I do n't see that it 's crap , ' as you so inelegantly call it . It happens to be as verifiable as a mathematical proof . " " Have you read any Nietzsche yet ? " " I 'm reading him this term . " " Read what Nietzsche has to say about your precious Descartes . You 've been hanging out with that Head chick , have n't you ? " She shook her braided head sadly . " Miss Head is a friend of mine . What of it ? " Eddie sighed with pity . " You 're hopeless . I bet you even go for that Hegelian thesis-antithesis garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary . " " Who asked you ? " I shot back as she vanished out my door . Never did I enjoy a Worthley meal more than supper the next night  --  me and Miss Head and half a dozen insistently apolitical others , all alone in the vast echoing dining hall under the gaze of the medieval gargoyles that ringed the pillars . At one point Eddie appeared in the doorway and rapidly jotted down all our names . However , after dinner , I did hesitantly look up in Beyond Good and Evil what Nietzsche had to say about Descartes : There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are " immediate certainties " ; for instance , " I think . " . . . They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold , pure , divinely indifferent dialectic . . . whereas , in fact , a prejudiced proposition , idea , or " suggestion , " which is generally their heart 's desire abstracted and refined , is defended by them with arguments sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is experienced " I think , " I find a whole series of daring assertions , the argumentative proof of which would be difficult , perhaps impossible : for instance , that it is I who think , that there must necessarily be something that thinks , that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause , that there is an " ego , " and finally , that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking  --  that I know what thinking is . For if I had not already decidedp214within myself what it is , by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps " willing " or " feeling " ? I leapt up enraged at ( although unable to refute ) this attack on the noble Descartes . I threw open my door and stalked to Eddie 's and hurled it open with a crash . Peter , Paul and Mary 's " Blowing in the Wind " blared out from her record player . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw me and said in a fair imitation of a southern drawl , " Way-ell , if hit in'nt mah li ' 1 southren buddy ! " When I did n't smile , and when my face remained contorted with rage , she added with concern , " Is something wrong ? " " Yes ! Something very definitely is wrong . I just read what that bastard Nietzsche has to say about Descartes . " She grinned knowingly . " What do you think about it ? " Deciding that creeps like Eddie had to be dealt with on their own terms , I snarled , " I think it sucks . " Eddie positively beamed . " It sucks , huh ? Do you know what that means  --  ' to suck ' ? " I glared at her . " I do n't know why you 're always so goddam patronizing to me . You seem to think I 'm some kind of naive belle or something . Yes , I know what ' to suck ' means . " Presumably , that was what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up in the bomb shelter . " What do you think of it ? " " Of what ? " " Of sucking . " " What does that have to do with Descartes ? " " Absolutely nothing ! " she declared triumphantly . " That 's my whole point . I suck , therefore I am . What do you think ? " " Man happens to be more than  --  " " Man  --  shit ! l do n't even talk to people who try to tell me what man ' is or is n't . If you want to talk about some one particular action of one particular person , okay . But do n't hand me any of this pompous Mankind is this or that ' garbage because I 'm not interested . Go see your Miss Head . " She turned back to her desk . I skulked to my room and brooded on into the night . The citadels constructed by Miss Head were clearly under attack . Miss Head left a note in my mailbox inviting me to a production of Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much since the termp215began because I was n't taking one of her courses , and because we were both so busy otherwise . So I accepted with delight . We met in the downstairs hall . She looked almost pretty , despite her gray bun and her shapeless loden coat . In my pleasure at seeing her , I reached out and hugged her with one arm . She stiffened and drew back , blushing and searching for her watch underneath her coat . " My car 's outside . We 're late . We 'd better rush . " Even being late did n't prevent my inspecting the back floor of her car for hidden murderers , as the Major had always advised . On the way to the opera , we took a wrong turn . As we wound through strange streets , the neighborhood got more and more seedy . Trash filled the gutters , and the shop fronts needed painting . The MTA rumbled past on grimy overhead tracks , and the people on the streets were mostly black . I realized that we were in Roxbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of busing schoolchildrenout of here . " I do n't know , " I said hesitantly . " Maybe we should have fasted that night . This is a pretty grim setting for children , do n't you think ? " Miss Head glanced at me impatiently . " Please spare me your sentimentalizing , Miss Babcock . You 've clearly been reading too many editorials by that Holzer girl . " " Well , but do n't you find it a little depressing ? " We were driving down a block of crumbling row houses , where a group of black children were poking with sticks at candy wrappers and newspapers that floated sluggishly in the murky water around a clogged gutter drain . " You ca n't generalize . Squalid circumstances can sometimes produceoutstanding achievers . " She was clearly referring to herself and her Dust Bowl origins . " Well , you got out of Morgan . But what about those who did n't ? " " My childhood friends are n't unhappy with their lives . Or not any more so than anyone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But is n't that in itself a shame ? That they were never exposed to any other possibilities for themselves ? " " What makes you so sure that Worthley beats Morgan ? " she asked with a faint ironic smile . " It is so condescending of you , Miss Babcock . It shows a basic lack of respect for the dignity of people different from yourself . That 's what irritates me so much about Miss Holzer 's half/baked editorials . It never occurs to her that there might be anything in Roxbury for the children of value equivalent to a white middle-class education . " " But I have n't said that Worthley beats Morgan . Or Hullsport . If you 'll recall , I did n't even want to leave Hullsport . I had to be dragged up here by my father . But you , Miss Head , have said that Worthley beats Morgan . " " For me , as I am now , it does , " she said patiently . " But if I had stayed in Morgan , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Morgan would suit me better . " " A better person than you are now ? " " I did n't say better or worse , I said different . Really , Miss Babcock , you must work on your objectivity . It 's nonsense using words like ' good ' and ' bad . ' What happens happens . That 's not your con-cern . " " You mean no one course of action is any better or worse than another ? " I demanded , scandalized to see where Miss Head 's line of thought  --  and mine insofar as I had taken her as my mentor  --  was leading . " Courses of action are n't your concern , Miss Babcock . Your concernis to understand , to locate th , ' Truth in a situation . Which is done , as Spinoza told you last year if you were paying attention , by stilling your emotions , your passions , and functioning as an instrument of pure thought . Detachment is everything , Miss Babcock , believe me . Evil is always with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , according as they delight or offend human senses , or accordingas they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind .... Matter was not lacking to God for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest . The laws of His nature are so vast as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence . ' " " But Miss Head , I do n't know if I agree with that . I mean , look what Nietzsche says about the possibility of there even being such a thing as detachment or ' pure thought . ' " She blanched in the dim street light through the car window . " Well , of course , if you 're going to fall under the spell of that miserableneurotic mystic , there 's not a great deal that Descartes can do for you , Miss Babcock . Do you know that Mussolini adored Nietzsche ? No , of course you do n't . I 'd look into Nietzsche 's pedigree before enrolling myself under his banner if I were you , Miss Babcock. "  |p217I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detachment , Miss Head was sounding suspiciously angry . During the opera , I developed a special sympathy for the poor dwarfs who were being whipped to shreds by the wicked Alberich . They were so small that his demands  --  that they mine minerals for him with their minuscule picks  --  were impossible to fulfill . Yet they struggledon faithfully and industriously . My heart went out t'a them . I imagined that Eddie , had she been there , would have leapt onto the stage and started unionizing them . Beads of sweat were popping out on my upper lip as I strained with them in their agony . Miss Head leaned over and whispered , " Notice the incessant recurrence of the dwarfs ' leitmotif , the ways in which its tonal structurehints at the futility of their attempts . " I gritted my teeth and whirled toward her . Miss Head was serenely watching the stage over the tops of her lenses , and was nodding slightly to the rhythm of the leitmotif . When I went into Eddie 's room the next night , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared out among stacks of newspapers , playing her guitar and singing " Mr. Tambourine Man . " She saw me and nodded pleasantly but kept on singing , determined to finish out the song . She had a very appealing husky alto singing voice . I glanced around the room . There was a new reddish clay model of something or other sitting on her bookcase . I walked over to it . Two nude women were lying on their sides facing each other . Their arms were wrapped around each other , and their legs were entwined . On both faces were expressions of ecstasy . Finishing the song with a loud self-mocking strum , Eddie laid the guitar on the stacks of paper and stood up and stretched her statuesque body languidly like a cat . " Do you like it ? " she asked me , nodding toward the model . " I just finished it . " " Uh , yes . The pattern of the lines is fascinating . " " Yes , I know . It 's brilliant technically . But what I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . It 's very nice . " " How do you feel about the subject matter ? " Detaching myself in my best Spinozan fashion from the fleeting sense of panic I 'd felt upon first seeing it , I said calmly , " I feel it 's a valid form of sexual expression . After all , Freud says that man is essentially bisexual and is channeled in one direction or the other by his conditioning . "  | " Screw Freud and screw that ' man is ' crap . What emotions doesthis particular clay model elicit from you , Ginny Babcock ? " I drew a deep breath . " Well , frankly , Eddie , I 'm not very interested in sexuality in any of its forms . " " I see . " " I had too much inept sex at too early an age , and I 'm fed up with it , that 's all . I have more important things to think about . " " Indeed , " Eddie said gravely , tucking in her chin and looking out over imaginary glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , " she asked brightly , " would you be interested in signing my petition to President Johnson demanding that he end our military involvement in southeast Asia ? " " Why do you bother asking me when you know what I 'll say ? " " Just trying to give you a chance to save your soul . " " Thanks , but no thanks . " " Why not ? Do n't you want to save your soul ? " " You say it 's a civil war and we should n't interfere . My father says it 's the vanguard of the s orld-wide Communist take-over and has to be nipped in the bud . You feel sorry for the innocent people who are being maimed and killed by American troops . He feels sorry for the innocent people who are getting other people 's theories crammed into their brains , and who are being maimed and killed by Communist troops . How do I know which of you is right ? " " Which do you feel is right ? " " Neither . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in fact , not opinion . I happen to feel that the degree of a person 's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting attitudes she can bring to bear on the same topic , " I announced , resolutely parroting Miss Head . " Intelligence , garbage ! You 're talking about paralysis , moral paralysis ! The way you live your life is a political act , whether you like it or not . You 're taking a stand by the very fact of refusing to take a stand . " For several moments , we glared at each other with ideological contempt . " But to what elevated purpose do I owe the honor of your presence in my humble garret ? " Eddie asked . " Well , actually , I came in to ask how the Roxbury busing is going . " She glanced at me quickly . " What 's it to you , fascist ? " " I went through Roxbury last night on the way to the opera withp219Miss Head , and I sort of saw your point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more yardage later . " Big of you . It 's going quite well , no thanks to you and your Miss Head . " " But I do have a question , " I said innocently . Eddie raised her hands , palms up , and bowed her head to indicate that her ears were at my service . " Do n't you think it 's patronizing of you to assume that our way of life is so superior to theirs , that they should be given the opportunity to ape us ? " I was hoping against hope that Eddie would n't have an answer for this argument of Miss Head 's . Eddie shrugged impatiently . " It 's patronizing to want to give someone the skills and attitudes necessary to earn enough money so that his children wo n't have to be gnawed by rats when they go to sleep at night ? " " But do n't you think that the cream will rise to the top anyway ? " " Perhaps . But a lot of perfectly adequate whole milk goes sour in the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Roxbury are n't just as content with their lives as people anywhere else ? " " I 'll tell you how I know , " she said , turning on me with fervor . " I know because I grew up in a slum in Boston . Do you know who my father was ? " I hesitated , feeling as though I should know . So many people here had diplomats , famous academicians , important businessmen for fathers . Holzer . Holzer . Who was Eddie 's father , and why on earth would he have raised her in a Boston slum ? " No , I do n't . " " Well , we 're even . I do n't either . He was a rapist . He dragged my mother into a cellar hole and stuffed a rag in her mouth and tied her wrists with his belt and beat her black and blue and then raped her . " I stared at her with horror . " I 'm  --  sorry . " " Oh , I 'm not , " Eddie said harshly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be here , would I ? Or at least not in my current configuration . But your cream rising bit is crap . Cream does n't rise under constantagitation , or when the fucking bottle is smashed to bits . " " But it does , " I insisted , holding out my hand illustratively . " Look at you . " " You know why I 'm at Worthley ? I 'm here because one lousy teacher at that hellhole where I went to school took a special interest in me and loaded me down with books and devoted herself to my progress . But there were n't enough of her to go around . In fact , I wasp220the only one in my whole class who benefited like that . " She looked at me defiantly , waiting to see what sort of half-baked notions I would come up with next for her to refute from her position of superior experience . " Well ! I guess that only proves my point  --  that rational people stay clear of politics . I mean , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until all the facts are in  --  and how many situations are like that in life ? " " Rubbish ! " Eddie shrieked . " Reactionary rubbish ! Your head is just packed full of shit by that Head bitch , Ginny ! Go ahead , model yourself after her ! Spend your life with a clock tacked to your boob  --  ev . rything safe and neat and orderly . No risks , therefore no mistakes.1 ' No mate , no children , no animals to interfere with her precious schedules . Her cello to wrap her legs around when she 's lonely , and her magnum opus on Descartes to occupy her busy little brain . Ideal , you would say . So go ahead ! " " It 's not such a bad life she has . It beats the hell out of careening from one disaster to the next , as I did before I came to Worthley . " " It 's not so bad if you do n't mind a living death . " " You 're so goddam self-righteous ! " I gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superior to hers ? " " I do n't think , I know . I know that plunging into involvements with other people , and risking rejection and ridicule in a good cause is better than self-embalmment . The only passion Miss Head has ever experienced in her life is her passion for certainty a la Descartes and Spinoza . " " Well , I happen not to know what constitutes a ' good cause , ' Eddie , and that 's why I 'm apolitical . Look at all the atrocities that have been committed in the name of good causes . I 'll stick , along with Miss Head , to areas in which I do ' know . ' " She shook her head , her braid lashing in disgust . " But you do n't know . You only think you know . You think , therefore you know . Ha ! " " Even if I were to admit to being convinced by Nietzsche 's remarks , which I 'm not doing , there are other areas of knowledge that are unquestionable facts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Like the fact that a second is 1/31,556,925.9747 's of the orbital year that began at noon on January 1 , 1900 . And the fact that you can take this fact , and with it construct other facts called minutes , hours ,  |p221days  , years . Like the fact that an atom is constructed of positive charges called protons and negative charges called electrons , and that if they are combined in a designated manner , you will always get a certain element . " Eddie shook her head and said , " And so you do n't have to be involved with other people because you 're so busy tracking down these important truths ? Well , if you say so . But do you know that there 's a culture in India that happens to use as its basic time unit the period required to boil a pot of rice ? And they seem to get along all right . " I turned around and stormed out , slamming her door . I charged down the hall , got into the rickety elevator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception hall and past the rows of imposing portraits and under the vaulted stone archway . I pounded on Miss Head 's massive door . She opened it , holding her cello in one hand . " Oh , Miss Babcock , it 's only you . Good heavens , I thought it was at least a fire warning . Come in , come in . " I marched in and sank down on the horsehair loveseat . " Whatever is the matter ? " I breathed deeply , trying to relax . " Would you like some tea ? I just made some . " " Yes , thank you . With lemon , please . " What Eddie had said about Miss Head simply was n't true . She had involved herself with other people  --  with me , for instance . Never mind that she had ulterior motives . Miss Head leaned her cello against a chair and sat down at her Queen Anne tea table and poured from her encrusted silver urn . " Now ! What brings you here so late at night ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , it 's perfectly all right . I was just playing some Vivaldi . " " Is it too late to change out of nineteeth-century philosophy and into your advanced Descartes seminar for this term ? " " Hmmm , " she said , glancing at me shrewdly , forcing herself not to say " I told you so . " " Well , it is a little late . I mean the term 's half over , is n't it ? But let me think about it . It helps that I happen to be your class dean , your adviser , and the professor of the seminar you want to get into , does n't it ? But it is a highly irregular request . Most unusual indeed .... " " I 'd really appreciate it , Miss Head . I think Nietzsche 's getting me down . " To say nothing of his disciple Eddie Holzer.  | " Indeed , " she said . " Indeed . Yes , I know exactly what you mean . Well , I 'll give you my decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She set down her teacup and unleashed her metronome at a dizzyingrate . Then she picked up her cello , fitted it between her knees , and filled her chambers with a driving rendition of sections of " The Four Seasons . " I followed the straightforward themes and variations with ease and was soon feeling much better . The polished red cello gleamed mellowly in the dim light from a converted oil lamp . Outside her windows , blue icicles hung from the gutter like stalactites . " Thank you , Miss Head , " I said , as I was setting down my cup and preparing to leave . " I needed that . " I felt as serene now as a harried housewife after her morning dose of Librium . " You 're quite welcome , Miss Babcock . Any time . Within reason . " That Wednesday as I sat in the dining hall eating chop suey , Eddie sauntered up with her lunch tray and began unloading her dishes next to mine . I acknowledged her with a cold nod . I , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her wheat jeans and turtleneck and Goliath sandals , her messy braid with strands of straggly hair escaping  --  objectionable , aesthetically offensive . " Well , and how 's the grande dame of Castle Court ? " " Are you referring to me ? " I inquired with dignity . " Yup , to you , sweetheart . How ya doin ? " " Fine , until your arrival , thank you . " " Oh , come on , Ginny . We have many more tedious months next door to each other . Let 's be civil , okay ? " " It 's all right with me . If you 'll recall , you were the one who started us off on this note just now when you referred to me as a grande dame . " " All right . Yes . You 're right . I apologize . Look , I need your help . " " What ? " I asked , surprised at the notion that she could need anything from me . " Some friends of mine are doing an experiment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you volunteer ? It 'll just take half an hour in one of the labs . " " Well , I do n't know . . . . I have a paper due and  --  " " Please . " " All right , " I said , delighted to have the notorious Eddie Holzer begging me for something . After lunch , we walked through the courtyard en route to thep223psychology labs . Eddie stopped and studied the bronze sundial with its ornate leaves and vines and reclining gods and goddesses . Its scrolled gnomon cast a shadow at 2:15 . " My God ! " I exclaimed . " Two fifteen ? I have an appointment with Miss Head at two thirty . " She was going to give me the word on her Descartes seminar . Eddie laughed . " Do n't panic , kid . It 's not two fifteen . This fucking thing is Flemish . It 's set for the latitude of Flanders . " When we got to the lab , Eddie 's friends were already there  --  several juniors and seniors , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote and directed and acted in the plays , who wrote and edited the paper and the literary magazine . They all looked identical to Eddie in their wheat jeans and turtlenecks and sandals , with long straight hair or braids . I felt instantly intimidated in my Helena Head tweed suit and bun . " We 're all here now , " said a tall , dark hunched senior who had a painting exhibit in the arts center at that very moment . The psychologyproject was apparently hers . Eddie and I and two others sat side by side ; the senior and another girl stood in front of us . A third girl sat in the corner taking notes . The senior explained the rules . She herself would hold up a constantcontrol card made of cardboard . The other girl up front would hold up a succession of cards of different lengths . One at a time , we four subjects were to say whether the second card was longer than , shorter than , or the same length as the control card . It seemed simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't believe that these hypercreative upperclassmen could n't come up with more intriguing ways to spend their time . After several practice runs , the experiment began in earnest . I was sitting on the far end and was always the last to express my judgment , but it really did n't matter because we all agreed anyway . Yes , yes , that card was shorter than the control . And that one was longer . And so on . I was becoming very impatient and irritable . After all , I did have a paper to write . During the sixth round the atmosphere of bored agreement suddenlyshifted , and I found the three others blandly agreeing that a card was shorter , which to me was obviously longer . And again . " Longer , " said the first girl . " Longer , " agreed the second . " Longer , " said Eddie with a yawn.  | " The same , " I insisted staunchly . And yet again . I kept glancing around furtively as the others perjured with indifference the testimony of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same , " said the first girl . " The same . " " The same , " agreed Eddie . " Longer , " I mumbled belligerently . Damn ! How could they call it the same , when it was so obviously longer ? " Shorter , " said the first girl . " Shorter , " said the second . " Shorter , " said Eddie , stretching luxuriously . " The same ? " I suggested uncertainly . It could n't be shorter . Could it ? The others glanced at me with surprise . " Longer , " said the first girl , about a card that to me was clearly shorter . " Longer , " confirmed the second girl . " Longer , " agreed Eddie . Unable to endure the social isolation any longer , I intentionally belied the verdict of my eyes and said casually , " Longer . " It felt marvelous to be in step with the others . I breathed a deep sigh of relief . " The same , " said the first girl . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wailed pitifully . Was something wrong with my eyes ? I squinted and then opened them as wide as possible , trying to rectify my apparently faulty vision . Then I stared so intently at the control card that my vision blanked out altogether and I could n't see anything for a few seconds . Eddie and the first girl looked at me , then glanced at each other and shrugged . After two dozen of these runs , in which they agreed and I differed , or in which they agreed and I pretended to agree , interspersed with runs in which we all genuinely did agree , I could no longer tell what was shorter or longer than what . I would see a card as shorter . The others would call it longer , and before my very eyes the card would quiver and expand until it did in fact look longer . Or it would waver playfully back and forth between long and short . Soon I was feeling nauseated , and my eyes were burning.  | " The same , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer to me . " The same , " said the second . " The same , " said Eddie . I widened and narrowed my eyes several times , as the size of the card fluctuated . Then I fell out of my chair and collapsed on the floor , sobbing . Eddie knelt down and helped me up , saying , " Now , now Ginny . It 's just an experiment . Where 's your Spinozan detachment ? " I collapsed on her shoulder and wept while she patted my back consolingly . The senior running the test came up and said , " You really did quite well , Ginny . You stood up to the others sixty-five percent of the time . The average so far is forty-three percent . " " What average ? " I asked between sobs , looking up . " The average number of correct responses the subject gives in contradiction to the pretend subjects . " " Pretend subjects ? You mean this whole thing was staged ? " I turned on Eddie in a rage . " We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior said . " You mean you had n't ? " I raised a fist to slug Eddie . She put an arm around me affectionately . I pulled away . " I 'm sorry , Ginny , but it had to be done , " Eddie said . " Why did it ? You could have at least told me . " " If I 'd told you , it would n't have worked , would it ? And you are in search of Truth , are n't you ? Or does n't that extend to the truth about yourself ? " I stomped out of the lab , my vision so strained and blurred that I bumped into the door casing . Back on my hall , I went to the bathroomand threw up . Then I went to my room and drew the curtains and climbed in bed and pulled the covers over my head . I stayed there until the following day , missing my appointment with Miss Head and several classes as well . Christmas vacation came and went . Mid-winter faded into early spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivulets . Still I had n't spoken to Eddie . She had humiliated me in front of her artsy friends . I knew they were snickering behind their hands about the weakness of my character as I passed them en route to the library or to classes . I had decided never to speak to Eddie again . When Ip226encountered her in the dining hall or as we entered our rooms , I turned my head away . She respected my pique and did n't make any effort to approach me . Sometimes I heard her in her room singing Bob Dylan songs . Occasionally I would deign to read one of her ridiculous editorials in the campus paper demanding that the college government abolish curfew , that the trustees run a camp for ghetto children on the campus in the summer . A couple of times when I was sure she was out , I crept through her sloppy room and out her casementwindow to a flat roof where I could sunbathe nude and undisturbedin the late April sun . Mostly , though , I studied . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes and at meals . I was too busy pursuing Truth to have a social life . Under Miss Head 's tutelage I was exploring the topic of free will versus determinism as handled by the **28;2706;TOOLONG philosophers . Determinism was winning out hands down . I was pleased . I was making mincemeat of Eddie 's principles of social action . Otherwise , however , my courses were not going well . Schopenhauerin Philosophy 240 was saying distressing things like , " No truth therefore is more certain , more independent of all others , and less in need of proof than this , that all that exists for knowledge , and thereforefor this whole world , is only object in relation to subject , perceptionof a perceiver , in a word , idea . This is obviously true of the past and the future , as well as of the present , of what is farthest off , as of what is near ; for it is true of time and space themselves , in which alone these distinctions arise . All that in any way belongs or can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , and exists only for the subject . The world is idea . " In astronomy I was going to the observatory every night and watching a galaxy group called the Hydra cluster ; the light I was viewing had left there two billion years earlier . In short , I was looking at the past . The concept unnerved me . With outrage I studied the red shift of its spectrum , which indicated that the galaxy was moving away from me at the rate of 38,000 miles per second . And in physics I was studying the subatomic particles  --  mesons and neutrinos  --  whose existence was proved only by the wakes of tiny bubbles they left as they shot through liquid hydrogen . Some were too short-lived to do even that , with life spans of ten millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a second . I brooded over the vast range of electromagnetic radiations onp227either side of the tiny band that could be discerned by human sense organs . They made me absolutely furious . But the last straw was Einstein 's theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted on , that its perceived duration shifted in relation to the orientation in space and motion of the perceiver . Suddenly I was surrounded by modern science with forces and particles I could n't see or hear or taste or feel . I felt bombarded  --  by a hundred different kinds of electromagnetic waves and subatomic particles , by fractions of time too minute to measure , by light rays that had left their source before life even existed on earth . All these things were showering down on me . Yet Lord Kelvin had promised me certainty in return for studying physics . " When you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers , you know something about it , " he had said in introductory physics last year . I felt betrayed . In the depths of my despair , who should arrive at my door but Bev Martin , my next-door neighbor , the freshman from Iowa . I had scarcely seen her the entire year  --  a few times when I had been up at dawn to finish a paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake shore in a navy sweat suit jogging through the snow , bathed in the purple sunrise . I at least saw Miss Head occasionally . Bev saw no one . Which was why I was startled when she appeared in my room for a chat that evening as I was agonizing over a chart on the age of the universe , the Milky Way galaxy , our sun , the earth : according to it , mankind was too recent an arrival even to merit mention . I was sick with indignation . I looked up impatiently , waiting to find out what Bev wanted from me , a miserable mote stirred up by Eternity 's spring cleaning . " I wondered if you 'd like to go into town with me for supper tonight . " She was blushing and looking at the floor , and chewing her chapped lower lip . Her eyes were wide and terrified . It was obviously difficult for her to ask me . But I said promptly , through gritted teeth , " I 'm sorry , Bev , but I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow and I have n't finished it . " " Oh . Okay . " But thanks . Some other time maybe . " " Sure . " She scuttled out . That night as I was preparing to go to bed , I walked across the hall to the bathroom . Inside , I glanced under the stall doors , to be surep228there were no concealed rapists , as Mother had taught me to do at an early age . The door of the bathtub enclosure caught my eye . Behind it an arm hung almost to the floor . I pushed open the door . Slumped in a chair beside the tub was Bev . She smiled up at me weakly , her hyperthyroidal eyes glazed over . A Miltown bottle lay on the floor next to her . I picked it up . It was empty . I looked back and forth between Bev and the bottle . I considered the topic of suicide . Suicide : On the one hand , it could be regarded as a plea for help . After all , why had Bev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would have found her for weeks ? A person attempting suicide , in the view of many specialists , did n't really want to die , but was rather adopting this desperate tactic as the only remainingmeans of exerting an impact on an unresponsive environment . It was only a passing aberration . Thwarted , the person would in many cases go on to live a long and productive life . Bev slumped lower in the chair . Her eyes were half shut . On the other hand , a person 's life belonged to her alone , and she had the right to end it if she so chose . Robbing someone of this right , stifling this expression of a person 's desire for greater autonomy , might very well deprive that person of the self-respect essential to the conduct of an existentially meaningful existence . Interfering in someone 's suicide while claiming to be concerned for that person 's well-being might actually be undertaken solely to spare the rescuer from having to confront doubts about the value of his own existence .... Bev fell onto the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatry that felt . . . . Eddie walked in in her bathrobe . She bent over the sink to brush her teeth . But then she stood back up and stared at me in the doorway of the tub stall . Walking over , she took in the situation in one quick glance  --  Bev slumped on the floor , the empty bottle in my hand . Looking at me for a moment in disbelief , she raced from the bathroom . When she returned , she pushed me aside and knelt beside Bev . She slapped her face hard several times and soon had her sitting up and drinking glass after glass of warm salt water . Before long , the entire floor of the stall , and Eddie and Bev as well , were splattered with vomit . A couple of doctors arrived and whisked Bev off to the infirmary . I went to bed and pulled the covers over my head . I dreamed thatp229night of the seashore . Miss Head in a tweed suit was sitting on the sand in a carved Victorian chair with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she nodded her gray bun in time . She played Handel 's " Water Music " on her cello . As she played , the waves broke rhythmically and washed up around her feet . Her chair , her cello , and she herself were sinking into the sand . The breaking waves consisted of dilute blood . Occasionally , along with seaweed and shells and fluorescent blue Portuguese men-of-war , the waves would toss up a mangled human limb or a staring eyeball . Miss Head observedthese without interest and never missed a beat . The next morning in nineteenth-century philosophy we studied Schopenhauer 's remarks from The World as Will and Idea : " We must , without reserve , regard all presented objects , even our own bodies , merely as ideas , and call them merely ideas . " In physics the next period we busied ourselves with the concept that all objects , organic and inorganic , were merely empty space with trillions of particles chasing each other through the void , and that even these " particles , " taken a step further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to skip lunch . I had lost my appetite , possibly forever . As I walked to the biology lab , where I had n't been since the previous year , I re-created in my mind the picture of Bev slumped over in her chair with me watching her , paralyzed . I tried regarding the scene as merely an idea originating in my own isolated brain , as Schopenhauer suggested . Then I tried dissecting it into energy waves and probability functions . Neither exercise worked . I continued to tremble with guilt and horror  --  at not making time for Bev when she asked me to , and at my subsequent paralysis in the face of her despair . No one was in the lab . I put on a white coat . I took a bacteria smear from a Petri dish and dyed a small portion of it . Then I slipped the slide under a microscope . I watched as the stained bacteria fluttered and shuddered trying to assimilate the poison dye . After a valiant struggle , one by one the contaminated cells released the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digest foreign cells , thereby destroying themselves . I shifted the slide to inspect the unstained bacteria . They were quivering and were edging away from their dying fellows . None of them , in spite of their exterior membranes , would go unaffected  --  all had channels that led from the soup deep into their own interiors . Andp230under an electron microscope , I knew that those seemingly impermeableexterior membranes themselves would dissolve into a series of perforations . I knew , too , that radioactive tracers applied on a tree stump shortly turned up inside all the neighboring trees . Bev 's action was not a self-contained incident ; its reverberations would affect us all . I washed the slides and hung up my coat . As I walked back to the dorm , I plucked a leaf off a forsythia bush and stared at it as though I had never seen a leaf before . Its atoms and subatomic particles were identical to those making up my fingers . Those atoms combined to form molecules that were identical  --  in the leaf and in my fingers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins and enzymes and hormones  --  similar in the leaf and in my fingers . The enzymes in grasses closely resembled those in an elephant . The sap flowing through the forsythia bush , in composition almost identical to blood , which in turn was identical to dilute sea water  --  from which all life came , to which it would return . And in that sap substances similar to those distinguishing human blood as type A or type B. Our earth was a burned-out hunk of mineral ash , but we  --  this leaf and Eddie and Bev and I  --  we were star stuff . Our bodies were almost entirely made up of light volatile elements . We had origins far grander than the cinder we inhabited would indicate . What affected one segment affected us all . I shuddered as the vision of Bev and me in the bathtub stall passed before my eyes . I left my books in my room and grabbed a notebook and a quilt . After listening at Eddie 's door and concluding that she was out , I opened it and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines and newspapers . There was a new sculpture on her window seat since the last time I 'd sneaked through  --  a polished mahogany carving of a woman 's torso , from neck to upper thighs . The body was voluptuous , solid and firm , not flabby . Eddie herself might have been the model for it . Bev 's body floated through my head in contrast  --  long , lean , gawky , angular . Trying to dispel this persistent mental picture of Bev slumped over dying while I debated the topic of suicide prevention , I opened the window and climbed out on the roof . It had walls on two sides , and so was partially protected from breezes . A third side was a low wall that overlooked the courtyard and the lake . I stood behind this wall and looked down , down , five floors down to the stone courtyard below . A rehearsal was underway there for the May Court , to be heldp231the next day . The May Court was a Worthley ritual involving various rites of spring and dances around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Mistress and attendants were elected from the student body each spring . In keeping with Worthley 's liberal tradition , the queen was usually handicapped in some way  --  an amputee or a member of a racial minority . This year 's queen had had a radical mastectomy and was n't expected to survive the summer . I spread the quilt and removed my clothes and lay down on my stomach . I read at random through my notes , marking here and there with a pen , trying to get an idea for a term paper for my **27;2736;TOOLONG course . Soon I realized that I 'd been reading and rereading two passages . I 'd underlined each with my felt pen a couple of dozen times , until the underlinings had overlapped to form a big wet blue blotch that was soaking through the page . The sun was high and hot , but I felt as though dark clouds had moved in front of it . My body was clammy , and my teeth started chattering . I dropped the notebook and rolled over on my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes closed , unable to move . I felt my lips turning blue . My stomach was a knot of panic . I kept taking deep breaths to still the fear . I heard a noise . I could n't open my eyes to trace its origin . I heard a voice , Eddie 's , saying , " Christ , Ginny , you look awful . Are you all right ? " I could n't move my lips to answer her . " Ginny ? " she said with alarm in her voice . She was somewhere near my head . I heard my notebook rustling . She was reading to herself the quotes I had underlined from Nietzsche and Kierkegaard : " ' Do we not now wander through an endless Nothingness ? ' Philosophy has tried anything and everything in the effort to help the individual to transcend himself objectively , which is a wholly impossible feat ; existence exercises its restraining influence , and if philosophers nowadays had not become mere scribblers in the service of a fantastic thinking and its preoccupation , they would long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of its striving . ' " " Jesus , " she said quietly . I was shivering spasmodically under my quilt . I breathed in deep irregular gasps . I was perfectly aware of doing these things , but I seemed incapable of stopping them or of doing anything else . " But Ginny , " she pointed out , as though I were sitting up conversing with her , " you did n't underline the rest of that Kierkegaardp232quote . Did you read it ? Shall I read it to you ? " Undaunted by the absence of an answer , she read it : " The scribbling modern philosophyholds passion in contempt ; and yet passion is the culmination of existence for an existing individual  --  and we are all of us existing individuals . In passion the existing subject is rendered infinite in the eternity of the imaginative representative , and yet he is at the same time most definitely himself . ' " She stopped reading . I heard some movements to one side . Then she asked matter-of-factly , " Ginny , could you please put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out yesterday , and I 'm getting burned . " Wonder of wonders , I tossed off my quilt , sat up obediently , took the lotion from her , and began rubbing it into her smooth reddish brown back . Then I lay back down on my stomach and wrapped up in the quilt and resumed my shivering . " Shall I put some on you ? You 're looking pink , too . " When I did n't answer , she crawled over and removed the quilt and started anointing my back . She covered my arms and shoulders and hips and legs with the oil as well . It was as though she were rubbing life back into me . Where her hands had been , my flesh glowed with warmth . She pushed me , and I rolled over cooperatively . She rubbed the baby oil into my chest and breasts and abdomen and legs . My shivering subsided . The lump in my stomach began breaking up under her hands like a frozen pond in the spring . She crawled down to my feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and patted oil on my cheeks and forehead and across my upper lip . Then she lay down next to me and cradled me in her arms , my head on her chest right over her heart . I do n't know how long we 'd been lying like that , me listening to her pounding heart and timing my breathing to it . It might have been minutes or hours . In any case , at some point , we heard a rapid flapping sound . And soon our bodies were being swept by great swirling eddies of air . Above us hovered a helicopter from the nearby air force base . A shaven male head leaned out and shouted through cupped hands at the top of his voice , " You goddam Worthley dykes ! " Then a hand reached out with a can of some sort , and soon Eddie and I were splattered with showers of Coca Cola . Eddie leapt up in all her nude magnificence and raised both armsp233high above her head and shook her middle fingers . " Pigs ! " she screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept off on its other missions of national defense . The rehearsal in the courtyard was a shambles as the May Court stood staring skyward at Eddie 's gorgeous body , poised on the roof five floors above them . " Do n't jump ! " someone screamed , and the courtyarderupted in a flurry of activity , people racing for the doors to take the elevator to the roof to restrain Eddie . " Well ! " Eddie said with a grin , " shall we be licking the Coke off each other when they arrive ? " We crawled rapidly to her window and scrambled through it . As we raced , hand in sticky hand , to the bathroom , we heard the whir of ascending elevators . I hesitated at the bathroom door . " It 's been cleaned up , " Eddie assured me grimly . I walked in with all the enthusiasm of a plane crash survivor boarding a new plane . I sniffed and thought I could smell sour vomit . I began shivering as I looked in the tub enclosure . Eddie pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap . Then I lathered her . Then we held each other and kissed in the spray . We stayed there until we 'd used up all the hot water in the dorm ; the pipes began clanking furiously . We spent that night in Eddie 's narrow lumpy institutional bed , sleeping in each other 's arms until after lunch . I woke up delighted finally to know who put what where in physical love between women . When I got up and had dressed in my tweed suit , I descended in the elevator to the first floor . It was 3:25 . I knew Miss Head would be just finishing her afternoon cello practice and settling down to work on her book . I paused outside her door , under the stern gaze of the Worthley hall of fame , and tried to decide exactly why I was there . Unsuccessful , I knocked on the thick door . Miss Head opened it and inspected me with a mixture of pleasure and irritation at having her careful afternoonschedule interrupted , and by someone who knew how important it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly . I marched in and stood awkwardly in her living room shifting from one low-heeled pump to the other . " Sit down , " she suggested , looking at me curiously . " Tea ? " " Yes , thanks . "  | " Well ! What can I do for you , Miss Babcock ? " she asked as she handed me a cup and saucer . I braced myself and waited for my words to flow . I even opened my mouth . But nothing came out . The speech centers of my brain were betraying me . " Nothing much . Just passing by . " " How nice , " she said , with a forced smile . I knew how it upset her to have her routine disturbed because I had experienced the same irritation two nights ago when Bev had asked me to drop everything and have supper with her . " Excuse me , " she said , after a long wait to see what I wanted , " but I was just finishing up work on some Schubert lieder . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She set the metronome to ticking at a slow pace . Then she picked up her bow and positioned her cello . After one measure , she stopped and said , " Be sure to notice the exquisite coloratura , Miss Babcock . A young man is singing . It 's spring and the flowers are blooming and the birds are singing and building their nests . But he is distraught , and unable to participate in this sense of renewal because his true love has died during the winter . I suggest you observe the ways in which Schubert manipulates his melodies so as to set up this tension between the living and the dead . " She nodded at me sternly . I gritted my teeth , but she did n't notice my anger . Nodding to pick up the beat from the metronome , she began again , swaying on her antique chair . The song alternated between a sweeping soulful line in the lower registers , and a high , light dancing line that suggestedflickering sunlight and fluttering leaves and warbling birds . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and rested her head against the neck of the cello as she fingered the strings with a trembling pressure . As I watched , her knees tightenedtheir grip on the curved cello sides , and a flush rose into her pallid face . I jumped up and stalked over and stood in front of her trembling . " Miss Head , I  --  I  --  " I was trying to tell her that I loved her , or something equally ill-thought-out . I yearned to grab away her infernal red cello and enfold the dear misguided woman in my strong , alive flesh . Because of my tutelage under Eddie last night , I felt it my mission to save Miss Head from her own plodding brain . Her eyes flew open , and she stared at me with alarm as I stood quivering with repressed fervor before her . " Why , Miss Babcock , whatever is the matter ? " she demanded ,  |p235letting  her bow drop to the floor . The metronome ticked on slowly . The hot spring sun beat down through her leaded glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible , " I insisted in a low anguished voice . " What you want . It is n't possible . You have to plunge in and make messes and risk rejection  --  and stuff . " My sermonette was n't coming off as I 'd intended . She sat up stiffly in her chair and inquired coolly , " What are you talking about , Miss Babcock ? You 're not making sense . " I looked at her helplessly as the metronome ticked slower and slower ; either it was running down , or time was telescoping . " I  --  II'mnot going to finish out my independent study with you this term ! " " Nonsense . Of course you are , Miss Babcock . " " But I 'm not . " " Do n't be ridiculous . " " I ca n't . " " Of course you can . " " I wo n't ! " " You will ! " " Miss Head , I 'm a lesbian , " I announced defiantly . She sat perfectly still and said nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making love with Eddie Holzer , and it was wonderful . " Eventually Miss Head looked up . " Indeed , " she said . " And would you like some more tea ? " I grabbed the metronome and wrenched off the pendulum and hurled it to the floor . " Will you stop this goddam thing and listen to me ? " " My dear Miss Babcock , " she replied evenly , looking at her wrecked metronome , " I am not your mother . Do n't come to me for approval . " " I have n't come to you for approval ! I do n't give a shit what you think ! " " Then why are you here ? " She had me there . I thought about it for a few moments . " I 'm here , Miss Head , to try to save you from yourself before it 's too late . Do n't you see where you 're heading ? You 're so goddam detached that you 're morally paralyzed ! You 're so busy with your fucking ideas that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ! " I gestured expansively around her apartment.  | " I 'm afraid I shall have to ask you to leave , Miss Babcock . " Aha ! I knew it ! I knew she would reject me if I failed to conform to her way of life . I stalked triumphantly to the door . At the door I faltered . I turned around , and Miss Head and I gazed at each other with pain . I retained enough tattered objectivity to recognize what I had just said as a lie . I was projecting shamelessly , pinning my own failings with regard to Bev onto Miss Head . Miss Head , to the contrary , had involved herself  --  with me . She loved me almost as though I were her daughter , and I knew it . But she had served her purpose . She had been the thesis to Eddie 's antithesis . The show had to go on  --  however ruthlessly . I looked at her helplessly . She seemed numb  --  gray and tired there in the spring sun . Did she understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my development that I reject her by manipulating her into rejecting me ? ( I had n't taken Psychology 101 for nothing . ) I almost ran back over to her to apologize , to explain this Hegelian phenomenon to which I was apparently a puppet . But she was the professor . And Eddie was waiting . My face contorted with anguish , I spun around and strode out . Eddie sat on her window seat in the sun . She had her carving of the female torso in her lap and was lovingly rubbing linseed oil into it . I watched as she ran her hands up and down it , smoothing the oil over the breasts and down the thighs and into the crotch . My breathingquickened . Smiling with mixed delight and embarrassment at my new state of affairs , I curled up with Heidegger 's Being and Time on the foot of Eddie 's bed . At some point I realized that I had been reading the same paragraphover and over again for several minutes without understanding any of it . I frowned . Finally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses " Eddie looked up from her mahogany torso . " What does n't ? " " Listen to this ! The running-ahead reveals to Being-there the lostness into Oneself and brings it before the possibility . . . of Being itself  --  itself , however , in the passionate freedom for death which has rid itself of the illusion of the One , become factual , certain of itself , and full of anxiety . The of-what of anxiety is Being-in-the-world as such . That that which is threatening is nowhere , is characteristic of the ofwhatof anxiety . Dying shows that death is constituted ontologically by always-mineness and existence . It is in the Being ( Sein ) of thep237things-that-are that the nihilation of Nothing ( das Nichten des Nichte ) recurs ! ' " I was shivering by the time I finished , and I could hardly read the last sentence for the chattering of my teeth . A billowing black curtain was being drawn across my mind . Logic , pushed to its extreme , was about to short-circuit my brain . Eddie wiped the linseed oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book from me and threw it across the room and sat down and took my head in her lap and stroked my face and hair . Slowly , as though waiting for me to stop her , she pulled my hairpins out and undid my tight Helena Head bun . She ran her hands through my hair and covered my face with it playfully . Then she divided it into three clumps and began plaiting it into one large braid down my back . " We 've got to get out of this place , " she said quietly , as the May Court danced around Artemis in the courtyard . " It 's a goddam madhouse. "  |p238Mrs  . Babcock could see nothing . It was pitch black and quiet as a tomb . Where was she ? Her body was chilled . She was shivering , and her teeth were chattering . She could n't think where she was . She felt around her with her hands . She was clearly in a bed , on a mattress . She began enumerating the various beds in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small child , the king-sized bed she had shared with Wesley .... This bed was too wide to be the cot , too narrow to be the king-sized bed . Where was she ? She felt something clammy and sticky on the sheets . Panic flared up in her . Oh God , it was so cold and dark ! Was she alone here , wherever she was ? She listened intensely , but heard nothing . She could taste blood as she swallowed . She thrashed out in terror , and in doing so found the light switch against her headboard . Light flooded her hospital room . She sighed with relief . Until she looked down and discovered that her pillow and sheets were soaked with dark blood . She studied the blood with detachment , as though it had nothing to do with her . It looked like anyone else 's blood . It looked exactly as her own blood had always looked . What then was wrong with it , that it was gushing out like this ? She rubbed an index finger in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood tasted as salty as usual . She joined her thumb and index finger , andp239then pulled them gently apart . It seemed as sticky as ever . Why was it failing her like this ? She pressed her call button . Soon she heard steps . In bustled Miss Sturgill , who froze halfway across the room , staring with concealed horror at Mrs. Babcock 's bedding . " Oh dear ! " she said . " Oh my ! " " I 'm sorry . I 'm afraid I 've made a mess . " " Oh goodness . " Miss Sturgill helped Mrs. Babcock to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary pad . " Wait a minute . Let me get you some tampons too . When Mrs. Babcock emerged , Miss Sturgill had changed the bed . The stained sheets lay in a heap . Miss Sturgill helped her back into bed and then pulled the saturated cotton from her nose and into a pan . Mrs. Babcock lay back exhausted , with blood trickling down her throat , while Miss Sturgill repacked her nostrils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs with a sponge . " There ! " Miss Sturgill said briskly , as though to a child . " Does n't it feel nice having fresh clean sheets ? " " Not in the middle of the night . " She 'd intended the remark to sound wry and witty . Instead it came out whiny and pathetic . " Thank you , Miss Sturgill , " she added , trying to redeem herself . Miss Sturgill rushed out to call Dr. Vogel . She rushed back in and gave Mrs. Babcock half a sleeping pill . " He wants you to sleep until he comes in to do his rounds in a couple of hours . " Dr. Vogel dragged her from her drug-induced slumber by inquiringwith forced cheer , " And how are we this morning , Mrs. Bab-cock ? " Mrs. Babcock explored her body mentally and decided that " we " felt pretty well , all in all , considering that she 'd nearly bled to death in the night . Dr. Vogel examined her chart and poked at the cotton in her nostrils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blood pressure and temperature . Occasionally he muttered , " Hmmm , yes , hmmm . " " I must remind you , Mrs. Babcock , " he finally said , " that I did warn you of possible repercussions from failure to take your medica-tion . " Mrs. Babcock pointed mutely to the empty spot on her table , formerly occupied by the spurned steroids . Dr. Vogel flushed and said , " Hmmm , yes , hmmm. "  | " Well ! " he said . " Hot enough for you ? " " I have n't been outside for weeks . " " Yup , a scorcher today . A real scorcher . " He folded his stethoscopeand stuck it in the jacket of his lab coat and sidled toward the door . " Dr. Vogel ? " His blond head swiveled toward her with reluctance ; his hand was on the door handle . " I do n't understand what 's happening to me , Dr. Vogel . Would you be good enough to explain it , in simple words ? " He blushed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have to complete my rounds .... " " After your rounds , then . " " Yes , certainly , Mrs. Babcock . " Mrs. Babcock settled back to await the arrival of a nurse to walk her to breakfast . She punched impatiently at her embroidery hoop with the needle . Pamela , the high school girl who was helping her with it , would be crushed this afternoon at how little she 'd accomplishedin a week . She glanced out the window at the red squirrels , which were dashing up and down the trunk of the elm and flicking their tails and chattering busily . She tried to calculate when Ginny would be arriving . It was difficultwithout a clock . If only Ginny would think to bring her one . But Ginny had never been noted for her thoughtfulness .... Judging from the sun , it was about six . Knowing Ginny , she would n't be out of bed before ten . Today Mrs. Babcock proposed to suggest that she return to Vermont . After all , these were n't ideal conditions for a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babcock had recovered . Their relationship had been difficult in the best of times : Ginny 's repertoire of responses to her parents had been twofold  --  sulking and joking , both equally irritating . But the relationshipwhich even normally was trying for them both seemed impossible under these circumstances . The blow-up yesterday had been absurd . If inevitable : Ginny had her household in Vermont to worry about , and Mrs. Babcock her blood . They could n't help each other , and it was ridiculous to try . It was best that Ginny leave . Her child and her husband needed her . After a breakfast of tea and toast , Ginny went to the pine to check her birds . They were hanging from twigs , their eyes closed and theirp241mouths open  --  screaming silently . No sign of their parents . Ginny searched the bookcases , finally locating the bird book her mother had mentioned . It was bulky and authoritative-looking and had been written by the famous ornithologist Wilbur J. Birdsall , living proof of the axiom that name is destiny . Under a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only ten to thirty percent of all baby birds survive to maturity . The others die of starvation , exposure or disease . Parents do not feed congenitally deformed offspring . Some disaster may befall the parent birds , on whom the infants are totally dependent for food . Often baby birds fall from the nest , either by accident or when learning to fly , where they either starve or are eaten by animals . The young of some species can be raised successfully by humans . Others , the swift family for example , feed on partially digestedregurgitated food from the parent birds and can not be hand fed in captivity . It is best to kill such birds should they be found , to avoid prolonging their suffering . " Feeling ill , Ginny shut the book and sat for a long time . Then she went in the kitchen and got a glass of water . Outside she dipped her index finger in the water and shook a drop into the open mouth of a baby bird . Its eyes opened wide , and it trembled  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She repeated this several times for all three birds . It occurred to her that she could just as well pick them up one at a time and submerge them in the glass until they stopped struggling . Instead , she sat on the stone steps and brooded . It seemed unlikely that she could throw up at will to provide them with food . And anyway , human digestive juices would probably corrode a bird 's gastrictract . Staring distractedly at the stone steps , another image assembled itself : She was holding a baby bird on a step in one hand . In the other hand , she held a big stone , like the decorative piece of white quartz next to the doorway . One well-aimed stroke would do it . ... Seizing a machete off the wall , she went out front and hacked awayat the kudzu in the hot sun , trying to postpone the decision . But asshe was hacking , she had another vision : a baby bird on the chopping block by the side of the cabin ; one deft slice with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . As she unhooked one bird from hisperch , he opened his dark round eyes and screeched at her , as thoughbeseeching her to deal with him mercifully . The water had apparentlyrevived him ? She made the decision not to decide . She would give thep242horrid parents one more chance . She definitely did n't relish being God . She put on a fresh Boone 's Farm Apple Wine T-shirt and some bib overalls . Then she sat down and tried to decide whether even to go to the hospital . She and her mother had wound up yesterday yelling at each other . That certainly could n't be very good for her mother . And she knew it was n't good for herself . She had woken up that morning with a horrible headache and overwhelming seizures of remorse . Maybe she should think of an excuse for rushing back to Vermont ? And then go somewhere else instead . If only she had somewhere else , anywhere else , to go . And if only she could learn how serious this disease was . She went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the way to the hospital , she stopped at the big house and gathered up the photos of relatives from her mother 's bedroom mantel . She would take them as a peace offering . Taking down the photo of her Great-grandmother Hull , her mother 's grandmother , Ginny scrutinized it . Her mother had always said that Ginny looked so much like her . She was Ginny 's age in this photo , in her late twenties . She wore a high-necked lace blouse with a pin of some sort at the throat . Her hair was mostly pinned up , but wisps escaped here and there . Ginny moved in front of the ornate gilded mirror above the mantel and studied herself . As always , it was a shock . She rarely recognized her own reflection . Her estimation of her looks varied with her mood ; today she rated herself well below average . She held up the picture of her great-grandmother so that she could see the two of them side by side . Squinting her eyes and then opening them wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always insisted existed  --  other than the fact that they each had a nose and two eyes and so forth . She stared hard at this great-grandmother whom she 'd never met . Dixie Lee Hull . She had been a legendary cook , right up until the day she had cut her finger on the recipe card for spoon bread and had died of blood poisoning . Nine children she left behind her . One of her daughters , Ginny 's grandmother , had loathed housework and cookingand had spent her adulthood going to club meetings . One child had been more than enough for Ginny 's grandmother  --  Ginny 's mother , who had devoted herself completely to her family and her home . And so it went , alternating generations , each new scion implic/itly criticizing its parents by rejecting their way of life . Ginny knew that even before she was born , she had been fated to neglect her child and her housework , to be driven from her home at gunpoint . Just as poor Wendy was now fated to pick up the gauntlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to keep a spotless house packed to the rafters with babies . It was exhausting , this process , and in contradiction to Hegel , no progress appeared to be resulting from this recurring juxtaposition of thesis and antithesis . But the most remarkable thing , Ginny reflected , was that she contained within each of her cells the tiniest fraction of a germ of nucleic acid from the very body of the woman in this cracked yellow photo , delivered to her via the intercession of her mother and grandmother . Traced back twenty generations , or six hundred years , Ginny calculated that she would find herself directly related to some 1,048,576 people  --  probably the entire population of northern Europe at that time , which was where her forebears had come from . It gave her a creepy sense of continuity , as though she were onstage now muffing her lines , with ghostly ranks of ancestors backstage hissingand booing . If you cared to carry it back through the centuries , every person in existence had identical submicroscopic specks of genetic material from the original man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the tiniest imaginable flecks from the original cell , fertilizedinto existence by a lightning bolt . It was stifling really . No wonder humankind was insane , with so much inbreeding through the eons . This speck of genetic material from her great-grandmother exercised such a pervasive influence as to make Ginny look almost identical to her  --  or so everyone said , although Ginny herself still could n't see it . This speck accounted for the fact that , although they had never met , Ginny could see that their smiles were exact duplicates : They both smiled mostly with their eyes rather than with their mouths . Ginny wondered what one picture her descendants would seize on to remember her by . This was probably one of the only pictures ever taken of Dixie Lee Hull . To have it done , she would have had to take a day out from her spoon bread baking , put on what was probably her only fancy outfit , and travel to Big Stone Forge by wagon . It must have been a big deal . Whereas Ginny had appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moods and modes of dress , top244say nothing of the thousands of feet of Kinflicks that featured her . How would her descendants be able to settle on one shot as representative ? Which one would Ginny herself select ? Then she remembered that this question was strictly academic . At the rate she was going , her descendants would hasten to prune her from the family tree . Ira was doing his best to make Wendy forget her , and Ginny could n't imagine that she 'd ever marry again or have another child . The line of Hull women had perhaps gasped its last . Inordinately distressed by this thought , Ginny rushed downstairs and rifled her mother 's desk . She removed some pictures from an album  --  a shot of Ginny as a baby in a white dress being held by her own mother , and another of Wendy as a baby being held by Ginny . She stuffed these in an envelope and addressed it to Wendy in Vermont . Surely Ira would n't dare to confiscate Wendy 's mail ? Drained , she picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and etched glass door . She dusted it carefully with the tail of her shirt . Then she wound it  --  eight turns and no more . She and Karl and Jim had waged horrible battles over whose turn it was to wind the clock each week . Even as a supposed adult , Ginny enjoyed the crunching sound as she wound . As she was wrapping the clock in a sheet , she heard a scratching sound at the door . In burst a middleagedwoman in a blond wig . Close behind her came a middle-aged couple , both dressed in fashionable summer suits . The woman was shrieking in a thick New Jersey accent , " Oh Harry ! Do n't you just love it ? The children would be so thrilled to live in a real southern mansion ! " Harry grumbled , " Well , it needs a lot of work , dear .... " The woman in the wig drawled encouragingly , " Well , honey , you ca n't get much more authentic than this in Hullsport . It was built by Mr. Zed Hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to live in this house ! Why , it 's a gem , purely a gem ! " She looked up , startled to find Ginny suspended midway through wrapping a clock in a sheet . " Well , howdy , honey , " said the woman in the wig . " I bet you 're the cleaning girl ? " " No , I 'm a burglar , " Ginny said , staring insolently at the three housebreakers . " Actually , I 'm Virginia Babcock . Who are you ? " " Why , I declare ! " the woman cried . " Ginny , honey , it 's been so long since I 've seen you that I like to not knowed you ! Why , you must have grown two feet ! "  | " No , I 've always had two feet , " Ginny replied , glaring at her . Who was this babbling idiot ? " Thelma Buford , honey , from up at Southland Realty , " the wigged woman reminded her , sounding hurt . " Oh . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ginny had been at Hullsport High with her daughter . The daughter had talked too much , too . " Fine , thank you . And yoursef ? " " Fine , thank you . " " These here people are the Hotchkisses . They 're moving down from up at New Jersey . Mr. Hotchkiss is with your daddy 's plant . They 're just real interested in your house here . " " We think it 's just elegant , " Mrs. Hotchkiss assured Ginny . Thinking fast , Ginny said " Oh , you mean my father cleared up that mess about the title before he died ? " " What mess ? " Mrs. Buford snapped . " The title is clear as a bell . " She smiled reassuringly at the Hotchkisses . " Oh , that 's right ! " Ginny gasped . She threw her hand to her mouth . " I was n't supposed to mention it , was I ? " Mr. and Mrs. Hotchkiss were glancing at each other uneasily . " What are you talking about , Ginny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginny said brightly , with a knowing glance at Mrs. Buford to indicate her infinite cooperation in deception . " Nothingat all . " The Hotchkisses fidgeted nervously . " Well ! What else do you have to show us , Mrs. Buford ? " Mr. Hotchkiss finally asked . Her mother was at breakfast when Ginny arrived in her room . Hurriedly she unwrapped the clock and placed it on the bedside table . Then she took out some gummed picture hangers and positioned them on the wall bedside the bed . When they had dried , she hung the photos  --  Dixie Lee Hull , Great-uncle Lester , Cousin Louella , Grandpa Zed with his wild white hair . Nothing got things accomplishedquite so efficiently as guilt , Ginny reflected . Then she sat down and listened with pleasure to the steady ticktock . Soon her pulse was throbbing in cadence with the ancestral clock . As Ginny sat concentrating on this unlikely biological feat , her mother shuffled in on the arm of Mrs. Childress . Mrs. Babcock glanced around the room , startled . As she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into a smile , and she said with surprise , " Why , thank you , dear . "  |p246Ginny  smiled back , her guilt temporarily allayed . It was really so easy to please her mother . She did n't require much . Why then had she , Ginny , spent most of her life trying to make her miserable ? " How are you feeling today ? " " Fine , thank you . Better . " Mrs. Babcock settled herself in bed and gazed with affection at the faces in the photographs while the clock ticked away . Soon Dr. Vogel appeared . He sat in an armchair and crossed his legs , prepared to stay a while for once . " All right , Mrs. Babcock , I 'll give it to you straight , since you 've asked me to . " They settled back , bracing themselves for their respective tasks in this interchange . " Now . How does blood clot ? All right . In grossly oversimplified terms , there are some twelve compounds referred to as clotting factors . These factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prothrombin in the presence of prothrombinaseand calcium yields thrombin . And fibrinogen in the presence of thrombin yields fibrin . Platelets under the influence of thrombin break down so as to liberate ADP , which causes other platelets to clump at the site of tissue injury . The clumping platelets , interspersed along fibrin , form the clot . " Ginny looked at him with disgust . Was this the best he could do for the unfortunate layman ? Mrs. Babcock looked dazed . " Hmmm , yes , hmmm , " he continued . " So you see , a disorder at any point in this chain can inhibit clotting  --  the absence of any of the twelve factors in appropriate amounts , a malfunction of any of the chemical reactions . Hemophilia , for example , results from a factor deficiency . However , because of your platelet count , one can conclude that factor deficiency does n't apply in your case . You see , those with factor deficiencies do n't exhibit low platelet counts as well . Hmmm , yes . So  --  you are not factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,000/mm3 compared to a normal count of over 150,000/mm3 , using the Coulter Counter Model F. " Hmmm , yes , hmmm . Now . How do platelets come to be deficient ? Hmmm , yes , hmmm . Well , platelets can be deficient if an insufficient number is being produced . Yes ? Or if they 've gone into hiding somewhere . Hmmm , yes . Or if they 're being destroyed . The reason people have been extracting all the blood from you , Mrs. Babcock , is that we 've been doing tests to try to narrow down the reason in your particular case . Hmmm , yes . Now cells in the bone marrow called megakaryocytes exude the small bodies of protoplasmp247that we call platelets . If platelet production were low , one would expect the megakaryocyte count in the bone marrow to be depressed . However , we 've done a bone marrow aspiration and your megakaryocytic count appears to be normal . This is nice because it means that you are n't in the early stages of leukemia , which sometimes exhibits symptoms similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been dying of leukemiaunawares because nobody had bothered to consult the subject of all these amazing tests ? " Hmmm , yes . So  --  this would indicate that your platelets are hiding , Mrs. Babcock . Or that they 're being destroyed . Now . How are platelets destroyed ? " Ginny felt as though she were being hypnotized by the ticking of the clock and the simultaneous pulsing of her blood , which blood was apparently healthy only through some fluke of nature . How could anyone 's blood be healthy with all these things to go wrong ? " The spleen functions as a filter , " Dr. Vogel was saying . " It sequestersand destroys worn out or diseased blood components . It 's possible that your body has formed an antibody to your own platelets and your spleen is destroying them . We 're still trying to narrow this down and should have an answer for you in the next few days . Well ! Any questions ? " Ginny and Mrs. Babcock sat as mute as college students during a discussion period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked finally . " Hmmm , yes , hmmm . Ah , actually we do n't exactly know . " " Who is this ' we ' you keep referring to ? " Mrs. Babcock asked . " Hmmm , yes . ' We . ' Modern medicine , I suppose . " He blushedand shifted in his chair . " So you gave me steroids to spur platelet production even though you already knew from my bone marrow aspiration that I was producingenough ? " Mrs. Babcock asked casually . " Hmmm , yes . Well , no , not exactly . Well , you see , we do n't know exactly how steroids work . We just know that often they do work . " " But not this time , " Mrs. Babcock reminded him . " Well , no . " " So what happens next ? " Ginny asked " Hmmm , yes . Well , next we try a transfusion . We 'll give you two units of whole blood , Mrs. Babcock , with the idea that your bloodstreamcan use the foreign platelets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will alleviate your anemia and low blood pressure for a time . By then we expect to have pinned down your difficulty so that we can treat it directly . It 's also possible , though not medically proven , that these foreign platelets could exercise some sort of ' priming ' effect on your own bloodstream . I 've seen it happen . " " What you 're saying is that you really do n't know what you 're doing ? " Ginny asked . Dr. Vogel stood up . " My dear young lady , I assure you that we in the medical profession know a good bit more about what we 're doing than a layman . " Ginny did n't reply . She had learned from observing Eddie Holzer , who had done it all the time , that it was impossible to discuss issues civilly with a person who insisted on referring to himself as " we . " " Granted it 's trial and error , to an extent , but it 's educated trial , trained error . " Ginny stared at him evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as we can find a donor . We need fresh blood , not more than an hour old , because the platelets in stored blood are often injured or dead . But you have an uncommon blood type , Mrs. Babcock . Did you know that ? You could get forty-five dollars a pint for it on the Bowery in New York City . " He laughed weakly . " But we 're typing the staff for a donor right now . " " What type is it ? " Ginny asked . " B negative . " " That 's my type . I could maybe be her donor . " " Why did n't I think of you ? Let me type you . " He raced from the room in search of a syringe . Only then did Ginny and Mrs. Babcock realize simultaneously that they still had n't gotten any definitive answer about the ultimate severityof Mrs. Babcock 's condition . " What did he say ? " Mrs. Babcock asked , her yellow face haggard . " I do n't know , " Ginny confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? I mean , they 're certainly going all out with these tests and things . " She knew that her efforts to feign cheerfulness were n't convincing . " Where 's Dr. Tyler these days ? " she asked , intentupon tracking him down so that she could question him . " He goes to his cabin at Spruce Pine near Asheville in the summer now . "  |p249Ginny  turned on the television . " The Price Is Right " was on . She and her mother stared at it vacantly . Ginny was well-acquainted with the show . It had formed the backdrop for much of her morning housework in Vermont . Most of the things being won  --  a lifetime supply of Alpo dog food , a ceiling-to-floor bookcase complete with a leather-bound set of the outer covers of the world classics , a year 's subscription to New York 's most prestigious wake-up service , a shipto-shoreshort-wave radio  --  neither of them needed , which was nice because it meant that they did n't have to squander their vital energies being envious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up for grabs . Mrs. Babcock had always longed to go to Ireland , Scotland , England in search of the towns her forebears had come from . Wesley had always refused to take her . He had no business to do over there . The trip would n't be tax-deductible . It was out of the question . What about the IRA ? she had suggested . Do n't they make bombs ? It had never occurredto her to go alone . The household would collapse in her absence . " Let 's go on a trip to Ireland when I get out of here , " Mrs. Babcock suggested . Ginny glanced at her doubtfully  --  doubtful about her mother 's getting out in the first place , doubtful about her stamina for a trip if she did , doubtful about the two of them even going to downtown Hullsport in a friendly fashion , and especially doubtful about the strained cheerfulness of her mother 's voice . " Sure . That would be fun , " Ginny said brightly . The thing was , she 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's stories , she felt a definite bond with her ancestors . They had been German Lutherans from the Catholicpart of Germany , Puritans and Pilgrims from Anglican England , Anglicans in the Catholic south of Ireland , Scotch Irish Presbyterians in the Catholic sector of Scotland after the ' 45 . Misfits , all of them , with loyalties every bit as confused and fragmented as Ginny 's had always been . Was this proclivity for propelling oneself into circumstancesin which one was bound to feel set apart from the surrounding community hereditary , a result of those minute flecks of nucleic acid in each cell ? Or was the proclivity absorbed from one 's parents , in the same way that kittens learned to drink milk by watching their mother ? " ... and I consider it a privilege to be deemed worthy of suffering like this , " Sister Theresa was saying fervently , when Ginny and Mrs. Babcock arrived at the sun porch for lunch.  | " A privilege ! " Mr. Solomon snorted , his thick lenses magnifying his eyes to the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been singled out for special favors , eh , Sister ? I like that vun . God says , ' There 's Sister Theresa . I think so highly of her that I 'd like to give her cancer . ' " Sister Theresa crossed herself . " A privilege , " she confirmed , fingeringthe medal around her neck with the praying hands and the slogan " Not My Will But Thine . " " The Lord gives no one more than he can endure . The cross and the strength to bear it . " " Big of Him . So the number of misfortunes you experience is a token of the cosmic judgment on the well-being of your soul ? " " When I was a little girl at school , Mr. Solomon , " Sister Theresa explained earnestly , " sometimes I would come home crying because the bigger boys had teased me . And my mother would say , ' But they would n't tease you if they did n't like you , child . ' That 's how I see my present situation , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to agree on , Sister . God  --  your God and my God  --  God is a bully ! " Sister Theresa crossed herself again . " I did n't say that , Mr. Solomon , " she said , her eyes lowered and her beefy face turning red . " I said that it is a pleasure for me to bear whatever burden the Lord chooses to place on me . I am strong and the burdens make me stronger . " " Vell , if that vere how it vorked , Sister , I would now be a Charles Atlas of the soul ! " Sister Theresa looked at him questioningly . " My vife and my three little children vere herded into box cars , Sister . I suppose they died . I hope they died . It vould have been a blessing compared to life in the camps . " That 's not fair , Ginny thought . Jewish people always won out in the one-upmanship of suffering . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Solomon . " After a delicate pause , she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Fall . Evil will flourish until all men in their hearts and minds accept Christ our Lord as their savior . God does not perform or condone evil . However , He can turn it to His own ends sometimes . Look what a bright and sensitive race yours is for its suffering , Mr. Solomon . " Mr. Solomon cleared his throat , aware that he was being drowned in honey . " Thank you , Sister . But I still say it 's vun hell of a lousy vayp251to run a vorld . If I had run my jewelry department the vay your God runs this vorld , do you think I 'd have lasted a veek ? No , I 'd have been out valking the streets looking for work . " The electric chimes on the Southern Baptish church were now playing " Call Me Unreliable . " Mrs. Babcock was struggling with an overcooked piece of meat that might have been beef or veal or pork or lamb . " How can you call it ' lousy , ' Mr. Solomon , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see a bird singing ? " Sister Theresa pointed to the bird feeder in the pine tree on which sat a mocking bird . Mr. Solomon 's fist hit the table hard . The dishes jumped , and the silverware clattered . Mrs. Cabel looked up from her meal in alarm for the first time during the entire discussion ; she had food smeared across her face . " I call it lousy for that very reason ! God put me on this earth and made me love vat I found here . Little by little , He 's taken it all avay from me . First my parents , then my vife and babies , then my house and country , and now my occupation and means of livelihood . " He pointed at his cloudy eyes . " I ca n't fix clocks anymore . I can hardly even see the bird you 're talking about , Sister . And soon He vill take avay my breath , and vith it my life . " He was very upset and was breathing with difficulty . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him a sadist . " " No , Mr. Solomon , no . This life is only a pale hint of the next . Death is the beginning , not the end . You lose nothing , you gain everything . Everything precious that 's been taken from you here , you retrieve with interest on the other side . I 'm sure of it , Mr. Solomon . Your wife , your children , everything . " " Yes , I know vat your people say , Sister Theresa . And so you must . You have a product to sell , like all the rest of us . But it vas your man Pascal , Sister , who said , ' The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me . ' But tell me , Sister , ven did you go into the convent ? " This question seemed beside the point to Ginny . She glanced at her mother , who had been watching the exchange intently , like a tennis match . " I was sixteen , Mr. Solomon . Why do you ask ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm obviously upset and out of control . But vat do you know of losing a mate and three children to psychopathic maniacs ? "  |p252Sister  Theresa flushed and said nothing . The conversation appeared to be at an end . The four ate in silence , Ginny looking on from the sofa . That afternoon Ginny lay on the spare bed in her mother 's room , a needle in her right arm . Her blood was spurting down a tube and into a plastic bag that was strapped to the side of the bed . She and her mother had just watched " Hidden Heartbeats . " Sheila 's bridge party had gone poorly . Ella , the wife of Mark 's boss , had not appeared , leaving Sheila one player short . As they limped along with their game , the other women kept whispering behind their cards , as Sheila struggled to maintain a stiff upper lip , about why Ella had snubbed Sheila and wrecked her card party . At the end of the half-hour show , the phone rang . Was it Ella calling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . The tallies , however , which Sheila had spent yesterday 's program picking out in the five-and-ten , had been a great success . All the ladies at the party asked how in the world she 'd managed to find such clever ones . " And on Mark 's salary , too , " a lady added behind her cards to the others . " Do you think it 's Ella on the phone ? " Mrs. Babcock asked Ginny . " I doubt it . Really I think it 's Mark . He 's probably had a run-in at work with Ted , and Ted told Ella not to go to the party . " " Oh , Ella 's not that spineless . " " Do n't you think so ? " " Heavens no . She 'd have called at least , if she were n't going . Something must have happened to her . " " Well , maybe you 're right . " Now " Westview General " was on , which Ginny also remembered from her breast-feeding days . Dr. Marsh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sam , we 've been friends for a long time , Sam . " " Yes , Doc , and that 's the truth , too . " " So , Sam , when I say I hate to  --  " " Doc , you do n't mean  --  " " Sam , buddy , you know I would n't want to lead a friend on  --  " " Doc , you 're not sayin  --  " " Sam , you have to be strong  --  " " You mean  --  " " I 've always leveled with you , have n't I , Sam ? " " Is it  --  " " I 've done the very best I can for you , Sam fella . "  |p253Sam  finally broke down in manly sobs . Dr. Marsh put his arm around Sam 's heaving shoulders and handed him a bill . " Now , Sam , Blue Cross will pay most of it . And you do have your dear wife well and back home again , do n't you now ? " - Ginny lay watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her blood . She knew a great many things about it from physiologyat Worthley . For instance , she knew that only 1.5 percent of Americans had her mother 's and her blood type , B negative . Type B was much more common in Central Asia . How it had found its way to southwest Virginia was a mystery . She also knew that platelets died in three to four days . And she knew that her own healthy bone marrow was turning out five hundred billion of them each day . In other words , Ginny was not returning to Vermont , or to anywhere else , for the present . Her mother needed her . The shoe was on the other foot for a change . It was a novel sensation . She lay still listening to the ticking of the Hull clock , " Westview General " providing the background . She concentrated on her heart , zeroing in on a single red cell . She traced its pathway out of her heart and through her lungs and down her arteries and capillaries to her bigtoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up the capillaries to her veins , and from there back to her heart . If she had been timing this circuit correctly , it should have taken about twenty-five seconds . She looked at the filigreed second hand on the steepled clock and confirmed with satisfaction that it had . Never mind why people died . Why was anyone alive ? How could any one body possibly coordinate all that it had to coordinate ? It was mind-boggling . Red cells , white cells , platelets , antibodies , the twelve clotting factors . The surprising thing was not that the production and delivery system sometimes broke down . The surprise was that it ever functioned flawlessly at all , much less in most of the people one met . When her bag was full of dark red blood , Dr. Vogel removed the needle and told her to hold her arm over her head for a while . Then he put a tourniquet on Mrs. Babcock 's upper arm and began prodding with a sterile needle for a vein . He appeared to be having difficulty . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time . " Young man , must you do your internship on me ? " Mrs. Babcock meant it as a joke , but it came out peevish . Ginny laughed heartily , trying to carry it off . Finally Dr. Vogel found a cooperative vein andp254settled the needle in it . Ginny 's blood flowed down the tube from the plastic bag and into Mrs. Babcock 's body . Ginny , as she rested , considered the justice of this arrangement : Her mother shared her blood with Ginny via the placenta when Ginny had needed it . Now Ginny was simply returning the favor via rubber tubing . There was undeniable satisfaction in the concept that her mother 's blood might " learn " about platelet management from Ginny 's blood . After all , the flow of instruction between them had generally run in the opposite direction . Ginny savored the idea of a reciprocal arrangement . However , if they shared blood type and had shared actual blood at some remote point , did that mean that , genes being what they were , Ginny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ? And Wendy 's ? At least this had gotten her out of the craft program , Mrs. Babcock reflected as she watched Ginny 's blood flow into her arm . She remembered from the encyclopedia how the audience at Roman gladiator fights would leap from the stands and vie to drink the blood of especially skilled and courageous gladiators as they died in the dirt , the idea being to imbibe via their blood their nerve and vigor . " He took the cup ; and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of this ; for this is my Blood of the New Covenant , which is shed for you , and for many , for the remission of sins . " Mrs. Babcock suspected that the wine/blood ritual in Holy Communion had its origin in fact as much as in symbolism . Scientists could take a worm trained to perform some simple activity , chop it in bits , and feed it to an untrained worm ; the untrained worm would suddenly be found to possess the skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genes , RNA , DNA , chromosomes . . . the accumulated experience of the species , passed on in encoded form down through the ages . Just so this transfusion . Her own defective blood could " learn " about platelet husbandry from Ginny 's healthy blood . There was something altogether alarming about this . About her being ill enough to need a transfusion , certainly . But more than that . She did n't like having Ginny as her donor . In the first place , it meant that she could n't suggest that Ginny go back to Vermont . Surely the tension between them could n't be good for either of them , particularly for Mrs. Babcock herself when she needed thorough rest to aid in her recovery . But there was another factor in all this that she was persistentlyp255refusing to face , she knew . A subtle shift in the balance of power between Ginny and herself had occurred , and she did n't like it at all . The pattern had always been Mrs. Babcock 's bleeding herself dry , as it were , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to demand of her . " I live but to serve , " she had quipped gaily when they had come bursting in demanding three dozen chocolate chip cookies for a class Christmas party , or tuna sandwiches for eighteen for a club picnic . But there had been truth in this quip , she now knew . Ceasing to serve , she had collapsed , mentally and physically . And now here Ginny was , serving her  --  lying on the spare bed with an expression of smug satisfaction at doing so . Mrs. Babcock was profoundly uncomfortable with this reversal of roles . That she should feel so uneasy about this suggested to her an unflattering possibility  --  that she had dominated the children through weakness ; she had smothered them with her martyrdom . By always doing everything for them , usually in advance of their requesting it , had she undermined their drive and self-confidence ? That was perhapswhy Jim and Ginny had such difficulty ever sticking with anything , why Karl clung so fanatically to his routines ? But here she was lapsing into self-reproach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in their early years , rather than always in on herself , she would n't be here in this hospital bed today . The truth was that she had done the best she knew how , being an amateur at parenting . Now that she was a professional , having turned out three finished products , her skills were no longer in demand , and it was too late to rectify mistakes committed during her apprenticeship . When Ginny got back to the cabin , the sun was about to plunge behind the kudzu-faced bowl . She went out to the pine tree . Two baby birds hung from twigs , their heads back , their eyes closed , and their yellow beaks open to reveal their delicate pink throats . Suffering , Wilbur J. Birdsall said they were ; and she was allowing them to , requiring them to . She glanced around for the third baby , searching the dish and all the nearby branches . She found it on the ground  --  a stiff corpse , wings outstretched and rigid and mouth gaping for food . Feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kudzu . Then she sat on the stone steps . Her options were clear . She could flush them down the toilet . They would go down with the same ease as a Tampax . She could smash their skulls on the stone steps . She couldp256guillotine them with the machete . If she chose not to sully herself by performing their execution in person , she could move them to the ground , so that the wild cats could find them more easily . Or she could leave them to starve . No , damn it ! She would n't buckle under to the verdict of Wilbur J. Birdsall , world renowned authority or not . These baby birds normallyfed on their parents ' vomit . But at some point their tiny gastrointestinalsystems had to make the conversion to self-digestion . It seemed distinctly possible to Ginny that under extremely stressful conditions such as these , the babies ' systems could develop and convertmore rapidly than usual . It was worth a try anyway . She got a glass of water and fed a drop to each bird . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't move at all . But they were warm , and there were faint hints on their fluff-covered breasts of beating hearts . After a minute or so , each bird swallowed his droplet . And then one drop after another . Ginny mixed raw hamburger and tuna and whole wheat flour into a disgusting paste . Taking a minute bit , she formed a tiny ball . Holdingit between thumb and forefinger , she carefully dropped it into the mouth of one of the babies . She waited . Nothing happened . But then , slowly , the bird 's beak began to twitch . And then the membrane of its pink throat began to expand and contract convulsively , and the tiny ball disappeared , like an insect enfolded by a Venus's-flytrap . Cheered , Ginny fed each bird several balls . In the cabin , she found a small deep basket with a lid . They could cling to its sides , and it would be dark and cool like their lost chimney . She put them in , no longer worrying about sullying them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't Wendy love to be helping her with this project ? Ginny could almost see her mushing her chubby little fingers in the meat paste , trying with an intense frown to form a tiny ball like Mommy 's . She would clutch a bird in a sticky hand and giggle gleefully as it screeched in her face . If only there were some way to prevent her from ripping the birds to pieces in her enthusiasm . She 'd pry their beaks open and poke at their eyes with sticks and dismember their wings in her exuberant curiosity . An idea popped into Ginny 's head with the force and clarity of true inspiration : There was no need to sell the big house ! She and Wendy would live there together ; her mother could live in the cabin . Three generations of Hull women , all in a row !  |p257Cheered  by this thought , she went to the phone and got Dr. Tyler 's number in Spruce Pine . " Why , Ginny , what a pleasure , " he said . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been home much lately . " " What a shame . You know , I feel a special attachment to the people I 've delivered . " " It 's mutual . In fact , I 'm sitting on the bed you delivered me in . " " Is that a fact ? I declare . Law , I member that night so well . Your mother was having really strong contractions , and what do you think happened ? Half a dozen swifts flew down the chimney ! Why , I never saw anything like it in my life ! Those birds fluttered through that cabin in an absolute panic , getting soot all over everything , the ceiling , the walls , the upholstery . Your mother had just cleaned that day so 's everything would be nice and straight while she was laid up with you . Why , she hopped up out of that bed , and she grabbed a broom , and she chased those damn swifts all through the cabin , swatting at em . And every now and then , she 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was over , she 'd hop right back up and chase after em with tears just pouring down her face . And of course your daddy and I were chasing right behind her , trying to get her back to bed and she kept whacking us with her broom , too ! " They were both laughing . " Oh my , it was something to behold ! " " What happened to them ? " " I think your daddy finally managed to get them out the front door . " " Why did they fly down in the first place ? " " Oh , I do n't know . They do that sometimes . Nothing but trouble , swifts . Rats with feathers , I call em . But I do n't imagine you 're calling to discuss birds . What can I do for you , honey ? " " Mother 's in the hospital . " " Is she ? I had n't heard . What 's wrong ? " Ginny had expected him to don his professional manner and take charge of everything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerned but detached . " Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . " " Hmmm . How 's she doing ? " " I do n't know . That 's why I 'm calling you . To find out . " " Who 's her doctor ? "  | " Vogel . " " Vogel . Fine young man . Excellent doctor . Just excellent . She could n't be in better hands . " " He 's been giving her steroids . And today she had a transfusion . " " Standard . " " Yes , but Mother felt the steroids were n't helping . " " Ginny , honey , in the old days before steroids , do you know what we used to do when someone came in with undiagnosable bleeding ? We 'd transfuse , and maybe we 'd excise the spleen . Sometimes it worked , sometimes not . If it did n't , we had to just sit there helplessly and watch more and more hemorrhages develop until the brain hemorrhagedand the patient blessedly died . They 're invaluable , steroids are . And antibiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , if you came down with pneumonia when I was first practicing in Hullsport , you spent all winter in bed . If you were lucky . Lots died . Now they 're up and around in days . " " Well , today , Dr. Tyler , with the steroids and stuff , is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , you know , like , serious ? " " I ca n't tell you , Ginny . Your mother 's not my patient . In general , it 's usually not that serious in children . It tends to clear right up . In adults , it can be more serious . As I said , there 's this danger of cerebral hemorrhage . But it happens rarely these days . " " She could n't , like , die or anything , could she ? " " You know , Ginny , the trouble with patients is that they expect their doctors to be shamans or seers or something . I do n't know . I doubt if Vogel knows . Modern medicine has come a long way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . Idiopathic . Cause unknown . There are hundreds of thousands of things that can go wrong with the human body . We 've catalogued several thousand . One of my teachers in medical school in Richmond once told me , ' As you practice medicine , you 'll find your hat will fit your head better . You will realize that there are many things you do n't know . ' Has your mother been unhappy ? " " Unhappy ? " It had never occurred to Ginny to consider the topic before . Except for the outburst the other day , her mother had invariablybeen briskly cheerful for as far back as Ginny could remember . " She has been the past few years , you know . " " No , I did n't know , " Ginny insisted . " Well , then , I clearly should n't be mentioning it . I 'm an old man and my sense of professional ethics is slipping . "  | " Unhappy about what ? " " Whatever people find to be unhappy about when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But what was she depressed about ? " " Well  --  maybe you should ask her that . " " Who , me ? " " Well , child , you are her daughter . " " But what does depression have to do with her physical health ? " " A great deal , I assure you . " " Then why has n't Vogel mentioned it ? " " It 's a notion that is  --  out of favor among the medical profession at present . We have our fads and fashions like every other field , you know . Tonsillectomies are out now , phenobarbital for infants who convulse is in . And so on . But when you 've been at it as long as I have , when you 've treated people under all sorts of circumstances , when you 've treated their parents and their children , you begin to see patterns . Illness does n't strike randomly , like a thief in the night . Certain types of people at certain points in their lives will come down with certain kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . A disease can serve the same function for an alert doctor as a Rorschach inkblot for a psychologist ; it 's a form of existential self-expression for a patient , if you like . I know this may sound a little farfetched , my dear , but disease is not arbitrary , and it does not ' attack . ' But goodness , you 're not interested in an old man 's pet theories .... " Ginny politely said nothing . Tyler was apparently freaking out in his retirement . " But I can assure you , Ginny , " he added , " that you could n't do better than Vogel . I know that he 's doing everything that can be done . " Ginny had secretly been fantasizing that Dr. Tyler would come out of retirement and take over her mother 's case himself . " Do you think I should tell Mother that there 's this chance of cerebral hem-orrhage ? " There was a long pause . " Well , honey , that 's something you have to decide for yourself . You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a very old man now , and I have to be thinking about my own death , not other people 's . " Unnerved , Ginny said , " Yes , well , it 's been nice talking with you , Dr. Tyler . Thanks for your help . "  | " Not at all , my dear . Any time . Give your mother my love , and tell her I 'll be over to see her when I 'm back home at the end of the summer . " " Yes , I will . Good-by . " She hung up and sat motionless . The phrase " cerebral hemorrhage " kept drifting through her brain . If she were in her mother 's place , she concluded that she 'd want Wendy to tell her . On the other hand , could the specter of cerebral hemorrhage help to trigger one by placing the patient under tension ? Once again she decided not to decide . She preferred being compelledinto her decisions . She would see how her mother responded to the transfusion . She found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dear Miss Head : I am writing you from a need to acknowledge past debts . I know that when I was at Worthley you were trying to teach me to regard issues critically and with detachment , and to organize them into orderly patterns . To the extent that I absorbed these skills , they have proved invaluable . Your philosophy courses and the trips into Boston and the visits in your apartment were bright spots in what was otherwise a difficult and unhappy time for me , and I thank you for them from the bottom of my heart . I have thought about you with pleasure and affection ever since , and I only wish that the circumstancesunder which I left Worthley could have been more mature and more graceful . But you must know that they could n't have been , given what I was like at that time . I 'm sorry I disappointed you so terribly . It 's one of the things in my life I 'm least proud of . I hope you are well , and are busy on your book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginny Babcock Bliss . " She took it to the mailbox at the bottom of Cloyds ' hill before she could reconsider and tear it up . The kitchen lights were still on at Clem and Maxine 's . She decided to stop . " How 's your mother today ? " Clem asked , as Ginny sat down at their dinner table , which was strewn with dirty dishes . The three small dark children , replicas of Clem as a child , were coloring on the floor in a corner . " I do n't know really . She had a transfusion this afternoon . The doctor is very hopeful about . the effect it will have . " " How about some soup beans and corn bread ? " Maxine asked . " There 's lots left . " Ginny had n't eaten all day and had given a pint of blood . " I 'd lovep261some if you 've got it . I 'm starved . " Maxine dished her up a plate . Ginny poured ketchup on the gooey brown beans and dug in greedily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Vermont ? " Clem asked with a laugh . Ginny laughed , too , and decided not to mention that " her man " had run her out . Why wreck a good plate of soup beans ? " Clem , tell me to shut up if this is rude , " Ginny said between bites , " but what 's happened to your leg ? " Clem and Maxine smiled serenely . " Hit 's well , " he said . " I noticed . But how come ? Did you have an operation or some-thing ? " " No , the Lord has made me whole . " " Oh , brother , " Ginny said with a grin . " But He has , Ginny . I pledged my life to Jesus after our wreck , and my leg growed out and straightened hitsef . " Ginny stared at him with disbelief . He pulled up his overall leg . Several appalling scars ran the length of his calf . The scars included puncture marks from the stitches , so that they looked like the seams on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his calf alone . But otherwise the leg looked sound and normal . The healing episode was apparently true . " Well , do you belong to one of the churches at the circle , or what ? " Ginny sputtered . " We got our own ministry , me and Maxine . We meet up at the springhouse , a couple dozen of us , ever Friday night . " " What ? Right up here you meet ? " " Yeah . We 'd love to have you come Friday , would n't we , Maxine ? " Maxine nodded . Ginny sat silent , prodding her sticky beans with her fork . " How about it ? " Clem demanded . " You would n't have to join in . You could just watch . " " Would n't it bother the others ? " Ginny asked , trying to manufacturean excuse for not going . " Not once I told them you was an old friend of mine . " " I do n't know .... " She blotted up the juice from the beans with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change your life . Like hit done mine , " Clem assured her . " But even if hit do n't , what have you lost ? A couple of hours maybe . "  | " Do you preach , or what ? " " We do n't have no set schedule . We do whatever the good Lord instructs us to . " Realizing how deeply offended Clem would be if she refused , Ginny accepted . " What time ? " " Seven thirty , Friday . " " All right . I 'll be there . " " Good , " Maxine and Clem said in unison . " Thanks for supper . " She stood up . Mrs. Babcock woke up on her own the next morning , without having a thermometer crammed in her mouth . She lay still and listened with pleasure to the ticktock of the old clock on her bedside table . That sound had been her constant companion through life . It had filled the cabin when she was a little girl . And when her parents and she had moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room . Sometimes she had perched on the Empire sofa and just listened for an hour or more to the steady ticking . And the most exciting time of the week had been Sunday morning after church when her mother would bring the clock down and allow her to wind it with its filigreed key  --  eight turns and no more . When she and Wesley had married and had begun living in the cabin , her mother had let her take the clock , like the ark in the Old Testament . When Wesley was overseas and Ginny would wake up screaming in the night , Mrs. Babcock would carry her into the living room and walk up and down the length of the room . Holding the tiny baby against her heart , which was beating in time to the clock , she would stroll and would pat Ginny 's shuddering back . She could understand the baby 's alarm  --  this understanding was the only thing that prevented her some nights from taking the baby by the feet and swinging her against the wall . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mother 's heartbeat , a baby was conditioned to that rhythm.Take it away and a baby was lost . It was a need one never got over , Mrs. Babcock had reflected on those dark cold lonely nights as she had strolled endlessly in obedience to the ticking . She had calmed her own self with the conviction that Wesley would be safely home again once the relentless pendulum had ticked off eight more months , or whatever the figure happened to be . And when Wesley did return  --  some twenty-one million ticks of the clock later , as she had calculated one night while hiking up andp263down with the howling baby  --  the passionate love they had made for many months afterwards was rendered that much more passionate for her because it was accompanied with the ticking of that clock , which served to remind her of the unutterable deprivation of Wesley 's absenceand possible death . And when she and Wesley and the children had moved to the big house , the clock came along too , and sat on Mrs. Babcock 's desk in the hallway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting over whose turn it was to wind it . During the day , when she paused in the middle of her housework , she could hear the clock . If she woke up in a panic in the middle of the night , as she had often during her depressions in recent years , she could hear it . The clock had ticked just like this for her great-grandmother , for her grandmother , for her mother . Life went on , states of mind shifted with the ticking , her fears would pass . And they did . But only to return again , as the relentless ticking carried her ever closer to old age and death , ever farther away from the crammed years of young motherhood when she had been too busy or too exhausted to consider the inevitabilityof either . She opened one eye and glanced at the clock  --  the familiar yellowedface and script Roman numerals , the filigreed hands . Her friend , her enemy . Some days it was an enemy toward whom she felt a reluctant affection due simply to familiarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given how many ticks , would she be out of the hospital and back home ? Already she was feeling better . She prodded the wads in her nose and the pad between her legs and found them unstained . The transfusion appeared to be working . Mrs. Babcock stretched all over luxuriously , like a cat in the sun . Someone who had never been seriously ill , who had never observed her bodily processes stalling and sputtering , could n't begin to appreciate the overwhelming sense of physical well-being engendered as those processes began righting themselves . Young Dr. Vogel knew what he was about . There was no longer any question in her mind . She felt sheepish about having challenged his judgment on the steroids . Sliding out of bed , Mrs. Babcock put on her green flannel robe . Her bruises were n't aching , as they usually did when she first stood up in the morning . Looking out the window , she saw the sun coming up  --  a glowing red ball  --  over the hill behind the factory . At her eye level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch to branch in scurrying pursuit of each other . Mrs. Childress came in with her razor . Mrs. Babcock lay down and , with her eyes closed , felt her stabbed ear lobe throbbing to the ticking of the clock . Mrs. Childress was alternately dabbing the punctureand following the second hand of her watch . Much sooner than usual , she turned away . " Seven and a half minutes , Mrs. Babcock ! " she announced , as though Mrs. Babcock had just broken a track record of long standing . " Is that normal ? " " Close to it . " " What 's normal ? " " You have to ask Dr. Vogel . I 'm not permitted to discuss it . " " Why in the world not ? " " He 's the doctor . " " You 're the nurse . " " Four minutes is normal , " she whispered , glancing around guiltily . " But you 're down from twelve , honey . That 's real fine ! "  |p265Eddie  's and my life after Worthley stood outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three kinds of people in the world : those who wear watches , those who do n't wear watches , and those who sometimes do and sometimes do n't . Eddie was firmly entrenched in the second category and was compulsively late in everything she did ; I am in the third category , but that year I was decidedly watchless . Our apartment was on Broadway in Cambridge , on the third floor of a decaying tenement that was slated for urban renewal some time in the next decade . The pipe to the gas stove leaked , so that we had to leave the kitchen window cracked , even in the winter as snow drifted in . We were limited to sponge baths because the shower leaked into the apartment below , which was occupied by a frazzled welfare mother of five who had enough problems without her plaster ceiling 's collapsing as well . The narrow porch off the living room , which overlooked the busy trash-strewn street , was infested with squatters  --  pigeons who cooed and shat all day long . The entire place , advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted out with the rejects from some furniture store 's Fire Damage Sale . The gas oven was so slow in lighting that it threatened to blow up the dreary linoleumed kitchen . In short , it was squalid . Eddie and I loved it . We were finally living arm in arm , cheek by jowl , with The People . Was it our fault if all Thep266People in our neighborhood had applications in for the high rises in the redevelopment areas ? Could we help it that they moved out as fast as they could , only to be replaced by people like ourselves ? Were we to blame that the welfare mother below us scowled and guarded her small children behind her back when we passed on the stairs , mutteringunder her breath , " Filthy dykes " ? I had to keep reminding myself that I was now officially a " lesbian . " I felt that , although I now wore wheat jeans and turtlenecks and sandals and a braid like Eddie 's , basically I had n't changed . Faces glared as Eddie and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ; necks craned with outrage in movie theaters when we held hands . Public indifference to me had shifted to disapproval since I had left Worthley ; but I was still me , whoever that might be . Our only heat was an aging kerosene space heater in the living room , and the only really cozy spot was our bed with its endless layers of ratty quilts salvaged from trash cans and institutional blankets ripped off from Worthley as our parting gesture . Since we were paying our rent and meager expenses with my dividend checks , we had no appointments to keep . Consequently , we spent most of our time huddled in this bed , not particularly knowing or caring if it was day or night . Eddie did , however , continue to play her guitar two nights a week at a coffee house in Cambridge , as she had when she was at Worthley . I became her groupie and sat alone at a dark corner table , listening to her protest songs and watching with pride as people admired her husky voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black turtleneck and tights and skirt she wore for performances . At her breaks , we would sneak a joint together , hiding it under the table . We would get back to our dingy apartment at 3 A.M. or later and would sleep until late afternoon the next day . One day blended into another , and we lost all sense of the passage of time . I slipped into my majority  --  and into control of my trust fund  --  without even knowingit , until papers requiring my signature began arriving from lawyersand brokers . In the process of looking them over and taking charge of " my " monies , a dilemma started nagging at me over the nature of my investments . Eddie and I , for all our languid lolling in bed , were also on the demonstration circuit . We had bought crash helmets and had put American flag decals on them , upside down . Like horse owners on the racing circuit , or football fans with season passes , we went top267every demonstration , large or small , that we happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowdowns . Usually we took picnic lunches , and we had gotten to know many of our fellow career demonstrators quite well . One gorgeous October afternoon we went to a war protest in downtown Boston . The air was crisp , and the sun was hot , and colorfulleaves skittered around on the pavement . We were all in high spirits , even more so when we saw how unalone each of us was , how packed the spacious courtyard was becoming . To the clerks looking down from the towering office buildings and dropping shredded governmentdocuments as confetti , we must have looked like a palpitating invasion of locusts . The speaker , a former official in the attorney general 's office who had lost his position due to his vehement antiwar stand , was eloquent on the topic of the futility of violence . Earnest young mothers with sleeping babies in back packs nodded intent agreement . Students led cheers at appropriate points . Suited businessmen flashed peace signs to delighted young rabble rousers . It seemed impossible on that brilliantafternoon that peace and good will could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a matter of days President Johnson would bow to the will of The People and withdraw American troops from southeast Asia . The crowds in the square , abasing themselves at the feet of the gleaming glass and steel government buildings , throbbed with brotherly love . And not the least Eddie and I , who had n't even brought our crash helmets , which at that time we reserved for use on picket lines at construction sites . As I surveyed the babies and the dogs and the mothers and the businessmen and the students and the government workers leaning out their windows , a lump rose in my throat . It was the same lump that used to rise there when , as a child , I had recited the Lord 's Prayer or sung " America the Beautiful . " We could not fail ! Eddie and I looked at each other , and then threw our arms around each other and burst into tears of joy . How sweet it was to be so right , and in such company ! The glow lasted all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we wearily climbed our dark dirty staircase , past the battereddoor behind which several children and their mother were shouting abuse . Eddie and I gazed at each other expectantly and walked hand in hand to our bed , trembling with moral and spiritual uplift from the triumphant afternoon . We enjoyed a round of incrediblypassionate sex , culminating in a breathtaking series of multiplep268orgasms , triggered by the insertion of greased little fingers into each other 's anus . From Physiology 110 , I knew that our inordinate response to this gimmick was merely a function of the reflex stretch mechanism of our anal sphincters . But I was striving mightily to forget much of what I had learned at Worthley in order to elevate my view of our love to a loftier plane than chemical secretions and genetically induced reflexes . Besides , things were going on between Eddie and me that Physiology 110 had n't covered . For instance , the way in which our bodies , immersed in smells and sounds and sights and tastes , would suddenly lurch like cars going too slow for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the realm of physical sensation . Seconds or minutes or hours passed , we never knew or cared . Exciting stuff for a country girl , but sinister , too , as I lay scarcely breathing afterwards , speculating on its similarities to my plunge down the cliff from Clem 's speeding Harley . But on the whole , I had to admit that lovemaking with Eddie agreed with me , never mind what Mother would say . The goal being so much less apparent than in heterosexual encounters , more imaginationwas required . And after that evening 's display of imagination , I decided that I had to come clean . I felt dread unhinging my joints . How could she ever lick me to orgasm again if she knew the real truth ? True , Eddie felt that the wealth should be shared , starting with my wealth . But would she still want to share blood money ? On the other hand , I knew I could n't not tell her . " Eddie ? " " Ummm ? " she sighed , wrapping her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Joe Bob had loved to do in the trunk of Doyle 's Dodge . " There 's something I have to tell you . " " Ummm ? " " Are you listening , Ed ? This is very important . " " Ummm ? Ca n't it wait ? " She nibbled my ear lobe . " No , it ca n't . I have to tell you now . I ca n't stand it any longer . " I was about to cry . " Why , what 's wrong , Ginny ? " " You know those papers I signed about my trust fund ? " " Ummm . " " Do you know where my money comes from , Eddie ? " " Where ? " she asked with a yawn.  | " Mostly from my father 's factory , that 's where . " There ! It was out . What Eddie did about it was up to her . At least I 'd leveled with her . " So what ? " So what ? Had I misunderstood Eddie 's principles somewhere along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no moral conflict in paying our expenses to antiwar marches with money generatedby supplying explosives to that war ? After all , what had Eddie been teaching me if not that logic a la Miss Head was flawed , that commitment and contradiction were the way to Truth ? Perhaps the only conflict was in my own overrational brain ? " I did n't even know your father had a factory , " Eddie murmured . " What does he make ? " Oh oh . So that was it . The truth was n't out after all . " Explosives , " I whispered in misery . " You mean like for digging mines and building highways and stuff ? " " No , I mean like for shells and bombs . I mean like for Vietnam . " No sound or movement came from Eddie for a long time . EventuallyI rolled over . Her face was frozen into a grimace . " If you want to leave me , I can understand why , " I said faintly . " I 'm sorry , Eddie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get the picture until I saw those papers . " Eddie , still grimacing , said nothing . " Can you ever love me again ? " I wailed . " Can you ? " Still she did n't answer . I looked at her closely . She had fallen asleep . If that night I dared to hope that that was the end of the matter , the next morning I discovered I was sadly mistaken . When I got up around noon , Eddie was stalking through the living room muttering , " Jesus Christ . Jesus Christ . " She resolutely refused to look at me or speak to me . I mumbled humbly several times , " I 'm sorry , Eddie . " Finally she demanded coldly , " Have you told anyone else about this ? " I nodded no miserably . " You must tell no one . Do you understand ? No one . My reputation could be ruined . " " You can count on me , " I assured her gravely , as a pigeon pecked at the chipping putty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see it , you have to cash in your stocks and invest the money in a company that makes medical supplies or artificial limbs of something . " " I ca n't . " " What do you mean you ca n't ? They 're yours , are n't they ? "  | " Yes , but I ca n't do anything with them until both my parents are dead . It 's a tax gimmick . To escape inheritance taxes . Besides , a subsidiary of the same corporation in New Jersey does make medical supplies  --  plasma bottles . " " Well , that 's something , I suppose , " she said thoughtfully . " Oh Jesus . " She resumed her trek across the listing living room . " The corruption of it all is overwhelming . I 'm so appalled that I can hardly bear looking at you , Ginny . I 've been living on profits from companiesthat are fueling the war machine ! " " I 'm sorry . I know it must make you feel so dirty . I 'd give anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've hurt the woman I love . I ca n't bear it ! " I burst into tears and collapsed onto the rickety couch , which in turn collapsed onto the floor . I lay , weeping , on the faded flowered rug . Eddie squatted down like a baseball catcher and caressed my moist face . " There , there . Do n't worry . We 'll figure something out . " What we figured out was a trip to Tennessee to picket the factory and to confront the Major with his war crimes . If I could n't divest myself of my stocks , I could at least funnel some stockholder input into the executive level . As she surveyed the huge white-columned mansion , Eddie grumbled , " Jesus . It 's downright feudal ! " Maybelle , our cook , came rushingout and whirled me across the lawn in an embrace . I tried to offer her my hand in a gesture of dignified equality instead , having read disapproval in Eddie 's face . But finally I gave in and whirled with Maybelle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Eddie in her Power to the People T-shirt , " I done been wid de Babcocks eber since Miss Virginia was two foot tall ! Law , I used to set her in mah lap an teach dat po li'l thing how to tie her shoes . . . . Why , Miss Ginny , she do n't hardly know nuthin ole Maybelle ai n't taught her . Why , I declare , iffen ... " She went on and on , her accent getting thicker and thicker , thicker than I could remember its ever having been . I studied her black face closely and thought I detected malicious pleasure in her eyes . Whether the malice was directed at Eddie or at me , I could n't be completely certain . Eddie was thoroughly scandalized . Mother showed us to our rooms . " It 's so nice to meet you , Edna . Ginny has written so many interesting things about you . "  | " Unh , " Eddie grunted . Mother had placed me in my old room , and Eddie across the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how to handle this situation in a morally upright fashion . " Mother , " I announced , blushing scarlet , " Eddie and I will be sleeping in my room . " There ! I had done it ! I had come out of the closet , and before my own mother ! Mother said gaily , " Fine , dear . Fine . You girls have a slumber party if you want to. , , I was content to let the topic drop , but Eddie kicked me with her Goliath sandal . " Ah , Mother , Eddie and I will be  --  ah  --  sleeping together in my bed . " " Yes , of course , " Mother said brightly . " That 's fine , dear . Whateversuits you girls is fine with me . " Eddie shrugged . The next day Eddie and I made a couple of signs ; they read " Workers Unite ! All Power to the People ! " and " Tennessee WestwoodCorp. : Fascist Flunkies to the Imperialist Pigs ! " We drove in the Major 's Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the chain-link fence and began to march back and forth with the signs . A security guard came out , studied the signs , and said , " I 'm afraid you girls had better move along . " Eddie bristled at being called a " girl . " " It 's all right , I 'm Major Babcock 's daughter . " " Yeah . Sure you are , " he said . I flashed a Shell credit card at him like an FBI plainclothesman and he said uncertainly , " Oh . Okay , Miss Babcock . Sorry . " Just then the noon whistle blasted . We dropped our signs to cover our ears , then picked them up just as the night shift streamed out the gates , heading for the parking lots . Several workers in their green twill work clothes studied the signs ; most did n't notice them . I recognizedfaces here and there , people I 'd been in high school with , people I just knew from a lifetime in the same town together . Two young men were studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " F  --  A  --  S  --  " one was saying . They blushed when we stopped in front of them , and glanced around nervously to see if anyone was noticing or caring that they were about to be sucked into conversation with two weird young women in Power to the People T-shirts who bore incomprehensible placards.  | " Fascist , " Eddie said for them . " Fascist , " one repeated with a dopey grin . " Whas that mean , anyhow ? " Eddie looked at him in disbelief . " Fascist ? Ah  --  well , it means , like Hitler . " " Shoot ! " one said , spitting on the sidewalk . " How do you feel about what you 're forced to make here ? " Eddie asked diplomatically , as though the two men were dwarfs out of Das Rheingold . " Explosives for Vietnam . " " Oh , is that what they 're for ? " " Yeh , dummy , " the other said , laughing and poking him in the side . " Shoot , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jes work here , thas all . They pay me an I do like they says . " " Well , I care , " the second one said . Eddie brightened . " Yes ? " " I got me a brother fightin over there , an I aim to keep his guns loaded , I can tell you that ! " " Oh , " said Eddie . " Well , do you know anyone who does n't like making stuff for Vietnam ? " The two looked at each other questioningly . " If they is any such a one , " the second one said , " I 'd better not hear about him . " We slunk off , in search of more cooperative prey . We cornered a skinny , meek-looking middle-aged man . He was standing by the chain fence , which had several strands of barbed wire across the top . When he saw us bearing down upon him , he tried to sidle away , but we had him surrounded . " Look , " he whispered nervously , holding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want no trouble . I got me five kids . " With relief I spotted Harry from Building Maintenance , whom I had n't seen since the summer I worked in the factory . He recognized me as well , in spite of my current disguise as savior of The People , and waved wildly . " Lor , I guess it 's been two year since I seed you ! I like to not knowed you . " He nodded at my wheat jeans and T-shirt and the braid down the middle of my back , Red Chinese-like . " Harry , tell me the truth now , " I said . " How do you feel about making bombs for the war ? " He sighed wearily . " Well , honey , how I feel is that hit beats the hell out of them coal pits up at Sow Gap . " " But Harry. , "  | " But I ai n't makin em , honey ! I 'm jes maintenance . Anyhow , if your daddy says hit 's right , then hit 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil , " Eddie drawled . The Major in his pin-striped suit came marching toward us at an incredible clip . I automatically flinched . " What are you girls doing ? " I blushed and shrugged sheepishly . " Virginia ! If you and your friend do n't dispose of those signs and get out of here immediately ... I 'll cut off your dividend checks ! " " You ca n't ! They 're in my name now ! " " I can do whatever I please . You seem to forget that I run this place . " " Then you can make something else besides bombs ? " I asked hopefully , not knowing that I had punched his button . " What I am doing here happens to be essential to national security , my dear child . A strong offense is the best defense . I know that some people "  --  he glanced contemptuously at Eddie  --  " would like to bring this nation to its knees and hand the keys to its portals , over to the Communists , but I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the time to point out that he was mixing his metaphors . " I fought too long and too hard against Hitler not to have learned that you ca n't allow tyranny of any political stripe to get a toe hold . Besides , what 's manufactured in this plant is n't my decision . Those decisions are made at headquarters in Boston . So why do n't you two hop the next plane back to where you came from with your idiot signs and your halfbakedpolitical opinions ? " " Bastard ! " Eddie hissed as we slunk over to the Jeep . " Christ , what a bastard ! " Back in Boston , Eddie and I concluded that the best thing for my political development would be to sever all ties with my reactionary family . They were obviously the source of all my neuroses and bourgeoispolitical attitudes . It was best never to get in touch with them again , thereby liberating myself with one deft hack from the net of capitalist hang-ups they had cast over me . " You ca n't allow your roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routs . " I got a Standard &; Poor 's sheet on Westwood Chemical Corporationand calculated the percentage of profits stemming from the Hullsportplant . Then I deducted that amount from our spending money as the quarterly dividend checks wandered in , and sent donations to free schools and people 's clinics and minority liberation groupsp274throughout Boston . Let admirable ends justify nefarious means , we decided . Eddie took further comfort in the fact that we were boycottingone aspect of the corrupt death-dealing male power structure that was perpetrating all the misery in the world by seeking our sexual fulfillment elsewhere . One April evening Eddie came galloping up the stairs . She stood in the doorway panting , distress spread over her expressive face . " What 's wrong ? " I asked nervously from the desk where I sat writing a check to a struggling head shop . " The coffee house is being torn down to build a bank ! " She lowered herself gingerly onto the sagging couch . " You 're kidding ? That 's awful ! " " But I 'm afraid there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call home has been condemned . We have to get out by next month . " " What ? Where are we supposed to go ? " We sat staring at each other , perplexed . Our cozy world was tumbling down . When the initial shock had worn off , we huddled over my checkbookand the Apartments for Rent section of the Globe . According to our calculations , either we would have to cut off our blood money donations to the Day-Glo poster shops and related enterprises and spend it for rent , or one of us would have to find a job . We both looked around halfheartedly for work for a couple of weeks . Singers of protest songs were n't in demand by that time , acid rock having taken over . And without a college degree , I could find only a waitress job at Waldorf 's Cafeteria in Harvard Square , where I had eaten Thanksgiving dinner my freshman year . Eddie was trying to persuade me that the job was a worthy one , would expose me to contact with The People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd inherited from my impossible parents , would inestimably enhance my political education . I resisted because I felt incapable any longer of keeping to a schedule . And what had Eddie been teaching me if not to honor my feelings ? With two weeks to go before we would be evicted , we decided to ignore this impasse and visit two friends of Eddie 's in Vermont . They had been seniors at Worthley when she was a sophomore and had been editors on the paper when Eddie had been a reporter . Eddie credited them with having " politicized " her . She bore them the same sentimental affection that I did Clem Cloyd for having deflowered me.  |p275Both  women , having been social workers in Newark , were now living with some other people on a farm near a town called Stark 's Bog . Mona was tall and emaciated , with wide feverish eyes which she shielded behind purple-tinted goggle lenses that made her eye sockets look bruised . She wore her black hair in a Prince Valiant cut with long bangs . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gazing through her purple lenses that made her look a little like a vulture . Atheliah was also tall , but was broad and muscled as well , with frizzy red hair that shot out like solar flares during an eclipse . She was jovial , laughing and smiling almost constantly in a way that narrowed her eyes to slits . They both embraced Eddie  --  Mona gravely and Atheliah boisterously . They lived with five men and one other woman in a crumbling white farmhouse which was attached by a sagging ell to a huge barn . In the barn , when our tour took us there , along with several decades ' worth of trampled manure were a couple of Holsteinsand some scavenging hens . The inside of the house looked like Coney Island the day after the Fourth of July . Clothes and bedding and books and papers and dishes and sleeping bodies were strewn everywhere . The damp interior walls were coated with a bright green mold . It was planting season , and Eddie and I spent most of our first afternoon helping the brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly tilled garden soil . The sun was hot , and clouds of moisture steamed up from the soggy , thawing fields . Sluggish flies buzzed languidly in the grass ; and in the distance , treed foothills tinged with the chartreuse of new leaves rose up in layer upon layer . Dinner was a murky soup , filled with dark sodden clumps that looked like leaves from the bottom of a compost pile and that tasted like decomposing seaweed , and whole grain bread which you needed diamond-tipped teeth to chew . Afterward seven of us lay around on the living room debris passing joints as two mangy barn cats climbed up on the dining table and licked our dishes clean for us . " What 's happened to you ? " Eddie demanded of Mona and Atheliah . " You two used to be the most socially concerned people I knew . I modeled myself after you . After you left Worthley , I tried to run the paper the same way you had . Articles about world affairs and stuff and not just coming-out-party portraits . And fasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this earth trip you 're on . "  | " I got tired , " Mona said languidly , holding the last quarter inch of the most recent joint between her thumb and index fingernails and sucking the smoke into her lungs through clenched teeth with a hiss . Holding her breath until her face turned a distressing purple , she squashed the glowing tip on her boot sole and leaned back and closed her alarming dark dilated eyes . " So it 's a cop-out , then ? A sort of rural rest home for fucked-over radicals ? " Eddie asked . " No , not at all , " Atheliah corrected her , in a brisk voice like Julia Child 's on " The French Chef " just after she 's dropped a roast on the floor and tossed it back on the platter . " We 're trying to live our theories . Do you know who paid my salary when I was organizing in Newark ? HEW , that 's who ! You ca n't work to overthrow a system , and live off it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parasites . First earn an honest living side by side with The People . Then talk to me about death-dealing societies and inequity and injustice ! Anythingelse is schizie . " Mona nodded in agreement , letting out her smoke in a great gush of breathlessness . She wove into the kitchen and fumbled around in the freezer and returned with a plastic container of frozen Magic Mushrooms . " ' Teonanactl , ' the Aztecs called them , " Mona muttered , litanylike , as she passed them . " ' God 's flesh , ' the key to communion with the Deity . " Hesitantly I took one of the icy chunks and pondered the topic of eating God , turning the mushroom in my fingers and staring at it with distaste . " What 's the matter ? Do n't you do drugs ? " Mona asked incredulously , poised to cross me off their Christmas card list . " Of course she does , " Eddie assured them . My upbringing won out over my eagerness to please Eddie : I did n't trust pushers ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog tranquilizer . If I ate this thing , I would die a horrible death on the floor of this remote Vermont farmhouse . Feigning a bite , I held it down by my side and offered it to the cats , who sniffed it and then wanted nothing to do with it either . Eddie was clearly impressed by Atheliah 's line of reasoning . She looked thoughtful for the rest of our visit and asked a lot of questions about gardening and animal care and land prices . " Are Mona and Atheliah , like  --  simpatico , sexually ? " I asked Eddieas we slouched in our bus seats on the way back to Boston . Ourp277knees were propped on the seat backs in front of us . Soggy meadows and evergreen forests and mountain peaks with faint remnants of snow flashed by the bus windows . " Well , they 're not asimpatico , which is all that matters , is n't it ? " " What does that mean ? " " They 're not lovers , if that 's what you 're asking . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can tell . I think that 's the bond between them . " " How dull . " " Do you think so ? I find it refreshing . " We glared at each other with hostility , at having come to need each other physically . " How did they come to be so blessed ? " " Well , I remember Mona had this  --  male friend when she was at Worthley . A medical student he was . She used to meet him in the morgue when he was on night duty at some Boston hospital , and they 'd make love all night on a stretcher in the office . " " At least they did n't have to worry about getting caught , " I said , weak with distaste . A morgue was almost as creepy a site for sex as a bomb shelter . " Ah , but they did get caught ! She became pregnant . I remember the day she told me . We were sitting in the newspaper office correctingthe proofs of an editorial on the Free Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and started weeping . I could n't believe it . I 'd always thought of Mona as this paragon of restraint . Well , it all came out in a great gush of confession . And then she sat up and blew her nose and set about trying to blot the tear-soaked proofs . ' What are you going to do ? ' I asked . ' Leave school and get married of course , ' she said curtly . Well , she disappeared one weekend , and then returned looking all gray and haggard . And she never said another word about it . She was on my hall , and as far as I know , she never went out on a date again  --  not with her medical student or with anyone else . I never felt at liberty to ask her about it . " " Could n't you have asked Atheliah ? " " No . I never felt I could . For all I knew , Atheliah did n't even know about it . Anyhow , it was n't the sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin I know . " " Has she told you she is ? " " No , of course not . I 'm just , like , speculating . " Back in Boston we continued our search for jobs , or for an apartmentwe could afford on my unsupplemented dividend checks . Ourp278search took us one afternoon to an area of Boston I 'd never seen before . Even though it was a sunny afternoon , the streets we were walking down were dark and damp , permanently shielded from the sun by towering expressway ramps overhead . Trash cans were overflowing ; and the facades of the formerly elegant townhouses , with crumbling plaster cupids in their cornices , were grimy and bleak . A blanket of damp exhaust fumes lay over the section . Eddie was unusually quiet as we searched for an address listed in the paper as containing a cheap two-room apartment . As we passed a flight of concrete steps that descended , into a dark basement , Eddie said grimly , " That was the site of my conception . " " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a drunk collapsed in a nearby doorway and trying to picture this as my new neighborhood . " Down in that cellar . That 's where my father , whoever he was , raped my mother . " I asked carefully , " Uh , how do you know ? " We stopped and stared down the grungy steps and into the recessed doorway , which was strewn with empty liquor bottles and broken glass . She laughed bitterly . " How do I know ? It 's the family shrine , that 's how . My mother used to bring me here and point it out when I was a teen-ager . As an instructive exercise about the male of the species , in whom I was exhibiting an inordinate interest at the time . " " You mean you lived around here ? " " Five blocks east , " she said with a defiant look . " Does that appall you , Scarlett ? " She 'd taken to calling me Scarlett , after Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind , every time I displayed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " She sighed with disgust . " Does it matter where I grew up ? You grew up in a mansion with slaves , and I grew up in a slum . So what ? " Feeling that she was being unusually charitable about my feudal origins , I nodded in eager agreement . We stood frozen to the spot , gazing down the steps , picturing the rape scene with loathing for the male animal in our hearts . " He held a knife to her throat , " Eddie added in a choked voice . " She was fifteen . On her way home from school late one afternoon in early spring . She wanted to be a hairdresser , but she had to drop out of school when she turned out to be pregnant with me. "  | " Could n't she have had an abortion ? " " Are you kidding ? In 1944 ? In Massachusetts ? With no bread ? " " She 's not very old then . Does she still live around here ? " Eddie nodded . " Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother . After all , you 've met mine . And it is a rather crucial factor in a person 's life , as we all know from Psychology 101 . " " You would n't like to meet my mother . " " Oh , but I would . " " No , " Eddie said abruptly . " I have n't seen her for a year or more . Families are a real bummer . " " Please . " " No ! " I looked at her with surprise . Her face was twitching with suppressed emotion . " We 've got to get out of here , " she said , grabbingmy hand and dragging me back the way we 'd come . A month later we were living in a rented prefab log cabin on a farm adjacent to Mona 's and Atheliah 's . The cabin sat on a hill overlookingan eighteen-acre beaver pond . A wide meadow of timothy stretched from the cabin to the thicket of cattails at the pond edge . Out of the pond pointed the dead gray branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an area cleared of the skeletal trees , was the mud lodge where the beavers lived . The evening of our arrival , with our possessions in a U-Haul truck , Eddie and I sat in rush-seated rocking chairs on the front porch . I was leaning back , my feet propped on a log railing . Eddie sat behind me gravely smoothing and rebraiding my hair . The sun had set in a red smear behind the tree-covered cliffs that formed a backdrop to the pond , and a dense mist was rising up from the pond surface and enveloping the gray trunks . Eddie and I sighed simultaneously with contentment as she stroked my frizzy hair into orderly plaitable bundles . " What do you think ? " I asked . " I think we 're finally getting our heads straight . " But of course we 'd only just arrived . Compared to Broadway in Cambridge , our rutted dirt road in Stark 's Bog , Vermont , was the end of the earth . Little did we know that we 'd moved onto a battlefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untainted bliss . We felt we 'd come home at last , only now realizing how far astray we 'd gone . We had renounced our pasts totally by not leaving a forwardingp280address at the Cambridge post office ( except of course with the WestwoodChemical Corporation , so that they would know where to send the checks ) . The cabin stood on the site of an old farmhouse , which had burned down . It had been built only a few years earlier as a summer retreat and winter ski house by a stockbroker in New York City . It was unclear why he was willing to rent such a slice of heaven , though it became clearer as time went on . But the original farmhouse had belonged to several generations of working farmers , so that the barn nearby was in good condition . We rushed out and bought a Guernsey milking cow named Minnie and half a dozen red and black Rhode Island hens and a vicious black and white Barred Rock rooster . All these we ensconced in the huge moldy old barn , the framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beehive and nailed it together and dumped a package of bees from Kentucky into it . We placed the hive in an old apple orchard behind the house ; the blossoms had recently fallen off , and tiny green apples were forming . The growing season well under way , we dug and planted a hasty garden , reading instructions from a manual . We had left behind The Family and The City . The plan now , according to Eddie , our resident theoretician , was to leave behind the American capitalist-imperialist economy altogether . We would grow and make almost all our material requirements  --  our food , our clothes , our fuel . Inconvenient expenses like taxes we would cover from our maple sugaring operation in early spring , there being a vast sugar bush and a sugar shack filled with all the necessary equipment on a high hill behind the cabin . By saving my dividend checks , we could soon afford a down payment on the farm , which was for sale at a ludicrously low price , for reasons which too soon became apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wean ourselves entirely from that corporate enemy of The People , the Westwood Chemical Corporation . We concluded that very soon we would be able authentically to cast our lot with The People . As far as representatives of The People went in Stark 's Bog , we did n't know any . We had been into town several times in the old Ford pickup owned by Mona and Atheliah to buy supplies . As we clattered and jounced down the hill on which our farms sat , we could see Stark 's Bog below us . Frame buildings clustered around three sides of the bog that gave the town its name . In most parts of Vermont could be seen houses of brick and stone , built to last for generations . In Stark'sp281Bog , however , every house was frame , except Ira Bliss 's stone one . Apparently none of the early settlers except the Blisses had planned to stay if they could help it . In the winter , according to Mona and Atheliah , the marsh mud in the bog froze over . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals that strayed into it were trapped and sucked under , like mammoth elephants in prehistoric asphalt pits . Now , however , it was summer , and the marsh grasses rustled . The mud had grown a coat of brilliant green slime . Mosquitoes teemed in fetid pools . Driving into town we would first pass the Dairy Delite soft ice cream stand . The Stark 's Boggers would cluster here after supper to buy root beer floats or butterscotch sundaes . Then they would drive or walk to the bog to watch the struggles of whatever animals were sinking in the goo offshore . Or if it was close to 6:27 , they would amble to the train track and wait for the New York  --  Montreal special to roar through . ( It had never stopped there . In fact , passengers tended to pull down their window shades as they passed through , to the disappointment of the frantically waving town children . ) Athough Stark 's Bog township actually included the bog and the surrounding hills and farms , the town proper consisted of one road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border crossing into Quebec . Where the road passed through town , it was lined with a feed store , a hardware store , a hotel where hunters stayed in the fall , an IGA grocery store , a gun shop , a taxidermy parlor , a funeral home , a farm equipment franchise , and a snow machine showroom called Sno Cat City . All these were housed in buildings from the early 1800 's with colonial cornices and returns and doorways , which were pleasing in their simplicity . Pleasing to everyone but the Stark 's Boggers , who were sick to death of them and had done their best to tear them down or cover them over with fluorescent plastic and neon tubing and plate glass and gleaming chrome . Each businessman yearned to raze the clapboard and beam structure on his premises and erect a molded plastic- and aluminum-sided showroom in its place . Sno Cat City , for instance , owned by Ira Bliss IV , had a huge orange mountain lion springing out from its facade ; it being summer , row after row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goal of each Stark 's Bog householder was to knock down or sell the despised frame colonial his family had infested for centuries , and to throw up a prefab ranch house that would be airtight , with everything working properly.  |p282We  found all this profoundly disturbing . It indicated a willingness to participate in modern American society . We did n't approve at all , and so we went into Stark 's Bog as little as possible . When we did , the Stark 's Boggers eyed us  --  as we strolled from the feed store to the hardware store in our Off the Pigs T-shirts , with our braids swishing behind us in unison  --  with all the enthusiasm of Incas inspecting newly arrived Spaniards . We learned from Mona that they referred to us all as the Soybean People due to the fact that we bought fiftypoundsacks of soybeans at the feed store for our own consumption , not for our animals . Eddie had decided that it was politically reprehensibleof us not to be vegetarians when each fattened steer starved five Third World citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked , as she burned all our cookbooks containing meat recipes in the wood stove . " We should be able to make it on our own life force without holding innocent animals in bondage . " It did n't take long for things to start going sour  --  not more than a couple of blissful sunlit months . One problem was that the regimens of farming did n't fit our lifestyle . One morning Eddie went to the barn to collect some fresh eggs for breakfast , while I put a cast iron skillet on the burner of the wood cookstove and fed the coals from the night before into a modest fire . Intending to scramble the eggs , I cracked one on the rim of a bowl . A foul odor wafted up to me . I opened the shell and dumped its contents into the bowl . It was tinged with brown and stank . " Uh , Ed , I think they 're rotten . " She stalked over and peered into the bowl and nearly gagged . I broke open a couple more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe collecting them once a week is n't enough ? " I suggested . " Shit ! I 'm damned if I 'm going to spend my whole fucking lifecollecting eggs ! " She collapsed in a captain 's chair in front of thestove . It would n't take more than a few minutes every other day if we took turns , " I pointed out . " Turns ! Schedules ! Lists ! Did anyone ever tell you that you have an accountant mentality , Ginny ? I suppose you 'd like to mark on a calendar when to have sex , too ? " I had n't found it easy sharing a bathroom with a member of The Elect all these years , and thy accumulated resentments poured out in response to this unwarranted attack . " An accountant mentality ! Well , it 's a goddam good thing that somebody in this place does ! If I weren'tp283around to pay your bills , Eddie , you 'd be out on your ass so fast  --  " " There ! " Eddie said triumphantly , gesturing toward me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it all along ! I knew that deep down you resented sharing your fucking blood money with me . You grasping bourgeois types are all the same . I can read you like a book ! " " Oh yeah ? " I screamed , standing over her , a quivering mass of bourgeois rage . " I do n't notice you making any efforts to earn honest money , Miss Holier Than Thou ! You seem perfectly content to let me pay your way with my despised blood money ! " " Your money , my money ! Who gives a shit about your goddam fucking money ? Shove it up your ass , Scarlett . " She slouched lower in her chair and glowered . " Get out ! Get out , you freeloader ! I 'm paying the rent , this is my place . And I do n't need you around calling me grasping ' and ' bourgeois ' while you live off me , like the cock-sucking parasite you are ! " I had never before let the phrase " cock-sucking " pass my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my days with Clem . Eddie looked startled , but no more startled than I. We stared at each other in mutual shock . " So that 's it , " Eddie said , nodding her head knowingly . " What 's it ? " " You know as well as I do from Psychology 101 , Ginny , that there 's more at stake here than rotten eggs or who pays the rent . And I 've just realized what it is . " " What is it ? " " You 're tired of me , Ginny . You want a man . A cock , " she added with distaste . " No ! That 's not true ! " " I 've been expecting it . You do n't need to deny it . It was bound to happen sooner or later . You 've just been playing around with me . Basically you 're as hetero as they come . " " But you 're wrong , Eddie . You 're all I want . With one functioning lover , what would I want with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person endure ? " I knelt beside her chair and began massaging her throbbing temples . " It 's no use , " Eddie said glumly , pushing my hands away . " What 's done is done . " " But nothing 's done , Eddie , " I protested with a laugh . " What do I want with a man ? I 've had men . You 're so far superior as a lover ,  |p284and  in every other way , that it 's ridiculous even to talk about it . " I kissed her on the mouth tenderly . This was followed by an embrace . " You 're crazy , Eddie , " I whispered fondly in her ear . " I guess I am . " Lacking eggs , I dished us up bowls of molded soybean salad left over from the night before . There was a great deal left over , almost the entire salad , in fact . We ate in silence at the table , which overlookedthe beaver pond . I kept trying not to breathe as I ate so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Delicious , " Eddie said firmly , trying to convince herself . " Delicious , " I echoed faintly . " And full of protein . " The summer sun shone down bright and hot on the pond . Shimmeringheat waves rose up all around the cabin . Bees bumbled in the weed flowers that were thigh-high in the yard . " I was wondering , Eddie , " I said between hastily swallowed bites , " if we maybe should n't rent a power tiller for the garden down at the hardware store . " The garden we had so carefully planted was now overrun with weeds . We had to do something quick  --  either get rid of the weeds , or get used to them in lieu of tomatoes . " Are you kidding ? A power tiller ? Are you out of your mind ? You do n't actually want to patronize an economy that turns The People into interchangeable cogs in some vast assembly line , do you ? You could n't possibly want to participate in a system of production that makes medical supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , that 's why we 're up here , is n't it , to wean ourselves from that sort of hypocrisy , to become honest working-class people ? Well , is n't it ? " I said nothing . I was n't at all sure that that was why I was in Vermont . I reviewed my motives and concluded that I was mostly here because Eddie wanted to be , for reasons of her own , and I wanted to be with Eddie . Once again I was shamelessly allowing myself to be defined by another person . I was afraid it would sound at best hopelessly bougie ( Eddie 's shorthand for " bourgeois " ) if I admitted this  --  and counterrevolutionary at worst . So instead I asked meekly , " Yes , but what about the weeds ? " " We 'll pull them by hand , " Eddie announced grandly , " like every person in the Third World does ! " That afternoon , shirtless , sweat pouring out of our hairy armpits , we pulled weeds in the hot sun for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our bodies clammy with sweat , we lay under an apple tree and smoked a joint . " If tomatoes ca n't prevail against the weeds , they do n't deserve to live , " Eddie concluded . " To pull the weeds would be to weaken the tomatoes and make them dependent on us . " " Maybe it 's too late . I think they 're already corrupted . They appearto need us . " The apples hanging above us were tinged with pink . Because we had failed to prune the trees or to control the insects , they were tiny and deformed and riddled with worm holes . We turned over on our stomachs so that we would n't have to look at yet another tribute to our ineptitude . " We may not be freeing up our former food supplies for shipment to the Third World , " I said , " but we 're sure providing one hell of a feast for the area insects . " When Eddie looked at me , I knew that my remark had n't been amusing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she demanded . " We 're just picking up on all this soil shit . We 'll get it together for next summer . " We passed the joint and became less and less glum . We glanced off and on at the beehive under a neighboring tree . At least we would have honey . We had left the bees almost entirely alone , in keeping with our policy of letting things fend for themselves . Only the bees had come through under this regime . They were rushing in and out with loads of nectar and pollen . Talk about accountant mentalities ... . " We should do more hives next year , " Eddie said , yawning . " That 's my kind of project . " She rolled over and wrapped her arms around me and nibbled my neck . Eddie and I went one day to Mona 's and Atheliah 's for an autumnalequinox party . The plan was that we would all help them harvest their crops , and then we would have a big feed . I took soybean croquettes creole as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen people in various stages of undress were lolling around in the weed patch that was their front lawn . I recognizedabout half the people as being in Mona 's and Atheliah 's group . The others were from nearby farms . Marijuana smoke hung around the group like a London pea-soup fog . A woman in a long Indian shirt with hair to her waist was plucking a dulcimer and singing a Kentuckyp286coal mining song with a Brooklyn accent : " I hope when I 'm gone and the ages shall roll , / My body will blacken and turn into coal. / Then I 'll look from the door of my heavenly home/ And pity the miner digging my bones/ Where it 's dark as a dungeon , damp as the dew , / Where the danger is double , the pleasures are few , / Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines/ It 's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines . " I felt a passing seizure of nostalgia for the mines of Appalachia that I had never known . Genes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within each of my cells . A shirtless man with a Simon Legree mustache was silk-screening " Power to the People " in white on his dark blue T-shirt . Atheliah was stirring something in a big cast iron pot that sat in the middle of a small fire . A naked boy baby was tottering around with his arms outstretchedfor his mother , whom he could n't locate . I handed my earthenware dish to Mona , who lifted the lid and sniffed and said , " Soybeans . Far out . " After a while a few people wandered out to the corn patch , which was almost as full of weeds as our tomato patch . Eddie sat down next to the woman with the dulcimer and started harmonizing . I went out to the corn patch to help pick . We ripped the ears off the stalks , shucked them , and tossed them in a cart . They were mostly four inches long and etched with brown worm tracks . Halfway through the patch , Laverne , a woman in Mona 's house , found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small football . Laverne was statuesque . There was no other word for her . Her shapely hips and large breasts strained the seams of her T-shirt and jeans . She had long blond naturally curly hair and blue eyes . In another era she would have been a movie starlet , a model for Rubens . She held up her squash triumphantly . " A football ! " gasped a bearded man with bleary eyes , who looked like Sherman on his march through Georgia . He grabbed the squash , faded back , and passed it to another man , who wore nothing but jeans , which were too large for him and were bunched together and held up with a belt fashioned from a silk rep tie . " Keep-away , " he suggested . " Shirts against the skins . " Weglanced around . Five of us wore shirts ; three men were shirtless . Laverne threw off her T-shirt with one smooth upward movement . " I 'll be a skin ! " Everyone stood transfixed , staring with awe at her magnificent brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trying to pretend that we had n't been staring , that we all saw bare bosoms this breathtaking every day , that the female chest was no big deal to people as sexually liberated as we , we began a frantic game of keep-away through the corn patch , trampling the juicy green stalks and passing and handing off the squash as we went . Everyone was clandestinely sneaking glimpses of Laverne 's breasts , bouncingfirmly as she ran and gleaming bronze under the September sun . The game got progressively rougher , and soon people were tacklingeach other and grappling in the dirt , over the squash . At one point I lay trying to catch my breath after a savage tackle by General Sherman . As I picked myself up , I saw that the game had moved from the garden and into the high grass . Laverne , her jeans hanging on her hips just above her pubic hair , was dancing in place signaling to the man with the tie belt to throw her the squash . Her arms were raised high over her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking in place like Jell-O . The squash was flying through the air . Laverne leapt up to catch it . As she did , she was hit from three sides by male tacklers . The squash sailed over her head and smashed open , spilling its orange guts on the grass . Laverne herself landed on her back in the dirt with her jeans to her knees . I watched in amazement as the bearded man threw himself on her and started lunging his hips into hers . I heard her gasping and shrieking . Shortly , he rolled off and another man climbed on , like a cowboy trying to ride a bronco . I glanced back toward the house . A couple of people watched indifferently . No one seemed concerned . But from where I stood , with my mouth hanging open , it looked for all the world like what Clem used to call a gang bang . They were like a pack of mongrels balling a bitch in heat . Laverne was being raped and no one was helping ! I ran closer , speculating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I was ten yards away , I could see that her legs were sprawled open and her whole luscious body was smeared with dirt and sweat and semen . I could also hear what she was screaming : " Faster ! Faster ! Do n't stop now , you mother fucker ! Oh mother of Christ ! Do n't stop . " Her body was arcing up off the ground and twitching spasmodically , like a frog 's leg hooked into an electric current . Three men lay in panting heaps next to her , like bees after stinging.  |p288I  stopped running to her assistance and stood frozen to the spot . As I watched , blood rushed to my face . My nipples began tingling with excitement . I realized I wanted to join the fray , but whether on top of Laverne or underneath the men I was no longer certain . Dividedloyalties . I turned around and walked slowly back toward the house , breathingdeeply to quell my beast . I sat down next to Eddie , who was scowling. " ... really disgusting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at me . But I said nothing . Later Eddie and I passed by Atheliah 's cast iron pot and got a bowl of soup . " Dr. Dekleine 's Victory Soup , " Atheliah informed us . " Brewer'syeast , powdered milk , and toasted soy flour . Delicious . And packed with protein . " We sat on the steps , and Eddie said casually , " You liked it , did n't you ? " " Liked what ? " " Laverne 's charming number in the corn patch . " " Oh , that . " " I saw you standing there watching and getting off on it . " " I thought they were raping her . I was worried . " " You do n't need to worry about Laverne . It 's you I 'm worried about . " " Me ? " " Admit it . You loved it . You wanted to be right in there with them . Did n't you ? " " It occurred to me . " " I knew it ! You 're tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured her without conviction . " Can I help it if I do n't have a penis ? " " Of course not , " I said wearily . " I 've told you that it does n't matter to me . There are all sorts of compensations to being with you instead of a man . " " Compensations ? Compensations ? Go ahead , Scarlett . Go drag one of those young studs on his macho trip out into the woods with you ! I dare you to ! You 'll come crawling back to me in minutes ! Go on ! " " Maybe I will . " Under Eddie 's abuse , I was becoming more interested in the idea all the time . That night we walked back to our cabin in an icy silence , me withp289the crusted soybean croquette dish under my arm . We climbed into bed and turned our backs on each other . Later that night I woke up being caressed by Eddie . Warm tears were dripping from her eyes and onto my bare chest . " Do n't leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it if I knew you were with a man . I get sick just thinking about it . Do n't do it to us . " Reflexively , I took her in my arms , and we kissed and held each other . She parted my knees and began stroking me . On the verge of orgasm , I felt something hard and cold slide into me and start moving back and forth . It felt fantastic . Curiosity finally quelling lust , I sat up and said , " What are you doing , Eddie ? " I turned on the light . She smiled sheepishly and held up a greased cucumber . I looked at her with horror . " It 's all right , " she assured me . " It 's organically grown . " The incident with Laverne , as unimpressed as people had seemed by it at the time , had repercussions far beyond those on Eddie 's and my relationship . For one thing , Mona and Atheliah moved in with us the following week . " We did n't want to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we sat in captain 's chairs around our wood stove the night of their arrival . The autumn air was chilly , and we had a small fire going . " You mean  --  she 's there with all those men just . . . ? " Eddie asked with uncharacteristic delicacy . As Mona nodded with a sardonic smile , Eddie shuddered . " Well , I can certainly understand your leaving . You 're welcome to live with us for as long as you like . " " Be fair , Mona , " Atheliah said . " It was n't just Laverne . This has been building up for a long time . " Atheliah was sharpening her ax on a whetstone , testing the blade with her callused thumb . Occasionally she 'd put it down to smoke a cigarette , which she 'd hold between her thumb and index finger , cupping the glowing butt in her huge hand . Mona nodded in agreement . She was smoking a joint , had inhaled deeply and was holding her breath . Her face was turning dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her bruised-looking eyes were beginning to glaze over behind her purple lenses . " It got to be a total turn-off , " Atheliah continued . " They wanted to fart around in the garden all day and come in to find that the womenfolk had hot meals waiting for them . " " Nof " said Eddie . She picked up her chair and moved it behindp290mine . Sitting with a knee on either side of my chair , she began unbraiding my hair carefully . " Yes , " Atheliah confirmed . " Or one of them would say , peremptorily , ' Mona ? ' And would point to his cup to indicate that he wanted more tea . It was totally unreal . " " I ca n't believe it , " Eddie said . " I know , but it 's true , " Atheliah insisted . " They 're on a real macho trip over there  --  me Tarzan , you Jane . " " What it comes down to , " Mona said in a gush of exhaled smoke , is that Atheliah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laverne gets her rocks off on this macho stuff , but it 's a total turn-off for us . " " Turn-off is n't the word for it , " Eddie said with disgust . She was brushing out my tangled hair with short sharp brush strokes . " It 's not their fault , " I suggested , speaking from personal experience . " It 's how they were brought up , with their masochistic mothers hovering over them anticipating their every need . They 're macho , I 'm bougie . We ca n't help ourselves . " " That 's cool , " Mona agreed , hunched over with her elbows on her chair arms and her dark hair hanging in her eyes . " But at what point do the obnoxious personality traits that have survived your childhood start being your own responsibility , rather than your par-ents ' ? " We all sat meditating upon this question and listening to the hypnotic grinding whir of Atheliah 's ax on the whetstone . Eddie got up and shoved a log into the stove . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of hair , which crackled with electricity . A window rattled in its frame , and a few flakes of early snow whirled past . The effect of the grinding fell somewhere between a back rub and fingernails skittering across a blackboard . " Jesus , " Mona sighed , sinking lower in her chair and sticking her feet out straight . " I 'm really getting off on that grinding . It 's enough to totally bliss me out . " After a few more minutes , having finally satisfied herself as to the sharpness of her blade , Atheliah oiled it and sheathed it in a tan leather case , for all the world like a mother bathing and oiling and dressing a well-loved baby . " Thanks for taking us in , " Atheliah said . " It feels good having you here , " Eddie said . " And we could use a couple more backs on the land . " I laughed . " What 's so funny ? " Eddie asked affectionately.  | " It 's just that I have n't been referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , a cunt , a piece of ass . But never a back . It 's refreshing , to say the least . " The next morning Atheliah showed us how to fell trees . There had been a small supply of firewood on the front porch when we arrived , but it had almost all been used for cooking . Now that autumn was upon us , we needed wood for heat . It unsettled both Eddie and me that we had n't realized this fact until recently  --  that we had taken heat for granted , as something supplied automatically by one 's landlord . Luckily , we now had two extra " backs . " Dressed in a red plaid lumberjack shirt and olive army fatigue pants and green rubber boots , Atheliah flicked the ax blade with her thumb to test it , as though she had n't spent an hour the previous evening honing it to razor sharpness . She planted her legs firmly and raised her treasured ax in both hands high over one shoulder like a baseball bat . Her frozen breath encircled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she brought the ax down diagonally on a birch trunk . Working the ax back and forth , she withdrew it from the trunk and swung again . A large triangular chunk of white barked wood flew out . Half a of the tree and whacked out a chunk slightly higher than the original cut . The tree listed slowly . Atheliah threw her shoulder against it , and it came crashing down . " Where did you learn that ? " Eddie asked in awe . " I used to be a Curved Bar Girl Scout back in Ohio , " Atheliah admitted . " Far out , " Eddie said . Mona took the ax and began deftly trimmingoff branches . Her chopping technique was less dramatic than Atheliah 's , but was equally effective ; she chopped with short quick strokes , her back hunched , throwing up a shower of tiny wood chips . When the flurry of chips settled , the log was cut to order . A pattern developed at the Free Farm , as we had come to call the place . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then as I did the dishes , Eddie and Atheliah and Mona would hitch up the work horses we had bought and would go up the hill to the woodlot . We soon had nearly enough wood for the winter , but the others wanted to fill the wood bin at the sugar shack now so that everything would be ready for sugaring in late February . While they were up the hill , I stayed at the cabin and cleaned . I also spun and dyed wool , andp292used it to crochet rainbow curtains for our bare windows . I felt like Snow White , the others of course being the dwarfs . And by the time I heard the clanking of the horses ' harnesses coming down the hill , I would have a hearty lunch ready  --  soybean fritters or sprouted soybean sukiyaki or soy grits pilaf . Each noon we four would sit at our groaning board , as I 'd serve up a new culinary delight . Everyone would take a cautious bite , wait for a moment , and then Eddie would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Delicious , " the other two would echo . " And so much roughage , " one would add . One morning as I sat crocheting the violet band of my fifth rainbowcurtain , there was a knock at the door . I was startled because I had n't heard any car or truck arrive . When I opened the door , there was Laverne , a knapsack on her back and a duffel bag in her hand , looking luscious in faded bib overalls and a flannel shirt , with her curly blond hair waving around her fresh face . " Hi , Ginny . " " What do you want ? " I asked , trying to sound disapproving . " To move in with you all . " " You 're kidding ? What 's wrong ? Did your boy friends kick you out ? " " I 'm through with men forever ! I 've had it with them ! " I looked at her suspiciously , but stood aside and let her enter . She dumped her gear on the floor and looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model of cleanliness compared to the disaster area she had just fled from . " I do n't know , Laverne . I do n't know if you can stay or not . You 'll have to see what the others say . They 'll be back for lunch soon . " " I know they do n't care for my sexual proclivities . " She had a habit of wetting her lower lip with her tongue and then slowly rubbing the lip with her middle finger . " That 's putting it mildly . " " But that 's over . I 've reformed . I never want another man again as long as I live . " Just then the others entered , clomping across my clean floor in their muddy boots . " Take off your boots ! " I shrieked , like a housewife on a daytime TV commercial . They all bent over to remove their boots , but one by one they became aware of Laverne 's presence . Finally Eddie said , " Well , well . If it is n't the Wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lascivious presence in our chaste abode ? " Laverne giggled nervously . " She wants to move in , " I explained " Here ? " the three asked simultaneously . " I never want to see another man . " " He can do whatever he wants to with you just so long as you do n't have to see him ? " Eddie inquired . " Honestly . I 'm through with men . They 're just one disappointmentafter another . Their readiness and their stamina are just so unreliable . Believe me , I just want to be left alone with my vibrator . " We all laughed at this , yet another example of job obsolescence , men being replaced by their machines . Then we stopped laughing as we sat down to curried soybean cutlets . The time had come , we decided , to involve ourselves with The People . We had kept to ourselves for too long , allowing a mythology to spring up among the Stark 's Boggers : The Soybean People were Communists , lesbians , draft dodgers , atheists , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Free Farmlet going . But now the sparse stunted produce from our overgrown garden was in jars and trays of sand in the musty dirt cellar . Wood for the cabin and for the sugar shack was cut and split and stacked . It was time to descend into Stark 's Bog and mix and mingle with the folk with whom we had cast our lot . It was time to win over their heads and their hearts to The Revolution ! Our first gesture of solidarity was to attend the local blood drawing , which was being held at the grammar school . It was here that I first saw Ira face to face . I 'm sure I must have seen him earlier  --  he being one of the active young businessmen about town , president of the Stark 's Bog Volunteer Fire Department , veteran square dancer with the Wheelers ' n ' Reelers , and member of the Stark 's Bog CemeteryCommission . But it is from the blood drawing that I retain my first clear picture of him . The five of us walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool lumberjack shirts and khaki army fatigue pants and green rubber boots . A hush fell over the large room as we gave our names to the kindly gray-haired lady behind the table . We sat side by side in folding chairs , waiting to be called for medical histories by a white-starched volunteer nurse . Part of the gym was occupied byp294wooden pallets on wheels with plastic bags strapped to their sides . Tubes led from the bags and into the arms of the supine Stark 's Boggers . In one corner was a refreshment area , where the survivors stood chatting and munching doughnuts . I recognized the bag boy from the IGA , the owner of the feed store , a farmer down the road from us , a couple of other familiar faces . It gave me a great feeling of kinship to know that my plastic bag would nestle in the blood bank next to theirs . We were all in this business of life together . One by one we were called for a conference with the nurse . Eventually , we lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our community  --  blood that would go into the veins of Vermont farmers who had had tractor accidents , Vermont women hemorrhaging during childbirth , Vermont children cut by their sled runners . We felt very good about the whole thing .. Afterwards we mingled with our neighbors , endlessly exchanging such profundities as " Cold enough for you ? " and " Looks like snow clouds blowing in from the north . " After doughnuts and Coke , we headed for the door . There , handing out small red plastic hearts , was Ira Bliss IV , Missouri Mutual Insurance agent and owner of Sno Cat City . He looked like Victor Mature in the The Robe , with high cheekbones and a firm mouth with full lips and wide dark alarmed eyes with bushy eyebrows that gave him a perpetually startled expression . His dark wavy hair hung so as partially to conceal a high forehead . His forehead and cheeks were ruddy and gleamed with sweat , making him look as though he 'd just come up from some enforced rowing in the galley of a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tight , so that his biceps and chest muscles rippled the shirt when he moved . Three buttons were undone , and shocks of black curly chest hair peeked out . He stood just inside the doorway , his nostrils flaring like a race horse 's . In retrospect , I could swear that he and I exchangedlingering stares fraught with meaning . At the time , though , I merely stood still and allowed him to pin the plastic heart to the collar of my lumberjack shirt , like a young man 's pinning a corsage on his date . When he had pinned the hearts on all five of us , he nodded and said , " Thank you , girls , for helping out our boys in Vietnam . " In unison we did a double take . " Is that what happens to it ? " Eddie asked . " I thought it was for the blood bank that serves our area . " " Usually it is , " he said with a pleasant smile . " But today is a special drawing for American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back to the truck . We rode to the cabin in a politically uncomfortable silence , and not entirely because of Ira 's patriarchal faux pas in referring to us women as " girls . " The next time I saw Ira was under considerably less friendly circumstances , in our birth control information center on Main Street . Our personal finances had started rankling : We had continued to send checks to underground theater groups and counterculture coffee houses in Boston . But , not being there to survey their operations , Eddie had become uneasy . She insisted that a drug rehabilitation center we were helping was a front for FBI infiltration of radical politics . So we abruptly cut them off . Besides , we wanted to brighten our own immediate corner . Each time we had ventured into town for supplies , we had seen women our own age , grossly overweight with no teeth and greasy hair , being dragged in four directions at once by as many small children . These women were our sisters . They merited our help more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rented a vacant shop . We furnished it with castoffs and stocked it with free literature on " family management " from Planned Parenthood . We put a sign out front that euphemistically read " Family Planning Center . " One of us was there at all times during working hours , prepared to discuss birth control devices and to refer women to the local doctor to acquire one . We also planned to refer women under the table to sympathetic doctors in Montreal for illegal abortions and to lobby at the statehouse in Montpelier to liberalize the state abortion laws . All of us did these things except Mona , who explained one night , " Kill yourself first , but do n't have an abortion . Not if the father is a man you love , or have loved . It 's like ripping off one of your own limbs and stomping on it . " " Sometimes you have to sacrifice a limb for the well-being of the tree , " Eddie replied curtly . After ten days , we had had two clients . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaked through the door , glancing nervously up and down the street to be sure she was n't being observedby her friends and neighbors . " May I help you ? " I inquired cordially , as she stood squirming in front of the desk . " I  --  I want to do it , " she stuttered , blushing . " Yes , certainly , " I said , assuming that she was a young virginp296about to embark upon the treacherous sea of sexuality , a high school girl perhaps whose illegitimate pregnancy I would prevent . " Wo n't you have a seat ? " She perched tentatively , prepared to flee . " Now ! " I began , searching for tactful terminology . " Your  --  partner , have you known him long ? " She looked at me strangely . " Well , yes . I mean , we been married four years , but nothing happens . " I pondered this revelation carefully . " You mean you  --  uh  --  " I broke into a sweat . The girl 's eyes whirled in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . You 've been married four years , you say . But you 've never  --  ah  --  done it ? " When in doubt , resort to the client 's phraseology . " Done what ? " " Well , you know . " I had used the verb " to fuck " for so long that I could n't remember its socially acceptable synonym . " It . " " It ? " " Well , when you came in , you said you wanted to ' do it . ' " " Yes . Plan my family , " she mumbled . " It said on the sign ' Family Planning Center . ' Is this the wrong place ? " " No , no , " I assured her hastily . " Yes , that 's what we do here all right  --  plan families . Now , all right , yes . Four years you 've been married , you say ? Yes , so what have you been  --  using , as it were ? " " Using ? Using for what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with consternation . " Well , you know , the same as what everyone else uses . " I realized that I was n't as up on the contraceptive folkways of Vermont as I should have been . " What 's that  --  condoms or a diaphragmor what ? " She looked at me blankly . " I thought you did n't use none of that stuff when you 're trying to have a family ? " " No , but I thought you were trying not to ? " " I said I come in here because the sign said ' Family Planning Center . ' I been trying to have a family for four years now and nothing happens . " I looked at her , horrified . " You mean you want to get pregnant ? " " Thank you all the same , ma'am , " she whispered , sidling toward the door and bolting out . Our second client had been handled by Eddie with somewhat more finesse . She was a high school girl , premaritally pregnant . Thep297father of the child was desperate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with him . Eddie made arrangements with a doctor in Montreal and lent her some dividend money . She wrote Eddie the next week saying that the operation had gone well , that she had gotten a work permit and found a waitressing job , that she intended to stay in Montreal , and she was very happy and very grateful . Soon afterwards , Ira came storming into the clinic , his nostrils flaring and his forehead glistening with sweat . With him was a short stout man in green work clothes who slammed the glass door with a shuddering crash . I looked up from a pamphlet on breast self-examination , which had just convinced me that I was dying of breast cancer . Recognizing Ira , I smiled . After all , we were fellow volunteers to the cause of alleviating human suffering , never mind if that suffering was selfinflictedin the case of the blood drawing for troops in Vietnam . " May I help you ? " " Yes , you can ! " Ira 's fat friend growled . " Get the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ! " I stared at him . " I beg your pardon ? " " I was going to marry that girl ! " he informed me , his voice quivering . " What girl ? " " That girl you and your lesbo friends sent up to Montreal to be butchered ! " " Maybe she did n't want to marry you . " " Of course she did n't , " he growled . " That 's why I knocked her up " I looked first at Ira and then at his friend in wonderment . " You did it on purpose ? " " How else could I get her to marry me ? " " Do you know what it 's like to be pregnant if you do n't want to be ? " I asked , implying that I did . " Shut up , cunt ! " he shouted , and stormed over to my desk , Ira lingering by the door . " Bunch of goddam Commies ! Comin in here tryin to bust up The Home and The Family ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gaining gumption . " What about what she wanted ? Do n't you care about that ? Maybe she did n't want a home and a family . " " What she wanted was to get knocked up and have to have a home and a family . You women are all the same ! That 's what you all want ! "  | " Garbage ! " I screamed , leaping to my feet . " Bullshit ! You men  --  " The man reached out his stubby hands and wrapped a bumper sticker around my mouth , ending my stream of antimale invective . " And you want it , too , baby . Do n't kid yourself , " he informed me as he stomped out . Ira looked at me apologetically and said by way of explanation , " Rodney is a broken man . He loved that little girl . " He left , climbing into a beige Bronco outside . Rodney sat inside , doubled over , sobbing . Ira threw the Bronco into gear and roared off . A sticker on its rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home that afternoon I passed the beige Bronco parked at the back side of the hills that bordered our beaver pond . On its roof was tied a huge black bear corpse . Blood dribbled down the back of the Bronco and onto the " Abortion Is Murder " sticker . To each of the front fenders was lashed a small bear cub . I stopped the truck and gazed in horror , my stomach churning with nausea . Eventually I walked to the edge of the road and looked into the woods . I saw a faint path leading up through our land . I squatted down and let the air out of each tire . For good measure , I grabbed the radio antenna and snapped it off . The war was on . The next time I saw Ira he was a distant duck-shooting silhouette . Earlier that week Atheliah had been slogging around in hip boots in the marsh on the far side of the pond looking for holes in the barbed-wire fence . We had half a dozen heifers by this time , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dazed bovine confusion , on the road to town . We 'd have to drive down and herd them home . Atheliah , as reliable and relentless as a St. Bernard in an avalanche , tracked down and repaired the holes . But at the same time , she discovered a sagging gray duck blind . We 'd never seen it before because it was largely camouflaged by the gray skeletons of drowned trees . Even after Atheliah pointed it out from the cabin , we could just barely pick it out when the light was right . Other times it blended right into the graveyard of standing tree trunks . " Just left over from other years , " Eddie informed us confidently . " No one would dare to use it now that we 're here . " Eddie 's method of expression  --  her deep voice and authoritative inflections , the way she stood with her legs planted like the pilings of a pier and with herp299arms folded serenely across her chest  --  gave her opinions the force of decrees . That was why I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duck season by rifle blasts . I lay still trying to remember where I was . Gunshots were n't an unfamiliar sound to me . The Cloyds were forever killing something or other . Each Cloyd had his favorite rifle , and gun racks hung in their house with the frequency of crucifixes in a Catholic church . They were always dragging in bloodied carcasses as special treats for our family . Mother had tried to instill in me forbearance of the folkway : " Country people are just like that . " And she had exclaimed over the gory corpses like a mother over a small child 's first finger painting . Somehowshe usually managed to render them edible as well . RememberingMother and her compulsive kindness sent pangs of remorse through me : I had n't written or phoned in almost a year ; I had thrown her letters unread into the trash in Cambridge ; I had departed without leaving a forwarding address , so that her current letters were being returned stamped " Addressee Unknown . " She deserved better . Having finally recognized the rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged myself out of bed and across the cold plank floor to the window . There were more shots , and a flock of ducks lifted off the pond in a flurry of feathers . A couple fell lifeless into the water . By straining my eyes in the gray dawn , I could barely pick out two human figures ( one of them Ira , as it turned out ) peering over the edge of the blind . Then I saw Eddie marching down the meadow , her braid flicking and lashing behind her like the tail of an enraged lion . Atheliah , Mona , and Laverne , dressed identically in lumberjack shirts and fatigues and boots , trailed in Eddie 's outraged wake like dinghies behind an ocean liner . Atheliah , of course , could never be said to " trail " anywhere . She barreled along like a diesel truck on a down grade , carrying her ax . Laverne came next , stalking lithely through the timothy . If Laverne had fallen from the roof yesterday when she and Atheliah had been up there caulking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and land lightly on all fours . Whereas Atheliah would have crashed to the ground and left a crater like a giant meteorite . Atheliah was round-shouldered from years of playing down what she considered merely two absurd mounds of woefully misplaced flesh . But Laverne led with her chest at all times . Bringing up the rear was Mona . If Laverne exuded an aura ofp300invitation , Mona exuded one of confrontation . Behind her purpletintedgoggle lenses , her wide eyes periodically became squinty and sinister . She looked like the Gestapo interrogator in spy movies who had lines like , " Ve haff vays off makingk you talk . " Eddie halted abruptly at the pond edge , the others almost collidingwith her . She nodded at the dark green rowboat . Atheliah turned it upright with a flick of her wrist and pushed it into the water with her foot . Eddie climbed in , her weight immediately grounding it . The other three finally freed it by pushing in unison and tripping and splashing in the cold slimy water . Then they hopped in too . Atheliah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oars moving in great swooping strokes like the wings of a giant bird . The heads in the blind stared as the boat slipped through the dead gray trees like a skier down a slalom course . Eddie , in a grand gesture , stood on the front seat and placed a rubber-booted foot on the prow , like Washington crossing the Delaware . The little rowboat , sunk already to its gunwales , listed dangerously . I gritted my teeth . Just in time , they arrived at the blind , and Eddie grabbed hold and righted the tilting craft . She yelled up in her most authoritative voice . The heads yelled back . Atheliah reached over and shook the post nearest her like a puppy shaking a rag in its teeth . The blind trembled and swayed as though it were made of weathered toothpicks . The heads yelled down at her . Eddie turned around and said something to Atheliah . Atheliah lowered an oar , blade first , into the water . Then , holding onto the blind , she climbed into the knee-deep water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax . Reverently , Atheliah removed its leather case . Then , taking the handle in both hands , she raised it above her head . The honed blade flashed red in the rising sun . With one powerful swing , she buried it in the post . The little boat quaked and pitched in the tidal wave produced by the lurching of the blind . Atheliah pulled the ax loose and , just as she was poised for another stroke , the two men scrambled down with their rifles into their inflatablecanvas boat . They rowed quickly to shore and disappeared into the woods , carrying the boat . Atheliah 's second stroke severed the leg , and the blind listed sharply . She chopped through two of the remaining legs , until the last one snapped of its own accord . The entire structure toppled into the pond with a splash . Later that day Eddie had us all out stepping off the borders of ourp301property and planting every fifty feet shiny silver signs that read " No hunting , trapping , fishing or snowmobiling . " Laverne paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark the spot for each post . Eddie and I were nailing signs onto the posts . Mona , in a flurry of chips , was shaping branches into posts . Atheliah , rising to her full six feet with the post maul outstretched over her head , drove the posts with resounding thuds . During a rest period , I said to Eddie with tentative disapproval , " After all , this has been their hunting ground for generations . And besides , I thought you did n't like the idea of private ownership . I thought you believed that the wealth should be shared ? " Eddie , startled to be questioned , replied , " Communal ownership only works if the people involved are highly evolved types . Most Stark 's Boggers need rehabilitation before they 'd be suited for it . In the meantime , they need guidelines to restrain their savagery . It 's not their fault , however : They 've been raised in a corrupt , death-dealing society . How could they turn out any other way ? " " ' Highly evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? " I asked , amazed at my daring . As usual , my loyalties were torn . I had spent too much time with Clem to feel free to pass judgmentwith confidence about the level of evolution attained by the different social groups . Eddie glared at me . " ' Highly evolved ' : attuned to The Revolution . This macho shit  --  stalking and killing and terrorizing  --  is about as low as you can go , evolutionarily . " By the end of the day , we had placed eighty-three signs around the hills that formed the circumference of our property . We returned to the cabin and were standing with our backs to the stove in our mud-caked boots with our callused chapped hands behind our backs . Eddie said , " Well , that 's that ! " Unfortunately , that was n't that . The following week Eddie and I were in the woods checking on the heifers . The colorful fall leaf display had withered and fallen , and crunched under our boots . We had found the six black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was missing . Minnie had dried up , leaving us milkless . I had forgotten that we had to have her bred , and let her have a calf , in order to continue to get milk . The Planned Parenthood literature had not reviewed this aspect of female sexuality . We searched the woods for her . Normally she would come to find us if she heard us . But this time she did n't appear.  |p302I  was peering nervously into a cave that looked as though it might house bears when I heard Eddie exclaim , " Oh Christ ! " I ran over and saw with horror the target of her blasphemy : A bloodied brown cowhide hung wrapped like a robe around one of our No Trespassing posts . Rammed down on top of the post was Minnie 's head , eyes closed . Beside the post on the carpet of vivid leaves were strewn severed cow legs and ropelike guts and globs of white quiveringfat . " The bastards butchered Minnie ! " Eddie screamed . I felt distinctlysick and turned away from the gory mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two trail bikes in a patch of loam . Gingerly folding Minnie 's hide and carrying it between us , we walked back to the cabin , stunned . Buck season opened the next week . We were eating our dessert of soy date bars by the window that overlooked the pond . The sun had set behind the hill . It was twilight . As we watched , a buck and two does leapt out from the woods , paused and listened and sniffed , and then walked grandly to the pond edge . As they reached out their heads to drink , a rifle fired . The handsome buck shook his magnificent antlers ferociously a couple of times . As his head drooped , the two does looked around frantically . They sprang away from the pond , then stopped and looked back quizzically at the buck , who had sunk to his knees in the shallow water . As the does bounded into the woods , the buck collapsed on his side . We five sat with our dessert suspended midway to our mouths . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door . Once outside , Eddie screamed in the general direction of the woods , " Goddam fucking murderers ! " We stumbled through the tangled timothy . By the time we reached the shore , the water on which the large tan buck floated was murky with blood . The buck was n't dead . When he heard us , he gave a snort and a few weak token tosses of his headpiece  --  which had nine points on it , a huntsman 's trophy indeed . This gesture of protest apparently drained him of his last reserves of strength . As we watched , his eyes clouded over ; he twitched , sending out ripples , and then he lay still . " Damn you ! " we screamed to the darkening woods , tears gushing . We each grabbed a leg , and with much grunting and straining ,  |p303managed  to drag the carcass out of the water and onto a patch of timothy . We studied the neat hole in the buck 's muscled white chest . That accomplished , we did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that protein ; on the other hand , we could n't have eaten it , and we were damned if we 'd let the trespassing hunters have it . By now the sky was black . The only light anywhere around was the weak glow of a lamp in our kitchen at the top of the meadow . Eventually we left the buck where he was . The next morning he was gone . The snows began , and late one blustery night we were awakened by a deafening roar from outside . Eddie and I lay still under the army surplus sleeping bag we used as a quilt , listening in terror as the roar circled and recircled our cabin . Finally we got up and walked fearfully to the window . Looking out through the mis-stitches in my crocheted rainbow curtains , we witnessed half a dozen snow machines shooting past , their headlights sweeping eerily across the new snow on the meadow . Relieved and enraged , Eddie stomped out of the bedroom and over to the door . Atheliah was already standing there in rubber boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air force parka . She was holding her ax and was placidly flicking her callused thumb on the blade . Laverne and Mona were nowhere in sight . Eddie and I put on our boots and parkas over our sweat suits ; and the three of us marched onto the porch . The six snow machines swept past us and continued their circuitaround the cabin like marauding Indians around a wagon train , envelopingus in clouds of exhaust . At the controls of each machine knelta figure of indeterminate sex , encased in a quilted body suit and feltedrubber boots and a huge crash helmet with a visor like on a knight'shelmet . I was certain that I detected Ira 's flaring nostrils behind oneof the visors , and the fat face of his friend Rodney behind another . Eddie yelled in a great booming voice that was inaudible in theroaring of the engines , " Get the hell out of here , or I 'll call the cops ! " There were no cops in Stark 's Bog , but the expression on her faceseemed to make up for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more spin around the cabin , the machines broke away oneby one and filed down the meadow toward the pond . In the meadow , they paused long enough to weave some intricate crisscrossing patternsthrough the snow , their headlights sweeping crazily acrossp304the field . And then they disappeared over the hill toward town . The next morning Eddie marched us out to the meadow . We scraped a patch of ground clear of its shallow snow . The ground had n't yet frozen , and so we were able to dig a deep hole , working in shifts with two shovels . By the end of the afternoon , the hole was the size of a hefty grave , five feet deep and maybe six feet in diameter . Eddie disappeared into the barn and returned with a dozen stakes with sharp points that looked like the poles the Cloyds used for curing tobacco . When I finally got the picture of what we were doing  --  setting a trap based on Vietcong guerrilla techniques  --  I balked . " Wait a minute , Eddie . We just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't ? " Eddie asked , looking around for support . Laverne shrugged . Mona said gleefully , " I 'd just as soon hurt them while we 're at it . " Atheliah nodded soberly in agreement . " I do n't want any part of it , " I announced , turning around and heading for the cabin . My stand was n't entirely disinterested . I sus- , pected that Ira and his friend Rodney had been among the snowmobilers . Although I hated their macho guts , I did n't want to see them spilled all across our meadow either . The old spike-in-the-pit routine required that your victim be a faceless abstraction . Alas , Ira and Rodney were becoming real people to me . I peeked out the window through my rainbow curtains as the others sunk the sharp stakes in the pit . Then they laid fir branches across its mouth , and piled snow on the branches . When they had finished packing the snow , the location of the pit was still evident to someone who knew of its existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be invisible . Later that week after a heavy snow the snowmobiles returned in in the middle of the night . Once again we were wrenched from sleep by their roaring . The five of us jumped from our beds and flocked to the window overlooking the meadow . As before , after a couple of dozen circuits of our cabin , the snowmobilers broke away one by one and swept down the meadow . The first three machines were nowhere near the pit . Each time one reached the bottom without mishap , the others groaned with disappointment . But the driver of the fourth machine was a showoff . He zigzagged down the top part of the meadow , wagging the tail of his machine like a wedeln skier . His fall line passed directly over the pit , but whetherp305or not his swooping antics would cause him to miss it was uncertain . I held my breath , suppressing an inclination to rush out and stop him . He fishtailed whimsically along , kneeling on his seat and leaning back and forth with the careening machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was sure that he had passed the pit , the ground fell out from under him and his machine was swallowed up . Eddie whooped with delight . The driver himself sailed clear of the machine . He lay half buried in the snow , dazed . Flames suddenly flared out from the pit . Mona said uneasily , " Jesus . " We all watched in terrified awe as flames roared and melted the snow on all sides . The driver was rolling fast down the hill . " Now what ? " I asked Eddie , our field marshal , as I trembled with fear . " We go out and help , ' " Eddie said with an insane giggle . Throwing on parkas and ski boots , we trooped from the cabin and strapped on our cross-country skis . We glided down the meadow along the packed snowmobile tracks . By now , the fire had burned down . The other snowmobiles were flocked close by , and their drivers were standing looking into the fading inferno and shaking their helmetedheads . The fire had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches . Only the blackened gutted carcass of a Sno Cat remained . " Goodness me , what happened ? " Eddie inquired . " I du n no , " one driver mumbled . " Jesum Crow , did n't see the goldurn hole . " " Can we help ? " Mona asked . " Do n't suppose none of us can now , " another driver replied dourly . The driver of the burnt-out machine was still lying in the snow down the hill . A couple of his friends were with him . Eddie and I strolled over . " Are you okay ? " she asked gravely . The unhappy victim had his helmet off . It was Rodney , his round mean face shaken . Squatting next to him was Ira , his visor raised to display his ruddy high-boned cheeks and his quivering nostrils . He and I smiled slightly in recognition . " I 'm all right , " Rodney snarled , " but you 're gon na have to pay forp306my machine . " I immediately assumed that we had been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , we would n't think of it ! " " You had no goldurn warning signs up , so you 'll have to replace my machine ! " " That beats anything I 've ever heard ! You trespass on our posted property . You harass us in the middle of the night in our private home by circling around on those  --  lawn mowers . And now you ask us to buy you another one when you 're dumb enough to fall in a hole ! " " Jesum Crow , lady ! " Rodney yelled . " We 've driven our machines on this field and this pond for years ! It 's the best race track in the county . You ca n't post it just like that ! " " The hell we ca n't ! " Eddie turned around on her skis . Ira and I looked at each other and shrugged . Eddie and I began herringboning back up the meadow , hunched over and pushing with our poles and looking altogether like arthritic flamingos . " See you in court ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest . We five were spending quite a bit of time in the cabin . The atmosphere was tense . We were waiting to see what would happen next in our sheepmen/cattlemen feud with the Stark 's Boggers , whom we had intended to befriend and instruct in the ways of The Revolution . For another thing , we had run out of things to say to each other . After several weeks of sitting around the stove in the evenings , we had completely exhausted the possibilitiesfor conversation contained in each of our autobiographies . We had heard a limb by limb description of the dismemberment of the fetus in Mona 's womb by suction aspiration . Eddie had spoken haltingly , but at great length , about her mother , who turned out to be a prostitute and who had brought her clients home for her couplings . Atheliah told about being called Goliath behind her back in secondary school . She had begun slouching and hunching in order to minimize her size , her spine becoming increasingly bowed under the weight of derision from diminutive pubescent males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , they began imitating her hunch when she was n't looking , stooping over and swaying their arms with their hands brushing their kneecaps . They began calling her Atheliah the Ape . Once we had all established that nothing about us was our own fault , that we were all victims of the exploitative patriarchal society we were now dedicated to overthrowing , that we were in the process ofp307breaking free from the social constraints that had been imprisoning us , and that we were well on our way toward realizing our full goodnessand virtue  --  what was there left to say ? So we took up hobbies . One dark snowy afternoon Laverne had shut herself into her room with her vibrator . Squeals of ecstasy were filling the cabin . The electric lights in the kitchen where Eddie and I sat were dimming and brightening rhythmically , like the lights on death row during an electrocution . Our electric bill had jumped five percent since Laverne had moved in . I was sitting next to the wood stove crocheting the green section of my ninth rainbow curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddie had installed a foot-powered potter 's wheel in the kitchen corner and was directing her considerable sculpting talents into more immediately relevant channels by making dishes . That afternoon she was working on soup bowls . Snow was lashing against the windows , and the fire felt good . Mona and Atheliah were in the living room practicing their Tae Kwon Do , which they were learning via a correspondence course from Boston . Grunts and jarring crashes blended with the gasps and shrieks from Laverne 's bedroom to make the cabin sound like a medievaltorture chamber . " What did you and Laverne do all day alone here together when the rest of us used to go up to the woodlot ? " Eddie inquired casually , wetting her fingers in a dish of water and pedaling the wheel with her foot . " Oh , nothing much . I did the usual stuff  --  cooking and cleaning . And Laverne just wandered around trying to figure out what she should be doing . " " I bet . " I let my hands and my crocheting fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did she use it on you ? " she asked , not meeting my eyes . " Use what on me ? What are you talking about ? " " That appliance of hers . That plastic phallus . " " What  --  the vibrator ? I 've never even seen it . Look , now what 's bugging you , Eddie ? " " Oh , I know you wish you were up there with her right now . Do n't think I do n't notice the way you look at each other . " She smoothed the clay with her fingers . " Eddie , no . You 're on the wrong track , sweetheart . If I wanted another lover , it certainly would n't be a wo  --  " It was too late.  | " A woman ? " Eddie crowed . " I knew it : You 're going straight ! Who do you go to down in Stark 's Bog , Ginny ? Which one of the village studs is putting it to you ? There 's no use pretending it does n't happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinic when you were supposed to be on duty and were n't there . " I blushed and looked away guiltily . She had indeed found me out . I had been unfaithful to her a number of times over the past month or so . On my days at our center , I 'd dutifully make myself a sandwich for lunch  --  soy-olive spread on dense whole wheat bread . But not only had I come to loathe the sight of a soybean , our jars of unsprayed grains and seeds had turned into terrariums , insects of every type hatching and flourishing in them . Consequently , at lunchtime , I 'd taken to sneaking over to the IGA . I 'd buy a can of Franco-American Spaghetti-O 's and wolf it down out back by the garbage cans , one of which would be blessed with the deposit of my untouched soy-olive sandwich . I remained silent , unable to confess this to Eddie . " Do n't think I did n't notice the sly smile you gave that creep whose friend wracked up his snow machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up my crocheting and jerked its strands straight with a gesture of disgust . " I 've seen him around town , " I replied with dignity . " I was just being pleasant . " " Oh sure . How does it feel to have the real thing , Ginny , after all these months of makeshift sex with me ? " " That settles it , " I said calmly , dropping my crocheting into my lap . " I 've had it . I 'm leaving . " " Oh no you are n't , " Eddie informed me . I looked at her . " I 'm leaving . " She stood up . " I 'm leaving , " I insisted , standing up . " I thought of it first . " I began to stalk from the room . I felt a sharp pain on the side of my head and heard something hit the floor and shatter beside me . I felt dizzy and propped myself against the doorjamb . " God damn you , Ginny ! " Eddie yelled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when I 'm talking to you , you fucking bitch ! " I put my fingers to my forehead and brought them down covered with blood . In a moment , Eddie was standing next to me in the shattered earthenware , dabbing ineffectually at my forehead and sobbing ,  | " Christ ! I 've killed her ! Oh God ! What have I done ? Ginny , you 're bleeding ! " The cut turned out to be minor , though the bruise would be more major , to my satisfaction . Later , after it was cleaned up , I said , " Eddie , something scary is happening to you . You 've got to get a grip on yourself . This jealousy number just does n't make sense . " " Maybe it does n't make sense , " she said sullenly , slumped over her wheel , " but I feel that it 's valid . It 's you something is happening to , not me . And what 's happening is that you 're going straight . I know it as clearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said calmly , fearful of another outburst , " You 've always insisted , Eddie , that two opposite points of view on something could be argued equally convincingly in rational terms by merely switching the underlying assumptions . You said that to find out the truth about a situation , I had to rely on what I felt about it . Well , you feel I 'm losing interest . But I feel I 'm not . Which of us is right , Eddie ? " " I 'm right because I know I 'm right . " " And I know I 'm right . So where does that leave us ? " Eddie brooded , while I crocheted . That night at supper she asked , " At what point do people cease to be roommates and begin to be a commune ? " We all shrugged indifferently , me holding an ice pack to my swollen eye . " This set-up is getting to be , like , incestuous , " Eddie continued . " It does n't feel good to me anymore . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mona shook her head in emphatic agreement . " You 're right , Eddie . It 's a totally insular existence . " " It had to be , " I insisted . " We had to get everything going around here . But lately we 've been getting involved  --  with the clinic and all . " " That is n't the kind of involvement I mean , " Eddie said scornfully . " That 's small-time stuff . I 've been thinking about this all afternoon . See what you think of it : a Third World Women 's Commune here at the Free Farm ! We buy the land , and we get groups of women from the cities  --  black women , Puerto Ricans , American Indians  --  to build houses all over . Not randomly , but planned so that everyone would have both privacy and community . Then we build a community center with potter 's wheels and woodworking equipment , all kinds of craft supplies . And a day care area ! We work the land together andp310become financially self-sustaining with cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . Facilities for radical groups from the cities to come up with their families for vacations in the country . We prove right here in Stark 's Bog , Vermont , that it 's possible for women of different races and classes to live together in peace and loving cooperation . We establish once and for all that when life is otherwise , it 's only because people have been so fucked over by the macho ruling class ! " I prodded my bruised eye , wondering how we were to get along with unknown blacks and Puerto Ricans when we could n't even get along with each other more than intermittently . But Eddie 's words had kindled a fire in the others . By the time she had finished , the hills around us were dotted with owner-built homes ; the fields were full of bare-breasted sisters of all colors , sweating shoulder to shoulder . A community center sat by the beaver pond and was packed with talented craftswomen who were cheerfully casting and molding and weaving all the material goods needed by the entire group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eddie , " I asked hesitantly , afraid of sounding bougie , " where are we going to get the $60,000 to buy the land ? " " You and your fucking accountant mentality ! " Eddie said grandly , waving the question aside . " I have an idea ! " Atheliah said with an inspired smile , her frizzy red hair waving around her head like a mad inventor 's . " We have , like , a women 's festival . A weekend thing with workshops and stuff . The Free Farm Women 's Weekend ! I can spread the word through friends in Newark and New York . That way we can get women here , they can see the place , we can see them , and maybe some will join us ! " " In other words , we need reinforcements against the Stark 's Boggers ? " I asked sourly . I was ignored . An accountant mentality had no place in The Revolution . God only knows how we fitted eighty women into our cabin . The first night their sleeping-bagged bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefield . They came from the surrounding towns and woods of Vermont . They also came , women of all sizes and shapes , from Montreal and Boston , from New York and Philadelphia . The grapevine approach had worked . The men in Mona 's and Atheliah 's former house had agreed to babysit as their contribution to the cause of female freedom and were now saddled ,  |p311in  their moss-lined living room , with twenty-eight frightened and unhappy children in various phases of toilet training . The next morning , after the frantic line-up in front of our one toilet , and after volunteers had cleared away the remains of some 148 pieces of whole wheat toast and half that many styrofoam cups of rose hip tea , we divided into groups and went into different rooms for our seminars . My job was to supervise volunteers in assembling a lunch out of the food everyone had donated . I had some free time , so I wandered quietly from room to room . Eddie 's group , called " Women and Politics , " went on a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the manure-filled barn , the eggs we had neglected to collect , the unpruned orchard . Eddie considered her workshop the equivalent of a model home showing in a suburban development . She was out to make converts to the simple life , which ours was , to hear her tell it . But she had a devil 's advocate  --  a tall , attractive , intelligent woman who kept making uncomfortable remarks like , " What you doin up here in the woods , man ? The world 's crashin down around your heads , and you 're playin at being peasants ! You 're on a fuckin earth trip , man ! " Huffily , Eddie replied , " Like , it 's not enough to say that you 're against war , or you 're against the society that 's fighting it . What are you for , man ? It 's not enough to be antideath , you got to be prolife . You ca n't criticize a society and expect to enjoy its fruits at the same time , man . You have to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe certain things , you have to live them as well . " " I am living my beliefs , " the woman protested , glancing with distaste at the piles of manure . " And not in Outer East Judas , Vermont , where no one cares . I teach at Boston University . I 'm changing society directly by my influence on the heads of my students , the future leaders of this oppressive society . There 's no more radical trip a person can get into than teaching . You 're the one that 's copping out  --  stuck away in some snowbound corner of the nation playing with yourselfl " Eddie and the woman were locked in a match of **25;2765;TOOLONG , both having adopted more-radical-than-thou tones ofvoice . This might go on all weekend , I speculated as I turned to leave . " Garbage ! " Eddie snorted . " You 're ensconced there in that templeof learning where every student in sight already agrees with everyp312word you utter . They come from the exact same background as you , they think the same thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip is to voluntarily place yourself among The People , who may scorn everything about you . To win them over to The Revolution is an achievement . Well , we 're working shoulder to shoulder with people like that every day . Making inroads into their heads , winning over their hearts by stealth . " I turned around and shot Eddie a questioning look . Could she possibly be speaking of us  --  the Commie outcasts of Stark 's Bog , who were engaged in weekly skirmishes with The People over our continuedcorporeal existence ? I headed back through the snow toward the cabin . Laverne 's group , " Women and Their Bodies , " in Eddie 's and my first-floor bedroom , was in a fascinated cluster around Laverne herself . She sat in a chair , her knees drawn up to her shoulders like chicken wings . With the aid of a complex arrangement of an inserted plastic speculum , mirrors , and a flashlight , Laverne was demonstrating to the intrigued gathering how it was possible , if one possessed the flexibility of an Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mouth of one 's cervix . I stood transfixed , gazing at the moist red hole . But for the life of me , I could n't grasp why anyone would want to view the mouth of her cervix as reflected in a mirror . I felt I could n't ask Laverne at the risk of sounding bougie . I kept going . In the living room was Mona 's group , the " Women and Rage " set . A woman in a Sisterhood Is Powerful T-shirt was lying on the floor . Tears were gushing from her closed eyes and down her cheeks . She was shaking with sobs . Mona and her group were lined up on either side of her , slowly massaging the entire length and breadth of her shuddering body . " It 's cool , " Mona was saying quietly , kneeding a thigh . " We 're all sisters . Most of us have been in the same space . Go ahead . Lay it on us . " Well , " she gasped , between sobs , " so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , like , you know , happy or something . " She paused to shake with sobs . Someone stationed near her head leaned over and gently licked the tears from her cheeks . It seemed to calm her , although it was driving me wild with revulsion . She continued shakily , " . . . so he stood up . I thought he was coming over to kiss me or hold me or something . I smiled at him . I was so proud and pleased . You know what he did ? He slapped me ,  |p313as  hard as he could . It knocked me out of the chair and onto the floor . He started yelling , calling me a whore and a cunt and a bitch , and accusing me of trying to , like , trap him . " She wailed in agony . The group speeded up their massage . Mona crawled around to the top of her head , looked down at her fondly through purple-tinted lenses , and began massaging her temples . " What did you do ? " Mona prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jerk of her head . " I just lay there . I was so stunned . I could n't believe it . I lay there trying to get my head straight . Stunned first that he was n't pleased like I was ; and second that he was calling me a whore , because I had really loved him . He knew I had never had sex with anyone before him . And I especially could n't believe that he had hit me . He 'd always been , like , so kind and so gentle . But the next thing I knew , he was kicking me in the stomach . He was wearing combat boots , and he just kept kicking me , hard . He kept yelling that he was n't going to let himself be tied down by some two-bit whore . And he kept kicking me in the stomach , so that I could n't get my breath . " She started gasping for breath . One of the group began pumping her chest to help her breathe . Everyone 's face was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mona asked , looking more and more vindictive . " When I was seven months pregnant , he walked out and never came back . It was six in the morning , I remember . I was on my knees scrubbing the kitchen linoleum . He was a real cleanliness freak . I did n't care that much about gleaming linoleum . I was doing it for him , before I left for work . He was n't working regularly at the time . Some nights he played with a band . I was supporting both of us . Anyhow , that morning I was kneeling over the scrub bucket , surrounded by a floorful of dirty water , and I started crying . I was just so tired , with working all day and being seven months pregnant and getting up early to scrub the floor and iron his shirts . Tears were dripping off my face and into the sudsy water . About that time , he stomped in . He 'd been out all night , possibly with another woman . He stared at me with disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a mess  --  dirt all over you and your hair in tangles . Is it any wonder I stay away from you as much as I can ? ' And he threw his stuff in a duffel bag and left . I have n't seen him since . " " Go on . Get angry , " Mona whispered . " Give in to it . " The woman 's expression changed abruptly from luxurious self/pity to fury . " The bastard ! " she screamed . " The goddam motherfuckingson of a bitch ! Jesus , I hate that lousy cock-sucking Spic ! " The group rolled her over on her stomach . She began pounding the floor with her fists in a rhythmic tattoo of rage . " And what would you like to do to him ? " Mona whispered . " I 'd like to take a huge sharp carving knife and  --  " I walked fast into the kitchen so that I would n't have to hear what she was going to do with her knife . Much as I sympathized with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy with a woman I 'd never seen before and would most likely never see again . A quickie of the emotions . Atheliah was somewhere in the cabin , conducting a session on " Women and Work . " I knew that housework and child-rearing were being roundly dumped on , and that I would feel agonizingly bougie once I felt compelled to mention what a trip I found cleaning the shower to be ; how I would remove all my clothes and climb in with a sponge and Comet and really get into it . I sat down and tried not to listen to the poundings and shrieking from the " Women and Rage " workshop , where the woman was in the process of hacking her ex-lover to bits . I was feeling estranged from my sisters , and forlorn about feeling estranged . And I was a little bit scared because I knew that if I sat in on the " Women and Rage " workshop for a few minutes , having lowered this sense of estrangementthat I used as a defense , I 'd be beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came recreation . Some women went sledding and skiing and snowshoeing on the meadow . Several built a great toweringfemale torso from snow outside the living room window . Others sat around smoking dope and drinking Annie Green Springs Country Cherry Wine . A couple were playing guitars and singing . After dinner Bev Butch and the Four Femmes , a women 's rock band from Boston who had come for the weekend , set up their instruments and speakers in the living room . They played loud songs from the early sixties , and we all boogied , either as couples or singly . It was like being at a junior high sock hop before any of the boys had gotten up the courage or coordination to dance . As the evening progressed , the living room became hot and stuffy from all the exercising bodies , in spite of subzero temperatures outside . Every dancer 's face was dripping with sweat , and each Anglo/Afro hairdo was becoming even frizzier . Country Cherry Wine was being guzzled like lemonade on a summer afternoon . Finally Laverne in a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was  --  her magnificent chest , glistening with sweat . A dozen or more women followed suit , until the entire living room seemed filled with bare breasts swaying and jouncing to the driving beat . I was lying with Eddie against someone 's rolled up sleeping bag . We were holding hands and were passing a joint . " Well , I think it 's a success , do n't you ? " I asked . " I guess so , " she agreed . " But I think most of them are just here for a good time . " " That 's okay , is n't it ? " I was forgetting Eddie 's vision of a multihuedphalanx of women working the land shoulder to shoulder . " Sure , if you 're running a fucking resort . Besides , there 's only one black woman here . No Puerto Ricans , no Indians . How can we have a Third World Collective with no Third World women ? " " I 'm part Cherokee Indian , " I offered . She turned on me with astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never told me ? Are you ashamed of it or what ? " " To tell you the truth , I never think about it . Does that make me an Uncle Tom-tom ? " I collapsed with laughter at my little joke . " Repression , " she said darkly . " You 're repressing your heritage . Society has made you ashamed of your birthright . You think Indians are second-class citizens . " " I do n't think so , " I said , ever vigilant for my manifestations of bourgeois prejudice . " It just never seemed that significant . My **31;2792;TOOLONG a Cherokee squaw . That makes me one thirty-second part Cherokee Indian . Up against all that Anglo-Saxonry . Big deal . " " Big deal ? That happens to be the missing link in your character ! I could never figure out why you were n't altogether impossible with that mansion of yours , and those fascist parents . But you 've got soul after all , Ginny . " She rolled over and kissed me passionately . I was pleased that my genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather was a coal miner , " I offered , wanting to make her another gift . " Lots of my cousins still are . In the Appala-chians . " " You 're kidding ? " Eddie said , beaming . " Far out . Jesus , Ginny , you 've been holding out on me ! Let 's dance . I want to hold you . "  |p316Bev  Butch was singing a slow song , " Longer Than Always Is a Long Long Time . " Eddie and I wrapped our arms around each other and swayed in place , burying our mouths in each other 's neck . Around the room many other couples were embracing in time to the music  --  in several cases one or both partners were shirtless , and much caressing of breasts was going on . Marijuana smoke hung over the room like industrial smog over Hullsport . Most of the lights were out . Those that were still on were flickering rhythmically to Laverne 's vibrator in an upstairs bedroom . Couples or threesomes were drifting off to the bedrooms . I sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant indeed . This was where I belonged ; at last after much searching I had found my niche  --  it was here in Eddie Holzer 's arms . The door flew open and crashed against the wall . Snow swept in . A dozen huge figures in felt boots and dark quilted jumpsuits and visored helmets tramped in . They looked like astronauts on a moon mission , only more sinister and not so clean-cut . The band stopped abruptly . The dancing couples looked up and pulled apart . The snowmobilers lined up across one end of the room . Their tiny eyes , almost lost in the dark caverns of their helmets , gleamed with lust . They began moving forward as a line , clomping one booted foot slowly in front of the other . Mindless panic gripped me as they herded us together like sheep for the slaughter . A figure on an outside edge reached out and grabbed the wrist of a bare-breasted woman in low-slung blue jeans who was cowering by the wall . She tried to scratch at his eyes , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bite his hand , but got a mouthful of padded leather . She screamed and struggledas he started dragging her to the door . Several women moved to help her , but became immediately aware that they had pressing problems of their own as the line of dark figures closed in . Apparently what they had in mind was a Sabine women scene . Each would grab one of us and throw her across his snow machine and disappear into the night . I saw no reason why they should n't do this , as long as they left me out of it . Eddie moved away from me and stood directly in their path with her hands resting on her hips . A figure in the line was moving toward me . I could n't see through his visor very well ; what little light there was was reflecting off the plastic rather than penetrating it . But I couldp317have sworn I recognized Ira 's alarmed eyes and his flaring nostrils and his full quivering lips . His expression was n't malicious , though ; it was wistful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gazed at her Romeo among his enemy kinsmen . " What do you think you 're doing ? " Eddie demanded in a voice that would have caused flowers to wilt in the spring . The row halted abruptly , lead feet extended . Atheliah sauntered up to Eddie 's side . She was casually removing the leather case from her ax . She flicked its blade with her thumb and looked serenely at the snowsuited spectersas though they were a row of saplings to be felled . " Get out of our house and off our land , " Eddie ordered , in a tone that indicated that " our " implied at least thirty-seven percent of the American people in a recent Harris poll , and not several dozen terrifiedfemales . The line stood still and mute for a full minute , the confrontation being waged in a dimension not involving , for the moment , words and actions . Finally , the man who had been approaching me , Ira it did turn out to be , raised his visor , knightlike , and said sheepishly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop by . " Eddie looked at him with amazement and said , " Well , you 're not invited , so get your trespassing ass out of here . And take your macho friends with you . " She turned her back on them and signaled to Bev Butch to start playing . Shakily , the band swung into an uncoordinated rendition of " Great Balls of Fire . " The snowmobilers skulked toward the door with sulky backward glances . When they were out on the porch , Eddie stalked over and called after them , enjoying her command , " And do n't come back until you 're invited . Which will be never ! " Glumly , they stepped into the snow . I heard one mumble something about being " pussy whipped . " Two , as they stomped past the towering bluish ice sculpture of the female torso , applied their shouldersto it and brought it crashing to the ground , where it broke into a thousand pieces . The next day as people were leaving , Eddie issued invitations to a carefully selected handful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Third World bit , she replied casually , " Oh , my lover is part Cherokee Indian ; and of course her parents are Appalachian coal miners . "  | " Oh wow ! " said the woman who had challenged her , as impressed as any suburbanite would be to learn that a neighbor was a Worthley graduate . I preened shamelessly . " And of course my father was Puerto Rican , " Eddie added . I looked at her questioningly . " Well , he might have been , " she replied defensively after the woman left . We did n't make any converts that afternoon , but we did feel we 'd planted the seed in several receptive heads . We had also forged sisterly bonds with other area farms , and we had made plans to get together soon for the countercultural equivalent of afternoon bridge or morning coffee  --  some consciousness-raising . After we had tamed the debris in the cabin , Mona , Atheliah , Eddie , and I went skiing . Laverne stayed behind for an assignation with her vibrator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet after the din of the weekend . We skied across meadows and through snowladenpine forests . We peeked into hemlock trees and found deer hideouts  --  branches pinned tentlike to the ground by snow , and the snow within packed by tiny hoofs . Winter birds hopped around in the branches . The weak winter sun ducked and darted behind the clouds and the tall treetops . I was pervaded by a great sense of peace and well-being . " Whew ! It 's nice to have that over with . " The others gave me looks of reprimand to indicate that I was n't displaying the appropriate collective feeling . " Well , it was kind of crowded and noisy , do n't you think ? And the mess of all those bodies trying to eat and sleep and shit at once ! " " Those ' bodies ' were our sisters , " Mona pointed out . " Sisters or not , it 's nice to have them gone , " I insisted with good humor . No one replied . We skied on , our tips clacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun flashing on our faces . If not God , then Someone equally influential was in heaven , and all seemed right with the world  --  which sentiment was a considerable relief after my seizure of unutterableloneliness yesterday morning in the midst of my eighty sisters . We herringboned briskly up a hillside . As we began to descend the opposite side , a deafening boom enveloped the countryside . We looked at each other with concern.  | " A sonic boom , " Eddie said confidently . At that point , we almost ran head-on into a chain-link fence . " What the fuck ? " Eddie grumbled . With annoyance at having our course disrupted , we turned south and skied alongside the high barbed-wire-capped fence . After fifty yards we came to a sign  --  white with red lettering saying , " Keep Out ! Gun Testing Range . " We looked at each other in astonishment . We were in the middle of a woods in an underpopulated area of a rural state . For several miles we had seen no other person , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , and who was there to test them ? We skied on , following the fence , intent upon satisfying our curiosity . Meanwhile , shattering blasts kept rocking the small valley . Abruptly , the fence turned a corner . So did we , following it like Dorothy of Oz on the Yellow Brick Road . Several hundred yards and one right angle later , we found ourselvesat a locked gate on which was a large sign reading " Keep Out . Gun Test Range . General Machine , Inc. , Ludbury , Vermont . " Inside were clutches of men in army fatigues tending large mortar-type guns . " Christ , they 're everywhere , " Eddie whispered . " They wo n't be content until they 've killed us all . " She began trembling . I 'd never seen her frightened of anything . But here she was , clearly having an anxiety attack such as seized all the rest of us on a regular basis . The confrontation with the snowmobilers must have drained her of her weekly allotment of courage . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Atheliah took the other , and between us , we managed to slide her back into the woods , where she regained command enough to yell back toward the firing range , " Goddam butchers ! " However , when we were about halfway back to the cabin , toiling through deeply drifted snow in a broad field , we heard a roar overhead . Stabbing our poles upright in the snow , we clapped our gloved hands over our ears . Three low-flying jets , in perfect formation , came straight at us . They were the flat triangular kind that looked like silver airborne stingrays . Eddie screamed , " Oh Christ ! They 've got me ! " And she threw herself headfirst into a snowdrift , tangling her skis around her in the process . The planes passed by well above us . The three of us dragged Eddie out of her snowbank . She sat quivering in the snow , her face buried in her hands.  | " Are you okay ? " I asked finally , disturbed by this display of weaknessin my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood up , and we pressed on . The next morning everyone left the cabin but me . Eddie and Laverne went down to the clinic . And Atheliah and Mona skied to their old farm to borrow some soybeans . I was sitting in the kitchen , my feet propped on the stove , savoring my solitude like the counterrevolutionary that I was beginning to think I really was : I was sick to death of sharing with the sisters . Suddenly I heard a snowmobile in our meadow . Reluctantly , I plunked my feet to the floor and looked out . Hopping off his Deluxe Sno Cat 44 and pulling off his helmet was Ira . I felt a fleeting pang of pleasure , which I promptly squelched . After all , but for Eddie , he would have carried me off into the night last Saturday . " Yes ? " I inquired coolly , sauntering out onto the porch . Ira wore a quilted snowsuit ; his dark curly hair was a scrambled mess from his helmet , and his smiling white teeth were dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , slipping off his huge black leather glove and offering me his hand . I carefully ignored the hand and asked , " What do you want , Mr. Bliss ? " " Ira , " he said , flashing his smile , his nostrils flaring . " May I come in for a minute ? " He blew on his hands and rubbed them . He was right . It was cold . I was shivering in my turtleneck . " I do n't see the need for that . " " Look , ma'am , I 'm freezing . " " Then do n't roar around on your toy sled at sixty miles per hour . " " All right , look , " he said , raising his arms as though someone had stuck a pistol in his ribs . " I run with a rowdy bunch . Sometimes they do things I do n't care for , and I go along with them because I do n't have the strength of character to stand up to them . But that 's really why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ira had captured my sympathy . I knew what he meant : I ran with rowdy groups , too , and often lacked the gumption to be different when I did n't approve of their activities . I smiled in spite of myself , a faint smile that acknowledged kinship . " All right , Mr. Bliss . Come in and warm up by the stove . " He sat down opposite me and unzipped his jumpsuit to the waist.  |p321He  was wearing his tight red shirt , the one from the Vietnam blood drawing that displayed his impressive musculature . I studied those taut sinewy muscles , trying not to be too obvious about it . His body was so different from a woman 's , with which I had been mostly occupied for almost three years . Eddie 's body was all firm mounds and smooth curves and secret folds . One model probably was n't any better or worse than the other , but they certainly were different . I cleared my throat , trying hard to think of some unprovocative topic for discussion . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously in unison . " I have a second reason for being here , " Ira admitted . " I sell life insurance . No , wait ! Before you tune me out , just listen to what I have to say . Now , I know that you and your friends are pretty independent women . But have you ever thought about what happens if one of you were to die ? That sounds pretty morbid , but it 's a topic we all have to face sometime or other , right ? Okay , so traditionally , people have thought of life insurance as something a man takes out to provide for his wife and children should he die . Well , you do n't have children to look out for , I gather , but you do have a chance to provide for the people closest to you , should something happen to you . There must be someone who could profit from your death , right ? Uh , that 's not exactly what I meant .... " I had n't tuned Ira out . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic had occurred to me , of what would happen to Eddie if I suddenly died , which I was bound to entertain as an ever-present possibility , considering who had reared me . There was no way I could alter my trust fund so that Eddie could have my dividend checks . The fund would revert to the Major , who conceivably had gunmen on my trail for that very reason , since I had n't written home since picketing his factory . What could Eddie do to support herself when I lay six feet under ? Things she would hate , things that would destroy her defiant spirit  --  waitressing , chambermaiding , secretarial work . She was poor , I was rich . It was through no fault of her own , and it was not to my credit . I should share the wealth , should make provisions to continue sharing it once I was gone . Seemingly surprised at not being put down , Ira continued , his Victor Mature forehead gleaming with sweat from the stove heat . " Now , there are two types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Term requires a relatively small premium in return for which your beneficiary receives the face amount of the policy shouldp322you die within the term period . Whole life is more an investment . You pay premiums during your lifetime and should you live to ninetysix , you get the face amount back . Which plan you would choose would depend on your financial circumstances and your insurance goals . Do you mind if I ask what you live on ? " Abruptly I snapped out of my calculations . " Yes , I do . I do n't see that it 's any of your business . " His eyes became wide and alarmed . " I 'm sorry . I was just trying to help . " " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to bark at you . I 'm interested in what you 've been saying , and I 'm not sure how to proceed . " " Well , first of all , who 's living here with you ? " I glared at him suspiciously . " What does that have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the front man for the Stark 's Bog Marauders . " Well , I mean , if you 're thinking of insuring yourself , it helps to know how many people you 're trying to provide for , right ? " Just then our truck roared up the driveway . I glanced around guiltily . I had been talking alone with a man , with a Stark 's Bog snowmobiler  --  and I had been enjoying it . What was Eddie going to say ? " I think you 'd better go . " " Would n't your friends like to hear about insurance possibilities ? " " No , they would n't , " I assured him . " I want it to be a surprise , " I added , to soften the fact that I was kicking him out . I opened the door and shoved him out . He stepped off the porch , zipping his Ski-Doo suit . As he waded through the broken bits of the Women 's Weekend ice sculpture , Eddie came stomping over . She shook a fist at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yelled , " And you can tell your friends to go fuck themselves ! " He turned around , startled . " Look  --  " " Just go , " I said grimly , pushing him toward his machine . As he roared off , Eddie turned on me , trembling with rage . " Sothat 's what goes on here when I leave , you sneaky bitch ! But I caughtyou . " " Nothing ' went on , ' Eddie , I assure you . " " Shit , Ginny ! I may be poor , but I 'm not dumb ! I saw the way youtwo were looking at each other , all guilty and conspiratorial ! Goddamit , I saw him putting his clothes on as he left ! Stop lying to me , whore ! " I decided to fight fire with fire . " Shut up , you maniac ! I saidnothing went on and I meant it ! I do n't lie , Eddie , and least of all top323you . But so what if something were going on ? Where are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't those ideas extend beyond sharing my dividend checks ? What about all the garbage you 're alwaysspouting about mingling with The People ? Does n't that include mingling on terms of warmth and affection ? I 'll tell you what , Eddie , I 've put up with all I 'm going to with this jealousy number . You 're really fucking me over . I swear to God , I 've never been unfaithful to you , but you 're driving me right into Ira Bliss 's bed ! " " Stop threatening me , " she said , shocked to hear me talking back so forcefully . " I 'm not threatening you . I 'm just explaining what 's happening . I 'm outlining for you the dynamics of our relationship so that you wo n't be too surprised when things turn out the way you 're programingthem to . " We stood glaring at each other over the mountains of snow from the tumbled statue . I shivered . " Christ , I 'm freezing , " I mumbled , depleted of emotional energy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as here . " As we sat around the stove with Laverne , Eddie said wearily , " Let me tell you what happened first . We got to the office and found that a window had been smashed and the lock on the door had been sawed off . Wait . There 's more . Inside , red paint was splashed all over the walls and the furniture . The pamphlets had been burned in the metal trash can , and the ashes were dumped all over the floor . And one wall was literally papered with those damn Abortion Is Murder ' stickers . " " Oh God , " I moaned , burying my face in my hands . " Clearly we 've gone about this the wrong way . " " Ur ? What can you expect from a bunch of mentally retarded fascists ? " I decided not to point out that these " mentally retarded fascists " were The People , the hope of the radical left . " Read this . " She thrust her crumpled paper at me . A childish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with wild flower sketches read : " Dear Pinkos : If you want to raise your families in our town like normal people , and go to our church , and send your children to our school , we welcome you to Stark 's Bog . But if you want to destroy the family and defy the will of the Lord , we do n't need none of your kind around here corrupting our children . This is just a warning . Sincerely , Some Concerned Citi-zens . " We three stared at each other with restrained terror.  | " I think we 're in over our heads , " I suggested . " So you can see why I was upset when I drove up and saw that macho pig here , " Eddie said . " I do apologize , Ginny . " " It 's all right . " " So why was that bastard here ? " " Believe it or not , he was here to apologize for the other night . No kidding , he really was . And he was trying to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Laverne groaned . " You did n't buy one ? " Eddie asked . " I considered it . " " Oh God , life insurance ! " she wailed . " How bougie ! " " Fine . Go ahead . Ridicule me . But what 's going to happen to the Free Farm , and to you , if I die ? " " If you die , we 'll probably all die with you , " Eddie said jocularly . " Or maybe I 'll throw myself on your funeral pyre . " I was distinctly unamused . " No , really ? " " I 'm sure we 'd figure something out . You 're not as irreplaceable as you seem to think . " " I could get all the money back in about seventy years , " I pointed out thoughtfully . Laverne and Eddie fell out of their chairs with laughter . All of a sudden , Eddie stopped laughing and said darkly , " I do n't happen to buy that . " I shrugged . " Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , I mean I do n't buy the idea that insurance is his profession . " " What are you talking about ? " " Whoever heard of selling life insurance to women ? " " Not even to liberated women like us ? " " What kinds of questions did he ask you ? " I tried to reconstruct the scene . " He asked what we lived on and whom I was living here with . " " Aha ! I knew it ! He 's an FBI agent ! I 'm sure of it ! " Laverne was massaging her left thigh thoughtfully . " Oh , come on , Eddie , " she said . " Look , he was a decent friendly man , Eddie . That 's all . " " He let you believe he was decent . Do n't you see , Ginny ? He 's trying to make you fall for him so that he can use you as an informant . " Her eyes were gleaming.  | " Crap ! You 've been watching too many grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding it against you , Ginny . But he 's definitely putting the make on you . I 've seen the way he looks at you . Now , I 'm not saying that you 're responding  --  even though you have been out of the office several times when I 've stopped by . . . . But I just want you to be aware of what 's going on so that you wo n't get hurt . And so that you wo n't hurt us . The man is an FBI agent , Ginny . I 'm sure of it . " " You flatter yourself , Eddie . Why would the FBI waste its time on small-time hippies like us ? " Eddie looked injured . " Well , for lots of reasons  --  drugs , political protests , the money we 've given to countercultural enterprises . Maybe they think we 're concealing political fugitives or draft dodgers . Remember , we 're citizens of a fascist state . Why , I can think of any number of things we 've done that might merit attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may be . But I know what I know . And I know that you 'd better watch out for that man . " " You 're not jealous or anything like that ? " - " Me ? Jealous ? " She laughed . " Jealousy is a bourgeois emotion based on property instinct , and I do n't believe in private property . You 're a grown woman , Ginny . You 're free to come and go as you like , to choose friends and lovers as you deem appropriate . I would n't think of trying to restrict your options in any way whatsoever . I just want you to be cognizant of the possible political repercussions that your indiscriminate balling might have on your sisters , that 's all . " " What balling ? Christ , Eddie , I just met the man formally today ! Anyway , I do n't ball indiscriminately . You know that . But lay off me , or I might . " " Do n't threaten me , Ginny . " " I 'm not threatening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning you . " " Well , now that we 're both well-warned .... " One night after supper we all sat around the stove chewing peyote buttons that were the consistency of orange peels . I was nibbling at mine , trying to avoid swallowing . Atheliah was sharpening her ax . Mona , in languid bumbling movements , was making a couple of dried arrangements with weeds and seed pods she had gathered through the snow in the meadow that afternoon . Scattered liberally through **26;2825;TOOLONG himself to say something really nice . What is there really nice to say that would n't just sound foolish ? Even the fruit that Pete brought to the house after their father died was alwayswrong . The time he brought the oranges they had just been sent a crate of oranges from neighbors visiting Florida . Their mother made them take all the oranges out of the refrigerator  --  there were a lot of oranges  --  and put them in the crate and hide the crate so Pete 's feelings would n't be hurt . Charles had to sleep with the crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bomb there . He could n't sleep . He tried to tell his mother that the Florida oranges were better ; they should just mix Pete 's in with them . The crate stayed under the bed . Every morning they had fresh-squeezed orange juice , and at school , in their lunch box , there was always one and maybe two oranges . Susan got diarrhea . Charles did n't ; he always gave both of his oranges away . He gave them to a Japaneseboy . None of the other kids wanted the oranges . They all had cookies . When he pressed them on the Japanese boy he took them without saying anything and put them in his desk . The second day he gave them to the Japanese boy Charles noticedthat when the boy opened his desk the two oranges were still there . When there were six oranges the Japanese boy took them all home in a bag . The Japanese boy had no friends . He would n't talk to anybody , even when they talked to him . He 'd say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oranges . " Charles could never get beyond that with him . He asked him to come over to his house and play , and the boy just shook hands . When the oranges stopped coming , no questions were asked . The Japanese boy did n't come back for the sixth grade . Somebody in the class found out that he had gone to Japan . Charles had the same teacher for fifth and sixth grades . Her name was Mrs. Witwell . Of course she was called Witchwell , or just Mrs. Witch . This name was given to her when Mrs. Witwell dressed up as a witch at Halloween to pay a call on a friend 's first-grade class . She showed the fifth grade her getup : a long black skirt and blouse , pointed black hat and broom . She had powdered her face white . " The first grade will thinkp81I 'm a real witch ! " Mrs. Witwell said . Her fifth grade believed she was a real witch . The Japanese boy looked terrified . Mrs. Witwell came to the funeral parlor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with an old lady , her mother . The book was signed " Eleanor and Dora Witwell . " It was the same handwriting with which Mrs. Witwell criticizedhis penmanship . He got up and ran to look at the book when she left . He no longer has any idea what he expected to see . He turns into his driveway , surprised that Doctor Mark 's car still is n't there . He has trouble getting up the driveway ; it 's very slippery . After spinning awhile at the bottom , the car finally makes it halfway up , and he settles for that , putting on the emergency brake . " That really was n't bad with Pete , " Susan says . " He does try , " Charles says . " I just do n't feel comfortable with him . I was around him for so many years that I should , but I just do n't . " " I hope he goes ahead and buys the Honda Civic , " Susan says . " I think he 's sad . Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown man . There 's no reason he ca n't bring himself to do anything . Living with her depresses him . " " He ought to get out , " Charles says . " Do n't wish that on her , " Susan says . " What would she do ? " " Plug in the heating pads , drink , read movie magazines . What she does now . I ca n't believe she loves him . " " It 's hard to tell how she feels , " Susan says . " He should corner her and ask her that . " " That 's cruel , " Susan says . " I know . I do n't know . I feel sorry for them . I feel sorry for everybody . " " If you just categorically feel sorry for everyone , it must be something bothering you . " " That 's profound , " he says , taking off his coat . She handshim hers and sits down on the sofa , pulls the afghan over her . " Can I say something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to hear things I do n't want to hear all the time . Goahead. "  | " I think you 're an egomaniac . " Charles laughs . He had been expecting something terrible . " Yeah . So what ? " " So you dismiss everything , even helpful criticism . You refuse to think . " " Susan , I think all the time . I shake my head to try to stop the thoughts from coming . " " What do you think about ? " " Is n't that a little broad ? " " I know what you think about . You think about that girl . You deliberately make yourself suffer all the time because then you can be aware of yourself . " " What 's all this ? " he says . " Some dollar twenty-five Bantam paperback philosophy ? One of those books with multicolored arrows going off in all directions or something ? " " Do n't you think I could have any thoughts of my own ? " " Everybody 's thoughts are acquired . ' Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charles . I just realized that what I 'm saying now is true . You 're infantile . " " Thanks for coming here to stay with me so you could put me down . " " It 's not to put you down . I can tell it 's not working . You 're probably thinking of her right this minute . " " You keep bringing her up . Do n't you notice that , Susan ? " " Just tell me whether I was wrong when I said that . Were you thinking about her ? " " I was n't , " he says . He was . " You 're even a liar . I know you were thinking about her . " " I was . So what ? " " It proves my point . That you dwell on it ; you try to make yourself miserable . You 've got to snap out of it . " " What 'll happen to me if I do n't ? " he says . He really is curious , but she thinks he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach so you can accuse me of preaching . You always have to be in control , like a two-year-old . " Sam comes into the living room . He has on the same pajamas , the same ski socks.  | " She 's giving me hell , " Charles says . " I heard , " Sam says . " Hi , " Susan says . " Hi , " Sam says . " Some woman not Laura called , " he says to Charles . " How do you know ? " " I know her voice . I 'm very good with people 's voices on the phone . " " A woman . . . who was it ? " " I should have asked . I was asleep . Was n't thinking . " " Then it might have been Laura . " " No . I 'd know her voice . " " Did she say she 'd call back ? " " Yeah . " Charles shrugs . Sam sits down on the floor and takes the ashtrayoff the sofa arm , lights a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This thing wiped the shit out of me , " Sam says . " Mark did n't call again ? " Susan says . " Nope , " Sam says . Sam sits with his elbows resting on his knees . He seems to have lost weight . His hair is dirty and stringy . He is still just as hoarse when he talks . Charles no longer thinks that he is dying of pneumonia . He is glad . He has known Sam since fourth grade , when Sam 's family moved to the area . He remembers Sam 's mother holding her son 's hand , leading him into the fourth-grade classroom . Sam whirled and slapped her hand as they came through the door . Sam was a troublemaker . Charles was not . He worshiped Sam . Sam would pretend to have coughing fits so that he 'd be excused to get a drink of water , and then he 'd go into the bathroom and get the door off the stall before he came back . Sam was quick , and he always had the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinkingfountain , and when everybody came in from the blacktop and raced for the fountain , the handle was gone . He was too smart to have it on him when the teacher checked . He had put it in a girl 's desk . After school the teacher watched Sam , so he could n't get it . The next morning when the girl opened herp84desk she found it and gave it to the teacher . Sam waited until the end of fifth grade , but he finally thought of the perfect thing to do : throw a mud ball at her . The girl threw a mud ball back and hit him in the forehead . There was a rock or something in her mud ball , and he still has the scar above his left eyebrow . Charles picks up a pile of mail and opens first a small blue envelope addressed to him in unfamiliar handwriting . It is a small blue booklet : " Why you did n't get a Christmas card from us . " He begins reading : " Did you wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christmas card from Carolyn and Bud ? The answer can be quickly given : Carolyn and Bud were having problems . But there 's more to the story than that . After all , each could have sent a card . But each was too preoccupiedduring the season of brotherly love to do so . To wit : Bud told Carolyn a week before Christmas that he was going to divorce her for a blonde cutie . Carolyn cried , agreed . Bud ran off that night with the cutie , and Carolyn ran around in her sweat suit in the cold streets all night , crazy with jealousy . The next morning she found Bud back , but she threw him out . The cutie called : Please , Carolyn , take him back . I know he never loved me . Not on your life ( jog , jog ) . Bud then got irate . Mad at both of them . Would Bud have thought of sending you a Christmas card ? Non , mesdames . Non , messieurs . Would Carolyn ? Non . But here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hoping your New Year is Merry . ' On the back page is written : " Sequel : Bud and C. are back together . How tasteless of C. to send this . Wait till Bud finds out . Will you be the one to tell ? Love , C. " " Whew , " Charles says . " Take a look at this , or did you alreadyget one ? " Carolyn works at the store with Sam . Once he and Charles had dinner at their apartment . That was at least a year ago . How did they get his address ? " What do you make of that ? " Charles says . " I 'm reading , " Sam says . " What is it ? " Susan says . " A crazy letter sort of thing from Sam 's friends . "  | " Good God , " Sam says , reading . " We went over there for dinner one time . Remember ? " " Good God , " Sam says , tossing it back to Charles . " Is n't anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not crazy , " Susan says . " You two are depressed all the time . " " You 'd be depressed too if you felt like I do , " Sam says . " That 's not what I mean . I mean all the time . " " You 're not here all the time . How do you know ? " Susan sighs , goes into the kitchen . " I 'm too depressed to apply my usual trenchant wit , " Sam says . " I was n't depressed until she started in , " Charles says . The phone rings . It is Pete , sounding very drunk . " You do n't want to hear any more from me tonight , do you ? " Pete says . He does not say " Hello . " " Hello , " Charles says , stalling for time . " Hello ? ' " Pete says . " I said hello . Now I 've got to know the answer to my question . " " Pete , you profess to love her . You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juiced the night before she comes home . " " Do n't criticize me , " Pete says . " Just answer my question . " " You asked if I was glad to hear from you , did n't you ? I was , Pete , until it turned out that you were drunk . " " In my day a youngster would never never speak to an old man that way . " " Pete , you 're not an old man . Try to cheer up . She 's coming home tomorrow and it might work out this time . " " I 've got one thing to tell you , " Pete says . " I found the pillow . Do you know where I found it ? In the attic . Some birds had gotten into it . It will never , never work out . " " Pete , maybe some friend of yours not so close to the problemcould advise you better than I can . I do n't really know what to say . " " What did you say was the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . " " Pete , you 're drunk . Where are you ? "  | " I 'm at home . ' Where do you think my attic is ? " " I 'm glad to hear that , because the driving is very dangerous . You 're just drinking at home ? " " If I went nuts , " Pete says , " I would n't have anybody to take care of me . My brother came from Hawaii . Now where is he ? Running around an orchid patch . Eating macadamia nuts . I do n't know . I do n't have anybody but myself to depend on . " " Would you like me to come over ? " Charles says . " That 's very decent of you . But I do n't want you to come . " " Okay . I hope things go okay tomorrow . Take it easy , Pete . " " Are there any old people you like a lot ? " Pete asks . Charles does not know any old people . " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nothing personal , " Petesays . " I 'm glad to hear that . You 're a very honest young fellow . Now tell me honestly , Charles , what was it you said was theworst thing I ever did to you ? " " In the bar I told you about the time Susan made the snowmanwith your wood . You never really did one particularly rottenthing to me , Pete . I do n't hate you , and I never did . I 'm not too close to you . That 's all . You never paid any attention to Susan or me . We never talked . How can you expect us to talk now ? " " You mean that if I had a boy he 'd talk to me the same way ? " Pete says . " My own boy would shoot straight from the hip , too ? " " That 's just an assumption I make , Pete . I do n't know very many people my age who do n't have trouble talking to their parents . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean to console me , do n't you ? " " Yeah , " Charles says . He sits in the chair , figuring he 's in for a long talk . Pete hangs up . " Pete ? Hello ? " Charles puts the phone down , shakes his head , goes back to the living room . The phone rings again immediately . " He 's not making a monkey of me , " Charles says . Susan gets up.  | " I 'm not going to talk to him again , " Charles says . It is DoctorMark , who will be there within the hour . Sam sighs and goes to bed . Charles sits beside Susan on the sofa and stares across the room . There are tiny cracks in the wall . Fitting , fitting . He takes off his shoes , puts his feet under him . It is cold in the house . Is it less cold or more cold in Laura 's A-frame ? Susan files a fingernail . Charles looks through the rest of the mail : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audubon Society , telling him that animals are dying . He can buy a set of " endangered species " glasses , or salt and pepper shakers with cardinals on them . A letter from the Humane Society , telling him that people throw their kittens in trash cans , etc. , and asking for money . An overdue notice for The French Lieutenant 's Woman . It is eleven o'clock . In nine and a half hours he will be sitting at his desk . He wishes he could work at night when nobody was there . He asked his boss about that , and his boss said , " You 're lucky I do n't say anything about your taking off for lunch at five of eleven . " " I only take an hour for lunch , " Charles said . " You ca n't work at night , " his boss said . One night his boss asked him if he wanted to be in a poker game " over the line . " Charles said he did n't know how to play poker . His boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his work , but the personal things he has found out about him : ready for lunch at eleven , wants to work at night , ca n't play poker , has a boxwood plant in his window . " What 's the story on that ? " his boss said , pointing to the little white plastic container with the little green bush in it . " I bought it in the supermarket , " Charles said . Charles did n't think he was being evasive . Behind his back , his boss tells people that he is evasive even about small things . In five years he has had two promotions . He is probably going to get a third promotion . After the first promotion he moved into a different building , the building he is in now and the building he will stay in , even if he gets the third promotion . He has always requisitioned an unusually large number of U. S. Government pens and boxes of paper clips , which he gives away : a box to Susan at school , a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the telephone " ) ; he evenp88gave Laura a box once , and that was crazy , because she could have requisitioned a box if she had wanted them . When he began working there everyone wore a jacket and tie . Now nobody does . He has a jacket hanging on the coatrack in his office just in case , but he has never had to put it on except for a few days in the summer when the air conditioning got so cold that he needed it . When he heard that he might be getting anotherpromotion he had a nightmare in which his secretary  --  he would have a secretary if he got the promotion  --  came into his office and he said to her , " Take a letter . Any letter . " Then he laughed wildly . The woman stood there . In the dream she had been a short , brown-haired woman , not as old as he might have feared . His first building was n't bad . It was a ten-story brown brick building , and he walked up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Now he works in a mud-colored glass building and only walks to his office on the twenty-first floor once a week , on Friday . One Friday , walking up , his cassetteplayer going , he saw an employee flatten himself against the wall , wide-eyed , frightened , obviously , of what might have been coming for him . The employee had acted very strangely . It was about the sixteenth or seventeenth floor and Charles was very winded , so he just lifted his hand in greeting . The employeeran under his arm , like an animal running out a gate . There were a lot of nervous people in the building , and it always seemed to him that quite a number of women coming out of the rest room looked as if they had been crying . Laura said that was n't so ; she had never seen a woman crying in the rest room . He was always surprised that so many people in the employees ' cafeteria kept their plates on the wet brown tray . He always took the dishes off and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ate right from the tray . The knock on the door is Doctor Mark . He rushes in when Susan opens the door as if he 's really glad to be there . He is as she described him . Passing him on the street , Charles might have thought he was a musician . His hands , circling Susan 's back , are very large and graceful . In a bar , Charles might have mistaken him for a homosexual.  | " How do you do ? " Mark says , extending one of the big hands . Susan is still pressed against him with the other . Charles shakes his hand . " Hello , " he says . " Mighty cold and snowy , " Mark says . The big hand goes back around Susan . " Can I get you some coffee ? " Charles says . " I take no artificial stimulants , " Mark says . " But . Thank you. , , " Milk ? " Charles says . Is there any milk ? " I 'm loaded with calcium for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion of him . He would never work up to Disque Bleu 's . The most he can hope for is Gauloises . " Sue , Sue , let me look at you , " he says . Definitely homosexual . " It 's very nice , you letting me barge in on you tonight , " Mark says . Charles frowns . Susan hugs Mark 's neck , lets go of him to sit in a chair . " May I stay the night ? I 'm afraid I 'm . Much too late to start back now . " " Sure , " Charles says . " May I ask . How is your mother ? " " She 's going home tomorrow , Mark , " Susan says . " That 's very lucky , " Mark says , emphasizing the words to convey that it is not . " Just before you came Pete called , though , and he 's drunk again . " " That actually kills brain cells , " Mark says . " I do n't think he cares . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles says . " That 's it ! " Mark says . " In the final analysis it 's up to the individual . No amount of coaxing can make a person care who does not want to care . " Mark 's voice goes up loudly on the last five words . Charles looks at Mark 's feet . Soaking wet tennis shoes . " Take your shoes off . I can get you some socks . . . . "  | " No , no , " Mark says , as if Charles had asked to see his penis . " I 'm fine . Feet are fine . " " They 're wet , " Charles says . Mark frowns . " Rose hips ? " he says . " What ? " Charles says , leaning forward . " Rose hips , " Mark replies . " He does n't have any , " Susan says . " Ah , " Mark says , as if delighted . " How was your trip ? " Susan asks . " My trip . Well , I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by Brahms . A wonderful station that played much Brahms the last stretch . " " Are you a musician ? " Charles says . " I play piano . Unprofessionally . " Charles wants very much to ask if he 's gay . " I-Iow was the car ? " Susan asks . " Well . I can tell you it started off with problems . And a stopover at a service station was necessary because of overheating . Clouds of smoke came out of the car . A small puncture . In . The hose . " Charles breaks into a smile . That 's it . . . the guy talks like a J. P. Donleavy character . " Do you read Donleavy ? " Charles asks . " Donelly ? " Marks says . He turns his head to the side . Charles wishes he had a kidskin glove to slap his cheek with . " No , no , Donleavy ! Yes . The Ginger Man . " Mark looks at Charles , expecting the conversation to go on . " Of course I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mark says . " What would you like to read ? " Charles asks . " You 're being obnoxious , " Susan says . Charles is genuinely curious . He wishes Susan knew that . She misunderstands him , thinks he 's obnoxious every time he 's curious . " Jane Austen , " Mark says with gravity . Figures . And probably Thomas Pynchon , too . " I 've got a copy of Gravity 's Rainbow I 'm done with . Would you like it ? " Charles says.  |p91The  head turns to the side again . " By ... ? " Mark says . " Pynchon . " " Ah ! Pynchon . V. " Susan is filing a fingernail . " Thank you , but I have little time to read novels . " " I guess med school is really rough , " Charles says . " Susan says you plan to specialize in surgery . " " Neurosurgery , yes , " Mark says . " I read a thing in some newspaper about a doctor in some South American country who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned them and picked off tumors and put the eyes back . To cure her of migraines and double vision . " " God ! " Marks says . " That 's revolting . That 's not possible , I 'm sure . " " Oh God , " Susan groans . " No wonder people are afraid of doctors when they read things like that , " Mark says . " That 's sickening , " Susan says . " Did you make that up ? " " No . It 's in the same paper that has a denial from representativesof Frank Zappa that Frank Zappa had a bowel movement on stage . " " Oh God , " Susan says . " I follow those rags for kicks , " Charles says . " You know , they 're still full of JFK gossip . JFK jumping out of women 's windows when he was President , JFK a vegetable on Onassis 's island . . . . " Susan puts down the fingernail file . " I 'm going to have something to drink , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mark says . " Maybe I 'll go to bed , " Charles says . " It 's been another long , though glorious , day . " Mark stands . " Thank you very . Much for your kindness , " he says . " You 're welcome , " Charles says . " Good night , " Susan says , going into the kitchen . " Good night , " Charles says . In his dream that night Charles is sitting behind a desk  --  in his office , presumably  --  and Mark is standing in front of him.  | " Take a letter . Any letter , " Charles says , and wakes up laughing . The house is silent . He hopes they did n't hear him . He lies there with his eyes open for some time , listening to the silence . What if JFK is a vegetable somewhere ? He closes his eyes and pictures Kennedy , round-faced and thick-haired , then sees him as a dancing green pepper , his smiling round face a little knob on top . He opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ian Fleming . Ian Fleming was turned into a neurotic by his crazy mother . He closes his eyes and pictures Sean Connery driving a broad-nosed sports car that metamorphosesinto a corncob . He opens his eyes again . He is hungry . He imagines dancing apples . There is nothing good in the house to eat . Tomorrow he will go to the Grand Union and buy all his favorite foods . Grand . Holden Caulfield hated that word . He thought it was phony . That cover illustration of Catcher In The Rye : Holden in a big gray overcoat , hat turned around , pointing down his back . Saw a movie once starring William Holden that was scary . Ca n't remember the title or the plot , just the name William Holden . The dancing apples . " Aw , c'm on now , Mama . . . . " " Ge00000000rge Stevens ! " George Washington .

Guy Fawkes Day . Firecrackers . Fanne Foxe , The ArgentineFirecracker . " Ya-hoo , I 'm just a country girl from Argentina . " The girl from the north country . She once was a true love of mine . Laura . Laura against the bookshelf : " What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? " " Aw , now , Sapphire , I can explain .. "  | " You do n't look like you had a very good night , " Betty says to him . " I did n't . There was a lot of stuff going on . " In my head , he thinks . I 'm going crazy . My mother is crazy , but they 're letting her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's already out . Maybe at lunchtime I 'll get a phone call . " This all ? " Betty asks , taking two pieces of paper out of his basket . " So far . More to come . " Looney Tunes : " T-t-t-t-thu-that 's all , folks ! " Betty walks out . She is not wearing the black boots ; she has on a pair of brown high-heeled shoes . He is disappointed ; he had come to think of the boots as part of an outfit . The boots made her look very . . . substantial . Damn . He stops working on the report he has already stopped working on ten times , and fills out a requisition form for Steel City paper clips . In the third grade a boy hit another boy in the nose with a paper clip launched from a rubber band . The paper clip went flying across the room and went up the kid 's nostril . The school doctor got it out . The school doctor was a heavy middle-aged man who told the kids to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once a year he weighed themp94and looked them over . " Doctor Dan finds nothing wrong with you , " he said . He always called himself Doctor Dan . He goes back to his report , finishes it , and leans back in his chair before starting another . There are only four more to do . If they 're as easy to do as the last one , he can probably get half of them done before lunch . Of course , if he were going to lunch at eleven o'clock that would n't be true . Damn . He looks at the next report . He fills out the first line , then drifts away , thinking about what a mistake it will be for his sister to marry Doctor Mark . Why should jerks like that get to tell decent people that they have inoperable melanomas ? If neurosurgeons ever get to say that . They must get to say it . Sure . " An inoperable melanoma near the occipital lobe . " He can just hear him saying that . Then he 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just marrying her for respectability . He 'll tell some poor jerk he has an inoperable melanoma near the occipital lobe and then run off to a gay bar . Then he 'll run home to Susan . By then she 'll have a lot of kids and not care if he 's there or not . She 'll have a Maytag and probably be so dumb that she 'll let them take a picture of her with it  --  a green Maytag and several white-faced children . Her hair style will be out of date , her legs a bit too fat . One of the kids will not be looking into the camera . One will be in her arms . Doctor Mark will be to the far left , towering over his family : wife , children , Maytag . He will have a late model Cadillac : the Cadillac Eldorado . Where the hell is Eldorado ? Probably some place full of humidity and peasants .

SCOTCH : Dewar 's " White Label " He looks at the report again . He has been doodling on it . Christ . He gets a fresh form and starts again . Susan is right . He would like it if he were an artist . Then he 'd know fascinating people instead of women who cry in bathrooms . Even Sam 's dog was more interesting than anybody that works in this place . Sam 's dog was so smart she could lip-read . " Go in the other room " Sam would mouth to her , and she 'd look dejected and walk into the kitchen . " Dinner , " he 'd mouth , and she 'd run for one of her toys , prance with it in eagerness . One of them was a yellow squeaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pupsie Cola . " Even the names of her dog toys are more interesting than the names of the employees : Stan Greenwall , Bob Charters , Betty . . . Betty what ? Maybe just Betty  --  Betty of the erotic dreams , the ones it will be difficult to have , since her dresses stick to her . When he sees her later , he will find out her last name . Then he can call her for a date , and maybe when he knows her better he can have erotic dreams about her . Maybe that will even make Laura jealous . She said once that Betty hardly ever had a date . Who would she date ? Recently divorced Bob Charters , who flicked the back of his hand against Charles 's shoulder when they were standing side by side at the urinal and told him now that he was divorced , he was looking to go yodeling in the gully ? His own boss , who wears a button with the female symbol on it inside his trench coat and shows it to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal a naked woman painted in lurid colors ? Or Bob White  --  he must have taken a lot of kidding about that name  --  who never says anything except in the elevators , when he says he 's sorry to be there or glad he 's leaving ? What happens to girls like Betty if they do n't get married , and how do they ever get a husband ? How do they ever get to move to Ohio and have a fantastically reliable Maytag ? He proposed to a woman once . She said she was already married . She said it pressed up against a row of books in the library , whispered to him to get away , people would see and think he was crazy . Hep96was always cornering her  --  in restaurants , when the coat-check girl turned to get their coats , on the Tilt-A-Whirl , pressing her to one side before the machine even started and tilted them there . Well , maybe it would n't have worked out . Look where his mother and Pete 's marriage ended up : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . But maybe his marrying Laura would have worked out . He begins to write figures on the piece of paper . He is not making much progress . He will never get a promotion if he does n't apply himself . When he was thirteen his mother made him take dancing lessons . They were given in a church basementthat was always cold . The girls all had bad breath or big breasts he was afraid to touch . He was an awkward dancer , and he did n't improve . The dancing instructor hated him . She 'd clap her hands together slowly as he and the girl he was dancing with whirled by , meaning for them to get closer . She always showed her bottom teeth when she clapped her hands . The woman refused to give him his diploma . She sent a diploma in the mail about a week after the course was over , but in the space where his name should have been was printed : NOT YOU . " That awful woman , " his mother had said , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance . " Dance with me , " Clara had said . " Let me see whether you can dance . " He told her that he could n't , but she still made him . She towered over him  --  no chance of running into her breasts , thank God . And after a few twirls his mother dropped the subject , except for telling his father that his money had gone down the drain . Another report finished , he takes off for lunch . He has fried shrimp and a beer and mashed potatoes that can be lifted all in one mound with his fork . He eats part of the potatoes and plays with the rest , pays the bill , and walks back to the office . Passing the typing pool , he sees that Betty is eating at her desk . He goes in and pulls an orange plastic chair up to her desk . Two women at desks in back of her who were talking normally begin to whisper . There is a brown vase on Betty 's desk with four paper flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paperweightwith a picture of a cat inside . Doctors tell old people ,  |p97|peo|ple  whose mates have died , to get a pet  --  something to love . Betty must already have given up . " Is that your cat ? " he says . " Yes . That was a Christmas present from my nephews . " " My best friend had a dog that died not long ago , " he says . Why did he say that ? " Did it have heartworms ? " " What 's that ? " " Heartwonns . They can cure a dog once , usually , if they get it in time . " " I do n't know what it died of . It just died . " Betty shakes her head . " Heartworms , I bet . " Betty is eating cottage cheese . She is trying . She is trying to lose weight so she will get a husband and not have to rely on her Siamese cat . Poor Betty . If only she were Laura he would love her madly , blindly , forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me today , " he says . " Have you gone to lunch ? " she says . " I 'm on my way back . " " Oh , " she says . " Okay . I 'll be down for them later . " He leaves , convinced that there 's no possibility of romance . She should have said something witty . She is so dogged . But what could she have said witty ? What 's the witty comeback about a dead dog ? If she were Hemingway , at least she would have said something strange  --  that a dead dog lying in the sun was beautiful . But she is Betty . She says Sam 's dog died of heartworms , which can be cured once , usually . Unlike inoperablemelanomas . He gets a drink of water at the water fountain , hoping to wash down the glutinous mashed potatoes . They are still right there , even after a long drink . Why did n't you even try to be a painter ? he asks himself as he sits down to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You could paint primitives  --  then it would n't matter if they were sort of sloppy . The sun is in the middle of the window . In the morning it is on the left , at noon in the middle , and to the far right before it gets dark and he goes home . He amuses himself by thinking that the sun rises and sets in his window , that it is confined to this rectangle , that the window is like one of those games theyp98have in bars , with the little squares that beep from left to right . If he does n't find out Betty 's last name or her phone number , he will be spending another Friday night in a bar with Sam . He would ask Sam to come along , but the women always fall in love with Sam . Except Laura . She just thought Sam was nice . Sam did n't fall in love with Laura either . Oh , hell  --  it was perfect . His best friend did n't love his girlfriend . The three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ( 4:25 today ) he leaves the building . Bob White is in the elevator . He wants to say " Bob White ! Bob White ! " to him , chirp it at him , and he bites his tongue . Susan is right ; he is infantile . " Glad to be going , " Bob White says . " Yeah , " Charles agrees . " Going to juvenile court with my kid tonight , " Bob White says . Charles looks at him for the explanation . " Threw a bottle through a window , " Bob White says . Bob White gets out first , quickly walks through the lobby to the revolving door and disappears . Charles stops at the blind man 's stand and picks up an Almond Joy . " What have you got ? " the blind man asks . Sometimes , Charles is convinced , he just stops at the stand because the blind man 's question has such a nice ironic ring . Going out of the building , he wonders if Marsha Steinberg would defend him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Betty her last name . Well , all these things we forget are deliberately forgotten . Thanks , Freud . You probably would have forgotten too . The more exoticappealed to you . The more exotic appeal to me . He crunches into his Almond Joy . At home , he sorts through the day 's mail : a letter from the Humane Society saying that kittens are being thrown in the trash , a note left in the mailbox from Susan , thanking him for " a good time , " a Burpee 's seed catalog . The bed that Sam slept in is a mess in one bedroom . He did not make the bed he slept in the night before . He goes into the bathroom , which is relativelyuncluttered , and soaks a washrag in warm water , rubs it over his face . It is quiet in the house . He turns on the televisionand lies in bed to watch it . Sam 's snowmobile socks are hanging off each side of the bed rail . Like the coquette who forgetsher handkerchief , Sam will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane crash , the parents of a child who was roughed up in a Boston school , and a word about former President Nixon going golfing .

Let 's see ; she left the day before yesterday ... " Mrs. Reynolds , get hold of yourself . I 'm sure she 's back at school . " " Did she tell you I was an alcoholic ?

And the police will find his fingerprints on her coat  --  he lifted her coat from the sofa when she was here  --  and they will come to work and arrest him .

Then she 'll be sorry . Then , too late , she 'll realize that she did n't want her husband and Rebecca . She 'll go back to work in the same library , just to be in the building where he once cornered her against the bookshelf . Twice . Three times at least . He puts a box of taco hors d'oeuvres in the oven and finds a beer in the bottom of the refrigerator that he decides to save to go with the tacos .

Laura used to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off her stockings and go get a pair of the soft gray socks she had given him and stand in the kitchen in the socks , cooking dinner . In her dress and socks she looked like some bobbysoxer . If he had known her in the fifties they would have jitterbugged . She would have worn a ribbon in her hair , and a long pleated skirt , blazer , and white socks and saddle shoes . The socks would have a funny weave that looked like rivulets when they got twisted around a little . Gon na rock , gon na rock around the clock tonight . The kitchen clock says five-thirty . That gives him enough time for a shower . But does he want a shower ? No . He wants that beer . But does n't he want it with the tacos ? Yes . People 's problems should end when they get home from work . They do n't . No wonder men go home and knock their kids around . There 's only one beer , which will be great with the tacos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so when the kidp104says that a wheel came off his bicycle the father looks at the wheel , picks it up , and pushes it over the kid 's head , the kid goes around yowling , the wheel like a clown 's ruffle , his wife says he 's a beast , separates from him , divorces him . If only Laura would push a wheel over Rebecca 's head . Not very likely . She goes to parent 's day , is " room mother " for the kindergarten , bakes special gingerbread cookies for the kids , who all love her . " She was such a nice woman , you 'd never think she 'd push a wheel over her child 's head . " And , in fact , she wo n't . She 'll just cook a nice nourishing dinner and then tuck Rebecca in , and what she does after that is too painful to think about . Maybe she will call him , though . She wo n't .

A double chin ? No  --  he was looking down . His hair is dirty . Why bother to wash it for Pamela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . Okay , okay . He drapes his clothes over the toilet seat and gets in the shower . " I 'm singing ' in the tub , just singin ' in the tub , a glorious feeling , I 'm showering again . .. " He learned that song from Sam . Sam does it complete with twirls and kicks . Charles is sure he 's going to fall in the bathtub and break his legs . Charles holds on to the soap dish and gives a kick . Sam is crazy . He gets out of the shower in time to answer the phone . It isp106cold in the kitchen . He jumps off the floor , jogs in place to stop his feet from freezing . " Yeah ? " he says . " Hello ? " " Hello , my boy . How are things with you tonight ? " " Hi , Pete . I 'll call you back . Just got out of the shower . " " You do that , then , " Pete says . They did not talk long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . Shivering , Charles goes into the bedroom and throws his towel over a floor lamp he never uses . He puts on a pair of gray socks , a pair of corduroy pants , and a blue button-downshirt . Over that he pulls a sweater with an antelope standing on top of a mountain . He bought the sweater because he thought it was funny : a very realistically knitted antelope on top of a pointed brown mound . Very stark , very ugly . " Hello , little fellow , " the salesman writing up the sale said , stroking the antelope . Charles has not liked the sweater since then , rarely puts it on . He tried to give it to the dog , but she was only interested in sleeping on it once . He looks around him . His room has looked just the same since the day he moved in . His mother used to have winter and summer bedspreads , winter and summer curtains . ' When he lived at home , his winter bedspread had been a yellow and brown plaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to sit on . The summer bedspread was beige and green crinkle crepe with a large dust ruffle . He had said that he was n't having a bedspread with any damn ruffle . She had said that it was a " dust ruffle , " as though that excused it . He had threatened to cut it off . His father had been sent to his room . His father said that it was a bedspread in good taste , one that he would n't mind having on his own bed . " Then take the thing ! " Charles had shouted . His father nodded . He removed the bedspread and carried it into the master bedroom , took the bedspread off their double bed and handed it to Charles . Charles was embarrassed ; he felt as if he was holding a jar of tonsils , or the blownoffhead of a friend . He held the big bedspread reverently . He watched his father put the single bedspread on the double bed . Of course it did not fit . It looked silly . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his father asked . Charles quickly gave him back his own bedspread , left in defeat andp107humiliation , trailing his green and beige bedspread with him . He put it back on his bed . " I did n't think you 'd want my room to look like that , " his father said , passing his room . His father never fought with him . He played dumb , as he did with the bedspread exchange , or explained patiently ( which his mother was incapable of ) why something had to be a certain way . Most logical men live a long time , but Charles 's father dropped dead at thirty-nine . He would have been logical in his old age , but there was no old age . Charles stands in the doorway of his room , thinking about how the room could be changed . Instead of being against the wall , the desk could be moved against the window . And the bed could be moved from the back wall to the side wall . There would be a little more space in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room must be changed . He takes the things off the top of his bureau and puts them on the bed , shoves the bureau where his desk used to be , at the same time shoving the desk into the middle of the room . A lamp falls over , does not break . He stands it upright on the floor . He moves the dresser into place . He puts all the things back on top , shoved together : a picture of his mother and father on their first anniversary , a picture of him holding Susan when she was an infant ( he can still remember his mother arranging the baby in his arms ; he had thrust her forward , his arms straight out , so that she blocked his face in the lens , and his mother had rushed to him and crooked his arm and lowered her into it ) , a glass bowl with pennies , a hairbrush , a dirty ascot that got dirty not from wear but from dust settling on it over a twoyearperiod , a dried-up philodendron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a flashlight . He pushes the desk across the rug . Maybe now that it faces the window he will enjoy sitting at it more . ' What will be ever use it for ? He could figure out the bills there . He wo n't . He could do what his mother always did with useless pieces of furniture  --  put a tableclothover it . He does not own a tablecloth . Maybe a sheet . No , that would look silly , to have a desk with a sheet over it . Everybodywould know it was a desk . Sam would demand an explanation . Moving the bed is a bigger problem . He pushes hard , bunching the rug underneath the bed . He lifts the bottom ofp108the bed and pushes the rug with his foot . He hopes that he does not get a hernia . There was a boy in the sixth grade who had a hernia that had to be operated on . The class sent him a card . Nobody knew what message to write , so almost everybody wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . " Some peopleasked how the food was . One girl refused to sign the card . She told the teacher that her mother would write a note saying she did n't have to . The teacher said that it was n't necessary . He gives the bed a final shove . The rug is a little bunched up , but so what ? Sam can help him the next time he 's over . He backs up , sweating , and looks over his work . He picks up the lamp and puts it back on the desk . The room looks much better . He should rearrange the whole house . Except that there is hardly any other furniture . He sold most of it to an antique dealer , a frail old man who went from room to room exclaiming " Staffordshire ! Hepplewhite ! A gateleg table ! " Charles just wanted all the ugly , smelly stuff out of there . The antique dealer gave him a lot of money . At least at the time he thought it was a lot of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man said , holding a bowl to his chest . He went away and returned with his " assistant , " an enormously fat asthmatic woman who followed him from room to room repeating " Hepplewhite ! A gateleg ! " reverently . For a while Charles was afraid they 'd just keep wandering like some poor damned souls in Dante , but after wheezing and exclaiming through the rooms they went away and came back with a blue truck and a terrier that ran yapping through the house . They did not allude to the dog . Charles could not figure out why it was there . When they did not summon the dog to leave , and it just appeared and ran out the door , Charles thought he might have been hallucinating . The fat woman lowered the antiques into piles of newspapers that she quickly wrapped around them , and the man removed drawers from dressers and tossed cushions onto the floor . " Any Sandwich ? " the woman asked breathlessly , and Charles had thought that she was asking for food . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lowered into crates as she sang " God Bless the Child " ; an oil lamp disappeared into a mound of paper as she crooned " Do n't Worry ' Bout Me . " Charles did n't know what room top109stand in  --  whether he should appear not to notice what was happening or whether he should offer to help . Should n't they discuss money before the things were wrapped in newspaper ? " You can help yourself , but do n't take too much , " the woman sang huskily , occasionally breaking off to get her breath . " Oh , Grandma ! " she shouted with glee sometimes , when she saw a painted dish or a small colored photograph . The old man worked silently and very quickly . " I need your help , young fellow , " he said , and Charles helped him carry the things out . " I want to tell you something , " he said as they raised a love seat into the blue van . " That woman is my sister . " Charles waited for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , rubbed his hands together , and said , " Let 's go . " They carried more things out . Later , in the kitchen , the woman talked about her " husband , " saying that the work was getting too rough for him . Their names were Bess and Bert , and their antique business was known as " Best Bird Antiques . " There was a cluster of flying birds painted across the back door of the van with white paint . " Best Bird Antiques " was lettered above the clouds . In three hours they were gone , and Charles had one thousand four hundred dollars . The woman climbed into the back of the van and slammed the door behind her . She was singing " A Fine Romance . " The old man gave him the money in cash . " She ca n't bear to see me actually part with money , " the old man said . " I buy antiques on Mondays , if there 's more you want to part with . Ca n't tell what you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part with in the attic , probably . We do n't go into attics . But come to our store on Mondays , which is buying day . She makes that grocery day , because she ca n't bear to see me fork over money for antiques ! Well , thanks mighty much , and here you go . " He shoved a wad of money into Charles 's outstretched hand . Charles 's hand had been extended to shake the man 's hand good-bye . In all the confusion , he had forgotten about getting paid . The little dog barked in the front seat . The man touched his fingers to his forehead in a salute as the van pulled away . Charles waved . He later took several hand-painted plates he found to the man 's antique store . Sure enough , the fat woman was n't there . " Do n't look around the place , the inflated prices will make youp110sick , " the man said . Charles took his advice , left with twenty dollars . There was a sign in an ornate frame over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Best Bet . " " ' We used to have a racehorse named that , " the man said , noticing that Charles was looking at the sign . " It broke its leg . I said , No more racehorses , ' My sister was amenable . " Charles goes into the kitchen and dials Pete 's number . " What are you panting for ? " Pete asks . " I just moved some furniture around . " " Oh , " Pete says . " Well , I 've been straightening up around here the last couple of days , too . Furniture seems to creep forward in the room for some reason . I shoved it all back against the walls . Not right against them because of the paint , but about an inch away . " " How 's Mom ? " Charles asks . " She 's doing just fine . I know she 'd want to talk to you , except that she 's having a bath right now . " Pete whispers , " Door 's open . " " Christ , Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 'll electrocute herself with . " " No she does n't , " Pete says , sounding hurt . " I told you the "  --  he lowers his voice  --  " the door 's open . " He can picture it : she is sitting in hot water . She does not put any bubble bath in the water . She just sits there , sinks down in the tub until the hot water is collarbone level . She plays the radio . If she stays long enough ( she takes many of these baths a day ) she reads movie magazines , and if she stays for a very long time she starts to imagine pains and she cries . Someone has to haul her out . Charles and Pete have told the doctors about her dips . They think it 's a good idea to " soak to relax . " Even when they are told what really happens , they still say that there 's nothing wrong with a hot bath . They think she is clever to have thought of that " to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her chin on her collarbone , the magazines drowned in the tub , heating pads plugged into several sockets , radio blaring . If only one of them was home , they could n't lift her . She was angry when they appeared in the bathroom and shook her awake . " I was relaxing ! I have no privacy ! I had a pain in my back  --  I was warming the heating pad for that ! " Thep111towels always smell bad and need to be washed . There is bath powder all over the bath rug . Movie magazines with moldy covers and curled edges are stacked on the back of the toilet . The bathtub and toilet are blue ; the tile is brown and white  --  small brown and white tiles covered with a film of bath powder . " What I called about , " Pete says , " is that I thought it might be nice to have a little welcome home celebration for Mommy . " " Pete , you always put on that phony diction . When you 're not thinking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother . ' That sounds more dignified . " " How I wish I had a flesh-and-blood son I could kill for talkingthat way , " Pete says . " But you 're all I 've got . I thought you and I were getting along better now after the  --  after the drink we had . The very nice time we just had . " " Yeah . That was nice . I only mention it , Pete , because I think we might get along better if you knew about the things that bothered me . Then I know you would n't do them and we 'd get along even better . " " There 's too wide a gap . I do n't think we 'd ever get along very well . Maybe if you were my own flesh and blood you 'd be indebted to me . " " I do n't want you to take offense , Pete . I just want you to know that that 's a little thing that annoys me . " " Well , I 'll tell you something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scoutmaster , and you knew I built birdhouses and did stuff like that . All the other kids asked their fathers , and you never even approached me . " " I never thought you 'd be interested , Pete . We did n't talk much , so I did n't think you 'd want to deal with a whole troop of boys my age . " " Maybe we would have talked more if we had had things to talk about . Birdhouses and things like that . I knew how to build stuff . I would have been a good leader for you boys . " " I 'm sorry I never asked , Pete . I just assumed wrong . " " Well , it 's too late now , " Pete says . " Do n't worry about it , then . Just do n't worry about it . " " That 's right . What 's that saying ? Lord give me patience top112change the things I can change and not worry about those I ca n't , ' or something like that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to you on the phone , Charles . When I make a comment it does n't seem to lead anywhere . " " I do n't know what else to say , Pete . You remember the sayingbetter than I do , so I do n't have anything to add . " " You 're a very impatient person , I think , " Pete says . " But I want to get back to the reason for this call . You 've got me so flustered I ca n't remember if I already said this , but I wanted to ask whether you could n't come over on Saturday night for dinnerto welcome Clara home . " He punches the " Clara . " " Pete . . . you know she wo n't get a dinner together . " " I can get the dinner . I 'm cooking . All you 've got to do is grace us with your presence . If I can be blunt , I do n't even want you for dinner myself after this bad phone conversation , but your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . Anybody can cook chicken . " " Okay . I 'll be there . " " Okay , " Pete says . " Do n't forget . " " It 'll be on my mind all week , Pete . " " Talk nice to me ! I 'm sixty-three years old . " " I 'll see you then , Pete . " " I hate to hang up this way . I feel like you 've insulted me , yet I 'm on the defensive . " " Somebody 's at my door , Pete . " " I know you 're just saying that . You always get me in some corner and make me stay there . What can I do but hang up if somebody is knocking at your door ? Yet nobody is . " The knocking continues . " Somebody is , Pete . It 's somebody I was expecting . I 'll see you for dinner . " " Aw , good-bye , " Pete says , and hangs up . Charles goes to the front door and opens it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plus ga change . " " Hi , " he says . " Come in . " " I will come in . I feel like I 'm home now . You 're the only person I know who 's still living in the same place . People I leftp113in poverty have got glass-topped Parsons tables now . It 's all changed so much . " " It 's the same here , all right . " " How about family problems ? Oh , well , I should n't rush into that . " She hands him her coat . A black , long coat . She is wearing a Wonder Woman T-shirt and black corduroy jeans and work boots . A knee is torn out of her jeans . The work boots have white paint on them . Why did he wash his hair ? He could have washed it for work when she left . " Would you like a drink or some coffee or tea ? " " You do n't have anything to eat , do you ? " " Cheese , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some cheese ? " " Sure . " He leaves her standing in his living room and goes into the kitchen . She follows him out . " I 've become a vegetarian , and I feel so much better . When I ate meat a week ago , just to try it again , I actually stank afterwards . I could smell myself . " " There 's Muenster and Swiss , " he says . " Some of both ? " " That would be good , " she says . The phone rings . Charles picks it up . " Hell , " Pete says . " That was nuts of me to say there was nobody at your door . I 'm sure there was , and I called back to say that it was just my nuttiness . " " That 's okay , Pete . It was a friend of mine from a couple of years ago , just back from California . I was getting her something to eat . " " I 'd really be a fool if I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought the knock and the food was imaginary , all to brush me off . " Charles hands the phone to Pamela Smith . " Please say hello to my stepfather , " Charles says . Pamela Smith looks taken aback , holds the phone to her ear as if expecting an explosion , then says a tentative , " Hello . " " Why , hello , " Pete says . " Charles says that you 're here from California . " " Yes . I just got back . "  |p114Charles  takes the phone away from her . She looks even more surprised . " I 'll see you on Saturday , Pete . " " Hell , " Pete says . " Down with the phone and off with the pants . " " Oh my God , " Charles says , and hangs up . " It 's a long story , " Charles says to Pamela Smith . " To make a long story short , he gets his feelings hurt very easily , and he thought I was hanging up on him before when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wow , " Pamela Smith says . " That 's sad . " " He 's a sad case . I try to be nice to him , but it 's just not in me . " " He might feel better in general if he cleaned out his system . Saunas and a fresh vegetable regime . " " He 's stuck in his rut . He 'll never get out of it . My mother is nuts , and he spends all his time coping with that and getting slowly crazier himself . " " Have they tried Gestalt ? " " No . She wo n't go out of the house . " " Wow , " Pamela Smith says . " Even if she stayed in . . . she might try eating more fruits and vegetables and so forth . " Charles puts the cheese and some crackers on a plate , turns on the water to make coffee . He motions her to the kitchen table . " So things are pretty much the same here , " he says . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , too . I feel a whole lot better , but things are otherwise the same . I 've got to get a job . I do n't know . Anything beats canning cauliflower in Mendocino . I mean , I just do n't want to can at all any more . " " What else were you doing out there ? " Charles asks . " For a while I was living with this creep . He played the jew's-harp and had an imitation of Elton John doing Benny and the Jets . ' It really got to me after a while . It was always raining in Mendocino , and I 'd go home and he 'd be on the bed , naked , twanging the jew's-harp , going Benny , Benny , Benny aaaaaand the Jets .. : Charles laughs.  | " I sort of had a thing with a woman out there , who turned me on to curried rice . She was older than me . Forty . Except around the eyes , she looked twenty . She had an amazing body . She fasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . She was a silversmith . " Pamela Smith holds out her hand . There is a silver ring on her middle finger . " That 's very nice , " Charles says . " For a while I thought I 'd be staying with her . She was going to teach me how to be a silversmith , get me out of that factory . She had a daughter . It was a weird scene . " Charles nods . He is sure it was . He does not want to hear . " The daughter thought Dylan was coming for her . She hadsubstantial proof from the last two records . She played them allthe time . I was glad to get out to go to the factory some days . " " Is everybody crazy out there ? " " No . I think everybody 's pretty relaxed . There are a lot of nice things about California . Her daughter , though , was always looking out the window , actually expecting Dylan . Her mother was shooting pictures of her in various stances by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Things were really getting pretty tense when I split . And that 's when I ended up with the guy who did the Elton John imitation . We both needed a place to stay . Marlan  --  that was her name  --  came over one night with her daughter , and she spent the whole night at the window . It was getting sort of weird . " " Do you want coffee ? " Charles asks . " I 'd prefer tea , please . " He goes to the cabinet for cups . The cups are very cold from the cabinet . He rinses them in tepid , then warm water before putting the boiling water in . " Actually , the daughter had a daughter too , but it was with its father . Its father was some hot shit San Francisco stock-broker . " " You mean that this girl was an adult ? " " She was twenty-one . She claimed she screwed Peter Fonda on the kitchen floor in an all-night health food restaurant , but I do n't believe it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she says the same thing happened with Ahmet Ertegun , so I do n't believe it . " Charles nods . " But it 's not all that crazy out there . Burbank is awfully ugly . I do n't know . . . I think about going back , but I would n't want to go back to Mendocino . " " What did you come back East for ? " " Oh , I . . . started to feel I was expanding too quickly  --  that I 'd end up like stretched taffy or something . I came back to compress . " Charles nods . " But it 's not all that crazy out there . And now it seems so unreal to me here . I think I may be going back there . Work some shit job for a little while and go back . " Charles nods . " How 's your job ? " she asks . He shrugs . " Money , " he says . " Do you wear a suit to work ? " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at heart . " " Nobody wears them , " he says . " What kind of people work there ? " " Most of them are older than me . Family people . They 're all sort of numb . They 're what everybody says they are . " " I guess it could be worse . You should see the conditions in the canning factory in Mendocino . " " Yeah , " he says . " I would n't want to work in a canning factory . " " I 'm lucky to have my fingers , " she says . " After a while it 's hard to tell your own fingers from the cauliflower flowerets . " She takes a sip of tea . " One day when Marlan 's daughter was looking out the windowYoko Ono walked by . " Charles nods . " I really do n't have much interesting news . Tell me what 's new with you . " " Nothing . " " Do you ever get away to go skiing ? " " I do n't ski , " Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Nimkis . " Charles nods . " Did you know Nimkis ? Wanda 's husband ? " " I do n't think so . " " Totally forgettable . Cared about nothing but skiing . He taught Wanda to ski on their honeymoon , had skis hung on their living room wall . There was even an old pair of them in back of the toilet . She finally left him for a skiing instructor . God knows , she was expert enough at skiing , but the ski instructordid n't talk about skiing all the time . I do n't know what happened to George . How could I have gotten you confused with George ? He had ski masks in all colors , and he 'd pull them over the lamp shades . It looked like an evil jack o'lantern . I 'm glad she got away from George . I wonder where she is now . . . . " " You knew a lot of people around here , did n't you ? " " I went to school here for four years and worked here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary . Well , you knew me then . You know . " " I should think that would beat the canning factory . " " It did , it did . I had to gouge out the centers of cauliflowers with a knife . It was a wicked thing , and it never got dull . I ca n't imagine what that knife was made of . I was terrified of it . I never worked fast enough . " " So you 're going to go back to Mendocino , huh ? " " I do n't know what to do with myself . I really think I could get interested in that woman if it were n't for her daughter . Besidesbeing crazy , she 's so piggish . She lies on the rug all day , and she eats anything that 's put in front of her , and believe me , she expects regular meals down there . Sonny Bono wrote her a couple of letters . I do n't know how she knew him . " " I heard that Dylan showed up at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dylan ? " " I saw his kids at Malibu . They play with Ryan O'Neal 's kid . " " What 's he doing hanging out with Cher ? Hall-breed . ' Christ . " She puts her plate and cup in the sink . " I ca n't remember what you and I used to talk about , " she says . " Lesbians , " he says.  | " That 's right , " she says . " I was freelancing for that feminist newspaper . Well , I still feel very strongly that lesbianism is a good alternative . Like everything else , it has problems . Having a child , for one . And I have decided to have a child . If you have them after thirty they might be monsters . Not really monsters , but what do you call them when they have those oriental eyes ? " " Mongoloid . " " Of course . Mongoloid . I could n't deal with that . For a while Marlan 's daughter almost freaked me off the idea , but I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent Pamela Smith fifty dollars for an abortion . They got another ten from Sam , and ten from a friend of Sam 's who came over with Sam and saw her crying . Her brother gave her some , and a neighbor in her apartment . And a friend of hers from college who lived twenty-five miles away gave her another fifty . The friend did n't have a car and Charles 's would n't work , so they borrowed Pete 's . When Pete found out about it a week later he gave Charles twenty dollars to give her . Charles explained that it was not his child . Pete took back a ten . " Give her the rest , " Pete said . He and Pamela Smith ate at a cheap steak restaurant with the remaining ten . Pamela Smith dyed her hair after the abortion and lost a lot of weight , as if to make sure it was really gone . It was , although Pamela Smith was very upset all that summer , thinking that she saw infants ' faces in the clouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pamela Smith says . " Would you let me stay on your sofa tonight ? " " Sure . Just let me know when you 're tired . " " Are n't you even going to question me ? " she says . " No . I do n't mind if you sleep here tonight . " " I think I 'd rather , because it 's a very strange scene at the place I 'm staying . " " You can stay here , " he says . " You 've always been so nice to me . " " No I have n't . I used to beg you to shut up about lesbianism . I burned your Sappho book . " " We had a good talk once , did n't we , about Kate Millett ? "  | " You wrote me a letter about Kate Millett that I did n't answer . " " I met her . She 's a brilliant woman . " " Maybe she is . I do n't know . " " Are n't you interested to read Sexual Politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better books . Would you be interested in reading any feminist writing ? " " Yeah . Send me something . " " How come you 're interested in feminists , but not Kate Millett ? " " Hell , I was just being polite . I 'll never read anything you send me . " " I really should n't sleep on your sofa . But it 's an awfully weird scene . " " If you 're mad at me you can go to bed and then we wo n't have to continue this conversation . I 'm pretty tired , and I 'm going to bed myself . " " What I like about you is that you 're straightforward . Many men are not straightforward . I think that in business they have to compete , to at least appear very receptive and open , and when they 're relaxing with women  --  that 's what they think women are for  --  they assert their true self , which is generally not straightforward . " " Good night , Pamela , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " May I make more tea before I go to bed ? " " Sure . I 'll put the stuff on the sofa . Good night . " " In your own way , you are really very nice . " He looks at her . Her Wonder Woman T-shirt ripples across her chest . She has gained weight since the abortion . Her hair has grown out . Medium-long , brown hair . Laura told him that medium could be medium-long or medium-short . She confused everything . He used to look at women and think they had medium-length hair . She did more than confuse him , she showed him that nothing was definite  --  even hair length . He thought that her head must reel with the complexities of everything . " When you say afternoon , " she said , " do you meanp120early afternoon or late afternoon ? " " What 's two-thirty ? " he asked . He accepted her answer for everything . " Mid-afternoon , " she said . He felt that he really needed his apprenticeship . He felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuff . " Is there some woman you 're in love with ? " Pamela Smith asks . " Yes , " he says . " But she 's married . " " Marriage is dying . We keep trying to cast the ashes of thedead institution away , but the wind blows them back in ourfaces . We will scatter that traditionalism to the winds . " " She 'll never divorce her husband , " Charles says . " So you 're lovers then . " " I never see her . Since she went back to her husband . " " Marriage is a retreat . It 's wild animals in the rocks that curltogether for protection . The wind will blow the ashes away . " " Will the ashes blow away tomorrow ? " he says . " I 'd like tosee her tomorrow . " " If I could bring her to you , I would . I think you 're a very nice person . " " Call her and tell her I 've tried to commit suicide . " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be sisterhoodfounded upon deceit . " " She 's not your goddamned sister . She 's a housewife in an A-frame across town . " " We 're united .

" I 'll get the blankets . "  |p121He  calls in sick . It 's true that he has a sore throat , but he 's well enough to go to work . He just ca n't face it . Reports . Betty . Lunch alone . " What have you got ? " The blind man there every day to remind him that , at the close of the day , he has nothing . It adds insult to injury to have to answer , " A peanutbuttercup . " Pamela Smith left in the morning , deciding to borrow money from her brother and go back to California to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fixed for her . He went out and bought eggs , cheese , English muffins , raspberry jam , and sausage . She did n't eat the sausage , but he did and it tasted good . She told him not to go out , but he said that he wanted to . It was true ; he did want to . He wanted her to exclaim again how nice he was . It would give him courage to call Laura . " You 're a bully ! " a girl in the sixth grade had once shouted to Charles as he ran by , nearly knockingher over , and he had been so delighted he almost stopped running and started strutting . " You eat all that meat and you get sluggish , and when you 're sluggish you 're depressed . Try eating crisp celery in the morning and only fruits until night , when you can have soup or fish . I know you 'll feel better . "  |p122She  washed the Wonder Woman T-shirt before going to bed . She ate breakfast with a towel around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry . He noticed a mole above her right breast , one that he did n't remember . He tried to remember touching her . He could n't . But lie did remember what she looked like naked , and there was no mole . It must be a melanoma . Inoperable , of course . And if they operate , the cancermay have spread through the lymphatic system or through the blood . Persistent stuff . Laura probably thinks he is too persistent  --  he is a cancer . A cancer on the Presidency . An inoperablemelanoma on the Presidency that occurred , strangely enough , through exposure to darkness . If only he could think of stylish political talk in her presence . Then maybe she would love him . Although she was never very concerned with politics . And he can never think of anything to say ; he just talks about how much he loves her . Could n't they have been like a NormanRockwell family if they had met years ago , if they had been adults in the forties ? There would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chubby baby on Grandpa 's knee ( his father  --  not Pete ) and they would all be seated at the birthday party of his delighted son , Grandma carryingin a strawberry shortcake , the dog running to greet her , everybody slightly overweight and rosy . A white tablecloth , drapes to the floor , an unwrapped present , a bowl of vegetables on the table . Peanut-butter cups . The A-frame . Bob White 's son throwing a brick through a window . He walks the two miles to the park . It is a cold , sunny day . He has heard that hippies bury grass in this park , that if it ever burned , the firemen would be too stoned to fight it . Hardly anyone is in the park . He sees no hippies , suspicious or otherwise . The park has old wooden swings and a dented slide . The park Laura takes Rebecca to in the spring has orange plastic swings and large metal turtles to climb on . Rebecca will not eat turtle soup . She cries because she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain this  --  has been gouged out of this particular turtle to make turtle soup . He went to the park last spring , because he knew Laura was taking Rebecca there , and sat on a bench and watched them . He wanted to rush up top123Rebecca and say warm , witty things to her that would charm her , but he had a very lazy floating feeling sitting on the bench and did n't want to change it by moving , so he only sat there , very still , watching them . Laura gave Rebecca a hand-up on the jungle gym ( Sam , slapping his mother 's hand . . . ) , sat on a bench to smoke a Chesterfield . When he first knew her  --  no , when he first became her lover  --  he got out of bed one night and rummaged through the ashtray to find out what kind of cigarettes she smoked , hoping they would be low in tar and nicotine . He shuddered when he lifted out the Chesterfield . He went back to bed and imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lungs . In the morning , he begged her to have a chest X ray . When the Popsicle truck came , he wanted to buy one for Laura ; the most expensive kind  --  vanilla ice cream in a sugar cone with chocolate and nuts and a cherry frozen on top . Then he would take her to the stone fountain for a drink of water . The next time he went to the park the stone fountain with the two steps had been taken out and there was a red plastic fountain shaped like a boomerang . Charles is wearing a tweed coat that makes him feel like an old man . Other people his age wear ski jackets , navy-blue ski jackets that have no weight but that are stuffed with miraculouslywarm fabric , tied on the inside with secret drawstrings , buttoned and zipped on the outside . You can carry Kleenex on your bicep in those jackets . There is a three-inch zipper , just big enough to pull down and stuff a tissue in . He has examined the jackets , decided that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , he can become an old man in the coat , a powerful Yeatsian old man . She read Yeats to him . Swans , hills , valleys , islands . She read him Pound 's parodyof Yeats , and he wanted to kill Pound . Dead , she said . He disliked Pound so much that she told stories , trying to make him like Pound . It became important to her that he like Pound , but he could not stand the man . He could n't laugh with her at Pound 's rants about usury , and ABC of Reading seemed to him pompous . " But it 's so funny , " she said . When it all failed , she told him about Pound being shut in a cage . Nowp124he pities Pound . Does not like him a bit , but pities him . She has made him feel so many ways . Now he feels a way about Ezra Pound and has no one to discuss it with . There is an old man in the park who looks like Pound . Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and walks with slow steps in highly polished brown shoes . He is the only other stroller in the park . Charles suspects that when the old man 's hand goes in his pocket it is for a peanut or a bit of bread . The old man blows his nose loudly , like a goose , honking . He stuffs the handkerchief in an inside pocket as he passes Charles . Charles turns down a path that takes him to the main section of the park . There are graffiti on the benches . There are no drinking fountains . A dolphin that gurgles water in the summerhas its mouth open to the cold wind . It looks , now , like a terrified caught fish . He never liked to fish . Susan did . She was too small to really fish , but she liked to watch , to jerk her arm as though it held a fishing pole . His father would take Susan fishing with him , and Charles would stay home with his mother . Some Saturdays she baked a cake ( that dessert ... ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cake instead of merely turning the plate until she laughed at him and showed him how easy it was to spin the plate . So he made cakes while Susan fished . Liberated children  --  Charles liberated out of revulsion at seeing fish twitch , Susan liberated because she loved to jerk her arm . She also did it in dancing . She 'd stand on the floor , feet shuffling to a record , right arm flapping like a cowboy with a lasso . They said she would be a conductor . Conductress . Liberation . He hopes Pamela Smith does not waste her money on books . It is too cold to think intelligently in the park ( this is , after all , what he has taken the day off to do ) , and tea might soothe his throat , so he walks in the direction of the hill , below which lies a street with a coffee shop . It is next to a bakery he used to go to with Laura , one that stayed open very late . They would get there just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two A.M. The old Italian woman who worked there ( guarded by two German shepherds and one Madonna ) would make motions  --  what looked like slapping  --  with her fingers ,  |p125lightly  touching the tops of the pastries . She would give one pastry to each dog and , if she was in a good mood , one to Laura and Charles before they even gave their order for half a dozen . His throat constricts , not so much from pain as from remembering . Old ladies always thought they were a sweet young couple . You could tell . He passes a bench that a young woman is sitting on , a little boy in her lap , face turned toward her to protect himself from the wind , a little girl pushing a noisy toy in front of her . It is a clear plastic cylinder with marblesinside . Charles stops to say hello . The young woman is very pleasant . They talk about the snow that is expected , and how hard it is to believe that this park is full of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jeans and boots . Long ( medium long ) blond hair , a full mouth . Her name is Sandra . She does not give a last name , the way women in whorehouses , or waitresses , automatically state only their first name . He tells her his full name , as he would do with a new business acquaintance ( " in business they have to appear very receptive and open . . . " ) . There is nothing left to say . He pretendsto be amused by the little girl at play , asks her name . It is We-Chi , or something that sounds like that . The woman is obviouslyan American , the child too . " It means spirit rising from the great lagoon , ' " the woman says . She smiles . She has very white teeth . He says that the name is very pretty ( Laura . . . ) , thinking she is crazy . " His name is Mecca , " the woman says , patting the blue bundle curved against her . Charles leans forward a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sleeping . Charles nods , backs up a step to leave , and stumbles on We-Chi 's rolling toy . He recovers himself , smiling foolishly , like the comedian deliberately flubbing an exit for laughs . If he had a hat , he could tip it , then trip again and fall on his face . " Good-bye , " he says , and walks away . He has done a lot of walking and is getting tired . Good . If he gets tired , he wo n't have to think . Thinking this , he descends the hill . The sky is gray ; it looks as though there will be no more sun before darkness . He sings a few words of " Mama You Been On My Mind " to himself as he walks down the hill and jumps over the stone border to the sidewalk . With his sore throat , he sounds veryp126much like Rod Stewart . Tomorrow the sore throat may be worse , and he will have to take another day off from work . What a shame . Laura will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch with him , and will be told that he is home sick . He will open his door and she will be there . She will simply be standing there , suffused in the aroma of chicken soup . Get this one down for posterity , Norman Rockwell . Sam 's dog , who often visited my house , is dead ; otherwise she could run yapping to another man 's wife , who has come to bring me chicken soup . Maybe Edward Hopper ? Or a cartoon ? He sits at the counter next to an old woman who smells of mint . Her hair rolls away from her face in even waves . A shoppingbag is wedged between her feet . There is a dirty white towel over whatever is in the shopping bag . The woman is drinking black coffee , into which she empties three packs of " Sweet ' n Low . " She is humming " Swing Low , Sweet Chariot . " Charles orders tea with lemon . A priest comes in and greets the old woman enthusiastically . She moves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she draws out her shoppingbag . Something moves under the towel : a cat . A striped cat . " Say I love you , ' " the woman says , dangling the cat in front of the priest . The priest laughs merrily . He 'd do well in a Santa Claus audition , except that his eyes look mad  --  too many years squeezed in that collar . He orders a second cup of tea . The waitress says that he can use the same tea bag if he wants , but she will have to charge him twenty cents for water all the same . He says that 's fine  --  and as he is sipping , the woman from the park comes in . She is carrying her son , who is still asleep . Or maybe he is dead . He always has fantasies of disaster . Squirrels crossingthe street end up writhing and bloody in his mind , even if they make it safely across ; sleeping people in public places are always dead ; a knock on the door means machine-gun fire when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very upset , " the woman says . What did she say her name was ? Betty . . . but last name what ? Must remember to ask Betty her last name . Thisp127woman 's name is something ordinary . Anne ? Jane ? Sandra ! He says it out loud , victoriously . " You had the right idea . It 's cold today . It will snow . " " Is your little boy okay ? " he says . " Yes . He 's had shots . For going abroad . They make him conk out . They do n't bother you at all , do they , We-Chi ? " The little girl shakes her head . Her mother puts her on a stool beside Charles , unzips her jacket . " Do you want hot chocolate ? " she asks . The little girl does . " Where are you going ? " Charles asks . The Paris McDonald 's .. . " Turkey , " the woman says . " My husband is working there . " " Do you remember Daddy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl does not . " She 's just saying that . You get cranky in the afternoon , do n't you , We-Chi ? " " Is your husband Turkish ? " Charles asks . The children are so blond .. . " Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , " the woman sighs . She orders one hot chocolate with whipped cream , one black coffee . There is a ring with a large sapphire on her left hand . Her hands look old , but the woman looks no older than thirty . The little girl spins around on the stool to look at the cat sitting on the table , lickingits paws . The waitress looks as if she would n't say anything if someone brought an elephant in . Glassy-eyed , she shuffles over to the table to get the priest 's order . " Sure the slaw is made with mayo , " Charles hears her say . " I want vegetable soup , " the little girl says as the waitress lowers the cup in front of her . " You 're having that for supper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . " The little girl turns away from the counter to look at the cat . The priest waves to her and she smiles shyly and swivels to face the counter again . " Are you a student ? " the woman asks . " No . I 'm playing hooky from my job . "  | " I played hooky all through college , " the woman says . " I flunked out . Then I got married . " " What were you studying ? " Charles asks . " Math . After two years , when we get back from Turkey , I 'm going back . " " Do you want to teach math ? " " No . I just like getting lost in calculations . I actually enjoy balancing my checkbook . " " I read somewhere that they were using calculators in elementaryschool instead of teaching arithmetic , " Charles says . " That 's bright , " the woman says . " My sister 's got a kid in school down south and there are pictures in his textbook of black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Educators are very bright . " Watermelon . Spring . In the park with Laura . " When you get done serving all the kids , take one of those ice cream cones to the woman on the bench and another one for her little girl , " Charles had said , handing the ice cream man five dollars . " The bright people are always in control , " the woman says . " They 're so bright that they sent my husband to Turkey , when he did n't know as much as the man already there that they sent back here to work in Wisconsin . " " How long has he been gone ? " " Five months . I have trouble remembering his face . I 've got a friend whose husband died two years ago , and she says she has no idea at all what he looked like . He just looks like the picture on the piano . She says the picture was actually a consolation . It was taken when he graduated from college , so it was about ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's her hus-band . " Charles squirms . " Here 's my husband , " the woman says , holding open the picturefolder in her wallet . Her husband is a blond-haired , ordinary-lookingman , tie knotted at his throat . Charles nods . " I 'm bothering you , " the woman says . " No . You 're not bothering me . " " I went to the park today because if I had stayed in thatp129house another minute I was going to go nuts . My only friend is the woman I was telling you about , and she works all day . I do n't know what to do with nobody to talk to . " " It 's nice to talk to you , " Charles says . " I never thought I was that boring . I do n't know why I do n't have any friends . The only friends I had were his friends , and when he went to Turkey , good-bye friends . I 've had to make arrangements to rent the house , take the kids to the doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's always something to do . The days just get eaten up . " The woman finishes the last of her cold coffee , puts the spoon in the cup . " We have to charge for second cups , " the waitress says when she appears . " That 's all right . We-Chi , do you want another hot choco-late ? " We-Chi shakes her head . She watches the cat , curled on the table , swings her legs against the base of the stool . " Does your wife work ? " Sandra says . " I 'm not married . " " Man , there 's days I 'd like to be single . I might as well not be married , with my husband in Turkey . " We-Chi sneezes , rubs her nose on the back of her hand . " Well , " Charles says . " Soon you 'll see your husband . " " It 's a good thing . I 've forgotten what he looks like . " Charles reaches in his pocket for change to leave a tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you my phone number , " the woman says . " You can come over some night for dinner . Would you do that ? " " Oh , that 's very nice of you . Sure . " He would n't . She writes her name and number on a napkin with a black felt-tip pen . Tiny lines wave off the letters . Her name is Sandra Ribert . " Sandra Ribert , " he says , folding the napkin . " Ribert . Like the bread . " " Ribert , " he repeats . " I 'd ask you for dinner tonight , but I just think that seemsp130too bold , to be honest with you . So if you 'd like to come , call . I 'd like to have you . " " I was going somewhere tonight , " he says . " But I will give you a call . Looks like your son is really sacked out , " he says . The woman nods . Leaving , he trips over a woman 's umbrella . He pays at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It makes him nervous , the way he always felt in high school , showering with everybody else . He always kept his eyes straight ahead , in case any of the boys thought he was looking at them . But they did n't , and that made it doubly hard to keep his eyes straight . Gym . Mr. Franklin was his gym teacher . He called everybody " you sons of bitches , " even when he was addressing them individually . His wife taught girls ' gym . She got pregnant twice and then quit . She called the girls " ladies . " Every month the girls would compete against the boys at volleyball . Mr. Franklin would stand on the girls ' side , blowing his whistle , and his wife would stand in back of the boys , blowinghers . Whistles blew and blew . It made it very exciting . Everybodythought the Franklins were pretty nice . After the secondbaby Mrs. Franklin did n't come back . Franklin was there , still shouting at the " sons of bitches . " Once when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest and fell in the gravel . Everybody rushed to him . Franklin smiled . " I just wanted to see if you sons of bitches really cared about me , " he said . " I 'll remember it at grading time . " Nobody ever got less than a B from Franklin . Even the fat boys and the boy there was something wrong with got Bs . Franklin wrote a recommendationfor Charles when he was applying to the state college . Charles had heard that a recommendation from a gym teacher would be a big help . He did n't know why . But he asked Franklin to write the recommendation and Franklin did it . He handed it to Charles the next gym period . Franklin had spelled the name of the month wrong , and he had commas where there should n't be any . Charles felt very sorry for Franklin and had trouble looking at him after that . Back on the street , Charles decides to climb over the stone wall and go through the park to get home . He was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting crowded byp131this hour , and since he 's tired he might as well get exhausted . Nothing else to do . He crosses the street and pulls himself over the wall , walks up the slippery hill and back into the park . It is getting dark , and there is no one in the park . He jogs across the flat grass and does n't slow down until he is ready to descend the hill at the opposite side of the park . He is panting . He does n't even smoke . He swallows and realizes that his throat is much worse . He swallows again , to retest . It is much worse . He swallows again , fascinated with the soreness of his throat . He has to stick his chin out and swallow very hard to do it . Maybe he is getting the flu . He is sweating , too , but that might just be from jogging . He reaches in his pocket and takes out a tissue . Wait  --  that 's not a tissue . It 's Sandra Ribert 's phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but stops beforerubbing . Who knows . Maybe he will call her some day . She seemed okay . To be honest , she seemed better than Betty . He 's not exactly sure what Betty lacks  --  other than not being Laura  --  but he 's sure he deliberately forgot to get Betty 's phone number . He even feels sorry for Betty . He feels sorry for himself , coming down with the flu . He thinks about something Susan said to him . She said , in effect , that everybody was n't pitiful . Why did he feel sorry for all of them ? Who 's not pitiful ? Sam , selling jackets ? His mother , with her imaginary pains ? Pete , stuck with her ? Pamela Smith is n't pitiful . Sandra Ribert is n't pitiful . But Betty is . The blind man . Is the blind man pitiful ? On general principles , sure . His boss ? Nah  --  he 's not pitiful . He has a summer cottage on Chesapeake Bay and a rich wife , and his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog is pitiful . Only eight years old , and dead . It was such a good dog . Everything excited it : taking a ride in the car , going for a walk , dinner time , bedtime , playtime . Shit . He should have been nicer to the dog . He walks all the way through the park without seeing anyone . Back on the sidewalk it 's crowded , though . He starts jogging , wanting to be home sooner . He 's too winded  --  ca n't do it . He resolves to jog more , to get in shape . He will have the flu , then get better and jog . It gets dark too early in the winter . The streetlights are onp132when he gets to his house . He fishes in his pocket for his key . He has forgotten it . There is a spare in his car . He opens the car door and reaches around under the floor mat . Aha ! The key and twenty-five cents . He lets himself in , walks across the living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note from Sam : " Stopped by . Phone rang when I was here . Somebody named Pauline Reynolds . Will call you later myself .  --  S. " Sam has gone away and left his own key to the house on the drainboard . Charles puts up the thermostat before he takes off his coat . He rubs his throat , strokes downward , as though his throat might get soothed the same way a cat does . He is sipping his tea at the kitchen table , debating whether to go out to the grocerystore for some food , when the phone rings . " Hello ? " " Hello , Charles ? This is Mrs. Reynolds . " " Yes , " he says . He forgot to call Susan . Elise is dead . Mrs. Reynolds is going to send hired killers after him . " I have called to set your mind at rest . I knew you must be worried sick over my little Elise , although you were remarkably and reassuringly calm the other evening . " " Oh . She 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Guess where she is ? " Mrs. Reynolds says . " There with you ? " " No . Guess again . " " At college . " He hates Elise . She bored him to death . This conversation bores him to death . It is better than being gunned to death by hired killers . " No . Try again . " " I give up , Mrs. Reynolds . " " Guess ! You have to guess ! " " New York ? " " No . Not New York . " Christ . Does he have to guess again ? " Guess again , " Mrs. Reynolds says . " Paris ? I do n't know . I have no way of knowing . "  | " I knew you 'd never guess . Elise is in Vail , Colorado . " " That 's good . I knew she 'd be okay . " " I knew it too . Otherwise I would n't have let you placate me so easily on my last phone call to you . I was not drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just flippancy , drunken flippancy , that made me terminate the conversation . " " I did n't think you were drunk , Mrs. Reynolds . " " I 'm not drunk tonight either , but I will have to tell my husbandI was because otherwise he sees no excuse for making long distance calls . " " I see , " Charles says . Charles thinks of a joke his father told him , the first joke he can remember : " I see , ' said the blind man . You do not , ' said the deaf one . " At the time , Charles had not understood . It was years before he could understand jokes . Jokes would be told to him tentatively , his father 's face earnest and worried , knowing he would fail , much the way a doctor must set his face before telling his patient he has an inoperable melanoma , expecting , of course , that the man will never have heard the word " melanoma " before . " What 's she doing in Vail ? " Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did he pay a lot for it and just not want to admit it ? Maybe Sam has been down on his luck ... . " Skiing , " Mrs. Reynolds says . " And here 's another surprise . She 's with your friend . " " My friend ? " Charles says . " Sam McGuire , the lawyer ! " Mrs. Reynolds says . Charles looks at Sam 's note , at the key , at his cup of tea . Christ . " You did n't know , " Mrs. Reynolds says . " I 've called with a surprise . They were going to send you a postcard , I 'm sure , and I spoiled it . " " That 's okay . " Charles says . " I was wondering where Sam was . " " In Vail , Colorado . I 'm so glad she 's met a nice man . A lawyer . Is your friend very nice , Charles ? " A lawyer . Christ . Sam , who sells size thirty-eight regular jackets to men who wear forty-two extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lawyer . He did n't have the money to go to law school . He 'll never have the money to go to law school , or to go skiing in Vail , Colorado . " He 's my best friend , " Charles says . " I 'm sure he 's a nice person if he took Elise skiing . That 's where the President goes , is n't it ? " " Yes . I think so . " " Do you ski , Charles ? " She must be mistaking him for George Nimkis . " No , I do n't . It was very nice of you to call with this good news , Mrs. Reynolds , but I was just preparing my dinner . " " Was n't your wife preparing dinner ? " " She usually does , but tonight I 'm cooking . " " That 's so nice of you . You and your wife must be such nice people . Was it your son who answered the phone earlier ? " " Yes . My son . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting to be a big boy . Well , thanks again for calling . " He will call Susan and give her hell . He is getting pulled in deeper and deeper . If Sam the lawyer impregnates Elise , he will be held accountable . That 's when she 'd run home to her mother . The hired killers , after all . " You 're certainly welcome . And I appreciate you and your wife having Elise there . I think it 's good for teen-agers to be around young couples . My own husband is quite elderly . Elise always jokes that he 's dead ! ' Well , that is n't quite so . Elise said your wife was most gracious . " " She is . Good-bye , Mrs. Reynolds . " " Good-bye , Charles . " Charles picks up the phone again so soon after having hung up that there is no dial tone . He puts it down a few seconds , then picks it up again . He does not have her number . He hangs up and gets his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Charles . How are you ? Is Susan there ? " " Charles . How are you ? I want to thank you for your hospitalityof the other night . It was . Very nice of you to have me sleep over . "  | " I would have given you the bed , but I was in a bad mood . I 'm still in a bad mood . May I speak to Susan ? " " She 's at a sauna right now . " Christ . She 's getting in the spirit of the bourgeoisie . " Tell her to call me , please , when she gets back . " " Nothing wrong  --  not family trouble ? If I may ask . " " Trouble with her bubbleheaded girlfriend . She 's run off and told her parents Sam is with her . The guy who was sleepingat my place the night you were there . " " Ah . And it was n't Sam , you mean . If I understand . " " That 's right . And I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me . " " So . How are things with you otherwise ? " " I think I 'm getting the flu . " " That 's been going around . Sony I ca n't help you . That sounds . Like what a doctor would say . Ha-ha . " " Yeah . Well , tell Susan to call . " " Right , " Mark says . A sauna . Jesus Christ . Elise ought to be in the sauna . Trapped in it for good . Charles dials Sam . Sam gets it on the second ring . " Hello ? " " Hi . Guess where you are tonight . " " What do you mean guess where I am ? " " You think you 're at home , do n't you ? " " Are you drinking ? " " No . I 'm on the rebound from a phone call with Mrs. Reynolds , who has turned up Elise . She 's with you . You 're both in Vail , Colorado . " Sam snorts . " Guess what you are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah . " " I do n't know . What ? " " A lawyer . " " That bitch . I told her I wanted to go to law school . " " No sooner said than done . " " You sound funny still , Charles . You feeling okay ? "  | " Sore throat . " " I came by earlier . Did you see my note ? " " Yeah . You left the key here , too . " " Oh , yeah . I was wondering what happened to that . " " What did you come by for ? " " To see if you 'd already eaten . " " Oh . Have you eaten ? " " Yeah , " Sam says . " Three hot dogs and a can of beans . " " Ugh . " " I do n't have any money . " " Then how were you going to go out to eat ? " " You were going to take me . " " Oh . Well , sorry I missed you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day off from work and wandered around . Went to the park . " " Feed the birds and feel sorry for yourself ? " " No . Forgot to take anything for the birds and felt guilty . " The young in one another 's arms , birds in the trees .. . " They 've been laying people off at work . " " They have ? Are you worried ? " " Sure I 'm worried . Where am I going to find another job . " Sam does n't ask it as a question . " You could find another one . " " You said that with the same enthusiasm you give your mother pep talks with : You can find better things to do than sit in the tub ... ' Charles laughs . " I wish I could sit around in a tub . There 's something comfortingabout that . Just sitting in all that warm water , nothing to do , " Sam says . " It 's very Freudian . " " It 's very comforting . The hell with Freud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll be talking to you . " " Good-bye , " Sam says . Charles decides to take a hot shower . Have one more cup of tea  --  he drinks so much tea he can never sleep  --  and stand  |p137under  the hot water . His legs are tired from so much walking . He 's sweated a lot ; he should wash his hair too . It would be so nice to lie on a raft , to float off the coast of Bermuda , sun shining , wind blowing , drifting . Rum drinks . White shells . Pink flowers . Bicycles . His parents used to take them to the beach in the summer . It was a crowded beach , Popsicle sticks everywhere , stores that sold dirty sweatshirts , fat women in straw hats , the men in matching straw hats , with miniature beer cans attached to the hatband . Auctioneers who kept shouting for everyoneto move in , oriental rug shops , gift shops with naked plastic statues that could be filled with water so they 'd pee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goldfish in the back , and dyed birds ) , the amusement park with puddles of beer and candy apples half eaten . His father always had him by the hand in the amusement park , guiding him around puddles . He went in a house of mirrors with his father . It was a little too hot in there . His father 's laughter was forced . They bumped their heads against the glass . They kept seeing the same people inside over and over . Everybody groped forward with their hands out , got knocked in the head anyway . The kids ran around laughing , as though they knew where they were going . And on the way out , when they finally found their way out , there was a moving belt they had to walk down , which made them teeter out the door . The railing ended just before you came through the plastic fringe curtain to the outside . His mother bought him a bucket and shovel and several different molds at the grocery store to take to the beach . Two kids in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other kids had a starfish mold , a fish mold , a circle , a square , a triangle mold , and a mermaid mold . Charles 's bucket and shovel came with a bucketful of triangle molds in different colors . " Maybe it 's a different manufacturer ? " his mother said . " How should I know ? " He took the label down to his friend 's house . Same manufacturer . He reported back to his mother . " How the hell should I know ? " she said . " Ca n't you use that triangle thing ? What 's wrong with it ? " He thought she was very stupid for getting the worst one in the store . She did n't even check . He told his father that , behind his mother 's back.  | " I 'm sure she did n't check , " his father said . " But she 's awfully busy on grocery day , you know . " Charles hated grocery day . She was always very busy , his sister in the grocery cart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her other hand . Why did he have to hold her hand ? He was n't like the other kids : he did n't pull things off shelves or wander away . And finally she said they were just too much for her and left them with a neighbor when she went shopping . What had they ever done ? It never failed  --  every time she 'd get to the checkout counter she 'd say to him , " Wait with your sister , I 'll be right back , " and run off for another item , and he 'd stand there just knowing that his sister would start crying or that it would get time to unload the cart and pay for the food and he would n't have any money . When he had to start unloading and his mother was n't back he was frantic . He dropped cans , could n't get a grip on the things to lift them out . She always took so long . He used to think she 'd run off and left them , that not only would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd have to get Susan home , and he did n't even know for sure in which direction to walk . He used to watch the route his mother drove to the store very carefully . He memorized a couple of street names . Why could n't she shop at a closer store ? He had asked her that , and she had thrown a fit . " He even criticizes where I shop ! Who does he think he is ? " His father was always in the middle . He picks up the phone . " Hello ? " " Hi . What 's up ? " Susan says . " What 's up ? I 'll tell you what 's up . I 'll tell you what I 'd like to have up  --  my hand against Elise 's bubble head . I 'd like to slug her . What the hell would you bring a crazy girl like that home for ? Why did I have to end up with her ? Have you heard from her ? " " Do n't get excited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is nuts . She called and nearly had me crazy because Elise never showed up after she left here . Tonight she called with the news that she was in Vail , Colorado , with my friend Sam the lawyer . " " Oh no , " Susan says.  | " Where she really is , I would n't know . But I want you to make it your business to find out and to tell her that she 's not to implicate me in this , or the lawyer and I will beat her to a pulp . " " I 'll call Denise . She tells Denise everything . " " She should have told you a little more about where she was going . " " Yeah . I 'm sorry . " " That mother of hers is nuts , Susan . I 've got a nut mother of my own to deal with . And I do n't want to get dragged into this thing . " " She probably is in Colorado . She probably picked up somebodyand went to Colorado with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really is . And I want word to get to her that she should cool it about how nice my wife was to her and how swell Sam the lawyer is . Tell her to make up lies about somebody else . " " I will . " " And call me back and let me know where she is . " " Okay . " " Good-bye . " " Wait . Before you hang up , how 's Mom ? " " I do n't know . I 'm going over there for dinner this week-end . " " She 's cooking again ? " " Of course not . Pete is . " " That 's nice of him . " " Yeah . We 'll all have a great time . Especially if we do n't have to haul her out of the tub at dinner time . " " I know . Well , I 'm sorry about all the trouble Elise caused you , and I 'll call back when I find out something . " " By the way , Susan . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll write you , " she says . " You ca n't tell me ? " " I 'll write you . " " He 's right there ? " " Yes . The sauna was great . I think you would enjoy it . "  |p140This  is just the way Laura would talk to him if he had called  --  a one-way conversation that made no sense . We have enough brushes . Thank you for calling . Charles goes into the bathroom and begins undressing . He has lost weight . He has to remember to start grocery shopping again , lay in some food . Too bad Sam had already eaten . Not that he 's hungry . He piles his clothes on the toilet and steps into the shower . It feels very good . It would be nicer to be stretched out , though , on a raft in Bermuda , dangling his fingers in the cool water . Sharks would slice them off . He has always had problems with reality encroaching on his fantasies . One night when he was dreaming , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to stop dreaming . Charles woke up and sure enough , the electricity had gone off and the alarm would not have rung . The only problem was that it was six A.M. , and he could have slept until seven-thirty . Except that there was no way to set the alarm . So he sat there in bed , reading , for an hour and a half , thinking about the figure who walked into his dream . What to make of the fact that the man looked like Jesus ? The phone is ringing as he steps out of the shower . For a man with no friends , he thinks , the phone certainly rings a lot . " Hello ? " " Charlie ? Hello . Bill . " He did not need to identify himself . Only one person calls Charles " Charlie " : his boss . " Hi , Bill . ' What can I do for you ? " " What can I do for you ? Hear you 're not well . " " I 'll probably be back tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought so , but it 's just a sick feeling . My throat 's pretty sore . " " You ought to drink some whiskey with lemon . Put sugar in if it proves too much for you . Ha ! " " I might take that advice . " " My son goes to Dartmouth with a kid  --  his roommate , actually  --  whohad a sore throat for two months . Finally the doctorsent him to a shrink . The shrink told him his throat wasp141sore because he was deliberately constricting it to stop himself from screaming . " " God . That 's awful . " " Those shrinks are pretty clever fellows , huh ? " For some reason , his boss has been trying to find out for a year if he ever went to a shrink . He has not . " I guess they are . " " But listen , what I called about was this : would you mind if I went through your desk if you 're not there tomorrow ? I know I left my silver pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . " " I do n't remember seeing a silver pen . " " Must have left it there . I think I had my pen with me on Monday because I went over that report with you . Well , I would n't make anything of this , but my boy gave me the pen and he 's going to be coming home and he wants to visit my office . My wife put him up to that , to make me feel good . Anyway , it was a present from him for my birthday , and I thought it should be on the desk . " " Sure , Bill . I do n't care if you look . " " I thought it was only polite to call . It would look bad if you were out sick and I started rummaging through your things . " " You could have looked anyway , Bill . " " Thanks , Charlie . I was sure you 'd be amenable , but wanted to check . " " How 's your son doing at Dartmouth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard , though , and he 's making his mother very unhappy . He writes her the silliest If only ' letters . I do n't know what to say to cheer him up . What can I say ? Harvard would n't have him . " " Well , Dartmouth is a classy place . " Bill loves to hear that things are classy : his son 's college , his shoes . " Sure it 's classy . Try to tell him that . He says it 's cold , and he loves Harvard Square . I was at Harvard Square once . Cars and buses and cops . It was a mess . " " Well , maybe he can get into graduate school there . "  | " That 's what my wife writes him . I tell her , do n't write that . Drop the whole subject . But he 's her son . You know . " " Yeah . " I have a son of my own , I should know . Just ask Mrs. Reynolds if I do n't have a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . I hope it 's not the flu . " " So do I. See you later , Bill . " He goes into the bedroom , puts the towel over the lamp , and gets into bed . He is so tired he 's almost dizzy . he gets up again and sets the alarm , then goes back to bed . The hell with the pajamas . He turns out the light . He is almost asleep when the phone rings . It could n't be Laura . But what if it is ? He gets up and quickly walks to the phone . It is Pamela Smith , calling to thank him for his kindness and to say that he is really a very nice person . She is calling from a motel . She got a ride to California . She thanks him for helping her clear out her thoughts . She thanks him for the breakfast . " At one time I was in love with you , " she says . He does not know what to answer . He realizes , standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells her to have a good trip and to enjoy herself in California . She says that she will make him something out of silver . " I did n't get you out of bed , did I ? " she says . He says she did n't . It 's the truth ; Laura did.  |p143He  stops on the way to work to get gas . It is a self-service station . On the gas pump is a piece of cardboard : " See cashier for transaction settlement . " Why not " Pay cashier " ? He is in a bad mood . He was not going to go to work at all , except that he began to feel much sicker and thought that if he got out of the house he might not think about it . In the house , he had thought about weeping in bed , calling Sam at work to tell him to come right over . He had even thought of calling his mother . That 's when he decided it would be best if he went to work . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , going through his desk . " Thank God I called you ! " Bill said , shooting up , as though he 'd been caught doing something terrible anyway . " If I had n't called , imagine what you would have thought if you 'd come in and found me with my hand in the till ! " " Find your pen ? " " I just got here , " Bill says . " Try the drawer on the right , " Charles says . " How are you feeling , Charlie ? Try my home remedy ? " " Did n't have any whiskey . I 'll get some on the way home . " " You do n't look good , " Bill says . " I feel awfully queasy . "  | " What are you doing here ? " " I just did n't feel like lying around the house . " " Yeah . It must be rough when you 're sick , not having a wife to take care of you . " " Yeah . So I figured I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . " " I will . " Charles sits in a chair against the wall , waiting for Bill to finish . " Sometimes having a wife can present problems , too . Last night she got herself into a state about my boy not being acceptedat Harvard . A very paranoid thing about how they would have taken him if he 'd been black . I spent an hour calmingher down . Her sister married a colored fellow ten years ago , and you should have heard her then . I told her  --  you do n't have to see your sister . What does it matter to you ? She has n't seen her sister in ten years . " " There 's too much emphasis put on what college you go to , " Charles says . " That 's what I tell her . And Dartmouth is n't the small time . She cries because he 's told her it 's very cold there . She thinks he 's suffering in the cold . She talks about him like he 's a stray cat or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she starts feeling better about it . " Bill stands up . " I ca n't find it . Thanks for letting me look . If you see it around , let me know . " " A silver pen ? " " A narrow Cross number . My wife gave it to my son to give me for my birthday . You know . " Charles looks at the paperwork he has to do . He closes his door and takes out his cassette and earphones and puts on " john Wesley Harding . " He works while he listens . When the tape has finished he clicks it off and stands up and stretches . His head is hot . He walks down the hallway to the library and stands looking at it . He goes in and asks for something he does n't need  --  a financial report from 1970 . The new librarian ( he thinks , sadly , that she 's not so new any more ) writes the information down on a slip of paper and goes into the stacks to get it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , pinning her against the shelves . He shakes his head , smiling . Imagine Bill 's reaction : " Why , I just left his office and he was fine . He 'd been sick , you know . . . . " Imagine the librarian'sreaction . Imagine even thinking of doing such a thing . When he gets the report he thanks the librarian and goes back to his office and gets four aspirin , goes to the drinking fountain and takes them , one at a time , tipping his head back to swalloweach time . He reminds himself of a bobbing bird toy he had when he was young . The birds would dip interminably over a glass of water . One night he felt sorry for them because they were n't getting any rest and poured the glass of water on the floor and attached the birds to the empty glass . He denied doing it . Not much was made of it . His mother showed his fatherthe wet spot in the rug , his father shrugged and filled the glass again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's going to meet Laura at school . He even drives to the school and circles the block , but of course Rebecca goes to school a full day now , and Laura wo n't be there for her until three . He could go back then . Except that he does n't want to be pushy . Of course she would be polite . And beautiful . But she would think it was in bad taste . Maybe she 'll call . Maybe he will drive over around three . Three o'clock comes and goes , and he is still working . At three-thirty Betty comes in for the typing and asks how he 's feeling . He is embarrassed , thinking , with his fever , that she knows he deliberately forgot to ask her number . Renounced . The villain . " Okay , " he says . " Do you need aspirin or anything ? " " No thanks , " he says . If only she would leave him alone and not make him feel guiltier . " Okay , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get these back to you in the morning . Is that soon enough ? " " Certainly , " he says . She leaves . He looks up only briefly , when she is almost out the door . The black boots are back . She has on a red miniskirt and a white sweater . She slumps . He should call her , put a lit/tle romance in her life , tell her he loves her , many her . He still does n't know her last name . Leaving work early ( four twenty-five ) , he sees Sid from his floor in the elevator . " Sid , do you know Betty 's last name ? Betty in the typing pool ? " " I ca n't say that I do . " A curious look from Sid . Sid knows . Everything . Both sides of it . That Betty wants him to call , that he is going to call . Well , not without her name or number he is n't . He could call Laura and ask . That would be loutish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do to him . And Sam would n't mind . Would Laura ? He remembers , finally , to go grocery shopping . There is nothing in the entire store he wants to eat . He buys two frozen pizzas , some soup , some salami and cheese , a roast beef , and a can of lima beans . He goes to the dairy counter and gets another kind of cheese and a half gallon of milk . A hippie is standing at the far end , a half gallon of milk opened and being poured into his mouth . What if he 's caught ? The hippie raises his milk carton in salute . Charles waves back . He leaves immediately , in case a store official thinks he knows the hippie . Charles always has a moment of apprehension at the checkout counter , even though he has money . He checks his wallet several times while he 's still in the store . Other shoppers probably feel sorry for him , having to economize , poor fellow , but that 's all right . That 's better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the money . He leaves the store and drives home . Sam 's car is out front . Sam is in the shower . He is doing his " singing in the tub " song , but he is quieter than usual . Usually he can hear Sam kicking ( Sam has confessed to this ) , but the legs will not break tonight . Figuring that Sam has n't eaten , he unwraps the roast and puts it in a pan in the oven . He opens the can of lima beans and dumps them in a pan . He takes a piece of salami out of the white paper it is wrapped in and rolls it into a little tube , bites into it . It 's very strong . Too strong . He finishes it anyway , goes into the living room and turns the thermostat up , sits down with his coat still on . There is a postcard from Pamela Smith : " Thep147Clocks : Walter Tandy Murch , American 1907-1967 . " The message : " Thank you again for being so nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will try to call . P.S. " It takes him a while to realize that there was never an additional message she left off ; they are her initials . In fact , it takes that so long to register that he also goes into the bedroom and looks for the thermometer . He ca n't find it . He goes back to the living room and looks at the rest of the mail . Kittens are apparently no longer being thrown out in trash cans : there is nothing from the HumaneSociety . There is a notice that he should make a dentist appointment . There is also a note from Pete : " Mommy ( crossed out ) Clara suggested I send a note to remind you of your dinner invitation this Sat . We will be eating around seven , unless anything goes wrong with the chicken . I 'm going to stuff it . I hope there are no hard feelings . Called the other night , but the line was busy . Clara has been working a nice needlepoint footrest of a poddle that she thinks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be sure to ask to see it . So far , the baths are at a minimum . I really enjoyed that drink you and Susan had with me . Maybe we can do it again sometime . I 'll see you Sat . Clara suggested that I write . I 'll show her the envelopenow . " " Hi , " Charles says to Sam . " To dispense with formalities , I 'm out of a job . " " What ? When did you find out ? " " Five o'clock . I was going to work until eight tonight , when they came around and told me that would n't be necessary . " " Oh , no . You said you were selling a lot of jackets . " " I do n't know . They were very vague . They do n't even do you the favor of saying one specific thing that can stick in your mind for you to brood over . " " What are you going to do ? " " Collect unemployment as long as I can . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stores ? " " I did n't ask . They actually sent two of them around , probably in case I decided to take one of them on . They were both big . " " Those bastards . "  | " I looked around me at the rows of jackets , and I just could n't do anything but nod . I guess I 'm glad to be out of there . At least for a while I can collect unemployment . " " How much will that give you ? " " I 'm not sure yet . " " That 's awful , Sam . " " Now that I 'm out of work I wo n't have to pay back the collegeloan . Maybe I 'll actually have it easier . " " It 's a rotten way to have it easier . " " I do n't know . What did I do with the money anyway ? I just realized going home that I do n't go out on dates any more . I do n't do anything any more . " " You sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do stuff , but he does . He 's always doing stuff for your mother . I used to do stuff for my dog . Now she 's dead . " " Do n't start feeling bad about the dog . Why do n't you get yourself another dog ? You 'd have time to train it . " " Great . Get fired , and it gives you time to swat a dog 's ass when it shits in the house . " " You get sarcastic every time I tell you to get another dog . " " I liked the dog I had . " " Go on , get another dog . " " Get another girl friend . " " Okay , " Charles says . " Touche . " Sam slumps in the chair . " I 've got a roast beef in the oven . Maybe we ought to go out and get a bottle of wine and celebrate : your loss of a job , my loss of Laura . " " Maybe we should get a bottle of whiskey , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , " Charles says . " Want to go get some wine ? " " Yeah , I guess so . I have n't had a decent dinner for so long I ca n't remember . " " Your car or mine ? " Charles asks . " Mine 's okay , " Sam says . He gets up , shakes his head . " I do n't think this is registering yet . I just realized that tomorrow I wo n't have anywhere to go . " They walk out the front door . The door on the passenger'sp149side is frozen shut ; Sam has to push it open from the inside . The upholstery on the front seats is ripped , and the rug has pulled away from the door and curled up on both sides . There is a crack across the windshield that begins in the middle and takes a ninety-degree turn across Charles 's line of vision . A truck threw a rock into the window . Sam 's insurance did n't cover it . Charles thinks about Pamela Smith talking about marriageas ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been a poet . She did write poetry , in college , and then again for the feminist newspaper she wrote for . But that was ugly poetry , poetry about slippery tongues and pendulous breasts . He is glad he did n't sleep with her when she spent the night . " Which one ? " Sam says . " The new one on the avenue ? " " Sure . Whatever 's closest . " " Do you have money , by the way ? I guess it goes without saying that I 'm broke . " " Yeah . I 've got money . " FIe knows he has thirty-some dollars . If he were going into the grocery store he would already have checked his wallet a couple of times , but this is just a liquor store . He has a twenty and a ten for sure . " I actually think I might be doing better temporarily , not having to pay so much money back to that bank for the loan . " " Like I said  --  it 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ' Wait until my father hears about this . " " Do n't tell him . What 's he got to know for ? " " I do n't intend to tell him . " Sam 's father lives thirty miles away . He has an apartment . Sam 's mother lives in their house , which is only fifteen minutes from where Sam lives . Although sometimes she moves into Sam 's father 's apartment . And sometimes , rarely , Sam 's father shows up at the house . There are always suitcases all over . Sam 's father retired , then went back to work ; his mother took a job , then quit , and at last report was thinking about studying to be a beautician . There was a fight about that , and Sam 's father moved out of the house , back to the apartment . They should get rid of the house and live together in the apartment and send Sam to law school . Neither one likes him well enough to do it . Sam is their only child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tells people that she could n't have another child because of a delicate heart . She tells them she has had heart surgery . She even buys a salt substitute for her bad heart . " What do you hear from him lately , anyway ? " Charles asks . " He called to say that my mother was over at his apartment . I never call her  --  I do n't know why he 'd think I should know . " " How long have they been shuttling back and forth ? " " Eight years , I guess . Maybe a little longer . " " What was Christmas like ? " " Awful , as usual . His sister was invited to dinner , and she showed up at the apartment , and nobody was there . She called from the lobby and made a big thing of it  --  how they should tell her where they were living . She showed up late and everybody was crabby and hungry . It took her about twice as long to get there as it should have . She made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept thinking that she should just turn around and go back to her apartment and eat alone . " " That 's all , though ?

And she pretends I 'm still in college and asks how I 'm doing there . I do n't know why they invite her . " " Is she still working ? " " Yeah . It 's her last year . She told her boss she was retiring next December and he said , I 've been in hell so many years I 've gotten used to it . What will I do without you ? ' " " How long has she been there ? " " Forty years . " " Jesus . Imagine typing for forty years . " " I ca n't . My imagination is dead . I do n't even dream any more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests you sit down and ask your dreams why they are eludingyou . You know : you set up two chairs and run back and forth . " " Tried it ? " " Are you kidding ? " Sam double parks in front of the liquor store.  | " Since you 've got the money . . . " Sam says . Charles goes in and buys a bottle of bordeaux . The man behind the cash register has bushy white hair and eyebrows . He always says the same thing : " Should prove drinkable . " Charles gives him the $5.8o and nods . Then the man asks if he wants a bag . He does n't . He walks back to the car . Sam has turned on the radio and " Benny and the Jets " is playing . Charles wonders if that guy in Mendocino is still playing his jew's-harp and singingthat song . He is glad he is not on the West Coast . He is too old for the West Coast . He found his Frisbee in the closet a few weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pamela Smith was over at my house the other night . " " Is that right ? I thought she was in California . " " She came back for some reason . She was working in a canningfactory out there and it freaked her out , so she came back . Then she decided to go back out and not work in a canning factory . " " That girl was nuts . Interesting , though . " " She 's got a friend out there who 's going to teach her to be a silversmith . " Sam shrugs . " Beats selling jackets . " " You do n't think there 's any way you could go to law school , huh ? "  --  Hope. , , " Well , maybe eventually . " " Sure . I 'll marry a rich woman . Actually , even if I had the money , I think my brain has atrophied too much to understand what anybody 's talking about . " " You exaggerate . " " I got a letter from my landlord last week saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to read it twice to get it through my head what was being said to me . " " He probably wrote it that way on purpose . " Sam shrugs . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do if this car falls apart . Hear that ? If it 's the carburetor I 'm okay , but if it 's the engine , I 'm sunk . " Sinking . Bermuda . The sharks . The fountain . " It 's probably the carburetor . " " It 's probably the engine . "  |p152The  car turns into Charles 's block . The people in this neighborhoodgo to bed very early . They are almost all asleep by ten , and some go to bed this early  --  before eight o'clock . Burglars are always breaking in on sleeping couples . " Did you hear if Rod Stewart was dead ? " " No . Why do you think he 's dead ? " " Some clerk in Housewares told me that this morning . " " Not as far as I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door sticks from inside and Sam has to go around and pull on it . That does n't open it . Charles slides across the seat , tearing it more , and gets out Sam 's side . " That 's how it protests its existence . One morning I 'll go out and both doors will be stuck . " They go into the house and Charles looks at the roast . It looks like it might be done . He sticks a fork in it . It might or might not be done . He leaves it in , uncorks the bottle of wine , and turns on the heat under the lima beans . " This is going to be swell , " Sam says . " Yeah . We eat such rotten stuff usually that I 'm surprised we 're still alive . " " What the hell . You could know everything like Adele Davis and still be dead . " " At least she got to take a lot of acid and trip for half a year until she died . " " Who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie drinking milk in the food store ? " Susan says there are n't many drugs around any more . " " Yeah . Things must really be strange on campus now . Havingfraternities and proms and swallowing goldfish again . " " What do you think they do to expand their minds now ? " Charles says . " Get engaged to doctors . I do n't know . " " I wonder if she 'll have a formal wedding . The whole bit . " " That girl I told you about before  --  the one in Housewares . She 's keeping her wedding to five thousand bucks , she told me today . She 's compromising and not having matches and nap-kins . " " That 's sad . "  | " I do n't know . Maybe there 's something to it . It just seems silly to me . " " My sister seems silly to me . " Charles gets napkins and plates out of a cupboard . Sam gets forks and knives . " We do n't need spoons , tlo we ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Shit . This is going to be great , " Sam says . Charles lifts the roast out of the oven , puts it on a plate and carries it to the table . He goes back and gets the pan of lima beans , pours most of the water into the sink , and carries the pan to the table . He goes back and turns off the oven and the burner and gets the wine . He takes the wine to the table , where Sam is sitting , then goes to the kitchen for glasses . " I should have thought of glasses , " Sam says . He brings two thermal mugs ( a gas-station giveaway of many years ago ) and puts one in front of Sam . " Thanks , " Sam says . " Sure , " Charles says . Sam picks up his steak knife and begins to cut the roast . " Thick ? " Sam says . " Yeah . Please . " Sam begins to carve . " It wo n't cut thick , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin pieces and puts them on Charles 's plate . " Thanks , " Charles says . " Lima beans ? " " Please .

Charles says nothing , so Sam fills the thermal mug . he pours some into his thermal mug . " Great wine , " Charles says . " It looks good , " Sam says . He lifts his mug and sips . " It is good . "  |p154Charles  spins the bottle to face him so he can read the label . " What kind of wine is that ? " Sam says . " Bordeaux . " " French wines are expensive now , are n't they ? " " Yeah , " Charles says . " But they 've never been cheap . " " Well , " Sam says . " This is a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Beats Christmas dinner all to hell .

" " I told you before . I do n't have any idea . " " Call tomorrow and find out . " " Stop talking about tomorrow . " " Would you like some coffee ? " " Please . " Charles gets up , taking his plate and Sam 's , and goes to the kitchen . He did not turn off the burner after all . He turns it off . Then he puts it on again  --  silly to turn it off  --  and puts the coffeepot on it . " If you think there 's milk , there is n't , " Charles says .

He puts his fork on the plate with what 's left of the roast . " Thanks for offering , though , " Sam says . " I appreciate it . " " I think you 're nuts not to take me up on it . It 's a big house .

He gets a spoon and puts coffee in the boiling water , stirs , and walks back to the dining room . " I was thinking about my dog , " Sam says . " Do n't think about your dog . You 'll get depressed .

Say something funny . " " One time somebody sent Cary Grant a telegram : How old Cary Grant ? ' Cary Grant wired back , Old Cary Grant fine , how you ? ' " Charles 's father had told him that one .

" It does n't take much to amuse you , " Charles says . " Not when I 'm this loaded it does n't . " Charles realizes , for the first time , that he is also a little drunk . " How 'd we get loaded on a bottle of wine ? " " I never drink any more . I never do anything any more . " " You do too . " " What do I do ? " " How should I know ? You do stuff . " " I do n't do anything , " Sam says sadly . " Let 's go out to a bar , " Charles says . " I do n't want to just sit around here all night . " " Let 's catch the news . See what we can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the news . " " Okay . Let 's go to a bar . " " Your car or mine ? " Charles asks . " Mine is okay . " They put their coats on and leave the house , dishes still on the table . Charles ducks back in to check the burners . They are off . He goes back out the front door . It is very cold , and almost every light on the block is off . Riding along , Charles stares atp160the dark houses with wonder . How can they go to bed so early ? It must be habit , years of training . Got to get up for work , got to go to bed . And they do it . He once asked Laura what time she went to bed , so he could think of her . She would n't tell him . " It would end up depressing you , " she said . She was right ; it would depress him to know . But at least he would know  --  he would n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . He gives the finger to the house he thinks the cripple lives in . They end up at the same bar he went to with Pete . The collegekids are back , though , and it 's crowded and noisy . The bar smells of sweat . There is a clock over the jukebox that shows a beer mug perpetually bubbling . Charles decides to drink a beer . He has more than twenty dollars . He can get good and drunk . In a few minutes a couple gets up to leave , and they sit at a table . The same waiter who took Pete 's order comes to the table . Tonight he is wearing dark green slacks . They look like velvet . There is a big grease stain across the thigh . Janis Joplin says , loudly , " This is a song called Get It While You Can . ' Cause it ai n't gon na be there when you get up . " Do the kids in the bar even know who Janis Joplin is , or do they accept anything that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depressing song . Janis Joplin is dead . Maybe Rod Stewart . " I do n't think Rod Stewart is dead , " Charles says . Sam does n't say anything . He is staring at a girl across the room . Charles orders a pitcher of beer for them . " Hey , hey , get it while you can , " Sam says . " Looks like reading those trash book did n't do you any good , " Charles says . " It did . You do n't see me getting up , do you ? " " Maybe you should go over . Do n't listen to me . I 'm just being witty , " Charles says . " To tell you the truth , I 'd rather have my dog back than that girl , " Sam says . " Forget the dog . Stop talking about her . " The dog , sitting down , rolling over , shaking hands for a beef bone . . . " ' Atta way , Maria ! " a drunk shouts at the speakers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I came for a drink with Pete . "  | " He 's always here . " " He looks like he 's in bad shape . " " I heard that he was a sociology professor . " " You 're kidding . " " That 's what I heard . " Sam turns around and stares at the checked tablecloth . The pitcher of beer is put down in the middle of the table . " Good centerpiece , " Sam says . " Amy Vanderbilt would think so . " " She does n't think shit any more , " Sam says . " Oh , yeah . I forgot . " " That Elise was really a dummy . " " She was n't even very good-looking , " Charles says . " She was n't , " Sam agrees . " I should have kept my fifteen . Then I could contribute to the beer fund . " " I 've got plenty of money . " " That was a subtle hint , in case you 'd forgotten I was broke . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you asked me to come live at your place ? " " Of course not . How drunk do you think I am ? " " I do n't know . I just wanted to check . " " You ought to do it , Sam . I do n't think we 'd get on each other 's nerves . " " I could n't do that . It 's nice of you , though . " " Think about it , " Charles says . " I 'll think about it , " Sam says . " O0000h , Mama , " the drunk shouts . " Maria ! " " He 's no sociology professor , " Charles says . " I 'll ask him , " Sam says . Sam gets up . Charles stares straight ahead , in case there is a fight . He does n't want to get involved . If only Sam had n't gotten up so quickly , he could have dissuadedhim . " He is , " Sam says , sitting down again . " You really asked him ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " Jesus , " Charles says . Charles pours another glass of beer.  | " Then what did you say ? You did n't just ask and then walk away , did you ? " " I said , You 're not giving a graduate course this semester , are you ? ' And he said he was n't . " " What if he had been ? " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " I would have thought of some-thing . " Clever Sam , the drinking fountain handle twisted off .. Sam pours another glass of beer . " I wish I was back in college , " he says . " Yeah , " Charles says . " But I do n't think I 'd want to go to college now , " Sam says . " With these people , I mean . They look just like they 'd go to a prom . " Charles fills his half-empty beer glass . " You want to hear something sad ? " Charles says . " Do I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I read . You know Jacques Cousteau ? " " Sure . You think just because I 'm not in law school I 'm an ignoramus ? " " I think you 're very intelligent . That 's why I wish you could be a lawyer . " " I do n't have any goddamn money . Or motivation . " " Jacques Cousteau had this dolphin he was working with ... " " If the goddamn dolphin died , I do n't want to hear about it . " " It did n't die . The dolphin liked Cousteau and all the attentionhe gave her so much that she always had her head out of the water , and she got sunburned . " Sam laughs . " That 's not depressing , " he says . " I think it is . " " It 's not as depressing as some things I could think of . " " Such as my unrequited love for Laura ? " " I was thinking more selfishly . " " I 'm paying for the beer . Think charitably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " She does like me . She might even love me . She just wo n't leave her husband . " " We 've been through this before . " " Be charitable , goddamn it . I love her . " " Yeah . She was nice . " " I know she was nice . Why did her husband have to meet her before I did ? " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " I do n't know , either . She says she does n't know . " " Maybe you can shame her into leaving him or something . " " I doubt it . " " I do n't know . I never have anything intelligent to say on the subject . " " I just like to talk about her . I 'm a masochist . Susan says I am . Do you think I am ? " " I do n't want to insult you . You 're my best friend . " " You do think so , then ? " " I guess you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know anything . " " Mama Maria , ooh la la , " the man hollers . The waiter brings another pitcher of beer . " You know what you could do for me ? " Charles says . " What ? " Sam says , picking up the pitcher . " You could just drive me past her house . " " What good would that do ? " " I want to see if the lights are off . " " You 'll make yourself miserable . " " Come on , Sam . " " I do n't think it 's a good idea . " " Then we 'll go over to your apartment and get as much of your stuff as we can haul and bring the stuff to my place . " " No , no . I ca n't move in with you . But thanks . " " What 's the real reason you wo n't move in ? " " I just would n't feel right about it . It 's your house . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a lot less than the rent you pay . " " Jesus , I ca n't do that . You mean just move out of my apart-ment ? "  | " Yeah . Then if you find another cheaper place to move , go ahead and move . Meanwhile you 'd be out of there . " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " Anyway , there 's a gas leak in your apartment . " " Everybody who 's got a gas stove has a smell like that . " " That 's because they leak . " " I do n't want to fight with you . " " You 're not able to fight with me . " " I would n't want to anyway . " " Come on , finish this beer with me and we 'll get moving . " " What if you 're just drunk and you wake up in the morning and I 've moved into your house ? " " I asked you at dinner . I was n't drunk at dinner , Sam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ? " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " You could save some money . You could look around and find some better place to live . You 're not going to give them twenty-five bucks more a month for that place that 's poisoning you , are you ? " " Let me finish this beer , " Sam says . " Will you at least drive me past Laura 's ? " " Yeah . It seems maudlin to me , but if that 's what you want . " " Maria Muldaur ! " the man hollers . Charles smiles . If Sam had said no , he was going to have Sam drop him off and drive his own car . He does n't want Laura to look out her window and see his car , though . He does n't want her to think he 's harassing her . She does n't know Sam 's car . Not that she 'll be awake . " Maybe I could move in temporarily , " Sam says . " Until I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise the landlord , " Sam says . " Yeah . Just move out on him . " " It 'll be strange not going home and riding in the elevator , " Sam says . " Apartments are for shit . " " Yeah , " Sam says . Charles pours the last of the beer into his glass . It 's flat . Hep165pours a little salt in . It will make him thirsty during the night , but so what . He stares at the head rising on his beer . " There she goes , " Sam says . The girl that Sam had been staring at earlier is walking out of the bar . She looks about twenty , a tall , blond girl in a navy blue coat . This close , she 's not as pretty . She 's with another girl , a dumpy brunette . The brunette smiles at Charles . He smiles back , reflexively . The smile is too wide ; he 's pretty drunk . They walk out the front door . Charles stares at his fingers . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if playing with the Ouija board . He hangs his hands at his side . He feels the blood go into them . He puts them back on the table . " Are we going ? " Sam says . Charles reaches in his pocket for his wallet , counts out the bills , and leaves them on the table . He folds the check and puts it in his pocket without thinking , shakes his head and takes it out . On the back is written : " Your Waiter " and under that " J.D.  --  Thank you ! " in handwriting very small and pale . They shiver walking to the car , but Charles does n't feel the cold air sobering him up much . He reaches up and smoothes his hand across his forehead . " Do n't drink so much , " Laura used to say . His forehead is numb . Sam fumbles putting the key in the ignition . " If you make me drive over there and then get depressed , I 'm going to be mad , " Sam says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to drive by the place . " " You ever go in her house ? " Sam asks . " No . " " I just wondered what an A-frame was like . What 's the point of them ? " " I never thought about it . " He has never been in her house , but he knows what it 's like inside . The bathroom has white tile on the floor . Plain white . The tub and sink and toilet are all white . The sink in there is always getting stopped up . You 'd think the tub would , since that 's where they wash their hair , but it 's the sink . The white sink , against the left wall . There is white tile halfway up the wall , and gray and yellow flowered paper the rest of the way.  |p166Tiny  flowers . Rebecca 's room is also done in this wallpaper . He has no idea what paper is in her bedroom , because she wo n't discuss it with him . The living room and kitchen are off-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . There is n't very much furniture . There are two comfortable chairs , and there is one uncomfortable chair . The sofa seat is n't wide enough  --  it hits everyone just wrong . She has a blender . There is no umbrellastand . There is an Impressionist painting on Rebecca 's wall : Seurat 's " Une Baignade Asnieres . " " La Greve du Bas Butin a Honfleur " hangs in the living room . No , there is no art in the bathroom . That 's a little tacky , is n't it ? He has bought a print of " Une Baignade Asnieres , " but ca n't find the other . It 's a little depressing , to be honest . It 's so empty , so washed-out . She bakes the gingerbread cookies in a white oven . There is a pale green refrigerator  --  not her choice , but it was on sale , that color only . There is a wood table in the kitchen , and chairs they got at an auction for fifty cents each . He imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve to go to an auction . He would always look like he was bidding when he was n't . He would be forced to pay for and take home everything in the place . Then he 'd be stuck with it . He brightens ; no he would n't . He could call Best Bird Antiques . He is a little drunk . Charles has been silently pointing directions to Sam . " Turn , " he says , pointing right . Sam turns just in time . He seems to be a little drunk also . Charles starts looking for policemen . What if Sam got stopped ? This is n't such a hot idea . They should go home . But he wants to see her house ... . Sam makes another right turn . Not much traffic , even on this street . Charles looks at his watch . It is one in the morning . Work . Impossible . Work . No . " That street , " Charles says . " This is where it is ? " " No . This takes you right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here . It 's nice . " " I was sort of hoping she 'd despise it . " " It 's a nice part of town . I was never out this way . " Charles closes his eyes for a minute . In the back of his head he hears the beginning of " Gim me Shelter . " Was that playingp167in the bar ? He opens his eyes and sees that Sam has put the radio on . " Gim me Shelter " is indeed playing . Charles imagines a dolphin leaping , that music in the background , a water ballet in cartoon style . He would really like to get out of the cold for a while , to stretch out on a beach in the sun . Inoperable melanoma notwithstanding . He points left , and Sam turns . The Rolling Stones are wailing as Sam coasts by Laura 's house . There is a light in the kitchen . A light in the kitchen ! Charles reaches over and grabs Sam 's arm . Sam slows down . " Christ , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh shit , " Charles says . " She 's baking gingerbread cookies . She 's awake . " " Baking cookies ? Are you out of your mind ? It must be one in the morning . " " I know that 's what she 's doing . " Sam turns in a driveway ; coasts past Laura 's house again . " How do you know that light 's in the kitchen if you 've never been in there ? " " She drew me a floor plan once . " " That 's the sickest thing I 've ever heard . " " I asked her to do it . " " I figured . " " Oh , Sam , she 's baking cookies . " " Christ , " Sam says . " She 's a room mother . " " What 's that ? " " They give parties for the elementary school kids on holidays . That kind of stuff . " " We did n't have one of those . " " I know it . " " I did n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know . " Charles closes his eyes . Gingerbread men dance with dolphins . " Why do n't you give her a call tomorrow ? Why do n't you just give it one last chance and find out one way or the other ? " Charles shakes his head . " Do n't tell me it 's pride at this point , " Sam says . " After you sent her four dozen roses you 're acting coy ? "  | " I sent them years ago . I 've gotten coy , as you put it . " " Why do you want to drag this out ? Get an answer . You 'll feel better . " " I do n't want to get no for an answer . " Sam sighs . They are back on the main road , and Sam is headed for Charles 's . " Man , are you going to be suffering tomorrow , " Sam says . Charles puts his feet on the front seat and tips his head forwarduntil it rests on his knees . He closes his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a ridiculous vision . Charles opens his eyes . What does the blind man do when he has a bad dream ? " Did you mean what you said before about moving in ? " " How many times have I got to tell you ? " Charles says . " Okay . I 'm going to do it . But not tonight . I 'm wiped out . I 'll load some stuff over tomorrow . " " I 'll see you then . " Charles prepares to leave , realizes that he is still riding in the car , miles from home . He rides the rest of the way home with his head on his knees , no more disturbing visions . " You want to know something ? " Sam says . " What ? " " When I first came here , you remember in the fifth grade ? You remember how there was that valentine box ? " " Yeah , I remember . The girls decorated the thing . " " This is really awful . I should n't tell you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother bought me a box of valentines . I was addressing them at the kitchen table . My father came in and started picking them up . I was sending them to everybody , you know ? He just about had a breakdown . He sorted out every enveloped addressed to a boy and ripped it up under my nose . He said , A valentine is romantic . What the hell are you sendingvalentines to the boys for ? ' It really made me feel like hell . " Charles frowns . " That 's awful , " he says . " I did n't know he ever pulled that kind of stuff on you . "  | " He was always having tantrums . I guess that was just one more excuse . " They ride in silence to Charles 's house . " See you tomorrow , " Sam says . " Okay . See you , " Charles says . The door opens , and he runs to his front door , reaching in his pocket for his key . He takes it out and opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he leans against the front door as if he 's escaped something terrible . He reminds himself of the frightened heroine , hiding in the closet from the villain . He laughs . He puts the light on and goes into the dining room . The roast is there , in a puddle of blood . He puts on the bathroom light and urinates . He sits in a chair and looks into space . Work . Tomorrow . As he is getting ready for bed , the phone rings . " How 's my boy ? I hate to disturb you at this hour , but I know you just got in because I 've been calling . " " Hi , Pete . " " I 've got to talk low . Can you hear me ? " " Oh , God . What 's the matter now ? " " Nothing . Something good . " " What is it ? " " I 'll bet I know where you 've been , " Pete whispers . " Where ? " Charles asks . " With your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out drinking . " " Oh , " Pete says . " Well . I 've got very good news , but when you come over Saturday you 've got to promise to act sur-prised . " " What is it , Pete ? " " I got it , " Pete whispers . " Got what ? " " The Honda Civic , " Pete whispers . " White one . "  |p170Coming  home from work , Charles sees Sam 's car parked outside . The car looks as though it has a flat tire on one side ; it tilts noticeably to the right . Charles gets out of his car and looks it over . There is no flat tire . The car does tilt noticeably to the right . While he is there , Charles tries to open the door on the passenger 's side . It does n't open . He tries the driver 's side . It does n't open . Charles walks up his front lawn to take this good news to Sam . Sam is in the tub , doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunting , so he must be kicking . The radio is turned to a classical music station . There is a can of V-8 on the table . Charles sits down and begins opening the mail . There is a letter from Susan . Not a letter , it turns out , but a brief note . " I could n't tell you over the phone that Mark swallows to avoid stuttering . Is n't it amazing how well that works ? Found out Elise is in Vail . But by the time you get this she 'll probably be back at school . I 'm sorry she caused you so many problems . I hope Mother is n't . Love , Susan . " " Hiya , " Sam says . " I brought over a few boxes . I 've decided to sell my furniture . I gave away the two black chairs today to people in the building . I might get some money for that crummy sofa . " His mother gave him the sofa when his father got the apartment . His father went out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complains that the original sofa is n't still at the house . " How did it go at work ? " Sam asks . " I got up the nerve to find out Betty 's phone number . " " ' Who 's Betty ? " " A secretary there . She used to pal around with Laura . " " You do n't mean you 're going to get at Laura somehow through her ? " " No . In fact , I 'm so unimpressed with Betty that I left the piece of paper with her number on it out in my car . Which reminds me : you were right . Both doors are stuck . " " You 're kidding me . " " No . I tried them . And there 's something funny about the way that car is balanced . Your shocks must be gone or some-thing . " " What do you mean ? " " It tilts . " " I 'll just prop it up with cinder blocks . " " How are you going to drive it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're in a jovial mood . " " My hangover finally went away . I 've slept on every piece of furniture in your house today . Kept falling asleep . I finally feel okay again . " " That 's good . Want to go out for dinner ? " " Yeah . Where should we go ? " " Some place close . The seafood place . Feel like that ? " " Those old men are depressing . " " We do n't have to sit at the bar . We can get a table . " " I do n't think they 're too clean . " " Where do you want to go , Sam ? " " Delicatessen ? " " Okay . Sure . I want to wash my face first . " " You 're not pissed off that I 'm moving in ? " " No . I 'm glad you took me up on it . You can save some money this way . " " Thanks a lot , " Sam says . " I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do a good imitation of her , " Sam says.  | " Thank you " " I 'm going to go out and see if I can get one of my doors open , " Sam says . Charles takes a swig of the V-8 , goes into the bathroom , and runs the water . Sam 's toothbrush is in the toothbrush holder : a red toothbrush . Even Sam 's toothbrush is falling apart ; the bristles splay outward . Charles fills the sink and leans over , closinghis eyes and putting his face in the water . He puckers his lips and blows a thin stream of bubbles underwater . It would be wonderful to be submerged in water , to wade out , off the coast of Bermuda , until the water slowly covered his head , and then to blow a thin stream of bubbles before bobbing up for air . To arch his back and glide in the water until his body was horizontal , eyes on the blue , blue sky . The idea is so appealing that he runs the water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest underwater before his knees come up . He sits on the toilet watching the water flow into the bathtub . He thinks of his mother , of the time she called him to get her out because she was having terrible stomach cramps , and how he had to go into the bathroom and lift her from under her arms . She was dead weight , and was complaining so much she would n't followorders . He started laughing , because he suddenly thought of her as a big shark , a big , slippery fish that he could just let go of , and it would return to the depths of the ocean . He was laughing so hard , and she was complaining so loudly , that neitherof them heard Pete come in . Charles did n't know he was there until Pete spoke from behind him , and then he was so genuinely surprised that he almost did let go . Pete held a towel in front of her as Charles hauled her out . After it happened about ten more times , though , Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , he did n't even wrestle her into her bathrobe once she was on the bed . Saturday . He has to go over there for dinner Saturday ... . " Frozen , " Sam calls , walking through the house . " Pipes in the kitchen , too . The water running in there ? " " Yeah , " Charles says . " Mind if I come in and fill a pan with hot water so I can pour it on the car lock ? " " Just a minute , " Charles says . He gets up and sits in thep173bathtub . He ran the water too hot , and whistles as he sits down . " Okay , " Charles says . Sam 's cheeks are very pink , and his hair covers his forehead . " Man , is it ever cold out there . I 'll bet this is the coldest night of the year . If I 'd only thought , I could have bought some groceriesso we would n't have to go out . " " Delicatessen 's not far . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat at the seafood place ? That was where you wanted to go , was n't it ? " Sam turns off the water , leans against the sink facing Charles in his bath . His mother used to do that . " If you can wash yourself so good , let 's see you wash , " she 'd say . " Delicatessen 's all right with me , " Charles says . " I 'd just as soon have some oysters , " Sam says . " Why do n't we go ahead and eat at the seafood place ? " " I thought you said the old men depressed you . " " So we can eat at a table . " " I said that to you before . " " Okay . That 's what we 'll do then , " Sam says , leaving the bathroom . Charles sighs . He was all set for hot pastrami and potato salad . He leans back to relax , knocking over a shampoo bottle on the edge of the tub . He retrieves it , leans back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fish , a trout , maybe , fanning his gills in the dark , cold water . A trout is a phallic symbol . He shakes the thought out of his head . " I know too much , " he says out loud . He picks up the soap and makes a lather , drops it back into the soap dish . It slips out . He reaches into the water for it , then realizes that it is his bar of soap , and if he wants to be wasteful , he can be . His mother used to nag him about putting the soap back in the dish . " If you 're so smart you can put the soap back in the dish so the next person who bathes can have more than a chip . " Saturday . Maybe somethingwill happen and he can get out of it . " It 's started to snow , " Sam hollers . " Did you hear me ? " Sam hollers again . " It 's snowing . " " Yeah , " Charles says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I really blew it , " Sam says . " I should have gone out for food . " Charles runs a little hot water into the tub , swirls it around with his foot . He thinks back on his day ; his boss 's son came in to meet him , and he disliked him . He had on an argyle vest and black loafers , and mumbled like Marlon Brando . He had Brando 's gestures , too  --  a wave of the hand to dismiss something ( usually his own statement ) , a turn of the head to look first away , then down . He said very little , and what he did say was so softly spoken that Charles could n't pick up on anything except the wave of the hand and the ironic laugh that followed . He is glad not to have children . He remembers sitting on a stool in his father 's workroom . " You 've heard of screwing , right ? " He is glad he does n't have a child he would have to explainsex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have children ? She seems to want only reports that she can type . He asked her today for her phone number . He said that he intended to call her to invite her to a small party he was giving soon . ' What small party ? He does n't know anybody . At the last minute he chickened out , could n't say the word " date . " Betty looked very hopeful all the same . She wrote the number , very efficiently , on his memo pad , coming around to his side of the desk to do it . Laura would know what her perfume was . A very heavy scent , obviously fake . Everything about Betty is obvious : the clothes she wears betray her bulges , the perfume is meant to draw attention . Today she had on one of the new longer skirts ( he saw this in last week 's Sunday Times : " the new longer skirts , " they were called ) and a pale blue blouse that was n't bad . Except that she had on some ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the black boots . Maybe he could ask her to go puddle jumping . The phone rings . Charles sits up , trying to hear Sam 's end of the conversation . It sounds as though Sam is mumbling . Maybe Sam has left and has been replaced by his boss 's kid . " It was Pete , " Sam hollers . " I told him you were in the tub . He said you do n't have to call back , but he wanted to remind you to act surprised about the Honda Civic . " " Oh , Christ , " Charles says . " You did n't tell me he bought a new car . "  | " It 's not the first thing I 'd think to tell you about . " " He sounds happy as hell , " Sam says . " She 'll ruin it for him . Just give her time , " Charles says . He lifts the stopper and puts it in the soap dish . He lets most of the water drain out before he reaches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush you , but if we 're taking my car ; we 'd better get out there before the lock re-freezes , " Sam says . He is drinking V-8 and listening to the stereo through the headphones . He screams the statement . Charles nods , goes into his bedroom and throws the towel over the lamp . He puts on underwear , goes through his drawer looking for a clean pair of jeans . His clothes are all dirty . He has to go to the laundromat . Maybe on the way to his mother 's . Saturday . He lies on the bed , suddenly tired . He flips the bedspread over him . He looks like a mummy . He closes his eyes . A party he 's giving . My God . Call Audrey and the cripple , ask Fete to stop by ? Have Sam carry around trays of little crackers with bits and pieces of things on top ? His mother and father used to give birthday parties for him . His father would blow up balloons on the bicycle pump and hang them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back yard . When the pin oak died there was nowhere left to string them to , so the crepe paper tapered down to his mother 's clothesline  --  one of those metal things that look like an umbrella blown inside out . That was his last party . After that his father was dead . First the pin oak , then his father . Once he had a chocolate cake shaped like a football . Another time three kids gave him the same present , and he and his fatherrode down to the hospital to donate the other two to a playroom there . His father was pronounced D.O.A. at that hospitalnot long after that . He and his mother went to the hospital in the police car . Inside , Charles wanted very much to think of an excuse to go back to that playroom to see if the toys were still there . His attention kept wandering . His mother kept crying . The toy was called " Mr. Jumping Bunny "  --  a metal bunny that could be wound with a key to jump . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of his all-time favorites was a pair of wooden stilts that he wore to school to march in the Halloween parade , and that he later walked around the eel/lar with , pretending to be his dead father . Once he and his father had a " fencing " duel with the stilts , and his mother had run out into the backyard to stop them . " Those huge pieces of wood ! What if one of you had an accident ? " When Pete first married his mother he used to try to initiate games with Charles , but he never wanted to play because Pete did n't know how to improvise . He played everything straight , and it was a big bore : with badminton rackets he played badminton ( his father had made a game of picking dandelions from the lawn and hitting them as though they were baseballs and the badminton rackets bats ) , with the Monopoly board he played Monopoly , there were no unexpected twists to the card games they played ( his father had asked , " Ever play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns on his side , facing the wall . IIe closes his eyes and tries to remember his father . He ca n't . He gets an image of a black-haired man with a handlebar mustache and blue eyes , the man who was painted on the mug Charles gave him one Father 's Day . He closes his eyes again and tries to picture Pete . IIe sees him perfectly , opens his eyes immediately . He gets up and puts on a pair of dirty pants , a blue shirt , and an old sweater . " Ready to go ? " he asks . Sam looks at him blankly , takes the headphones off . " Ready to go ? " Charles says . " Oh . Sure . Let me get my coat . " They put on their coats ( he will have to take all that stuff out of the closet so Sam will have some place better than the upright ironing board to hang his things on ) . " If you want to bring any of your furniture over here , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , feel free . We could use some tables and things like that . " " Oh . That 's very nice of you , " Sam says , starting the car . " If you 'd like me to , I can bring the coffee table over and the round table . " " Sure . Bring it . I do n't care what the place looks like . " Sam looks hurt . He has said the wrong thing . " It 's nice-looking stuff , anyway . "  |p177Sam  looks less hurt . " I 'll get it tomorrow , " he says . " It 's going to be here when you come home . " Big thrill . Tables will await him . He could , of course , have that little party , and there would be tables to put the hors d'oeuvres on . He and Sam could make the hors d'oeuvres he had at his boss 's house three years ago : crackers with a slice of hard-boiled egg on them , topped with caviar . What a swell time they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to inspect the meter in the cellar  --  a very nice man named Ray Roy . ' When Charles is n't home , he leaves a little piece of paper saying , " Be by end of week . Ray Roy . " Pete takes pride in the fact that no one has been admitted to read the meter since he came to the house . " Why let them down in my cellar ? ' What for ? " It would give Pete and Ray Roy something to talk about , as they nibbled hors d'oeuvres . " What are you smoldering about ? " Sam asks . " I 'm just in a lousy mood . I 'm tired . " " Do a lot of work today ? " " No . I have n't had a lot of work to do for months , for some reason . I asked Betty for her telephone number today , though . " " Going to take her out ? " " I told her I was going to have her over to a party . " " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make some friends . " " Oh , " Sam says . " I do n't get it . " " I did n't want to ask her for a date on the spot , but I 'd asked her for her number , and I had to say something . " " Yeah . I was always giving my dog orders or calling her when I did n't need her . I was always retracting my statements to the dog . She got to know what never mind ' meant . " " Why do n't you get yourself another dog ? Bring it to my place . I would n't mind have a dog around . " " It depresses me that I have time to train it , that I could actuallyjust sit around all day teaching it stuff . " " Why should that depress you ? Get the dog and teach it stuff . " " Nah . There 's too much stuff to teach them . It 's too much effort . "  | " Get one already trained . " " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charles says . " Maybe this will get me out of dinner tomorrow . " " It 's tomorrow , huh ? " " You 're lucky your parents only expect you to show up on Christmas . " " I go over there more than that . " " Yeah , but they only expect you on Christmas . " " That 's true . " " And at least you do n't have to fish them out of the tub and watch them medicate themselves the whole time you 're there . " " On Christmas I got to sit at a card table my father had put up in the living room that he was working a puzzle on top of . I had to pretend to be interested in fitting a pizza puzzle to-gether . " " That 's not as bad as having to fish somebody out of the bathtub . " " Why wo n't she stand up ? " " She sits there perspiring until she collapses . I think she soaks the strength out of her . Really . And then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that gives her something else to complain about . " " She 's really nuts , " Sam says . " Yeah . " " Maybe I will think about getting a dog , " Sam says . " You have any preference ? " " No . Just some mutt from the pound . " " What if I find another job , though ? Then I 'd have to leave it , and it would n't be trained . " " I told you . Get a dog that 's been trained . " " I 'd miss not having a puppy . " " Then get a puppy and just figure on not looking for a job . " " I feel bad , just sitting around . " " You can go get the groceries . " " I feel like a goddamn wife . " " If you feel like a wife , forget the groceries . I ca n't see how you 'd mind working with a dog , though . " " I 'm just being silly . I 'm going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cooked . " " Sure you did . I used to make banana bread . " " Is that what you plan on making for dinner ? " " I might make that and something to go with it . " " Go ahead . I can eat anything . " Another mistake . Sam does n't look enthusiastic any more . He pulls into the parking lot next to the restaurant . They walk into the restaurant and get a booth in the room next to the raw bar . One of the old men who works behind the raw bar has the underside of his thumb missing , a deep , perfectlyshaped oval , from opening clams when he was drunk . Charles thinks about the thumb , even though he does n't have to see it . Sam and Charles sit down in a booth . The person at the table next to the booth nods to Charles , and Charles nods back . Who is it ? He 'd ask Sam if he looks familiar , but Sam alreadyhas the menu in front of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also always looks at the menu . Charles picks up his menu . There is what appears to be a dancingcookie on the plastic cover : a circle with dancing feet and arms akimbo , pulling a fish out of the water . The water is represented by a wavy line . There are no other fish in the water ; only the one the dancing cookie pulls out . The fish who has been pulled out is smiling . Inside , all the prices have been crossed out or inked over  --  fives changed into eights with strangely shaped tops  --  and there is a little piece of paper stapledto the top left , saying that there is a ten percent increase on all marked prices . Still , it 's a good place for the money . The crab imperial is only four-fifty , and the shrimp are four dollars even . Beer is still fifty cents a bottle . The waitress comes to the table . She looks very much like the only other waitress in the restaurant , except that the other one has bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black uniform , and hands ragged with varicose veins . " I 'll have the crab imperial and a Miller 's , " Sam says . " The crabcakes , " Charles says . " What to drink ? " she says . " A Bass Ale , " Charles says . She walks away , leaving the menus . Charles studies the cover . At the bottom is written " art by Al M. , 1973 . " He putsp180the menu on top of Sam 's , looks around the restaurant . The hippie at the next table catches his eye again , and smiles . " The waiter from The Sinking Ship , " the hippie says . " Oh , sure . I knew your face was familiar . " The hippie 's plate is empty , and there are several empty beer mugs on the table . " Good food here , " the hippie says . " Yeah . ' We come here quite often , " Charles says . " This is my friend , Sam . My name is Charles , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie says , lifting his hand to Sam . " I think I 've seen you around . " He spins an empty beer mug . " Just do n't eat the food there , " the hippie says to Charles . " Why ? " Charles says . " I was making a club sandwich one night and cut my finger , and I was so fed up with the whole thing that I just turned the piece of bread over and served the thing anyway . " He takes a long drink from his half-empty mug . " My name 's J.D. I do n't guess you 'd have any reason to remember that , " he says . " They make us sign the checks . They tell us to use an exclamation point , too , after the Thank You . " " Been there long ? " Sam says . " I was there for a year part-time at night when I was in school . But after I dropped out I started working ten hours a day , six days a week . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's rough , " Charles says . " It 's rough , and I do n't have anything to show for it . Lastnight somebody slashed my tires . I get out after eleven hoursmy replacement did n't show  --  and there were the cut tires . " " Neighborhood 's getting bad , " Sam says . " It is , " J.D. says . The waitress comes to their booth with the beer , puts it down on Miller 's coasters . " How about joining us ? " Charles says . J.D. nods , moves his almost entirely empty mug to their table , sits next to Charles . " ' Who 's that clown who 's always shouting for Maria Muldaur ? " Charles asks . " He 's a sociology professor . I kid you not . He takes a newp181one home every night . The way he operates , he 'll get Maria Muldaur home eventually . " " Shit , " Sam says . " I wish I was still a goon back in college . " " Fine goon you were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I acted goony . I hollered in bars . " " You should have been there last night , " J.D. says . " Some drunk kept flicking matches at the ceiling speakers , and damn if he did n't launch one high enough to set it on fire . " " You 'd think it would burn out before it got up there , " Charles says . " I ca n't understand it either , and I was in physics , " J.D. says . " If I had the money , I 'd sit around bars again , " Sam says . " I used to have a good time sitting around bars . " " What do you do ? " J.D. asks . " Unemployed jacket salesman . " J.D. shakes his head , drains his beer . " Hey , you guys do me a favor ? Loan me fifty cents so I can get another one of these things . I 'll give it to you next time you 're in the bar . " " Sure , " Charles says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to have a date tonight , " J.D. says , " but when I called she said  --  you 're not going to believe this  --  she said , I 'm not going to be ready at seven . ' I said , What time should I come by ? ' She said , I 'm not going to be ready ever . ' Then she hung up . " " Why 'd she do that ? " Sam says . " Beats me . She asked me if I 'd take her to the movies . Called me and asked me if I 'd take her . Hell , I 'm better off not being with her , I guess , if I 've got to sit through Paul New-man . " " Hey , " Sam says . " Did you hear anything about Rod Stewart being dead ? " J.D. shakes his head . " He 's not dead , " Sam says . " That girl was putting me on . " " Somebody told you he was dead ? " " Yeah . Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women are all nuts . Another time this same girl , the one who called me to ask if I 'd take her to a Paul Newman movie , had me take her to the zoo . She had me buy her an icep182cream cone and a balloon , then she said she wanted to go home . Do n't you want to do anything else while we 're here ? ' I said , and she said , Yeah . Buy postcards . ' That was it . We went home . " " She sounds like a million laughs , " Charles says . " I do n't know . I do n't have any luck finding nice chicks , " J.D. says . " I do n't either , " Sam says . The waitress puts down their dinners . " One more beer , " J.D. says . She nods and goes away . " She 's married to the guy behind the raw bar , " J.D. says . " I saw them having a fight out in the parking lot one night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's just not many goodlookingwomen around any more . " " They all wear brassieres now too , " J.D. says . " Yeah . What the hell 's happening ? " Sam says , spooning out some crab imperial . " It 's the fucking end of the world is what 's happening , " J.D. says . The waitress comes back to the table with J.D. 's beer . " When women put their brassieres back on and want you to take them to Paul Newman movies . I used to live with a woman in New Mexico . I wish I 'd never left New Mexico . Small stuff pissed me off . I got tired of looking at roosters . She has n't put any goddamn brassiere on . " " I do n't care if they wear brassieres or not , " Sam says , " as long as they 've got tits . They sure do n't act like they 've got tits any more . " " Everything 's going to hell , " J.D. says . He swirls the beer in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys . " " I do n't think we 'll prove too uplifting , " Charles says . " You 're making this beer possible . That 's uplifting . " Somebody starts the jukebox . Tammy Wynette sings " StandBy Your Man . " " That 's all that 's left that thinks right , " J.D. says . " Redneck women . " " You see that movie ? " Charles asks . " That was a great movie . "  | " Five Easy Pieces . Yeah . I was so goddamn happy when jack Nicholson gave that waitress a hard time , even if it was just a movie . " " I should think you 'd sympathize with the waitress , being a waiter and all . " I " No . She deserved it . " J.D. points to Charles 's piece of lemon . " Are you planning to use that ? " " No . Go ahead . " J.D. squirts lemon juice in his mouth , swallows beer . " I 'm pretending it 's tequila , " he smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can pay me back next time I see you . " " ' That 's mighty nice of you . It was a real break running into you guys . " " A tequila , please , " Charles says to the waitress . She gives no sign that she heard . In a few minutes she returnswith a shot of tequila . " To sticking together , " J.D. says , downing the tequila . " Whether we stick together or not , I 've got the feeling we 're screwed , " Sam says . " Take my friend here : his last lady visitor was a lesbian . " J.D. makes the sour face he did n't make when swallowing the tequila . " But she 's not my true love , " Charles says . " My true love lies across the city , in the arms of her true love , a builder of A-frames . " " What 's that ? " J.D. says . " You mean what 's an A-frame ? " " Yeah : ' " A house . A pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an architect ? " " So much in love that she 's married the chap , " Sam says . " You would n't like her , " Charles says . " She wears bras-sieres . " Charles orders three more beers . Sam and J.D. have a long discussion of women 's legs . They can not decide between short and lean and long and lean . " Just so the legs go over my shoulders , " J.D. says . Sam laughs . Charles smiles . The next naked woman he will see will be hisp184mother , screaming in the tub on Saturday . He starts to feel very tired again . J.D. sings a song about a black woman , to the tune of " On Top Of Old Smokey . " It gradually becomes apparentthat J.D. is drunk and in no shape to get himself out  --  not that he 's making any motion to leave . Charles tries to make a sign to Sam that he should stop encouraging J.D. , but Sam 's eyes are squeezed shut with laughter . Charles looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is the way artist Al M. conceptualizes it . Artists are all crazy . Everybody is crazy . Charles wants to go home and go to bed . " J.D. , how far away do you live ? " he asks . " Why ? " J.D. says . " I do n't have a thing to drink at my place . Cranberry juice . For my bad kidneys . That 's absolutely all . You ca n't even drink the water . " " I was just thinking that we 'd give you a lift on our way . You do n't want to drive . " " Last person who gave me a lift was a queer . He said , I 'd like to bury my head in that . ' " Charles winces . " We just want to get you home , " he says . " I did n't mean anything personal , " J.D. says . " What do you think , Sam ? Ca n't we give him a ride home easy enough ? " " Sure , " Sam says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll take you home . " " I do n't have my car . I took a bus . My car is still sitting there with slit tires . " " You left it there on the street ? " " What else was I going to do ? I had just worked eleven hours . I was dead tired . What the hell did I care ? Junk . Detroit junk . They could make tires that were indestructible if they wanted to . " " I 'm going to take care of the bill , and you help J.D. into his jacket , Sam . " " I did n't mean anything personal about what I said before . I was just remarking , " J.D. says . " I know , " Charles says . " Excuse me , while I pay the bill . " J.D. staggers to his feet . Tammy Wynette is singing " Stand By Your Man " again . J.D. collapses in the booth when Charles leaves.  |p185Charles  goes to the front counter and pays the redheaded woman . He buys a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating it . Then he goes back to the table , where J.D. has his coat on . " Swear that you did n't take it personal , " J.D. says . " He does n't take it personal . He knows you were just making a remark , " Sam says . " I like you guys . " The snow is falling heavily when they go out , and everything is blanketed in white . If it only were n't cold , Charles would love to go to sleep in it , in the deep white on the sidewalk . He takes J.D. 's arm , expecting another outburst , gets none , and leads him slowly to the car . " Where do you live , J.D. ? " " I 'll give directions . Not so far . " J.D. gives directions . He will not name streets , or give the addressof his building , but he keeps swearing that it is n't far . They are riding in back of a sanding truck . The road turns brown and ugly in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then what would you guys do ? " " Dump you , " Sam says . " Do n't say that . You guys seem so nice . " " How would we get you to New Mexico ? " Sam asks . " I do n't know , " J.D. says . He looks crestfallen . " Am I going right ? You 're watching where we are , are n't you ? " " Turn left , " J.D. says . " That 's it . That building . " There is a row of buildings . " Which one ? " Charles says . " The ugliest . " Sam pulls up in front of a brown glass building . " Two down , " J.D. says . " I 'm glad you do n't think mine is the ugliest . " Sam coasts down another two buildings . It is uglier . He could n't see it well from where they were . " I want you to come in for cranberry juice , " J.D. says . " We 've got to get home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . I want you guys to come visit . You 're such nice guys . " " We 'll give you a call tomorrow , if you 'll let us have your number , " Sam says . " Just come up for a minute . " Charles feels very sorry for J.D. " Sure , " he says . " We 'll come up . " " That 's great , " J.D. says . He rolls down his window . " Thanks , " Sam says , looking out J.D. 's window to back into a parking space . But that 's not why the window was down . J.D. leans out and vomits . " Do n't hold it against me , " J.D. says . " We do n't hold it against you , " Sam says . " You guys are really goddamned nice . Anybody else , I would n't have made the effort not to puke in their car . " " I 'm glad you spared me , " Sam says . " Sure . I like you guys . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake plants in the corners by the elevator . Muzak plays in the elevator . They ride to the second floor . " This way , please , " J.D. says . Charles is holding him up by the arm . J.D. reaches in his coat pocket and takes out a key ring . " One of these , " J.D. says . Sam starts trying them . Finally the door opens . " Please come in , " J.D. says , as they lead him in . There is nothing in the living room but a mattress and a black telephone . In the kitchen , four rubber plants are growing in holes in the stove where the burners used to be . There is a black wall phone . " Look around , look around , " J.D. says . To placate him , they go into the bedroom . There is nothing in the bedroom except a brown and white rabbit standing on a pile of magazines . There is no shower curtain in the bathroom . " You just move in or something ? " Charles asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " J.D. says , sitting on the mattress . Charles nods . " Well , now that you 're here safely , I think we 'd better getp187home before the storm gets any worse . Can you let us have your phone number ? " J.D. gestures toward the black telephone . Sam copies down the number . " We 'll be in touch , " Sam says . " You okay now ? " " You guys are so goddamn nice . I 'm not drunk now . I realize that you would n't want any of that cranberry juice , and I 'm not going to push it . When you guys can , come on over and I 'll fix you a chili dinner . " " Right , " Charles says . " Good night , now . " " You 're not going to go out again , are you ? " Sam says . " I 've ruined your evening , " J.D. says . " No , you have n't . We liked talking to you . You had a little to drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your car , " J.D. says , lying down . I " No , " Sam says . " Well , good night , " J.D. says . They walk out of the apartment . J.D. waves . Back in Sam 's car , Sam lets out a long sigh . " Everybody 's so pathetic , " Sam says . " What is it ? Is it just the end of the sixties ? " " J.D. says it 's the end of the world . " " It 's not , " Sam says . " But everything 's such a mess . " " I told Susan I felt sorry for everybody , and she said there was something wrong with me . " " She 's in love with that doctor . How can you expect her to be cynical ? " Charles shrugs . They ride home slowly , watching the snow mount up . Charles is glad Sam is driving , because Sam drives much better than he does in the snow . It has been such a cold , long winter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a Fleetwood Flyer sled , and they 'd close off the steep hill at one end of his parents ' block , and there would be nighttime sledding parties , with a bonfire and hot dogs . Even his mother rode the sled down the hill once . He was so proud of her . Now she just sits around and goes crazy , but then she 'd try things  --  go sledding , make new cakes  --  she even got a set of records and tried to learn Spanish . She failed . On the sled , she scared herselfand said she could n't get her breath and went home with/out eating a hot dog with them . The cakes were just mixes . Okay  --  so she never did anything right . At least she was pretty . Or prettier . She always had crooked teeth in the bottom of her mouth , and her hair never puffed out the way other women 's hair did . Her hair always looked defeated . She had a pot belly as long as he could remember . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She used to wear high-heeled shoes . Sam tries to get his car in the driveway , but he ca n't do any more than get the nose a few feet up . The plow has been by , and it 's impossible to park on the street . The cars that are parked there have been plowed in . " We 've got to shovel , " Charles says . " You 'll be hit for sure . " They get out of the car and go in the house for the shovel . " There 's just one shovel . I 'll do it , " Charles says . " Let me . I knew it was going to snow . I 'm the one who did n't get groceries . " " We 'll take turns , " Charles says . " When you 've been out for five minutes , come get me . " Charles pulls a chair up to the kitchen window and watches . It is going to be a bad storm . He can hardly see Sam , even with the streetlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fingers of another , to warm himself . He goes into the living room and dials the thermostat up two degrees , then goes back out to relieve Sam , but Sam insists that he wants to shovel . Charles goes back to the house , takes his clothes off , and gets into bed . The bed is freezing . He lies there shaking , then falls asleep . He wakes up and hears Sam moving around the house , looks at the clock and sees that it is only midnight . He puts the pillow over his head and goes back to sleep , dreaming an intricatedream of sunflowers springing up in the snow , poisonous sunflowers that he is trying to rake under , that reappear elsewhere , in deeper drifts . Confused , he wakes up again . Sam is sitting on the bed . He pulls himself up , asking , " What are you doing here ? " Is Sam really there ? Yes . Sam is talking to him . " Sorry to wake you up . Pamela Smith is on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was on her way back when she got stranded at the Clara Barton Service Area . She does n't have any money . She does n't sound very good . I saidp189I 'd try to get out to get her , but she said she wanted to talk to you . " " What ? " Charles says . " How much did you miss ? " " What do you mean the Clara Barton Service Area ? On the New Jersey Turnpike , you mean ? " " Yeah . She came back East . She said there was trouble . " Charles gets out of bed , taking the quilt off and wrapping itaround himself . He walks across the cold tile to the kitchenphone . " Pamela ? " he says . There is no answer . " Pamela ? Hello ? " " Is n't she there ? " Sam says . He takes the phone . " Pamela ? " he says . There is only silence on the other end . " Hang up . She 'll call back , " Sam says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phone does not ring . " Well , I do n't know what the hell to do , " Charles says . " It 's a real storm out there . Did she say what kind of trouble ? " " It was garbled . I do n't know well enough to tell you . The highway will be clear , if we can get off the block . What do you think ? " " I do n't know . She always overreacts . Let 's sit here a min-ute . " Charles looks over his shoulder at the falling snow . " I was having some odd dream , " he says . " I ca n't remem-ber . " " Ask Fritz , " Sam says . " What garbage , " Charles says . Sam shrugs . " I do n't know . Somebody 's got to know some-thing . " Charles gets up , staggers toward the bedroom . " I 'm going to get my goddamn clothes on . We can take my car . It 's got studdedtires . If you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll come . " " Are you awake enough to drive ? " Charles asks.  | " Yeah . But you will be too , man , when you hit that cold air out there . " " Pamela Smith , " Charles says . " Pamela Smith does n't mean shit to me . " " Why do n't you wait for another call then ? If it 's important there 'll be another call . " " She 'd better goddamn well be there , " Charles says . " You 're sure that 's the service area she said ? " " How could I forget that ? " There is no answer from the bedroom . Charles is putting his dirty slacks back on . It is a long ride to the Clara Barton Service Area , and it is late Saturday morning before they are close to being home . Pamela Smith will not talk about what went wrong . When they persisted , she cried . " Everything I said to you , everything I talked about was just bullshit . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think . " She sat in the front seat wedged between them , and when Charles got in the back seat to try to sleep she moved over next to Sam . After half an hour of being bumped on his side , Charles sat up and sat cross-legged in the back seat , looking out the back window at the highway . He was so tired that he was giddy ; he thought about waving to oncoming cars , seeing if they 'd mistake him for a kid or think he was retarded and wave back . But he was too tired to play games . The morningsun was very bright , and it was tiring to squint so long fighting it . If only the sun warmed something . The radio was on , but it was turned down low , and Charles could only pick out a word or a phrase . Watching the bright highway , with all the cars , Charles felt even more fatigued : all of them going where ? And what for ? Pamela Smith turned around once and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's okay , " he said to her . Or he thinks he verbalized it . Pamela Smith looks very ill , with black circles swollen under her eyes . At the service area they bought her a glass of orange juice  --  all she would take  --  and she spilled some on her Wonder Woman T-shirt . She ran to Charles when he came in . He felt like a great savior , like he was really accomplishing something . The good feeling wore away as his body began to give out . Now he sits in the back seat , squinting . Occasionally there is a flurry of snow , and thep191sky clouds up , but for now it is mostly clear and harsh . The heater never makes the car warm enough . " We 're getting there , " Sam says , to no one in particular . Charles nods . Unless Sam was looking in the rearview mirror , he did n't see him . " Wonder if J.D. made it through the night , " Charles says . He thinks about the rabbit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam did not hear Charles . He was mumbling . " I figure maybe another half hour , " Sam says . " We 're lucky the snow stopped . " " How can you think of any of this in terms of luck ? " Charles says . Pamela Smith turns around . " I 'm sorry , " she says . " You 're really my only friend . " " What about your brother ? " Charles asks . Nasty , but he 's curious . " He just gave me the money on the condition he would n't have to see me again . " " That 's brotherly , " Charles says . Pamela Smith shrugs . " he did n't want me to be born . My mother says he never looked at me in my crib . They 'd have to call him over when they were giving me my bottle . He did n't look at me until I started walking . " " You did n't get raped , did you ? " Charles says . " No , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll tell you later . It was n't any one thing . " " A combination of things , " Charles says . That 's why Laura went back to Jim . Not just because he was now making enough money building A-frames to support her , but because of a lot of little things . A combination of things . He looks out the side window at a big blue truck rolling by . If he were Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces he could hop a truck , start a new life . What new life would he like ? The same life , but married to Laura . Or even living with Laura . Or even dating Laura . Or even getting to hear her holler out her car window again . She had looked so fragile , shouting out the window that she was sick . Once at her apartment she had beenp192sick , and he had rocked her . There was no rocking chair , so he sat on the edge of a chair and rocked her by bending forward and back . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She liked to be rocked ; she liked to pretend to be a child again . He bought her a mobile of little matchstick ships that he hung from the bathroom light . It was a small apartment , and they were always running into each other . He loved that . He 'd quicken his pace when he turned a corner , hoping she 'd be there so he could smack into her . He tries to imagine bumping into Betty , turning a corner and running into Betty . He could never take Betty in his arms and apologize for hitting her . There is no way he could even date Betty . He could , but he 'd be miserable . ' What would they do ? Go to a movie , or go out to dinner ? What for ? He stares at the passing cars , slumps lower in the seat . " Do n't you want me to take over for a while ? " he says to Sam . " Nah . This way I 'll stay awake . If I fall asleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , " Pamela Smith says . Neither of them acknowledgesit . Sam turns up the volume on the radio . He quickly turns it down . " False alarm , " he says . " I thought it was from the new Dylan album . " " I did n't think that was out yet , " Pamela says . " Supposed to come out sometime soon , is n't it ? " Sam says . They turn off the beltway and start down the exit ramp . Sam hums softly . " I 'll tell you what happened , " she says . " I got robbed . That was the last straw . I had twenty-five bucks , and a woman with a little kid made me fork it over . She said we were stopping for a Coke , made her kid stay in the car , and walking into the sewicearea she said she was going to stab me in the back if I did n't give her my money . I could n't believe it . She looked so goddamned maternal , in a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the knife ? ' she said . It cuts . That 's the first you get to see it . ' I gave her the money , and she left me there . "  |p193Charles  can see Sam 's eyes in the rearview mirror . His eyes are wide . " Why did n't you tell somebody inside ? They could have called the cops . " " I did n't want to . I just did n't want to . " " You should have , " Charles says . " I should have , but I did n't want to . I thought : you might as well start doing what you want to do right now ; this is as good a time as any other . So I called you . " Sam turns the volume up again . " Nope , " he says . Charles checks his watch . It is a little after noon , which will give him almost five hours of sleep before he has to go to dinner . His Saturday is shot . Sunday is always a bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work . His boss will come in and want to know what he thought of his son . He will lie . His boss always checks on his reaction : " Did you like those hors d'oeuvres my wife made for the party ? I told her it looked pretentious . What did you think ? " He has a new orange pencil sharpener he requisitioned , and the Steel City paper clips will be piled up on his desk , awaiting him . Also reports . He will eat alone . Maybe he will go to the Greek restaurant and have a good lunch , have Greek coffee and pudding for dessert . The food there is always very good , but it takes a long time to get served . What the hell . They 're not going to fire him . He 'll tell his boss that his son is a suave son of a bitch and take a long lunch hour . Pasticcio . He is hungry . " Why do n't we stop off on the avenue and get something to eat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I 'm starving , " Pamela Smith says . " If you were starving , why did n't you say anything ? " Charles says . " You 're angry at me , " she says . " No I 'm not . I 'm not mad . " He is a little mad . He is too tired to be really mad . " I misjudge you all the time , " she says . " When I came over the other night I thought you 'd be very defensive and aloof , and you were very nice . "  | " Do n't start that again . " " Ca n't a person tell you you 're nice ? " " No . Absolutely not . " " Where do you want to stop ? " Sam says . " Kentucky Fried Chicken or some place like that ? " " What do you want ? " Charles asks Pamela Smith . " Anything . " " Then stop at Kentucky Fried . " The Saturday traffic is heavy . Charles combs his hair and tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess we 'd feel worse if we were J.D. , " Charles says . " That 's for sure , " Sam agrees . " Is that a friend of yours ? " Pamela Smith asks . " Guy we met last night . . . last night ? Yeah . In a restau-rant . " " He was pretty drunk , " Charles says . " What do you think he does with his money ? " Sam says . " There 's nothing in that apartment . " " Maybe the rent is high . " " How high can rent be for a place like that ? " " I do n't know . How much can he make being a waiter ? " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " Money is worthless anyway , " Pamela Smith says . " I really felt like she might as well take it . What was twenty-five bucks going to do for me ? " Sam pulls into the Kentucky Fried Chicken parking lot . He gets out and lets Charles out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . One man has a child sitting on his shoulders . The child is picking a scab off its arm . " A family pack , " Charles says when he gets to the counter . " And a large order of french fries . " " That 's all ? " the girl says . She rings it up on the cash register . He pays , and sits on the edge of a booth to wait for it . He looks around at all the families eating fried chicken . America is getting so gauche . If there 's a McDonald 's in Paris , is the Colonelthere , too ? Kentucky Fried bones thrown around the Eiffel Tower ? He picks up his box , spots of grease dotting the outside , and walks out of Kentucky Fried Chicken . Sam gets out of the car again and Charles sits up front , the box on his lap.  |p195Pamela  Smith begins to eat a leg . Sam takes a breast . So that he does n't get both of them , Charles takes the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . There are not . Pamela Smith eats a wing . Charles eats a leg . " I 'm going to get something to drink , " Sam says . " What do you all want ? " " Coke , " Pamela Smith says . " Milk , " Charles says . Sam opens the car door and goes into Kentucky Fried Chicken . " What am I going to do ? " Pamela Smith says . " I do n't have any money . I ca n't just eat off of you . " " Do n't worry about it , " Charles says . She licks her fingers . " You wo n't even let me say how nice you are . " " That 's right , " Charles says , dropping a bone into the bag . Sam comes back to the car with a root beer , an orange , and a milk . " Your choice , " Sam says . " They were out of Coke . " " The orange , " she says . " Okay , " Sam says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ashtray . Sam turns on the radio to hear what 's playing . It is not Dylan . He turns it off . " A watched Dylan never plays , " Charles says . They finish the rest of the chicken in silence . Pamela Smith reaches into the french fries box and puts several in her mouth . " Give me some of those , " Sam says . He puts several in his mouth . " Delicious , " Pamela Smith says . " Now that I 've eaten I 'm sleepy , " Sam says . " Got to get you kiddies home before old Sammy falls asleep . " " Why do n't you let me drive ? " Pamela Smith says . Sam starts the car . He turns the radio on again , and he turns it off . Charles wonders what they will do with Pamela Smith . Just have her sleep on the sofa , feed her ? Suddenly there are two other people in his house . What would his dead grandmother think of a lesbian sleeping on the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her furniture sold to Best Bird Antiques ? Sometimes he wants to move out of the house , move out of town ... to Bermuda . He is obsessed with going to Bermuda . He would buy an underwater camera and take pictures of fish . Laura would be with him . Laura in a bathing suit . They would eat papaya or whatever they eat in Bermuda and drink rum . Their drinking rum is alwayspart of his fantasy , so he no longer questions the reality of it . Maybe they do n't drink rum . Whatever they drink . He would run around corners in Bermuda and collide with her . They would fish , pull starfish out of the water . Or whatever fish they have besides sharks in Bermuda . Laura would fix him fresh fish dinners . He would dance as happily as the restaurant menu cookie . They would walk the beach and look at the stars . They would fly to Paris and eat at the McDonald 's because it was tires amusant ( this would be the reason they would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be as happy and nutty as Scott and Zelda . Zelda died in the bin , and Scott drank himself to death . Did n't he drink himself to death ? He fell over in Sheila Graham 's living room . Whatever he died of . Once Scott and Zelda put ladies ' purses in vats of spaghetti sauce because it was tres amusant . They were assholes . The fun ended with a bang . He would be eaten by a shark ; Laura would get an inoperable melanoma . Bermuda . It probably rains all the time in Bermuda . There are probably slums all around the beaches , to remind you of the real world . He would never have the nerve to spend a lot of money on an underwater camera . Maybe he should get himself a sunlamp and an aquarium and forget about it . He and Laura would probably be blown up in the plane flying them there . They would never get to Bermuda . The rum would be i51 proof and knock them out  --  they 'd never want to screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ) Charles sighs . " I 've screwed so many people this past year I do n't even want to remember it , " Pamela Smith says . Charles starts . " That 's just what I was thinking , " he says . " How do you know how many people I 've screwed ? " " I was n't thinking about you . I was thinking about my firstsex lesson  --  a talk I had with my father . "  | " I was thinking about a pimply dyke I screwed who climbed out a toilet window and abandoned me . " " We must all go to church tomorrow , " Sam says . He takes a bite of chicken leg . " Did you ever go to church ? " Pamela Smith asks . " Me ? Sure . I crayoned pictures of Our Lord in Sunday school that still grace my mother 's bedroom wall , " Sam says . " What religion were you ? " " A Methodist . " " What were you ? " she asks Charles . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " I was going to switch to Catholicism . A long time back . " " Remember to pray for guidance on Sunday , " Sam says . " When was the last time you were in church ? " she says . " I think . . . twelve years ago . At Christmas . " " I was in church a couple of months ago . A Catholic church , " she says . " With Marian . Did I ever tell you that was her name ? " " What kind of name is that ? " " It was her mother 's maiden name . " Pamela Smith winces . " Listen to me ; maiden name . As if there are maidens any more . " " Maybe there are , " Charles says . " Maybe there are maidens in the jungle . " " What does maiden ' mean , exactly ? " Sam says . " A broad , " Charles says . " It 's funny that women got to be called broads , ' " Pamela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asses ? " " I guess that 's what it means . Yeah . " Sam pulls into the driveway . " Phew , " he says . " Seems like a week ago I shoveled this out . Those cars on the street really got plowed in good . " " It does seem like a week ago , " Charles says . " It 'll be good to get some sleep . " " Thank you very much for bringing us here , " Pamela Smith says to Sam . " Oh , " Sam says . " I live here now . " " Oh , " she says.  | " Yeah . I just moved in . " " He lost his prestigious , high-paying job , " Charles says . " I just realized , " Sam says . " I should have showed up to get the dope after work . Now we do n't have any grass . " " What would we do with it anyway ? " Charles says . " Jesus . Imagine getting stoned on top of all this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to get stoned , " Sam says . " Do n't talk about getting stoned . Marlan 's daughter was puffing away all the time , listening to Dylan records and saying , Yes , yes , ' to herself . " " Get the chicken , " Sam says . Charles leans over and gets the box from the floor . They get out of the car and go to the front door . " Look at me , " Sam says , and turns a cartwheel . " I did n't know you could do that , " Charles says . " I do n't think I ever had occasion to show you . You remember from grade school though , do n't you ? " " No , " Charles says . " And what 's the occasion now ? " " That we get to go to bed , " Sam says . Charles puts the key in the front door . " If you hear my alarm and you do n't hear me moving around , shake me , " Charles says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner to-night . " " That should top things off nicely , " Sam says . Pamela Smith flops on the sofa . She turns over , pulls the pillowunder her head . " I 'll bring you a blanket , " Charles says . " In a minute . " " Never mind . I 'm already asleep , " she says . " I 'll get you a blanket . Hang on , " Charles says . He hangs up his coat and pulls a blanket off the linen closet shelf . A pale blue blanket . His mother gave it to him . She usually gives him sweaters ( the wrong size ) and blankets . He has two other blanketsin the linen closet : another blue one , and a yellow one . She also brings him light bulbs when she visits . When she used to go out of the house to visit . He puts the blanket over Pamela Smith . " Take your shoes off , " Charles says . " You 're gon na wake up and be miserable . "  |p199He  walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water over his wrists . " I froze my goddamn wrists , " Sam says . " Try to wake me up if you hear the alarm , " Charles says . " I will . Good night . " " Good night , " Charles says . He walks into his bedroom , undresses , leaves the clothes in a pile on the floor , and climbs into bed . He has forgotten to pull the drapes ; it is light outside . He pulls the pillow over his head . It is still bright . He gets up and closes the drapes . He has forgotten to set the alarm . He gets up and sets the alarm , pulls the button . He will be getting up in four hours . Impossible . In five hours he will be in his mother 's living room . He laughs . She will serve Hawaiian Punch with rum ; Pete will have prepared . . . chicken . It wo n't be as tasty as the Kentucky Fried . They will have nothing to say to each other . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub or hold her hand while she twists and turns in bed , during which time they can discuss her illness . She will have on sneakers , and Pete will be all dressed up in a sports jacket and tie . He will have on the damned wing-tip cordovans again . They will sit in the livingroom , saying nothing , sipping the Hawaiian Punch and rum . A real travesty of the Bermuda dream . Thinking of Bermuda , he falls asleep and has a dream of a jolly fat man , water-skiing . He must be the fat man , because the fat man is wearing his clothes , except that they are bigger than the clothes he wears , all stretched out of shape . He is water-skiing down a narrow , wavy line  --  not the real ocean at all , but a line that has been drawn . There are boundaries to Bermuda  --  to the left and right there are concrete walls , and if the fat man is n't careful he will smash into one of them . There is nothing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so jolly that he pays no attention , comes within a fraction of an inch of crashing into the walls . He laughs , soaring through the water in a full suit of clothes . Charles wakes up leaning on one elbow , smirking . " Jesus Christ , " he says out loud , and falls asleep again . In his next dream he and Laura are underwater  --  without air tanks , though , with no cameras  --  and they are floppingeasily , like fish , her hair billowing behind her . She is veryp200white and beautiful , and the water is blue-green . He can feel the water against his eyeballs . They are turning somersaults , and then ' Laura does n't come out of her somersault , but keeps sinking , bent in half , sinking deeper than he can go . He tries to make his body heavier , to sink with her , but he is light , buoyant , he ca n't follow . He wakes up at the bottom of the bed , his feet pressing against the bedboard . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking hold of the sheet to pull himself . He feels dizzy . The sun is so bright . What was he dreaming ? He reaches for the pillow , sees that it is on the floor . Leave it there . Sun shining through the drapes , he falls asleep again , and this time the jolly fat man is following Laura down , laughing , cackling . There are bubbles as the fat man sinks . He can no longer see Laura , only the fat man 's head , grown immense , and the gush of bubbles . He wakes up with a headache . He sits on the side of the bed , after retrieving the pillow , but he 's afraid to shut his eyes . He leaves them open , pressed into the pillow . His throat is aching . He has a sore throat . He puts one hand across the front of his throat and somehow falls asleep again , sitting on the side of the bed , falls backward . He is sprawled lengthwise across the bed , naked , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the fat man 's arm , to hold him back , but he is sinking fast , and Charles is buoying upward , frightened , realizing that he has no air tank , that he will drown . He has to get to the top fast . " Charles .... " But Laura . And the fat man . What does the fat man want with Laura ? Why is n't he floating ? Everybody knows fat peoplefloat easily , but Charles is floating upward , neck craning for the top , for air ... . " Charles . . . . " He snaps his head forward and sees Sam sitting on the side of the bed . " Charles . . . the phone . I called you , but you did n't an-swer . " " What ? The phone ? " " Yeah . It 's Pete . I said I 'd have you call back , but he insisted . " " What time is it ? I was dreaming something horrible . "  | " I figured you were . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bermuda . Pete . Pete 's on the phone now ? " " Yeah . He says he 's got to talk to you . " " What time is it ? " " Four o'clock , " Sam says , looking at the clock . The alarm is still pulled . The hand is going around and around . The clock . Dinner . Pete . He walks into the kitchen naked , forgetting Pamela Smith . But she 's fast asleep , arms thrown open , feet hanging off the sofa . " Pete ? " Charles says . " What ? " " I 'm sorry to be bothering you , Charles . Sam said you two had a rough night . I had to talk to you , though , because I know you were expecting to come to dinner . At least I do n't imagine you forgot about dinner . " " No . What is it , Pete ? " " Well , I was washing the chicken . I had planned on a chicken dinner . Stuffed . I was rinsing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying that she was going to prepare the meal . I thought that was great . I went out for a bottle of wine and left her there , and when I got back she seemed pretty confused . She was sitting on the kitchen stool holding the chicken . She said she was n't feeling well . She wanted to make the dinner , but she was n't feeling well . I told her I 'd do it , to go lie down . She would n't get off the stool . She was sitting there holding this damned chicken . She refused to let me fix it . I finally got her to put it back in the refrigerator , but if she does n't let me fix it , there is n't going to be any dinner , because she 's not going to fix it . " " Oh , Christ , what 's she pulling now ? " " She said she was your mother and she wanted to fix the dinner . I was just doing it to do her a favor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says so herself . I thought I 'd call and let you know . Damn . And I wanted to show you my Honda Civic . " " Oh , Christ . I do n't know what to say . " " She 's in bed now . Everything 's under control . " " Okay . I guess there 's nothing I can do . I feel sorry for you , for what that 's worth . " " I always thought you did . You and your sister are real nicep202kids . Sometimes I think about what you said  --  that my own would n't do any better by me  --  and it 's a consolation . Well , I 'd bought olives for you and everything . You remember you wanted them for that New Year 's Day supper we had ? Things do n't go in one ear and out the other with me . I got olives and a chablis wine . Taylor chablis . If she had let me make it , it would have been a damn fine meal . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , call me . " " I 'm getting hungry , " Pete says , " but I do n't dare cook the chicken , even just for the two of us . That chicken is better left forgotten . I 'll go out and get us a pizza . " " I 'll drive by on my way to work Monday and take a look at your car . I leave earlier than you do . " " No . Do n't do that . I want to show you myself . " " Okay . You show it to me . I 'll see you later , Pete . " " Promise you wo n't drive by and look at it . " " I wo n't . I 'll see you , Pete . " " Good-bye , " Pete says . Charles goes back to bed . He sees that Sam is already in bed in his room . He pulls the covers up over himself and falls asleep . He wakes up at five o'clock when the alarm goes off . He gets up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't wake up again until midnight , when he gets up to take some aspirin for his throat . The door to Sam 's room is still open . Charles looks in and does a double take . Silently , Sam is screwingPamela Smith . Charles closes the door . He goes to the bathroom and gets two Excedrin . He sits on the sofa , in the dark , swallowing the water slowly . He does not feel so much like medicating himself as like drowning . The water seems too cold going down ; he finds it hard to breathe . He lies back on the sofa , listening to the whispers and creaking mattress in the other room , and falls into a deep sleep.  |p203Driving  home from work on Monday night , Charles notices that it is staying light longer . ' When he gets home from work he will have nothing to do : Pamela Smith cooks , and Sam does the dishes . They keep the house clean . Pamela Smith has dyed her hair again . Sam has gained a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they show no affection for one another in his presence . And he has n't seen her in Sam 's bed again . They have to screw all day . ' What else would they do ? Today when Betty came in to get the typing he was embarrassednot to have called her and asked again for her number , saying that he 'd lost it . Worse than that , he was specific about the lie : it blew out the car window . It sounded awful . To cover for that , he blathered on : he was going to call and invite her to a small party he was giving . Then he inquired about her sister : had she found work ? No  --  she married a man and is packing to move to Detroit . " Does the man work in the car industry ? " Charles asked . " No , he 's an accountant , " Betty said . He has no idea how to make conversation with Betty . He went back to talking about the party : maybe she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized . How is he ever going to get out of this ? Somebody answered his phone when he was at lunch and took a message that Pete called . Is his mother back in the hospital ? Surely Pete will call him at home and he 'll find out.  |p204Maneuvering  through traffic , he is very tempted to turn around and head for Laura 's . This could be it : a scene with her husband , a fight which he would lose , but maybe Ox would hurt him so badly that he 'd go into a coma and never come out of it . He thinks about cutting his wheel sharply to the left , plowing into the car coming toward him . The car passes . It was a middle-aged woman . Good he did n't kill her . Maybe the next car ? It passes . Another middle-aged woman , wearing a hat . A white car , woman inside with a green ( green ? ) hat . He begins to make a game of counting the cars with middle-aged women inside . He counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first started counting there were four cars in a row containing middle-aged women , and he thought , nervously , that the countrymight have been taken over by middle-aged women while he was working . But the next car was a teen-ager . The next was an old man , the next was a teen-age girl , and there was a car full of nuns . What a silly game. 2001 is playing at the movies . Pete told him a horrible story about how he took Clara to see it , and she screamed when the fetus came on the screen . Pete says that for a long time before seeing the movie she had been worried that she 'd go to hell becauseSusan 's twin died . The reason she thinks this , according to Pete in a whispered late-night phone call , is that she wore a red dress to the funeral . She just was n't thinking . She had a gray raincoat over it , but still . He told her it was perfectly all right , and she got out Amy Vanderbilt 's book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window ? Of course she jumped . Why do n't they admit she jumped , that knowing you do n't wear red dresses to funerals did n't make her everlastingly happy ? Because they do n't admit anything . Amazingthey ever admitted the Pueblo was a spy ship . Now Bucher is growing avocados . Tortured by the North Koreans , he returnsto the U.S.A. to grow avocados . Charles stops for gas , sees cashier for transaction settlement , parks in the parking lot next to the gas station , and goes into the store . He has been craving devil 's food cookies . Infantile . He checks his wallet and sees that he has ten dollars . He will have to go to the bank . The lunch at the Greek restaurant set him back seven dollars , and ten will never be enough to getp205through the week . He walks down the aisle , looking for cookies . He sees the dog food and misses Sam 's dog . There are a lot of dog toys in plastic , too . He wishes that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three or four , and she loved them . If anybody poisoned that dog , they ought to burn in hell . They could bum in hell with the North Koreans and formerPresident Nixon . And Mrs. DeLillo , if she really killed all those animals . And the people who do all the things the HumaneSociety keeps him posted on . He hopes that he does not burn in hell for adultery . He wishes he could be committing adultery now , instead of looking for the cookies in the supermarket . But the devil 's food cookies will be some consolation when he finds them . He intends to rip them open and eat them on the way home . It is nice to know that there will be a good dinner to follow the cookies . He is very glad that Pamela Smith forgot and ate the chicken  --  he heard about that for hours  --  and no longer considers herself a vegetarian . ( " Oh no ! " she said . " Do you know what I did without thinking ? " And he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stabbed somebody on the New Jersey turnpike and rolled him into a ditch . She 's just crazy enough to forget something like that . ) Last night she fixed a platter of vegetables and chicken with spaghetti . She keeps out of the way and does n't bother him . She certainly is n't bothering Sam . He gets the devil 's food ( two packages ) and a box of vanilla wafers and lamentsthe fact that Hydrox are no longer the same . He gets some Pepperidge Farm Lidos . He puts them all back on the shelf and rechecks his wallet . Yes , that bill he saw was a ten . Is ten dollars enough to buy four packages of cookies ? Of course it is . He adds them up in his head , finds that it is plenty . He re-adds . He forces himself to pick up all the cookies again and move away from the cookie counter , where he is lost in calculations . The rush-hour traffic is subsiding . He puts a devil 's food cookie in his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cookies . Therefore , he always puts the whole cookie in his mouth , no matter what the size . With very large cookies from the bakery , he breaks them in several pieces  --  which is not the same as biting them . Still , although the bakeryp206cookies are very good , he prefers the ones he can shove in his mouth all at once . He turns right and drives down the street that will take him to his block . He should go out at night  --  go to the movies  --  do something . Maybe he will suggest that they all go to the movies . He rolls into his driveway , Bob Dylan singing " Like A Rolling Stone . " It feels like every other day . He thinks about Bob Dylan 's children running around on the beach at Malibu . Imagine having Dylan for a father . Imagine if his own father were alive . That would be nice . His father made cookies once a year , at Christmas . Then he and Charles went out looking for cookie tins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper for others . He made German cookies with chocolate sprinkles on top that were wonderful  --  ruined only slightly by the fact that his mother told him to bite twice . He opens the front door and walks in . There is a copy of The Second Sex on the kitchen counter . He puts the bag of cookies down on top of it and goes into the living room and looks at the thermostat . He takes off his coat and is hanging it up when Sam comes out of his room . " She 's over at her brother 's , " Sam says . " She said not to wait for her for dinner . " " Is there anything to eat , then ? " Charles says . " I do n't know . I have n't looked . I was taking a nap . " " It was a gray day , " Charles says . " Maybe more snow . It 's getting colder . " He goes out to the kitchen . There is a box of dried litchi nuts next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabinets . " We ought to go out for dinner , " Charles says . " I do n't have any money , " Sam says . " I 've got money . Wait a minute  --  I do n't . I mean , I 've got six bucks . " " We can get a pizza , " Sam says . " That 's right . Okay . Do you want to go now ? " " I want to talk to you . " " What ? " Charles says . " You remember when you closed the bedroom door ? " " Yeah . You want me to leave it open in the future ? "  | " There wo n't be any in the future . ' That 's what I want to talk to you about . " " Your cock fell off ? " ' When Charles was a child he read an article about leprosy . He thought that his limbs were going to fall off , go clunk on the sidewalk . He was very young when he read it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long time he went around expecting to hear a clunk . What a twisted childhood . " She came into my bedroom that night and wanted to know if I thought it was okay to wake you up and lay you . I said I thought it was a good idea to let you sleep . So she jumped me . " Charles laughs . " Whisper women 's liberation propaganda in your ear ? " " Seriously . " " Oh , I believe you . " " And I wanted to tell you , because I did n't want you thinking , I mean , I want to apologize if I did you out of anything you wanted . " " I do n't find her attractive , " Charles says . " I do n't either . She and I do n't talk about it . " " Hell , there goes a treasured illusion : that you and Pamela Smith were shaking ass all over my house while I worked . " " Nah , " Sam says . " Did you go to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , I went down this morning . They suggested jobs I could look for and I said , uh-huh . ' I hinted around that I wanted to work in something related to religion  --  as a janitor in a church or something like that . " " What did you do that for ? " " Just off the top of my head . " " So what did they say ? " " That I ca n't get a check for two weeks . " " That 's nice of them . Do they let you starve for two weeks , or what ? " " I guess they figure I 've got a lot salted away , making all that money selling jackets . " Sam holds open the door and they go out to Charles 's car.  | " Good you headed for that one , " Sam says . " Mine gave out . Died . " " When you were driving ? " " Fortunately , no . Battery 's dead . It just would n't turn over . I took the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bus looked like a fat person in a sideshow . Except for the ones who were so old they looked like dried leaves . " " I almost took a bus the other day and decided to walk instead , " Charles says . " I 'd say to avoid them if you can , " Sam says . " I 'm going to the bank tomorrow during lunch , so I 'll remember to bring you some cash . You can pay me back when they come through . " " Thanks , " Sam says . " No wonder she says you 're so nice . You are nice . " " You 're my only friend , " Charles says . " You 're my only friend , " Sam says . " That 's pathetic , " Charles says . " How did this happen ? " " I do n't know . I just stopped seeing people or they moved or something . " " You used to have women falling all over you . " " I did , for a while . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't like me , either . I think Betty might , but she 's giving up on me . I can tell . " " They never give up once they 're interested . " " Yeah , but you have n't met Betty . She 's very , well , she 's a zombie . I do n't think she thinks about anything much . " " Sounds like you 'd do well to get her , then . " " What do I want some dumb woman for ? " " To screw . " " She 's fat . " " Get her to lose weight . Once you get her you can start talkingthat up . " " I would n't know how to tell a woman to lose weight . " " Find some way and tell her . Tell her now and wait a few weeks before you ask her out . " " I do n't want to ask her out . I just have no motivation to do it . "  | " I think Susan might have something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too bad she did n't tell us what to do about it . " " She 's nineteen . You 're going to listen to advice from a nine-teen-year-old ? " " I do n't know , " Sam says . " Maybe we should n't have cut her off . " " Sam , she reads those paperbacks about people who relive their childhood by screaming and things like that and she thinks we should try it . " " Screaming ? " " I mean , just as an example . She thinks we should do something that a book tells us to do , something that 's supposedly made everybody else happy . " " Well , what book would you read ? " Sam says . " I would n't read any book , and you would n't either if you were in your right mind . " " We do n't encourage each other . You should urge me to try something , " Sam says . " It 's 1975 , Sam . I urge you to try pizza with green pepper , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying , " Sam says . " You really are sounding defeated . I thought you could n't stand anything but cheese . " " I 'm not complaining . You 're paying . " " Shit , " Charles says . " I 'm going to order it half plain , half with peppers . " They drive in silence to the restaurant : a small brick pizza house with the Parthenon jutting out over the front door . It 's a good , cheap place . A large pizza is $3.80 . If this were a food store , Charles would be in a panic with only six dollars . " Maybe I should try green pepper , " Sam says . " I should try again and see if I like something like that . " " Why would you try it ? You do n't like it . You can have it plain . " " I want to try green pepper . " " Jesus . What am I arguing for ? What do I care how you eat your pizza ? " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what am I supposed to think when you suggest we let Susan straighten us out ? She 's my kid sister . She 's so straight it 's pathetic . She does n't even drink . " " She screws , " Sam says . " That 's straight , " Charles says . " Screwing a doctor is straight . " " Keep your voice down . " The waitress stands at their booth . " A large pizza , half green pepper , the other half mozzarella only , and a Coke for me . ' What do you want ? " " A draft , " Sam says . " One Coke and one draft , " the waitress says . " Thank you . " " You missed my point before , " Sam says . " I meant that she seems normal and happy . She must know something . " " She 's nineteen . She does n't know shit .

" The goddamn sixties , " Charles says . " How 'd we ever end up like this ? " The waitress brings a Coke and a draft . " Who gets the Coke again ? " she says . " The clergyman , " Sam says , pointing . " He stutters , " Charles says . " She wrote me a note explaining that he speaks so haltingly sometimes because he 's swallowing the stutter . " " C-c-c-clever , " Sam says . Charles laughs . Even when Sam is down , he is still funny . Sam even used to make his mother laugh . His mother used to laugh at jokes . " It 's not dirty , is it ?

Here . " Charles takes the piece of pizza and begins eating . " She 's a good cook , is n't she ? Pamela Smith , I mean . " " Yeah , pretty good . " " I mean , she 's not Laura , " Sam says , " But ... " " Shut up about Laura . " " That 's what you were thinking when I mentioned Pamela Smith 's cooking . You got that Laura look on your face .

Would you mind riding over to Laura 's ? " " That 's pathetic ! " Sam says . " What do you want to do something that pathetic for ? What 's the point of it ? " " I 'll drop you at home .

She is standing in front of the cashier , talking . " Take me home , " Sam says . " I ca n't bear to watch you make a fool of yourself .

She 'd mention it to her husband and he 'd go outside . Ox . To drive all the way over there to see Ox . Eric Clapton on the radio . Layla . Laura . Ox . Ox had better not be in sight . Sam slides down in the seat , sighing and shaking his head . " You 're nuts , this is completely nuts , " Sam says . Once he and Laura made a fruitcake . It took them all afternoon . They were going to give it to a friend of Laura 's who was sick , but they wanted it when it was done and ate it themselves . It cost a fortune to buy all the things that went into it . They bought a bag of walnuts and he cracked them . They joked  --  how did that joke start ?  --  about sending the shells to the Smithsonian , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found these peculiar things on a dig in the Blue Ridge , and did they think it might be petrified caveman shit ? He showed her the trick with the Land 0 ' Lakes butter box  --  how you could make it look as if the squaw had big tits . They ate the fruitcake and drank the brandy they had bought to use in the fruitcake . It was so rich and delicious that they were almost sick , but they could n't stop eating . He put candied cherries in their brandy . In the morning she went out and got a get-well card for the friend . They ate the fruitcake for lunch and after dinner . Weekends were so nice with Laura . The time seemed to go so fast . She had a calendar hung in the kitchen that he insisted she get rid of . He did n't even want to look at it . " But where will I write down appointments and things ?

If she and Ox ever do things like making fruitcake . He would like to soak Ox in brandy and beat him well and shove him in the oven . Ox wears size extralargeundershirts . Charles wears medium . Ox would pick him up by the collar and put him in the oven . Does Ox know about him ? And if he knows , does he know about the fruitcake they made , about all the giggling they did in Laura 's kitchen ? It would take her years to fill him in on all that . He could n't know it all . He might even get bored hearing all of it : we baked fruitcake , he showed me a trick with a butter box , we went to the movies , we did the laundry , we ate at a Japanese restaurant and did n't like the soup , we cleaned his kitchen , we ... Maybe Laura left because she was bored . Maybe that was one of the many things . She would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from work , made her go to Bermuda with him . He should have cleaned the kitchen himself . He could go tap on her kitchen window : " Another chance , Laura . " Ox would be in the kitchen . He would walk outside and kill him . " I mean it , " Sam says . " This is pathetic . It 's not like you call her and write her and make yourself obnoxious . All you do is slink over there to look at the lights on in her house . If she killed somebody you 'd take the rap for her , would n't you ? The whole Gatsby trip . " " She would n't ever kill anybody .

I remember that . My box of valentines had all been addressed , and then she showed up , and I thought I 'd better ... " " I 'll be damned ! You 're still rationalizing ! " Sam breaks in . " I 'm not rationalizing . I 'm trying to set you straight . It does n't matter to me if you want to think I liked her , but I never did . " " Everybody knew you did : ' " Even if I did  --  which I did n't  --  she was n't a girlfriend . " " You 've always liked thin blondes . Laura is just like Jill Peterson ! Did n't you ever think that ? " " Laura is twenty-nine . Jill Peterson was a kid I knew in the fifth or sixth grade . " " You know it was the sixth . " " Okay , I knew it was the sixth . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend to be vague about her . Actually , every woman you 've liked has been thin like Jill Pe-terson . " " They were all different . All the girls were different . You 're talking nonsense . "  | " Okay , even if they were . Laura is just what Jill Peterson would look like grown up . " " You sound like my sister . This is incredible . " " She might be right . You really might not understand your-self . " " Leave me alone . " " I 'm trying to help you . " But they are already on Laura 's block . " There are a million girls with blond hair . Skinny blond girls . Is that all you see by way of similarity ? " Charles says . Sam is slumped in the seat , disgusted . He wo n't speak . Charles sighs . " If it were true , why would n't I think about Jill Peterson ? " At five miles an hour , the car rolls by Laura 's driveway . The light is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too far from the road to see through . She could be standing right in the window and he would n't know it . If only the house were closer to the road . If only she did n't live in that house at all . She could live in his house . Did he ever make that clear enough to her ? Yes . A hundred times . She even agreed that his house was more spacious . She is in there , somewhere in that house , in one of those lighted rooms . He turns in a driveway and rolls by again , this time even slower . The trees are blowing in the wind . He is nothing like Jay Gatsby . Gatsby waited all his life , and then Daisy slipped away . Charles has only been waiting for two years , and he 'll get her back . He has to get her back . He will get her back and take her to Bermuda . " Bermuda ? " she will say . She always thought the things he said were strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame her for thinking him peculiar when he said the calendarhad to go . In general , though , she did n't think him peculiar . She loved him , in general . If she still loves him , he will get her back . She has to still love him . She just has to . She laughed wildly when he showed her the butter box trick . " Jesus Christ . " Sam swears under his breath as they turn back onto the main road . " I 've got to get her back . Was n't she great , Sam ? " " Here we go . I knew . I just knew it . " Sam sighs dramatically . " Yeah , she was a swell woman . "  | " I 'm going to get her back . " " I hope so , " Sam says . He shakes his head . " If she did n't like me , why would she have driven to school that day she said she 'd meet me ? " Driving home , Charles realizes that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as well , because he spent all his money at dinner . " I sure am waiting for that Dylan album , " Sam says . " I reallywant to know what Bob Dylan 's got to say in 1975  --  " Charles thinks of the cookies at home and drives faster . Devil 's food cookies . In fifteen minutes they are there . Charles heads for the cookie bag as he goes through the door . He is suddenly starving . " Have some , " he says to Sam , then sees the note next to the bag : " My brother is driving me to California . It 's a long story . I had intended to stay with you , but I realized talking to my brother that I really had to head west . I can never thank you enough for coming out that night to get me . I 'm leaving some books here that you and Sam might like , and when I get to California , I 'll call with a longer explanation . My brother is waiting . Long explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sam says , reading over his shoulder . Charles shoves another cookie in his mouth . " I 'm actually disappointed , " Charles says through the cookie . " Why ? " Sam says . " After all we went through to get her , it seems like she should have stuck around for a while . " " I know what you mean , " Sam says . " She left her sweater , " Charles says , looking at the kitchen chair . " She left in a hurry . " " You think that 's true ? About her brother ? " " Maybe he figured he 'd transport her himself , be sure to get rid of her . " " Yeah . That could be it . " " Wow . It really seems strange that she 's gone , " Charles says . Sam takes another cookie . " Well , back to cooking for ourselves , " he says . " Yeah . " " We still might hear from her before she hits the Westp219Coast , knock on wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet . " Women , " Charles says . " She 's a very odd one , " Sam says . " Do you remember when women did n't use to be odd ? I 'd pick up some girl in the park and she 'd be a nice , normal chick . " " I 've got to get Laura back " Charles says , putting another cookie in his mouth . The phone rings . " Do n't tell me , " Sam says . " Should I answer it ? " " Go ahead . " " Hello ? " Sam says . " Yes . Just a minute . " He covers the mouthpiece . " Pete , " he says . " Hello ? " Charles says . " How 's my boy ? Did I disturb you ? " " No . We just got in . " " Get into those pants , ha ha ha ? " " She 's gone back to California . " " That 's the breaks , " Pete says . Silence . " I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think sometimes that you must dread a call from me , because it might bring word of your mother being in trouble . It 's too bad I ca n't just call you and we ca n't chat without that hanging over us . " " Yeah , " Charles says . " ' What 's new ? " " Well , the reason I called , I 've been to two hardware stores today , and damned if I can find Turtle Wax . You know , that 's the stuff you want to take to your car . Get it waxed up while it 's new , you 'll never have a problem . But I ca n't find the stuff anywhere . Now , it 's not what the manufacturer recommends , but I know my car wax , and I want to go over it with Turtle Wax . If in your travels you come across it , why , buy the stuff and I 'll reimburse you . " " Sure , " Charles says . " I 'll look . " " Cooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good , " Charles says . " Things are looking up . " Silence.  | " I 'll hang up now and let you get on with it , " Pete says . " Good to talk to you , and thanks for keeping an eye out . " " Sure , " Charles says . " Good-bye . " It is nine-fifteen . He puts on a record that has always been one of his favorites : The New Lost City Ramblers with Cousin Emmy . Cousin Emmy has her red-painted mouth open wide . She looks like his mother being hauled out of the tub . He gets up and moves the needle to " Chilly Scenes of Winter . " Sing it , Emmy . He eats a cookie and tries to think what to do to get Laura . Sam is right ; he ca n't keep driving by her house . He will call her . Tomorrow . He 'll call her and ask to see her again , ask whether he can meet her at the school for just five minutes . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can see her and put no time limit on it . He 'll be a little casual . He wo n't say it 's important the way he did the other time . He will just say that he 'd like to see her . He wo n't tell her he loves her on the phone  --  nothing to scare her away , nothing to give her an excuse to say no . And then he 'll see her . What will he say ? ' What will he say to persuade her never to drive home again ? He gets up and walks around the house . Pamela Smith 's things are everywhere . He will have to box them and send them . He hates wrapping things for mailing . Maybe there 's a way to get Sam to do it . Sam has more time than he does . Get Sam to do it . He opens the Lido cookies . They are wonderful . He gets a glass of water and paces the kitchen . What can he say to her ? ' What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches the eleven o'clock news . He gets in bed with a magazine . At midnight he calls good night to Sam and turns off the light . He thinks back over the day . One thing keeps coming back to him : when he was leaving work he stopped at the blind man 's stand for a Hershey bar . " What have you got ? " the blind man said and Charles was suddenly tempted to break into song with , " I 've got a neverendinglove for you . . . . " He laughed out loud when he thought of singing that to the blind man . " Hershey bar , " he said , and laughed again . The blind man reached out and felt the Hershey bar before he took the money from Charles . He felt all along it , and had his head cocked to one side when Charles left . The blind man is beginning to distrust him.  |p221Standing  on the eleventh floor waiting for the elevator , Charles sees Betty out of the corner of his eye . She had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducked back in the doorway when she saw him . She has given up on him , does n't even want to talk to him . She picked up his reports today without even saying hello . He could n't think of anything to say to her , so he did n't look up . Now she wo n't even wait for the elevator with him . He feels sorry that he has been cruel to Betty , but he just ca n't get interested . He has been in a bad mood all day because Laura 's phone rang and rang . She never did answer . He stayed at work later than usual , hoping to catch her before Ox got home . He finally stopped dialing , sure that Ox would pick it up . He could have hung up on Ox , but he does n't want him suspicious . He does n't want Laura blaming him for anything . He has to be very nice and very careful and get her back . Betty and another woman walk through the corridor to the elevator . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand over the edge of the door to make sure it stays open for them . The elevator is packed . He gets on along with ten people from the eleventh floor . Bob White is pressed in the back . He nods hello . Betty is standing next to Charles . " How are you ? " Charles says . " Tired , " Betty says . She turns and talks to the woman next to her about dinner.  | " If you 're not doing anything for dinner , why do n't you two come over to my place , " Charles hears himself say as he walks off the elevator in back of them . They stop , looking confused . He has never seen the other woman . She is much prettier than Betty . Sam would n't mind . " I was just saying that I could n't go at all , " the woman says . I have no baby-sitter . " " Oh , that 's too bad , " Charles says . " Maybe some other time , " Betty says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make it . " " I 'm awfully tired to go out , " Betty says . " But thank you . " " Let me walk to your car with you , " he says . Why is he sayingthis ? She shrugs . She says good-bye to the other woman at the door . " Change your mind , " Charles says to Betty . " Actually , I have no car . It 's in the shop for a valve job . I was walking to the bus stop . " " Let me drive you home , then . " " All right , " she says . " Thank you . " They walk silently to his car . He thinks of his dancing teacher : " Closer , closer . " He is walking six feet away from Betty . He moves over about a foot . She does n't seem to notice . Her coat collar is turned up . She looks like a turtle . She has a sharp nose like a turtle . On all fours she might look very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't like to stop by for dinner ? I have to go to the grocery store anyway . A friend is staying with me and his battery 's dead , so he could n't go out to get groceries . " " If you 'd like me to , " Betty says . " Thank you for inviting me . " What would you like for dinner ? " he asks . " Whatever you 'd planned to have is fine . " He never plans dinner . He would have gone home and had water and cookies . " I 'll stop and get us some steaks . " He opens the car door for her . Her legs are fat . He averts his eyes  --  shower room etiquette  --  as she climbs in . He walks around the car and opens hisp223door . She did not pull the lock up for him . She does n't like him . He does n't want her , and she does n't want to come . " How long have you worked there ? " he asks . " Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was twenty . " This woman is only twenty-four ? How could anyone be so ... solid at twenty-four ? He turns on the radio and catches the end of a plea for money . Just like going home and opening the mail . The Indians want him . The starving orphans in Ghana . The mistreated kittens . He realizes , suddenly , that this was the day Sam was going to drive him to work so Sam could clean out his apartment . They are both so disorganized that nothing gets done . He is amazed by people who can shop for a whole week 's groceries on one day  --  that they know what to get , and how much of it , and that they will want to eat those things for sure during the next week . He looks in his wallet at the first red light . There is plenty of money . He has forty , and there is a twenty tucked in the back to lend Sam . He could even use that in the grocery store if necessary . Betty looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her eye . " I 'm fascinated by men who can cook , " Betty says . " My fatherwould n't even open a carton of milk for himself . My mother or my sister or I had to do it . It seems lately that quite a few men cook . " " It 's that or go out , " Charles shrugs . Betty says nothing . He has botched it . He cut her off , and she was making polite conversation . " Your father really would n't open a milk carton ? " he asks . " No . He would n't . When my mother bought the things , she 'd always open and close the milk again , and she 'd take the caps ' off the soda bottles and put on those rubber ones to seal them . He 'd pop one of those off . He 'd carry on if he had to use a can opener or rip open the milk , though . That 's part of the reason I moved out . That and my mother telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? " he says . " My nose . " " You do n't have a bad nose . " Her nose is her worst feature . That and her weight.  | " Thank you . I 'm very self-conscious about it . " He should say something else : flatter her more . He changes the station on the radio . " What did you do before you started working ? " " I worked at Western Union for a while , and as a checker in a supermarket . I trained to work in a bank , but I quit after the training . The people were so nasty , and the money looked so ugly . " " That 's quite an assortment of jobs . " " I kept kidding myself that I was going to college . How can you save money working at Western Union ? When I had a littleextra money at the supermarket I spent it joining a health club . The exercises made me sore , and I got a kidney infection around that time and had to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started learning the ropes . And then I took the exam to get into the government . I always knew how to type . " " When did you get your apartment ? " " Over a year ago . A girl was living with me , but she quit and went back to Georgia . " " She did n't like the job ? " " She did n't like the city . She had me so upset that after she left I was afraid to go out at night , and I had a bolt put on the front door . When you live with somebody who 's always telling you what danger you 're in you start believing it . " Betty lights a cigarette . " Do you mind if I smoke ? " " Go ahead , " he says . Cigarette smoke makes him sick . They ; are almost at the supermarket , though . He concentrates on not coughing . He always coughed in Laura 's car . Laura , smoking 1 Chesterfields . She will die young . He had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot . As he walks in , he takes his wallet out of his pocket and checks . The forty is still there . He puts it back . He takes it out again , going through the electric door , and searches for the twenty . Because if it took more than forty , he would need that money . He knows he is being silly . He knows that steaks for three people do n't cost forty dollars . " Do you have enough money ? " Betty says . " Oh , yes . Checking my wallet is a nervous habit . " Betty nods . He is sure she does n't believe him.  |p225He  goes to the meat counter and gets three T-bone steaks . " What else do you like ? " he asks . " Potatoes , " she says . " Potatoes . Where would they be ? " He follows her . He picks up a bag of potatoes . He gets a package of spinach and a large bottle of Coke . They stand in line . He wonders if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People used to mistake Laura for his wife . " Your wife left this , " the woman at the bank said , when Laura left her hat on the table . People used to smile at him when he was with Laura . They do n't smile now . " Working makes me so tired , " Betty says . " You could do some isometrics , " he says . What is he talking about ? " Do you know the exercises ? " she says . " I have a book you can borrow . " Pamela Smith left the book . What is she going to think if all those women 's lib books are still lying around ? She 'll think it 's peculiar he reads GermaineGreer and Kate Millett and Simone de Beauvoir . And if she asks for an opinion on any of them he 's sunk . Maybe Sam cleaned . He is sure that Sam did not . " I 'll probably be having that party this weekend , " he says . ' What did he bring that up for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no reason to believe him . There is no possible way he could have a party over the weekend . He could call J.D. J.D. might come to the party if he did n't have to work . That would make him , J.D. , Sam , and Betty . Pete would come for sure . Pete would be so flattered . What a travesty that would be . What would Betty say to Pete ? " I 'd be glad to come over and help you get organized , " she says . " Thanks , " he says . He pays for the food and is very relieved when he sees that he has enough money . How would a psychiatrist work him through this trauma ? Tell him to go to a store and get more food than he has money for and see that it 's not the end of the world ? Probably . Shrinks . The indirect approach : " Do n't you think . . .
