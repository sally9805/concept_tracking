THE GOAT , THE WOLF , AND THE CRAB <P> by GILLIAN MARTIN 186 pages . Scribners. $7.95 . <P> <P> Hannah Jackson , 42 , is told by her doctor that she has cancer of the cervix . Fortunately the disease is at an early stage . One operation and then Hannah can resume the life of a middle-class English suburban housewife . She says no . She will take the two years remaining to her , thank you , and call it a life . Irked at having his advice dismissed so airily , and by a woman to boot , the doctor asks Hannah why . " I have not done anything at all without someone else 's interests being the prime factor , " she replies . " This is the last opportunity . I insist on doing this in my own way . " <P> There are several ways in which a novel based on such a premise could run rapidly downhill . It could sour into morbidity or fist-shaking stridency or traipse into a misty , philosophical meadow , where every delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . This tightly constructed first novel makes no such blunders . English Author Gillian Martin uses Hannah 's perverse decision as an occasion not to settle old scores but to examine some unexamined lives . <P> Hannah 's is the most fully studied , since the story is chiefly seen through her eyes . Her bouts of introspection are awkward , because she is unaccustomed to looking at herself except as an extension of her husband and children . Her audacity in refusing surgery puzzles her : " She does not mislead herself that she wants to die . Rather she wants to stop living her life . " But why is she incapable of starting anew ? The answers , not all satisfactory , come piecemeal . <P> Hannah blames her mother for teaching her that life 's greatest virtue is snug security , and she regrets the husband , the only man she has ever known , who so perfectly lived up to her mother 's ideal . Most of all she blames herself for spending her years listening rather than thinking . <P> The novelist keeps Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those around her . Gestures like Hannah 's shake the pillars of society ; friends and loved ones are forced to reassess her life and theirs . Especially torn is Hannah 's husband , who is treated as anything but the ogre who pops up in much current feminist fiction . A well-meaning man who has be come the " bill-paying machine " everyone expected him to be , Henry Jackson first tries to bully and then to cajole Hannah into the operating room . He argues sensibly that she is chasing after a romantic ideal , unattainable in life and certainly in death . " I 'm a good dentist , " he tells her . " And I might have been a good artist instead , if I 'd had a chance to try . But I do n't want the chance . " <P> Hannah wants the chance but , as Martin shows , can not have it . A brief affair with a charming but faithless acquaintance ends badly-and produces most of the novel 's few patches of uncertain writing . Hannah 's lover " begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - a cliche that strikes a discordant note no matter what the tune . <P> Such slips are rare . The Goat , the Wolf , and the Crab raises troubling questions about the worth of inherited values ; it engages the mind as well as the emo tions . The line between this novel and a three-handkerchief tearjerker is the hard edge of truth .
