Her trip was proceeding without an awkward moment when the American television reporter asked the question : What made her think she was fit to discuss serious matters with heads of state ? Rosalynn Carter 's hazel eyes flashed with anger . Said she : " I think I am the person closest to the President of the United States , and if I can help him understand the countries of the world , then that 's what I intend to do . " <P> And that is just what the nation 's First Lady did last week as she began an ambitious , 13-day swing through seven Caribbean and Latin American countries . By phone , she regularly reported to her husband who-as always - was proud of her performance . Jimmy Carter predicted confidently that the foreign leaders she meets " will be both surprised and pleased at what she knows and how close she is to me . " <P> Vexing Matters . Rosalynn put her personal touch on the trip , employing a specially designed monogram ( see picture ) that was put on everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the ice at her meetings by speaking Spanish . TIME Correspondent Stanley Cloud , who accompanied her , reports that she moved quickly and easily into discussions with her hosts about such vexing matters as U.S.-Cuban relations , economic policies and military aid . Said a top White House aide : " Jimmy wants to show these countries that he cares about them and is interested in their problems . In his mind , the best way he could do that-short of making the trip himself-was to send Rosalynn . " <P> She faced a tough challenge at her very first stop-the beautiful but economically blighted island of Jamaica . Prime Minister Michael Manley , a fiery socialist , has hinted at a capitalist U.S. plot to overthrow him . But Manley was the soul of propriety when he greeted Rosalynn at the airport and said that her husband 's emphasis on human rights offered " great encouragement . " <P> In all , they talked for more than seven hours , and she did her best to assure the Prime Minister-an admirer of Fidel Castro-that U.S. policy toward Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House announced plans for a limited exchange of diplomats with Havana , a step toward resuming full relations . <P> Rosalynn also showed her concern for Jamaica 's problems by making an emotional visit to two social service centers in a Kingston slum . Crowds lined the narrow streets as she walked three blocks from one center to the other , and an eleven-year-old girl broke through the guards , hugged her and traipsed along with the President 's wife beneath the tropical sun . <P> Flying to Costa Rica , Rosalynn adroitly deflected President Daniel Oduber Quiros ' plea that the U.S. raise its quota on beef imports from his nation.Said she : " I could not promise anything that we could not deliver . " <P> As the trip wore on , Rosalynn was increasingly taxed - both mentally and physically . In Quito , the 9,350-ft. - high capital of Ecuador , she needed two doses of oxygen to get over the effects of the altitude . She calmly informed members of the ruling military triumvirate that the U.S. was not likely to lift trade restrictions imposed after Ecuador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
