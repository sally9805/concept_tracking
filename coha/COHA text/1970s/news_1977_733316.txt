txt UP AROUND NEWCASTLE , in the northeast of England , New York is finally going to be a city that works . That 's because it will be run by a computer as opposed to a mayor . And its problems will all be small ones , in keeping with the size of the town . You see , the New York near Newcastle . will be a miniature Big Apple , one of the main attractions of a theme amusement park to be called The New World . The New World is the creation of ? sorry , Leif Erikson and Christopher Columbus ? a British company that specializes in parks featuring countries and cities in miniature . For instance , the Best of Britain , a miniature theme park in Dorset in the southeast of England , has , among other things , Windsor Castle , the ' rower of London , a motorway , and the queen going to the opening of Parliament . If you 've been in the Loop recently , you may have seen the mini-Buckingham Palace in a Marshall Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the Best of Britain . Tile folks who run the BOB think the Close-up with Dorothy Collin miniature theme park is , well , Tumorrowland . BRIAN SLOMAN , spokesman , salesman , and marketing man for the company , is going around the United States trying to convince Marriott that Great America would be even greater with a mini-park included ? to convince Disney that miniatures are n't goofy to convince Busch which owns the Busch Gardens parks ! that Watney 's which owns the mini-parksl knows best . " America is tile most sophisticated amusement market in the world , " Sinman said . " You are 20 years ahead because of Disney . But American amusement parks have gone almost as far as they can go with rides . " So to keep people busy between pizzas , hot dogs , and cotton candy , and between roller coasters , bumper cars , and what we used to call at Riverview , Shoot the Chutes , Sloman is suggesting mini-parks , especially ones focusing on American history . " I think Americans are basically receptive because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given Americans an insight into their culture , " he said . " Instead of constantly looking to the future , which of course , made America // America the fanciful : Britons ' cup of tea ? // a great country , you are now also looking over your shoulder to see why you became great . " IN EUROPE , PARKS that feature beautifully crafted models of towns and cities have been around for more than 20 years . And they have proved to be big attractions . The Best of Britain has had more than 2 million visitors since it opened in May 1976 . Whether Sloman and his company can sell their idea in the New World or not , The New World will be built , to give Britons and Europeans an idea of what happened to their ancestors ' wandering cousins . The British version of America will include " Jamestown , of course , with colonial ships in the harbor , " Sloman said . " Then we will follow the settlers striking west . There will be one of those kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a mountainous valley ? which conveniently will have the Mt . Rushmore heads of the Presidents on one side . " We will have the southern end of the States with the hacienda-style buildings . " The what ? " The hacienda-style buildings they have in California and New Mexico . " Well , I suppose those states are in the southern end of the country  --  just as Mt . Rushmore is across a valley . " ON THE RIVER , " Sloman continued , " we will have typical Mississippi paddle wheel steamers and the towns on the river down to Mexico . " Mexico ? I guess that 's no worse than Americans who think the Thames runs up to Scotland . " Then we have modern America , " Sloman said . " The Seattle World 's Fair Space Needle , the Capitol , the White House , and , naturally , of course , Independence Hall in Philadelphia . " And then there is a montage of New York with the George Washington bridge , the Statue of Liberty , the New York skyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be tied together . There will be trains from the Canadian Pacific and the Union Pacific and jumbo jets at airports and ships from colonial times on , and that ceremony , You know . . . . " The Golden Spike ? " Right . " THE AMERICAN SITES and events to be included In The New World were chosen from " research , from trips over here , from listening to the American people , " Sloman said . He said Jamestown was chosen instead of Plymouth because " Jamestown had closer links with Britain because of supply routes . " It also had closer links because most of the Pilgrims were n't on such good paper back in the old country . ? He said the Seattle Space Needle was chosen to symbolize the space age because a model of Cape Canaveral would " look very barren unless there was a rocket there doing something . With the Space Needle , you do n't confuse it with anything else . " Now , then , for those of us with virulent Second City complexes , why New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in Chicago  --  asked about it a lot . Close-Up in is with the railroad . Because of the animation we use , that will be an important site . " Now , people have mentioned the infamous Twenties , but that 's not the right king of homage to Chicago . Also , it would be hard to animate the gunfire . " But I would n't want to play down the railroad . The railroads are the reason for Chicago 's massive growth . I hope we can capture the idea of the trains coming in to a central point with the plains in one direction and the East in the other . " To keep a sense of proportion about all this , you should know that the New World will be built at l-g4tft scale , so the Empire State building will be about 60 feet high . At least , the English will cut New York down to size . " BEAR IN MIND that this Is being built In England and that skyscrapers and big cities are synonymous with New York .
