A fringe benefit of being a radical is occasional free trips to Washington to see your Government in action . . . Become a subversive and see the Government from the inside . Make your Government pay your way there . <P> HUAC ( House Un-American Activities Committee ) pays seven cents a mile . If you 're coming from California that 's almost twice the youth fare : which means you can live for two months free on HUAC 's tab . HUAC finances the revolution ! <P> - Do It ! by Jerry Rubin <P> There are other tricks in the radicals ' bag , all of them similarly formulated to keep participants alive and well and living in the revolution . Often with no visible means of support , today 's young radicals remain sufficiently if not well-fed , adequately if erratically clothed , and able to catch the first wind of protest and the nearest available means of transportation in time to show up in the front lines from Berkeley to Birmingham , from Chicago to Kent State . Celebrities like Jerry Rubin and Abbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies : Rubin 's book Do It ! has already earned him $45,000 ; Hoffman 's Revolution for the Hell of It and Woodstock Nation have raked in a cool $75,000 so far . Like other members of the Chicago Seven , they can command lecture fees of several hundred dollars . But for the rank and file of the movement , survival in the society they are working to destroy - and the financing of the machinery to effect that destruction-depends upon a curious combination of primitive-tribal Communism , good Samaritanism , soak-the-sucker capitalism , live-on-the-dole socialism and the riding spirit of Robin Hoodism . <P> Weil-Heeled Liberals . There are several means of funding the movement . A showing of Cool Hand Luke on the Berkeley campus netted $500 for the Inter-Strike Co-Ordinating Committee . Boston 's Progressive Labor Party regularly holds bake sales and dances , this month drew 200 sympathizers to a rock concert at M.I.T. Biggest contributions , both of money and equipment , come from well-heeled liberals who support the radicals ' drive for peace if not their revolutionary tactics and theories . The big earners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of their profits back into the movement . Then there are " windfalls , " like the one at San Francisco State College last year , when radicals seized control of the student-activities fund , amounting to more than $400,000 , and parceled out large sums to black militants and an organization that was blatantly Maoist .
