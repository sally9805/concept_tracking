Although he could have . retired 25 years ago , he detested idleness , and pushed himself to work at his craft .. When asked some years ago what he would do when he was no longer a star and could not get work , he . replied : " I 'd keep acting even if I had to get on the back of a truck .

Planned to Be a Banker Born on Aug .. 31 , 1897 , in Racine , Wis. , and originally named Frederick Bickel , Mr. March was the son of a small-time manufacturer , John F. Bickel , and the former Cora Brown . Marcher . He worked as a bank teller during high school vacations and studied economics at the University of Wisconsin ; and when he came to New York in 1919 after a year in the Army , it was not to be an actor but a banker . This was in spite of the fact that he had always been interested-in theatricals and had played leads on the university stage , had been a champion college debater and had had modest success as a part-time newspaper and magazine model . He had even quietly sent out r ? sum ? s and photographs to agents and producers .

By that time the young actor with the square-cut , all-American good looks had decided that Bickel was not a good name for a marquee . He dropped a couple of letters from his first name and adopted the first syllable of his mother 's maiden name to come up with the stage name of Fredric March . Versatile , cooperative , eager , he was seldom without work . In ' Denver in the summer of 1926 , Mr. March joined a stock company whose leading lady . was Florence Eldridge . While appearing together in Molnar 's " The Swan , " they fell in love , and were married in 1927 in Mexico . Their union , both personally and professionally , was to last for the rest of Mr. March 's life . In the late nineteen-twenties , the moguls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound in movies  --  many of the dashingly , handsome stars of the silent movie era possessed voices of startling squeakiness , nasalness or raspiness . Mr. March struck Hollywood as the answer to a prayer , for not only was he the possessor of a virile and handsome profile that could meet the ' most rigorous demands of the camera close-up , but also he had a rich , well-trained stage actor 's voice . Instant Film Success His movie career began in 1929 with a featured role in " The . Dummy . " He was an instant success , and soon some , of the top female stars were ' clamoring to have him in their pictures . In the , nineteen-thir-I ties Mr. March appeared oppo- , site Clara Bow , Ruth Chatter- , ton , Claudette Colbert , Miriam , Hopkins and finally Greta Garbo in " Anna Karenina .

He and Miss Eldridge bought advertising space ' in trade publications that showed a sketch depicting them as two trapeze artists missing each other 's grip in midair . " Oops , sorry ! " read the caption . The Marches tried again in " The American Way " the following year , with better results , and from then on Mr. March was to deftly balance his work between movies and plays . " It has been my experience , " , he said years later , " that work on the screen clarifies stage portrayals and vice versa .

And although he was still a man of imposing good looks , he quite willingly submitted to make-up that gave him a bald pale . He believed in immersing himself in a role . Some of Mr. March 's most memorable screen performances were in Noel Coward 's " Design for Living , " in which he played a flip sophisticate ; as the poet Robert Browning in " The Barretts of Wimpole Street " ; as the alcoholic and suicidal actor opposite Janet Gaynor in " A Star Is Born " ; as the zany reporter in " Nothing Sacred " ; as the widower in love with a much younger woman in " Middle of the Night " and , of course , as the war-weary veteran in " The Best years of Our , Lives , " Films in which he also appeared , with Miss Eldridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Columbus , " ancl " An Act of Mercy : " On stage the Marches appeared together in " The Skin of Our Teeth , " Thornton Wilder 's frolic , and O'Neill 's " Long Day 's Journey Into Night , " which Mr. March considered the high point of his career . A Serious Approach A story concerning that major triumph illustrates how seriously Mr. March , ' took acting , and the extent to which he would go to perfect his playing in an individual scene . In . the now famous Bard scene , Mr. March , in the role modeled after O'Neill 's own actor father , was called upon to play solitaire while delivering highly charged , emotional lines intended to prepare the character Tyrone 's two sons for some grave news . A friend of Mr. March who was involved with the show recalled that during rehearsals the actor insisted on devoting an hour a day to that one scene , so that he could practice it alone . " He wanted to perfect his technique with the cards so he could concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled . " Even when we 'd take a break he 'd be working on the scene  --  that 's the way we 'd find him when we returned . " The actor 's preparation for the role was well rewarded . There were universal critical accolades , with Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times writing : " As the aging actor who stands at the head of the family , Fredric March gives a masterly performance that will stand as a milestone in the acting of an O'Neill play . . . This is a character portrait of grandeur . " In his Hollywood , heyday , Mr. March felt he was becoming type-cast as a " costume actor " and vowed that once his longterm contracts had run ' out , he would never sign another mu ! - ; tiple-picture deal . That was in the nineteen-forties . He was I also intensely , sometimes fool- , ishly , selective about the Broadway roles he would consider . For example , one script he was offered in the late nineteen-forties was . about a traveling salesman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it , on a cursory reading , " too grim . " The play was Arthur Miller 's " Death of a Salesman , " and the role of Willy Loman went to Lee J. Cobb , who became the season 's toast of Broadway . The play won ' both a New York Drama Critics Circle award and a Pulitzer Prize in 1949 . Mr. March later explained that he was making a film in Rome when he received the play script and " I did n't , have the time to read it properly . Boy , I sure blew that one . " The producers of the movie version . of the play gave Mr. March his second chance , and he won an Oscar nomination in 195,1 for his film portrayal of Willy Loman .

" Hunt for Communists In 1940 Mr. March was one of many Hollywood personalities who ran afoul of Representative Martin Dies , then chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities , who had started a'widely publicized hunt for Communists in the film-making community . Mr. Dies denounced Hollywood as a horbed of radicalism , which struck Mr .. March as " scattershot , unfair and ill-advised . " He openly defended the film community and his having lent his name to pre-World War II liberal causes , and so incurred the wrath of Mr. Dies , who promised to take a searching look at Mr. March 's own politics . The Congressman later apologized to Mr. March and placed him on a list of " politically clean " figures that included James Cagney , Humphrey Bogart and the writer Philip Dunne .
