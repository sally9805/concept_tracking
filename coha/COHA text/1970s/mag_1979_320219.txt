King Hassan 's expansionism heats up the Sahara <P> Morocco 's King Hassan II , 50 , has long been one of the U.S. 's most valued allies in the Third World . But Washington policymakers worry about the deceptively boyish monarch 's ambitious territorial expansion into the former colony of Spanish Sahara . Reason : the more he grabs , the deeper he appears to sink into the sands of economic troubles at home and political isolation abroad . <P> On the military front , Hassan has been locked for almost four years in a no-win war against the guerrillas of the leftist Polisario Front , which is fighting to turn the barren but phosphate-rich , 103,000-sq. - mi. slab of desert into an independent " Saharan Arab Democratic Republic . " At home , he has had to contend with rising public anger and labor strikes prompted by a deteriorating economy ; it has suffered both from the decline in the price of phosphates , which provide a third of Morocco 's export earnings , and from the war 's cost , estimated at $1 million a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by other Third World countries but even by former Western patrons like France . Worst of all , since the Polisario is based in and backed by Algeria , Hassan 's socialist antagonist to the east , the King regularly runs the risk of provoking a wider , full-scale war between North Africa 's two most populous countries . <P> Earlier this month Morocco 's smaller neighbor to the south , Mauritania ( pop . 1.5 million ) , abruptly made a separate peace with the Polisario and gave up its own claims to Tiris el Gharbia , the lower reaches of the Western Sahara . To forestall a Polisario takeover there , Hassan promptly occupied the area with 2,500 legionnaires and proclaimed it Morocco 's 40th province . Though it was cheered by flag-waving children , that annexation sorely raised the level of tension across the Maghreb . Algeria immediately accused Hassan of being manipulated by " colonialists and imperialists . " The Polisario vowed to " intensify military operations inside Morocco as well as within the Sahara territory . " It was no idle threat , coming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military operation to date : a frontal attack by 1,500 guerrillas , equipped with light tanks and Sam7 anti-aircraft missiles , against two battalions of Moroccan regulars at Bir Anzaran , just 60 miles from the Atlantic coast . <P> Though the six-hour battle left 500 Polisarios dead , compared with 125 Moroccans , according to Rabat 's claims , the attack clearly shocked Hassan . Last week the King himself made a somewhat desperate public pitch to justify the annexation and try to regain some international support by portraying himself as the guardian of Western interests in North Africa . Shifting the focus of the conflict , he accused Libya most of all for the destabilization in the region . " Colonel Muammar Gaddafi would be happy if a conflict broke out between Algeria and Morocco , " the King declared . " We would both come out of it so weakened as to ensure his leadership in North Africa . " At the same time , he went out of his way to be conciliatory toward Algeria and invited a negotiated settlement .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
