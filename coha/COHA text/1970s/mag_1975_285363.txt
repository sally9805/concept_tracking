<P> Long-simmering rumors about Leonid Brezhnev 's failing health boiled up last week into a wild journalistic borsch of speculation . In Europe , the U.S. and the Middle East , newsmen variously reported that the 68-year-old Soviet party chief had been struck down by a staggering variety of ailments , ranging from abscessed teeth , bursitis , gout , influenza , pneumonia to heart attack and-most ominously-leukemia . The Boston Globe carried the electrifying tale that Brezhnev was momentarily expected to arrive at the Sidney Farber Cancer Center for treatment of this deadly blood disease . Despite Brezhnev 's conspicuous nonappearance at Logan Airport , and vehement denials of the stories by directors of the Boston clinic as well as by ranking American diplomats , the rumors persisted . Inevitably , so did speculation that a power struggle was mounting in the Kremlin for Brezhnev 's top job as General Secretary of the Communist Party . <P> Certainly there was no hard evidence to support the rumors that Brezhnev was on the brink of physical or political disablement . Nonetheless , a few faint signs and portents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brezhnev 's vigor and perhaps even of his commanding position in the Kremlin . Some observers at the Vladivostok summit meeting with Gerald Ford thought that Brezhnev was not his usual doughty , ebullient self . Although he held up well during his initial seven-hour meeting with the U.S. President , he slept late the following day and looked peaked . In Paris for a state visit two weeks later , Brezhnev declined a sumptuous lunch offered him by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing . On the other hand , the Soviet chief was sufficiently revived that night to give a dinner for French Communist Boss Georges Marchais . <P> In Pajamas . The mystery of Brezhnev 's health was compounded by the medical and diplomatic ambiguities involved in the abrupt cancellation of his scheduled trip to Cairo . Although this was apparently related to Soviet-Egyptian diplomatic disagreements , an unprecedented effort was made in Moscow to display Brezhnev as a sick man . Summoned to Moscow to be informed of the cancellation , the Egyptian Foreign and Defense ministers were given white surgical gowns before being received by Brezhnev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Egyptian visitors , the Soviet leader told them that his doctor had ordered him to abstain fully from political activity . <P> At this point , some of the arcane details dear to Kremlinologists began to assume significance . It was noted that Brezhnev had not been photographed , televised-or seen by foreigners-since Dec. 29 . The Kremlin 's New Year 's greeting to the Soviet people , which traditionally has been broadcast by a ranking party leader , was read by a radio announcer in 1975 . These incidents could be explained by the death of Brezhnev 's 87-year-old mother over the New Year holidays . Indeed , the Soviet press agency Tass reported that Brezhnev had attended the funeral last week . Nonetheless , there were such unusually heavy police and security precautions around Moscow 's Novodevichi Cemetery that no Western observers were able to verify his presence . At week 's end Tass had not yet released promised photos of the party leader at his mother 's grave .                  @ @ @
