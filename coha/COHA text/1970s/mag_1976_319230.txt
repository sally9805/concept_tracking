Feminine awareness has not killed chivalry , but it has subtly changed the rituals of social encounter between the sexes . Chivalry as an explicitly male-to-female practice has always implied a world of condescension-weaker women deferred to , cosseted , on the implicit theory that they were physically handicapped . Some women mourn its decline . <P> " I feel ambivalent about change in the small ways , like a man standing up or holding the door , " says Enid Slack , community affairs director of the United Bank of Denver . " There is now a fear syndrome in men . They are afraid women might be so liberated that they might be offended by such courtesies . " <P> But customs seem to be loosening up in a rather healthy way . The sillier , automatic practices are giving way to a standard of simple courtesy on the part of both men and women . Many women eliminate the problem by simply moving first , opening their own doors , striking their own matches , wrestling on their own coats before men have the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held open a door for Betty Friedan and then apologized , saying , " I hope you do n't mind . " Said Friedan : " I love it . I would have held it open for you if I had gotten there first . " <P> Meanwhile , some of the linguistic extravagances of the women 's movement have fallen into a deserved oblivion . Rarely now does one read of " herstory " as the feminist version of history . But there remains serious feminist sentiment in favor of calling God both Father and Mother , or considering him asexual . <P> The great battle of the suffix person is still unresolved . Chairman briefly became chairperson , but many now settle simply for chair , as in " she was the chair of the committee . " The problem with person-policeperson , committee-person , showperson-is that it sounds ridiculous . The Naval Academy wisely insists that its women students will be called midshipmen . Person is still acceptable when used independently to designate either a man or a woman . When White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of person instead of man . <P> Ritual pairings of the sexes seem less obligatory . Many hostesses no longer worry about having equal numbers of men and women at a dinner party . It is regarded as awkward , if not rude , to pair men and women at such occasions or to insist on " boy-girl " seating at the table . The 19th century after-dinner protocol of sexual segregation-at least where initiated by men-has long been fading . Such formality persists in some Washington circles . But last August , when she was asked to " join the ladies " after dinner at a party given by Averell Harriman , Washington Post Reporter Sally Quinn stalked out of the house . <P> Women more often come to parties alone and leave alone . Increasingly , they come and go at bars in the same way . Last week four of the six people sitting alone at the bar of Hopper 's Restaurant in Manhattan 's West Village were women who had wandered in for a post-Christmas drink . No one paid any special attention to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
