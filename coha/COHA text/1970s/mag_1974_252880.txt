Remember the old stand-by two-liner , " Who was that lady I saw you with last night ? " Well , today it is more likely to turn up translated into something like Comedian George Carlin 's street-dude one-upper : " Hey , man , what 'd ya do last night ? " Answer : " I was out wit ya muther , man ! " And the audience guffawing at it is most likely gathered not down at the old vaudeville house , but at home round the old stereo . <P> The comedy record , which has been gathering dust at the back of record racks since its heyday in the early ' 60s , has made a major comeback . More than 15 comedy albums have been released in the past six months . <P> A few of the new albums are shots in the old vein-Veterans Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks with their 2000 and Thirteen-year-old man or the literate stand-up style of David Steinberg 's Booga Booga . But the hottest newcomers are the " rock " comics , whose pot-and pop-flavored material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By far the most successful of the rock comics are Richard ( " Cheech " ) Marin , 27 , and Tommy Chong , 33 , an energetic Chicano-Chinese duo whose freakish cast of characterizations includes Sister Mary Elephant , Ashley Roachclip , and Buster the Body Crab . Their first two albums have sold 4 million copies so far , and their newest , Los Cochinos , jumped onto the pop charts at 22 , a feat usually accomplished only by top rockers . But several others are stalking comedy 's new-found rock audience in their wake . <P> Last year 's Grammy for Best Comedy Record went to George Carlin , 36 , who began as a straight-suited standup . Now sporting chest-length locks and painted undershirts , Carlin tells low-key tales of his kidhood on the fringes of Harlem : " You put five white guys and five black guys together and after a month . . . what you 'll see is redheaded guys named Duffy sayin ' ' What 's happenin ' , baby ? ' " Carlin also deals heavily in various bodily functions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blithely reels off the rapidly dwindling list of banned mots-the kind of vocabulary that got Lenny Bruce arrested . <P> Albert Brooks , a cherubic 26-year-old with a curly halo , has a softer approach in recounting his adventures as the opening act at Neil Diamond and Richie Havens concerts . His album , Comedy Minus One , could even be taken home to Mother-provided Mother was reasonably aware of what gets smoked at rock concerts . Singer-Songwriter Martin Mull is the only newcomer who is literally a rock comic , laying his words on music . His hit record is in fact an instrumental called Dueling Tubas . His other folk-rock ditties include Ventriloquist Love ( " Whenever I kiss you , your lips never move " ) and the ultimate Hare Krishna lover 's gambit : " I made love to you in a former life , why ca n't we do it now ? " <P> Dope and Dirty Words . Perhaps because politics today provides its own , few of the new comics play with political satire . Most of rock humor seems securely tied up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally supplies the subject matter . The dirty words , no longer reserved as final zingers , are strung right along through almost every sentence-alternating , of course , with the word man , the sine quanon of the species .
