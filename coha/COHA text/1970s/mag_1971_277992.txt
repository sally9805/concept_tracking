HOWEVER hard he tries , a President can rarely mold the Supreme Court to his ideological image . Richard Nixon may be an exception . With the appointment of only two Justices , he has already helped to blunt the judicial revolution that began in 1954 , when Earl Warren wrote the court 's unanimous decision outlawing school segregation . That historic ruling was followed by scores of others involving race relations , voting , and capital punishment-many of them containing unprecedented guarantees of individual rights in America . Now , as the new Burger Court nears the end of its second term , it seems obvious that the Warren years of legal daring are over . <P> The Warren Court 's major instrument for change was the 14th Amendment . Ratified after the Civil War , that amendment was primarily designed to safeguard individuals , especially blacks , against state infringement of two rights : due process and equal protection of the laws . At first , U.S. courts interpreted those rights cautiously , fearing to upset the delicate balance between the state and federal governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it " incorporated " most Bill of Rights safeguards in the 14th Amendment and thereby imposed them on the states . To the Warren Court , due process required the same fundamental fairness in state as in federal courts , and in case after case it found that state procedures did not measure up . As for equal protection , the court vindicated the rights not only of blacks but also of larger disadvantaged classes , from the poor to underrepresented city voters . <P> The Burger Court has served notice that it will not retreat from the Warren Court 's sweeping school desegregation manifestoes , at least so far as Southern de jure segregation is concerned . Last term it ordered Southern public schools to desegregate " at once . " This term it told lower-court judges to use all means necessary , including busing , to dismantle the South 's dual school systems . In perhaps its most far-reaching decision on race , the Burger Court ruled unanimously this spring that businesses can not use educational requirements to screen out minority job seekers arbitrarily . <P> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessor . Where the Warren Court often upset state laws that ran contrary to its broadly conceived egalitarianism , the present court avoids such confrontations whenever possible . It has often been unreceptive , for instance , to suits on behalf of welfare recipients . As a result , it has down-played the 14th Amendment and even trimmed some of its forerunner 's key rulings . The new approach :
