THE bristling mustache above a bone-stiff upper lip . The wind-up doll gestures . The suave delivery of platitudes in a deep and resonant voice . Those trademarks of Thomas Edmund Dewey came to symbolize a full decade of Republican Party frustration in the presidential politics of the 1940s . That is unfortunate , since Dewey was the prototype of all crusading young gangbusters in his 30s , a crisply efficient three-term Governor of New York in his 40s , and a premature but valued elder statesman of his party as early as his 50s . Nevertheless , he will be remembered chiefly as the man who blew a seemingly certain election to the presidency by his serenely somnolent campaign against Harry Truman in 1948 . <P> Thomas Dewey had mellowed in his later years . Teased about the fact that his dark hair was finally beginning to thin , he could pat a balding correspondent on the head and reply : " Who are you to talk , you old bastard ? " Yet he could never completely shake his waxen image as " the bridegroom on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way when he died last week of a heart attack after playing 18 holes of golf in the 90 heat of Bal Harbour , Fla. , his favorite winter refuge . In another week he would have been 69 . <P> Backbiting . Dewey reached vainly for the presidency three times . Near the end of a sensational career as a prosecuting attorney in 1940 , he sought the Republican nomination . Dewey stumped the nation , headed into the Philadelphia convention as the favorite . But no one had ever leaped from D.A . to presidential candidate , and the party 's old pros could not accept the brash , young ( 38 ) Eastern upstart . They turned instead to an older , more personable novice : Indiana 's Wendell Willkie . <P> Dewey came back in 1944 as Governor of the most populous state to wrap up the presidential nomination on the first ballot . His impossible task was to challenge the Commander in Chief in wartime ; many voters thought that rejecting Franklin D. Roosevelt would comfort the enemy . Dewey refrained from attacking F.D.R. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bickering , quarreling and backbiting by the most incompetent people who ever held public office . " He lost , but drew a surprising 46% of the popular vote . <P> Cunning Men . It took Dewey three ballots to regain the nomination in 1948 over Ohio 's Robert Taft , Minnesota 's Harold Stassen , Michigan 's Arthur Vandenberg and California 's Earl Warren-and the nomination was considered tantamount to election . The nation seemed weary of the frenetic days of New Deal innovation and the burdens of war and postwar readjustment . Harry Truman was a feeble contrast to the fallen F.D.R. , and the Democratic Party was split ( Strom Thurmond had deserted to run as a right-wing candidate , Henry Wallace as a left-wing challenger ) . Voters yearned for tranquillity , and Dewey , running a campaign designed to avoid controversy , promptly put them to sleep . Soothingly , he pleaded : " We need a rudder to our ship of state , a firm hand at the tiller . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
