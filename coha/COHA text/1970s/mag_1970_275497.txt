VICE PRESIDENT Spiro T. Agnew returns to San Clemente this week after a palace door-to-palace door selling trip for the Nixon Doctrine in Southeast Asia . If he had to file a salesman 's report on his tour through the territory , it might read something like this : " They know they 'll have to buy it eventually , but they 'd just as soon hold off as long as possible . If they have to take it now , they 'd like as many optional features as they can get free . Suggest hard-sell follow-up . " <P> It seems certain that only future hard bargaining with the countries visited will demonstrate the effectiveness of Agnew 's mission abroad , although its value to Agnew is automatic as quotable experience on the campaign hustings this fall . Generally the trip was business-like and low-keyed , with one unadvertised , dramatic stop in Cambodia . In one form or another , all the conversations were about implementing the essential elements of Administration policy : gradual U.S. military withdrawal from Southeast Asia but continuing U.S. aid to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : SOUTH KOREA : Agnew arrived in a light drizzle to see President Chung Hee Park , whose natural inclinations toward hard bargaining and specific , written commitments were reinforced by domestic political needs : he faces an election in the spring . In his talks with Agnew , Park reportedly settled for a face-saving agreement : gradual U.S. withdrawal of all its forces from South Korea and U.S.-aided modernization of the ROK army would be treated in parallel , a semantic nicety that left U.S. plans and Park 's domestic position intact . The nicety did not come easy . The meeting between the two men went on for six hours instead of the two scheduled , and Agnew is known to have had to consult the Western White House after it was over . He told newsmen traveling with him that even though " it might take five years or more . " all G.I.s in South Korea would be withdrawn when ROK forces were modernized . TAIWAN : Agnew 's visit to 82-year-old Chiang Kai-shek was the closest thing to a courtesy call on his itinerary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Agnew himself summed up Chiang 's request for more modern jet planes even before he arrived in Taiwan . " I would guess , " he said of Chiang , " he would like to have anything he can get . I have never seen him refuse anything . " SOUTH VIET NAM : From the moment he arrived at the presidential palace in Saigon until the moment of his departure , Agnew moved about under total security and in almost total public silence . Perhaps by design both Agnew and President Nguyen Van Thieu had chosen to speak out before his arrival . En route to Saigon , Agnew explicitly ruled out as a topic of conversation the timetable for American withdrawal from Viet Nam beyond that already announced by Nixon . Thieu made his opposite views known in an interview with TIME . " We need to know-not publicly of course - just how fast will be the redeployment to determine how we are going to cope , " he said .
