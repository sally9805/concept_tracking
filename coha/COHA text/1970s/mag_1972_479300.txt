IN SAN QLIENTIN there is so much racial paranoia that provocation is unnecessary to incite the alence . Almost any excuse is enough to start e killing . So it was that the prison 's last epimie ( as opposed to the routine stabbings ) ben with events just slightly related to race . The 700 inmates of the East cellblock stragNI back from the messhall after the evening The five tiers were crowded . Some men tiled near their cells for lockup . Others roamed , igered cigarettes on the NCAA basketball , als , which would be broadcast over the cell rphones , or tried to hustle a bindle of heroin , a 7 of acid , a quart of hornebrew , or anything at would soften the edges of reality during the ig night . A humming roar of noise hung over erything , a sound so common and pervasive in cellhouse that it went unnoticed by those acstomed to it , the kind of sound that attracts . ention when it stops or the rhythm changes . Tonight the rhythm changed . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , evicts nearby froze and turned , wary as anids at a sharp sound . Others , on tiers above d below , craned their necks to see what was ing on . Tension spread like electricity through nnected wires . Men forty yards away knew thin seconds that something had happened . The gunrail guard , his khaki uniform ( rather HI the usual green worsted ) indicating a ikie , was drawn to the sudden jumble of mon . He saw something . His whistle bleated , rented itself , amputated the last vestige of doubt it someone was being stabbed , for San Quentin convicts long ago gave up fistfighting to settle disputes . If it 's not worth killing about , forget it , for if you punch someone in the mouth they 're liable to come back later with a knife . Now silence fell , except for the scrape of runninc , feet . More than one man was breaking through the crowd to get away . The guard leveled his rifle , but was unable to shoot into the press of bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming accusation , but his quarry disappeared down the stairs . Guards on the cellblock floor failed to arrive before the assailants got away . Someone bad been stabbed . The question was : white or black ? And then : was the stabbing across racial lines ? If a white had stabbed another white , or a black another black , the incident would end with the participants and their cohorts . But if a black had stabbed a white , or vice versa , there was no telling what might happen . Mexicans make up 13 per cent of the convict population , and many are quick with knives , but usually it 's on another Mexican ; and even if it does cross racial lines it has n't , as yet , resulted in a general war . The first rumor had black against black . Four blacks appeared on the floor , pushing a flatbed handcart used to move laundry hampers and metal trash barrels . Now it carried a " brother " being rushed toward the hospital . He was on his back , legs drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his white T-shirt . The blacks who pushed the cart would have let a white man die , and a white convict who gave aid to a black ( unless the white was assigned to the hospital ) was ostracized by other whites , if not attacked . On the gallery of tiers above , hundreds of convicts watched the exiting group . Rumor now was that he 'd been stabbed and thrown from the tier , but that was hard to believe . His head was raised . He was alert . Nothing seemed broken . The human body breaks when it drops thirty feet to concrete . Extra guards rushed into the building . The public address speaker blared : " Mandatory lockup ! All inmates lock upi " The Watch Lieutenant began questioning inmates with cells near where the incident had occurred . While the officials tried to find ' out what had happened , the convicts already knew . The tier workers carried the word while making their rounds selling grilled cheese sandwiches ( two for a pack of cigarettes ) or delivering outfits and narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed the black . The anger had commenced in the education building where there had been an exchange of stares , then sneers , and finally hot words . Both assailant and victim came from worlds where it was impossible to conceive , much less articulate , the senselessness of murder arising from locked stares and nothing more . When word got around that it was Chicano and black , most whites relaxed , uninvolved and glad about it . Some especially militant blacks conspired to retaliate : a brother had been hit and revenge was required . Chicanos recognized the possibility of trouble and readied themselves . Black tier tenders delivered knives from mattresses , ventilators , and drainpipes . Chicano cell-block workers did the same . ( Despite repeated searches of the sprawling prison by an elite squad of half a dozen guards with special equipment , any convict wanting a knife can have one in minutes . ) No more than ten on each side actually armed themselves , taping large and crudely honed ( but deadly ) knives to forearm , easy to jerk from a sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket so the blade rested on a bare thigh and the handle was hidden . It could he drawn in an instant . As in the Wild West , a quick draw sometimes decides who lives . The prison slept without anticipating that the match was set to the tinder of black hate for Whitey , and that the ensuing flame would continue week after week : stabbings and murders , attack and retaliation , ending only through attrition. indeed , it is n't over now , not really .

The yard is half again the size of a football field . The immense faded-green cellblocks wall the yard on three sides , holding out the sun until it rises high .

The shed 's roof is marked from bullet holes of warning shots fired upward . By 7:30 the East and South cellblocks finish breakfast . The yard fills with denimed convicts streaming from the messhalls . The gate from the yard to the rest of the prison 's walled areas ? shops , factories , and education department ? remains closed until 7:50 . Just before the gate opens , two thousand convicts fill the yard . In recent years the races have segregated themselves . Along the North ceilhInck wall is the ghetto , where the blacks congregate .

Mexicans and whites have the rest of the yard , but cliques and gangs are commonly found in certain areas , where an individual can seek out his friends when the yard is crowded . In the messhall , Anglo and Mexican eat together , but blacks have again segregated themselves . The mingling of white and Mexican does n't mean that all Mexicans are friendly to all Anglos , or vice versa , but they are generally closer to each other than either is to blacks . The morning following the East eellblock stab . bing , the yard was silent . The usual flux of movement was also missing . Three hundred blacks stood balefully near the North cellblock staring at the Mexicans , about one hundred of whore were gathered under the shed to the right of the blacks . Another hundred Mexicans stood facing the blacks across thirty yards of empty asphalt Almost all whites stayed back . Among these were two dozen young Nazis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang Twenty or more whites were sprinkled among the Chicanos , ready to back " horneboys " or close friends .

The staredown went on for ten minutes while to messhalls continued to disgorge prisoners Ito the yard , swelling the ranks . The riflemen recluded an open riot .

Half the convicts in the yard streamed out , glad to avoid possible trouble . The warriors on each side remained . ' So did the riflemen , allowing the conference to go on because it might settle the incident without further bloodshed . The conference broke up . The Mexican stalked back to his followers , said something and gestured toward the gate . His clique left the yard . The black spokesmen went to the throng along the North cellblock . A dozen blacks crowded tight around them . listening to what was said . The public address system blared an order to clear the yard . The confrontation broke apart , became clots of walking men . In minutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dustpans and small brooms sweeping up orange peels from the breakfast ration . Rumor had it that the trouble had been avoided . No whites knew what was said .

V ilIILE THE TROUBLE WAS BREWING between Chicano and black at the school building , another fuse was being lighted elsewhere . Two burly whites with reputations as brawlers had swindled a black for twenty papers of heroin . giving him a phony $100 bill . An hour after the confrontation in the yard , the swindled black and his friends trapped the two whites on a stairway in the South cellblock and began swinging knives . The whites , both young and strong , managed to fight off being killed , but they were badly carved up and hospitalized . The leading white clique knew about the burn , knew what lay behind the stabbing , and judged that it was justice .

Nothing occurs unretracted through racialist lenses , often delu-sional A religious doctrine of hate HE PHENOMENON OF ENRAGED BLACKS ex- isted in prison long before anyone dreamed of Detroit . Watts , or the hot summers of the late Sixties . Indeed , both Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver first experienced racial militance in prison . But what is relatively new and what increases racial polarization in prison beyond conciliation is the mutative leap in black militant rhetoric . This rhetoric is heard within the prison walls by unsophisticated minds and gives those blacks who already hate all whites a rationale for murder . Such a black takes " off the pig " and " ten for one " as a license . He can find murder to be the means of assuming dignity in his own eyes , in having identity . Blacks have taken to killing prison guards , without any hope of getting away , almost as if seeking martyrdom as a form of suicide . Everyone understands that blacks have been brutalized by generations of institutionalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathetic fail to grasp is that sometimes the psychological truncation is so great that it can not be repaired . Nothing is left but hate . They have no desire ? no motivation for anything except revenge and license for whatever they desire . Additionally , they 've decided that they are political prisoners . The black realizes that he has committed a crime , or has acted against the statutes . However , the claim of " political prisoner " comes from the argument that he was formed by a corrupt system , that his acts are a result thereof , and therefore he can not be held responsible . Secondarily , he feels that he has never been a part of this system , but is still in slavery , and consequently the white laws do not apply to him . Such personalities are often found in prison , where the flower of black racism is blossoming , virulent and paranoid . Many white convicts are equally dangerous and intractable , but they at least intellectually accept that their acts are wrung . And even white racists recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , whereas blacks are open in their racism . The catechism of Elijah Muharn mad 's Black Muslims that all whites are " beasts " that Moses raised on their hind legs and led from the caves has wide following in prison . Such doctrines seem absurd , but blacks with third-grade educations and Baptist parents who inculcated them with an inability to function without some religion believe this doctrine as zealously as devout Catholics believe in the Immaculate Conception . Elijah allows them to have God and hate Whitey too . Black Muslims , however , incite no violence . Separatist and racist . the cult eschews violence except in self-defense . Muslims follow a moral code John Calvin would have approved . Other blacks , particularly the Panthers , have attained a political consciousness transcending racism . They realize it is n't white convicts who oppress them . They will war for their kind , but they do so with misgivings , just as many white warriors do , knowing their enemy is elsewhere . But race relations in California prisons have reached such an impasse that politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potentially rich vein of revolutionaries ; and white convicts , all too aware that guards often seize writings proclaiming white genocide and the joys of bayoneting a pregnant white woman , see all blacks as animals , a direct threat . The space between races QUCH WAS THE GENERAL SITUATION when the Mexican stabbed the black in the East cell-block ( he was n't hurt bad and immediately informed on his assailant t and the two whites were stabbed over the heroin swindle . Noon came , and again the yard was filled with convicts . Again there was the open space between races . This time whites faced blacks and a iew Mexicans stood with the whites . The stabbing of the whites was well known . but the under . lying cause was less well known . All blacks and most whites were unaware that the warrior whites had decided to let the matter drop . Movement was turgid , sound subdued . The lunch hour was passing . Suddenly a dozen guarth rushed through the yard toward the North cell-block . Something had happened there , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the appearance of the guards , even the slow movement ceased . All that moved were the sea gulls overhead . The silence became complete Kloments later four white convicts rushed from . the cellblock , carrying a man on a litter . A guarc ran along beside them . As the retinue crossed through the white crowd , convicts walked along side and asked what had happened . The wounded man had been napping in his cell ( doors in do North cellblock are left unlocked ) and one of two blacks had crept in and stabbed him whit ( he slept . He did n't know who they were . He'c been selected because he was white and asleep . On the yard both sides pulled back into tighter - arks . The guards overhead tightened their grips in rifles . A voice cried out in rage : " Goddamn uckin ' niggers ! " A voice yelled back : " Fuck , uu , honky ! " Some blacks thought of rushing the whites . Ile whites were ready . So were the riflemen Overhead . N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet uncommitted to act . Though numerically nperior ( 50 per cent of the population to 35 per ! ent for blacks ) whites are less united along racial ines . Unlike blacks , they can not believe all vhites are their brothers . There 'd be nobody tgainst whom they could compete if they beieved that way . Indignation swirled , but it iad n't decided to lash outward . The white who 'd seen stabbed in the North cellblock was just an iverage convict , not someone special . Trouble night have subsided if that had been it . But an hour later a fifty-year-old white convict vent up the stairs into an old building housing wo classrooms . He was being transferred and ranted to say goodbye to a teacher . Three blacks , . ere waiting at the top of the stairs . They . nocked the man down and began stabbing him . ' hey 'd never seen him before . They 'd been vaiting for any white . The teacher , hearing the wands of struggle , opened the door , saw what ms happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed toward the scene , caught he blacks running out the stairway door . As they /ere led away , they yelled : " Power to thepeople ! " The elderly white convict was slightly wounded . The order came to lock the prison down . Each department was released separately , the convicts filtered back to the cellhouses in groups that could be supervised . Paranoia ran high , for on the narrow tiers it was impossible to keep the races apart . Who could know when , or if , the long shins would be pulled . Men without friends , those trying to quietly serve a term and get out , were in the worst predicament . They had no allies . Warriors stayed together , knew many of their opposition , suspected others from hairstyle , mannerism , and association . Whites were indignant and afraid . Blacks were jubilant and afraid , though they waited to yell their joy until they were locked in their cells where their quips and laughter were anonymous . Guards and freemen began a search of the prison that would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Personnel filed along the fifth tier without warning until two were before each cell . Riflemen behind them gave cover . Security bars were raised and convicts were ordered to come naked onto the tier . As soon as convicts on lower tiers knew what was happening , knives were thrown between the bars , sailing down to clatter on the floor of the bottom tier . Actually , it was unnecessary to discard the weapons , for the searchers were sadly out of physical shape , used to sitting on their asses . Before they 'd finished two cells they were panting , unable to do more than perfunctorily raise a mattress . Many just walked into cells and sat down . On each tier behind the cells is a narrow service passage with plumbing and electrical conduits . Convict electricians and plumbers have access to the passages . Guards found two dozen knives and three roofing hatchets in the East cellblock passageways . The arsenal belonged to whites because the plumber and electrician were white . The huge cellhouses were silent and motionless as tombs during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had gone too far to end . Whites had to make a showing . If there was no reprisal the blacks would stab and rip off whenever they had the whim . The decision was made by many individuals rather than collectively , just as the decision to stab was made individually among blacks . 11-1HE LOCKUP CONTINUED the next day except 1 for essential workers . The few members of the white clique and other white militants out of their cells managed to pass a few words on a grapevine . The idea came to wait to strike until the prison was back on normal routine . No stabbings occurred on Wednesday . The lockup was too tight . Every convict out of his cell was searched several times during the course of the day . On Thursday the West cellblock returned to normal schedule . A few other workers and clerks were pulled from the breakfast lines and told to report to their assignments . The associate warden called many inmates . He wanted to know the mood of the prison , the depth and intensity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . too out of communication , and those to whom he talked lacked prestige or influence in the yard . He appointed a committee to " cool " the situation , but those on the committee were without respect among their peers , especially the blacks on it : the very fact that they 'd talk to the " chief pig " closed them away from their brethren . While the associate warden was holding interviews , the blacks struck again . A fifty-five-yearold semi-nut was coming up the back stairs in the South cellblock . A prison character , he 'd served twenty years and was a compulsive writ writer . He bothered nobody but the authorities . He gave coffee and tobacco to anyone who came to his cell and asked . He was particularly generous to blacks , mainly because they had less and did more asking . Four of these waited on the stairs . They jumped him , stabbed him in the face and neck with a fork bent so that two prongs jutted out . The wounds were superficial . Two attackers were caught immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their cells at mealtime through fear of retaliation . One hid under the bed . When he was locked in segregation he bellowed about the " honky we downed . " A black prison administrator meanwhile summoned three militant white leaders . He wanted them to assure him nothing more would happen . Two stood silent , heads down , preferring to say nothing . The third flushed , stuttered : " Five whites have been downed , old men and strays who did n't do nothin ' to nobody . Next they 'll want us to pluck our eyebrows and get a black jocker . Me , I 'm not promising anything . " The whites ' plan of waiting for normal routine was gaining acceptance as it was discussed . Nazis and Hells Angels hacked away , claiming that none of their brothers had been hit and they would stay on the sidelines until that happened . The blacks were still on the offensive , not waiting for Whitey to strike back . A few workers were out of their cells in the East cellblock , sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were instead roaming the tiers , looking for a victirn . Two had been involved in the murder of a white tier tender in 1969 . On the fifth tier a white was standing outside a cell . The tier was empty . The white was an old-line convict and knew the score . When the blacks started toward him , the white knew what was happening . Luckily , the men in the cell before which he stood had a twenty-inch shiv with them . They handed it out . The blacks saw what happened and turned away . It was not exactly cowardice . Even if they killed him , he would certainly wound one of them , and wounds would get them caught . On the fourth tier , another white , a motorcycle rider , was in front of a cell , trying to buy a tab of acid . He worked in the messhall scullery and had just gotten off duty . The cell he stood before was in the center of the tier . Two blacks came toward him from the rear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front . The white was caught between them . He saw them and sensed danger , for he backed up against the rail , refusing to turn his back . He spread his arms , resting his hands on the rail and leaning back , as if he was looking toward the tier above . He was probably trying to hide any evidence of fear . A smart convict or a warrior , black or white , would have climbed up or down without hesitation . This man was insufficiently afraid to save his life . The black from the front arrived first . He pulled a knife and rushed the last ten feet . The white threw up his hands . The knife went between them and plunged into his chest . The blacks from the rear arrived an instant later . One knifed the man in the back . The biggest of the trio grabbed him from behind , pinned his arms . The first black stabbed at his throat . The blade entered just above the collarbone , drove down through his lungs and punctured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . The second black with a knife kept tabbing him . There were no screams , just agodzed grunts and gasps ? and the horrifying ound of tearing flesh . Mirrors jutted from cells long the tier , periscopes of men trying to see hat was going on . Whites began yelling and attling the bars to drive off the killers . They ; ere watching a murder and unable to do any-fling . Questions were yelled from other tiers : Dennis ! What 's happening ? " Answer : " Them ackin ' niggers downed a white dude . " A black oice : " Gon na get all you honky mother tckers ! " The blacks ran to the rear , down the stairs . A - ... ore of guards arrived on the run . Only six lacks were out of their cells . All were taken into ustody for investigation .

He instead ordered nine whites locked up , lends of the victim who also worked in the itchen . The logic was that they might try to taliate .

Inmates in cells near the murder were quesoned . Whether any talked in the privacy of an Tice is known only to officials , but none will T HE SENSELESS MURDER in the East cellblock changed the minds of whites about waiting for revenge until the prison was opened . During the afternoon , blacks yelled : " Kill them honkies ! The pigs got Brother Leroy and J.T. , jive-ass moth erfuckers ! " Whites were quiet , saying nothing . When the slow unlock for supper began , one tier at a time , faces showed how things were going . Groups of blacks were laughing and joking . Whites were glum , brooding . Whistles suddenly bleated as the fifth tier was unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their cell , lying in their blood . One walked out , seriously wounded . The other was half under the bed , spurning blood from his mouth with each breath , indicating a punctured lung . A gunrail guard had four whites covered , and blacks on the tier were pointing them out . Most guards were uninterested in investigating what had happened . The victims lived . They claimed that two whites had started stabbing them the moment the doors were opened ; and that two other whites had held the other blacks at bay . The whites claimed that they were attacked and had taken the knives from the blacks . Forty-eight hours passed without a stabbing . The lockup separated the antagonists . The weekend approached . Officials discussed return to normal . Kitchen workers were already on fairly regular routine . The kitchen has a locker room and shower area isolated from the rest of the kitchen . To get to it , one must go up a very narrow , concrete-walled stairway . More than one unsolved murder has occurred in this locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was literally torn from his throat . A guard supervises the shower room , but duties sometimes take him elsewhere . On Saturday morning , half a dozen whites filed up the stairs , each with a knife in his belt .

One saw the attack and ran through a door into a wire enclosure , bracing himself and holding the door closed . The other four blacks had nowhere to g , In seconds , blood was splattering the wall Blacks were running in circles , bumping int each other , followed by the knives .

The whites , believing the alas was given , fled before finishing off the other thrc blacks . One died , his spinal column severed . went into a coma and never came out of it . The kitchen sergeant 's attitude mirrored a investigation . The victims were never show photos to identify . Higher officials were cripple by the indifference , if not recalcitrance , of the subordinates , who were not even making an a tempt to apprehend anyone . " Snitch " letters bypassed the guard level I the warden . He ordered several whites locked u ) Three were innocent . One of them had bcc locked in his own cell during the attack .

No more friendships existed across racial lines . A fistfight broke out between three whites and four blacks on the morning following the kitchen attack . Whistles shrilled ; a rifle went off . Nobody was hurt , but more men were locked in segregation . Tension remained near general paranoia . In a world absolutely integrated , each cell identical with each other , each man eating the same food and wearing the same clothes , the race hatred was malevolent and intractable . Nor was there a sanctuary where any man could relax . Even the cells were dangerous . A ten-ounce coffee jar filled with gasoline could be hurled against the bars and a match thrown on it . This had happened before . Going to eat , the prisoners were in crowds . A group of whites or blacks might he gathered in a doorway or on a stair landing .

Neither side entirely believed the other ( no white can speak for every white , nor any black for every black ) .

Again the administration returned to normal schedule . Two months passed without a racial stabbing , a hundred men still segregated ; others have been transferred .

Something will ignite another race war in a week , a month , or six months ? and nobody can explain what either side will gain . In California prisons it 's too late for rapprochement between races . Could it be a precursor for society as a whole ?
