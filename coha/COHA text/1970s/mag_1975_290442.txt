When T/Sgt . Leonard Matlovich handed his coming-out letter to his superior officer , a black captain at Langley Air Force Base , Va. , the officer said : " What the hell does this mean ? " Replied Matlovich : " It means Brown v. the Board of Education . " <P> Matlovich , now 32 , was deliberately provoking a discharge from the Air Force in order to challenge the military 's long-standing ban on homosexuals ( TIME , June 9 ) . Indeed , his lawyers hope the case will reach the Supreme Court and produce a landmark decision on homosexual rights comparable to the court 's historic school integration decision of 1954 . It is a perfect test case . The tall , red-haired sergeant has an impeccable twelve-year military record , no known psychiatric problems , and a Bronze Star and Purple Heart won on one of his three tours in Viet Nam . A five-man Air Force review board begins hearings Sept. 16 at Langley . <P> Matlovich is the son of an Air Force sergeant , and was raised at airbases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he was homosexual at the age of twelve , he did not act upon that knowledge till he was 30 , when he finally got up the nerve to go to a gay bar in Pensacola , Fla . Though Matlovich feared he would be raped by frenzied homosexuals , the bar turned out to be a civilized place filled with airmen , blue-collar workers and middle-class professional men . He lost his virginity that night to a government civil servant . Says Matlovich : " I had never held another person in my arms , never kissed another person since I was a child except for family . " <P> Though only dimly aware of the gay liberation movement , he ran across the name of Gay Activist Frank Kameny in a military magazine 's article on homosexuals . He flew to Washington , met with Kameny and Addlestone , and enthusiastically offered to challenge the military ban on homosexuals . The two men urged him to slow down and think about it . Matlovich did-for nine months-before writing his letter last March . <P> Since then , Matlovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( His parents prefer to think he is more interested in homosexuality as a cause than as a way of life . ) Addressing a Gay Pride Week rally in New York in June , he broke down and cried . Says he : " I found myself , little nobody me , standing up in front of tens of thousands of gay people . And just two years ago I thought I was the only gay in the world . It was a mixture of joy and sadness . It was just great pride to be an American , to know I 'm oppressed but able to stand up there and say so . They were very beautiful people out there .
