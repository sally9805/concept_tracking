excellence but we do find the vacuum part constantly confirmed . To which must be added that though we live in a vacuum we have a large fantasy life of nonvacu urn . We ? ' T is 1 , sitting at a desk in Washington who is fantasizing a we . Washington is 250 miles from Brooklyn , and downtown where the marble begins it is a different order of experience from Brooklyn . At least the newspapers and TV tell us that it is ; the reporters stand on the lawn of the White House and tell us regularly that the sky is falling down but that the President or perhaps Kissinger is busy propping it up . Their news always sounds important but then they are paid to make it sound important . Anyway they and the White House are miles away from my Washington , or from Brooklyn . I have n't for example saved the world from Hitler for nearly 30 years . Rosten 's hero wanders through life without money or power ( he is therefore almost automatically a " nice guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his wife yet still living in the same quarters with her ? how about that for a way of life ? Does this alienated pair fight , throw dishes , make passionate speeches of hate and then jump into bed and reenact happiness ? Not at all : they live in separate rooms , have a schedule for separatist use of the kitchen , and occasionally speak to one another in brevities like these : Brooklyn again . I like Brooklyn from a distance ? a distance I intend to keep ? and reading a book about Brooklyn is a way of keeping the distance . Norman Rosten 's new novel is a nice one in which I do get the feel of a Brooklyn I want to believe in . His Brooklyn is peopled by mostly amiable lost souls touching each other for brief moments then falling back into privacy . All meetings are casual . The dark issues of life may on occasion be discussed but they will be discussed on street corners and in dentist chairs , and they will only be discussed , not confronted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around Brooklyn savoring its dailiness while astronauts and other immortals dedicated to significant action cavort in the background , their accomplishments reported through the filters of newspaper and TV . Yes , I think Rosten has caught something important about America as well as Brooklyn , something hard to refute or argue with . Not that I want to argue . I would like sometime to do my own book about that America , from outside Brooklyn but not far out . Rosten 's hero 's ramblings reminded me of an assertion about the US made a long time ago by a mad Englishman , Wyndham Lewis , who said this country was a most " excellent vacuum . " He liked it for that , and wanted to come live here . We who ca n't help living in it are not so sure of its " How are you managing in that corner room ? " " Better than I expected . I made friends with a spider . And you ? " His closest relationships are with the casuals he meets on what he calls his appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traffic cop who tries to help him not to get tickets for parking on the Tuesday-Thursday side on Fridays , a famous poet who drops in for a few days and tells him how to live , a yoga girl , a cleaning woman . He is an unsuccessful writer ( of course ) and therefore out of America 's mainstream of business , except for an aberrant episode in the book where he sets out to be a paper salesman . Of course he fails . He then goes back to his appointed rounds , and the cleaning woman keeps asking him , " Have you finished that story yet ? " Of course not . So by temperament and by order of the fates he is obliged to remain a detached observer of life , a nice guy . At the end he gives us a poem that sums things up , about how difficult it is just to be human , and we leave him as he continues to struggle , wisely and humbly , with that . In other words the novel introduces us to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except what is primary . A Brooklyn even partially populated with such failures would be heaven . Su Negrin is not from Brooklyn but the Bronx . She is " a Bronx , white , working-class , childrened , 27 year old , Jewish , bi/gay-sexual , female , person . " Her book has no visible connection with Rosten 's , and the juxtaposition may seem frivolous . Yet reading the two of them within a day or two of each other I was suddenly struck that they were both statements about the good life ? and on that topic they were much further apart than the Bronx is from Brooklyn . Rosten 's man is never described as a liberated spirit ; he goes on his appointed rounds , he keeps being pushed through his days rather than muscling through on his own yet he does emerge as one who has explored the possibilities of liberation , of full humanity . Ms. Negrin on the other hand , a sort of professional liberationist , managed to convey , at least to me , the impression of someone moving away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that this impression is intended . She presents herself as a woman long liberated from her husband who is bringing up her children in a liberationist manner ( her book goes beyond women 's lib to children 's lib ? she gives her eight- and 1O-year-olds allowances and they take it from there , doing their own shopping , their own laundry , etc. ) and trying to be a liberated soul herself . The trouble is that she is chained to her theories ? at least as we see her in print ? so that she has no will or capacity to walk around her world , as Rosten 's man walks around Brooklyn , and let the dailiness seep in . Does she write of experience ? ? Hardly at all . She begins at start , as her title says , but to begin at start means to her not that she start with the sensed life but that she begin as an amateur **44;2360;TOOLONG and define the nature of man and tell us about ecology , exploitation , oppression , domination , expectation , objectification and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of her own felt life ? and she does , rarely ? the language barrier is so great that one can only dimly see her behind it . Sample : Being dominated feels like always wondering if I did the right thing . Being dominated feels like discovering that I never knew how a letter appeared when I hit the keys on the typewriter ( instant universe ) . Being dominated feels like worrying how I look when somebody 's coming over . Being dominated feels like singing along instead of singing . Being dominated feels like being depressed and not knowing why . Being dominated feels like needing someone instead of loving her . Being dominated feels like trying to correct my Bronx-Jewish accent . Such statements constitute her claims to be talking turkey rather than theory , and I agree that she does insert a considerable body of detail about her own life and person in the three pages she devotes to what " being dominated " means . But the trouble is that the idea ( domination ) dominates the detail . It does so syntactically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each fact to an abstraction . She ca n't let an event be an event , a rose a rose , even when she happens to descend to events or roses , which is seldom . Mostly she keeps herself in the upper stratosphere of liberationist thought , as in the passage below , which seems to me to be depressingly characteristic of current revolutionary thought : Utopia involves global wholeness , decentralization , diversity , human-scale , post-scarcity abundance , ecological soundness , col-lective orientation , individual control , authenticity , sensuality , synthesis , conflict , pleasure , hard work , interdependency , sadness , pleasure , intuition , laziness , contemplation , anger , bionics , good health , change , death , love , community , isolation , trust , ease , OKness , awkwardness , ecstasy . In traditional utopia the cost of getting rid of pain is a bland society devoid of pleasure . False choice number 36,784,278 . Once we stop being afraid of pain and pleasUre , I think we 'll be able to deal with the former and for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this religious shit propaganda that you have to take the bad with the good . So far it looks like we 've been getting only the bad and I ca n't say I 've seen people storming the government ( or the church ) in protest . People are afraid of pleasure ? that 's where it 's really at .. . I respect Ms. Negrin 's hopes for us , and I respect the ambitious small publisher that brought her book out . I would not only like to believe that we could " make it to utopia ... world-wide , right now , " as she says in her introduction , but that the utopia we choose would be a sort of permanent happy hour . But experience as well as the dictionary ( utopia ? " a place imaginary and indefinitely remote " ) suggests to me that we wo n't get all that ? that is , we wo n't get either the " traditional " utopia or the new happy one , but , at best , some poor human substitute like Rosten 's Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , I 'd rather be in Brooklyn anyway .
