DEATH ON THE NILE Directed by John Guillermin Screenplay by Anthony Shaffer <P> Death on the Nile is really very pleasant **28;4893;TOOLONG crafted by writer and director , wittily acted , most handsome in its photography , its period sets and costumes . These are all qualities not to be sneezed at in a time when both entertainment and professionalism in aid of amusement , that not very grand but very basic commodity , are in short supply at the movies . Perhaps it is because the picture comes so close to being something more than entertainment , comes close not to art but to something almost as rare-the genuinely delightful - that one comes away from it uneasily , vaguely disappointed . <P> The story , of course , is Agatha Christie 's : a closed-room , or rather a closed-ship murder mystery . The most significant victim is Linnet Ridgeway ( Lois Chiles ) , an heiress taking a Nile cruise for her honeymoon . As it develops , just about everyone in first class has both motive and opportunity to do her in . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hercule Poirot ( Peter Ustinov ) , pulled any triggers , and one can only spare the odd suspicious thought for Colonel Rice ( David Niven ) , who assists him in his investigation . But that leaves plenty of others : Bette Davis as a dowager with a taste for pearls of the sort the late-lamented sported ; Maggie Smith as her nurse-companion ; <P> Mia Farrow as the jilted lover of Linnet 's new husband ; George Kennedy as her American lawyer , trying to hide his raids on her assets ; Jack Warden as a doctor who feels Linnet has been slandering him ; and Angela Lansbury , who is about to lose a libel suit Linnet has brought against her . There are also a mistreated maid and a handsome young Communist who have their class differences to settle with her . <P> They are , manifestly , a diverse , and therefore amiable set of cruise companions , and unless one has read the book , it is impossible to break the case before Poirot does . The trouble with the thing is that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly stylized murder-mystery character , he seems to lack the energy to fill in the kind of details that can , in masterly hands , utterly charm and disarm . There are possibilities , for example , in the bickering of Davis and Smith , but they peter out . There are promising hints of giddiness in Farrow 's lovelorn posturings , but they too get lost in the toils of the plotting , and nothing much comes of doctor , lawyer or Communist . Even Poirot 's fastidiousness and egocentricity are not used to full comic effect , Shaffer electing to go for the easy , running gags that involve the traditional difficulties of the British with the French language and everyone 's insistence on confusing Poirot 's accent with his nationality-he 's Belgian , as he has to keep reminding them all . <P> Indeed , only Lansbury , taking matters into her own hands , staggering , grimacing , screeching , gets her full share of laughs . But given the rather muted surroundings , perhaps Guillermin would have been wise to sit on her if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast up to her dotty level .
