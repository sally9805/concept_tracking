Ever since the Washington Post broke the story of the CIA 's secret payments to King Hussein , it has been besieged by angry letters describing its action as " unpatriotic ... in the vilest taste ... the pinnacle of irresponsible journalism . " The Post was apparently disturbed enough last week by the outcry to call front-page attention to a curious story inside headlined : POST ATTITUDE " VERY RESPONSIBLE " IN WHITE HOUSE DEALINGS ON CIA STORY . This story quotes Jody Powell , the presidential press secretary , in support of the Post , though Powell did not deny that the President himself in private meetings with Cabinet and Congressmen had called the Post irresponsible . Where does that leave everybody ? <P> The issue of whether the press has a right to print Government-stamped " secrets " keeps bedeviling Government and journalism . It always will . High-minded , and sometimes high-flown rhetoric about the rights of the Government or of the press are heard ; there also exists the public 's right , and perhaps its duty , to be skeptical of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Woodward of Watergate fame ( who also broke the Hussein story ) describe their role in cat-mouse terms : it 's the Government 's job to keep secrets , the reporter 's job to ferret them out . Editorially defending its story , the Post sanctimoniously praised President Carter for insisting " that a much better effort must be made by the Government to keep its secrets-especially the CIA 's . " This really is n't satisfactory : even if the CIA were effectively keeping its secret , others who might be interested in leaking the story include Palestinian rebels , the Israelis , a disaffected official in the American or Jordanian governments , or the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , whose objection to the subsidy was overruled by Ford . Of course there are those like Columnist Tom Wicker who think that most secrets are dirty . Or those who think disclosure did no real harm , like Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee , who wonders " how good the Brave Little King 's intelligence is , anyway . And with that $210 million in aid he gets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' walking around ' money from the CIA ? " <P> To a man , editors feel burned by what they regard as odious past attempts to muzzle them in the name of national security . " Once something leaks out , it 's open season , " says Editor Tom Winship of the Boston Globe . " I always regret it when we 've played games . I got my head clear on the Pentagon papers . " Over at the New York Times , the Bay of Pigs lesson was well learned . At President Kennedy 's personal request , the Times did not print what it knew in advance of the invasion , only to be told afterward by a rueful Kennedy that had the story been published , the misbegotten adventure would have been canceled . The news suppression that angered Bradlee most was the bombing of Cambodia : " The people who were being bombed knew it , the Godless Commies knew it , only the American people did n't . In almost 20 years in a decision-making seat , I 've heard lots of claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one panned out . People are always trying to get me to be a statesman instead of a journalist . It 's fine work , but not what I chose . "
