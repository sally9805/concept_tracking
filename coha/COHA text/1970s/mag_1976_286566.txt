A prime goal of U.S. oil diplomacy over the past two years has been to break up the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . The U.S. tried to weld consuming countries into a bloc that would reduce oil imports and accelerate development of alternative sources of energy , with the aim of shrinking OPEC revenues enough to prod some of its 13 member nations to cut prices , thus dissolving the cartel . The strategy seemed justified : OPEC 's quintupling of prices since late 1973 has aggravated both inflation and recession in industrialized countries . But the attempt simply did not work , and now the policy is being quietly shelved . The U.S. Government has decided that it can not beat the cartel and that , as a result , it may just as well learn to live with it-perhaps even gain politically from its existence . Assistant Treasury Secretary Gerald Parsky sums up the new mood : " Breaking up OPEC would be detrimental to the direction in which we want to go . " <P> The softening U.S. attitude is prompted by several factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil-producing states would cripple the industrial world 's financial and production systems have proved unfounded . Most of the newly rich producers have become big spenders , and are creating lush export markets for U.S. , European and Japanese goods . <P> Much of the rapid rise in oil prices has already been absorbed by consumer countries . According to a recent study by the Brookings Institution , even with higher oil prices the growth of disposable income in the developed world will be slowed by only 3% or so between now and 1980 . <P> Then , too , the Administration has been unable to rally Europeans and the Japanese to its anti-OPEC strategy . They are far more dependent on oil imports than the U.S. and are exceedingly reluctant to annoy the producing states . <P> France has refused even to join the International Energy Agency , which the U.S. hoped would unite consumer nations in a struggle against OPEC pricing policies .

Non-OPEC producers like Canada and Mexico have also benefited from the towering cost of oil and are not about to press for reductions . <P> Moreover , OPEC has proved remarkably resilient because its members are well aware that their power to fix prices lies in their ability to maintain a united front . Thus cartel members have been able to hold traditional animosities in check-at least so far . Iran and Iraq managed to settle a long-smoldering border dispute , and radical Algeria fell in line behind Saudi Arabia 's moderate pricing policies when the Saudis presented Algeria with a generous loan . Un-gluing OPEC , if it could still be done at all , would require extraordinarily disruptive measures by the U.S. ; for example , actively fostering friction between such rivals as Iran and Saudi Arabia . <P> But experts fear that disruptive measures could lead to unpredictable turmoil , especially in the already explosive Middle East . That kind of strategy , says a State Department Middle East specialist , would be " so politically damaging as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
