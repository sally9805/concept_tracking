" They 're bloody sociable , and they 're fairer than English bosses ... We pay them back by pulling our weight . " <P> So says Lillian Gallagher , 41 , a British housewife who earns $50 a week as a packer at the Japanese-owned Y.K.K. zipper plant in Runcorn , 18 miles from Liverpool . Hers is a rare testimonial in Britain , where labor and management often seem less interested in pulling their weight than tearing each other apart . Yet in Runcorn the prevailing spirit is " All the way with Y.K.K. " - the corporate initials of Yoshida , the Japanese firm that is the world 's biggest zipper manufacturer . <P> Troubled by increasing costs and the three to six months ' time that it took to ship zippers from Japan to the United Kingdom , Y.K.K. in 1969 invested $3.5 million in a British plant . The gamble-it was the first direct Japanese manufacturing investment in Britain-has been a mighty success . The plant has never been hit by a strike or a slowdown . The 150 British employees ( there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unionization plan last year for fear that it might cost them their Christmas bonus . General Manager Hiroo Minami feels that there is basically no difference in performance between British workers and those in Japan . <P> Inside the plant , pop music throbs from loudspeakers while a multinational collection of American , West German , British and Japanese machines turn out 6,000,000 zippers a month . The machines whir under the usually watchful eyes of long-haired young men who are paid $66.25 a week and , as one of them puts it , " all the ale we can sink . " All men employees wear Y.K.K. 's jackets , which have the company initials proudly displayed on the breast pocket and no fewer than six zippers on the front , the pockets and the cuffs . <P> Japanese-style corporate paternalism is strong . Y.K.K. provides cut-rate bus service for employees , and Minami is forever throwing morale-boosting , all-hands-welcome parties at the Esso Motel in Runcorn . After work on Fridays , the Japanese make a point of dropping into Tanner 's Pub near the plant to socialize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What doing ? " - in good-humored imitation of their bosses ' awkward English . <P> Tommy Hughes , an 18-year-old machine operator , complains that the Japanese " have vile tempers . As soon as something goes wrong , no matter how small , they act like little kids . " But John Davies , 45 , who represents the employees on the plant 's Japanese-style " works committee , " renders the final verdict : " We asked to finish at 4:30 p.m. instead of 5 on Friday ; they gave us that . We asked for a Christmas holiday ; they gave us that . We asked for a sickness scheme , and they gave us that too . These Japanese seem to understand us . I would n't want to work for an English firm again . "
