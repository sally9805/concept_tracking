NRC shuts some plants <P> Ever since the near disaster at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island nuclear plant , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) has been debating whether to order the shutdown of other nukes designed and built by the same company , Babcock &; Wilcox . Some of the watchdog agency 's critics have had no doubts about what the NRC should do : they want a shutdown of all nuclear plants in the U.S. Cooler heads , however , pointed out that most of the plants have relatively good safety records . Besides , any major loss of generating capacity at the onset of the summer months-when electrical consumption soars-could cause intermittent blackouts around the country . <P> At week 's end , after several days of public agonizing and behind-the-scenes bickering with the utility companies , the NRC reached a Solomonic decision that was face-saving for everyone . It issued a shutdown agreement , but only after the utilities " voluntarily " offered to suspend operations at the nine B &; W plants , including Three Mile Island 's disabled reactor . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics that it is indeed a vigilant watchdog . <P> More important , under their pact with the NRC , the utilities consented to <P> 1 ) inspect their reactors for any flaws in design or construction that might be similar to those at Three Mile Island ; <P> 2 ) modify the emergency core-cooling systems ( which are designed to pour thousands of gallons of cooling water on a runaway reactor and thereby prevent The China Syndrome-type meltdown that was narrowly averted at Three Mile Island ) ; <P> 3 ) improve the training of plant technicians in safety procedures ; and 4 ) station a senior reactor operator in the control room at all times . <P> Earlier in the week , NRC Chairman Joseph M. Hendrie had gloomily warned that the shutdowns would have a " profound importance for our power supply . " For one thing , the utilities that own the B &; W reactors would be forced to buy electricity elsewhere for their customers . That would be costly . William Lee , chief executive of North Carolina 's Duke Power Co. , estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 million a month . But , under the compromise , these forecasts seemed somewhat alarmist . <P> Three of the plants-in Arkansas , Florida and Ohio-are already shut down for routine maintenance or refueling . So too are Metropolitan Edison 's two reactors at Three Mile Island : one because of the March 28 accident , its twin for refueling and maintenance . Thus the NRC 's order means an additional loss of only four nuclear plants-California 's Rancho Seco and Duke Power 's three Oconee reactors in South Carolina-out of 72 nuclear plants licensed to operate across the U.S. , including five on the East Coast temporarily shut for earthquake safety studies . All together , nuclear reactors produce about 14% of the nation 's electricity .
