Manhattan on the aisle <P> New York thrives between the pit and the pendulum . Theater attendance is up and so is the number of tourists who come to the megalopolis . This gas-shy summer will be no exception . Herewith , in alphabetical order , a ten-best list of attractions on and off Broadway well worth the high price of admission . Mind you , taste is a priceless democratic choice , and there are other shows that will reward a visit . <P> <P> A Chorus Line . Prior to this musical , dancers were a brigade of legs locked in animated unity . They have been as anonymous as gypsies , the theatrical term by which they are popularly known . This show probes their origins , their hopes , their dreads , their triumphs and why dancing was in the souls of their feet . <P> Buried Child . Of all younger U.S. playwrights , Sam Shepard is the ablest , a man whose work not only attests to his comedic talents but also bears the imprint of the home of the brave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country today sometimes seems to be neither brave nor free . <P> " Da . " Parents are the crucible of our lives . The coffin never confines them . They stalk our memories , govern almost all of our acts and can never be exorcised , will it as we may . Da , meaning dad , is what this salty Irish play is all about , and in the title role , Barnard Hughes is formidable and irresistibly jocund . <P> Father 's Day . Maybe the title should be Divorcee 's Day . Three highly articulate women ( Tammy Grimes , Susan Tyrrell , Mary Beth Hurt ) who have been ditched by their husbands indulge in distinctly inflammatory remarks about the male as s.o.b . Alternating between poignance and dipsy mirth , this drama takes a 20/20 look at divorce , U.S. style . <P> Getting Out . This is a tale of an orphan of despair , released from jail but not from the cage of her younger mutinous self . Balanced between torment and valiance , Susan Kingsley , an actress of kinetic authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A poem should not mean but be . " <P> Sweeney Todd . Not for the squeamish , since it is about cutting people 's throats , baking the fresh cadavers without delay and serving them up as meat pies . With Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou in peak performances , Sweeney Todd is a classic example of the remarkable virtuosity and range of the U.S. musical when it is in the hands of two flamboy ant masters of the stage , Director Harold Prince and Composer-Lyricist Stephen Sondheim . It is also the closest Sondheim has come to writing an opera , albeit dark , cynical and morbid in hue . <P> The Best Little Whorehouse in Tex as . No one who is out for an evening of fun will have a better time on all of Broad way . Racy in language but bawdily in nocent , the show is a treat in book , song and dance , and the choicest treat of all is Henderson Forsythe as the sheriff and Carlin Glynn as the madam . <P> The Elephant Man . Winner of both the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a man ( Philip Anglim ) grotesque in shape but al most saintly in spirit is the kind of the atrical experience that opens a window on the high cost , strange mystery and in effable blessing of human life . <P> They 're Playing Our Song . Ego is not a show-biz put-on . It is essential armor.
