THE WOMAN WARRIOR <P> by MAXINE HONG KINGSTON <P> 209 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> Exiles and refugees tell sad stories of the life they left behind . Even sadder , sometimes , is the muteness of their children . They are likely to find the old ways and old language excess baggage , especially if their adopted homeland is the U.S. , where the race is to the swift and the adaptable . Thus a heritage of centuries can die in a generation of embarrassed silence . The Woman Warrior gives that silence a voice . <P> Subtitled Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts , this astonishingly accomplished first book by an American-born Chinese woman haunts a region somewhere between autobiography and fiction . Yet it hardly matters whether the woman who tells ( or muses ) the book 's five stories is literally Maxine Hong Kingston . Art has intervened here . The stories may or may not be transcripts of actual experience . They are , unquestionably , triumphant journeys of the imagination through a desolation of spirit . <P> Brave Orchid .

Her new life consists of uneasy dealings with " Meter Reader Ghosts , Tree Trimming Ghosts , Five-and-Dime Ghosts . " She is even suspicious of her children , her daughter notes , " because we had been born among ghosts , were taught by ghosts and were ourselves half ghosts . " So she " talks-story " incessantly , trying to fill her daughter 's head with a usable past . <P> She tells the girl about Fu Mu Lan , a legendary woman warrior .

The role does not fit her new reality : " To avenge my family , I 'd have to storm across China to take back our farm from the Communists ; I 'd have to rage across the United States and take back the laundry in New York and the one in California . " There are other reasons why the old customs can not be embraced . She will not endure the subjugation of women they require : " When one of my parents or the emigrant villagers said , ' Feeding girls is feeding cowbirds , ' I would thrash on the floor and scream so hard I could n't talk .
