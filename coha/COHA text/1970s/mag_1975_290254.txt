The black gold at the end of Britain 's rainbow began flowing ashore from the North Sea for the first time last week . The victory over wind , sleet , 100-ft. waves and British muddle came on the 160th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo , and it sent Energy Secretary Anthony Wedgwood Benn into a fit of hyperbole as he opened the first valve on the Isle of Grain . Benn held aloft a souvenir bottle of the crude and announced to an assembly that included U.S. Ambassador Elliot Richardson : " This is much more significant and historic than the moon shot , which only brought back soil and rock . " <P> In one way , Benn 's analogy was not altogether farfetched . The technology of North Sea production is indeed impressive . But the prospective financial benefits are hardly enough to send Britons into orbit . The nation last year suffered a $9 billion payments deficit ; production from the small Argyll field off the east coast of Scotland-the first tapped-will lighten that load by only $140 million annually . The Argyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply a bare 2% of Britain 's oil needs . <P> Hopes are that by 1981 North Sea production will make Britain self-sufficient and by 1990 the nation will be one of the world 's top seven oil producers . Trouble is , the country has already in effect mortgaged much of its eventual oil income by borrowing abroad to maintain today 's living standards . A big slice of the oil money will be swallowed by repayment of foreign borrowings , which last year equaled a startling 5% of Britain 's gross national product .
