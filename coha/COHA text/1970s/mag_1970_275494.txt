He gives the kids free samples <P> Because he knows full well . <P> That today 's young innocent faces <P> Will be tomorrow 's clientele . <P> - Tom Lehrer <P> The ice cream man is part of pop Americana-jingling down suburban streets on summer afternoons or just after dinnertime , dispensing Tutti-Frutti and Frostee Shakes to flocks of neighborhood children . <P> Vendor Thomas George , 44 , was accustomed to sell such sweet delights at a neighborhood park in The Bronx . But the New York City police suspected him of peddling an illegal variation of the dreamsicle . Last week a patrolman staked out George 's truck and arrested him for allegedly selling heroin to a teen-aged customer . Police claimed that the Good Humor Man also had 81 horse-race betting tickets and eight more packets of heroin in his truck . Who is left whom little children can trust ?
