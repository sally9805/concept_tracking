It was a sad day for private enterprise . For the better part of 15 years , the two giant U.S. international airlines , Pan American and TWA , have been competing on roughly equal terms with a host of nationalized , subsidized foreign carriers ranging from Air France to Air India . But last week both Pan Am and TWA applied to the Civil Aeronautics Board for the first subsidies they themselves have received since the 1950s . In separate petitions , the two lines contended , in effect , that without federal help they will go broke combating two trends : a drop of about 5% in passenger traffic and , far more damaging , a breathtaking rise in jet-fuel bills that has raised the cost of refueling as much as 400% . <P> Pan Am , which carries 48% of America 's international air traffic , received its last subsidy in 1958 , a payment of some $200,000 for Latin American operations . Predicting a $374 million fuel bill for 1974 ( $204 million over the 1973 total ) , Chief Executive William Sea well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy . Seawell , who last year piloted his fleet into the profit column for the first time in five years , told the CAB : " We were overwhelmed in our efforts to stay in the black . " TWA , which unlike Pan Am has a far-flung network of domestic routes to supplement its international operations , has been off subsidy for 20 years and did not specify the exact amount of aid it seeks . Nonetheless , President Forwood C. ( " Bud " ) Wiser Jr . estimated a 1974 pretax loss , without subsidy , of $47.2 million , compared with a 1973 profit of $19.5 million . Together , the two lines ' applications could cost the U.S. Treasury about $300 million a year . <P> The two lines , along with Alitalia , have been considering a pooling of equipment and passengers on international flights . Pan Am applied last month for permission to discuss such an arrangement , and the CAB approved it last week . But the Justice Department formally objected on antitrust grounds ; the subsidy applications promptly followed . CAB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of federal financial assistance to U.S. international airlines to help them pay for excessive fuel costs , and legislation is pending in Congress to provide exactly that assistance . The only alternative appears to be outright nationalization.
