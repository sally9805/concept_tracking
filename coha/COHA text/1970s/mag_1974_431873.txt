 | Power and Light on a Lonely Land What to do ? or not do ? with its vast petroleum reserves has been the issue in Alaska and a concern of very many people in the Other 49 . The outline of the Alaska oil debate is by now familiar . For a long time it was suspected that there was oil under Alaska 's coastal plain . Eskimos and white explorers had noticed seeps in the area . In the mid-1960s the Atlantic Richfield Company began a serious search and in early 1968 drilled two successful wells at Prudhoe Bay . That summer ARCO announced the Prudhoe field held between five and 10 billion barrels of crude oil and 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . Oil firms are conservative when it comes to making public the size of reserves . Beyond scientific prudence , a certain amount of poor-mouthing is politic for financial and tax reasons and , one suspects , as a lever for managing public opinion . private estimate of most oilmen is that the Prudhoe recerve are in the neighborhood of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion barrels in the immediate area . Ho ever , even the original five-to-l0-billion figure would make the field the largest ever discovered in North America . A. hen operations begin , two million barrels are expected to be pumped out of Prudhoe daily . On the first full day of trading following the announcement of its Arctic oil strike ? a day when the Dow-Jones dustrial average suffered its biggest loss in a month ? ARCO stock increased in value by $370 million . Other oil companies rushed to the Arctic to conduct their own expirrations . In 1969 at a sale conductec by the state of Alaska these firms spent $900 million to secure oil leases to 450,0 acres near Prudhoe Bay . Crucial to the production plansthe leaseholders was the construction of an 800-mile-long 48-inch-diameter pipeline through which the oil from Prudhoe would flow across Alaska . The line would terminate at Valdez , a small port on an ice-free fjord opening onto the Gulf of Alaska . There the oil would be transferred to tankers . To build this $4.5-billion facility the oil companies formed the Alyeska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protecting nature from man , much of the debate centered on the Brooks Range . The most northerly , least inhabited mountain chain on the continent , it rises on the Pacific side of the state and extends across the top of Alaska , roughly parallel to the Arctic Ocean . The peaks of the range rise to 9,000 feet and are sharp and spectacular in conformation . The freeze in these mountains comes in September or early October , the thaw in May or June . Winter temperatures of - 60 ? are not uncommon . There is not much snow , but any that falls , stays . The mountains are buffeted by winds blowing off the polar seas . What lives in the Brooks Range lives precariously . In sheltered valleys and ravines there are thickets of stunted , warped willow and birch , but more t ical are tundra-type plants ? mosses. lichens , cranberries and creepers that exile in the few inches of acid soil lying c top of the permafrost .

Wolves hang the flanks of the caribou herds . There grizzlies that escape the worst of weather by hibernating or moving out . Red and Arctic foxes , weasels , gyr and peregrine falcons , owls , ravens , ptarmigan , hares , ground squirrels , voles and some smaller birds use part of the mountains part of the time . Men have coped with the Brooks Range as other species have by avoiding direct and prolonged confrontation with it .

Other factors complicated the issue and delayed the flow of oil . Several federal agencies , principally the U.S. Geological Survey , found the engineering data submitted with the pipeline proposal to be inadequate and asked that it be rethought and resubmitted . The land rights of Alaskan Eskimos and Indians also bore on the oil question . However , concern over the environmental propriety of the oil operation was an element in every one of these disputes . After initial surprise at the vehemence and effectiveness of the opposition , oilmen , supported by most Alaskan citizens and politicians , regrouped and fought back . They contended that the pipeline and tanker facilities in Valdez would occupy only 55 of Alaska 's 586,000 square miles ; that even in this small area the possibility of environmental catastrophe was slim ; that they , the operators and builders , would take precautions to prevent environmental damage . The basic pro-oil argument was that whatever the minimal environmental risks , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for petroleum products . As the fight continued , oilmen at times seemed to see themselves as Knights Templar defending civilization against the environmental Huns , whose objective was to attack conventional industrial-technological wisdom and morality . The oilmen 's attitude has its justifications . The Arctic oil debate has been a confrontation between two philosophies of life . For most environmentalists , an Arctic oil operation , no matter how safe , is undesirable . Better we should take the time , money and energy that will be invested in the oil and spend it to develop cheaper , more plentiful and less poisonous sources of energy . Better still , we should practice restraint , leave the oil where it is and develop a new life-style less addicted to fossil fuel , consumption , waste and material progress . The argument continues , though the immediate pri the pipeline permit , has been awarded to the Alyeska consortium . In the Far North men are readying their equipment for the spring construction season and in three years ' time the oil should be flowing to Valdez . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , somewhat like a city awaiting the arrival of occupation troops , Alaska waits in a mixed mood of anticipation , anxiety and exhausted relief for the coming of the oil . t , have brought in hunters , backpackand canoeists . They are dropped off with their nylon tents , down parkas , ze-dried foods and the best survival r modern technology can supply , oove on the wildlife , landscape and olation for a few summer weeks , and n are picked up and flown home . The trans-Alaska pipeline , as currently surveyed , will cross 75 miles of the Arccoastal plain , then ascend and cross e Brooks Range divide above Galbraith Lake . Descending the south slope it will angle westward , cross the headwaters of the Koyukuk River , reaching the Yukon about 350 miles north of Prudhoe and 50 miles north of Fairbanks . The few who have seen these lonely mountains and the large number who have enjoyed them vicariously because of the stories and pictures of others , fear that a pipeline will ruin this wilderness . They feel it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years on the mat of slow-growing vegetation ) , disrupt the caribou migration , harass rare birds , and make it easier to track and gun down sheep , caribou , bears and wolves . Above all , those who fear the pipeline believe that the steel tube throbbing with oil will violate the wilderness spirit of the Brooks Range , changing it from a virgin to a used place . To a considerable degree the Arctic oil debate began because there were sufficient people who valued these mountains as an undefiled wilderness and who believe that their value is at least as great as the value of 10 billion barrels of oil , which can be very tangibly measured in BTUs , kilowatts , mph and dollars . ATIGUN CANYON : This half-milewide defile is on the north slope of the Brooks Range . Through it , flowing out of Galbraith Lake , runs the shallow , swift Atigun River . The canyon runs east-west , which is unusual in the Brooks Range , the axis of which is also east-west . In consequence Atigun Canyon is relatively sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending upon the final survey , the transAlaska pipeline will be laid either through the canyon or across its mouth . For this reason Bob Waldrop and the Arctic Falcon thought Atigun would be the place for me to see something of the Brooks Range wilderness . Bob is an old friend who once was like a son or a very young brother . That was 15 years ago in the Appalachians when he was learning about white water , cliff climbing and cave crawling . He came to Alaska as a Sierra Club staffer and stayed as a kind off free-lance conservationist . During summers he guides adventure seekers and environmental dignitaries about the Brooks Range . This trip was the first we had taken together on which Bob was clearly in charge , an arrangement satisfying in a time-passes-but-itshould way . The Arctic Falcon , otherwise known as Shanahan , was our bush pilot . He favored an Atigun Canyon landing because there is a pipeline camp at Galbraith Lake ( pages 80-81 ) and a mile from the camp a cleared gravel strip , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Falcon could come to earth . Flying north , over mountains that look like a free-form pan of frozen meringue , the Falcon talked about engine seizures and crack-ups before setting down on the gravel Alyeska runway . He left us and soon we were edging around the northeastern end of Galbraith Lake toward the canyon . Considering the location , it was a beautiful day . The sun was bright , the sky blue and the wind calm . There were eight inches of granular , sandlike snow . The temperature was five below zero and except for our beards frozen with tobacco and nose drippings , skiing across the tundra was comfortable exercise . At first look the landscape is desolate ? an empty plain of snow overtopped by walls , spires and crags of black rock . Yet the first impression of sterility proves false . Life may not be plentiful but it is varied . A fox popped out of an ice crevice and cavorted , dancing , twirling and rolling across the snow , every now and then looking back . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au- dience . From a distance a stand of high brush seemed to be extending up and out of a hollow . In fact , it was a moving thicket of elaborate antlers , nine migrating caribou . South of the lake a caribou had been pulled down , killed by 14 wolves . There were even occasional flowers , a new species in the area , Arctic poppies ? strips of orange flagging flying from wooden stems driven into the tundra by pipeline surveyors . On the second day , well into Atigun Canyon , we saw Dail sheep . We also found an excellent camping place , a small ravine at a right angle to the river . Below some rapids there was an open hole in the ice from which we could draw water . At the head of the ravine there was enough scrub willow for two or three fires . The plan was to set up the tent , leave most of the gear in the ravine and , unencumbered by packs , spend the next few days wandering about the canyon . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . As we were unpacking , heavy clouds began to move in . By the time we had hollowed out a place in the snow for the tent , pitched it , cooked and eaten , the temperature was 15 below zero and the wind was blowing at a steady 30 miles per hour . We got into the tent , crawled into the sleeping bags and pulled our boots , extra clothing and food bags in after us . During the night the wind blew in tantrum-like gusts of 50 or 60 mph . The frail tent was an affront to the wind . It snarled , snapped and tore at the nylon all night . Such circumstances tend to simplify one 's desires . In the angry wind we did not worry very much about becoming rich or popular , or what Exxon or Arabs were going to do about the price of crude oil . The only thing that vitally concerned us was whether the tent would stand and what we would do if it did not . It stood . Thanks be for ripstop nylon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponts . The weather had not changed appreciably by morning . Short trips outside the tent proved that it was difficult to remain standing against the wind and in the blowing snow and general gloom , visibility was no more than 100 feet . We went back inside to wait out the storm . Such a wait is not as bad a way as it might seem to spend two days of your life . We were warm enough , swaddled in goose down , and every so often we would put 84 a block of cheese or a can of sardines next to our skin and keep them there til they were warm enough to chew . In a situation of this sort there things to be avoided . It is important spend as little time as possible outs the sleeping bag . Once outside you m be careful not to fall over guy ropes pee upwind . Excessive conversat should be avoided . There are no two ple in the world so interested in one other that they can lie for 40 hours si by side in a 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block of ice , and tertain themselves with talk . The th to do is to take some nice dense to for example " wilderness is the presen tion of the world , " and treat it like wedge of cheese under the armpit ? t is , warm it slowly and nibble on it . E ery now and then make a few sounds t let your friend know you are content and harmlessly occupied . Thus : 10 a.m. : " If he had been a literate g pro , he would have said golf is the preservation of the world . It 's like Carroll Quigley , the historian , says ? if Freud had been an Eskimo he would have decided the whole world was motivated bs walrus blubber . Wilderness has been a good game for us , but there 's no reason it has to be everybody 's game . " " Aha . " " History is a record of people trying to get out of places like this , trying to come in from the cold , get out of caves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that wilderness is the peril of the world . It is what has been snapping at our heels like a wolf at a caribou . Maybe trying to get warm but never making it the whole way is our preservation ; if we get so warm we forget what it 's like outside , then we lose the world and ourselves . " 6 p.m. : " You know those bumper stickers in Anchorage that the pro-oil people put out : LET THE BASTARDS FREEZE IN THE DARK ? " " Aha . " " We are the bastards they have in mind . " " We need oil . " 2 a.m. : " We are like Romans taking auguries from chicken intestines . " " Aha . " " There are all these questions of seeming interest : oil and tundra , ARCO and  | Sierra Club , pipeline and caribou , wolves and gas rationing . So we pick up and say , Hang on , gang , while we go out and have a meaningful experience . We 'll come back and tell you what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go off like a shot to lie on a sheet of ice and commune with a blizzard . Or maybe we are more like those Pawnee who used to run rawhide ropes through slits in their chests and have themselves hung up on a pole so they could stare at the sun until they saw God . " " Nothing great is achieved without suffering . " ALYESKA CAMP : On the second morning the storm abated and it was possible to pry the tent and packs out of the ice and snow , load up and ski out of the canyon to the Alyeska camp on the far side of Galbraith Lake . The pipeline camp is one of 21 that will serve as bases for the 13,000 construction men who will be employed once work begins . At this time Galbraith Lake was an advance outpost being held by 20 or so maintenance men , surveyors , helicopter mechanics and pilots who were waiting for the construction offensive . The camp boss was Ted , a hard , feisty , bandy-legged ex-saddle bronc rider from Montana . Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stragglers from the Great Outdoors . " Jesus Christ . What the have you been doing out in those miserable badlands . I ought to leave you out there , let you freeze some more so you can keep on enjoying nature . That 's what you 'd like , is n't it ? You 're some of those eachologists , are n't you ? " " I 'm a spy . I go around and do loyalty checks in crummy places like this . " " eachologists . You want us to feed you and keep you warm and then you 'll go off and tell everyone what s.o.b.s we are . How long you going to hang around here ? " " Until Shanahan picks us up . " " Then we 're going to have you for a while . Even the Falcon ca n't get in in this weather . Go find the cook and tell him to give you a room and put you on the chow list . Hey , Lash , how about it . We 're going to have us a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married or what ? " In fact , Ted was not an s.o.b . He was a pugnacious , quick man with some fairly strong negative feelings about the mystique of the wilderness . There being noth- ing more unseemly than contentious guests , we talked about bucking horses , Pendleton , Casey Tibbs and passed the time easily . The Galbraith Lake camp was a collection of a dozen or so prefabricated bunkhouses ( mostly empty and sealed ) , an assortment of machine shops and maintenance sheds clustered around the gravel helicopter pad . Behind the buildings , like Conestoga wagons drawn up around a pioneer camp , were ranked files of formidable construction machines : 35 vans and pickups , 22 graders , 12 dump trucks , nine trailer tractors , seven drilling rigs , five front-end loaders , two tankers , two cranes , two shovels . The equipment had been there for at least a year , hauled in during the winters of 1971 and 1972 over an ice road from Fairbanks . , " said a Galbraith Lake electrician , waving his hand at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were going to build this pipeline no matter what those ? environmentalists might have thought . Those wheeler-dealers who sent all this stuff up here did not bring it up to give to the caribou . " The logic behind this point of view ? that come heaven , hell or injunctions , Big Oil was going to get its pipeline ? is not hard to follow . That the Galbraith Lake camp and others were being built on the tundra while politicians , lawyers and academics supposedly were conducting a public debate about what should or should not be built on the tundra tends to set one thinking cynically . Oil spokesmen , of course , explain things differently . They say that in the interest of bringing the benefits of more oil to the people as soon as possible they have already invested well over a billion dollars in the Arctic operation . That this investment , the Galbraith Lake men , front-end loaders , etc. should have sat idle for three years while the citizenry was arguing about whether it wanted to be so benefited has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodhearted oil people . Beyond its existence and substance , perhaps the most surprising thing about Galbraith Lake is that this camp 200 miles on the far side of the Arctic Circle may be , in terms of creature comforts , one of the coziest places in which an American man could winter in 1973-74 . The living quarters are comfortable and convenient after the antiseptic fashion of a Holiday Inn . The buildings are to toasty . The food is magnificent in calorie cholesterol style , running to steaks , chops , hams , slabs of bacon . milk , eggs , fruits , vegetables , salads . loads of warm pies , cakes and past One midnight after a hard day of suming five Travis McGee mysteries . urge came for a little exercise , a s from the recreation lounge to the di room . The camp was asleep . The sounds were the hum of a generator soft music from a stereo whose o had been overtaken by sleep , rising falling with snores . In the bright , s less dining room the coffeepot was its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cookies , doughnuts , s rolls , apples , oranges and bananas . For some reason it was the bans that seemed to be bursting with significance , like a complicated dream or mystic 's point of flame . It was as if t had never been such an exquisite symbol of human ingenuity as a giant pile bananas lying on a spotless table in stuffy room on the north slope of the Brooks Range . For a surrealistic moment the bananas seemed balanced on the great mountain of labor , energy and calculation that brought them up from Costa Rica . The bananas served as a catalyst for thought . Every species has a kind of biological heartland , a niche in which it is well adapted to live by using the resources found there . Changes in the environment created by inanimate forces or by the activities of competitive creatures may drive the species out of the heartland into the margins of its range , where survival may be possible for a time but is difficult . More commonly , creatures become too numerous and compete with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the margins . White-tailed deer have provided examples of this phenomenon . A few good years , in terms of population growth , may be followed by several terrible ones . The inflated population will exhaust the depleted resources , stripping forage from the land , even digging out the roots of plants . Then the herds will move into marginal places ? swamps , heavily shaded forests , upper elevations ? where they must use increasing amounts of energy to obtain decreasing amounts of food . A sign of their predicament is something @#  | called a browse line . A browse line is created in a forest at about the height of an adult deer 's jaws , if the deer is standing upright on its hind legs . Below the line roots , leaves , stems , bark , even small branches will be stripped bare by the desperate animal . Sometimes a species will be overwhelmed by the hardships of marginal existence and will disappear from the area , or disappear forever , everywhere . More commonly , the crisis will drastically reduce the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will linger on in enfeebled circumstances until such time as the heartland resources are replenished by natural processes . No matter what the outcome , dependence on marginal habitat is invariably a sign of a species in trouble . Individuals , in search of stimulation or by accident , may wander into the hinterlands , even live there , but substantial numbers of a species appear in the margins only because of blight of one sort or another in their home territory . The north slope of the Brooks Range always has been exceedingly marginal so far as humans are concerned . This is obvious on top of an ice sheet in a nylon tent in a storm in Atigun Canyon . It is less obvious in a Galbraith Lake pipeline camp insulated by conveniences and comforts , but it may be no less true . Awesome amounts of effort and energy were expended to get all those things to the tundra and keep them there at the end of a long , complicated , vulnerable lifeline . A pile of Costa Rican bananas on the banks of Galbraith Lake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of man . But it is also possible that the bananas are the equivalent of a human browse line , an obvious sign that there is trouble in the heartland . PRUDHOE BAY : When it is operative , the Prudhoe Bay field will occupy about a quarter of a million acres between the multichanneled mouths of the Sagavanirktok and Kuparuk rivers . This is delta country , a flat , frozen plain of gravel and silt washed down from the Brooks Range . Wells 9,000 feet deep are needed to reach the oil , which lies under gravel and 2,000 feet of permafrost . In comparison to others , the Prudhoe reservoir is considered a shallow , easily accessible one since a 13/4-mile drill is now commonplace for oilmen . The field is leased by 11 firms . However , two of these companies ? ARCO and British Petroleum ? because of the size of their holdings and degree of their interest have been designated as the field operators . They will work and manage the field , while the other participants in the consortium will share expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudhoe has been divided in half , an East Section to be operated by ARCO and the West Section which will be BP country . The substantial involvement of British Petroleum ( 48% of whose stock is owned by the British government ) in the Alaska oil operation has given rise to some chauvinistic sniping . A principal argument advanced by oilmen was that the Prudhoe field must be opened to make the United States less dependent upon foreigners for fossil fuel . The major role of BP in the Arctic , as well as persistent rumors that much of the British oil produced in Alaska will be sold in Japan , has tended to turn this argument back against the oilmen . Presently ARCO and BP have drilled some 60 wells at Prudhoe . All but one , an ARCO well being used to supply on-the-spot energy for base operations , have been capped . It is estimated that 180 to 200 wells will be needed to pump out the oil at the **25;1236;TOOLONG rate that has been projected . The drilling of new wells is waiting on the trans-Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil . As yet no provision has been made for transporting the 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas associated with the Prudhoe oil . Two competitive gas pipeline companies are drumming up support for their projects and routes ? one through Canada , the other through Alaska ? but until this matter is settled natural gas released in conjunction with the oil drilling will be pumped back underground , stored in the field itself . About 100 miles of gravel road , two airstrips and docking facilities on the Beaufort Sea have been built and much of the material needed for the oil operation has already been delivered . ARCO has in place its first flow station , an intricate , computerized facility that will separate oil from gas , monitor the flow and send the oil to the pipeline inlet . Also on location at a yard two miles south of the ocean is a great pile of madein-Japan steel pipe , which when welded 88 together will make up the northernmost 168 miles of the oil line . ARCO has the most elaborate b. : camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate 200 e ployees and can be expanded to service 500 . Not inappropriately , considering comforts and luxuries , it is called t ARCO Hilton . However , the AR ( base camp soon will lose its distinctly . as the showplace of the Far North . Br ish Petroleum has nearly completed i compound , a very cool glass and st structure that will feature a swimming pool , ball field and a live , 40-foot spru tree in the lobby . The BP tree , alrea in place , has been named the Prudh Bay National Forest . Some of the Prudhoe material has been flown in but the bulk of its 290,000 tons ( at $125 per ton in shipping rates ) has been brought in by sea on barge trains that operate frantically during the fi e ice-free weeks of midsummer . No one has calculated , or at least announced the results of any calculations , as to how much energy has been used to bring pipe from Japan , computers from New York and bananas from Costa Rica , to this ultimate margin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coals-toNewcastle operation , a lot of East Texas . Venezuelan and Arabian oil having been burned preparatory to getting the Arctic oil . It has been estimated that once the oil begins to flow out of Prudhoe . some 5% of the fossil fuel extracted will be used to send it from the Beaufort Sea to Valdez . THE SPECTACLED EIDER DUCK : Lloyd Madson grew up around the California fields and says he never gave much thought to any line of work other than the oil business . An ARCO supervisor , he has been at Prudhoe for more than three years . Madson was sent north as a construction boss , and has become the resident expert on environmental regulations . He tells a story : " Last year some of the boys found this duck . It was a peculiar-looking bird with white patches around its eyes like it was wearing goggles . It seemed pretty sick . We brought it in and put it in a box to keep it warm and got it to eat scraps from the kitchen . The bird got stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somebody said this one must have missed the migration because it was sick . So we crated it up and put it on the plane  | for Anchorage , but the ducks had left there , too , so we sent this one on down to Seattle . Some of our people took it outside the city to a sanctuary and let it go . A little while later a ranger tells us this was a spectacled eider duck , a kind that does n't really migrate and very seldom gets south of the Aleutians . So there that poor bastard was , about 2,000 miles from home . But we sure as hell tried . " Madson tells the story as a joke on himself and the others at Prudhoe Bay . But beyond their dumbness about ducks , the point of the story is that oilmen have become jittery to the point of silliness about charges of environmental insensitivity . This was not always the case . In the beginning the feeling was that the only people who could possibly object to pumping Prudhoe oil were a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , one Henry Pratt , not an oilman per se but a strong oil supporter who happened to be the executive assistant to the then Governor of Alaska , Keith Miller . Regarding oil and Alaska , Pratt once was moved to declare publicly , " Hell , this country 's so goddamn big that even if industry ran wild we could never wreck it . We can have our cake and eat it , too . " Nowadays oilmen and their associates would no more say what Pratt did than sing dirty lyrics to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas . They have learned that if their opponents are lunatics , they are numerous , articulate and , when it comes to political and legal infighting , crafty . It is stupid to stir up these passionate people with gratuitous one-liners about eating cake . The oil industry is currently projecting , by soft words and good deeds , an image of environmental responsibility . Back in Los Angeles at ARCO headquarters there is a new environmental department . It is supervised by molders-of-publicopinion types but includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , idealistic young women . ARCO also has hired Angus Gavin , a naturalist , and sent him to Prudhoe Bay to see what effect oil operations ml caribou . Very briefly , Gavin ed that the operations will have verse effect on the animals . N but impossible to come out of installation without a copy of t report . Alyeska , the pipeline builder . drawn portions of its survey to ological and archaeological ra it also has a nature squad , a inspectors who will fly the route sure the job is as environmen as possible . Pipeline and oil offices , even vehicles , are festooned posters and stickers , the pu which is either to announce that respect the environment or to men to respect the environment . Oil spokesmen suggest that in fashion the industry loves Mot as well as anyone and that left to devices Big Oil would have t Arctic lands gently . This may be as a result of the Arctic oil debate ber of restraints have been placed  | operators , designed to make them behave . State and federal regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to permafrost , tundra , watersheds , marine estuaries , Arctic flora and fauna , native populations , archaeological sites , etc . It may prove , as some environmentalists fear , that these restrictions are not suf. - ' efficiently stringent , but in general they represent more concern than has ever before been expressed for the impact of major engineering project on the environment . Also specified are how the producers w ill be punished ( principally by fines , indemnities and work stoppages ) if they % iolate , by accident or design , the stipulations . Already a company with a contract to clean up after some of the preliminary Prudhoe Bay construction has been sued for S150,000 for allowing its vehicles to cross and disfigure a mile and a half of out-of-bounds tundra . The feeling among the producers is that unless they police themselves carefully there will he more of this ; that the multi-billiondollar oilfield and pipeline projects will attract S15,000-a-year land managers , pollution sleuths and naturalists as a caribou does wolves and that these inspectors will be eager to expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clubs oilmen muse about the cost of the whole environmental ball of wax : of keeping levies of P.R . men , lawyers and plant ecologists ; of laying down roads and pipelines , not necessarily where and when it is most convenient ; of designing , installing and operating anti-spill , anti-earthquake , anti-pollution systems ; of letting several billion dollars of leases , equipment , facilities and men stand idle while the environmental proprieties were debated . Offhand estimates are that these and other things will run up the cost of producing Arctic oil by 2% to 10% . At the moment this is speculation , but inevitably the oil industry will itemize these costs ? " Services : three caribou watchers " " Preserving : two aboriginal hunting camps . " A total will be brought down and included on the old expense account , which will be presented to and paid , unless the world has gone to hell , by everyone who buys Arctic oil . The price of the oil will be X ( the traditional , let-'errip production costs and profits ) plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equation the Y is the figure placed on the value of at least part of the Arctic wilderness . It is the price we are willing to pay to protect it . It is also , since oilmen are our agents , the figure for which we are willing to sell this portion of the wilderness . AN OILMAN : Bill Walters is ARCO 's Prudhoe Bay field coordinator ; that is , he is the boss of operations at the camp . Technically he is the field boss half the time , since ARCO rotates its employees on weekly and biweekly schedules . One group of men is flown home to Anchorage , Fairbanks or Point Barrow , while another crew is brought in . A big , dignified Oklahoman , Walters has spent his adult life in oil . He is not the kind of man who is going to call anyone a  - -  eachologist or tease about throwing him out in the snow . In the first place , that is not his nature or style . In the second place , during the long waiting period at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain and explain the operation to visitors , many of whom , if not eachologists , have not been knee-jerk pro-oil people . Walters is effective in this part of his job . He is unabashedly an oilman and does not find it necessary to offer tortuous excuses to justify accepting his ARCO paycheck . He gives the impression that he regards his line of work as being as rational , constructive and dignified as , say , courting voters , exploiting the law or telling stories for pay . Walters says , yes , he feels that in the Arctic oil debate substantive points were raised by the environmentalists . However , they may have continued to raise them long after everyone admitted they were substantive . In this way the debate unnecessarily delayed oil production and may raise oil prices . In general , the best thing environmentalists have done is make everyone aware that natural resources are finite . On the other hand , it is clear that man , like any other animal , needs to consume resources . Until something better comes along , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping oil from Prudhoe will cause environmental havoc because : 1 ) the oil operation will occupy such a small portion of the land ; 2 ) getting oil is a relatively clean extractive operation . A well shaft goes deep underground but it affects only a small surface area . In comparison to highways , railroads and jetports , a pipeline is also relatively innocuous . In the United States there are hundreds of miles of pipeline going through and under farms , forests and recreation areas . The lines do not foreclose other land uses and most people are not even aware that they are there ; 3 ) the oil operators have taken extraordinary pains to design the Arctic operation so that environmental risks will be reduced to an absolute minimum . " You have probably heard the argument that no matter how safe the t ansAlaska operation is , it will still ruin the Brooks Range , simply by being there . " " Yes , I have heard that and 1 do n't really know how to answer it rationally because it is not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles away , something he ca n't see or hear or smell or otherwise sense , is going to ruin a man 's experience , then I suppose there is n't much that can be done about it . He will suffer . I wonder how many people there are like that . You have seen that country . It is very scenic but it is very hard to get into and harder still to live in once you are there . I suspect maybe only a hundred or so people venture into the Brooks Range in a year . They are exceptional people , active and affluent . I do n't doubt that this form of recreation is important and satisfying for them . 1 doubt , however , that their pleasure should be given priority over the real need of millions of people . " " Do you think wilderness has any general value ? " " I think it has considerable value . I am not as active as I once was but on our vacation my wife and 1 very much enjoy visiting wilderness areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we as a people value them is that we spend a lot of money and labor to preserve these areas . We have rangers managing our forests , improving their vigor , protecting them from fire . We cut trails , establish camp areas so that they can be enjoyed by larger numbers . Actually I think a long-term benefit of the oil operation here at Prudhoe is that it may open some of the state 's vast wilderness areas so that more people can enjoy the experience that our environmental friends tell us about . " SIERRA GO HOME : These words appear on a bumper sticker often seen on Alaskan highways . It reflects the belief that by now oil would have been flowing , and riches , too , were it not for the i  | activities of outside agitators among whom Sierra Clubbers are thought to be archetypical . Debbie is the kind of person the exhibitors of his bumper sticker have in mind . After graduating from the University of California she worked in San Francisco at the Sierra Club 's national headquarters . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some backpacking north of the Yukon . In the spring of 1973 she got a job guiding hiking parties in the Brooks Range . When the freeze came she moved to Fairbanks and found a job as a cocktail waitress , which enabled her to stay in Alaska waiting for the next season of skiing , packing and climbing in the Arctic mountains . Debbie is of a type , though a fairly small , rare one . It is composed of thirtyish people , for some reason more often women than men , who were very much caught up in the restless youth movement of the mid-1960s . They seem to have been purified by the acid tests of those days rather than driven into radical chic or cynicism as so many of their contemporaries were . They are articulate , passion- ate people who have turned to a kind of gentle , clinical humanism and are preoccupied with living virtuous private lives ? who seen to be forever examining their own actions to determine whether they are sufficiently honest , open and tender . In many ways the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitresses but for our times . Having come across one , a person would be a damn fool to ask her to go home . The Debbies vary , of course , but many of them are cut along the lines of this Debbie , tall and straight . She has straight features , straight hair , straight clothes , is a straight talker , a straight woman . " This is how the Brooks Range affected me , " she said . " In the beginning I was frightened , not at all sure that I could take care of myself and not get lost or mauled by a bear . Then gradually I found that I could get along , that there was more to me than I thought , and this , of course , gave a great lift to my pride . After that came the feeling that I was super @# II 111111,1111 @# sensitive , very aware of everything around me , of what I was and might be . I was excited by the rare and unusual things I was seeing , feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explain it any better than to say I experienced joy in the Brooks Range . Others seem to undergo the same metamorphosis . " " But can you equate this ephemeral state that a few can experience with the practical benefit oil has for many ? " " Well I 'm not so sure about those practical general benefits . The people who are going to benefit are those who make a lot of money from oil , and I do n't think there are more of them than backpackers . The oil people say , Look , we have a shortage , we are going to have to live in colder , darker houses , drive less and slower . If we open up Alaska , strip the coal of Wyoming , do some other things , we can go back to the good old warm , bright days . ' This is like an addict looking for another fix . It may be easy but I am not sure it is practical . If we got less oil and used less , we would @#  | certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so easy , we would find something better to do with ourselves than getting our kicks by turning on switches . " They say they will pump the Prudhoe field dry in 30 years . Maybe the most practical thing would be to leave it there for now . Maybe we will find better energy or that we were living better without as much oil . But even if none of this turned out to be right , if we could n't kick the oil habit , then it would still be there and we might need it more in 2004 than we do now . " " You 've heard it , maybe you invented it , that the pipeline will ruin the idea of the wilderness , even if it does n't do much physical damage . " " I did n't invent it , but 1 feel that way . You 've been in Atigun . You know it would n't be the same place if all you had to do was park your car and walk in 15 minutes from the road . If it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . But they are talking about building a sec-@# ond pipeline from Prudhoe and there will be gas lines . There is going to be a road along the pipeline and that may be the worst thing of all . People are going to drive in to see the scenery and have a little adventure . They are going to need service stations and restaurants , johns , motels , campgrounds , trails , side roads . am not knocking it . Central Park is a kind of wilderness for a lot of people and a good thing to have . Yellowstone and Yosemite are another kind of experience . But it is a bad thing if this is all we can afford to have . It is a kind of continuum . At one end may be Central Park and toward the other something like the Brooks Range where you have to work to get in , test your body and mind to have the kind of joy I was trying to tell you about . Not many people can have that kind of experience at any one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and in the future , can potentially have the experience . If it is messed up it is gone forever . There will be no opportunity for anyone to experience that kind of pleasure . We will have to do without it and I do n't think that is progress . It will mean that we are poorer than we are now . ' THE SECONDARY HIGHWAY : From Fairbanks south to Valdez pipeline construction crews will , for the most part , utilize existing highways . To the north , between Fairbanks and Prudhoe it will be necessary to build 400 miles of new road that will roughly parallel the pipeline . One of the stipulations attached to the pipeline agreement is that Alyeska must build its construction road to meet specifications of a secondary highway . When the oil begins to flow , Alyeska must turn this road over to the state , which thereafter will maintain it . " The stipulation requiring a secondary highway was not our idea , " says John Ratterman , Alyeska 's public affairs director in Anchorage . " When construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipeline to oversee it and operate pumping stations . We plan to supply our crews by air . We @#  | have no need for the road and as a public highway it could cause problems for us . If the world were different , I would like to see development north of the Yukon barred . But with the world as it is , we need oil resources , and the pipeline is justified in terms of the greatest good for the greatest number . The road may be a different matter . I think a public road through the Brooks Range will significantly increase the pressure on wildlife from hunters . Northern Alaska is not Africa . Big-game populations are relatively small and because of the harsh conditions they do not replenish themselves rapidly . I am sure other examples of what impact a road and increased use might have on a fragile environment will occur to you . " Bruce Campbell is the Alaska State Highway Commissioner , a veteran politician with the moves and manner of such . " Was there any particular pressure from sportsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to take over the Alyeska road ? " " Not in any organized way . It just seemed to most people that in a state as underdeveloped as ours it made good sense to promote a major addition to our highway system when the opportunity presented itself . Great numbers of our citizens live 100 miles or more from the nearest road . I am sure the highway will be beneficial for many of the groups you mention . The mining industry has not had much incentive to develop in the Brooks Range because there has been no economical way to get ore out . The road will presumably open new areas for your average recreational hunter . There will be tourist use . A lot of people who drive their campers and trailers up from Iowa and places like that are going to see this road on a map and they are not going to be able to resist heading north and dipping their hands in the Arctic Ocean . It will be the only road on the continent that gives them that opportunity . " A SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , 60 miles northwest of Fairbanks . It is located on Minto Flats , a forested drainage plain on the south side of the Yukon . The pipeline will cross the Tanana and Tatalina rivers , the Globe , Washington , Chatonika and Gold creeks , all of which empty into Minto Flats . Richard Frank has been Second Chief of Minto and the representative of his people at fede hearings . He says : " The people of Minto depend U on the food that we hunt a trap and fish . We have moose and ra bit and ptarmigan , and we have wild ries , blueberries and what we call hi bush berries . " We get up in the morning and a on the trail by about 6 a.m. looking fresh moose tracks . After you 've wouneed a moose you have to stick with hint : until you get him even if it takes a week The first thing our children look for when we come home is blood on our moccasins . If there 's none , they know that you came back empty-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been fighting to protect out - land for a long time . Ten years ago there were plans to put a road into Minto Flats for the sole purpose of sports hunting and sports fishing . This road was going directly into the hunting region of the Minto people . We finally got the opportunity to appear in Fairbanks and this road was ' not built . With today 's pipeline we are faced with something a thousand times more serious . If we had a spill in the pipeline it would pollute the waters and the lakes and therefore would hurt the animals that live on these lakes and waterways . If you kill off all the animals , they can not be rebuilt . The land that 's been damaged by oil can not be rebuilt . These are the things that we fear would be lost forever . " In 35 years or so an ancient phenomenon , the great pool of oil that has lain under the permafrost for longer than man has been man , will disappear into heat , light , speed and smog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extractive operation will produce an intricate network of cause and effect , changing land and life . ( We might have left the oil where it was , and this , too , might have set in motion formidable waves of change . ) In the Arctic oil debate there was much talk about values ? of oil , of wilderness , of consumption , of self-restraint . All value talk can be reduced to expressions of prejudice and personal interest because we do not really know whether a man should have moose blood or oil stains on his boots , whether he should be in Central Park or Atigun Canyon . We can not assess change because the basic puzzle of humankind remains unsolved . We do not know ? and have never known ? what man should be .
