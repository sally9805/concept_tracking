It has been a traditional American belief that doing well in school can help even the poorest and most culturally disadvantaged child achieve economic success . But can it ? Not according to Harvard Sociologist Christopher Jencks . In a book to be published next month , Inequality : A Reassessment of the Effect of Family and Schooling in America ( Basic Books , Inc. ; $12.50 ) , Jencks asserts that schools do almost nothing to close the gap between rich and poor . Moreover , he argues , the quality of the education that public elementary and high school students receive has little effect on their future income . <P> That conclusion alone would provoke angry debate among educators , but in reaching it , Jencks makes many other astonishing assertions as well . His book seems destined to be the most controversial educational topic of the season , despite its jargon-laden prose and myriad detailed footnotes . " A fact for nearly every occasion , " quips Jencks , and he adds cheerfully : " I think it 's safe to assume that we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his data from the survey of 4,000 public schools and 645,000 students directed by Johns Hopkins Sociologist James Coleman , who concluded in 1966 that the quality of a school has little to do with how well its students learn . Jencks agrees . " The character of a school 's output depends largely on a single input , namely the characteristics of the entering children , " he writes . " Everything else-the school budget , its policies , the characteristics of the teachers-is either secondary or completely irrelevant . " <P> In fact , Jencks believes that schools " serve primarily as selection and certification agencies , whose job is to measure and label people , and only secondarily as socialization agencies , whose job is to change people . " The reason , he says , is that schools can not control the factors that most determine test scores : heredity and home environment . Jencks believes that genes play a significant role in determining IQ , though he does not assign to them the overwhelming importance found by Berkeley Psychologist Arthur Jensen . Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to learn , says Jencks . Genes also affect the environment in which a child develops , a factor ignored by traditional methods of estimating genetic influences . " If , for example , a nation refuses to send children with red hair to school , the genes that cause red hair can be said to lower reading scores . This does not tell us that children with red hair can not learn to read . " <P> Jencks ' book particularly challenges all of the nostrums that have been tried over the past decade in an effort to make educational opportunity equal in America . He finds no reason to believe that spending more money will greatly improve the quality of schooling . As evidence , he reports that children who attend elementary schools with high budgets probably gain no more than a five-point advantage on standard tests over those enrolled in low-budget schools . Differences among public high schools affect their students even less . " Almost every high school has some dropouts , some students who take a diploma but do not attend college , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation between schools , the ratio of those groups to one another is now about 1 to 2 to 2 , according to Jencks.
