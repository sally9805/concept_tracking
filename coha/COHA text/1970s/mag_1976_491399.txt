Since 1962 , Victor Lasky has been writing a syndicated newspaper column , which currently reaches some 100 newspapers . His books include the much-discussed J.F.K. : The Man and the Myth , and Say , Did n't You Used To Be George Murphy ? He and his wife live in Washington , D.C. , amid much swirling political conjecture . Las  --  ky keeps in touch with Richard Nixon and is presently engaged on a book project " taking a new look at the whole Watergate situation . " He once said that the memory of his parents ' capacity to with-stand repeated adversities " has certainly held me together at times when I have been under great pressure . " " And , " added Richard Nix  --  on , " it always will . " That was said years ago , long before Watergate drove him from the highest office in the land . His parents ' example served him in good stead during that prolonged crisis . Never be  --  fore in the history of the Re  --  public had any man , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease  --  less campaign of vilification and defamation . Never before had any elected official been so thoroughly investigated . He was stripped and humiliated in public . Even his psyche was probed without letup , and ama  --  teur analysts questioned his sanity . But whatever you think of Mr. Nixon , whether you like or dislike him , trust or distrust him , the fact remains that the former President emerged from his unparalleled ordeal with a poise and dignity even his more virulent detractors must grudg  --  ingly concede . And no longer do you hear stories about his having lost his marbles . Recovering slowly but surely from the phlebitis which nearly cost him his life , Mr. Nixon has been working hard on the memoirs of an extraordinary political career which took him from a grocery store in a dusty California town to the White House itself . Among other things , he hopes that the book which will eventuate will help explain to reason  --  able people exactly what happened , from his vantage point , dur  --  ing those dark months which marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televised interviews with David Frost , during which he will be subjected to no-holds-barred questioning on all subjects , including Watergate . All of which , of course , has provoked new controversies . But Mr. Nixon is no stranger to contention . His name has long trigger  --  ed almost Pavlovian reactions ranging from dismay to horror among media folk who seem unwilling to listen to his side of the story . Yet Mr. Nixon is determined to redeem his place in history . He believes , with some justification , that his five and a half years in the presidency were marked with notable achievements , particu larly in foreign policy . And he is particularly proud of the fact that when he left office not one American boy was being draft ed for military service , this af ter a decade of conflict abroad . As for Watergate , he con  --  cedes errors in judgment in han  --  dling the scandal . But he be  --  lieves that he is being judged by a standard of morality which did not apply to his predeces  --  sors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now being es  --  tablished , his Administration did not have a monopoly on dark political doings . It turns out that several of his predeces  --  sors , most notably John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , quite cavalierly misused their great powers of office for parti  --  san political purposes . Con  --  sider , for example , the wiretap  --  ping and bugging of Dr. Martin Luther King and the conse  --  quent dissemination of infor  --  mation concerning his love life . What that had to do with na  --  tional security is difficult to fathom . And consider , too , the fact that Mr. Nixon himself was wiretapped during several po  --  litical campaigns , the last time during his contest with Hubert Humphrey in 1968 . And while two wrongs do n't make a right , the significance of the " dirty tricks " played against Mr. Nixon over the years lies in the fact that the media generally failed to become horrified about them . In fact , when a professional political  --  cal prankster named Dick Tuck played tricks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote about them with a tolerance they did not demonstrate toward a Donald Segretti whose Republican tricks eventually landed him in the slammer . Of course , in the many months of his self-imposed exile at La Casa Pacifica , Mr. Nixon has had considerable time to reflect on the double standards employed by the media whenever he or his supporters were involved . Thus last fall , during Senator Frank Church 's investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency , it turn  --  ed out that Mr. Nixon was a man put upon and disobeyed by high-handed underlings of the CIA . But was that made " perfectly clear " by the media ? Of course not . However , in all these many months , Mr. Nixon has been sustained by the knowledge that a considerable number of Americans still believe in him . They absolutely refuse to be  --  lieve what 's published or broad  --  cast about him in what they usually describe as the liberal-oriented media . And nowhere is this more evident than in the tremendous amount of mail he has received since his departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail just pour  --  ed in to such an extent that there was no way to handle it with the limited facilities provided the former President by a vengeful Congress . As a result , this early mail was packed in big carton boxes . For the most part , they remain unopened . And this has annoyed Mr. Nixon no end . For answering the mail has always been a fetish with him , as it is with most politicians . But things have quieted leaked out on what was discussed , it can be safely assumed that the problems facing the Western Alliance were a major topic . On still another occasion , a delegation from the People 's Republic of China paid a courtesy visit . The Peking regime obviously still holds Mr. Nixon in high regard . Generally Mr. Nixon 's vis  --  itors  --  and there has been a steady stream of them  --  come and go without much publicity . Gone are the days of an omni  --  present press corps . In recent months his visitors have in  --  cluded Senator Charles Percy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chinese mainland , as well as former White House aide Bryce Har  --  low , who dropped by to report on the state of American politics generally . Another welcome guest was 011ie Atkins , the White House photographer during the Nixon years , who found both the former President and his wife , Pat , in fine fettle . And his photographs , published with this arti  --  cle , bear him out . As he has regained his health , the former President has begun to venture out of his San Clemente redoubt . He is often seen on the golf course at nearby Camp Pendleton with his aide , retired Marine Colonel Jack Brennan . And on special occasions he dines out , particularly at a long-time down in San Clemente . The mail is far more manageable these days . Generally , it runs to about one hundred fifty letters a day . And every effort is made to respond to them with the help of a dedicated staff of three full-time aides supple  --  mented by women volunteers from the area . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other mementoes . From time to time , the mail runs heavier . Thus , when Amer  --  ican and Soviet astronauts link  --  ed up in space last summer , more people than usual wrote to tell their former President that they had been thinking of him because it was he who had initiated the historic mission . Not only does Mr. Nixon keep close tabs on the mail , but he seeks to reply personally to more substantive letters . On an average day , he personally will dictate about twenty re  --  sponses . Of course , he con  --  tinues to hear from heads of state who , despite all that hap  --  pened in Washington , remem  --  ber and appreciate his peace  --  making efforts . In fact , many leaders on both sides of the favorite Mexican restaurant named El Adobe . After cele  --  brating Colonel Brennan 's birthday there , it took Mr. Nix  --  on fifteen minutes to make his way out of El Adobe , so large was the crowd of well-wishers that had gathered . And driving along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave at him . All of which is not to con  --  tend that there has been a sud  --  den upsurge in pro-Nixon feel  --  ing . But , as the passions aroused by Watergate begin to subside , there is far less hostil  --  ity being expressed toward the former President . Particularly when it is becoming increasing  --  ly obvious that sin was around a long time before Richard Nix  --  on was sworn into office . Adam and Eve , after all , did not tryst at the Watergate . In short , there remains a pro-Nixon constituency . Exactly how large it is no one can say . No public opinion polls , as of this writing , have been taken to determine its size . But it 's there in sizable numbers , judging from letters to editors across the country . These are citizens Iron Curtain still ca n't fully un derstand why Mr. Nixon was forced to resign . The ways of Amer  --  ican politics continue to perplex them . Particularly pleasing to the former President were the kind words expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister praised Mr. Nixon , saying that he had kept every promise he had ever made to Israel and that he had been personally responsible for the airlift which helped to save the tiny Jewish state during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 . Another former Premier  --  Giulio Andreotti of Italy  --  called on the former President for a lengthy visit . And though no wordwho generally feel that Mr. Nix on was railroaded out of office by opposition politicians incited by a media gone ape . And they agree with Chancellor W. Allen Wallis of the University of Rochester who once said , " . . . . The reaction by journalists and politicians to the Watergate break-in has been morally even more corrupt than the Watergate activities themselves . " And nowhere was that corruption more evident than in the persistent unwillingness of the press corps as well as Senate inves  --  tigators to probe the transgressions of Mr. Nixon 's predecessors Continued on page 80 taken a mild sedative , but it proved useless . The painting in my hands put me in a fever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the under  --  ground , I began to work . I removed the backing ; with a powerful magni  --  fier discovered a thin covering glued to the painting , by now almost part of the canvas . This was the most delicate surgery and I worked for nearly four hours loosening the cov  --  ering , stripping it gently from the back and ! ? in the center , Paul , in the very center between two strips of papyri , I discovered this awesome creation . It was painted on thin but remarkably tough fabric and , almost hermetically sealed , it had resisted the centuries . When I put both heads together the effect was so dazzling I could n't tear my eyes away . God knows how long I stared , but the clock was set to remind me an hour before my time expired . I did not know it , but I was weeping . . . . " I had watched Crissaldi 's face all through this astounding tale and there were indeed tears in his eyes . I perceived our common source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original skepticism . I had a dozen nagging questions , but I was most curious as to why I had been so privileged . But I could n't ask , since he was standing at the fire , my presence nearly forgotten . Final  --  ly he turned , his face calm , but I sensed a kind of tension . " You are very astute , Paul ! But do you wonder why the masterpainted two such perfect works  --  al  --  most identical ? " " Yes , that 's one of the questions in my mind , Signor . " " Well then , come here ; you 've earned this . " He looked radiant , a secret expression I 'd come to know . He removed the painting from the frame , disengaged the backing and peeled off a tiny bit of invisible pa  --  per . Under a high-powered glass I saw in the master 's own hand : Giot  --  to , 1334 . It was indistinct and , being on the back of the fabric , concealed , would not be seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fused . " But Signor , the work that stands in the monastery is placed at 1326 ... That 's an eight-year differ  --  ence . " " Precisely ! Eight years of experi  --  mentation ! Think of the implica  --  tion , Paul ; do you know what this means ? " I felt intensely agitated , looking from him to the painting and back . With all my skepticism I was con  --  fused by the simple mathematics . " Signor , are you trying to say that the Milano portrait  --  the one we all saw  --  is the experiment you had read about ? But it ca n't be ! " " Why not ? Because the idea is too staggering ? " " But then  --  this one is the  --  it 's his final work ? The original after the experiment ? That 's hard to believe . " His smile was crafty . " You forget I held them together ! I compared ! The other is filled with flaws seen only in comparison . Actually , Paul , " he bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remarkable as this one . " He replaced the backing , reframed it and put it on the easel . Then he poured us another brandy . " As I said , you 're remarkably astute , Paul , and discerning . You 're also stub  --  born , like me . " He laughed and we sat down to sip our brandy . But I was nervous and upset . He broke into my thoughts . " Tell me , Paul , why was I so in  --  sistent with my guests tonight ? Why did I want to deceive them ? Why do I want the art world to believe this painting is a copy  --  preferably by someone in a later century ? You 're clever , you reject all dogmas . Tell me , what 's my motive ? " I felt Crissaldi was exacting payment for my unique privilege and I finally smiled , holding my glass to toast him . I took a long sip of brandy and said , " To discover a new Giotto after 600 years  --  really , Signor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Intuition is one thing , but caution , well , it 's the wisdom of truth . " He smiled , shook my hand very warmly , and I got up to leave . 2 Nixon 's misfortunes . Which rules out most Democrats who , like Birch Bayh , have indicated they intend to campaign against the Nixon specter . The Nixon issue , ironically , has be  --  come a double-edged sword . Senator Henry M. Jackson , for example , has been accused by liberal presidential documents and tapes , as were presidents before him . Instead , the Justice Department has claimed that Mr. Nixon could not be trusted with those materials , the implication being that future Watergate investi  --  gations could be thwarted . But contrary to popular assump  --  tion , Mr. Nixon has fully cooperated with all federal inquiries on Water  --  gate . In fact , then Special Prosecutor Henry S. Ruth told the court last September that he was fully satisfied with the material provided by the former President and his lawyers . If the Watergate story has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself main  --  tained , what is the reason for the proposed confiscation if not to Continued on page 84 continued from page 75 country , usually the man represent  --  ing the oldest district , and he speaks for the church . The United States has never followed this policy of des  --  ignating one of its Cardinals to be primate , but in the passage of years certain preeminent Cardinals have enjoyed that distinction informally . The great Cardinal Gibbons of Balti  --  more held that honor , and so did Cardinal Spellman of New York . It seems probable that John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia could become the informal primate of this country , a remarkable conservative-liberal who serves both his church and his society well . There is speculation on what will happen when Pope Paul VI dies or retires to allow the Papal throne to be occupied by a younger leader . The chances are overwhelming that when a vacancy does occur , an  --  other Italian will be chosen , for this has been the tradition since the reign of Adrian VI , a Dutchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has prospered . Numerous Italian Car  --  dinals now serving are papabile ( qualified to become Pope ) , so there would be no necessity to seek out  --  side their ranks ; although there is the delicious possibility , however long the odds , that the new Pope will be chosen from other than the ranks of the Cardinals . In theory , any breath  --  ing male Catholic can be elected Pope , be he a preadolescent tinker from the alleyways of Belfast , or a married shopkeeper from a town in New Jersey . And there has been quite a bit of whispered discussion over the past forty years that perhaps the time has come for the consideration of some non-Italian . The stormy politics of Italy and the desire to heal old schisms among the rites are two valid reasons . Others include the fact that Italians are outnumbered in the Col  --  lege of Cardinals and that numerous Cardinals outside of Italy are emi  --  nently papabile . Cardinal Cooke of New York would be one . And cer  --  tainly Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , Krol tells them , " This is one position I would never seek , because I feel I am needed right here in my own backyard . " " It is terribly presumptuous of any man to think about the possibil  --  ity of his being elected Pope , " Krol has stated . " I ca n't imagine anyone aspiring to the burdensome , tiring duties of the Papacy . It is a much more satisfying duty to visit the sick or to console the relatives of the dead . " Rome , St. Peter 's , Vatican City , they are all so awesome , frightening even . If given the luxury of day  --  dreaming , I 'd rather daydream that all of my bills have been paid and my schools have just received some mysterious grant that will keep'them open for all time  --  or at least until it is someone else 's turn to worry about them . " LI continued from page 81 act in a heartless , vindictive man  --  ner  --  as a means of punishing the former President . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did n't President Ford step in and raise his voice against such unseemly treat  --  ment of his predecessor ? The feeling is that the President has been seeking to assuage the anti-Nixon savagery still lurking in the media and a Dem  --  ocratic-controlled Congress . But there are other reasons for the disenchantment with Mr. Ford . Many Nixonites do n't feel he is as conservative as Ronald Reagan . And while they cheered Mr. Ford for his handling of the Mayaguez incident , they were positively outraged by his undiplomatic slighting of Alexander Solzhenitsyn . As for detente , they never believed it should mean a dimi  --  nution in efforts to expose the true nature of the Communist beast . And Secretary Kissinger 's coddling of the Castro regime , presumably with President Ford 's blessing , leaves them absolutely cold . Even before he was forced to leave the Soviet Union , Solzhenitsyn made reference to the " dense hypoc  --  risy characteristic of today 's Ameri  --  can political life " and most notably " of the Senate leaders with their dis  --  torted view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without in any way defending Nixon or the Republican party , " the Nobel laureate went on , " how can one not be amazed at the hypocrit  --  ical , clamorous rage displayed by the Democrats ? " Has American politics not been full of mutual deceit and cases of misconduct during previous election campaigns , except , perhaps , that they were not on such a high level of electronic technology and remained happily undiscovered ? " Never have I seen truer words written . Meanwhile , as he works on his memoirs , Mr. Nixon ca n't help thinking of the future . And this is Ho hat troubles some of his critics who fear that , as he has in the past , he will make some sort of political come  --  back . But resuming an active polit  --  ical career is the last thing Mr. Nixon has on his mind . So his critics can breathe more easily . But what does a man in his ex  --  traordinary position do ? What role can he play in which he will be able to utilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? These are questions he mulls over constantly with family and friends . The answers , in the final analysis , will depend on the recep  --  tion he receives when he " goes pub  --  lic " with the publication of his mem  --  oirs and his subsequent television appearances . Until then , Richard Milhous Nix  --  on , former President of the United States , will remain a ghostly national presence  --  briefly glimpsed and rare  --  ly heard in public . Because that 's the way he wants it to be . 21
