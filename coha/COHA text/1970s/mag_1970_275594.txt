PAPILLON by Henri Charrire. 434 pages . William Morrow . $8.95 . <P> Even his underworld name is perfect : Papillon-because he has a butterfly tattooed on his chest . <P> His real-life scenario begins in Paris , on Montmartre in 1930 . At 23 , he is a suave breaker of hearts and a slick cracker of safes . Suddenly , he is framed for a murder he did not commit and sentenced to prison for life-or " perpetuity " as the French , knowing their own penal system , more realistically put it . Shuffled off to French Guiana , he tries to break out nine times . On the first escape , he makes it 1,800 miles to Colombia in an open boat , staying free for eleven months before being caught and returned to the penal colony . <P> Over the years , other attempts come to grief more quickly . His pal 's belt buckle catches noisily on the edge of a zinc roof at the key moment .

But Papillon still has money , left from more than 10,000 underworld francs that he put in a plan , a small , polished , waterproof metal tube , harbored in his lower intestine . Papillon is also stirred by dreams of revenge as well as a longing to go straight and start a new life . Sent to solitary for two years , he performs a prison miracle : surviving without going mad . His pals smuggle extra food to him . He methodically exercises his memory while pacing his cell up to eleven hours a day to keep in shape . Finally , in 1941 , Papillon escapes definitively , floating away from Devil 's Island on a pair of tide-driven bags stuffed with coconuts to serve as food and floatation .

He reads a book of prison memoirs by an Algerian-born lady ex-con named Albertine Sarrazin . Hastily , he buys 13 school notebooks . In a few months , apparently with near total recall , he scribbles Part I ( 1931 to 1945 ) in longhand and mails it to Sarrazin 's editors in Paris . Called Papillon ( what else ? ) and barely touched by an editor 's pencil , it sells 1,000,000 copies in France , setting a new French record . It is sold to the Book-of-the-Month Club in the U.S. ( this November 's selection ) and , at an estimated $1,000,000 , is contracted for the largest first printing in Pocket Books ' history ( close to 3,000,000 copies ) . It is a Reader 's Digest Condensed Book for the fall . Film rights are bought for more than $500,000 . Papillon has become a light industry .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
