To generations of Roman Catholics , Lutherans and Calvinists , a catechism was a manual of questions and answers on doctrine that youngsters were expected to memorize . In a book billed as the first " ecumenical catechism " since the Reformation , the Q.-and-A. format and many of the old answers are missing . Adults , not children , have been its readers since it was published in West Germany and Switzerland two years ago . <P> Now translated into English , The Common Catechism ( The Seabury Press ; $10.95 ) is timed for Easter release in the U.S. Unlike traditional catechisms , the new book has a meek tone . For example , it notes that Christ 's Resurrection has been a " permanent problem " for modern man . At one point it defends belief in the Trinity by remarking diffidently that it " may not have been such a bad idea after all . " <P> The book is the joint product of 36 respected Protestant and Catholic theologians , most of them German and German-Swiss , who were commissioned to write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of conversations at Vatican Council II between the Rev. Lukas Vischer , the top theologian at the World Council of Churches , and his friend Father Johannes Feiner , who was later appointed to the Pope 's theological commission . Although Vischer and Feiner edited the book , it lacks official Protestant status , and the Vatican has made no comment . <P> Continuing Disputes . Much of the Catechism covers themes that have always united Protestants and Catholics : the reality of God , the work of Christ , the importance of prayer . Building on years of ecumenical discussion , the book also claims substantial current Protestant-Catholic agreement on previous points of division like Christ 's presence in the Eucharist . As for the Reformation 's belief in salvation through " grace alone , " as against man 's good works , the Catechism professes to see little left to argue about . In fact , it contends that " it would certainly have been possible " to unite Protestants and Catholics except for continuing disputes on two topics : 1 ) the status of Mary in doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church , including the papacy . <P> The Catechism rejects a number of ideas that Catholics , Lutherans and Calvinists have traditionally affirmed . For instance , the orthodox formulation of original sin is discarded . Because of it , old Catholic catechisms taught that it was a mortal sin not to baptize infants . The new Catechism says that " there can be no fundamental objections " if parents let children decide on their own whether to seek baptism , as Baptists do . <P> Following the trend of German scholarship , the book puts considerable limitations on the Bible . It says that " we can learn virtually nothing " from Scripture on specific questions of sexual morality . The Ten Commandments are " to a large extent conditioned by their age . " Many New Testament passages are described as interpretations that were made later on by the church instead of accounts of what Jesus said and did .
