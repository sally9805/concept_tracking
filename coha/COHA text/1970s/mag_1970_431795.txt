 | The Kienast Quints A year ago Peggy Jo and Bill Kienast , an attractive couple from Liberty Corner , NJ. , were just as obscure as any young Americans . They had two small children and a third on the way , a house in the country , a station wagon , and the usual assortment of debts . Even on the cold , damp morning of February 24 , 1970 , the two were unknown . But that night between 10:08 and 10:18 , the Kienasts made history . In addition to Meg , almost four , and John , 18 months , they became the parents of five tiny but perfect infants ? Amy , Sara , William Gordon , Jr. , Abigail , and Edward . Despite the new fertility drugs which increase the chance of multiple birth , despite progress in keeping premature babies alive , the successful arrival of quintuplets is still a medical miracle . Over 50 quintets have been born in the twentieth century , but the five Kienasts are only the second set to survive in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others : the Canadian Dionnes , the Diligentis of Argentina , the Prietos of Venezuela , the South Dakota Fischers , and the Lawsons of New Zealand . ) Of these half-dozen , the Kienasts are in many ways the most remarkable . Premature birth is inevitable for a woman carrying quintuplets , but Peggy Jo 's babies came only six weeks early , a record for five births . At birth , the heaviest , Gordon , weighed almost four and a half pounds , and Amy , the tiniest , checked in at three and a quarter pounds . The delivery took only ten minutes , and within 24 hours , doctors confidently predicted that they would survive . At 14 weeks Gordon 's weight ? more than 11 pounds ? was within the normal range for his age . Now six months-old , they are just like other babies , squirmy , smiling , alert ? multiplied by five . Part of the credit for this unusual record belongs to the hospital in which they were born ? the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But most must go to their parents , who are a remarkable young couple . " I do n't know what I would have done if I had quintuplets ? cut my throat , I guess , " a friend of theirs says . " But if anybody could pull it off , it 's Peggy Jo and Bill . " They are a handsome pair : Peggy Jo , tall ( five foot seven ) , with softly curling dark hair , deep-set gray eyes , a merry smile , and a dimple ; Bill , a chunky blue-eyed blond , with short-cropped hair and a perpetual sunburn . The two are unflappable . Although inside they must get just as churned up as anyone else , they simply do not show it . They are pragmatists , efficient without being officious , witty without acting the clown . " Peggy Jo enjoys a challenge , " says her sister-in-law , Susan Ratcliffe . " She does her darnedest to solve a problem and then just stops worrying about it . " Despite her easy manner , Peggy Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , the infants came home to share a three-bedroom house with their parents , sister and brother , and a nurse . The only bathroom was a flight of stairs away from the nursery . In a week , the nurse quit . In three weeks , all five infants caught cold . At first , they drank 25 bottles a day , which required about 75 burpings . Their diapers were changed four hundred times each week . Nevertheless , after a month , the Kienasts gave a dinner party for eight , a gourmet meal which Peggy Jo cooked and served herself ! The story of the Kienast quintuplets actually begins eight years before they were born . There were gay parties , a church ceremony , a country-club reception when Margaret Jovita Ratcliffe , 22 , of Westfield , N.J. , married William Gordon Kienast , 30 , of Arlington , Va . For the bride , though , there was one small concern . Shortly before her marriage , her men- strual periods stopped . Typically , Peggy Jo brushed away the problem . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement of getting married . " Superbly healthy , she could not imagine that it was anything serious . Unfortunately , it was . Three doctors could find nothing wrong , but the last referred her to a neurologist in New York . His diagnosis : Peggy Jo had a tumor of the pituitary gland . This is the master gland at the base of the skull which releases hormones to stimulate many vital functions , including reproduction . Growing , a pituitary tumor may threaten vision , even life itself . Luckily , Peggy Jo 's was caught early , and it was benign . In 1964 she was treated with 20 daily doses of powerful betatron rays , which shrank the growth to nothing . With one exception , pituitary function remained intact . But that exception meant potential tragedy for a young couple now eager to start a family . Ovulation had ceased . Only a few years earlier there would have been no recourse , but now the neurologist referred her to Dr. Raymond Vande Wiele , who heads the Division of Gynecological Endocrinology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the pituitary hormone which triggers the ovarian cycle . Ovulation can now , however , be stimulated by substituting a drug called Perganol . The treatment is unpleasant ? daily injections for several weeks ? and not without hazard . For although nature subtly orchestrates its production of hormones , man , when he intervenes , fails to achieve a similar balance . Often , as a result of Perganol injections , more than one egg is released and fertilized . Twins are common ; quadruplets and , in one case , even septuplets have been conceived . Peggy Jo and Bill were warned of this danger , but they took their chances . Meg was a Perganol baby , and so was John . Both were single births , and " we thought we had the problem licked , " Peggy Jo says . In June , 1969 , she drove to New York ? 50 miles away ? for another series of injections to help produce a third ( and last ) child . One small change was made in the treatment . Although Perganol ripens the egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to burst the ripe follicle and send the egg spinning down the Fallopian tube . This luteinizing hormone ( LH ) is scarce and expensive , and a substitute is usually used in conjunction with Perganol . But , at the time , ColumbiaPresbyterian had a small supply of LH , and the doctors decided to give it to Peggy Jo in the hope that it might reduce the chance of multiple birth . Obviously , the hope was not realized . Dr. Vande Wiele , red-faced , says simply , " We were n't very successful . " Pregnancy followed the treatment promptly , but this pregnancy was different . Within a few months , Peggy Jo 's clothes were straining at the seams . At the eight-week checkup , Dr. Ralph Jewelewicz , the obstetrician who had given the fertility treatment , told her to expect twins ? at least . It was still too early to X-ray the uterus to determine exactly how many fetuses were growing inside . " I decided to think two , and there would be two . Bill and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken in mid-November . Peggy Jo carried the fresh plates from the radiology department to Dr. Jewelewicz 's office in another part of the hospital . As the doctors bent over the film , she studied their faces . Eyes widened . " There 's one . " exclaimed a doctor , pointing to a tiny white spot . " There 's another . " " And another . " Hands pointed excitedly . Secretaries ran in to take a look . The X-rays showed four tiny skulls and a suspicious shadow . It might be a fif ch.  | " I sat there numbly , " Peggy Jo recalls , " just letting it sink in . " Then she telephoned Bill . He was fast asleep . His company was on strike , and he and other executives had spent the night manning the machines in its New Jersey plant . " Well , okay , " he mumbled , only half-awake . Later he was all smiles . " Great , wonderful , " he said . During the next months , no one recalls hearing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there were problems to be faced . Shortly before Meg 's birth , the Kienasts had moved to their own home , a 68-year-old farmhouse set in four gently rolling acres in rural New Jersey . The sixroom frame house had been abandoned for 15 years ; its door was missing , a window broken , and it was surrounded by a wild tangle of blackberry brambles . The two spent 15 months rebuilding the house themselves , putting in floors , tiling the bathroom , painting , papering , plastering . In the same leisurely fashion they planned to construct a new wing for their third child . Peggy Jo had drawn the plans herself . Now she drew new plans to include a thirdfloor expansion attic , in addition to six rooms , three fireplaces , and three baths . But at that point , how to house the babies was less important than how to keep them alive . Already Peggy Jo could feel the infants moving inside . ( " They never did kick much , " she said later . " They were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prematurity . The longer they remain inside the mother 's body , the better their chance to make it . " Peggy Jo just made up her mind she was going to have those babies , " a friend says . Ordered to stay off her feet , she found that ? with a home , a husband , and two small children ? it was almost impossible . In December , the four moved in with her parents , Mr. and Mrs. French Ratcliffe , in Westfield , 15 miles away . Peggy Jo complied meekly when Dr. Jewelewicz ordered her to enter the hospital at the beginning of January , but she won one small concession . If all went well , she continued on page 179  | would be allowed to go home for a weekend later in the month . The weekend never materialized , because another X-ray came first . This time it clearly showed five tiny skulls and five rounded little spinal columns . The news was almost an anticlimax . " Once we got used to four , five did n't throw us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill never discussed the possibility that one or more might not make it , but they bought no cribs , clothing , bottles ; they just waited . In Room 838 of Presbyterian 's private Harkness Pavilion , Peggy Jo kept herself busy working jigsaw and crossword puzzles , reading mystery stories , paying household bills . Bill came almost daily to join her in a cocktail before dinner . The doctors encouraged her to drink ? a martini in the middle of the night if she wanted it ? because alcohol , a muscle relaxant , is helpful in stilling premature contractions of the uterus . A. month passed , and Peggy Jo became increasingly restless . She tacked a large calendar to the door of her room , and crossed out each day . Halfteasing , half-serious , she kept prodding Dr. Jewelewicz ? when would he permit her to start labor ? They set a goal for Lincoln 's Birthday , February 12 . It came and passed , and they moved their sights to Washington 's Birthday , February 22 . Dr. Stanley James , the pediatrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quintuplets were always born when the moon waxed full . On a Saturday night the moon rose , a lustrous circle . " I sat up all night and howled at the moon , " Peggy Jo reported sadly , " but nothing happened . " Meanwhile , the medical staff perfected its plans so that the delivery would go off with the precision of a rocket launching . Curiously , for the birth of these all-American babies , the key physicians were all foreign-born : Dr. Jewelewicz , the obstetrician , and Dr. Mieczyslaw ( Mike ) Finster , the anesthesiologist , both refugees from Nazi Poland ; Dr. James , the pediatrician , a New Zealander ; and Dr. Paul Poppers , Dr. Finster 's associate , a Dutchman . Each assigned young staff doctors to augment the delivery team , made sure that resuscitation equipment ? five of everything ? would be instantly available . They drew up a list of telephone numbers to mobilize the doctors swiftly if labor started during the night . On Tuesday night , February 17 , there was a false alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and Peggy Jo wheeled to the delivery floor . But within hours the pains petered out . To play safe , the doctors kept Peggy Jo in a labor room all night- " on a miserable rock of a bed , " she complained . Never before a grumbler , she was finding it increasingly hard to smile , and no one blamed her . She was absolutely huge ? like a little Buddha , " @# @# Dr. Finster says . Without three fat pillows to prop her up , she became breathless when she lay on her back . Turning over in bed was a major project . Her body started to swell with fluid ? one day she gained two pounds . Her blood pressure rose . At night she slept in snatches , a bare hour at a time . " It was a horror , " she recalled later . Tuesday , February 24 , started as an uneventful day . About six P.M. Dr. Jewelewicz checked Peggy Jo for the second time , and went home to his dinner . Dr. James telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her supper . Satisfied , he too went home . Bill sat with her while she picked at her meal . At 8:15 she felt a damp sensation . Bill rang the buzzer , and a junior obstetrical resident --  " more nervous than we , " Bill says ? made a cursory inspection . The bag of waters had ruptured . Birth was probably only hours away . The hospital moved into action . The resident telephoned Dr. Jewelewicz . He raced back from his home in Queens in 20 minutes ? record time . Dr. Stuart Arm , chief obstetrical resident , examined the patient , and was startled to see one tiny leg already poking its way into the birth canal . He alerted the delivery floor . Still Peggy Jo had no pain . " I felt , This is great . Let 's go , ' " she recalls . She was wheeled to the delivery floor and placed in a labor room . Orders were given for a possible cesarean section . But at 9 P.M. , just as Dr. Jewelewicz arrived , labor contractions started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Jewelewicz started to telephone . Dr. Finster was at home , only five minutes away ; he left immediately for the hospital . Dr. Poppers was paged in a nearby lecture hall . Dr. James lives in downtown Manhattan over seven miles from the hospital , but Dr. Jewelewicz told him not to hurry . " I doubt if she 'll deliver before midnight , " he said . Birth is always dramatic , but this birth was part comic opera , part neartragedy . Despite the plans , labor progressed so fast that the first baby almost arrived before the patient was wheeled to the delivery room . Doctors had no time for the usual five-minute scrub but ran back and forth frantically , hunting for sterile gloves , masks , gowns . Young residents on the floor were pulled away from other duties . Eventually , the team numbered 16 persons ? 12 doctors , three nurses , a nurse 's aide . One principal never made it . Dr. James ' car developed battery trouble , and he arrived , panting , just after the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The patient had just eaten dinner . If general anesthesia were needed , she might vomit a morsel of food and breathe it down into her lungs . Her hugely stretched uterus was likely to press on vital blood vessels , causing a precipitous drop in blood pressure . Vigorous resuscitation could well be needed at the same moment for five tiny infants . The delivery started smoothly . As @#  | Peggy Jo breathed nitrous oxide ( laughing gas ) which dulls pain but does not anesthetize , the first baby ( Amy ) , a footling breech , was born at 10 : 08 ? feet first , then buttocks , finally the head . The second ( Sara ) appeared almost immediately in the usual head-first position , and was born without aid . As Dr. Jewelewicz held each newborn , Dr. Arm cut and clamped the umbilical cord . Then Dr. Jewelewicz handed the baby to a waiting doctor ? five of them , one for each child . Now there was trouble . Gordon , the third and largest baby , was moving head down toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his umbilical cord , which had descended first , and now threatened to strangle him . The fourth ( Abigail ) , feet first , was struggling to beat him into the world . Deep anesthesia was needed fast to relax the uterus completely . To forestall the hazard of vomiting , the anesthesiologist delicately threaded a tube into the patient 's windpipe . Through the tube , they pumped halothane , a rapid-acting inhalation anesthetic which depresses the central nervous system . " Once you use it , " says Dr. Arm , " you 're committed to rapid birth . " The procedure took 90 seconds . There were still three babies to come . Reaching into the uterus , Dr. Jewelewicz pushed the cord back , grabbed hold of the slippery feet of the third baby , and deftly rotated his body 180 degrees to pull him out feet first . Working blind , this is a tricky and seldomused procedure . If , by error , the operator should tug on a tiny hand instead of a foot , he may lodge a shoulder firmly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three minutes . " It seemed a lifetime , " Dr. Jewelewicz says . In another three minutes he extracted the fourth baby , feet first , and at 10:18 , the fifth , Edward . From the beginning there was high hope . All the babies breathed spontaneously . For prematures they looked enormous . The doctors placed each in a heated resuscitator and suctioned the tiny throats and noses of mucus . Abigail 's heart rate slowed , and Dr. Poppers moved swiftly to administer closed chest cardiac massage . Dr. Jewelewicz remained with the mother , ordering a drug to help the uterus contract , and then waiting anxiously . The uterus is a muscle ; when it is overdistended like a stretched rubber band , it may lack the tone to spring back to normal size . Then naked blood vessels may pour out blood at a fearful rate , and surgery may be needed to staunch the hemorrhage . All went well . Although Peggy Jo spent the night in the recovery room , doctors checking constantly , no unusual bleeding developed . Meanwhile each infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive-care unit of the neonatal nursery in Babies Hospital , 15 floors and several corridors away . Pacing a corridor outside , Bill Kienast helped a nurse carry Amy and Sara . Dr. James , still struggling to get an arm into his white hospital jacket , arrived to supervise the transportation of Abigail and Edward . Now Dr. James , a nationally known specialist in problems of the newborn was in charge . Twenty-five hours passed before he went home to bed . and for the first week he spent ten or 12 hours a day at the babies ' side Evaluating the infants , he was guardedly optimistic . Although their weigh varied by 20 ounces , all were within normal range for a 34-week gestation and all were almost identical in lengt : . This was a good sign , an indication that none had suffered starvation in the uterus. @# " In comparison with what we usually get , these were healthy babies , " says Priscilla Parke , head neonatal nurse . Yet there was special concern for three ( Amy , Sara , and Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in which the lungs become stiff and hard to expand . ( It is the condition that took the life of Patrick Kennedy , President Kennedy 's third-born , and is a major killer of premature infants . ) To assist the labored breathing , Dr. James ordered oxygen in high concentration to be pumped into the incubators . In 18 hours the babies were given sugar water by mouth , and within a day started on a dilute milk formula . They were able to suck , but it tired them ; feeding was completed through a tiny tube threaded into the stomach . On the third day Sara 's breathing became strained , and she developed an infection which was treated by antibiotics . That same day three turned yellow with jaundice ; they received mini-sunbaths under ultraviolet light . Once the problems of respiration and infection were licked , the infants ' weight became a concern . All lost at least ten percent of their birth weight . Three weeks passed before the last of  | the five regained the loss , but then they grew splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine days they graduated from intensive care to the transition section of the nursery . Early in April the incubator doors swung open , and they moved into bassinets , each decorated with an appropriate pink or blue rosette . The morning after the birth Peggy Jo made a triumphant re-entry to Room 838 . Nurses crowded round the stretcher . " You look so flat , " one marveled . Patients peeked out of their rooms ; some delayed going home ; and curious visitors milled in the corridor . " I felt just great , " she recalls . " It was a load off my back and my mind . The best thing was knowing we had five hardy little babies . It was a pleasure to lie on my back and be able to breathe . " A few days later she stepped on the scales , and exulted . She had lost 48 pounds , and weighed only 133 ? " that 's practically skin and bones for me . " On the first afternoon , Peggy Jo was wheeled to the nursery to reach inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon making the trip on foot . She remained in the hospital only six more days , and they flew by . Letters poured in from all over the world , some enclosing dollar bills . A messenger boy , trembling with excitement , brought an engraved card from President Nixon in the White House , New York 's Mayor Lindsay sent five stretch suits for the babies . Just before she went home , Peggy Jo and Bill , with all the aplomb of royalty , held a press conference , fielding questions deftly . Newsmen were astonished when the new mother insisted they correct her age , which hospital publicists had reported as 27 . " I 'm 30 , " she said . " My classmates are about to clobber me ! " Home in Liberty Corner , the Kienasts tried to prepare Meg and John for the quintuplets ' arrival . Three-year-old Meg announced that the babies were going to bring her candy and she would give them pajamas and a hat , but one evening as their pictures flashed on the television screen , she switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my babies tonight , " she said . Twice weekly Peggy Jo made the hundred-mile round trip through thick New Jersey traffic to feed and diaper and coo at her babies . Soon she learned to tell them apart . Although none are identical , all five ? with their blue eyes and fuzz of golden hair ? look alike to the casual eye . Someone asked , " What do you see that we do n't ? " " My babies , " she replied . On weekends Bill worked to lay the foundations for the new wing . He is an excellent amateur craftsman who built his family a swimming pool two years ago , but now professional help was needed ? and fast . Local builders volunteered to hold a house-raising party . In a single weekend in early April , with @# @#  | hammers tapping and power saws buzzing , dozens of workmen framed in the shell of the addition . But work proceeded slowly on the inside ? plumbing , insulation , air-conditioning . It was due for completion in May , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the weather report , " Peggy Jo said . " It changes every hour . " Meanwhile the babies kept growing . Prematures are usually allowed to go home when they weigh five and a half pounds . By late April Amy weighed over six pounds ; three others more than seven ; and Gordon , over eight . " I want my babies home , " Peggy Jo announced firmly . A woman of action , she promptly made room for them in the small house . She moved John 's crib into Meg 's room , and squeezed the twin adult beds into John 's room . ( Space is so tight that she and Bill climb into bed from the bottom ; a bureau squarely blocks the room 's only closet . ) The master bedroom measures 10 by 16 feet . It held ? but barely ? five borrowed cribs , two chests and two diaper pails . On April 27 , one day before the quints were nine weeks old , the Kienasts drove to Babies Hospital in a blue and white ambulance , manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few minutes later five smiling nurses descended from the second floor , each carrying a baby in a yellow and white knitted outfit , wrapped in a pink or blue blanket . Bedlam broke loose as 50 newsman jostled to ask questions , light bulbs flashed , and radio and TV microphones were pushed under their noses . It looked for a time as if a nurse and her baby might be knocked down or tripped by a television wire . Always gracious , the Kienasts smiled , but " I was about to blow my cool , " Peggy Jo said later . " I kept saying , Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . ' " Nevertheless , she had time for a quip . Asked if she planned any additions to the family , she replied with a grin , " Well , yes . Maybe a dog . " In the ambulance , the Kienasts placed the babies in five white plastic carriers , and strapped each firmly to the two stretchers in the rear . It was warm ? 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo started to unwrap the blanketed babies . An hour and a half later , the quintuplets were home . Waiting in the driveway were Meg and John ; Peggy Jo 's parents ; Bill 's sister , Ms 's . Olin Boone and her 15-year-old son , Scott ; a practical nurse ; six policemen ; two reporters ; and a seven-man TV camera crew , taking pictures for NBC 's First Tuesday show to be aired in September . The yard was awash with their cables and equipment . Inside , baby paraphernalia was scattered everywhere . John 's playpen was stacked high with bags of disposable diapers ; cartons of milk formula were piled in the kitchen along with five yellow portable bathtubs . On a dining-room chair lay 18 tomato seedlings , ready for planting. , Peggy Jo , her arms around the older children , took in the disarray without dismay " Well , gang , " she said , " we made it . " Sensing the excitement , the quinthad spent a restless night , and eaten poorly in the morning . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of the placid hospital routine . Gordon , lower lip trembling started to howl . Within seconds , all five were wailing . The change from the movie-star atmosphere of the hospital to the nitty-gritty chores at home was startling . Asked whether she felt letdown , Peggy Jo looked surprised . " No. this is the good time now . " For the first night , it was n't all that good . At 11 : 30 P.M. the exhausted Kienasts crawled into bed . The nurse was already asleep on a roll-away bed in the living room . At 2:10 A.M. Sara began to cry . Peggy Jo went downstairs for a bottle . When she returned Ted and Amy were stirring . The problem was that although each baby had slept through the night feeding at some time , all five had never slept through at the same time . By 3 A.M. all the babies were awake and wailing to be fed . " This is ridiculous , " Peggy Jo thought . " I could be here all night . " Never a worrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went to bed and lay there , wide awake . One or another yelled until 6 A.M. " I said to myself ? no , we 're going to have to let them holler . We just ca n't do it any other way . " The next morning , red-eyed , she reached a second decision . She had always cuddled Meg and John in her lap as they sucked their bottles , but with two persons and five demanding infants , this was impossible . Improvising with a blanket , she propped each infant in a corner of his crib , and placed a bottle in each hungry mouth . By the time the fifth bottle was in place , the first baby was ready to be picked up for a burp . That way took less than an hour to feed all five . To still the night hunger , she added cereal to the evening bottle , and although Sara awakened the next night , the nursery was comparatively quiet . The 2 A.M. feeding had ended . Pragmatic , she compromised in other ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wipe off five milky little mouths , she swiped each face with a common cloth . Still , with clothing and bedding changed frequently , the washing machine in the @#  | basement runs twice daily with the infant garments alone . " If only someone would invent a dryer which folds the clothes automatically , " Peggy Jo sighs . Before a week was out , Peggy Jo had slipped into a routine which , if hardly restful , was bearable . " I 'm fine . I 'm surviving , " she told friends . Three nurses came and went before she settled down , for the summer at least , with Cheryl Birchall , a recently capped graduate nurse . From an in tiat dye meals a day , Peggy Jo shifted the infants in early May to four , and at the beginning of June to three , adding fruit , then vegetables and meat to their diet . She makes such decisions on her own . Although she has an excellent pediatrician nearby , she considers telephonic advice on " minor " matters an imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Ted wriggles over from stomach to back and starts to howl . She turns him and returns to bed until 6:30 A.M. when the day officially starts . Bill dresses and breakfasts the older two while Peggy Jo moves swiftly among the five , feeding , burping , diapering . Late in the morning , a visiting public health nurse comes from nearby Bernardsville to help bathe the infants in the double kitchen sink , and stays for the 12:30 P.m. feeding . This is the social meal . Each day Peggy Jo rounds up enough neighbors so that every baby can be held for his bottle by a substitute mother . So far volunteers have been plentiful . They include friends , fellow-members of the Episcopal church of St. John on the Mountain in Bernardsville , and even women whom she has never met before . It is a charming sight to visit the nursery , with its flowered wallpaper and hooked rug , in early afternoon . The five women sit on folding chairs in front of the cribs , with the day 's meal on snack tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows and knees almost touch . Each talks to her charge , croons , pleads as she slips in a spoonful of slippery food or pats to encourage a burp . Peggy Jo is everywhere , feeding , advising , hovering . No one is in a hurry , and the women linger for an hour or more . The quintuplets are weighed every Monday , and after the first unsettled week , their gains have been steady . Now they are plump babies , with dimpled necks and rolls of fat on their thighs . They gaze intently at the bright mobiles swinging over the cribs ; they smile , gurgle , wave arms and leg in frantic ecstasy . They are easy babies , probably because they have an easygoing mother . Was Peggy Jo always a mothering person ? Not a bit of it . As a child she was a tomboy , and in high school , she was more interested in tennis than in baby-sitting . She had barely ever handled an infant before Meg was born . Even now , " I 'm still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little babies but I look forward to when they 're older and more responsive . " Peggy Jo had a comfortable uppermiddle-class childhood in an eightroom , three-bath house in Westfield . Her father is an executive with a supermarket chain . She drove her own car at 17 , and went to Europe at 21 . For one year she attended Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs , N.Y. , but " I was having too much fun to study . " She worked before her marriage , but never held a job longer than six months . " I always seemed to be working in between other things . " Bill 's father , who died a half-dozen years ago , was a scientist with the Federal government . He grew up in the Washington suburb of Arlington , Va. ; served an Army hitch in Korea ; and graduated from Center College in Danville , Ky . Then while he hunted a job , he lived with his sister in Westfield . For five years , he sold plastics for the Nixon-Baldwin Division of Tenneco Chemicals , a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is devoting the summer to his family . The Kienasts refuse to discuss their personal finances , but friends report Bill 's annual salary from Tenneco at about $16,000 . The two met ten years ago on a blind date at a party . The following weekend they went skiing together ? " She knocked me down three times on the slope , " Bill says ? and on October 14 , 1961 , they were married . Bill is more interested in his home and his family than in setting the business world on fire . " He 's just not gung ho about becoming a captain of industry , " his sister says . Yet both have always enjoyed the good life and firmly intend to keep it . " We certainly want to be comfortable , " Peggy Jo says , " and by comfortable , I mean better than hand-to-mouth . " How they will pull off this feat with seven children , six of whom will eventually attend college at the same time , does not trouble the Kienasts one whit . Friends ask Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can you worry about money ? " he counters . " As far as I 'm concerned , the funny farms are filled with people who worry when they do n't need to . " Despite this insouciance , the Kienast hospital bill is staggering ? about $55 , - 000 , more than three years ' salary for Bill . It includes Peggy Jo 's private room ? $100 a day for 63 days ? and the quintuplets ' premature care ? $200 a day per baby while they were in incubators , and $97 daily per child once they moved to bassinets . Happily , Bill 's company has a generous health insurance policy . " I do n't expect I 'll have to pay out more than $800 , " Bill says , " and it may be even less . " Somehow , other expenses also seem to be taking care of themselves . People are touched , and show it financially when a family produces quintuplets . Bill bought the lumber for the new wing of the house ? " the price was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed free . He doubts if the addition will cost them more than $15,000 Then there is the baby food . With five - infants gobbling more than 20 bottles a day , the first month 's bills for formula alone should have cost about $150 , but a manufacturer started them off with a gift of 42 cases , and promises to continue the supply . Another baby-food company has donated all the strained fruit , meat , and vegetables the infants need . The major problem is where to stack the stuff . Every kitchen cupboard is filled , plus half of the double wall oven ; and the dilapidated barn near the swimming pool houses the rest . Shortly after the quintuplets ' birth . the Kienasts hired a business manager to look after their interests and protect them from get-rich-quick schemers . One such person turned up briefly . claiming he was soliciting funds for the " Kienast Foundation . " When a radio station telephoned Peggy Jo to ask if his appeal had her okay , she was horrified . " Good grief , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to secure the family 's endorsement of their products , and they will probably sign a contract with one company . " We 're not going to exploit the kids . Bill says , " but we 'd be foolish if we did n't talk to these people . " The Kienasts have no desire to accumulate either money or publicity ? which is why they are allowing their story to be told only in Good Housekeeping . They just want to be left alone to solve their unusual problems and they feel calmly confident that they can do it . So far Peggy Jo has not become restless with the endless chore of caring for five infants , because her day is not all babies by a long shot . In the spring and summer , she planted and weeded a flower and vegetable garden : her herb bed , with over a dozen vegetables , is her pride . When her church ran a bake sale , she made two white cakes with chocolate icing , and did n't use a mix either . Occasionally , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to backstop the nurse . When she entertains , it 's always a gourmet meal . complete with properly chilled wine . What is the secret of this young woman , who apparently cares for five with less effort than many mothers do for one ? Dr. James , an admirer , says . " She never worries about unnecessary things . Both she and Bill are deep thinkers and people of few words . I 'd call them an ideal Mr. and Mrs. America . " Such effusion embarrasses Peggy Jo . " Actually , I think Bill and I are sort of old-fashioned , " she says . " We chose old-fashioned names for the babies , because those were the names we liked . We enjoy the land ? I guess that 's oldfashioned today . We like old friends . and just to sit around and talk with them . We 're happy with what we 've got . That in a way is the most old-fashioned of all .
