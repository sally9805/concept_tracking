" All right , " Peter said curtly , " I do n't want heroes , just the contents of the safe . " <P> At first glance , this description of the espionage burglary of a government office building , contained in a yellowing 1965 paperback called On Hazardous Duty , might seem to be a rather ordinary experience in the life of Ace CIA Agent Peter Ward . As the star of a series of fictional thrillers by David St. John , Ward has had far more exciting adventures . There was the time , for instance , when he was assigned to verify the identity of the man with the scarred face who was returning from 20 years in Soviet slave labor camps to claim the throne of Spain .

Howard Hunt , the convicted Watergate conspirator . <P> During the past 30 years , 20 of them spent working for the CIA , Hunt has managed to write no fewer than 47 novels under a string of pen names : John Baxter , Gordon Davis and Robert Dietrich , as well as David St. John .

But occasionally his superiors would censor a scene or a theme , he recalled , " and I 'd learn that some episode I thought I 'd made up from whole cloth had described an actual operation-one that I 'd never heard about . " <P> Hunt 's newest novel , The Berlin Ending , is about a Willy Brandt-like character-Klaus Werber , West German Foreign Minister and notorious " anti-Communist cold warrior , " perhaps to be honored with the Nobel Prize and the secretary-generalship of the United Nations . The gimmick : in truth Werber is a Soviet agent .
