" Hey , " asked Cosmonaut Vladislav Volkov , 35 , " do you see what he 's doing ? " Before mission control could answer , Volkov 's commander , Lieut . Colonel Georgy Dobrovolsky , 43 , appeared on Moscow TV screens . He was playfully floating on his back in the zero gravity of space and pumping his legs as if he were pedaling a bicycle . Then , while all Russia watched , Volkov accidentally released a picture of Lenin , letting the father of the Soviet state drift aimlessly around the spacecraft . <P> Orbital Acrobatics . If the behavior of the three cosmonauts aboard the Soviet Union 's huge Salyut spacecraft last week seemed exuberant , there was good reason . In the past few weeks the Soviet space program has enjoyed a remarkable string of successes . Even while the cosmonauts performed their orbital acrobatics , the rugged little unmanned Russian moon rover , Lunokhod , came back to life and resumed its patrols for the eighth consecutive two-week-long lunar day . Farther out in space , two Russian spacecraft were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet Mars . But the attention of the world was focused on the orbiting cosmonauts and their achievement : the manning of the first experimental laboratory in orbit around the earth . <P> Ever since they were beaten by the U.S. in the race to land men on the moon , the Russians have been proclaiming the importance of orbiting space stations-as platforms to survey the earth , to scan the heavens and eventually to launch manned excursions to the planets . In April the Soviets lofted Salyut , an impressive , 171-ton unmanned collection of scientific instruments ( telescopes , spectrometers and other sensing equipment ) . But the odd , tubular-shaped laboratory , with its stubby , winglike solar panels , settled into such a low initial orbit that its lifetime was reckoned at only a few weeks . Ground controllers eventually raised the orbit a bit , thereby extending Salyut 's life . But the first attempt to dock a manned Soyuz with the ship ran into trouble , and the cosmonauts returned abruptly to earth . <P> Very Bright Flash . Last week in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Equipped with improved docking mechanism , the 71-ton spaceship rendezvoused with Salyut after 24 hours . With Test Engineer Viktor Patsayer , 38 , leading the way , the cosmonauts feigned surprise upon entering Salyut 's large , living-room-size interior , complete with instrument panels , separate compartments , kitchen and housekeeping equipment and even a small library . " This place is tremendous , " said Dobrovolsky . " There seems to be no end to it . " <P> Besides their televised games and bantering , the cosmonauts performed more serious tasks : a number of unspecified biomedical experiments , tests of Salyut 's systems and photography of the earth with an externally mounted TV camera . They also fired the space station 's main engine , an operation accompanied by what Dobrovolsky described as " a very bright flash with a large number of white particles , like a snow blizzard . " After two firings , they managed to raise Salyut 's orbit to 161 by 175 miles . That increased elevation should give the space station at least another month 's life-enough time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
