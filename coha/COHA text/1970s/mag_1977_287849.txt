Some 75 years after its introduction , aspirin remains the world 's leading painkiller , used for easing aches of every type , from headache to hangover , arthritis to athlete 's elbow . <P> Americans alone ingest more than 50 million tablets of aspirin nature a day . In addition , aspirin , known chemically as acetylsalicylic acid , is the primary ingredient-and often the only active one-in nearly 50,000 over-the-counter ( nonprescription ) drugs now available in the U.S. Unlike many other drugs , aspirin is so mild that most people can take it for years in proper doses without suffering any serious problems or developing resistance to it . Even more remarkable , doctors seem to be finding promising new uses for the trusty old remedy-for example , as a possible preventive for heart attacks and strokes ( TIME , April 14 , 1975 ) . <P> Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lately become a subject of considerable controversy .

The Federal Government , which began to crack down on deceptive advertising of over-the-counter drugs by pharmaceutical companies in 1972 , is now threatening other measures as well . <P> In a 1,200-page study on analgesics just released by the FDA , a six-member advisory panel confirms that both aspirin and acetaminophen relieve minor aches and reduce fever , but it also issues a sharp warning against extravagant claims . " Adjective-itis , " FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy calls it , and urges new caveats to protect unwary consumers from potential dangers that could accompany overzealous use of analgesics .
