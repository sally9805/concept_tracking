Whenever the U.S. Government did something he did not like , John L. Lewis , the colorful , powerful president of the United Mine Workers of America , would protest with outraged , rolling rhetoric . Last week his successor , W.A. ( " Tony " ) Boyle , stood wordlessly before a Washington federal jury as he was pronounced guilty of embezzlement , conspiracy and illegally contributing to political campaigns . His silence , compared with Lewis ' bombast , symbolized the fall of a once powerful union to a scandal-ridden ebb of influence . Boyle 's conviction carries a maximum sentence of 32 years in jail and fines of $120,000 . <P> During a two-year period , the U.M.W. improperly passed $49,250 in miners ' money to politicians . Although the Democrats received most of the money , funds went to both parties-not an uncommon hedge for either industry or labor ( see BUSINESS ) . Boyle argued that he was simply following the example of his mentor , Lewis , a onetime political kingmaker who blatantly wielded funds and votes for favored candidates . Boyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union office , although he can not be ousted from his present job and will remain free on bail while his case is appealed . <P> The indictment and conviction of the U.M.W president followed a bloody union election contest between Boyle and Joseph A. ( " Jock " ) Yablonski . Boyle won the election by a 2 to 1 margin , but Yablonski supporters have appealed the result . Less than a month after his defeat , Yablonski , his wife and daughter were murdered . His death has shadowed the union with charges that he was ordered killed after the bitter campaign . <P> No connection has ever been established between the Yablonski murders and Boyle or the U.M.W. , but the resulting publicity helped contribute to Boyle 's downfall . From a post-World War I membership of more than 600,000 , the U.M.W has dropped to 180,000 members ; critics have charged that the union has lagged on safety legislation and failed to push vigorously for black-lung benefits for disabled miners . Autocratic , out of touch , Boyle was left with little defense to offer those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
