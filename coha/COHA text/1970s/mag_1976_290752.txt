When he came to the Books section of TIME in 1974 , Staff Writer Paul Gray carried with him a number of credentials as a reviewer . Among other things , he held a Ph.D . in English literature from the University of Virginia ( subject of his thesis : James Joyce ) , and had taught as an assistant professor at Princeton for seven years . Even so , he found preparing for this week 's cover story on Novelist Gore Vidal to be a rigorous exercise , since his preparations required reading or rereading a 23-volume shelf including 15 novels , various essay collections and other works by his subject . Says Gray : " I came to admire Vidal for his accomplishments in an old but honorable role , the well-rounded man of letters .

It was written by Patricia Blake , a longtime student of the Russian scene who came to TIME as a consultant on Soviet affairs in 1968 . She was assisted by Reporter-Researcher Sara Medina , who earned a degree in Russian at Vassar College and has worked on many stories involving East bloc countries . <P> Our Washington , London and Bonn bureaus contributed files on the Soviet economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moscow Bureau Chief Marsh Clark , whose extensive note taking on Soviet life today began last September , when he joined the American and Russian astronauts who had participated in the Apollo-Soyuz space rendezvous on their seven-city post-mission tour of the Soviet Union .
