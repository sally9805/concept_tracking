Swept by waves up to 90 ft. high and wind gusts of hurricane velocity , Europe 's North Sea is one of the world 's most inhospitable places to look for oil and gas . Since drilling began there more than a decade ago , in a gamble by five nations to wrest black gold from Northern Europe 's front yard , at least 21 lives have been lost in drownings and other mishaps . The North Sea has also been terribly unforgiving of mechanical mistakes . Supporting buoyancy tanks ruptured last year on a new gas-production platform , sending its legs crashing to the seabed-in the wrong place . All efforts to reposition the badly damaged platform have failed , and it will probably have to be blown up to avoid becoming a nuisance to shipping . Estimated cost of the job : $100 million . <P> Such setbacks help to make North Sea 's economic climate as treacherous as its meteorology . Development costs , paced by outlays for labor and expensive equipment ( see color ) , have in many cases doubled , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , costs could reach $35 billion for Britain and Norway alone , or $11 billion more than the U.S. spent to land a man on the moon . Major U.S. oil companies , including Chevron , Amoco , Exxon , Texaco and others are drilling in the North Sea . But rigs are now in surplus , and the pace of exploration is expected to slow . One Norwegian oilman says flatly that " the North Sea is not a bonanza . " <P> Buried Treasure . But the oil exploiters are pressing ahead anyway , perhaps with less euphoria than in earlier years but with more experience , maturity and confidence . Though only a trickle of oil is being pumped now , oilmen expect crude to flow in ever increasing quantities from an undersea supply estimated at 40 billion bbl. , two to four times the recoverable reserves from Alaska 's North Slope . Some experts say the total could be 70 billion bbl. - roughly equal to the so-far proven reserves of Kuwait-or even 150 billion bbl . <P> Whatever the figure , the stakes are high . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national survival , or so politicians have maintained for a decade . It offers an opportunity for Britain to become not only self-sufficient in energy but also a modest exporter , probably in the 1980s , pumping oil revenues into its sick economy , wiping out its balance of payments deficit and reversing 30 years of economic decline . Critics say the oil will afford no such panacea ; they assert that Britain 's problems run deeper than any cure offered by the North Sea . But even they concede that the oil could bring an important economic pick-me-up . <P> For the Norwegians , already rich in money and energy supplies , North Sea oil means a chance to become richer still as the " blue-eyed Arabs of the North . " By the 1980s , Norway could be producing 1.8 million bbl. daily-ten times its domestic needs-and exporting as much oil as Iraq and Libya do now . For the other North Sea participants-Denmark , The Netherlands and West Germany-the waters already promise abundant oil and natural gas . It was in Holland , in fact , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches under the North Sea .
