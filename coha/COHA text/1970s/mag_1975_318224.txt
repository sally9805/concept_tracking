It always seemed like a foolhardy venture : Malcolm Bricklin , 36 , an unconventional millionaire from Philadelphia who sometimes wore Indian beads , thought he could start an auto-manufacturing business from scratch . To the surprise of many , Bricklin , who had made his original fortune running hardware stores , actually acquired two plants in Canada 's New Brunswick province and started making his unconventional Bricklin cars . Now two secured creditors and the New Brunswick government , which had put up more than $20 million in cash and loan guarantees to obtain 67% control of Bricklin Canada Ltd. , have placed the company in receivership , closing the plants . Bricklin himself proclaimed last week at a press conference in Toronto that " the Bricklin car will continue to be built in New Brunswick . " That sounded like whistling in the dark-especially since Bricklin had already gone into a Scottsdale , Ariz. , court to declare himself personally bankrupt . <P> Safety Cage . Bricklin thought he could succeed by selling a car engineered primarily for safety . The Bricklin had retractable bumpers designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles per hour , roll bars that made the passenger compartment a kind of safety cage , and gull-wing doors that opened by swinging up and out of the way of oncoming traffic . Those features were expensive : the car 's price rose from about $8,000 in 1974 to $10,000 this year . Bricklin tried to give the car flash as well as safety appeal ; he made only one model , a sleek sports car . <P> However , nothing went quite right with the car from the start . The two plants , which employed 600 people , were expected to produce 12,000 vehicles a year ; but over the Bricklin 's entire production run , beginning in August 1974 , they turned out only 3,000 cars-most of them exported to the U.S. One trouble was that the Bricklin 's gull-wing doors were electrically operated - and sealed in passengers if the battery ran dead . Some Bricklins arrived at dealers ' with missing parts and simply could not be sold . Deliveries to Bricklin 's 400 dealers were slow and erratic . <P> The receiver , Clarkson Co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next several weeks whether the company can be reorganized . The odds on the Bricklin car rising Phoenix-like , however , are poor . Bricklin claimed last week to have lined up more than $10 million from new U.S. investors , and earnestly solicited an additional $10 million to $15 million from the New Brunswick provincial and Canadian federal governments . But Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau 's administration is cutting its budget to attack inflation and is in no mood to boost new spending . New Brunswick 's Progressive Conservative premier , Richard Hatfield , is under heavy political fire for putting taxpayers ' money into the company in the first place . Malcolm Bricklin is facing the harsh reality that his car is turning out to be something like a new Edsel , which cynics always thought it would be .
