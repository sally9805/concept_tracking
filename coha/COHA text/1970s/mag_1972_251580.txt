More than a decade of large-scale fighting in Southeast Asia has left many Americans with the impression that the war-weary South Vietnamese , if given a free choice , would gladly exchange a military dictatorship in Saigon for a Communist regime if they could get peace in the bargain . To hear some antiwar activists tell it , Hanoi 's forces are benevolent friends of the South Vietnamese population . Well , not quite . The fact is that the North Vietnamese have sometimes been shockingly brutal in their treatment of South Vietnamese who happened to be under their control . <P> During the 1968 Tet offensive , for instance , the Communists executed more than 3,000 South Vietnamese in the former capital of Hue . Even though the brutality has been on a smaller scale during this year 's Easter offensive , the Communists have murdered at least 200 people and imprisoned 6,000 in the Communist-controlled portion of Binh Dinh province . Allied intelligence officials believe that the number executed will surpass 500 before the whole of the province has been retaken by the South Vietnamese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials whom the enemy wanted to eliminate either because they were especially effective in their jobs , or because they were so unpopular that the Viet Cong could win favor by killing them . The primary motive for the show trials and the brutalities , reports TIME Correspondent Rudolph Rauch , " appears to have been to wreck whatever allegiance the government might have built up , and there are few more effective ways of mitigating allegiance than to bury four dozen loyal men alive " - as happened in the town of Bong Son . Some examples : <P> &gt; In Hoai Nhon district , 300 townspeople were herded together in front of a village school and designated a " people 's court . " They were invited to denounce the crimes of a man named Phung Sao , who had been in charge of the town 's military affairs under the Saigon government . A few villagers accused Sao of using his position to assassinate a number of revolutionary cadres . The " president " of the court declared , " The people have decided that Sao will be executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , Sao 's bullet-ridden body was turned over to his widow , who had been obliged to watch both the trial and the execution . <P> &gt;In the middle of a Binh Dinh tea plantation , a Viet Cong court declared that 20 defendants owed a " blood debt to the people . " The result : at a midnight gathering in the local sports stadium , three of the prisoners were shot to death by a Viet Cong platoon leader . The other 17 were given prison sentences ranging from two to five years . <P> &gt; In Vinh Phung hamlet , 42 policemen were reportedly executed in a mass ceremony ; another was beheaded , and his body was hung from a tree beside a police station . A hamlet chief was disemboweled in Kontum.
