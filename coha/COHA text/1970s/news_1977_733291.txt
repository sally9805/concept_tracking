txt SOME TIME SOON , Martha the passenger pigeon may finally fly home to roost . Lloyd 's of London will insure her , she 'll go by first-class jet with an escort , and the future will forge a sad link to the past . Martha has been out of tile news since 1914 when she died at the Cincinnati Zoo . She was 25 years old and the last of her kind  --  and sole remnant of man 's mindless attack on the most bountiful bird ever to soar the earth . Cincinnati residents have been trying to retrieve Martha  --  her stuffing is getting somewhat tacky now  --  from her perch at the Smithsonian . They raised $100,000 to restore the aviary where she died . Called the Passenger Pigeon MemThe list of endangered species , plus illustrations of sonic of the animals , Is on the Back Page . oriel , it recently was dedicated to all extinct , endangered , and threatened wildlife . And It Is designed to serve as a warning to remind mankind of his destruction of the past through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 174 jeopardized species of North American wildlife and 439 foreign species that the Interior Department seeks to preserve . Since 1950 , an estimated 450 species have disappeared mainly plants and mollusks , and by 1980 another 200 may be gone as Americans convert 2,000 acres a day from rural habitat to urban . A CENTURY AGO , North American skies were blackened by traveling flocks of passenger pigeons lectopisies inigra. thrills ! . They blotted out the sun and their great weight bent the branches of immense trees . Naturalist John James Audubon once estimated that one billion birds passed over his head during a day-long migration . In 1871 , some 136 million passenger pigeons concentrated at one Wisconsin nesting site . " But the bird had two great faults , " says naturalist and wildlife artist John Ruthven , a prime mover behind the Cincinnati Martha memorial . " It was beautiful  --  about the size of a turtle dove , with a long wedge-shaped tail  --  and it made delicious eating . It was sought for both flesh and feathers . It also was used for trap-shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were no more . " In only a few decades , professional and amateur pigeon-killers took tens of millions . The last big nesting , in 1870 , north of Petoskey , Mich. , killed million birds . Three freight trains a day left Petoskey packed with salted and iced pigeons for markets in Chicago and New York . " Until finally , only Martha remained . Then she died . NOW , BITTER BATTLES between  --  the exploiters of nature and conservationists have put the government in the middle . The Department of the Interior is trying to solve problems it took nature perhaps three million years of development to work out . Meanwhile , habitats are quickly changed and animals retreat or vanish . But Interior has responded by suddenly growing muscles . The agency , long accused of being a pawn of private interests , has given sharp teeth to a tough law  --  the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . The act banned commerce in threatened and endangered wildlife , both domestic and foreign . It brought federal protection to animals which had large hum an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law fights battle for survival // brown bears , cougars , eagles , and falcons to name but a few . But it also included birds , fish , reptiles , and amphibians that are neither particularly celebrated , cute , nor cuddly  --  the Indiana bat , say . Or the tan riffle shell pearly mussel . Or the homely Florida manatee . TILE LAW has become dynamite , especially since Interior announced plans to list 1,767 plants as endangered , a move which could affect more than 70 federal agencies which build roads , dams , and housing projects , manage public lands , and promote agriculture . Endangered flowers , cacti , shrubs , grasses , ferns , and trees are found in 46 states . " People write off plants when they think of endangered species , " says Interior official Keith M. Schreiner , who supervises the Office of Endangered Species . " Yet many rare insects , snails , and birds are dependent on plants . If the plant goes , so does the animal , and the entire ecosystem is wounded . " Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smithsonian Institution has recommended that 3,187 species of flora be listed to protect them faun strip mining , overgrazing , timber harvesting , suburban development , road construction , flooding , irrigation , steam channeling , fire , and drainage of marshes . The current federal list protects 174 species of wildlife and 439 foreign  --  a total of 613 . Native animals include 35 mammals , 67 birds , 9 reptiles , 4 amphibians , 30 fishes , 22 clams , and 6 Insects . On the list of foreign species are 227 mammals , 144 birds , 46 ' reptiles , 9 amphibians , 10 fishes , 1 snail , and 2 clams . These species can neither be imported into the United States nor can their products be sold . WILDLIFE make the list In several ways : ? Interior consults the Red Data books , an inventory prepared by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources IIUCNI , founded in 1946 by UNESCO and based in Merges , Switzerland . ? Other animals come under the treaty which resulted front the U.S.-initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauna and Flora . ? Anyone  --  conservation group , scientist , government employe  --  can propose a species for protected status . If controversial , a notice of review is published in the Federal Register , additional data is solicited , and a ruling Is made . No species on the list so far has been removed , though occasionally one changes from endangered to threatened ( which really means in imminent danger of being endangered I. The numbers game is one of the most complicated and controversial aspects in all of this . Counting the kill is one way of monitoring , though of dubious value . A California wildlife official was once asked why that state still allowed hunting of cotigars . " How can we count them if we ca n't kill them ? " he responded . But when scientists can determine the remaining numbers in a species , the game is about over . Nobody has spotted an ivory-billed woodpecker for years . It 's probably extinct . EACH ENDANGERED species fights its own lonely battle for survival . If hunters or egg-poisoning pesticides do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If their predators are kited oft , they starve to death . Many , like the giant California condor , die if not simply left alone . The case of the condor typifies federal desperation . Only 40 are known to be alive . In 1975 , a recovery team was formed to try saving the species . There are 58 recovery teams raising , attempting to breed , and translocating such diverse creatures as apache trout , blackfooted ferrets , red wolves ( our most endangered mammal , blunt-nosed lizards , blue pike , Devil 's hole pup fish , Eastern brown pelicans , and red-cockaded woodpeckers . Success has varied . In 1974 , biologists who should have known better , dumped four timber wolves in Upper Michigan , with little thought to the highly refined social structure of any pack and little vitiation of the public . The animals scattered and were promptly killed . And now the Endangered Species Act ? as with most sweeping legislation ? is being picked at by a swarm of lawsuits which threaten to weaken if not kill it .

TILE DARTER was discovered In 1973 by a biologist swimming in the Little Tennessee . It became listed as endangered . The mightly Tennessee Valley Authority was blocked from finishing the Tellico Dam because that would destroy the darter 's only known habitat . The Department of the Interior told the TVA to stop building the dam and start obeying federal law . The TVA went ahead anyway . Since federal agencies can not sue each other , conservationists took the TVA to court and Won . TVA is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court , The darter case , though simple on the surface , represents a deeper malaise . Farmers , trout fishermen , and people who just like to be outdoors never have wanted the Tellico Dam there are 60 others in the areal , The darter and the Endangered Species Act have finally given them a brick to throw at the TVA .
