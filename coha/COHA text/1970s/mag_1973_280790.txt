The scene was Naples , but a Naples that few would recognize . The cafes , the hotels and the markets were eerily quiet and empty . For infection-wary prostitutes , it was never on weekdays as well as Sundays . Sullen crowds milled in the streets , and people eyed each other with suspicion . A placard outside the Zi ' Teresa restaurant - closed by a strike , although there were no customers to speak of anyway - explained the city 's unsettled mood . CHOLERA BROUGHT us TO OUR KNEES , it read , NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE COUP DE GRACE . <P> <P> Normally one of the gayest and most cheerful cities in Europe , Naples has been paralyzed by a cholera epidemic that killed 16 people in a month and hospitalized 822 more . As the epidemic itself waned , misfortune has overwhelmed the city . First the lucrative tourist trade dried up . Then the port was all but quarantined . Fishmongers who sold the sewage-contaminated mussels that spread the infection were virtually ostracized ; their livelihood was ruined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagion , Neapolitans , the most gregarious people in Italy , began to avoid one another , literally like the plague . In the birthplace of the pizza , even mozzarella cheese became an object of suspicion . <P> At the best of times , Neapolitans are looked down on by Northern Italians as lazy and unwashed ( " Africa starts at Naples " is a prejudicial commonplace ) . Since the epidemic began , Neapolitans have been treated with all the warmth and feeling usually accorded lepers . In San Remo recently , a Neapolitan family was turned away from a hotel when 100 other guests threatened to check out en masse . Most mortifying of all , the Genoa soccer team forfeited an Italian championship match rather than play in infected Naples . <P> Rejected by their countrymen , Neapolitans are looking at the shabbiness of their city in a new , unfavorable light . <P> In the teeming slum quarters of the bassi - the cellar houses known in the city as " the low places " - the malaise has brought with it a deep sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk with a whip because the rats are so big , " complained one aging woman as she looked with disgust into an ancient sewer . " Here everything remains the way it was before . " <P> Worst Crisis . In search of a scapegoat , Neapolitans have turned on the politicians , who are being blamed for doing nothing to improve Naples ' woefully antiquated sanitation system . With typical Italian overstatement , the city officials are being referred to as " that band of cuckolds and brigands . " Last weekend a mob of unemployed mussel fishermen assaulted the car of Naples Prefect Domenico Amari as it approached city hall , setting off three days of rioting that resulted in a dozen injuries and eight arrests . Politicians of all shades loudly began accusing one another of negligence and corruption , tossing the blame around like an infected mussel . Exhausted by the uproar , Mayor Gerardo De Michele abruptly resigned last week , taking his administration with him . In the midst of its worst crisis since World War II , Naples found itself without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive investigation that could lead to indictments of several past and present city officials for criminal negligence .
