The President had a choice between two targets when he decided to come out swinging against the opponents of his energy program . He could have taken on the Senate itself or the giant energy combines . He picked the easier one when he charged the oil and gas industry with planning " the greatest rip-off in history . " Carter 's language in his October 13th press conference was quite extraordinary in more than one way . The oil companies naturally called it " intemperate , " but it was indeed extravagant . That is not to say that he was wrong to attack the industry for its grasping and wrong-headed ways . It is simply to note that to talk of " potential war profiteering " when he breaks a silence that has lasted for months as Congress fiddled with his energy scheme is a startling change from the passivity with which he has seemed to watch the dismantling of his proposals . Since we are not at war at the moment , he must have had in mind the energy " war " he personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " the moral equivalent of war " has come back to haunt him , as excessive rhetoric is apt to do . The fact is that , as the legislation went to the House-Senate conference , the President 's energy program was an unrecognizable shambles . The House had passed a bill that was close to Carter 's version of what needed to be done . The Senate 's Finance Committee turned out a monstrosity containing none of the taxes he asked for and $32 billion in tax credits which he did not want . The House emphasis was on conservation , the Senate 's on incentives to more production . The twain could scarcely meet , even in the pressure cooker of a con .. ference committee . However , there will of necessity be some sort of compromise . The question is how much has already been compromised by Carter even before the two chambers begin to adjust their differences . The President sounded almost intransigent at his press conference , but the truth is that he has by now yielded much of his original ground to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas prices in the public interest has almost disappeared . Even before the Senate voted to phase out all price controls on gas over the next few years , Carter 's agents on Capitol Hill were backing a " compromise " regulated price per thousand cubic feet of $2.03 , which is close to what the industry could get if there were no regulation . That figure should be compared with the 60 ? price which the Federal Power Commission called " ample " just last year . So much for the fate of gas prices , and the monopolistic multiplier for oil prices is comparable . In sum , Carter 's " war " to save the country from the disaster of an energy shortage looks like a rout . What about the chances of restoring some form of competition in the highly cartelized energy business and thus getting a grip on these monopolies through the mechanism of price competition ? The name of that game is divestiture and it is one the administration is not going to play . " I do not think that is appropriate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 , speaking of " using divestiture as a club . " There was a time when Schlesinger 's boss thought that divestiture was " appropriate , " at least when he spoke as a campaigner in parts of the country where oil and gas industrialists had no political clout . Carter , as James Flug of the Energy Action Committee pointed out in an article in these pages ( May 28 ) , used to say that he favored a " legal prohibition against ownership of . . . oil and coal " because of the lack of " an adequate amount of competition . " These days any form of divestiture , horizontal or vertical , seems to be out of the question and out the window . Carter 's sudden attack on the energy interests had the flavor but not the substance of Populism ( he 's from the South , is n't he ? ) . He swung from the floor in his attempt to get up from it . The maneuver was such a strain on him that he missed with a haymaker when he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , but instead used the inexact term " income . " That slip left him open to an easy right cross from the oil men ; they could justly accuse him of not understanding the difference between gross and net , thus making him look - foolish . The big question now is whether Carter will follow up his hot rhetoric with some action , whether he will stay firm or talk tough and go on compromising . He should tell Congress that he will accept nothing less than the House version of the energy legislation . He must insist that the money from higher prices go back to the public and not to the energy companies ( for exploration and more production , they claim , never mentioning profit ) . He should draw the line now and inform Congress that the hybrid in the making is a monstrosity he will veto . If he took that firm stand , the people would be on his side . They sense , despite the baffling complexities of the matter , that the energy interests and their friends in Congress are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear signal from the White House pointing the way toward the general interest . One must doubt that it will be forthcoming . As Flug wrote in The Nation last spring , " we had all better keep our hands on our wallets " when it turns out that Carter is a man who " can turn a campaign fudge on gas-price deregulation into a multibillion-dollar commitment to the oil and gas industry , and can transmute a promise to the people to break Big Oil away from Big Coal into a tract against oil-coal separation . " Carter Woos in Vain Aside from his battle with the energy bosses , no President in living memory has courted Big Business as ardently as J. E. Carter . He has wooed the favor of the moguls from Maine to California , and from Wall Street to Wilmington . " Business confidence " has been his grail , but like that holy object of the Middle Ages , it keeps eluding its pursuer , however pure his heart . In this quest , Bert Lance was the Lancelot of the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen began to see him as a rather second-rate knight , if one at all , he was unhorsed . It fell then THE NATioN/October 29 , 1977 upon others to carry on the crusade for the approval of the business community . But the mission has been a failure . The Wall Street Journal of October 17 offers the proof in its lead story , headlined " Rocky Relationship ? Big Business Is Critical Of President , Worries About Economic Goals . . . Temporary Stimulus Feared ; Carter Seeks Closer Ties , And Some Stay Hopeful . " The Journal sf : 4 is full of astonishingly hard language about Carter from the country 's industrial and banking " leaders . " In return for seeking their approbation by setting an extremely conservative course , he is rewarded ? by an " angry corporate executive at the Business Council meeting " ? with the warning that the President " ought to reaffirm his1 Wth in the free-enterprise system . " Students of his fiscal : Acies thus far may be astonished to learn that he has been faithless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not Coolidge some fifty years ago who said that " The chief business of America is busines . " What more do they want , these titans of the economy ? A lot more  --  the quotes go on : " Any ' kind of market can deal with bad news or good news , " said the chairman of Merrill , Lynch 's thundering herd of stockbrokers . " The thing it ca n't deal with is uncertainty . " ( Perhaps he ca n't bear the suspense of waiting to learn whether Carter will or wo n't reappoint Arthur Burns for yet another stretch as chairman of the Federal Reserve , with the same old restrictive hand on the monetary throttle . ) " A disaster " is how David Packard , former Deputy Secretary of Defense , but now back in business as chairman of Hewlett-Packard , describes the Carter energy program , gratuitously ticking off James Schlesinger , his colleague of the Nixon days , as not having " the brains God granted a goose about the way the economic system is supposed to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Wriston of Citicorp , declares that " the business community is looking for a believable , internally logical economic strategy , " which , he says , it " has n't seen yet . " If Carter should go off the reservation and adopt an " internally logical strategy " of full employment , one supposes Wriston would not see it as believable . Speaking of credibility , the chairman of Monsanto finds it " unbelievable that we 've gone through years of prolonged debate and still do n't have a program " on energy . The fact is that during the good old days of Nixon and Ford we did have an energy program : leave it to the Seven Sisters . " What big business wants , " says The Wall Street Journal , " is a relatively simple tax-revision package that includes a net tax reduction of $20 billion to $23 billion , including a $7 billion to $8 billion reduction for business . " That formulation is attributed to Reginald Jones , chairman of General Electric , who adds that " temporary hypos " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raps his gavel and briskly tells the administration that all this should be done by mid-1978 , a date which no other observer of the creaking Congressional dynamo thinks is remotely possible . It is striking that Big Business lectures the government in these aggressive terms , and even more striking that Carter has been listening respectfully to these re-gressive formulations . It has done him and the economy no good . His repeated appeals for " business confidence " have got him , and us , nowhere . His counselors from banking and industry have simply grown bolder and more patronizing . It is time for the President to realize that he has powerful means to influence their behavior , if only he has the will to do it . Unfortunately , there is no sign yet that he dares . Mote in Their Eye The American Bankers Association had a tricky little problem . They had invited Bert Lance to address their convention in Houston at a time when he was still the President 's close friend , trusted adviser and Director of the Office of Management and Budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business community . But when the date rolled around he was out of office , out of favor and just another guy looking for a job in order to pay his creditors . Should the ABA cancel the invitation ? There was no tactful way to do that . so Lance addressed the assembled moneymen , to the intense embarrassment of some of the more sensitive of them , one of whom said Lance had " destroyed the image of banking . " Bankers have never been cultural heroes in this country , so one must wonder what " image " the finicky financiers thought had been tarnished . It seems likely that the policy of urban banks to redline racially mixed neighborhoods , thus denying them loans , would do more to damage their reputations than the open-handed ways of Bert Lance . He , after all , as the Senate hearings showed , was given to ladling out loans like lollipops and he seemed not to care much about repayment ( by others and in his own case ) . What better image could a banker have than as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should worry more about the picture being developed at New York State Senate hearings of the big banks dumping billions of dollars worth of New York City securities as bad risks even as they prepared to unload a new batch of dubious paper on an unsuspecting public . The Lance caper is a flyspeck compared to that blot . Digging for Justice The illicit American activities in Chile before and during the Presidency of Salvador Allende now seem to be as deeply buried by the Carter administration as they were by those of Nixon and Ford . Lamentably , there can be no other explanation for the mixture of skittishness and sloth with which the Justice Department is handling two crucial investigations : those into the assassination of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Karpen Moffitt , and into the perjurious testimony of Richard Helms and high ITT officials ( including the company 's chairman , Harold Geneen ) before two Senate subcommittees . The inquiries are intimately related because they pose the same disagreeable questions . Did U.S. officials , both public and private , commit the highest crime conceivable under international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiding in its overthrow , and thus sharing the responsibility for the murder of its President and the terrorization of its people ? And did the agent of that terror , Augusto Pinochet , arrange for the killing of a major political opponent just blocks from the White House ? The world knows that the answer in both cases is " Yes . " It waits to learn whether and when the Carter administration will lay bare those crimes in order to punish the guilty and discourage their repetition . The most infuriating recent developments  --  nondevelopments , really  --  have come in the Helms/Geneen case . In 1973 both men lied under oath by declaring before Congress that their respective organizations had nothing to do with funneling money to Allende 's opponents in the Chilean Presidential election of 1970 . Two years after the perjury was exposed , no indictments have been returned . The reason for inaction is as glaring as the crime itself : fear of what Helms and Geneen would reveal about American skulduggery  --  and , more to the point , about the men who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to spill every nasty secret in his compendious memory , and to drag down with him a certain Dr. Kissinger , among others . The Washington Establishment has greeted this threat in predictably craven fashion . A recent story by Los Angeles Times reporter Jack Nelson states that Attorney General Bell is under intense pressure from such figures as Nelson Rockefeller and Averell Harriman ( other sources name Clark Clifford as a fellow lobbyist ) to " go easy " on Helms . Incredibly , some journalists of repute have added their voices to the cover-up chorus . Hugh Sidey , Washington bureau chief of Time , has " passionately defended Helms on television and in speeches , " according to Nelson . Eric Sevareid of CBS chimed in at a party , telling Bell , " It would be a shame if Helms is indicted . " Bell plaintively told Nelson he was " doing my best to vindicate the rule of law , " but his " best " has yet to result in an indictment . And still there is no word from Justice on the Letelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , mean that the sleuths were painstakingly developing a case , since they almost certainly know who the murderers are . But Letelier 's colleagues at the Institute for Policy Studies fear otherwise , we suspect with reason . They have organized a campaign to demand action , saying , " We are convinced that without sustained public pressure the murderers of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt will go unpunished . " Implied is the correct judgment that the Letelier investigation , like the Helms case , is wholly a political matter in which abstract considerations of justice play little part . And public opinion is the key to politics . The address of the Institute for Policy Studies is 1901 Q Street , N.W. , Washington , D.C. 20009 . Blue Monday Given the reputations of the Houston police in the black and Chicano communities , the Torres murder case was unusual only because it was brought to trial , and because two of the policemen involved decided to testify against their colleagues . The case came to its outrageous conclusion  --  temporary , it is to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-white jury convicted two WATERTOWN P : . - . G ! 1 " , ... , .. L L : . %12 , : , WATERTOWN , S. OAK . Val Houston policemen of negligent homicide , a misdemeanor , for the death of a Chicano , Joe Campos Torres . The guilty parties will pay a fine of $1 each . According to the story of the officers who took the stand , a gang of cops picked up the drunken Torres after a brawl and beat him senseless . They then took him to the station house for booking , but the officer in charge refused to admit him , suggesting that he required hospitalization . Instead , the cops threw Torres off an embankment into a bayou , where he drowned . For their part , the convicted men claimed that Torres provoked a fight , then jumped into the water , and was last seen swimming into the dark . The jury accepted this tale . Not only the contradictory testimony from policemen who were eyewitnesses to the homicide but the entire history of the Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city 's District Attorney has developed cases of murder or attempted murder by police an astonishing twenty-four times in the last four years , but the county grand jury has returned only one indictment . Even the Mayor , Fred Hofheinz , says that the tendency of Houston 's white citizenry to condone police violence amounts to " an illness . " For that reason he says a civilian review board would be worse than useless . However , there is a path to at least partial reform : federal intervention . The Justice Department 's civil rights division was investigating brutality in the Houston department even before the Torres case went to trial , and the guilty cops can still be tried on federal charges of violating Torres 's civil rights , a crime that can carry heavy penalties . An important precedent was set this month when a former Texas police chief was convicted on such charges after having received an absurdly light sentence in a local trial for murdering a Chicano prisoner . Attorney General Bell should now move swiftly to demonstrate that , although the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nation as a whole will not . Meet Me at Jimmy 's In the last week or ten days , several of us here at The Nation have received a nice personal letter from a chap in Washington who signs himself Jimmy , inviting us to join The President 's Club . ( One colleague has , as of this moment , received the letter eight times , and we now refer to him all questions relating to the mores of clubdom . ) At first glance , we assumed that The President 's Club must be one of those exclusive airport waiting rooms , where first-class passengers can have drinks brought to their Barcaloungers while apprentice hostesses manicure their nails ( we have never been in one of these sanctums , so can not swear to the exact amenities ) . It turns out , however , that a President 's clubmate is one who contributes $15 or more to the Democratic Party 's war chest for next , year 's Congressional election . The donor then receives a " membership card , " entitling him or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she is indeed a member of the Democratic Party . Enclosed with the letter is a flier that features two graphs , one showing the relative affluence today of the Democrats and the Republicans , and the other what that relationship might be if we all flock to Carter 's club . In each case , the column on the left is topped by the bust of a wavy-haired fellow with ruggedly lined face and a scarf tucked neatly into his open collar  --  obviously a man who knows how good a cigarette can taste . His opposite number wears his hair in a close-clipped pompadour , has jug ears , glasses so opaque that his eyes are quite invisible and a stringy neck tightly bound by a stiff collar . He is the very distressing image of a mad geneticist with laboratory facilities in some remote Carpathian valley . We certainly would not be quick to join any club he might sponsor . The other one , the outdoor type , who is seen here accepting with dignified gratitude the dollars being held up to him by outstretched hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening at the bar of The President 's Club . However , we 're holding off a bit to see what token of membership we might get by contributing $15 , if not more , to the Free Silver Party . Perhaps a bottle of snake oil .
