" If Cambodia falls , we 'll all feel very bad . " So said a Pentagon official last week as the Ford Administration pleaded with a reluctant Congress to vote $222 million in extra military aid for the Phnom-Penh government . In defense of their request , White House officials and Cabinet members trotted out several arguments . Most compelling was the warning that without an emergency infusion of ammunition , the government of President Lon Nol is in imminent danger of falling to the Communist-led Khmer Rouge insurgents . " An independent Cambodia can not survive unless the Congress acts very soon to provide supplemental military and economic assistance , " President Ford wrote to House Speaker Carl Albert , adding that " if additional military assistance is withheld or delayed , the government forces will be forced , within weeks , to surrender to the insurgents . " <P> Secretary of State Henry Kissinger weighed in by raising the old specter of falling dominoes . " I know it is fashion able to sneer at the words domino theory , " Kissinger told a Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one nation fell to Communism , it would cause other countries around it to fall also . The Secretary went on to argue that " we can not escape this problem by assuming the responsibility of condemning those who have dealt with us to a certain destruction . " The Administration is concerned not only with dominoes falling in Southeast Asia but also with the ripple effect that abandoning Cambodia would have on American credibility . <P> The Administration 's arguments , while valid up to a point , are not totally convincing . For one thing , some Administration officials privately concede that the present government will probably fall sooner or later ; to avoid any appearance of abandoning an ally , they would prefer to give it the extra aid anyway . U.S. policymakers , however , want to separate Cambodia from Viet Nam , where , the Administration feels , greater stakes are involved . It thus wants to convince the legislators that the extra $300 million of military aid to comparatively strong and well-equipped South Viet Nam would be of real help to Saigon in resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Kissinger implied , might well enhance the prospects for an eventual Communist victory in South Viet Nam . Still , Vietnamese Communists have been able to put enormous pressure on Saigon even with Phnom-Penh in Lon Nol 's hands , and the fall of his government is not likely to make a crucial difference . Beyond that , there remain obstacles to the spread of Communist influence in Southeast Asia . Neighboring Thailand , presumably the next endangered domino , is well equipped to resist Vietnamese influence . Communist insurgents in the northeast have achieved little so far , and Thailand has sufficient economic and military strength-including 25,000 U.S. military personnel and 350 aircraft-to successfully counter any threat from outside . <P> ?
