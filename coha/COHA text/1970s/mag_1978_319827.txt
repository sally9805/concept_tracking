First the good news for American League pitchers : Jim Rice does not try to hit home runs . Now for the bad news : he hits home runs anyway , often enough so far to titillate the statistics keepers . The Boston Red Sox 's splendid young designated hitter and leftfielder has hit 18 home runs through the end of May and is ahead of both Babe Ruth 's and Roger Maris ' early-season pace . It was enough to earn him the American League 's Player of the Month award . To add consistency to insult , Rice 's .343 batting average would satisfy Pete Rose . <P> But it is power , lean-muscled , quick-wristed power , that stirs excitement when Jim Rice comes to the plate . In Fenway Park , where the fans have a connoisseur 's appreciation of the slugger 's art , the cheers begin when he strides to the on-deck circle . Rice has sparked Boston to its best start since 1946 , when Ted Williams and Dom DiMaggio returned from World War II to win the first Red Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " They can be down six runs in the ninth inning , but if Rice still has a chance to bat , nobody leaves . " <P> What crowds wait to see is one of the smoothest righthanded swings in recent baseball memory . With his bat held letter high and his head arched over a cocked shoulder , Rice explodes with a compact swing . Says he : " My strength comes from my wrists and legs . But then I bring my left shoulder back so that , all my momentum jumps out to the ball . It 's like a rattlesnake - he coils and then he springs out . " Rice springs eternal : his force is lethal to pitchers , who admit that the rattlesnake swing is the most formidable in the big leagues . <P> The gifts were apparent from the beginning . After starring in four sports for Anderson , S.C . ' s Westside and Hanna high schools , Rice signed with the Sox and spent four years in the minors . In his last year at Triple A in Pawtucket , R.I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home runs and RBIs , a performance that made him minor league Player of the Year . When he joined the Red Sox full time in 1975 , he was 22 and a born star . From the third week of the season until he broke his finger at season 's end , Rice was Boston 's starting leftfielder . He batted .309 with 22 home runs and 102 RBIS and fielded without an error in 144 games protecting Fenway 's famous wall . But 1975 was also the year the centerfielder Fred Lynn became the first rookie MVP in baseball history , hitting .331 with 105 RBIS . Jim Rice 's remarkable season had been eclipsed . It finished with a severe hand injury . The also-ran watched the play-offs and World Series from the dugout . <P> The worst was yet to come . When he arrived at spring training the following year , Rice was removed from left field , and Carl Yastrzemski returned to his old haunts from first base . Rice became the designated hitter , and while he still stroked 25 home runs , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose just sitting on the bench waiting to bat in the first , fourth and eighth innings , " analyzes Rice . " Staying in the game mentally is even harder . "
