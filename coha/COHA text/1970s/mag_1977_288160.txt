Miniracing with minimal risk <P> Vroom ! ... Aargh ! ... Eeesh ! ... Careening out of a 180 hairpin bend , engine screaming at 6,800 r.p.m. and rear wheels adrift , the smoking blue racing machine slides perilously close to the curve , then barrels into a straightaway . " C'm on now , " the driver growls through gritted teeth . " Punch that pedal ! Now feather the gas ! Hug that curve like your darlin ' .. . ! " <P> The driver is not Mario Andretti or even Walter Mitty . He is a thrill-seeking visitor at Northridge , outside Los Angeles , one of seven sites in California where anyone with a driver 's license and a few dollars can safely savor some of the adrenaline-pumping , gut-clutching fever of Grand Prix racing-on a minitrack , in a scaled-down Formula 1 speedster . Le petit Grand Prix is already one of the hottest pastimes in California , the nation 's begetter of vogues , and is spreading east . The two businessmen who laid out the first track in Malibu 29 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $4 million . <P> Malibu Grand Prix is the name of the game , and it is not tame-though it may be less hazardous than roller-coaster riding . No mini-Mario has been killed or seriously injured in the 6 million Malibu laps to date ( though one nervous driver sprained a finger on the steering wheel , and several speeders have crashed through a fence ) . After buying tickets ( $1.25 a lap ) and getting instructions on safety regulations and the operation of the car , drivers buckle into Bell helmets and safety belts to await the red , amber and green signal light at the starting line . There is no wheel-to-wheel competition : each car is electronically released , at nine-second intervals , if the track is clear . But when the light turns green and the engine revs up for the first sneaky curve , it could be Le Mans or Monte Carlo . <P> The half-mile track is a series of tight , tough curves-carrousels , S 's , hairpins and hard rights and lefts-30 in all , with only 80 meters of straightaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach 40 m.p.h. , to the driver , with eyes only three feet above the asphalt , the sensation , if not the speed , is supersonic . He is competing with the clock . As he crosses the finish line , his time is shown in lighted , 2-ft. - high digital figures . First time around it may be a humiliating 98.46 sec . After a few more heart-in-mouth laps , it may be 66.11 . But our hero-or heroine-knows well that the record for the Northridge track is 57.15 . <P> The cars can do it if the drivers can not . Custom-built for $15,000 apiece , they are three-quarter-size versions of the Formula 1 racer , powered by 28-h.p . Wankel rotary engines capable of 67 m.p.h. on the open road . The brightly colored Fiberglas bodies are mounted on tubular-frame chassis ; spun-aluminum wheels carry oversize Goodyear racing-slick tires . They have automatic transmission and quick-ratio steering ; brakes are front-wheel disc and rear-wheel drum . The cars are almost impossible to roll over .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
