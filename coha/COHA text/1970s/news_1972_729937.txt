The pilot reported that the hijacker had demanded that he be given a car equipped with a police radio , and that he planned to keep the stewardess with him as hostage .

He was holding the stewardess , Eileen , at gunpoint  --  and possibly also threatening to blow up the plane with a bomb ? in the main cabin of the Fairchild-Hiller . Meanwhile , the pilot , Capt . Carl Reith , and the co-pilot , William O'Hara , had barricaded themselves in the cockpit . They communicated with the stewardess and the hijacker by loudspeaker and intercom , and with the airport tower by radio .

And , by 9 P.M. , eight parachutes had been delivered to officials at the airport by their Military Airlift Command , The money arrived atabout 12:35 A.M.

" He wants us to put the money and the chutes where he can see it . " And a little later , in response to a ninquiry about the possibility of someone boarding the plane through the co-pilot 's window , Captain Reith repeated , : " He has a gun on Eileen . " Just before 2 A.M. , lie told the tower : " He said lie 's going to give us two minutes to get off , and he 'll disarm I he bomb after we get airborne .

" After circling over the airport for about 20 minutes , the pilot headed toward Scranton , Pa. , and then turned toward Pittsfield , Mass . Asked shortly before take-off whether he had been given a destination , he said : " The only instruction we have so far is not to go above 15,000 feet . " The 42 other passengers aboard the 48-passenger plane were allowed to disembark when the plane landed at the county airport in Purchase , N.Y. , about 6:45 P.M. The flight had been scheduled to arrive at LaGuardia Airport in Queens at 6:57 P.M. The hijacker , described by the pilot as " a little on the feminine side " and " kind of stocky , " did not tell the pilot where he wanted to go .

There was also considerable hack-and-forth talk about the possibility of a successful attack on the plane , probably by F.B.I . agents . Just after the parachutes arrived , the tower acknowledged the pilot 's request " that no one go near the aircraft " but asked whether it would be " any problem for you " if two " fellows " were abe to get underneath the plane from the rear . " Tell them to wear sneakers or something , " the captain said . " A ittle while ago a wind blew , and he swore someone was trying to get on board . " He later cautioned the tower that the man was at least in his late 30 's ? " so we 're not dealing with a kid . " As for the stewardess , he said , " She 's handling it great . " Captain Reith said he had " peeked out once and he the hijacker has a gun in his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen . " The hijacker apparently claimed to have a bomb , but described the blanket-wrapped device variously as a timing device and as a " pressure bomb " that would be set off when the plane reached certain altitude , and as being an impact bomb . At one point , the captain said , the stewardess reported " he put an emery board between the fuses , " later amended to " between firing pins . " The hijacker , Captain Reith reported , warned that " no one should jar the airplane , otherwise it would go up . " Describing the hijacker 's demands , the captain continued : " He also wants a definite time that they 'll bring the money . We said we 're , working on it .

He also turned down a re-. quest that an expert be sent to the plane to instruct the stewardess , who had never made a parachute jump . The hijacker claimed expert status . At about II P.M .. the captain reported that the hijacker said he had an accomplice in the vicinity of the airport who was monitoring the cockpit-tower radio . The hijacker also demanded that the captain flash the plane 's tail lights , which he said was a signal to the accomplice that all was going well . The tower told the captain that " If worse comes to worse , and , we have to become airborne , NORAD North American Air Defense Command is sending two chase planes . You 'll have company in flight .
