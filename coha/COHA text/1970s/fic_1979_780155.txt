 | but if Bull was dissatisfied with it he gave no indication . As a matter of fact he probably was content , for he was a hard rider and he liked to be off alone . A trait that had always been a matter for comment and some conjecture . More than one had asked himself or a neighbor what Bull found to do that took him off by himself so often . There are those who can not conceive that a man can find pleasure in his own company , or in that of a good horse and the open . The mouth of Cottonwood Canyon lay a good twenty miles from the ranch and the head of it five miles of rough going farther . It was ten o'clock when Bull suddenly drew rein beside the lone cottonwood that marked the entrance to the canyon and gave it its name . He sat motionless , listening intently . Faintly , from far up the canyon , came the staccato of rifle shots . How far it was difficult to judge , for the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of their origin , however , the man urged his pony into a gallop , turning his head up the canyon . As the last of the cow hands loped away from the ranch upon the business of the day Elias Henders turned back toward the office , while Hal Colby caught up two ponies which he saddled and bridled , humming meanwhile a gay little tune . Mounting one , he rode toward the ranch house , leading the other , just as Diana Henders emerged from the  | interior , making it apparent for whom the led horse was intended . Taking the reins from Colby , the girl swung into the saddle like a man , and she sat her horse like a man , too , and yet , though she could ride with the best of them , and shoot with the best of them , there was nothing coarse or common about her . Some of the older hands had known her since childhood , yet even that fact , coupled with the proverbial freedom of the eighties in Arizona , never permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few girls in that wild country either overlooked or accepted as a matter of course . Men did not curse in Diana 's presence , nor did they throw an arm across her slim shoulders , or slap her upon the back in good fellowship , and yet they all worshipped her , and most of them had been violently in love with her . Something within her , inherently fine and noble , kept them at a distance , or rather in their places , for only those men who were hopelessly bashful ever remained at a distance from Diana where there was the slightest chance to be near her . The men often spoke of her as a thoroughbred , sensing , perhaps , the fine breeding that made her what she was . Elias Henders was one of the Henders of Kentucky , and , like all the males of his line for generations , held a degree from Oxford , which he had entered after graduation from the beloved alma mater of his native state , for the very excel-  | lent reason that old Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , had been an Oxford man and had seen his son and his grandson follow his footsteps . Twenty-five years before Elias Henders had come west with John Manill , a class-mate and neighbor of Kentucky , and the two young men had entered the cattle business . Their combined capital managed to keep them from the embarrassments and annoyances of a sheriff 's sale for some three years , but what with raiding Apaches , poor rail facilities and a distant market , coupled with inexperience , they were at last upon the very brink of bankruptcy when Henders discovered gold on their property . Two years later they were rich men . Henders returned to Kentucky and married Manill 's sister , and shortly afterwards moved to New York , as it was decided that the best interests of the partnership required an eastern representative . Manill remained in Arizona . Diana Henders was born in New York City , and when she was about five years old her mother contracted tuberculosis of the lungs . Physicians advising a dry climate , Henders and Manill changed places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York with his wife and little daughter . He had married beneath him and unhappily with the result that being both a proud and rather reserved man he had confided nothing to his sister , the wife of his partner and best friend .  | When Diana was fifteen her mother had died , and the girl , refusing to leave her father , had abandoned the idea of finishing her education in an eastern college , and Elias Henders , loath to give her up , had acquiesced in her decision . Qualified by education as he was to instruct her , Diana 's training had been carried on under the tutorage of her father , so that at nineteen , though essentially a frontier girl unversed in many of the finer artificialities of social usage , she was yet a young woman of culture and refinement . Her music , which was the delight of her father , she owed to the careful training of her mother as well as to the possession of a grand piano that had coma over Raton Pass behind an ox team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her music and her horses constituted the life of this young girl ; her social companions the young vaqueros who rode for her father , and without at least one of whom she was not permitted to ride abroad , since the Apaches were still a menace in the Arizona of that day . And so it was that this morning she rode out with the new foreman . They walked their horses in silence for a few minutes , the man 's stirrup just behind that of the girl , where he might let his eyes rest upon her profile without detection . The heavy lashed eye , the short , straight nose , the patrician mouth and chin held the adoring gaze of the young foreman in mute worship ; but it was he who , at length , broke the silence .  | " You ai n't congratulated me yet , Di , " he said , " or maybe you did n't know ? " " Yes , I knew , " she replied , " and I do congratulate you ; but I can not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's his own fault . A man that ca n't keep sober ca n't be trusted with a job like this . " " He was a good foreman . " " Maybe so  --  I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' about a man that 's down . It seems to me you set a lot of store by him , though ; and what do you know about him ? You ca n't be too careful , Di . There 's lots of bad ' uns in these parts and when a feller never talks none , like him , its probably because he 's got something on his mind he do n't want to talk about . " " I thought he was your friend , " said the girl . Colby flushed . " He is my friend . I set a lot of store by Bull ; but it 's you I 'm thinkin ' of  --  not him or me . I would n't want nothin ' to happen that you 'd have to be sorry about . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his chaps with the lash of his quirt . " Oh , pshaw , Di , " he parried , " I do n't want to say nothin ' about a friend . I only want to put you on your guard , that 's all . You know there ai n't nothin ' I would n't do for you=no , not even if it cost me all the friends I got . " He passed his reins to his right hand and reaching across laid his left across one of hers , which she quickly withdrew .  | " Please do n't , " she begged . " I love you , Di , " he blurted suddenly . The girl laughed gaily , though not in derision . " All the men think they do . It 's because I 'm the only girl within miles and miles . " " You 're the only girl in the world  --  for me . " She turned and looked at him quizzically . He was very handsome . That and his boyish , laughing manner had attracted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and openness about him that appealed to her , and of all the men she knew , only excepting her father , he alone possessed anything approximating poise and self-confidence in his intercourse with women . The others were either shy and blundering , or loud and coarse , or taciturn sticks like Bull , who seemed to be the only man on the ranch who was not desperately in love with her . " We 'll talk about something else , " she an nounced . " Is n't there any hope for me ? " he asked . " Why yes , " she assured him . " I hope you will keep on loving me . I love to have people love me . " " But I do n't want to do all the loving , " he insisted . " Do n't worry  --  you 're not . Even the cook is writing poems about me . Of all the foolish men I ever heard of Dad has certainly succeeded in corraling the prize bunch . " " I do n't care a hang about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped . " What I want is for you to love me . " " Oh , well , that 's a horse of another color . Now we will have to change the subject . " " Please , Di , I 'm in earnest , " he pleaded ; " wo n't you give me a little to hope for ? " " You never can tell about a girl , Hal , " she said . Her voice was tender and her eyes suddenly soft , and that was as near a promise as he could get . As Bull urged Blazes up the rough trail of Cottonwood Canyon the continued crack of rifles kept the man apprised of the direction of the origin of the sounds and approximately of their ever lessening distance ahead . Presently he drew rein and , pulling his rifle from its boot , dismounted , dropping the reins upon the ground . " Stand ! " he whispered to Blazes and crept forward stealthily . The shooting was close ahead now ? just around the brush covered shoulder of a rocky hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now both hunters and hunted were under cover and thus able to take only occasional pot shots at one another 's refuge . To come upon them directly up the trail in the bottom of the canyon would have been to expose himself to the fire of one side , and possibly of both , for in this untamed country it was easily conceivable that both sides of the controversy might repre-  | sent interests inimical to those of his employer . With this idea in mind the ex-foreman of the Bar Y Ranch clambered cautiously up the steep side of the hill that hid from his view that part of the canyon lying just beyond . From the varying qualities of the detonations the man had deduced that five and possibly six rifles were participating in the affair . How they were divided he could not even guess . He would have a look over the crest of the hog-back and if the affair was none of his business he would let the participants fight it out by themselves . Bull , sober , was not a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muzzle of his rifle ahead of him he came presently to the crest of the narrow ridge where he pushed his way cautiously through the brush toward the opposite side , passing around an occasional huge outcropping of rock that barred his progress . Presently the brush grew thinner . He could see the opposite wall of the canyon . A sharp report sounded close below him , just over the brow of the ridge . In front of him a huge outcropping reared its weather-worn surface twenty feet above the brush . Toward this he crept until he lay concealed behind it . Then , warily , he peered around the upcanyon edge discovering that his hiding place rested upon the very edge of a steep declivity that dropped perpendicularly into the bottom of the canyon .  | Almost below him five Apaches were hiding among the rocks and boulders that filled the bottom of the canyon . Upon the opposite side a single man lay sprawled upon his belly behind another . Bull could not see his face , hidden as it was beneath a huge sombrero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vaquero  --  he might be either an American or a Mexican . That made no difference now , however , for there were five against him , and the five were Indians . Bull watched for a moment . He saw that the Indians were doing all the firing , and he wondered if the man lying across the canyon was already dead . He did not move . Cautiously one of the Indians crept from cove : as the other four fired rapidly at their victim 's position , then another followed him and the three remaining continued firing , covering the advance of their fellows . Bull smiled , that grim , saturnine smile of his . There were some red-skins in the vicinity that were due for the surprise of their lives . The two were working their way across the canyon , taking advantage of every particle of cover . They were quite close to the hiding place of the prone man now  --  in another moment the three upon Bull 's side of the canyon would cease firing and the two would rush their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ris shoulder . There fol-  | lowed two reports , so close together that it was almost inconceivable that they had come from the same weapon , and the two , who had already risen for the final attack , crumpled among the rocks beneath the blazing sun . Instantly apprehending their danger , the other three Apaches leaped to their feet and scurried up the canyon , searching new cover as they ran ; but it was difficult to find cover from a rifle holding the commanding position that Bull 's held . It spoke again , and the foremost Indian threw his hands above his head , spun completely around and lunged forward upon his face . The other two dropped behind large boulders . Bull glanced across the canyon . He saw that the man had raised his head and was attempting to look around the edge of his cover , having evidently become aware that a new voice had entered the grim chorus of the rifles . " Hit ? " shouted Bull . The man looked in the direction of the voice . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you shoot ? There 's only two of them left  --  they 're up canyon on this side . " " Out of ammunition , " replied the other . " Well , you were in a hell of a fix , " mused Bill as he watched the concealment of the two Indians . " Any more of ' em than this , bunch ? " he called across to the man .  | " No . " For a long time there was silence  --  the quiet and peace that had lain upon this age-old canyon since the Creation  --  and that would lie upon it forever except as man , the disturber , came occasionally to shatter it . " I ca n't lie here all day , " mused Bull . He crawled forward and looked over the edge of the cliff , There was a sheer drop of forty feet . He shook his head . There was a sharp report and a bullet tore up the dirt beneath him . It was followed instantly by another report from across the canyon . Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a sign of them showed . One of them had caught him napping  --  that was all  --  and ducked back out of sight after firing , but how was the man across the canyon firing without ammunition ? " I got one then , " came the man 's voice , as though in answer , " but you better lie low ? he come near getting you . " " Thought you did n't have no ammunition , " Bull called across . " I crawled out and got the rifle of one of these you potted . " Bull had worked his way back to his cover and to the brush behind it and now he started up along the ridge in an attempt to get behind the remaining Indian . A minute or two later he crawled again to the edge of the ridge and there below him and in plain  | sight the last of the red-skins crouched behind a great boulder . Bull fired and missed , and then the Apache was up and gone , racing for his pony tethered further up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and sought an easy way down into the bed of the canyon . The other man had seen his action , which betokened that the fight was over , and as Bull reached the bottom of the cliff he was walking forward to meet him . A peculiar light entered the eyes of each as they came face to face . " Ah ! " exclaimed the one , " it is Senor Bull . " He spoke now in Spanish . " Gregorio ! " said Bull . " How 'd they git you in this fix ? " " I camped just above here last night , " replied the other , " and this morning I walked down with my rifle on the chance of getting an antelope for breakfast . They come on me from above and there you are . They been shootin ' at me since early this morning . " He spoke English with scarce the slightest accent . " You have saved my life , Senor Bull , and Gregorio will not forget that . " " You have n't happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " inquired Bull , ignoring the other 's expression of gratitude . " No , Senor , I have not , " replied Gregorio . " Well , I 'll go get my horse and have a look up toward the head of the canyon , anyway , " and Ball turned and walked down to get Blazes.  | Fifteen minutes later , riding up again , he passed Gregorio coming down , the latter having found his pony and his belongings intact at his camp . " A Dios , Senor , " called Gregorio in passing . " So long , " returned the American . At the head of the canyon , where it narrowed to the proportions of a gorge , Bull examined the ground carefully and saw that no cattle had passed that way in many days ; then he turned back and rode down the canyon . Meanwhile , entering Cottonwood from below , Jim Weller , looking for lost horses , passed Gregorio coming out and , recognizing him , loosened his gun in its holster and kept one eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder of the hill that flanked the east side of the entrance to the canyon , for Gregorio bore an unsavory reputation in that part of the country . He was an outlaw with a price upon his head . " Howsumever , " mused Weller , " I ai n't lost no outlaws  --  it 's hosses I 'm lookin ' for , " and he rode on with a sigh of relief that there was a solid hill between him and Gregorio 's deadly aim . Ten minutes later he met Bull coming down from the head of Cottonwood . The two men drew rein with a nod . Weller asked about horses , learning from Bull that there was no stock above them in Cottonwood , but he did not mention having met Gregorio . It was obvious to him that the two men could not  | have been in Cottonwood together without having met and if Bull did not want to mention it it was evident that he had some good reason for not doing so . It was not the custom of the country to pry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregorio nor did he speak of their brush with the Apaches ; but that was because he was an uncommunicative man . " I think I 'll have a look up Sinkhole Canyon for them hosses , " remarked Weller . Sinkhole was the next canyon west . " Keep your eyes peeled for them Crazy J cows , " said Bull , " and I 'll ride up Belter 's and if I see your horses I 'll run ' em down onto the flat . " They separated at the mouth of Cottonwood , Weller riding toward the west , while Bull made his way eastwardly toward Belter 's Canyon which lay in the direction of the home ranch . Three hours later the semiweekly stage , careening down the North Pass trail , drew up in a cloud of dust at the junction of the Henders ' Mine road at a signal from one of two men sitting in a buckboard . As the stage slowed down one of the men leaped to the ground , and as it came to a stop clambered to the top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gruff jest . The new passenger carried a heavy sack which he deposited between his feet . He also carried a sawed-off shot gun across his knees . " The Saints be praised ! " exclaimed a fat lady  | with a rich brogue , who occupied a seat inside the coach . " Sure an ' I thought we were after bein ' held up . " An old gentleman with white whiskers down which a trickle of tobacco juice had cascaded its sienna-hued way reassured her . " No mum , " he said , " thet 's the messinger from the mine with a bag o ' bullion . This here stage ai n't been held up fer three weeks . No mum , times ai n't what they uset to be with all these here newfangled ideas about reform what are spilin ' the country . " The fat lady looked at him sideways , disdainfully , and gathered her skirts closer about her . The stage lurched on , the horses at a brisk gallop , and as it swung around the next curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her bonnet tilting over one eye , rakishly . " Be off wid ye ! " she exclaimed , glaring at the little old gentleman , as though the fault were all his . She had scarcely regained her own side of the seat when another , and opposite , turn in the road precipitated the old gentleman into her lap . " Ye spalpeen ! " she shrilled , as , placing two fat hands against him , she thrust him violently from her . " Sure , an ' it 's a disgrace , it is , that a poor widdy-lady ca n't travel in pace without the loikes o ' ye takin ' advantage o ' her weak an ' unprotected state . " The little old gentleman , though he had two huge  | guns strapped at his hips , appeared thoroughly cowed and terrified  --  so much so , in fact , that he dared not venture even a word of protest at the injustice of her insinuations . From the corners of his weak and watery blue eyes he surveyed her surreptitiously , wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shrank farther into the corner of his seat . A half hour later the stage swung through the gap at the foot of the pass . Before it lay the rolling uplands through which the road wound down past the Bar Y ranch house and the town of Hendersville on the flat below . The gap was narrow and winding and the road excruciatingly vile , necessitating a much slower pace than the driver had been maintaining since passing the summit . The horses were walking , the coach lurching from one chuck-hole to another , while clouds of acrid dust arose in almost vapor lightness , enveloping beasts , vehicle and passengers . Through the nebulous curtain rising above the leaders the driver saw suddenly materialize the figures of two men . " Halt ! Stick ' em up ! " The words snapped grimly from the taller of the two . The messenger on the seat beside the driver made a single move to raise his sawed-off shot gun . A six-gun barked and the messenger toppled forward , falling upon the rump of the near wheelhorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar . The driver attempted to quiet him . The  | two men moved up beside the stage , one covering the driver and a passenger on top , the other threatening the two inside . The fat lady sat with her arms folded glaring at the bandit . The little old gentleman 's hands touched the top of the stage . " Stick ' em up ! " said the bandit to the fat lady . She did not move . " Sure an ' I 'll not stick ' em up an inch fer the loikes o ' yese , " she shrilled ; " an ' lucky it is for ye , ye dhirty spalpeen , that Mary Donovan has n't the bit ov a gun with her  --  or that there ai n't a man along to protect a poor , helpless widdy lady , " and she cast a withering glance of scorn in the direction of the little old gentleman , who grew visibly red through the tan of his weather-worn countenance . The other bandit stepped to the hub of the front wheel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't move , or look back , for five minutes , " he admonished them , " then pull yer freight . " The two then backed away up the road behind the stage , keeping it covered with their guns . The messenger lay in the road moaning . The fat lady unfolded her arms , opened the door and stepped out . " Get back there , you ! " called one of the bandits . " Go to the divil ! " retorted Mary Donovan , as she stooped beside the wounded messenger . The man opened his eyes and looked about , then  | he essayed to rise and with Mary Donovan 's help came to his feet . " Jest a scratch , me b'y , " she said in a motherly tone as she helped him to the stage . " Yell be all right the mornin ' . Git a move on ye inside there , ye ould woman with the artiIery , " she yelled at the little old gentleman , " an ' give this b'y a hand in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bandits were still in sight , but they had not molested her  --  doubtless because she was a woman and unarmed ; but no more had she deposited the messenger upon the seat than she turned upon the old man and wrenched one of his guns from its holster . " Drive like the divil , Bill , " she cried to the driver , sticking her head out of the window , and as he whipped up his team she turned back toward the two bandits and opened fire on them . They returned the fire , and the fusillade continued until the stage disappeared in a cloud of dust around a curve below the gap , the old gentleman and the passenger on top now taking part in the shooting .  | CHAPTER III SUSPICIONS AS THE stage swirled through the dusty street of Hendersville an hour later and drew up before The Donovan House the loiterers about the hotel and the saloons gathered about it for the news and the gossip from the outer world . Gum Smith , sheriff , was among them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the driver called to him . " They bored Mack . " Mary Donovan and the little old gentleman were assisting the . messenger from the stage , though he protested that he was all right and required no assistance . As the woman 's eyes alighted upon the sheriff , she turned upon him , her arms akimbo . " Sure , yese a fine spicimin uv a sheriff , Gum Smith , that ye are  --  not ! " she yelled in a voice that could be heard the length of the single street . " Three holdups in the two months right under yer nose , and all ye do is depatize ' an " depatize ' an ' depatize . ' Why do n't ye git out an ' git ' em ? ye ould woman , " she concluded scornfully , and then turning to the wounded man , her voice instantly as soft as a lullaby . " Get inside wid ye , ye poor b'y , an ' Mary Donovan 'll be after makin ' ye comfortable ' til we get  | hould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he ai n't , or I 'm no lady , which I am . Come on now , aisy like , there 's a good b'y , " and she put a motherly arm about the lad and helped him to the porch of the hotel , just as Diana Henders appeared from the interior , attracted by the sounds from without . " Oh , Mrs. Donovan ! " she exclaimed . " What has happened ? Why , it 's Mack ! The Black Coyote again ? " she guessed quickly . " Shure an ' it was none other . I seen him wid me own eyes  --  the black silk handkerchief about the neck uv him an ' another over his ugly face . An ' his pardner ? sure now I could n't be mishtaken wid the rollin ' walk uv him  --  if it was n't that dhirty greaser , Gregorio , me name 's not Mary Donovan , which it is . " Together the two women helped the messenger into a bedroom where Mary Donovan , despite the embarrassed protests of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana Henders went to the kitchen for hot water and cloths . Mack had an ugly flesh wound in his side , and this they had cleansed as best they could by the time the doctor arrived  --  a drink-broken old man who had drifted in from the East . His knowledge and skill were of the first rank and Hendersville boasted that it owned the best doctor in the Territory  --  when he was sober . In Gum 's Place  --  Liquors and Cigars  --  the male population was listening to the account of the hold-  | up as expounded by the little old gentleman and the other passenger , the latter being a stranger in the community . It was he who had the floor at the moment . " I never laughed so much in my life , " he averred , " as when the old woman calls the old man here the ould woman with the artillery . ' " The little old gentleman was standing at the bar with a glass of whiskey in his hand . Apparently with a single movement , so swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of the stranger , whipped out both guns and commenced shooting . A stream of lurid profanity accompanied his act , yet through the flood of incoherent obscenity the nub of an idea occasionally appeared , which was to the effect that " no blankety , blank tin-horn could git gay with Wildcat Bob . " Almost instantly , as if a magician had waved his wand , the room , that had been comfortably filled with men , became deserted , as far as human eye could discern , except for the little old gentleman with the tobacco-dewed whiskers . The front door had accommodated some , while heavy pieces of furniture and the bar accounted for the rest  --  all but the stranger with the ill-directed sense of humor . He had gone through the back ! window and taken the sash with him . The shooting over , the company reappeared , grinning . Most of them knew Wildcat Bob . It had been the stranger 's misfortune that he had not .  | " I 'd orter ' a ' bored him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling a fresh glass ; " but I guess I larnt him his lesson . The idear of him a-speakin ' of Mrs. Donovan disrespectful-like like that  --  callin ' her the old woman ' ! Why , she 's the finest lady ever drew breath . " An ' says she to me , says she , Mister Bob , says she , It 's such a relief to have a man like you along when there 's danger , ' says she , but she ca n't stand bloodshed , bein ' that timid and shrinkin ' and she begged me not to start shootin ' at the varmints , otherwise than which I shore would of messed them up somethin ' awful , " interspersed with which were quite two oaths or obscenities to each word . The shooting over and quiet restored , Gum Smith made his belated appearance . At sight of the little old gentleman he smiled affably . " Dog-gone my hide if it ai n't Bob , " he exclaimed , crossing the room with extended hand . " Have a drink on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proffered hand . " I got the dust to cover my own drinks , Mister Sheriff , " he replied , " an ' instid of loafin ' around here buyin ' drinks why ai n't you-all out scoutin ' after that there Black Coyote hombre ? You 're shore a hell of a sheriff , you are , Gum Smith . " " Do n't git excited , Bob , " urged the sheriff , flushing . " Give a man time . Ah got to git me a posse , ai n't Ah ? Thet 's jest what Ah was allowin ' to do right now , an ' Ah 'll start by depatizin ' yo . "  | " You 'll deputize me  --  hell , you will , Gum Smith , " returned the old man with a snort of disgust . " I ben out with you-all before . When you thinks danger 's north you heads south . I had all the travelin ' I wants today . " The sheriff mumbled something beneath his breath and turned away . Some half-hour later he rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of his cronies and leisurely took his way toward the gap . In Mrs. Donovan 's sitting room Mary Donovan sat rocking comfortably and chatting with Diana Henders . Mack had been made as comfortable as circumstances permitted . The doctor had assured them that he was in no danger and had gone his way  --  back to Gum 's Place  --  Liquors and Cigars . " And what are you doin ' in town this day , Diana ? " inquired Mrs. Donovan . " I rode in with Hal Colby , he 's foreman now , " replied the girl . " I wanted to buy a few things while Hal rode on over to the West Ranch . We have some horses over there . He ought to be back any minute now . " " So Colby 's foreman . What 's become of Bull ? quit ? " " He got drunk again and Dad broke him . I 'm so sorry for him . " " Do n't be after wastin ' your pity on the loikes ov him , " advised Mary Donovan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to black your boots , darlin ' . "  | " I do n't understand Bull , " continued the girl , ignoring the interruption . " Sometimes I think he 's all right and then again I 'm afraid of him . He 's so quiet and reserved that I feel as though no one could ever know him , and when a man 's like that , as Hal says , you ca n't help but think that maybe he 's done something that makes him afraid to talk , for fear he 'll give himself away . " " So Hal Colby was after sayin ' that ? Well , maybe he 's right an ' maybe he 's wrong . It 's not Mary Donovan that 'll be sayin ' as do n't know . But this I do be after knowin ' ? they 're both ov thim in love with ye , and " Hush , Mrs. Donovan ! The boys all think they 're in love with me , but I hate to hear anyone else say it seriously . It 's perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any other girl , if she chanced to be the only girl on the ranch , as I am , and pretty nearly the only girl in the county , too . There 's Hal now . I must be going . Good-bye , Mrs. Donovan . " " Good-bye , darlin ' , an ' be after comin ' over again soon . It 's that lonesome here , you never could imagine ! An ' what wid that ould scoundrel back in town again , to say nothin ' ov Gum Smith ! " " What old scoundrel ? " inquired the girl . " Sure , no one else but Wildcat Bob , the spal-peen ! " Diana Henders laughed . " He 's a very persistent suitor , is n't he , Mrs. Donovan ? "  | " Sure he 's a very pestiferous shooter , that 's what he is  --  the ould fool . Actin ' like a wild broth ov a b'y , an ' him sivinty if he 's a day . He ought to be ashamed of himself , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gum Smith ? say , that man 's so crooked ye could pull corks wid him . " The girl was still laughing as she emerged from the hotel and mounted her pony . Hal Colby sat his horse a few yards away , talking with half a dozen men . At sight of Diana Henders he reined about and joined her . " The boys were just telling me about the latest holdup in Hell 's Bend , " he said , as they cantered , stirrup to stirrup , out of town . " How 's Mack ? " " The doctor says he 'll be all right , " replied Diana . " Just a bad flesh wound . I do n't see why something is n't done to put a stop to these holdups . Gum Smith does n't seem to care whether he gets The Black Coyote or not . " " Oh , Gum 's doin ' the best he can , " Colby assured her good-naturedly . " You 're too easy , Hal . You never like to say anything against a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the lives and property of all of us are under Gum Smith 's protection , to a greater or less extent , and if he was the right sort he 'd realize his responsibility and make a determined effort to run down this fellow . " " He went out after him with a posse  --  the boys just told me so . What more can he do ? "  | " It was half an hour or more after the stage pulled in before Gum started , " she retorted . " Does he or anyone else imagine that those two scoundrels are going to wait around the gap until Gum gets there ? And he 'll be back with his posse right after dark . He 'll say he lost the trail , and that 'll be the end of it until next time . " The man made no reply and the two rode on in silence for a few minutes . It was the girl who spoke again first . " I wonder , " she said , " who this Black Coyote really is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coyote , " remarked Colby . " How did they know ? " " The black silk handkerchief he uses for a mask , and the other one about his neck , " she explained . " It must be the same man . Everyone has noticed these handkerchiefs on one of the men in every holdup in Hell 's Bend Pass during the last six months . There is scarce any one that is n't positive that the second man is the Mexican , Gregorio ; but no one seems to have recognized the principal . " " I got my own opinion , " said Colby . " What do you mean ? Do you know who The Black Coyote really is ? " " I would n't want to say that I know , exactly ; but I got my own opinion . " " Well ! " she urged . " I would n't want to mention no names  --  until I was shore . But , " after a pause , " I 'd like to see  | his cayuse . No one ever sees either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid out in the brush alongside the trail ; but I got a guess that if anyone ever seed The Black Coyote 's pony we 'd all know for shore who The Black Coyote is . " She did not insist further when she saw that he was apparently shielding the name of some man whom they both knew , and whom he suspicioned . It was only right that he should do this , she thought , and she admired him the more for it . So they talked of other things as they jogged along the dusty road toward home , the man riding a stirrup 's width behind that he might feast his eyes upon the profile of his companion . As they neared the ranch they saw the figure of a solitary horseman approaching from the north . " Looks like Blazes , " remarked the girl . " It is , " said the man . " I sent Bull up to Cottonwood this morning . I do n't see what he 's doin ' comin ' in from the north . The Cottonwood trail 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back along the foot hill trail , " suggested Diana . " He might , but it 's farther , an ' I never seed a puncher yet that 'd ride any farther than you told him to . " " Bull 's different , " she replied , simply . " If you sent him out for any purpose he 'd accomplish it no matter how far he had to ride . He 's always been a good hand . "  | A moment later the ex-foreman joined them where the two trails met . He accorded the girl the customary , " Howdy , Miss , " of the times , and nodded to Colby . His mount was streaked with sweat and dust . It was evident that he had been ridden hard . " Did you find them cows ? " asked the foreman . Bull nodded . " In Cottonwood ? " " No , Belter 's . " Diana Henders glanced at the foreman as much as to say , " I told you so ! " Then , glancing back at Bull , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , and gave a little exclamation of concern . " Oh , Bull ! " she cried , " you 've been hurt ? that 's blood , is n't it ? How did it happen ? " " Oh , that ai n't nothin ' , Miss , just a little scratch , " and he closed up , like a clam , spurring ahead of them . Neither Colby nor the girl spoke , but both were thinking of the same things  --  that Bull wore a black silk handkerchief about his neck and that Mary Donovan had fired back upon The Black Coyote and his confederate following the holdup in Hell 's Bend earlier in the afternoon . Mrs. Donovan , her hands on her hips , stood just inside the dining room door as her guests filed in for supper that evening and seated themselves at the long deal table covered with its clean red and  | white cloth . She had a good-natured word for each of them , until her eyes alighted upon Wildcat Bob , attempting to sneak in unnoticed behind the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed scornfully . " Ye ould fool  --  yer drunk again . Ta-ake off thim guns an ' give thim to me . " " I have n't had a drink , Mary , " expostulated the old man . " Do n't Mary ' me , ye ould reprobate , an ' be after givin ' me thim guns , quick ! " Meekly he unbuckled his belt and passed it over to her . " I was just bringin ' ' em in to you , Ma ? Mrs. Donovan , " he assured her . " Yed better be . Now go an ' sit down . I 'll feed you this night , but do n't you iver step foot into Mary Donovan 's dining room again in liquor . " " I tell you I ai n't had a drink , " he insisted . " Pha-at ? " The word reeked with disbelief . " Only just a drop to settle the dust after we pulled in , " he qualified his original statement . " Ye must uv been that dusty then ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't talk back . And did ye find yer horses , Jim Weller ? " she inquired of the big man behind whom Wildcat Bob had made his unimpressive entrance . Weller shook his head , negatively , his mouth being full of baked beans .  | " Patches probably run ' em off , " suggested Bill Gatlin , the stage driver . " What with renegades and holdups this country ai n't safe to live in no more , " remarked Mrs. Donovan . " If some of these here would-be bad-men would git out an ' shoot up the bandits and the Injuns instid of shootin ' up saloons , " she stated meaningly , casting a baneful look at Wildcat Bob . " Had n't orter be hard to find ' em , least wise one of ' em , " stated Weller , " when every son-of-a-gun in the county knows who he is . " " Meanin ' ? " inquired the stage driver . " Gregorio , in course , " said Weller . " I seen him comin ' out o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , an ' he was headin ' towards Hell 's Bend  --  him an ' that Bar Y Bull feller . " " You mean them two was together ? " asked Gatlin . " Well , they war n't exactly together . Gregorio comes out fust an ' about five minutes later I meets Bull acomin ' down the canyon ; but they could n't have both been up there without t' other knowin ' it . " " I do n't believe Bull would be doin ' it , " said Mary Donovan . " You ca n't never tell nothin ' about them quiet fellers , " remarked Gatlin , sententiously . There was a pounding of hoofs without , the creaking of leather as men dismounted and a moment later the sheriff and some of his posse entered the dining room .  | " I suppose ye got ' em , Gum Smith , " said Mrs. Donovan , with sarcasm , " or ye would n't be back this soon . " " Ah ai n't no cat , Mrs. Donovan , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . " " Yese ai n't no sheriff nayther , " she shot back . Wildcat Bob succeeded in calling attention to derisive laughter by pretending to hide it . Gum Smith looked at his rival angrily , immediately discovering that he was unarmed . " What 's the matter with the old woman with the artillery  --  is she chokin ' ? " he inquired sweetly . Wildcat Bob went red to the verge of apoplexy , seized a heavy cup half-filled with coffee and started to rise . " Sit down wid ye ! " roared the stentorian voice of Mary Donovan . " I ? " started Wildcat Bob . " Shut up an ' sit down ! " The Wildcat did both , simultaneously . " It 's a sha-ame , that it is , that a respictable widdy lady should be redjuced to fadin ' the likes o ' yese fer a livin ' , " wailed Mrs. Donovan , sniffing , as she dabbed at her eyes with the corner of her apron , " all alone and unproticted as I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe the ground wid the both ov yese . " Wildcat Bob , very red and uncomfortable , ate diligently , his eyes glued to his plate . Well did Mary Donovan know how to handle this terror of  | an earlier day , whose short temper and quick guns still held the respect and admiration of the roughest characters of the great empire of the southwest , but whose heart could be dissolved by a single tear . As for Gum Smith , he was only too glad to be relieved of the embarrassment of the Wildcat 's further attentions and he too gave himself willingly over to peace and supper . For the balance of the meal , however , conversation languished . At the Bar Y Ranch the men sat smoking after the evening meal . Bull was silently puffing upon a cigarette . Hal Colby , always good-natured and laughing , told stories . During the silences Texas Pete strove diligently to recall the half-forgotten verses of The Bad Hombre . But over all there hovered an atmosphere of restraint . No one could have put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things were not as they had been yesterday , or for many days before . Perhaps there was a feeling that an older man should have been chosen to replace Bull , for Colby was one of the newer hands . Without volition and unconsciously the men were taking sides . Some , mostly the men who had worked longest for Renders , drew imperceptibly nearer Bull . Texas Pete was one of them . The others laughed a little louder , now , at Colby 's stories . " By gollies ! " exclaimed Pete , " I remember some more of it :  | " I am the original bad un , I am ; I eats ' em alive an ' I do n't give a damn Fer how fast they come er how many they be ? Of all the bad hombres the wust one is me. ' " sang Texas Pete . " Good night , fellers , I 'm goin ' to turn in. "  | CHAPTER IV " I LOVE YOU " DIANA RENDERS was troubled . Ever since the holdup several days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recollection of the sinister circumstances that pointed an accusing finger at Bull . There had always been a deep seated loyalty existing between the Renders and their employees and this alone would have been sufficient to have brought the girl to arms in the defense of the reputation of any , of her father 's " boys . " In the case of Bull there were added reasons why she could not bear to foster a suspicion of his guilt . Not only had he been a trusted foreman , but there was something in the man himself , or rather in his influence upon the imagination of the girl , that made it almost impossible for her to believe that he had shot Mack Harber , another employee , and stolen the bullion from her father 's mine . He had always been reticent and almost shy in her presence . He had never presumed to even the slight familiarity of addressing her by her given name '  --  a customary procedure among the other men , many of whom had seen her grow so gradually  | from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discerned the change . Yet she knew that he liked to be with her , though she was far from being sure that she cared for his company . He was quiet to taciturnity and far from being the pleasant companion that she found in Hal Colby . There was something , however , that she felt when in his company to a much greater degree than when she was with other men  --  absolute confidence in his integrity and his ability to protect her . Now she was sorry for him since his reduction from a post of responsibility and her loyalty aroused by the inward suspicions she had permitted herself to entertain , to the end that she was moved by something akin to remorse to make some sort of overtures of friendship that he might know that the daughter of his employer still had confidence in him . It was a quiet Sunday morning . The men were lazily occupying themselves with the overhauling of their outfits , replacing worn latigo and stirrup leather lacings , repairing hackamores and bridles , polishing silver and guns , cleaning boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair-cutting . Down past the bunk-house , toward the corrals , came Diana Henders . Presently she would pause near the men and ask one of them to catch up a horse for her . The lucky fellow whom she asked would ride with her .  | It was a custom of long standing ; but she was earlier than usual this Sunday morning and several of the men worked frantically to complete the jobs they were engaged upon before she should arrive within speaking distance . Two or three affected attitudes of careless idleness indicative of perfect readiness to meet any call upon their time or services . Texas Pete was cutting the hair of another puncher . He had reached a point where his victim was entirely shorn upon one side , the other displaying a crop of thick , brown hair four or five inches long , when he looked up and saw Diana approaching . Pete tossed the shears and comb into tree lap of the victim . " You-all do n't need a hair-cut nohow , " he announced , strolling away with what he believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that would , quite by accident of course , intercept Diana 's course to the corrals . The deserted and disfigured puncher wheeled upon him with a loud yell . " Come back here , you knock-kneed , bowlegged , son-of-a ? , " then his eyes , too , alighted upon Diana . His fountain of speech dried at the source , his tanned face assumed a purple cast , and in two jumps he had reached the seclusion of the bunkhouse . Hal Colby walked deliberately forward to meet the girl , a pleasant smile of greeting upon his hand-  | some face as he raised his wide sombrero in salutation . Had he been on trial for his life at that moment the entire outfit would have voted unanimously to hang him on the spot ; but , gosh , how they envied him ! Bull sat , apparently unmoved , with his back against a cottonwood tree , running a wiping rag through the barrel of a revolver . He did not even look up , though he had seen Diana Henders from the moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair in town that had caused his downfall there was no chance for him to ride with her again for many long days  --  possibly forever . " Going for a ride , Di ? " asked Colby , confidently , as the girl came abreast of the men . " Why , yes , I was thinking of it , " she replied sweetly . " I was just going to ask Bull if he would n't catch up Captain for me  --  the rest of you all seem so busy . " Colby appeared abashed but not defeated . " I have n't a thing to do , " he assured her . " But I 've made you ride with me so much lately , Hal , " she insisted . " I 'd rather ride with you than eat , " he whispered . Texas Pete had made a feeble pretense of searching for something on the ground , apparently given it up in despair , and was passing them on his way back to the bunk-house . " I do n't think you oughter ride with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl drew herself up , slightly . " Do n't be nasty , Hal , " she said . " You know I hate to say that , " he assured her . " I set a heap of store by Bull . He 's one of my best friends , but after what 's happened  --  you ca n't blame me , Di . I think your dad would say the same thing if he knew . " Bull was halfway to the corrals . " I 'll have the hosses up in a jiffy , Miss , " he called back over his shoulder . " Good-bye , Hal , " laughed the girl , teasingly . " You 'll have plenty of time to lay out the Work for tomorrow  --  a foreman 's always busy , you know , " and she walked away briskly after Bull . As Colby turned back toward the men he saw broad grins adorning the faces of most of them . Texas Pete , just approaching the bunk-house door , halted , removed his hat with a flourish , bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim ? " he inquired sweetly . " You know I 'd rather cut your hair than eat . " A loud roar of laughter acknowledged this sally . Colby , flushing crimson , beat a hasty retreat toward the office . " Which way ? " asked Bull , when the two had mounted . " I 'm going to town to see how Mack is getting along , " replied the girl , watching his face . " I seen Wildcat Bob yesterday . He said he was getting along fine . Nothing but a flesh wound . "  | Neither his voice nor his expression betrayed more than ordinary concern , " Have you seen Mack since he was shot ? " she inquired . " Ai n't had time . Colby keeps me pretty busy . Mack was a dinged fool fer gettin ' creased anyhow , " he observed . " When a feller 's got the drop on you , stick ' em up . They ai n't nothin ' else to do . Mack orter known better than to make any funny gun-play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was mighty brave of him , " said Diana . " He 's no coward  --  and he was loyal to Dad . " " I do n't see nothin ' brave about it , " he replied . " It was just plumb foolishness . Why he did n't have a chance on earth . " " That 's what made his act so courageous , " she insisted . " Then the feller what commits suicide must be a regular hero , " he rejoined , smiling . " I never looked at it that way . I reckon Mack must have been aimin ' to commit suicide . " " You 're horrid , Bull . I believe you have n't any heart at all . " " I shore have . Leastways I did have one until ? " He hesitated , looked at her in a peculiar way , then let his eyes drop to his saddle horn . " Oh , shucks ! what 's the use ? " he exclaimed . There was silence for a brief interval . The spirit of coquetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to urge him on ; but a natural kindli-  | ness coupled with the knowledge that it would be unfair to him kept her silent . It was the man who spoke again first . " I was sorry Mack got hurt , " he said , defensively ; " but he was lucky he was n't killed . That Black Coyote feller must have been a friend of his'n . " " The brute ! " she exclaimed . " He ought to be strung up to the highest tree in the county . " " Yes , " he agreed , and then , with another of his rare smiles , " let 's speak to Gum Smith about it when we get to town . " " Gum Smith ! " Were it possible to snort Gum Smith she had accomplished it . " If an honest vote had been taken for the worst man for sheriff Gum Smith would have been elected unanimously . " " Why Gum 's a good sheriff , " he teased , " ? fer tin horns and bandits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at her side . Nothing that he had said had exactly tended to weaken her faith in him , yet it had not materially strengthened it , either . His apparent callous indifference to Mack 's suffering might have been attributed with equal fairness to the bravado of the guilty desperado , or to the conditions and the times in which they lived which placed shootings and sudden death in the category of the commonplace . His suggestion that The Black Coyote must have been a friend of Mack , as an explanation of a flesh wound rather than a  | mortal one , appeared a trifle sinister , though it was amenable to other interpretations . On the whole , however , Diana Henders was not wholly pleased with the result of her probing . At The Donovan House they found Mack sufficiently recovered to be able to sit upon the veranda , where there were gathered a number of Mrs. Donovan 's other guests , including Wildcat Bob and the sheriff . Mary Donovan stood in the doorway , one hand on a hip and the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering . As Diana Renders and Bull appeared suddenly before them , the argument , which had been progressing merrily , lapsed into an embarrassed silence . It would have been evident to the most obtuse that one or the other of the newcomers had been the subject of the conversation , and neither Bull nor Diana was obtuse , the result being that they shared the embarrassment of the others . The silence , which really lasted but a brief moment , was broken by Mary Donovan 's hearty greeting to Diana , followed by a cordial word to Bull , which was seconded by Wildcat Bob . The others , however , spoke only to Diana Henders , appearing not to be aware of the presence of her escort . " Come now , " cried Mary Donovan , " into the house wid ye an ' have a bit o ' cake an ' a cup o ' tay . " But Diana Benders did not dismount . " No , thank you , Mrs. Donovan , " she replied .  | " We just rode down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was anything we could do for him . " She turned her glance toward the wounded man . " I 'm all right , Miss , " he replied . " ' T was n't nothin ' but a scratch . I 'll be back at the mine in a couple o ' days  --  an ' guardin ' the bullion shipments , too , same as usual . " He looked straight at Bull as he made this final statement . " Well , " exclaimed Diana , hastily , " I 'm glad you 're so much better , Mack , and if there is n't anything we can do for you we 'll start back for the ranch . " She sensed the sullen attitude of most of the men there , the scowls they cast at Bull , and she knew that it would require little to precipitate a direct accusation , which would have been almost certain to have been followed by gunplay . " Come , Bull , " she said , and reined her pony about . They had ridden well out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It bore a troubled expression and he must have guessed that she noted it . " I wonder what was eatin ' them fellers , " he remarked . " No one only Wildcat Bob even spoke to me , an ' Mack seemed gosh-almighty sore about somethin ' . Well , they ai n't none of ' em got their brand on me . If I did shoot up Gum Smith 's joint it ai n't no hair offen none of them . " The girl wondered if he really was ignorant of the suspicions directed against him , or if he took  | this means to make her believe that the cause of the altered attitude toward him was his drunken gunplay in the sheriff 's saloon . " I was right sorry about that , Miss , " he blurted suddenly . " I never aimed for to do it . I was n't goin ' to drink too much no more after what I 'd promised you . I 'm right sorry . Do you think that , maybe , you  --  you might forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleading and he was very much in earnest . The girl knew how difficult it was for a rough man like Bull to say what he had just said and she felt a sudden compassion for him . " It made me sorry , too , Bull , " she said . " I trusted you and I hated to be so disappointed in you. , , " Please do n't say you do n't trust me , Miss , " he begged . " I want you to trust me , more'n anything else . " " I want to trust you , Bull , " and then , impulsively : " I do trust you ! " He reached across the interval between them and laid his rough hand upon her soft one . " I love you , Diana , " he said , very simply and with a quiet dignity that was unmarred by any hesitancy or embarrassment . She started to speak , but he silenced her with a gesture . " Do n't say anything about it , please , " he urged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's nothing  | wrong about my loving you . I just wanted you to know it so that you 'd always know where I stood and that you could always call on me for anything . With yer dad an ' all the other men around that loves you there is n't much likelihood that you 'll ever need me more'n another , but it makes me feel better to know that you know now . We wo n't talk about it no more , Miss . We both understand . It 's the reason I did n't quit when yer dad busted me . " " I 'm glad you told me , Bull , " she said . " It 's the greatest honor that any man can bestow upon a girl . I do n't love any man , Bull , that way ; but if ever I do he 'll know it without my telling him . I 'll do something that will prove it ? a girl always does . Sometimes , though , the men are awfully blind , they say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd know it , I think , if a girl loved me . " " The right one will , some day , " she assured him . He shook his head . " I hope so , Miss . " She flushed , sensing the unintentional double entendre he had caught in her words . She wondered why she flushed . They rode on in silence . She was sorry that Bull loved her , but she was glad that , loving her , he had told her of his love . He was just a common cowhand , unlettered , rough , and occasionally uncouth , but of these things she did not think , for she had known no other sort , except her father and an occasional visitor from the East , since childhood . Had  | she cared for him she would not have been ashamed She looked up at him with a smile . " Do n't call me Miss , ' Bull , please ? I hate it . " " You want me to call you by your first name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " and you did ? a moment ago . " " It slipped out that time . " He grinned sheepishly . " I like it . " " All right , Miss , " he said . The girl laughed aloud , joyously . " All right , Diana , I mean , " he corrected himself . " That 's better . " So Diana Henders , who was really a very sensible girl , instead of merely playing with fire , made a big one of a little one , all very unintentionally , for how was she to know that to Bull the calling of her Diana instead of Miss was almost as provocative to his love as would have been the personal contact of a kiss to an ordinary man ? As they approached the ranch house at the end of their ride they saw a buckboard to which two bronchos were harnessed hitched to the tie rail beneath the cottonwoods outside the office door . " Whose outfit is that ? " asked Diana . " I never saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' the hills . I seen ' em in town about a week ago . " " Oh , yes , I 've heard of them . They 're from the  | East . Mr. Wainright do n't like the country north of the mountains . " " He 's lookin ' fer range on this side , " said Bull . " Like as not that 's what he 's here fer now . They ai n't enough water fer no more outfits though , nor enough feed neither . " They drew rein at the corral and dismounted . " Thanks , Bull , " said the girl , as she passed him her bridle reins . " We 've had a lovely ride . " " Thanks ? Diana . " That was all he said , but the way he spoke her name was different from the way any other man had ever spoken it . She was sorry now that she had asked him to call her Diana . As she was passing the office to go to her room her father called to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet some new neighbors , " and when she had entered , " My daughter , Mr. Wainright . " Diana extended her hand to a fat man with closeset eyes , and then her father presented the younger Wainright . " Mr. Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , Diana , " he said . The sort was a well-groomed appearing , nicelooking young fellow of twenty-one or twenty-two . Perhaps his costume was a trifle too exaggerated to be in good taste , but he had only fallen into the name mistake that many another wealthy young Easterner has done before and since upon his advent to the cow-country . From silver banded sombrero  | to silver encrusted spurs there was no detail lacking . " By gollies , he looks like a Christmas tree , " had been Texas Pete 's observation the first time that he had seen him . " All they forgot was the candles . " " You live north of the mountains ? " inquired Diana , politely . " Yep , " replied the elder Wainright ; " but we do n't calc'late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  blankets  --  made a fortune in ' em  --  made ' em for the gover'ment mostly . Jeff got it in his head he wanted to go into the cattle business  --  come by it natch'ral I allow . I used to be in the livery stable business before I bought the mills ? so when he graduates from Harvard a year ago we come out here  --  do n't like it tother side the mountains  --  so I calc'lates to come over here . " " I was just explaining to Mr. Wainright that there is scarcely enough feed or water for another big outfit on this side , " interjected Mr. Henders . " Do n't make any difference  --  set your price ? but set it right . I 'll buy you out . I c 'd buy half this territory I calc'late  --  if I had a mind to  --  but the price 's got to be right . 01 ' Jeff Wainright 's got a name for bein ' a pretty shrewd trader ? fair'n honest , though ? fair'n honest . Just name your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , land , cattle  --  everything ? " Elias Henders laughed good naturedly . " I 'm afraid they 're not for sale , Mr. Wainright . " " Tut , tut ! I 'll get ' em  --  you 'll sell  --  ol ' Jeff  | Wainright 's always got everything he went after . Well , son , I calc'late we 'd better be goin ' . " " You 'll have dinner with us first , of course , " insisted Diana ; " it must be almost ready now . " " Well , I do n't mind if we do , " returned the elder Wainright , and so they stayed for the noon day meal . Diana found the younger Wainright a pleasant , affable companion . He was the first educated man near her own age that she had ever met and his conversation and his ways , so different from those of the rough vaqueros of her little world , made a profound impression upon her . He could talk interestingly from the standpoint of personal experience of countless things of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those first two hours with him thrilled her with excitement  --  they opened a new world of wondrous realities that she had hitherto thought of more as unattainable dreams than things which she herself might some day experience . If he had inherited something of his father 's egotism she forgot it in the contemplation of his finer qualities and in the pleasure she derived from association with one somewhere near her own social status in life . That the elder Wainright was Impossible she had sensed from the first , but the son seemed of different fiber and no matter what his antecedents , he must have acquired something of permanent polish through his college associations .  | The disquieting effect of the Wainrights ' visit was apparent elsewhere than at the ranch house . There was gloom at the bunk-house . " Dog-gone his hide ! " exclaimed Texas Pete . " Whose ? " inquired Shorty . " My of man 's . If he had n't gone an ' got hung he might ' a ' sent me to Havaad . What chance has a feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ! "  | CHAPTER V THE ROUND-UP " HAD a letter from Wainright in the mail today , Di , " said Elias Henders to his daughter about a week later . " He is after me again to put a price on the whole shebang . ' " " We could go East and live then , could n't we ? " asked the girl . Henders looked at her keenly . There had been just the tiniest trace of wistfulness in her tone . He crossed the room and put an arm about her . " You 'd like to go East and live ? " he asked . " I love it here , Dad ; but there is so much there that we can never have here . I should like to see how other people live . I should like to go to a big hotel , and to the theaters and opera , and meet educated people of my own age . I should like to go to parties where no one got drunk and shot the lights out , " she concluded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to go back , " he told her . " I am afraid I have been selfish . Because I never wanted to go back after your mamma left us , I forgot that you had a right to the same advantages that she and I enjoyed . The ranch seemed enough ? the ranch and you . "  | " But there 'd be no one to manage things if you went away , " she insisted . " Oh , that could be arranged . I thought you felt that we could n't afford to go unless we sold . " " It would be nice if you were relieved of all responsibility , " said . If you sold the ranch and the brand you would n't have to worry about how things were going here . " " Old Wainright would n't pay what they are worth , even if I was ready to sell , " he explained . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do ? 1 ' 11 make him a price . If he takes it I 'll sell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go East to stay , if you like it . " " What price are you going to ask ? " " Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the ranch and the brand . They might bring more if I wanted to make an effort to get more , but that will show a fair profit for us and I know will be satisfactory to John . He has asked me a dozen times in his letters why I did n't sell the cattle end of the business and come East . " " Yes , I know Uncle John has always wanted us to come back , " she said . " But old Wainright really does n't want the ranch and cattle at all , " said her father . " What he wants is the mine . He has offered me a million dollars for all our holdings in the county , including the mine . He mentions the fact that the workings have pretty nearly petered out , and he 's right , and he thinks I 'll grab at it to unload . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the past six months  --  the new bookkeeper that Corson sent out while your Uncle John Manill was in Europe ? and he thinks he 's discovered something that I do n't know  --  but I do . For years , Di , we 've been paralleling a much richer vein than the one we 've been working . I 've known it for the past two years , but John and I figured we 'd work out the old one first ? we 've all the money we need anyway . The mine alone is worth ten or twenty millions . " " Uncle John knows it ? There would n't be any danger that someone might trick him into a deal ? " " Not a chance , and of course , as you know , he would n't do anything without consulting me . Ours is rather a peculiar partnership , Di , but it 's a very safe one for both of us . There is n't the scratch of a pen between us as far as any written agreement is concerned , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us married the only precautions we took to safeguard our interests was to make our wills ? I left everything to him and he left everything to me . After we married we made new wills , that was all . " If I die first everything goes to him , and when he dies it is all divided equally between our surviving heirs ; or just the other way around if he dies first . Each of us felt that we could thus best safeguard the interests of our respective families , since we both had implicit confidence in the other 's honesty and integrity . "  | " Oh , let 's not talk about it , " exclaimed the girl . " Neither one of you is ever going to die . " " All right , Di , " laughed her father ; " just as you say  --  you 've always had your own way . Now we 'll plan that Eastern trip . Ca n't very well go until after the spring round-up , and in the meantime we can be sizing up Colby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better than to leave him in charge . I never did like the idea of importing a new man as superintendent if you could possibly use one of your own men . What do you think of him , Di ? " " I do n't know yet Dad , " she replied . " I like him immensely , and I think he 's honest and loyal , but he do n't know stock , nor the range , as well as Bull . " " Bull is out of the question , " replied her father . " I could never trust him again . " " I know how you feel . I feel the same way , and yet there is something about him , Dad ? I ca n't explain it ; but when I am with him I can not doubt him . " " He 's got you hypnotized . I hope he has n't been making love to you , " he concluded , seriously . " Oh , they all do , " she cried , laughing ; " but Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be marrying one of these days , and if you were going to live here I 'd rather you married a Western boy ; but if you are going East you must n't fall in love yet , for you  | are sure to find a great difference between the boys you have known and the boys back there . " " Do n't worry , Dad , I have n't fallen in love yet ; but if I do soon I 'm afraid it 's going to be either Hal Colby or Jefferson Wainright . " " Senior ? " he asked . " Oh , is n't he funny  --  and impossible ! " she cried . " He 's all of that and more too , " replied her father . " What do you mean ? " " I mean that I would n't trust him as far as I could throw a bull by the tail . He 's one of those blue-bellied Yankees who considers any means as honest that keep him on the right side of a jail door ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is delightful and wonderful , " said Diana . The days passed , lovely , sunshiny days during which Diana spent long hours dreaming of the coming Eastern trip . She rode much , as usual , sometimes with one man , again with another , but more often with her father or Hal Colby . Bull 's assignments usually took him too far afield for her to accompany him . If he thought that Colby had some such purpose in mind when he laid out the work from day to day he said nothing of it ; but he could not have failed to notice that following each of the few occasions upon which Diana accompanied him , usually a Sunday , he was given  | work the next day that kept him in the saddle until late at night , and upon several occasions away from the ranch for two days or more . At last the time of the spring rodeo arrived . Riders from other outfits commenced straggling in , some from a hundred miles away , until the Bar Y Ranch commenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuck wagon was overhauled and outfitted . The cavvy was brought over from West Ranch  --  wild , half-broken horses , with a sprinkling of colts that had never felt leather ? and assigned to the riders . There were enough to give each man a string of eight horses . With the others came Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , arrayed like Solomon . At first the men had a lot of fun with him , but when he took it good-naturedly they let up a bit , and after a few evenings , during which he sang and told stories , they accepted him almost as one of them . He was much with Diana Henders , with the result that he found himself with four unbroken bronchs in his string . The Bar Y hands grinned when Colby picked them for him , and everyone was present when he first essayed to ride one of them . Diana was there too . She chanced to be standing near Bull when the first of the four , having been roped , thrown and hogtied , was finally saddled , bridled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roman-nosed pinto and its back was humped like a camel's.  | " He shore looks mean , " remarked Bull to the girl . " They ought not to let Mr. Wainright ride him , " she replied . " He 's not used to bad horses and he may be killed . " " I reckon that 's just about how Hal figgered it , " said Bull . " I did n't think it of him . It 's a shame ! " she exclaimed . " Some one ought to top that horse for Mr. Wainright ? some one who can ride  --  like you , Bull , " she added flatteringly . " You want me to ? " he asked . " I do n't want to see the poor man killed . " Bull stepped forward and climbed into the corral . Wainright was standing several feet from the pinto watching several men who were trying to readjust the blind over the brute 's eyes . Bull saw that the man was afraid . " Want me to top him for you , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's safe ? " asked Wainright . " Oh , yes , he 's safe  --  like a Kansas cyclone . " Wainright grinned a sickly grin . " I 'd appreciate it , " he said , " if you 'd try him first . I 'd be glad to pay you for your trouble . " Bull approached the men with the horse . " Lead him out , " he said . " When I rides one like that I wants elbow room . " They ran the pony , bucking , out of the corral . Bull stepped to the animal 's side .  | " What you do in ' ? " demanded Colby , who had been standing too far away to overhear the conversation . " Toppin ' this one for the dude , " replied Bull . " No you 're not , " snapped Colby . His voice was angry . " You 'll ride the hosses I tells you to and so will he . " " I 'm ridin ' this one , " replied Bull . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right was on the horn of the saddle . Carefully he placed his left foot in the stirrup . Then he nodded to a man standing at the horse 's head . The blind was snatched away and the man leaped aside . The horse reared , wheeled and struck at Bull , but Bull was not there  --  he was in the saddle . The animal lunged forward awkwardly once , then he gathered himself , stuck his nose between his front feet and went to pitching , scientifically and in earnest , and as he pitched he lunged first to the right and then to the left , twisting his body , squealing and kicking . Bull waved his sombrero and slapped the beast on neck and rump with it and the pinto bucked the harder . Finding that these tactics failed to unseat the rider he commenced suddenly to turn end for end in air at each jump , yet still the man stuck , until the beast , frantic with combined terror and rage , stopped in his tracks and turned savagely to bite at Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the sting of the quirt and then he reared quickly and  | threw himself over backward in an effort to crush his rider , nor did he miss him by a matter of more than inches . There are those who will tell you just how you should throw yourself safely to one side when a horse falls , but any man who has had a horse fall with him , or deliberately throw himself backward , knows that it is five parts chance and the rest luck if he is n't caught , and so it was just luck that Bull fell clear . Diana Henders felt a sudden lump in her throat and then she saw the horse scramble to his feet and the rider too , just in time to throw a leg across the saddle , and come up with a firm seat and both feet in the stirrups . The quirt fell sharply first on one flank and . then on the other , the pinto took a dozen running jumps and then settled down to a smooth run across the open . Five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trembling and frightened , but with the hump out of his back . " You kin ride him now , " said Bull to young Wainright , as he dismounted carefully and stood stroking the animal 's neck . Hal Colby came forward angrily , but Bull had dismounted close to where Diana Henders stood , and it was she who spoke to him first , and Colby , approaching , heard her words . " Thank you , ever so much , Bull , " she said . " I was sorry afterwards that I asked you to ride him ,  | for I thought you were going to be hurt when he threw himself  --  I should never have forgiven myself . " " Shucks ! " said Bull . " It was n't nothin ' . " Colby walked off in another direction . If there had been bad blood between the two men in the past it had never been given outward expression , but from that moment Colby made little or no effort to hide the fact that he had no use for Bull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the foreman . Better friendships than had ever existed between these two have been shattered because of a woman , but there were other exciting causes here . That Colby had gotten Bull 's job might have been enough to cause a break , while the foreman 's evident suspicion that Bull knew a great deal too much about the holdups in Hell 's Bend and the shooting of Mack Harber would have turned even more generous natures than Hal Colby 's against the exforeman . In spite of herself Diana Henders could not deny a feeling of chagrin that Jefferson Wainright had permitted another man to top a bad horse for him , although it had been she who had arranged it . Perhaps she was a trifle cool to the young Easterner that evening , but she thawed gradually beneath the geniality of his affable ways and entertaining conversation , and in the weeks that followed , during which she accompanied the outfit throughout the  | round-up , she was with him much of the time , to the great discomfiture of Hal Colby and others . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bull rode the pinto for Wainright , left the latter severely alone , for the following morning Elias Henders had come to the corral and selected a new string of horses for the " dude " and spoken a few words into the ear of his foreman . The long , hard days in the saddle left them all ready to turn in to their blankets soon after supper . A smoke , a little gossip and rough banter and the men jingled away through the darkness in search of their bed-rolls to the accompaniment of their tinkling spurs . " I seen Injun signs today , " remarked a tall , thin Texan one evening . " ' Bout a dozen of ' em been campin ' over yender a piece in them hills . Signs war n't over four hour old . " " They mought be peaceable Injuns on pass from the reservation , " suggested another . " More likely they 're renegades , " said Shorty . " Anyhow I ai n't a-takin ' no chances on no Injuns ? I shoots fust an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't never seed a hos-tyle Injun , Shorty , " said Texas Pete . " A lot you know about it , you sawed-off , hammered-down , squint-eyed horse thief , " retorted Shorty courteously ; " I 'm a bad man with Injuns . " " By gollies ! " exclaimed Pete , " thet reminds me of another verse :  | " So bring on yore bad men , yore killers an ' sich An ' send out some Greasers to dig me a ditch , Fer when I gits through , of I takes any pains , You 'll need a big hole fer to plant the remains . ' " On the opposite side of the chuck wagon , where a tent had been pitched for Diana Henders , a little group surrounded her fire . Beside the girl there were her father , Hal Colby and Jefferson Wainright , Jr . The two young men always gravitated in Diana 's direction when off duty . Colby had been quick to realize the advantage that the other 's education gave him and bright enough to remain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the Easterner in vast contempt , yet he cultivated him and often rode with him that he might learn from him something of those refinements which he guessed constituted the basis of Diana 's evident liking for Wainright . He asked him many questions , got him to talk about books . and made mental note of various titles with the determination to procure and read the books that he had heard the man discuss with Diana . Bull , on his part , kept away from the Henders ' fire in the evening and in the day time Colby saw to it that his assignments sent him far afield from where there was much likelihood of Diana being , with the result that he saw less of her than was usual at home . The ex-foreman 's natural reserve had degenerated almost to sullenness . He spoke seldom and never  | smiled , but he rode hard and did his work well , until he came to be acknowledged as the best all-round man in the outfit . There was no horse that he would n't ride , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ever refuse , no matter how unfair the assignment , with the result that the men respected him though there was none who seemed to like his company , with the exception of Texas Pete . " Well , boys , " said Elias Henders , rising , " I guess we 'd better be turning in . Tomorrow 's going to be a hard day . " The two younger men rose , Colby stretching and yawning . " I reckon you 're right , Mr. Henders , " he agreed , but waiting for Wainright to make the first move to leave . The latter paused to roll a cigarette  --  an accomplishment that he had only recently brought to a state even approximating perfection . He used both hands and was rather slow .. Colby eyed him , guessing that he was merely fighting for time in order to force the foreman to go first . Slowly the latter withdrew his own pouch of tobacco from his shirt pocket . " Reckon I 'll roll a smoke by the light of your fire , Di , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , poured in a little tobacco , and , as he drew the pouch closed with his teeth and left hand , deftly rolled the cigarette with his right , bending it slightly in the center to keep it from opening up . Wainright realized that if he had a  | conversational advantage over Colby there were other activities in which the foreman greatly outshone him . Rolling a smoke was one of them and that was doubtless why Colby had chosen to roll one at a moment that odious comparison might be made . Wainright lighted his and shifted to the other foot . Would Colby never leave ! Colby permitted three matches to burn out before he finally succeeded in getting a light , thus gaining a considerable advantage in time over Wainright . Elias Henders had repaired to his blankets , just beyond Diana 's tent and out of sight . The girl realized the game that the two men were playing and could scarce repress an inclination to laughter . She wondered which would win , or if she would have to call it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided the matter . " Come on , Colby , " he said , throwing an arm about the other 's shoulders , " we 're keeping Miss Henders up . Good night , Miss Henders , " and raising his hat he moved off , taking Colby with him . They had taken about twenty steps when Wainright halted and wheeled about . " Oh , I say , Miss Henders , " he called , " there 's something I wanted to ask you , " and he started back . " Do n't wait for me , Colby , " he threw over his shoulder ; " I 'll be along in a moment . " Colby glared at the other 's retreating back  | through the darkness , hurled his cigarette to the ground and stamped away , out generaled . " I 'll get him yet , " he mumbled . " He may be pretty slick at them parlor tricks , but they ai n't many parlors in Arizona . The damn dude ! " Wainright rejoined Diana by the fire . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " and I have n't had half a chance to talk with you . Colby hangs around as though he had a mortgage on your time and was going to foreclose . He sort of puts a damper on conversation unless it revolves about cows  --  that 's all he can talk about . " " It 's a subject that is always of interest to us out here , " replied the girl loyally . " Cows are really our lives , you know . " " Oh , that 's all right for men ; but there are other things in life for a girl like you , Miss Henders . You deserve something better than cows ? and cowboys . You love music and books , and you ca n't deny that you like to talk about them . You belong East  --  you belong back in Boston . " " We 're going back , not to Boston , but to New York , after the round-up  --  Dad and I , " she told him . " No ! really ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go together . " " That would be fine , " she agreed . " Would n't you like to stay back there ? " he asked , almost excitedly , and then quite unexpectedly he took her hand . " Miss Henders ! " he exclaimed .  | " Diana ! Would n't you like to stay there always ? I 'd make a home for you there  --  I 'd make you happy  --  I love you , Diana . We could be married before we left . Would n't it be wonderful , going back there together on our honeymoon ! And then to Europe ! We could travel everywhere . Money would mean nothing . I do n't have to tell you how rich we are . " " No , " she replied , " I have heard your father mention it , " and withdrew her hand from his . He did not seem to notice the allusion to his father 's boastfulness . " Tell me that you love me , " he insisted . " Tell me that you will marry me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , " she replied . " Why , I scarcely know you , and you certainly do n't know me well enough to know that you would want to live with me all the rest of your life . " " Oh , yes , I do ! " he exclaimed . " If there was only some way to prove it . Words are so futile ? they can not express my love , Diana . Why , I worship you . There is no sacrifice that I would not willingly and gladly make for you or yours . I would die for you , dear girl , and thank God for the chance ! " " But I do n't want you to die for me . I want you to go to bed and give me a chance to think . I have never been in love . Possibly I love you and do not know it . There is no need for haste anyway .  | I will give you my answer before I go East . Now run along , like a good boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may hope , " he begged . " You will do that anyway , if you love me , " she told him , laughingly , as she turned and entered her tent . " Good night ! "  | CHAPTER VI THE RENEGADES THE next morning Colby took Wainright with him . Deep in the foreman 's heart was a determination to ride hard over the roughest country he could find and if the " dude " got killed it would n't be Colby 's fault  --  nor would it be Colby 's fault if he did n't . But the foreman 's plans were upset at the last moment by Elias Henders and Diana , who elected to accompany him . " You and Wainright ride ahead , Hal , " directed Henders , " and Di and I will trail along behind . " The foreman nodded silently and put spurs to his pony , and in silence Wainright loped at his side . The arrangement suited neither and each was busy concocting schemes whereby the other might be paired off with Elias Henders , though under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of spending a whole day in company with " the old man . " " Glorious morning ! " ejaculated Henders to his daughter . " God may have forgotten Arizona in some respects , but he certainly remembered to give her the most wonderful mornings in the world . " " Do n't they fill one with the most exquisite sensations ! " she exclaimed .  | " Almost as intoxicating as wine , " he agreed , and then : " By the way , Bull 's been doing fine , has n't he ? I do n't believe he 's touched a drop since that night at Gum 's . " " He 's working hard , too , " said the girl . " He always did that  --  he 's the best cow-hand I ever saw and a hog for work . There is n't a man in seven counties that can commence to touch him when it comes to riding , roping , parting , calling brands , judging ages or weights , or handling cattle with judgment under any conditions , nor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Why , day before yesterday he had to give a fellow from the Red Butte country some pointers about the fellow 's own range  --  Bull knew it better than he did . " " He 's wonderful , " said Diana . " I love to see him in the saddle , and anywhere in the cow-country he fits into the picture . I 'm always proud that Bull is one of our men . Oh , I hope he do n't ever drink again . " Elias Henders shook his head . " I 'm afraid he 'll never quit , " he said . " A man 's got to have something to quit for , and Bull has no incentive to stop ? only just his job , and when did a little thing like a job keep a man from drinking , especially the best cow-hand in the territory ? There is n't an outfit anywhere that would n't hire him , drunk or sober . He do n't seem to be hanging around you much lately , Di , and I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in a man like Bull . I do n't take much to garrulous people , but neither do I want ' em as tightmouthed as Bull . I 'm afraid he 's got something to hide that makes him afraid to talk for fear he 'll let it out . " " What do you suppose happened last nights , Dad ? " asked Diana , suddenly . " I do n't know , I 'm sure  --  what ? " he asked . " Jefferson Wainright proposed to me . " " No ! What did you tell him ? " " What should I have told him ? " " That depends upon how much or little you think of him , " replied her father . " Would you like him for a son-in-law ? " " If you choose him , I shall like him  --  I should like the Devil if you chose to marry him . " " Well , he is n't quite as bad as all that , is he ? " she cried , laughing . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He could give you everything and he could take you among the sort of people that you belong among , and you would n't have to be ashamed of him ; but I do n't like his father . " " His father is something of an embarrassment , " she assented . " Do you love the boy , Di ? " he asked . " I do n't know , and I told him so . He wants me to marry him before we go East , and all go together . " " What a lovely idea  --  taking your fathers on  | a honeymoon ! You can count me out , and anyway if some other man is going to take you East I wo n't have to go at all . " " Well , I have n't gone with him , yet . I told him I 'd give him his answer before we left . " " That would be a good idea  --  if he is going ? he might want a few minutes ' notice , " he bantered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little in that direction . " " I do , " laughed the girl . " When I m with one I like that one best , and when I 'm with the other I like him . " " And when they are both with you at the same time  --  possibly you can find your answer there . " " I have thought of that , because then I always compare the two  --  and Hal always suffers by the comparison . That is when we are sitting talking ? but when they are in the saddle it is the other way round . " " People ca n't spend their married lives in the saddle , " he reminded her . She sighed . " I am terribly perplexed . Of only one thing am I sure and that is that I shall marry either Hal Colby or Jefferson Wainright . " " Or some one else , " he suggested . " No ! no one else , " she stated emphatically . It was past noon and they had turned back , gathering up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canyon and coulee onto the flat below . Elias Henders and Diana were riding  | quite apart from the foreman and Wainright when Henders turned back to ride to the summit of a low elevation for a final survey of the country for any straggling bunch that might have escaped their notice . Diana was a few yards in rear of him as he drew rein on top of the hillock . It was very quiet . The cattle were at a distance from them , moving slowly off down the valley . There was only the sound of her horse 's unshod hoofs in the soft dirt and the subdued noise of a well-worn saddle as she urged her mount toward the side of her father . Suddenly there was the crack of a rifle and Elias Henders ' horse dropped in its tracks . Henders fell clear and whipped out his revolver . " Get out of here , Di ! " he called to the girl . " It 's Indians . You 've got time if you keep behind this butte and ride like Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a mile away  --  Colby and Wainright . She saw them wheel their horses and look toward the point from which the shot had come and from their position she guessed that they could see the Indians , though she could not . Then she saw Hal Colby put spurs and quirt to his mount until the wiry beast fairly flew over the ground toward her . Wainright hesitated , looked toward the Indians and then back down the valley in the direction of the camp fifteen miles away . Suddenly he wheeled his horse and dashed off .  | To her mind flashed the impassioned words that he had poured into her ears only the night before : " I worship you . There is no sacrifice that I would not willingly and gladly make for you or yours . I would die for you , dear girl , and thank God for the chance ! " Her lip curled and her eyes shot a single scornful glance in the direction of the retreating figure of Jefferson Wainright before she turned them back toward Colby . How magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was riding , not for the hill , but straight for the Indians , and just as he passed out of her sight behind the hillock he opened fire . She could hear the crack of his gun mingling with those of the Indians , and then her father , pausing in his fire , turned to her again . " My God , Di , have n't you gone ? " he cried . " Hurry ! There is time yet . Hal has got ' em on the run now , but they 'll be back again . There must be a dozen of them . Ride back to camp for help . " " Mr. Wainright has already gone , Dad , " she told him . " We have always been together , all my life , Dad , and it do n't take two to get help . We need all the guns here we can get until the boys come , " and she dismounted and crawled to his side , despite his protests . Over the crest of the hill she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a mile beyond him , were just circling back in pursuit . In the foreground a dead Indian lay  | sprawled in the open . To the right a riderless pony was loping away to join its fellows . Diana lay a few feet from her father , both in readiness to cover Colby 's retreat when the Indians came within revolver range . " Wish we had a couple of rifles , " remarked Elias Henders . " If I had a thirty-thirty I could hold ' em off alone until the boys get here . " " We ought to be able to . hold out for an hour , Dad . The boys should be here in that time . " " We 'll do the best we can , but , Di ? " he paused , a little catch in his voice ? " do n't let them get you , dear . The boys might not get here in time . " Wainright is not much of a rider  --  he wo n't make the time that one of our boys would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . And then there may not be anyone in camp but the cook that time of day  --  that 's what I 'm really most afraid of . " We 'll do the best we can . Likely as not we 'll pull through ; but if we do n't , why , remember what I said , do n't let ' em get you  --  save one shot . You understand ? " " I understand , Dad . " Colby , his horse stretched to quirt and spur , swung around to their side of the hill , threw his horse to its haunches as he reined in close to them and leaped from the saddle . Without a word he dragged the blowing , half-winded animal directly in front of them , raised his six-shooter to its forehead and shot it between the eyes .  | Diana Henders voiced a little gasp of dismay , and then she saw the man turn toward her own pony ; but she only covered her eyes with her palms and bit her lip to stifle a sob . A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling body . " Crawl behind that cayuse of mine , Di , " said Colby . He was tugging at the body of the girl 's pony to drag it closer to the others , in order to form a rude triangle with the two other dead horses . Henders rose to his knees and gave Colby a hand , while Di opened fire upon the approaching braves . " Reckon we orter hold out here till the boys come , " remarked the foreman . He was cool and self-possessed  --  just as cool and self-possessed as Jefferson Wainright would have been in a Boston drawing-room . Even as she took careful aim at a half-naked , yelling buck , and missed him , Diana Henders ' mind was considering this fact . She fired again and this time the buck ceased to yell , grasped his stomach with both hands and toppled headlong to the ground . Hal Colby might learn to be cool and self-possessed in a Boston drawing-room , but could Jefferson Wainright ever learn to be cool and self-possessed inside a yelling circle of painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now riding a wide circle entirely about the hillock , firing as they rode . Naturally their aim was execrable , and the three were in danger only of a chance hit . After the warrior  | fell to Diana 's bullet the circle widened to still greater proportions and a few minutes later the Indians withdrew out of effective revolver range and gathered in a compact group where the three on the hillock could see them gesticulating and talking excitedly . " They 're up to some new devilment , " said Henders . " I hope they do n't charge from different directions before the boys git here , " remarked Colby . " If they do we might as well kiss ourselves goodbye . I wish you was n't here , Di . " Damn that white-livered dude 's hide . Ef he had n't turned tail you could have gone . You could ride rings around that slab-sided maverick , an ' besides you 'd have been safe . Look ! They 're separatin ' now . " " Yes , they 're riding to surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , Hal , " said Henders , " wait until they get close and then stand up and let them have it . Di , you lie as close to the ground as you can . Do n't move . Just watch us , and when you see we 're both down you 'll know it 's all up and  --  you must do what I told you to . " Hal Colby looked at the beautiful girl at his side , and scowled , for he guessed without being told , what her father meant . " Damn that dude ! " he muttered . " Mebby I had n't orter shot all the hosses , " he  | said presently . " Mebby Di could have got away . " " No , " Henders assured him . " You did just right , Hal . Di would n't go . I told her to , but she would n't . It was too late then anyway . " " I figgered it was too late , " said Colby ; " but mebby it was n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're coming ! " cried Diana . From four sides the Indians were racing toward them , their savage cries breaking hideously the silence of the sun-parched valley . The three crouched , waiting . No word was spoken until the nearest of the red-skins was no more than twentyfive yards away . Then : " Now ! " said Henders , leaping to his feet . Colby was up simultaneously , firing as he rose . Diana Henders , far from lying close to the ground as she had been directed , was on her feet almost as quickly as the men . " Get down , Di ! " commanded her father , but her only reply was a shot that brought down a warrior 's pony twenty paces from them . Colby and Henders had each shot an Indian and there was another pony down in front of Colby . The renegades were close now and presented splendid targets for the three whites , all of whom were excellent revolver shots . At each report of their weapons a hit was scored . Now a pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight down the gentle declivity  | of the hillside ; another stumbled and crumpled to the ground , sprawling its painted master in the dust ; a warrior , wounded , veered to one side and raced off to safety ; or , again , one slumped silently to earth , never to charge again . Two of the unhorsed warriors sprang into close quarters , clubbing their empty rifles . One was leaping toward Diana , the other for Colby . At the same instant Elias Henders lifted both hands above his head , his gun slipped from nerveless fingers , and he lunged forward across the body of his dead horse . Colby put a shot through the stomach of the buck leaping upon him , then turned toward Diana . He saw the painted face of a tall chief just beyond Diana 's ; he saw the rifle swinging to brain her as she pulled the trigger of her Colt with the muzzle almost against the sweat streaked body ; there was no answering report , and then Colby , leaping between them , seized the upraised rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two clinched , the Indian reaching for his knife , while the white , who had emptied both guns and had no time to reload , strove to brain his antagonist with one of them . Struggling , they fell . Diana Henders , reloading her own weapon , looked hurriedly about . The other warriors , momentarily dispersed , had rallied and were returning with wild , triumphant yells , for they saw that the battle was already theirs .  | Elias Henders raised himself weakly on one elbow and looked about . Instantly his gaze took in the situation . " Di ! " he cried , " my little girl . Quick ! Do n't wait ! Shoot yourself before they get you . " " Not yet ! " she cried , and turned toward the two men , the red and the white , battling at her feet . Stooping , she held the muzzle of her weapon close to the rolling , tossing men , waiting an opportunity to put a bullet in the chief when she could do so without endangering Colby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the racing hoofs of their ponies pounding a dull tattoo on the powdery earth . They were almost upon her when Colby 's fingers found the chief 's throat and the latter 's head was pushed momentarily away from that of the white man . It was the instant that Diana had awaited . She stepped in closer , there was the sound of a shot , and the renegade collapsed limply in Colby 's grasp . Simultaneously a wild yell arose from below them in the valley . The remaining Indians , almost upon them , were riding in a dose mass from the opposite side . What could it be  --  more Indians ? Colby had hurled the dead chief aside and was on his feet beside the girl . They both looked in the direction of the new sound to see two horsemen racing madly toward them . " It 's Bull ! It 's Bull ! " cried Diana Henders . " Bull and Texas Pete . "  | The ponies of the oncoming men were racing neck and neck . The riders were howling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wheeled to one side  --  there were five of them left . The reinforcements were too much for them , and with a parting volley they galloped off . But Bull and Texas Pete were of no mind to let them go so easily . For a mile or more they pursued them , until they realized that their already almost spent horses could not outdistance the mounts of the Indians . Then they turned and loped slowly back toward the three upon the hillock . Instantly the immediate necessity of defense had passed Diana Henders kneeled beside her father and lifted his head in her arms . Colby stepped to the opposite side of the prostrate man to help her . Suddenly she looked up into his eyes , an expression of horror in her 's . " Oh , Hal ! Hal ! he 's gone ! " she cried , and burying her face in her arms , burst into tears . The man , unaccustomed to a woman 's tears , or a sorrow such as this , was at a loss for words , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to him , so that she stood with her face buried in the hollow of his shoulder as Bull and Texas Pete rode up the hill and dismounted beside them . They took in the pitiful scene at a glance , but they saw more in it than the death of " the old man , " whom they both loved  --  at least Bull did .  | In the attitude of Diana and Colby he read the death knell of whatever faint hope he might have entertained of ultimate happiness . It was a hurt and bitter man that lifted the dead body of his employer in strong arms and laid it across the saddle of his horse . " You ride Pete 's hoss , Miss , " he said gently . " Colby , you walk ahead with her . Pete an ' I 'll come along with the old man . " They all did as he bid without question . There was something about the man that demanded obedience even if he was no longer foreman . It was always that way with Bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men mistrusted , or disliked him , and many did , they involuntarily obeyed him . Possibly because he was a strong man who thought quickly and accurately and was almost invariably right in his decision  --  it was certainly not because a large proportion of them loved him , for they did not . There was that something lacking in Bull ? that quality which attracted the love of his fellows . After Diana and Colby had gone ahead Bull and Pete roped the body of Elias Henders securely to the saddle and presently the sorrowful little cortege took its slow way back toward camp .  | CHAPTER VII EXIT WAINRIGHT A WEEK or ten days after Elias Henders ' funeral the Wainright buck-board drew into the Bar Y ranch yard and the Wainrights , senior and junior , alighted and approached the house . They found Diana in the office working on the books , which she had kept for her father when they were without a bookkeeper , which was the case at present . She greeted them politely , but without marked cordiality . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's death , having refused to see the younger man on her return to the camp with Elias Henders ' body . " We been calc'latin ' to drive over for several days past , Miss Henders , " said the elder man . " Thought mebby you might want some advice or suthin ' . Anything we can do , we 're both at your service . " " That 's very kind of you , indeed , I 'm sure , " replied the girl ; " but really I have so many good friends here that I could n't think of inconveniencing you . Everyone has been so kind and considerate . " " Well , they ai n't no harm in offerin ' , " he continued . " Anything we can do , you know . If it 's  | a little matter of money to tide you over till the estate 's settled , why , just call on Jefferson Wainright  --  he 's got a lot and he ai n't stingy either . " " There is nothing , thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asperity . He rose slowly from his chair and shoved his fat hands into his pockets . " I reckon I 'll walk around a bit , " he said . " I calc'late that you young folks got suthin ' to say to one another , " and he winked ponderously at them as he waddled through the doorway . There was a strained silence for several minutes after he left . Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , finally , after clearing his throat two or three times , broke it . " The governor means all right , " he said . " We 'd really like to be of service to you , and after the ? the talk we had that last night before  --  before your father was killed  --  you know  --  why , I hoped I might have the right to help you , Diana . " She drew herself up very straight and stiff . " I think we had better forget that , Mr. Wainright , " she said . " But you promise .. me an answer , " he insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the answer must be without being subjected to the humiliation of being told in words . " " Do you mean that you are blaming me , too , like the men did , for going for help . You would all have been killed if I had n't . I think I did just the sensible thing , " he concluded , half defiantly .  | " Yes , I suppose so , " she replied icily , " and Hal Colby did a very silly thing staying and risking his life for Dad and me . " " I think you 're mighty unfair , Diana , " he insisted , " and the way it turned out only goes to prove that I was right . I met Bull and that Texas person less than half way to camp and got them there in time . " " If they had been as sensible as you they would have gone on to camp for more reinforcements , as you did , but like most of our boys out here , Mr. Wainright , they have n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to us  --  only two of them , remember , after you had told them that we were surrounded by a hundred Indians . " " Oh , pshaw , I think you might be reasonable and make some allowance for a fellow , " he begged . " I 'll admit I was a little excited and maybe I did do the wrong thing , but it 's all new to me out here . I 'd never seen a wild Indian before and I thought I was doing right to go for help . " Ca n't you forgive me , Diana , and give me another chance ? If you 'll marry me I 'll take you away from this God-forsaken country back where there are no Indians . " " Mr. Wainright , I have no wish to offend you , but you might as well know once for all that if you were the last man on earth I would never marry you  --  I could not marry a coward , and you are a coward . You would be just as much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boys are from the East  --  Hal Colby was born in Vermont  --  and the day that you ran away was his first experience , too , with hostile Indians , and if you want another reason why I could n't marry you ? the first and biggest reason  --  I 'll give it to you . " Her voice was low and level , like her father 's had been on the rare occasions that he had been moved by anger , but the tone was keen edged and cutting . " I feel now , and I shall always feel as long as I live , that had you remained instead of running away we might have held them off and Dad would not have been uselessly sacrificed . " She had risen while she spoke , and he rose too , standing silently for a moment after she had concluded . Then he turned and walked toward the door . At the threshold he paused and turned toward her . " I hope you will never regret your decision , " he said . The tone seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never . Good day , Mr. Wainright . " ' After he had gone the girl shuddered and sank down into a chair . She wished Hal Colby was there . She wanted someone to comfort her and to give her that sense of safety under masculine protection that her father 's presence had always afforded . Why could n't all men be like Hal and Bull ? When she thought of brave men she always thought of  | Bull , too . How wonderful they had all been that day  --  Hal and Bull and Pete . Rough , uncouth they often were ; worn and soiled and careless their apparel ; afraid of nothing , man , beast or the devil ; risking their lives joyously ; joking with death ; and yet they had been as gentle as women when they took her back to camp and all during the long , terrible journey home , when one of the three had always been within call every minute of the days and nights . Of the three Bull had surprised her most , for previously he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing fewer of the finer sensibilities of sympathy and tenderness ; but of them all he had been the most thoughtful and considerate . It had been he who had sent her ahead with Colby that she might not see them lash her father 's body to the horse ; it had been he who had covered all that remained of Elias Henders with the slickers from his saddle and Pete 's that she might not be shocked by the sight of her father 's body rocking from side to side with the swaying motion of the horse ; and it was Bull who had ridden all night to far-away ranches and brought back two buckboards early the next morning to carry her Dad and her more comfortably on the homeward journey . He had spoken kindly to her in an altered , softened voice , and he had insisted that she eat and keep her strength when she had wanted to forget food .  | But the funeral over she had seen nothing more of him , for he had been sent back to the round-up to ride with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained at the ranch to help her to plan for the future and gather together the stray ends that are left flying when even the most methodical of masters releases his grip for the last time . She sat musing after Wainright left the room , the clock upon the wall above her father 's desk ticking as it had for years ? just as though this terrible thing had not happened  --  just as though her father were still sitting in his accustomed chair , instead of lying out there in the sandy , desolate little graveyard above Hendersville , where the rocks that protected the scattered sleepers from the coyotes offered sanctuary to the lizard and the rattle-snake . Her revery was disturbed by the fall of heavy feet upon the veranda and she raised her eyes just as the elder Wainright entered the room . He was not smiling now , nor was his manner so suave as usual . " We got to be goin ' now , Miss Henders , " he said brusquely ; " but I wanted a mite of a word with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know nothin ' about it , but afore your father died we was negotiatin ' a deal . He wanted to get out from under , now that the mine 's runnin ' out , an ' I wanted to git a range on this side o ' the mountains . We 'd jest about got it all fixed up when this accident happened .  | " Now here 's what I wanted to say to you . Of course , the mine 's no account , and the range 's ' bout all fed off , and they ai n't scarce enough water fer the number o ' stock I was calc'latin ' to put on , but Jefferson Wainright 's a man o ' his word an ' when I says to your father that I 'd give him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars fer his holdin 's I wo n't back down now , even if I do n't think they be worth so much as that . " I 'll get all the papers ready so 's ye wo n't have to go to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money an ' go back East to live like ye always wanted to , an ' like yer paw was fixin ' fer ye . " The deeper he got into the subject the faster he talked and the more he relapsed into the vernacular of his earlier days . Finally he paused . " What do ye say ? " he concluded . " The ranch is not for sale , Mr. Wainright , " she replied . He opened his little eyes and his big mouth simultaneously in surprise . " What 's thet  --  not for sale ? Why , you must be crazy , child . You do n't know what you 're talk-. in ' about . " " I know exactly what I am talking about , " she told him . " Father talked this all over with me and showed me your offer of a million dollars for our holdings . The ranch is not for sale , for a million dollars or any other price , to you , Mr. Wain-  | right , and be careful that you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man 's fat face became suddenly empurpled with rage and for a moment he was inarticulate as , backing toward the doorway , he sought for words adequately to express his outraged feelings . He was not humiliated  --  there are certain types of men whose thick skin serves them as an invulnerable armor against humiliation . He was just plain mad ? mad all the way through to think that he had been caught at his trickery , exposed and thwarted by a chit of a girl , and , like the type he represented naturally would be , he was mad at her rather than at himself . As he reached the doorway he found his voice . " You 'll be sorry for this ! You 'll be sorry for this ! " he cried , shaking a fist at her . " And , mark you , I 'll get this property yet . Jefferson Wainright can buy and sell you twenty times over and he always gets what he goes after . " The figure of a tall man loomed suddenly behind him . Calloused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat . A low voice spoke softly in his ear . " Do n't you know better'n to shake your fist in a lady 's face , you pot-bellied buzzard ? " it inquired , and the elder Wainright was jerked unceremoniously through the doorway , whirled about and projected violently from the veranda , his speed simultaneously accelerated by the toe of a high-  | heeled cowboy boot . " I reckon you 'd better make yourself damned scarce around here , " continued the low tones of the speaker . Wainright scrambled to his feet and turned upon the owner of the voice . He shook both fists now and fairly danced up and down in his fury . " I 'll get you ! " he screamed . " I 'll get you ! Do n't you know who I am  --  why , I could buy and sell you a hundred thousand times over  --  I 'm Jefferson Wainright , I am . I 'll get you  --  layin ' your hands on me  --  you low down , thirty-five dollar cow-puncher ! " " Vamoose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronto . " He emphasized his injunction with a shot , the bullet kicking up a little spurt of dust between Wainright 's feet . The fat man started on a run for his buck-board which the younger Wainright had driven down to the corrals . The man on the veranda fired again , and again the dust rose about the fleeing feet of the terrified Easterner . Diana Henders had come to the doorway where she stood leaning against the frame , smiling . " Do n't hurt him , Bull , " she said . The man cast a quick smile over his shoulder . " I ai n't a-aimin ' to hurt him , " he said . " I 'm just a-aimin ' to eddicate him . Them corn-fed Easterners ai n't got no eddication nohow . What they need is someone to larn ' em manners . " As he spoke he kept on firing at the fleeing Wain-  | right and every shot kicked up a puff of dust close to the fat man 's feet until he reached the corner of the bunk-house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook and the few men who were about , with the result that a small yet highly appreciative audience witnessed Wainright 's discomfiture . A part of it was Texas Pete , who rocked to and fro in unholy glee . " By gollies ! did you see him ? " he yelled . " He never hit nothin ' but the high spots . I 'll bet he busted all the world 's records between the office and the bunk-house . Why , he done it in nothin ' flat , an ' you could have played checkers on his coat-tails . He shore stepped high , wide an ' handsome . " On the veranda of the ranch house Bull had shoved his gun back into its holster . The smile had left his face . " I thought you were still out with the outfit , Bull , " said the girl . " We finished up . last night , " he told her , " and I come in ahead . " He looked down at his feet in evident embarrassment . " I come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! Why , Bull , you 're not goin ' to quit ? " " I reckon I better , " he replied . " I been aimin ' to move on fer some spell . " The girl 's eyes were wide , and almost noticeably moist , and there was a surprised , hurt look in them , that he caught as he chanced to glance up at her .  | " You see , Miss , " he hastened to explain , " things ai n't very pleasant for me here . I ai n't complainin ' , but there are those that do n't like me , an ' I figgered I 'd quit before I was let out . As long as your paw was alive it was different , an ' I do n't need to tell you that I 'd be powerful proud to work for you always , if there was n't no one else ; but there is . I reckon you got a good man an ' it will be pleasanter all around if I ai n't here no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump rose in Diana Henders ' throat , and she realized how much she had come to depend on him  --  just the mere fact that she had known Bull was around had given her a feeling of greater security  --  he had become in the nature of a habit and it was going to be hard to break the habit . " Oh , Bull , " she cried , " I ca n't let you go now ? I ca n't spare both you and Dad at the same time . You 're like a brother , Bull , and I need a brother mighty badly right now . You do n't have to go , do you ? You do n't really want to ? " " No , Miss , I do n't have to an ' I do n't want to ? if you want me to stay . " " Then you will stay ? " He nodded . " But I reckon ' you 'd better tell Colby , " he said , " for I expect he 's aimin ' to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure he 's not , " she cried . " Hal likes you , Bull . He told me you were one of his best friends , and he was so sorry about your losing  | the job as foreman . He said he hated to take it . " Bull made no comment and whatever his thoughts his face did not betray them . Presently he jerked his head in the general direction of the corrals where the Wainrights , having hastily clambered into their buck-board , were preparing to depart . " Say the word , " he told her , " and I 'll run them short sports so far outta the country they wo n't never find their way back . " " No , " she replied , smiling ; " let them go . They 'll never come back here , I 'm sure . " " I reckon the old gent figgers he ai n't very popular round these diggins , " said Bull , with the faintest trace of a smile ; " but I do n't know so much about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana . " About deuce high , Bull , " she replied . " I saw enough of him to last me a couple of life times the day the renegades jumped us . " " I reckoned as much , Miss , knowin ' you as I do . Scenery an ' the gift o ' gab ai n't everything , but sometimes they fool wimmen folks  --  even the brightest of ' em . " " He was awfully good company , " she admitted . " When they war n't no Injuns around , " Bull completed the sentence for her . " The old feller seemed all het up over somethin ' about the time I happened along . I heered him say he was set on gettin ' this property . Is that what they come over fer ? "  | " Yes . He offered me a quarter of what he 'd offered Dad for it , and his offer to Dad was only about twenty per cent of what it 's worth . You see , Bull , what they want is the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an excuse to get hold of the mine because they think we do n't know the real value of the diggings ; but Dad did know . There 's another vein there that has never been tapped that is richer than the old one . Dad knew about it , and somehow Wainright learned of it too . " " The old skunk ! " muttered Bull . The Wainrights were driving out of the ranch yard and heading toward Hendersville . The older man was still breathing hard and swearing to himself . The younger was silent and glum . They were going to town for dinner before starting on the long drive back to their ranch . Approaching them along the trail at a little distance ahead was a horseman . Young Wainright recognized the rider first . " That 's Colby , " he said . " He has n't any use for that fellow Bull . They are both stuck on the girl . It might not be a bad plan to cultivate him ? if you want to get even with Bull . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them with nothing more than a nod . He did not like either of them ? especially the younger ; but when they drew rein and the older man called to him he turned about and rode up to the side of the vehicle .  | " You 're still foreman here , ai n't ye ? " asked Wainright senior . Colby nodded . " Why ? " he inquired . " Well , I jest wanted to tell ye that some of your men ai n't got a very pleasant way of treatin ' neighbors . " " How 's that ? " " Well , I was jest a-leavin ' after a social call when one of yer men starts shootin ' at me . Thet ai n't no way to treat friends an ' neighbors . Suppose we was to shoot up your men when they came over our way ? " " Who was it ? " demanded Colby . " Bull , " said the younger Wainright . " I suppose he was drunk again , though . They say he always goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up at the house making love to Miss Henders , " he added . " I should n't think she 'd feel safe with a fellow like that around . " Colby scowled . " Thanks fer tellin ' me , " he said . " I reckon I 'll have to fix that feller . He 's gettin ' too damn fresh . " " Well , I thought ye 'd orter know , " said Wainright senior . " Well , so long , an ' if ye ever git over our way drop in . " " Giddap ! " said Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , and the two rolled away through the deep dust of the parched road . Colby rode on at a brisk gallop and as he swung from his saddle cast a glance in the direction of the  | house where he saw Bull just descending the steps from the veranda where Diana Henders stood . Colby bit his lip and the frown on his face became deeper . Dragging saddle and bridle from his pony he turned the animal into the corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too gentle slap which reflected the state of his feelings  --  then he headed straight for the bunk-house which he reached just in time to intercept Bull at the entrance . " Look here , Bull , " said Colby without any preamble , " this business of drinkin ' an ' shootin ' things up has gone about far enough . I ai n't a-goin ' to have it around here no more . I reckon you 'd better ask fer your time . " " All right , " said Bull , " you go an ' git it fer me while I 'm packin ' my war-bag . " Colby , rather surprised and at the same time relieved that Bull took the matter so philosophically , started for the office , while the latter entered the bunk-house , where Shorty , Texas Pete and a couple of others who had overheard the conversation outside the door looked up questioningly . " By gollies ! " exclaimed Texas Pete , " I 'm a-goin ' to quit . I 'm a-goin ' after my time right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . " Wait a minute , old hoss , " advised Bull . " I ai n't went yet . " " But did n't Colby jest let you out ? " inquired Pete .  | " He might change his mind , " explained Bull . Up at the house Colby was entering the office . " Hello , Di ! " he cried . " Got your check-book handy ? " " Yes , why ? " " Bull 's quittin ' . " " Quitting ? Why , he just promised me that he 'd stay on . I do n't understand . " " He just promised you that he 'd stay on ! You mean you asked him to ? " " Yes , " replied Diana . " He came up here to quit . Said he thought he was n't wanted any more , and I made him promise he would n't leave . I tell you , Hal , we could never replace him . Are you sure he was in earnest about quitting ? Send him up here and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not I was mistaken , " said Colby . " I reckon Bull was jest a-kiddin ' . I 'll ask him again and if he is plumb set on leavin ' I 'll send him up . " When he entered the bunk-house a few minutes later he nodded at Bull . " You kin stay on , if you want to , " he said ; " I 've changed my mind . " Bull winked at Texas Pete who was vainly endeavoring to remember another verse of the seemingly endless self-glorification of the bad hombre . " By gollies ! " he exclaimed , " I believe I got an-other : " He twirls two big guns an ' he shoots out a light ; The fellows a-drinkin ' there ducks out o ' sight ;  | He shoots through a bottle thet stands on the bar ; An ' shoots the of ashes plumb off my seegar . " " But it seems like I 'd left out somethin ' thet orter a-gone before . " " Nobody 'd git sore if you left it all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you uneddicated cow-punchers , " Texas Pete told him , " is thet you are too allfired ignorant to appreciate my efforts to elivate you-all by means of good poetry . It shore is hell to be the only lit'ry gent in a bunch of rough-necks . " Come , set up the bottles , you gol darned galoot , ' Says he to the boss , " Fore I opens yore snoot With one o ' these yere little babies o ' mine , ' An ' shoots out the no in the no credit sign . "  | CHAPTER VIII " YOU DO N'T DARE ! " THE stage lurched down the steep and tortuous gradiant of Hell 's Bend Pass , bumped through the rutty gap at the bottom and swung onto the left fork just beyond . The right fork was the regular stage route to Hendersville . The left hand road led to town , too , but over Bar Y property and past the home ranch . The driver never came this way unless he had passengers , express or important messages for the ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually in better repair . Today he had a telegram for Diana Henders . There was a brief pause as he drew up his sweating team in the road before the ranch house , yelled to attract the attention of a ranch-hand working about the corrals , tossed the envelope into the road and then , with a crack of his long whip , was off again at a run , leaving billowing clouds of powdery dust in his wake . The man working in the corrals walked leisurely into the road , picked up the envelope and , after scrutinizing the superscription and deciphering it laboriously , carried the message to the office , where Diana Henders was working over the books .  | " Telegram fer ye , Miss , " announced the man , crossing the room to hand it to her . She thanked him and laid the envelope on the desk beside her as she completed an interrupted footing . The arrival of telegrams was no uncommon occurrence even on that far-away ranch , and as they always pertained to business they caused Diana no flurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manill used the comparatively new telegraph facilities upon the slightest pretext . The footing finally checked to her satisfaction , Diana picked up the envelope , opened it and drew forth the message . At first she glanced at it casually , then she read it over again with knit brows as though unable fully to grasp the purport of its contents . Finally she sat staring at it with wide , strained eyes , until , apparently crushed , she lowered her head upon her arms and broke into sobs , for this is what she had read : MISS DIANA HENDERS , BAR Y RANCH , HENDERSVILLE , VIA ALDEA , ARIZONA . Mr. Manill died suddenly last night . Miss Manill and I leave for ranch soon as possible after funeral . MAURICE B. CORSON . For a long time Diana Henders sat with her face buried in her arms . Gradually her sobs subsided as she gained control of herself . Stunning though the effect of this new blow was , yet she grasped enough of what it meant to her to be almost crushed  | by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manill since childhood , he had , nevertheless , constituted a very real and potent force in her existence . Her mother had adored him , her only brother , and Elias Henders had never ceased to proclaim him as the finest type of honorable gentleman that nature might produce . His Eastern connections , his reputation for integrity and his fine business acumen had all been potent factors in the success of the Henders and Manill partnership . With the death of her father the girl had felt keenly only her personal loss ? for Uncle John Manill loomed as a Rock of Gibraltar to protect her in all matters of business ; but now she was absolutely alone . There was no one to whom she might turn for counsel or advice now that these two were gone . Hal Colby , she realized keenly , was at best only a good cowman  --  in matters requiring executive ability or large financial experience he was untried . Of Corson , Manill 's attorney , she knew nothing , but she was reasonably sure that even though he proved honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern office , he would not be competent to direct the affairs of ranch and mine at the sources of production . That she might have carried on herself under the guidance of John Manill she had never doubted , since she could always have turned to him for advice in matters of moment where she was doubtful of  | her own judgment ; but without him she questioned her ability to direct the destinies of this great business with all its numerous ramifications . Suddenly she arose and replaced the books in the office safe , dabbed at her tear-dimmed eyes with her handkerchief and , putting on her sombrero , walked from the office , adjusting her wavy hair beneath the stiff band of her heavy hat . Straight toward the corrals she made her way . She would saddle Captain and ride out into the sunshine and the fresh air where , of all other places , she knew she might find surcease of sorrow and an opportunity to think out her problems more clearly . As she entered the corral Hal Colby came running up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Ridin ' , Di ? " he asked . She nodded affirmatively . She was not sure that she wanted company  --  not even that of Hal Colby  --  today when she desired to be alone with her grief . " You were n't goin ' alone , were you ? You know it ai n't safe , Di . Your dad would n't have let you an ' I certainly wo n't . " She made no reply . She knew that he was right . It was not safe for her to ride alone , but today she felt that she did not care what happened to her . Fate had been cruel  --  there was little more that it could do to harm her . In a way she half resented Hal 's new air of  | proprietorship , and yet there was something about it that carried a suggestion of relief from responsibility : Here there was at least someone who cared ? someone upon whose broad shoulders she might shift a portion of her burden , and so she did not follow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the corral , turning down the road toward town and neither spoke for several minutes , after the manner of people accustomed to being much together in the saddle . The man , as was usual with him when they rode , watched her profile as a lover of art might gloat over a beautiful portrait , and as he looked at her he realized the change that had come over her face and noted the reddened lids . " What 's the matter , Di ? " he asked presently . " You look like you 'd been cryin ' . What 's hap-pened ? " " I just got a telegram from New York , Hal , " she replied . " Uncle John is dead  --  he died night before last . The stage just brought the message in from Aldea . " " Shucks , " he said , at a loss for the proper words , and then , " that 's shore too bad , Di . " " It leaves me all alone , now , Hal , " she continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " You ai n't all alone , Di . There ai n't anything I would n't do for you . You know I love you , Di . Wo n't you marry me ? It would make it easier all around for you if we was married . There 's them  | that 's always tryin ' to take advantage of a girl or a woman what 's left alone , but if you got a husband you got someone to look out for you an ' your rights . I got a little money saved up . " " I have plenty of money , Hal . " " I know it . I wish you did n't have none . It makes me feel like you thought that was what I was after , but it ai n't . Wo n't you , Di ? Together we could run the ranch just like your dad was here . " " I do n't know , Hal . I do n't know what to do . I think I love you , but I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is . " " You 'd learn to love me , " he told her , " and you would n't have to worry no more . I 'd look after everything . Say yes , wo n't you ? " The temptation was great  --  greater even than the man himself realized  --  to have a place to lay her tired head , to have a strong man to carry the burden and the responsibilities for her , to have the arm of love about her as it had been all her life until her father had been taken away . She looked up at him with a faint smile . " I wo n't say yes  --  yet , " she said . " Wait a while , Hal  --  wait until after Mr. Corson and my cousin come and we see how things are going to turn out , and then  --  then I think that I shall say yes . " He leaned toward her impulsively and put an arm about her , drawing her toward him with the evident intention of kissing her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal , " she told him ; " wait until I have said yes . " A week later a group of boarders were lounging on the veranda of The Donovan House in Hendersville . It was almost supper time of a stage day and the stage had not yet arrived . Mack Harber , whose wound had given more trouble than the doctor had expected , was still there convalescing , and Mary Donovan was , as usual , standing in the doorway joining in the gossip and the banter " Bill ai n't niver late ' less somethin 's wrong , " said Mrs. Donovan . " Like as not he 's been held up again , " suggested Mack . " I 'd like to be sheriff o ' this yere county fer ' bout a week , " stated Wildcat Bob . " Sure , an ' phawt would ye be after doin ' ? " inquired Mary Donovan , acidly . Wildcat Bob subsided , mumbling in his stained beard . For the moment he had forgotten that Mrs. Donovan was among those present . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clank of chain , the creaking of springs , and the rapid pounding of galloping hoofs the stage swung into the single street of Hendersville in a cloud of dust and with a final shrieking of protesting brakes pulled up before The Donovan House . " Where 's Gum Smith ? " demanded Bill Gatlin from the driver 's seat .  | " Du n no . Held up agin ? " asked one of the loungers . " Yes , " snapped Gatlin . Mack Harber had risen from his chair and advanced to the edge of the veranda . " The Black Coyote ? " he asked . Gatlin nodded . " Where 's thet damn sheriff ? " he demanded again . " He ai n't here an ' he would n't be no good if he was , " replied Wildcat Bob . " We do n't need no sheriff fer what we oughter do , " announced Mack Harber , angrily . " How 's thet ? " asked Wildcat . " You do n't need no sheriff fer a necktie party , " said Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get yer man fust . " " Thet 's plumb easy . " " How come ? " inquired Wildcat . " We all know who The Black Coyote is , " stated Mack . " All we got ta do is get a rope an ' go get him . " " Meanin ' get who ? " insisted the little old man . " Why , gosh all hemlock ! you know as well as I do thet it 's Bull , " replied Mack . " I du n no nothin ' o ' the kind , young feller , " said Wildcat Bob , " ner neither do you . Ef ye got proof of what ye say I 'm with ye . Ef ye ai n't got proof I 'm ag'in ye . " " Do n't Bull always wear a black silk handkerchief ? " demanded Mack . " Well , so does The  | Black Coyote , an ' they both got scars on their chins . There ai n't no doubt of it . " " So ye want to string up Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? Well , ye ai n't goin ' to do nothin ' o ' the kind while of Wildcat Bob can fan a gun . Git proof on him an : I 'll be the fust to put a rope ' round his neck , but ye got to git more proof than a black handkerchief . " " Shure an ' fer once yer right , ye ould blatherskite , " commended Mary Donovan . " Be after comin ' to yer suppers now the all of yese an ' fergit stringin ' up dacent young min like Bull . Shure an ' I do n't belave he iver hild up nothin ' at all , at all . He 's that nice to me whinever he 's here , wid his Mrs. Donovan , mum , this an ' his Mrs. Donovan , mum , that , an ' a-fetchin ' wood fer me , which the loikes o ' none o ' yese iver did . The viry idea ov him bein ' The Black Coyote  --  go on wid ye ! " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway  --  we might string him up , " insisted Mack . " We do n't know that neither , " contradicted Wildcat ; " but when it comes to stringin ' up Gregorio or any other greaser I 'm with ye . Go out an ' git him , Mack , an ' I 'll help ye string him up . " A general grin ran around the table , for of all the known badmen in the country the Mexican , Gregorio , was by far the worst . To have gone out looking for him and to have found him would have been equivalent to suicide for most men , and though there were many men in the county who would not  | have hesitated had necessity demanded , the fact remained that his hiding place was unknown and that that fact alone would have rendered an attempt to get him a failure . " Thar 's only one way to git them , sonny , " continued Wildcat Bob , " an ' thet is to put a man on the stage with the bullion , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You was there when they got me , " he fired back . " You was there with two big six-guns an ' what did you do  --  eh ? What did you do ? " " I was n't hired to guard no bullion , an ' I was n't sittin ' on the box with no sawed-off shotgun ' crost my knees , neither . I was a-ridin ' inside with a lady . What could I a-done ? " He looked around at the others at the table for vindication . " Ye could n't done nothin ' , ye , " said Mary Donovan , " widout a quart o ' barbed-wire inside ye an ' some poor innocent tenderfoot to shoot the heels offen him . " Wildcat Bob fidgeted uneasily and applied himself to his supper , pouring his tea into his saucer , blowing noisily upon it to cool it , and then sucking it through his whiskers with an accompanying sound not unlike snoring ; but later he was both mollified and surprised by a second , generous helping of dessert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch it caused the usual flurry of profanity and speculation . It was brought by a belated  | puncher who had ridden in from the West ranch by way of Hendersville . The men were gathered at the evening meal and of a sudden a silence fell upon them as they realized , apparently simultaneously and for the first time , that there was a single absentee . The meal progressed in almost utter silence then until they had reached the pudding , when Bull walked in , dark and taciturn , and with the brief nod that was his usual greeting to his fellows . The meal continued in silence for a few minutes until the men who had finished began pushing back their plates preparatory to rising . " I reckon you know the stage was held up again , Bull , an ' the bullion stolen , " remarked Hal Colby , selecting a tooth-pick from the glassful on the table . " How should I know it ? " asked Bull . " Ai n't I ben up Sink Hole Canyon all day ? I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , it was , " said Colby . " The same two slick gents done it , too . " " Did they git much ? " asked Bull . " It was a big shipment , " said Colby . " It always is . They do n't never touch nothin ' else an ' they seem to know when we 're shippin ' more'n ordinary . Looks suspicious . " " Did you just discover that ? " inquired Bull . " No , I discovered it a long time ago , an ' it may help me to find out whose doin ' it . " " Well , I wish you luck , " and Bull resumed his meal .  | Colby , having finished , rose from the table and made his way to the house . In the cozy sittingroom he found Diana at the piano , her fingers moving dreamily over the ivory keys . " Some more bad news , Di , " he announced . She turned wearily toward him . " What now ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Was anyone hurt ? " " No , " he assured her . " I am glad of that . The gold is nothing ? I would rather lose it all than have one of the boys killed . I have told them all , just as Dad did , to take no chances . If they could get him without danger to themselves I should be glad , but I could not bear to have one of our boys hurt for all the gold in the mine . " " I think The Black Coyote knows that , " he said , " and that 's what makes him so all-fired nervy . He 's one of our own men , Di  --  ca n't you see it ? He knows when the shipments are big an ' do n't never touch a little one , an ' he knows your Dad 's orders about not takin ' no chances . " I 've hated to think it , but there ai n't no other two ways about it  --  it 's one o ' our men  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to put my finger on him , neither . " " I do n't believe it ! " she cried . " I do n't believe that one of my men would do it . " " You do n't want to believe it , that 's all . You  | know just as well as I do whose doin ' it , down in the bottom of your heart . I do n't like to believe it no more'n you do , Di ; but I ai n't blind an ' I hate to see you bein ' made a fool of an ' robbed into the bargain . I do n't believe you 'd believe it , though , if I caught him in the act . " " I think I know whom you suspect , Hal , " she replied , " but I am sure you are wrong . " " Will you give me a chance to prove it ? " " How ? " " Send him up to the mine to guard the bullion until Mack gits well an ' then keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " I 'll bet my shirt thet either there ai n't no holdups fer a month or else they 's only one man pulls ' em off instead o ' two . Will you do it ? " " It is n't fair . I do n't even suspect him . " " Everybody else does an ' thet makes it fair fer it gives him a chance to prove it if he ai n't guilty . " " It would n't prove anything , except that there were no holdups while he was on duty . " " It would prove something to my mind if they started up again pretty soon after he was taken off the job , " he retorted . " Well ? it might , but I do n't think I 'd ever be-. lieve it of him unless I saw him with my own eyes . " " Pshaw ! the trouble with you is you 're soft on him  --  you do n't care if your gold is stole if he gits it . " She drew herself to her full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter further , " she said . " Good night ! " He grabbed his hat viciously from the piano and stamped toward the doorway . There he turned about and confronted her again for a parting shot before he strode out into the night . " You do n't dare try it ! " ( he flung at her . " You do n't dare ! " After he had gone she sat biting her lip half in anger and half in mortification , but after the brief tempest of emotion had subsided she commenced to question her own motives impartially . Was she afraid ? Was it true that she did not dare ? And long after she had gone to bed , and sleep would not come , she continued thus to catechize herself . As Hal Colby burst into the bunk-house and slammed the door behind him the sudden draft thus created nearly extinguished the single lamp that burned upon an improvised table at which four men sat at poker . Bull and Shorty , Texas Pete and one called Idaho sat in the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softly , as the lamp resumed functioning after emitting a thin , protesting spiral of black soot . " I see that an ' raise you my pile , " said Bull , shoving several small stacks of silver toward the center of the table . " How much you got there ? " inquired Idaho , the others having dropped out . Bull counted . " There 's your ten , " he said , " an '  | here 's ten , fifteen , twenty-five ? " He continued counting in a monotone . " Ninety-six , " he announced . " I raise you ninety-six dollars , Idaho . " " I ai n't got ninety-six dollars , " said Idaho . " I only got eight . " " You got a saddle , ai n't you ? " inquired Bull , sweetly . " An ' a shirt , " suggested Texas Pete . " My saddle 's worth three hundred an ' fifty dollars if it 's worth a cent , " proclaimed Idaho . " No one ai n't never said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll cover it an ' call you , " announced Bull . " I do n't want your shirt , Idaho , it 's full o ' holes . " " What you coverin ' it with ? " asked Idaho . " I do n't see nothin ' . " Bull rose from the table . " Wait a second , " he said , and stepped to his blankets where he rummaged for a moment in his war-bag . When he returned to the table he tossed a small buckskin bag among his silver . " They 's five hundred dollars ' worth of dust in that , " he said . " If you win we kin weigh out what 's comin ' to you over at the office tomorrow mornin ' . " Hal Colby looked on  --  an interested spectator . The others fell silent . Texas Pete knit his brows in perplexity . " Let 's see it , " demanded Idaho . Bull nicked up the bag , opened it and poured a  | stream of yellow particles into his palm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you got ? " demanded Bull . Idaho laid four kings on the table , smiling broadly . " Four aces , " said Bull , and raked in the pot . " Why did n't you raise him ? " demanded Shorty . " I just told you I did n't want his shirt , " said Bull , " an ' I do n't want your saddle , neither , kid . I 'll keep the money  --  it ai n't good fer kids like you to have too much money  --  but you keep the saddle . " " I 'm goin ' to turn in , " said Shorty , pushing back and rising . " You 'd all better turn in an ' give someone else a chance to sleep , " said the foreman . " What with your damn game an ' Pete 's singin ' a feller ai n't got no more chance to sleep around here than a jack-rabbit . Why do n't you fellers crawl in ? " " Crawl in ! Crawl in ! " exclaimed Texas Pete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got another verse ! " The boss he crawls out then , all shaky an ' white , From under the bar where he 's ben sittin ' tight . Now set out the pizen right pronto , you coot , ' The stranger remarks , Or I shore starts to shoot , I only ben practicin ' so far , ' says he ; A bar-keep er two do n't mean nothin ' to me . Most allus I has one fer breakfast each day I do n't mean no harm ? it 's jest only my way . ' "  | CHAPTER IX LILLIAN MANILL YOU sent fer me , Miss ? " asked Bull , as he stepped into the office the following morning , his hat in his hand , his chaps loose-buckled about his trim hips , his two big six-guns a trifle forward against the need for quick action , the black silk handkerchief falling over the blue shirt that stretched to his deep chest , and his thick , black hair pushed back in an unconscious , half pompadour . From silver-mounted spurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his day . There was no item of his clothing or equipment the possession of which was not prompted by utilitarian considerations . There was ornamentation , but it was obviously secondary to the strict needs of his calling . Nothing that he wore was shabby , yet it all showed use to an extent that made each article seem a part of the man , as though he had been molded into them . Nothing protruded with stiff awkwardness ? even the heavy guns appeared to fit into accustomed hollows and become a part of the man . The girl , swinging about in her chair to face him , felt a suggestion of stricture in her throat , and she felt mean and small and contemptible as she looked  | into the eyes of the man she knew loved her and contemplated the thing she was about to do ; yet she did not hesitate now that she had , after a night of sleepless deliberation , committed herself to it . " Yes , , I sent for you , Bull , " she replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mack wo n't be fit for work again for a long time and I 've got to have someone to guard the bullion shipments  --  the fellow who came down with it yesterday has quit . He said he was too young to commit suicide . " " Yes 'm , " said Bull . " I do n't want you to take any chances , Bull ? I would rather lose the gold than have  --  you hurt . " " I wo n't get hurt , Miss . " " You do n't mind doing it ? " she asked . " O ' course I 'm a puncher , " he said ; " but I do n't mind doin ' it  --  not fer you . I told you once thet I 'd do anything fer you , Miss , an ' I was n't jest talkin ' through my hat . " " You do n't do everything I ask you to , Bull , " she said , smiling . " What do n't I do ? " he demanded . " You still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're more like a brother , Bull , and Miss sounds so format " It must have been a woman who first discovered the art of making fire . A shadow of pain crossed his dark countenance . " Do n't ask too much of me , Miss , " he said quietly as he turned on his heel and started for the door-  | way . " I go up to the mine today , I suppose ? " he threw back over his shoulder . " Yes , today , " she said , and he was gone . For a long time Diana Henders was troubled . The assignment she had given Bull troubled her , for it was a tacit admission that she gave credence to Colby 's suspicions . The pain that she had seen reflected in Bull 's face troubled her , as did his parting words and the quiet refusal to call her Diana . She wondered if these had been prompted by a feeling of pique that his love was not returned , or compunction because of a guilty knowledge that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that morning of the bag of gold dust Bull had displayed in the poker game the night before , and that troubled her too , for it seemed to bear out more than anything else the suspicions that were forming around him  --  suspicions that she could see , in the light of hits of circumstantial evidence , were far from groundless . " I wo n't believe it ! " she said half aloud . " I wo n't believe it ! " and then she went for a ride . All the men had left but Hal Colby and Texas Pete when she reached the corrals ; but she did not feel like riding with Hal Colby that morning and so she rode with Texas Pete , much to that young man 's surprise and rapture . The days dragged along and became weeks , the stage made its two trips a week , the bullion ship-  | ments came through regularly and safely and there were no holdups , and then one day Maurice B. Corson and Lillian Manill arrived . The stage took the Bar Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch house just as Diana Henders and Hal Colby were returning from a trip to the West Ranch . Diana saw Lillian Manill for the first time in her life . The eastern girl was seated between Bill Gatlin , the driver , and Bull . All three were laughing . Evidently they had been enjoying one another 's company . Diana could not but notice it because it was rarely that Bull laughed . It was Bull who stepped to the wheel and helped her to alight . Maurice B. Corson emerged from the inside of the coach , through the windows of which Diana could see three other passengers , two of whom she recognized as the Wainrights , and then she dismounted and ran forward to greet her cousin , a handsome , dark haired girl of about her own age . Bull , still smiling , raised his hat to Diana . She nodded to him , briefly . For some reason she was vexed with him , but why she did not know . Bull and Colby ran to the boot and dragged off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corson was a young man  --  a typical New Yorker  --  in his early thirties . " Git a move on there , Bull , " shouted Gatlin , " or they 'll think I ben held up agin . " " I reckon The Black Coyote 's gone out o ' busi-  | ness , fer a while , " said Colby , shooting a quick look at Diana . Instantly the girl 's loyalty was in arms , " He 's afraid to try it while Bull 's guarding the gold , " she said . " How much longer you goin ' to keep me on the job ? " asked Bull , as he clambered to the seat of the already moving coach . " Mack looks pretty allfired healthy to me . " " Just another week or two , Bull , " Diana shouted after him as the stage careened away at full gallop . " Is n't he wonderful ! " exclaimed Miss Manill . " A real cowboy and the first one I ever talked to ! " " Oh , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as nice as Bull . " " So I see , " replied Lillian Manill , smiling frankly at Hal Colby , " but Bull , as you call him , is the only one I 've met . " " Pardon me ! " exclaimed Diana . " This is Mr. Colby , Miss Manill . " " Oh , you 're the foreman  --  Mr. Bull told me ? how exciting ! " " I 'll bet he did n't tell you nothin ' good about me , " said Colby . " He told me about your heroic defense of Diana and my poor uncle , " explained Lillian . Colby flushed . " If it had n't ben fer Bull we 'd all ' a ' ben killed , " he said , ashamed . " Why , he did n't tell me that , " exclaimed the girl . " He never said he was in the battle , at all . "  | " That is just like Bull , " said Diana . They were walking toward the house , Diana and Colby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the various buildings and corrals over which hung the glamour of that irresistible romance which the West and a cattle ranch always hold for the uninitiated  --  and for the initiated too , if the truth were but known . " It is just too wonderful , Mr. Colby , " Lillian confided to the big foreman walking at her side ; " but does n't it get awful lonesome ? " " We do n't notice it , " he replied . " You know we keep pretty busy all day with a big outfit like this and when night comes around we 're ready to turn in  --  we do n't have no time to git lonesome . " " Is this a very big outfit , as you call it ? " she asked . " I reckon they ai n't none much bigger in the territory , " he replied . " And to think that you are foreman of it ! What a wonderful man you must be ! " " Oh , it ai n't nothin ' , " he assured her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young lady of discernment . " You big men of the great out-doors are always so modest , " she told him , a statement for which he could find no reply . As a matter of fact , though he had never thought of it before , he realized the justice of her assertion , and fully agreed with her . She was looking now at the trim figure of her  | cousin , walking ahead of them with Corson . " How becoming that costume is to Diana , " she remarked ; " and I suppose she rides wonderfully . " " She shore does  --  an ' then some , " he assured her . " Oh , how I wish I could ride ! Do you suppose I could learn ? " " Easy , Miss . It ai n't nothin ' , oncet you know how . " " Do you suppose someone would teach me ? " She looked up at him , archly . " I 'd be mighty proud to larn you , Miss . " " Oh , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? " " You bet we can ; but you ca n't ride in them things , " he added , looking ruefully at her New York traveling costume . She laughed gaily . " Oh , my ! I did n't expect to , " she cried . " I am not such a silly as that . I brought my habit with me , of course . " " Well , I suppose it 's all right , " he said politely ; " but you do n't have to bring no habits to Arizony from nowheres ? we mostly have enough right here , such as they be  --  good an ' bad . " Again her laugh rang out . " You big , funny man ! " she cried . " You are poking fun at me just because you think I am a tendershoe  --  trying to make me believe that you do n't know what a riding habit is . Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? teasing poor little me ? "  | They were passing the bunk-house at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatting about on their heels watching the newcomers with frank curiosity . After they had passed Shorty gave Texas Pete a shove that sent him sprawling on the ground . " Say , " he said , " did you see them pants ? " " I shore did , " replied Pete , " but you do n't have no call to knock me down an ' git my ridin ' habit all dusty , you gosh-dinged tendershoe , jest because a guy blows in with funny pants on . " " Did you see the mug on Colby ? " inquired Idaho . " He do n't know a ridin ' habit from the cigarette habit . " " I reckon he thought she was confessin ' a sin , " said Texas Pete . " Oh , them pants ! Them pants ! " moaned Shorty , rocking to and fro on his heels , his long arms wound around his knees . Shorty was six feet three and thought that Kansas City was on the Atlantic seaboard . Corson 's keen , quick eyes were taking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Diana 's side toward the two-story adobe ranch house , on two sides of which a broad , covered veranda had been built within recent years . He saw the orderly , well kept appearance not only of the main buildings , but of the corrals , fences and outbuildings as well . Everything bespoke system and excellent management . It was evidently  | a well-ordered plant in smooth running condition . He thought of it in terms of Eastern factories and found it good . " You keep things up well here , " he said to Diana Henders . " I want to compliment you . " " Thank you , " she replied . " It was something that Dad always insisted upon , and of course I have carried out all his policies since his death . " " What are these buildings  --  they look like cement , but of course you would n't have that out here . The freight on it would make the cost prohibitive . " " They are adobe , " she explained , " just big , clay bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing much very fancy about the architecture , " he commented , laughing . " The only attempt at ornamentation is that sort of parapet on the roof of the house , with the loop-holes in it , and that does n't add much to the looks of the place . " Diana thought that his criticisms were in rather poor taste , and there was something about them that vaguely suggested the air of a man viewing for the first time a property that he had only recently acquired  --  something proprietorial that she inwardly resented . Outwardly she was polite . " You would think that it added a lot to the place , " she told him , " if you should ever chance to be here when the Apaches stage a raid  --  it was never intended to be ornamental . "  | He sucked in his breath with a whistling sound . " You do n't mean , " he exclaimed , " that they are so bad you have to live in a fortress ? " " They have n't been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she assured him ; " but that parapet has been used more than once since the house was built , and there is always the chance that it may come in handy again . It may not be beautiful from this side , but I can tell you that it looks mighty good from the other side when there are sneaking Apaches skulking behind every out-house . I know , because I 've viewed it under those conditions . " " You think there is any great danger ? " he asked her , looking about nervously . " There is always danger , " she replied , for she saw that he was afraid and a spirit of mischief prompted her to avenge his indelicate criticisms of the home she loved . " It is only a matter of weeks , you know , " she reminded him , " since Dad was killed by Apaches . " Corson appeared worried and his further scrutiny of the house as they approached it was influenced by other than artistic architectural considerations . " I see you have heavy shutters at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you have them closed and fastened every night ? " " Oh , my , no ! " she cried , laughing . " We never close them except for dust storms and Indians . " " But suppose they come unexpectedly ? "  | " Then we stand a chance of getting dust or Indians in the house . " " I think you had better have them closed nights while Miss Manill is here , " he said . " I am afraid she will be very nervous . " " Oh , your rooms are on the second floor , " she replied , " and you can lock them all up tight  --  possibly you 'll get air enough from the patio . The nights are always cool , you know , but I 'd feel stuffy with all the shutters closed . " " We 'll see , " was all he said , but there was something about the way he said it that she did not like . In fact , Diana Benders was sure that she was not going to like Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supper an hour later Lillian Manill looked inquiringly at her cousin . " Where is Mr. Colby ? " she asked . " Over at the cook-house eating his supper , I suppose , " replied Diana . " Do n't he eat with us ? He seems such a nice fellow . " " He is a nice fellow , " replied Diana , " but the boys would rather eat by themselves . Women folks would take away their appetites . You have no idea how we terrify some of them . " " But Mr. Colby seemed very much at ease , " insisted Lillian . " Hal is different , but the very fact that he is foreman makes it necessary for him to eat with the other men  --  it is customary . "  | " Mr. Bull seemed at ease too , after I got him started , " continued Lillian . " He is n't much of a talker , but he did n't seem a bit afraid of me . " " Bull is not afraid of anything , " Diana assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all you must exercise a wonderful power over men . I can scarcely ever get a dozen words out of him . " " Well , I guess I 've got a way with men , " said Lillian , complacently . " I 'm afraid that you will find that Bull is not very susceptible , " said Diana , with just the vaguest hint of tartness . " Oh , I do n't know , " replied the other ; " he has promised to teach me to ride and shoot . " Diana ate in silence for several minutes . She was wondering already if she were going to like her cousin . But then , of course she was  --  how silly of her to think she was not , she concluded . " I met an old friend on the stage today , " remarked Corson , presently . Diana raised her eyebrows politely . " How nice , " she said . " Yes , it was . Have n't seen him for a couple of years . Nice chap , Jefferson Wainright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but I used to see him when I 'd go down to Cambridge for the games . His governor 's a nice old chap , too , and got a wad of the long green . " " So he has told us , " said Diana . " Oh , you know them ? They did n't mention it "  | " I have met them . Mr. Wainright tried to buy the ranch . " " Oh , yes , I believe he did mention something of the kind . Why did n't you sell it to him ? " " His offer was too low , for one reason , and the other is that I do not care to sell my interest . " Corson and Miss Manill exchanged a quick glance that escaped Diana . " How much did he offer you ? " asked Corson . " Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . " " Why , that seems a very fair price , " said Corson . " It is ridiculous , Mr. Corson , " replied Diana , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business you know it as well as I. " " I am very familiar with it , " replied the New Yorker . " In fact , from your remarks I imagine that I am much more familiar with it than you . " " Then you know that the cattle interests alone are worth three times that amount , without considering the mine at all . " Corson shook his head . " I am afraid that way out here you are too far from the financial center of the country to have a very comprehensive grasp of values . Now , as a matter of fact , the bottom has dropped out of the live-stock market . We 'll be lucky if we make expenses for the next year or so , and it probably never will come back to what it was . And as for the mine , that , of course , is about done . It wo n't pay to work it a year from now . If we could get two hundred and fifty thousand  | dollars for this business we 'd be mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that offer ? he 's too shrewd a business man . " Diana Henders made no reply . She was wondering just how much Maurice B. Corson did know about the live-stock market and the mine . She was inclined to believe that he knew a great deal more than his remarks concerning them would indicate . At the same hour Mary Donovan 's boarders were gathered about her table . She had other guests this evening in addition to her regular clientele . There were the Wainrights , and Bull was there for supper and breakfast as was usual when the bullion came down from the mine . It was not a gay company . Mack Harber and Jim Weller looked with suspicion on Bull , an attitude that would have blossomed into open and active hostility could they have gained the support of Gum Smith ; but Gum was not searching for trouble . He glowered at his plate and hated Bull . Wildcat Bob inhaled soup and hated Gum Smith . The Wainrights scarcely raised their eyes from the business of eating for fear of the embarrassment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wainright off the Bar Y Ranch  --  an occurrence which rankled horribly in the breasts of both . Bull , taciturn as usual , ate in silence with something of the mien of a lion feeding among jackals . Mary Donovan hovered in the doorway . Bull laid down  | his spoon , drank a glass of water and rose from the table . " Sure an ' wo n't ye have another helpin ' o ' puddin' ' now , Bull ? " urged Mary . " No , thanks , Mrs. Donovan , " he replied , " I 'm plumb full . " He walked past her into the kitchen and out the back door . An almost audible sigh of relief rose from the remaining guests . " I reckon he thinks he owns the shack , " commented Jim Weller apropos of Bull 's exit through the sacred precincts of Mary Donovan 's kitchen . " Sure , he could have it fer the askin ' , the fine b'y he is , " shot back Mary . " Him a-goin ' out to fetch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Weller , what ai n't fit to black his boots , sits here and makes re-marks about him , ye lazy whelp ! " Mr. Weller subsided . The meal over , the guests departed with the exception of Mack Harber , Jim Weller , and the Wainrights who had congregated on the veranda . " You do n't seem to like the fellow they call Bull , " remarked the younger Wainright to Weller . " I did n't say I did n't like him an ' I did n't say I did , " replied Weller , noncommittally . " Well , I do n't like him , " said Mack , vehemently . " I would n't like my grandmother if she shot me in the belly . " " You mean that he shot you ? " asked Wainright . " The Black Coyote shot me , an ' if Bull ai n't The Black Coyote my name 's McGinnis. "  | " You really think that he has been pulling off these holdups ? " demanded the elder Wainright . " I ai n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every one , ' most , thinks so , an ' of we had a decent sheriff that feller 'd be behind the bars where he belongs , er strung up to a cottonwood in Hell 's Bend . ' Pears to me like Gum was either in on the deal er afeared of Bull . " " Gum 's afeared of every one , " said Weller . " Well , " remarked Jefferson Wainright , Sr. , " when we come over on this side o ' the hills I calc'late as how things air goin ' to be a heap sight different . There wo n't be no more o ' this here funny gunplay stuff . I 'm a-goin ' to run all o ' these would-be bad men out o ' the country . " " You figgerin ' on comin ' over here ? " asked Mack . " I certainly am . I 'm a-goin ' to buy the whole Bar Y out-fit . " " The Hell you is ! " exclaimed Mack . " I heard that Miss Di would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothin ' to say about it . I 'm a-goin ' to buy it from the man that 's runnin ' that outfit now , an ' he 's a mighty good business man , too . " " Who 's that  --  Colby ? " " No , Colby nothin ' ? it 's Mr. Corson of Noo York . He 's handlin ' all o ' John Manill 's interests an ' he just come here today with Manill 's daughter . We come over on the stage with them . I was tellin ' Corson of the fine airs that chit of a Henders  | girl puts on , but things is goin ' to be different now . Corson 's goin ' to close out the estate an ' the holdin 's here is as good as sold to me already . "  | CHAPTER X WILDCAT BOB GOES COURTING BULL sat in a corner of The Chicago Saloon watching the play at the faro table . It was too early to go to bed and he was not a man who read much , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , which there was not . He had skimmed the latest Eastern papers that had come in on the stage and his reading was over until the next shipment of gold from the mine brought him again into contact with a newspaper . Then we would read the live-stock market reports , glance over the headlines and throw the paper aside , satisfied . His literary requirements were few . A man who had drunk not wisely but too well lurched up to him . " Have a drink , stranger ! " he commanded . It was not an invitation . " Ai n't drinkin ' , " replied Bull , quietly . " Oh , yes , you be , " announced the hospitable one . " When I says drink , you drinks , see ? I 'm a bad man , I am . Whoopee ! " and drawing a six-shooter he commenced firing into the floor at Bull 's feet . Suddenly a large man enveloped him from the rear , held his gun hand aloft and dragged him away into an opposite corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lurid profanity , he counselled him to greater discretion . " Why you blankety , blank , blank , blank ! " he cried . " You tryin ' to commit sewerside ? Do n't you know who that is , you blitherin ' idjit ? " then he whispered something in the other 's ear . The effect was electrical . The man seemed sobered instantly . With staring eyes he looked across the room at Bull . " I 'm goin ' to git out o ' here , " he said , " he might change his mind . " " 1 cai n't see yit why he did n't bore ye , " agreed his friend . " You better go an ' apologize . " Slowly the pseudo bad man crossed the room toward Bull , who had not moved sufficiently to have changed his position since the man had first accosted him . The man halted in front of Bull , a sickly grin on his bloated countenance . " No offense , pardner . Jest had a drop too much . No offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest jokin ' . " Bull eyed him intently for a moment . " Oh , yes , " he said presently , " I remember you now  --  you 're the flannel mouth what got gay with of Wildcat a coupla months ago . Did you ever return that window sash you took with you ? I hearn Gum was powerful cut up about that window sash . " Not the shadow of a smile crossed Bull 's face . " I war n't there , but I hearn all about it . " The other flushed , attempted some witty repartee  | that fell flat , and finally managed to make his escape amid a roar of laughter from the nearer card players and spectators who had overheard the brief dialogue . Bull rose . " Goin ' ? " asked an acquaintance . " I reckon so . Good night . " " Good night , Bull . " The man stepped out into the clear , star-lit night . Involuntarily he turned and looked toward the northeast in the direction of the Bar Y ranch . Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing out across the arid , moon-bathed level that stretched away to her loved feet . What emotions played behind the inscrutable mask of his face ? Who may say ? As he stood there silently he heard voices coming from between The Chicago Saloon and Gum 's Place ? Liquors and Cigars . " He 's in there now , " said one . " I kin see him . If there were n't so tarnation many fellers at the bar I c 'd git him from here . " " You better come along afore you git in more trouble than you got the capacity to handle , " urged a second voice . " Thas all right . I know what I 'm doin ' . There cai n't no dried up of buffalo chip like thet run me out o ' no man 's saloon an ' get away with it , an ' thas all they is to thet . " " Well , I 'm goin ' home , " stated the second voice . " I know when I 'm well off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears offen this Wildcat Bob party I 'm comin ' home , too . " " You go to shootin ' any ears offen Wildcat Bob an ' you wo n't need no blankets where you 're goin ' . " " Thas-so ? Well , here goes  --  you better stay an ' see the fun . " " I 'm goin ' now while I got the chance , " said the other , and Bull heard him coming from the side of the building . The former stepped quickly back into the doorway of The Chicago Saloon and an instant later he saw the large man who had dragged his friend from him a few minutes before pass up the street at a rapid walk . Then Bull looked from his place of concealment , just in time to see another figure emerge from between the buildings and enter Gum 's Place . Bull was close behind him . The door was open a crack . He saw that the other had advanced into the room a few feet and was standing behind one of the rough columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the far end , Wildcat Bob had just set down his whiskey glass upon the bar , wiped his beard on his sleeve , and turned away toward the tables where the gambling was in progress . For a moment he would be alone , with only the rough rear wall behind him . Bull saw the stranger raise his six-gun to take deliberate aim . He was too far away to reach him before he pulled the trigger and it would do no good to warn the Wildcat . There was but a single alter-  | native to standing supinely by and watching old Wildcat being shot down in cold blood by a cowardly murderer . It was this alternative that Bull adopted . As the smoke rose from the muzzle of his gun the stranger threw his hands above his head , his weapon clattered to the floor , and he wheeled about . His eyes alighted upon Bull standing there , grim faced and silent , the smoking six-gun in his hand . Suddenly the wounded man gave voice to a shrill scream . " He done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He done it ! The Black Coyote done it ! He 's killed me ! " and with these last words the body slumped to the floor . Bull stood facing them all in silence for just a moment . The whole room full of men and women were staring at him . Then he slipped his gun into its holster and advanced into the room , a faint smile on his lips . He walked toward Wildcat Bob . " That hombre was after you , Bob , " he said . " He was drunk , but I could n't stop him no other way . He 's the feller you chased through the window that time . " Gum Smith hurried to the rear of the bar . Then he leaned over it and pointed a finger at Bull . " Yoall 's undah arrest ! " he cried . " Yo-all 's undah arrest fo murder . " " Go kick yourself through a knot-hole ! " advised Bull . " Ef I had n't got that hombre he 'd a-got Bob . They was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearn what he called him , did n't yo ? " yelled Gum . He pointed at first one and then another . " Ah depatize yo ! Ah depatize yo ! " he cried . " Arrest him , men ! " No one moved , except Wildcat Bob . He came and stood beside Bull , and he drew both his long , heavy guns with their heavily notched grips . " Any one what 's aimin ' to take this boy , why , let him step up , " said Wildcat Bob , and his watery blue eye was fixed terribly upon the sheriff . " Ah want yo-all to know thet when Ah depatizes yo , yo-all 's depatized , " shrilled Gum . " Yo hearn what the corpse called him . Ai n't that enough ? Do yo duty , men ! " One or two of the men , friends of Gum 's , moved restlessly . Bull , sensing trouble , had drawn both his weapons , and now he stood beside the Wildcat , his steady gray eyes alert for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gents go fer to start nothin ' , " he advised . " You all seen what happened . You know I could n't a-done nothin ' else , an ' as fer what thet drunken bum called me ef Gum thinks I 'm The Coyote why do n't he step up an ' take me ? I ai n't a honin ' fer trouble , but I do n't aim to be the subject o ' no postmortem neither . " " Do yo-all surrendah , then ? " demanded Gum . " Do n't try to be no more of a damn fool than the Lord made yuh , Gum , " advised Wildcat Bob . " You know thet if this here boy ai n't The Black Coyote you do n't want him , an ' ef he is The Black  | Coyote you would n't never git outen behind thet bar of you was to try to take him . Fer my part I do n't believe he is , an ' I got two of pea-shooters here what thinks the same as I does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the sheriff after a moment 's deliberation , " Ah reckon as mebby the corpse was mistook . Hev a drink on the house , gents ! " As Bull and Wildcat Bob entered the office of The Donovan House Mary Donovan espied them through the open doorway of her sitting room and called to them . " Come in an ' have a drop o ' tay wid me before yese go to bed , " she invited , and as they entered she scrutinized Wildcat Bob with a stern eye . Evidently satisfied , her face softened . " I know they ai n't run out o ' whiskey in Hendersville , " she said , " so I reckon ye must o ' run out o ' money , Wildcat . " The little old gentleman reached into his pocket and drew forth a handful of silver , which he displayed with virtuous satisfaction . " The saints be praised ! " exclaimed Mary Donovan . " Ye 've money in yer pocket an ' yer home airly an ' sober ! Be ye sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary  --  I ai n't never goin ' to tech another drop , " he assured her , solemnly . " Ye 've not had a drink the avenin ' ? " she demanded .  | " Well ? " he hesitated , " you see " Yis , I see , " she snapped , scornfully . " But , Mary , I only had one little one  --  you would n't begrudge an old man one little nightcap ? " " Well , " she consented , relenting , " wan little one would n't do no harrm . I would n't moind one mesilf . " Wildcat Bob reached for his hip pocket . " I was thinking that same thing , Mary , and that 's why I brung one home fer yuh , " and he drew forth a pint flask . " The divil fly away wid ye , Wildcat Bob ! " she cried , but she was smiling as she reached for the flask . Bull rose , laughing . " Good night ! " he said , " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ye go , " invited Mary . " No thanks , I 've quit , " replied Bull . A moment later they heard him mounting the stairs to his room . " He 's a good b'y , " said Mary , wiping her lips and replacing the cork in the bottle . " He is that , Mary , " agreed Wildcat , reaching for it . There was a period of contented silence . " It 's a lonesome life fer a widdy-lady , that it is , " remarked Mary , with a deep sigh . Wildcat Bob moved his chair closer , flushed at his own boldness , and fell to examining the toe of  | his boot . Mary rocked diligently , her red hands folded in her ample lap , keeping an eye cocked on the Wildcat . There was another long silence that was broken at last by Mrs. Donovan . " Sure , " she said , " an ' it 's funny ye never married , Bob . " Bob essayed reply , but a mouthful of tobacco juice prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that room , opened the front door and spat copiously without . Returning to the room he hitched his chair closer to Mary 's , apparently by accident , as he resumed his seat . " I ? " he started , but it was evidently a false start , since he commenced all over again . " I ? " again he paused . " You what ? " inquired Mary Donovan with soft encouragement . " You ? " said Wildcat Bob and stuck again . Inward excitement evidently stimulated his salivary glands , with the result that he was again forced to cross to the outer door . When he returned he I I hunched his chair a bit closer to Mary 's . " As ye was about to remark , " prodded Mary . " I  --  I " " Yes , " said Mary , " Go on , Bob ! " " I was just a-goin ' to say that I do n't think it 'll rain tonight , " he ended , lamely . Mary Donovan placed her hands upon her hips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scorn upon Wildcat Bob  --  all  | of which were lost upon him , he having again returned to whole-souled consideration of the toe of his boot , his face suffused with purple . " Rain ! " muttered Mary Donovan . " Rain in Arizony this time o ' year ? Sure , an ' ye mane ye thought it would n't shnow , did n't ye ? " she demanded . Wildcat Bob emitted only a gurgle , and again silence reigned , unbroken for long minutes , except by the creaking of Mary 's rocker . Suddenly she turned upon him . " Gim me that flask , " she said . He handed it over and she took a long drink . Wiping the mouth of the bottle with the palm of her hand she returned it to him . Then Wildcat Bob took a drink , and the silence continued . The evening wore on , the flask was emptied and midnight came . With it came Gum Smith , reeling bedward . They watched him stagger across the office floor and heard him stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to bed wid ye , " she said . " I ca n't be sittin ' here all night gossipin ' wid ye . " He , too , arose . " Good night , Mary , " he said , " it 's been a pleasant evenin ' . " " Yis , " said Mary Donovan . As Wildcat Bob climbed the stairs toward his room he was mumbling in his beard . " Doggone my hide ! " he said . " Ef I 'd jest had a coupla drinks I mout a-done it . "  | " Sure , " soliloquized Mary Donovan , as she closed the door of her bedroom , " it 's not so dum funny after all that the ould fool nivir was married . "  | CHAPTER XI " RIDE HIM , COWBOY ! " LILLIAN MANILL awoke early and viewed the brilliant light of the new day through the patio windows of her room  --  the outer windows were securely shuttered against Indians . She stretched languorously and turned over for another nap , but suddenly she changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hideously early hour for Lillian Manill to arise ; but she had recalled that there was to be a riding lesson after breakfast and Diana had explained to her that the breakfast hour was an early one . Dressing , she selected a tailored walking suit  --  she would change into her riding habit after breakfast ? for she wanted to stroll about the yard a bit before breakfast , and she knew that this new walking suit was extremely fetching . A few minutes later as she stepped into the yard she saw signs of activity in the direction of the horse corrals and thither she bent her steps . Texas Pete , who was helping the chore boy with the morning feeding , saw her coming and looked for an avenue of escape , being in no sense a lady 's man and fully aware of the fact ; but he was too late ? there was no avenue left , Lillian Manill being already between him and the bunk-house . So he  | applied himself vigorously to the pitch fork he was wielding and pretended not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever upon Lillian Manill . She paused outside the bars and looked in . " Good morning ! " she said . Texas Pete pretended that he had not heard . " Good morning ! " she repeated in a louder voice . " Mornin ' , " replied Pete , pulling at the brim of his hat and immediately resuming the fork . He wished she would move on . The horses were fed and there was no other excuse for him to remain in the corral , but in order to reach the bunk-house he must pass directly by this disconcerting person . Diana he did not mind  --  he was used to Diana , and aside from the fact that he was madly in love with her she caused him little embarrassment or concern except upon those few occasions when he had attempted to maintain an extended conversation with her . Dr. Johnson would have found nothing in Pete 's conversational attainments to have aroused his envy . Pete continued feeding the horses . He fed them twice as much as they could eat in a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fed again that evening ; but finally he realized that he could defer the embarrassing moment no longer and that the girl had not left . He stuck the fork viciously into the hay stack and crossed the corral . He tried to appear unconcerned and to pass her by without looking at her , but  | in both he failed  --  first because he was very much concerned and second because she placed herself directly in his path and smiled sweetly at him . " I do n't believe I had the pleasure of meeting you last night , " she said . " I am Miss Manill ? Miss Henders ' cousin . " " Yes 'm , " said Pete . " And I suppose you are one of the cow-gentlemen , " she added . Pete turned suddenly and violently purple . A choking sound issued from his throat ; but quickly he gained control of himself . Something in that remark of hers removed instantly all of Texas Pete 's embarrassment . He found himself at once upon an even footing with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hai n't one o ' the cow-gentlemen  --  I 'm on'y a tendershoe . " " I 'm sure you do n't look it , " she told him , " with those leather trousers with the fleece on . But you ride , do n't you ? " she added quickly . " I ai n't larned yit , " he assured her . " Oh , is n't that too bad ! I thought of course you were a wonderful equestrian and I was going to ask you to teach me to ride ; but you 'd better come along after breakfast and we 'll get Mr. Colby to teach us both . " " I reckon he would n't like it , " explained Pete . " You see I 'm in his afternoon ridin ' class . He do n't take nothin ' but ladies in the mornin ' . " " Oh , does he teach riding regularly ? "  | " My , yes , that 's what he 's here fer . He 's larnin ' us all to ride so 's we kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stid o ' havin ' to hoof-it . " " I thought he was foreman , " she said . " Yes 'm , but that 's one of his jobs  --  larnin ' cowgentlemen to ride . " " How interesting ! I 've learned so much already and I 've only been in Arizona since day before yesterday . Mr. Bull was so kind and patient , answering all my silly little questions . " " I reckon Bull could answer most any question , " he told her . " Yes , indeed ; but then he 's been here in Arizona so long , and had so much to do with the development of the country . Why , do you know he planted all the willows along that funny little river we followed for so long yesterday  --  miles and miles of them ? " " Did he tell you that ? " inquired Texas Pete . " Yes , is n't it wonderful ? I think it shows such an artistic temperament . " " There 's more to Bull than I ever suspected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamorous , metallic din shattered the quiet of the cool Arizona morning . The girl gave a little scream and sprang for Texas Pete , throwing both arms about his neck . " O-o-h ! " she cried ; " what is it ? Indians ? " " No 'm , " said Pete , striving to disengage himself , for he saw the malevolent eyes of several un-  | holy cow-gentlemen gloating upon the scene from the doorway of the bunk-house . " No 'm , that ai n't Injuns  --  that 's the breakfast bell . " " How silly of me ! " she explained . " Now I suppose I must be going . I 'm so glad to have met you , Mr. " " My name 's Texas Pete could have some lovely excursions , picnicking among the beautiful hills . Oh , would n't it be divine ? just you and I , Mr. Pete ? " and she let her great , lovely eyes hang for a moment on his in a fashion that had turned more sophisticated heads than Texas Pete 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward the cook-house he ran his fingers through his shock of hair . " By gollies ! " he mut tered . " The outside o ' her head 's all right , anyway . " As he entered the cook-house Shorty seized him and threw both arms about his neck . " Kiss me darlin ' ! " he cried . " I ai n't had a single kiss before breakfast . " " Shet up , you long-legged walrus , " replied Pete , grinning , as he shoved the other aside . He ate in silence despite the gibes of his companions , who quickly desisted , realizing the futility of attempting to arouse Texas Pete 's ire by raillery . He was quick enough of temper and quicker still with his guns when occasion warranted ; but no one  | could arouse his anger so long as their thrusts were shod with fun . " Lookee here , cook , " he called promptly to that individual ; " you 're the best eddicated bloke in this bunch o ' long-horns  --  what 's a questreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the cook . Texas Pete scratched his head . " I thought all along that I did n't like her , " he muttered , " an ' now I knows it . " Diana Henders greeted her guests with a cheery smile and a word of welcome as they entered the dining room for breakfast . " I hope you slept well , " she said . " Oh , I did , " exclaimed Lillian Manill . " I never knew a thing from the time my head touched the pillow until broad daylight this morning . I had a perfectly wonderful night . " " I did n't , " said Corson , and Diana noticed then that he looked tired and haggard . " What happened last night ? " he asked . " Why , nothing , that I know of , " replied Diana . " Why do you ask ? " " Have you seen any of your men this morning ? or any of the neighbors ? " he continued . " I have seen a couple of the men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How many women are there on the place ? " he went on . " Just Lillian and I. "  | " Well , something terrible happened last night , " said Corson . " I never spent such a hideous night in my life . It 's funny you did n't hear it . " " Hear what ? " asked Diana . " That woman  --  my God ! I can hear her screams yet . " " Oh , Maurice ! what do you mean ? " cried Miss Manill . " It was about midnight , " he explained . " I had been rather restless  --  just dozing a little  --  when all of a sudden the dogs commenced to bark and then a woman screamed  --  it was the most awful , long-drawn , agonized wail I ever heard  --  some one must have been torturing her . I 'll bet the Indians were out last night and the first thing you know you 'll hear about a terrible massacre . Well , it stopped all of a sudden and pretty soon the dogs commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em  --  and then that woman shrieked again ? I 'll hear that to my dying day . I do n't think you ought to let any of the men go away today until you find out just what happened last night . The Indians may just be waiting for ' em to go and then they 'll rush down on us and kill us all . " A faint smile had slowly curved Diana 's lips and brought little wrinkles to the corners of her eyes . " What you smiling about , Miss Benders ? " demanded Corson . " If you 'd have heard that woman you would n't feel like smiling  --  not for a long time . "  | " That was n't a woman you heard , Mr. Corson ? they were coyotes . " He looked at her blankly . " Are you sure ? " he asked , presently . " Of course I 'm sure , " she told him . Corson breathed a sigh of relief . " I 'd like to believe it , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can believe it , for that is what you heard . " " I 'd hate to be caught out after dark by ' em , " he said . " A pack of fifty or a hundred such as there was last night would tear a fellow to pieces in no time . " " They are perfectly harmless , " Diana assured him , " and the chances are that there were no more than two or three of them  --  possibly only one . " " I guess I heard ' em , " he insisted . " They have a way of sounding like a whole lot more than they really are . " He shook his head . " I guess I know what I heard . " " I 'll have to show that cook of yours how to make coffee , " remarked Corson a few minutes later . Diana flushed . " I suppose we do n't get the best coffee out here , " she said , " but we are accustomed to it and learn to like it first rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has to do with . " " Well , it wo n't hurt him any to learn how to make coffee , " said Corson . " He has been with us a great many years and is  | very faithful . I think he would be terribly hurt if a stranger criticised his coffee , " said Diana . " Maurice is very particular about his food , " said Miss Manill . " It is really an education to hear him order a dinner at Delmonico 's , and the way he does flay the waiters if everything is n't just so . I always get such a thrill  --  you can see people at the nearby tables listening to him , and whispering to one another . " " I can imagine , " said Diana , sweetly , but she did not say just what she could imagine . Corson swelled visibly . " Call the Chink in , Miss Henders , " he said , " and I 'll give him a lesson now ? you might learn something yourself . Way out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get much chance , of course . There 's really nothing quite like the refining influences of the East to take the rough edges off of people . " " I think I prefer to speak to Wong privately and in person , if I find it necessary , " said Diana . " Well , just so I get some decent coffee hereafter , " said Corson , magnanimously . Lillian Manill , having finished her breakfast , rose from the table . " I 'm going to put on my riding habit now , Maurice , " she said . " Go out and tell Mr. Colby to wait for me . " Diana Renders bit her lip , but said nothing as Corson rose and walked toward the door . He was garbed in a New York tailor 's idea of the latest  | English riding mode , and again Diana bit her lip , but not in anger . Corson , setting his hat jauntily over one eye , stalked into the open and down toward the corrals where the men were saddling up for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puffed contentedly . As he hove in sight work in the corral ceased spontaneously . " My Gawd ! " moaned Texas Pete . " Who left the bars down ? " inquired Idaho . " Shut up , " cautioned Colby . " That feller 's likely to be boss around here . " " He wo n't never boss me , " said Shorty , " not with thet funny hat on . I wonder could I crease it , " and he reached for his gun . " Do n't git funny , Shorty . They 's friends o ' Miss Renders , " whispered Colby . " It 'd only make her feel bad . " He could not have hit upon a stronger appeal to these men . Shorty lowered his hand from the butt of his gun and almost at once work was resumed . When Corson joined them he could not have guessed that he was the object either of ridicule or pity , though he was  --  of both . " Say , Colby , " he said . " Saddle up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wait around until she comes out . I want you to give her a few lessons in riding . " " Did Miss Renders say that it would be all right ? " he asked . " You know the work is pretty  | well laid out an ' we ai n't got none too many hands . " " Oh , that 's all right , my man , " Corson assured him . " You 'll be safe to do anything that I say . I 'm handling Miss Manill 's interests and looking after everything in general until the estate is closed . Just trot along and saddle up a couple of horses , and see to it that they 're gentle . I have n't ridden for a number of years , although I was pretty good at it when I was a boy . " Hal Colby eyed Mr. Maurice B. Corson for a long minute . What was transpiring in his mind it would have been difficult to guess from the expression on his face ; though what should have been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full well , and so they lolled around , their faces immobile , waiting for the fun to begin , but they were doomed to disappointment , for there was no gunplay  --  Colby , they thought , might have at least " made the dude dance . " Instead he turned away without a word to Corson , gave some final directions for the day 's work , swung into the saddle and rode toward the office , utterly ignoring the Easterner 's instructions . Corson flushed angrily . " Here you , one of you men , " he snapped , turning toward the punchers , most of whom had already mounted their ponies , " I want two horses saddled immediately  --  one for Miss Manill and one for me . " Silently , ignoring him as completely as though he had not existed , the riders filed out of the corral  | past him . At a little distance they drew rein , waiting for Colby . " I 've saw gall before , " remarked Texas Pete in an undertone , " but thet there dude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he do n't c'ral thet jaw o ' his pronto , " growled Shorty , " I ai n't a-goin ' to be responsible fer what happens ? I cai n't hold myself much longer . " " I would n't a-took what Colby did , " said Idaho . " Some blokes 'll take a lot to hold their jobs , " said Shorty . " They c'n hev mine right now , " stated Texas Pete , " ef I got ta take thet dude 's lip . " " Here comes the boss now , " said Idaho . " She 'll settle things , durn her pretty little hide , " he added affectionately . Diana had stopped just below the house to listen to Colby , whom the men could see was talking earnestly to her . " Look here , Di , " he was saying , " I want to know ef I got ta take orders from thet tin-horn lawyer feller . Is he boss round these diggin 's , or is you ? " " Why , I supposed I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit that there appears to be a suspicion of doubt on the subject in Mr. Corson 's mind . What has he said to you ? " Colby told her , repeating Corson 's words as nearly as he could , and the girl could not suppress a laugh .  | " Oh , I reckon it 's funny , all right , " he said , testily , " but I do n't see the joke  --  hevin ' a papercollared cracker-fed dude like that-un callin ' me ' my man ' an ' orderin ' me to saddle up a hoss fer him , right in front o ' . all the boys . Trot along , ' he says , an ' saddle up a couple o ' hosses , an ' see to it thet they 're plumb gentle . ' My Gawd , Di ! you do n't expect me to take thet sort o ' jaw , do you ? " Diana , by this time , was frankly in tears from laughter , and finally Colby himself was unable to longer repress a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , finally . " He is just one of those arrogant , conceited , provincial New Yorkers . They are mighty narrow and disagreeable , but we 've got to put up with him for a short time and we might as well make the best of it . Go and ask Willie to saddle up two horses for them , and be sure that the one for Miss Manill is plumb gentle . " She accompanied her last instructions with the faintest trace of a wink . Colby wheeled his pony and loped off to the corral , where he imparted the boss 's orders to the chore boy , Willie , lank , raw-boned and pimply . Willie , who always thought of himself as Wild Bill , swaggered off to catch up the two ponies , grinning inwardly as he roped Gimlet for Mr. Maurice B. Corson . Corson , seeing Diana approaching , had gone to meet her . He was still red and angry . " Look here , Miss Renders , " he exclaimed .  | " You 've got to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle up a couple of horses and they absolutely ignored me . You tell them that when I give orders they are to be obeyed . " " I think it will be less confusing if the orders come from me , Mr. Corson , " she replied . " It is never well to have too many bosses , and then , you see , these men are peculiar . They are unlike the sort of men you have apparently been accustomed to dealing with . You can not talk to them as you would to a Delmonico waiter  --  unless you are tired of life , Mr. Corson . They are accustomed to me ? we are friends  --  and they will take orders from me without question , so I think that it will be better all around if you will explain your wants to me in the future . Colby told me what you wanted just now and the horses are being saddled . " He started to speak and then , evidently reconsidering , caught himself with a palpable effort . " Very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass this time . " Together they walked toward the corral where Willie was saddling a quiet , old horse for Miss Manill . Beside him stood Gimlet with drooping head and dejected mien . " Which one is for me , sonny ? " demanded Corson . Wild Bill glanced up in sullen scorn , eyed Mr. Corson for a brief moment and then jerked a soiled thumb in the direction of Gimlet.  | " What ! that old crow-bait ? " exclaimed the New Yorker . " You said you wanted a gentle hoss , " explained Colby , lolling in his saddle nearby , " an ' Gimlet wo n't pitch . " " I do n't want to ride a skate , " growled Corson . " When I 'm on a horse I want to know I 'm on something . " " You 'll know you 're on Gimlet , " Colby assured him , sweetly , " he ai n't so dumb as he looks . Jest stick your spurs into him an ' he 'll act quite lively . " " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurry ? I see Miss Manill coming now . " There were others who saw her coming , too . Texas Pete was only one of them . " By gollies ! " he exclaimed . " Look what 's got loose ! " Lillian Manill was approaching jauntily , clothed in a black riding habit , with a long , voluminous skirt , a man 's collar and tie and black silk hat , with a flowing veil wound around it . Shorty eyed her for a long minute , then he let his gaze wander to Mr. Corson . " It would n't never be safe fer me to go to New York , " he confided to Idaho . " I 'd shore laugh myself to death . " By the time Miss Manill joined the group the two horses were saddled and Willie had led them out of the corral . " Mercy ! " exclaimed Miss Manill . " Have n't  | you a side-saddle ? I could never ride one of those horrid things . " " I 'm sorry , " said Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is a side-saddle in the county . I think you can work it though , if you will put your leg around the horn . Next time I 'll fix you up with a skirt like mine and then you can ride astride . " " Are you sure the horse is perfectly safe ? " inquired Lillian . " I 'll have to have a few lessons before I can ride one of those bouncing ones . Oh , Mr. Colby , good morning ! Here I am all ready for my first lesson . " Her eyes took in the punchers grouped a few yards away . " I see you are going to have quite a class this morning . Mr. Pete told me , though , that you taught the cow-gentlemen in the afternoon . " Colby shot a quick glance at Pete , who had just been overcome by a violent fit of coughing , and knowing Texas Pete , as he did , grasped the situation at once . " Oh , I had to give up the afternoon class , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few like Mr. Pete who would n't never larn to ride . " " Is n't that too bad , " she said , politely . Then she turned toward Corson . " I think you 'd better try it first , Maurice . I 'll watch how you do it . " " All right , " said he . " It 's been a long time since I have ridden , but I guess it 'll come back to me quick enough . I might be able to give you a few pointers at that . "  | He walked up to Gimlet 's off side and took hold of the saddlehorn , neglecting the reins , which Willie still held . Gimlet eyed him sadly . When he essayed to place a foot in the stirrup the pony sidestepped rapidly in the opposite direction . " You 'd better mount from the other side , Mr. Corson , " advised Diana . " These horses are not broken to work with from the off side . " " I knew all along he was a damn Injun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins , you may need ' em , " supplemented Willie , who , at bottom , had a kind heart and shrank from bloodshed . Corson walked to the near side of Gimlet , gathered the reins loosely in his right hand , stuck a foot into the stirrup , took hold of the horn with both hands and pulled himself laboriously into the saddle . Gimlet stood quietly . " Giddap ! " said Mr. Corson , but Gimlet moved not . " Throw the hooks into him ! " shouted Willie , gleefully . " Why do n't the old skate go ? " demanded Corson , shaking the reins . " Use your spurs ! " called one of the cowboys . " That 's what you bought ' em fer , ai n't it ? " Mr. Corson used his spurs . The result was electrical , galvanizing Gimlet into instant and surprising action  --  action which glowingly elucidated the derivation of his name . He wheeled dizzily round  | and round upon the same spot , and with lightning rapidity . Mr. Corson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intervals that he was not clawing at the loose reins in a mad effort to gather them . Then Gimlet bolted . He ran for some hundred yards , stopped and commenced wheeling again . Mr. Corson lost a stirrup . Then he let go both reins and seized the horn with two hands . " Stop him ! " he yelled . " Stop him ! Whoa ! Whoa ! " " Rip him open ! " shrieked Willie . " Spur him in the eyes ! " " Ride him , cowboy ! " yelled Idaho . Again Gimlet bolted and this time Mr. Corson commenced to slip dangerously to one side . A hundred-yard sprint back to where he had started and Gimlet paused to wheel once more . It was the end . Mr. Corson spun off , alighting on his back . He rolled over with surprising agility and on hands and knees crawled rapidly away from this man eater that he was sure was pursuing him . But Gimlet was only standing dejectedly , with drooping ears . Corson came to his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer sensibilities of New Yorkers  --  were laughing rudely . " It was a put-up job , " he spluttered . " It was a put-up job . You 'll suffer for this , Colby ! You told me that animal was gentle . "  | " I told you he would n't pitch , mister ! " snapped Colby . " An ' he did n't pitch . " Miss Manill had started back toward the house . " I think I 'll not ride this morning , " she said .  | CHAPTER XII CORSON SPEAKS " COME here ! ' he yells then to the rest o ' us boys , Step up to the fun'ral an ' do n't make no noise The while we inter all the barb-wire what 's here , After which we 'll dispose o ' the seegars an ' beer . ' " sang Texas Pete . " Hello ! See whose came ! " Bull entered the bunk-house with a grin and a nod . " Still singin ' I see , Pete , " he said . " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slipped by since the arrival of Corson and Miss Manill . Bull had just been relieved from duty as bullion guard and was only now returning to the home ranch . In the weeks that he had brought the gold down from the mine there had been no holdup  --  The Black Coyote or Gregorio had not once been seen . " How 's everything ? " asked Bull . " So-so , " replied Texas Pete . " Where 's Colby ? I got ta report to him . " " Up at the house  --  he eats there now . " Bull made no comment . He thought he understood why Hal Colby ate at the house . One day soon , doubtless , he would sleep there , too , as master . " This Manill heifer got stuck on him an ' insists  | on his eatin ' there , " explained Pete . " Things ai n't ben the same since them two shorthorns hit the diggin 's . The boss she looks tired and worried all the time an ' sadlike . I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the rest o ' us . " " Is Colby gone on this Manill girl ? " asked Bull . " I du n no . Sometimes I reckons he is an ' sometimes I reckons he ai n't . Looks like as if he wer n't quite sure which side his bread was buttered on an ' he 's waitin ' to find out . " Bull busied himself arranging his blankets on his old bunk , working in silence . Texas Pete eyed him surreptitiously . There was a troubled look in Pete 's eyes . Presently he coughed nervously . The two men were alone in the bunk-house . " Say , Bull , " Pete finally broke the silence , " you an ' me 's ben good pals . " Bull looked up from the work of folding his tarpaulin . " Who said we ai n't ? " he inquired . " Nobody ai n't said we ai n't , " Pete assured him . " Then what 's eatin ' you ? " " It 's only just what everybody 's sayin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd orter know about it . " " What ? " " Thet you an ' The Black Coyote air the same feller . Not thet it makes any difference with me . I ai n't askin ' whether you air or whether you ai n't . I 'm just a-tellin ' you fer your own good . " Bull smiled one of his slow smiles . " If I was n't I 'd say so , would n't I ? " he asked .  | " I reckon you would . " " An ' if I was I 'd say I was n't , would n't I ? " " I reckon you would , " assented Pete . " Then what the hell 's the use o ' sayin ' anything ? " he demanded . " And ' specially when I do n't give a damn what they think . " Pete shook his head . " I du n no , " he said . Bull started for the doorway . " I 'm goin ' up to the house to report to Colby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't git her grubhooks on you , " cautioned Pete . In the office he found Diana Henders writing a letter . She looked up with a little start as she heard his voice . " Oh , Bull ! " she cried , " I 'm so glad you 're hack . " " Thanks , Miss . I come up to report to Colby , but I see he ai n't here . " " He 's in the living-room with Mr. Corson and Miss Manill , " she told him . " I reckon I 'll see him later then . " He started to leave . " Do n't go , Bull , " she said . " I want to talk with you . Please sit down . " He walked toward her and lowered himself into the big easy chair that had been her father 's . His movements were like those of a lion  --  silent , powerful and yet without stealth . For the first time in weeks the sense of loneliness that had constantly oppressed her vanished . Bull  | was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home after a long absence  --  that was why she was so glad to see him . Her heart forgot the thing that her reason had been practically convinced of ? that Bull was the bandit of Hell 's Bend  --  that it was Bull who had been robbing her father and her for months  --  that it was Bull who had shot Mack Harber . She only knew that she felt relief and safety when Bull was near . Nearly everyone feared him ? many hated him . Could they all be wrong ? Could she alone be right in believing in him ? ? as her heart did against the wise counseling of reason . " Yes , Miss ? " he said , interrogatively . " The Wainrights are trying to buy the ranch again , Bull , " she said , " and Mr. Corson seems to favor the idea . " " Do you want to sell ? " he asked . " No , I do not ; but the worst of it is the price they want to accept  --  two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle and mine . They are bringing all kinds of pressure to bear on me . Mr. Corson says I must either buy them out or agree to the sale . I have n't the cash to buy them out and they wo n't take my notes . " " Do n't sell , Miss , at that price , an ' do n't sell at all if you do n't want to  --  they ca n't force you to sell . " " But they make it so unpleasant for me , and  | Mr. Corson is always telling me that the bottom has fallen out of the live stock business and that the new vein in the mine does n't exist . " " The live stock business is all right , Miss . It was n't never better , an ' as fer the new vein that 's all right too . I was scratchin ' around a little bit myself while I was up there these past six weeks . The gold 's there all right . The trouble is you ai n't got the right man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharper . Did you know the Wainrights was up there often ? " " No ! really ? " " Yes , an ' that superintendent is thick as thieves with ' em . " " He has no business to permit them on the property . " " He does though , " said Bull , " but he raised thunder when he found I 'd been snootin ' around the workings . I do n't like that hombre , Miss . " " Everybody seems to be against me , Bull , and it 's so hard to know what to do , now that Dad 's gone . Mr. Corson and my cousin are nagging at me all the time to agree to sell . Sometimes I am almost determined to just to get rid of them . " " If you want to git rid o ' them , Miss , that 's easy , " said Bull . " All you got ta do is say so an ' I 'll run ' em off the ranch an ' outta the county . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had taken quite a fancy to my cousin , coming in on the stage , " said Diana .  | " The only rope she could ever have on me , Miss , is that she 's your cousin , " replied Bull , and she knew that he meant it . " If you want me to run ' em out of the country , say the word , an ' I 'll start ' em in ten minutes  --  an ' keep ' em on the jump , too . " " I 'm afraid that would n't do , Bull , " she said , smiling . " I do n't see why not , " he replied . Just then , Hal Colby entered the room . He nodded to Bull . " You back ? " Bull took no notice of a question so obviously foolish . " How long you ben , back ? " continued Colby . " ' Bout half an hour . " " Why did n't you report ? " Colby was vexed . The easy familiarity of Bull 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' chair , and in pleasant converse with Diana , galled him . " Ai n't you got eyes ? " inquired Bull . " Cai n't you see me sittin ' here reportin ' to my boss ? " " You 're supposed to report to me , " snapped Colby . " I 'm apt to do lots of things I ai n't supposed to do , " Bull told him , softly . " I reckon most everybody knows that , too , " ' said Colby , meaningly . " Come ! " cried Diana . " Do n't you boys quarrel I have troubles enough now . Bull was looking  | for you , to report , when he came up here , " she told Colby . " He asked for you . " " Why did n't he say so , then ? I got some work for him an ' I ben expectin ' him all day . " " Well , I 'm here , " said Bull . " What do you want me to do ? " His voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he felt any . " Cramer wants off a few days an ' I want you to go over to the West Ranch an ' look after the hosses ' til he comes back . They 's some colts over there that needs to be rid  --  Cramer 'll tell you all they is to do . " " When do you want me to go ? " " Tonight  --  that 'll give Cramer a chance to git an early start in the mornin ' . " " All right , " said Bull , rising . " Good night , Miss . " " Good night , Bull . I may ride over while you 're at the West Ranch . I 've been intending to look the place over for a month or more . Cramer said we needed some new corrals . " He nodded and left the room . " I do n't see how you kin be decent to a feller what 's ben robbin ' you an ' your dad fer months , " said Colby , after Bull had left . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know it looks suspicious , Hal ; but it 's so hard to believe it of Bull . I hate to believe it . I almost do n't believe it . You are hard on him because you do n't like him "  | " Did n't I tell you he was one of my best friends ? you know that  --  till I got wise to his game . I ai n't a-wantin ' no rattle snake like thet as no friend o ' mine . " Diana sighed and rose wearily from her chair . " I 'm going up to wash for supper , " she said . She had been gone but a moment when Corson entered the office . " Well , " he asked , " has she changed her mind ? " " I did n't say nothing about the matter to her , " replied Colby . " It would n't have done no good after what I hearn Bull a-tellin ' her just afore I come in the room . " " What was that ? " demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell , an ' furthermore he offers to run you an ' Miss Manill outta the country if she gives the word . " " What did she say to that ? " Corson 's voice showed indications of nervousness . " Oh , she would n't stand fer that , o ' course ; but he 's a dangerous feller to have around her . He 's got too damn much influence over her . " " I wish we could get rid of him , " said Corson . " It seems funny that he is n't arrested , when everyone knows he 's The Black Coyote . " " He 'll run his neck into a noose one o ' these days , " replied Colby . " But in the meantime he may spoil this deal with Wainright , " said Corson , " and I 've got my heart set on that . I want to get out of this damned  | country . It gives me the willies . Too many Indians , and coyotes , and irresponsible kids with fire arms  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are so anxious to sell now , " said Colby . " You can get more if you half try . " " That would mean going back to New York . There is n't any capital out here . Wainright is a find , pure and simple . I ca n't chance taking the time to arrange a deal back East ? I do n't know what Miss Henders would be up to out here . What Miss Manill wants to do is get some ready money out of it quick and get out . I guess there 's only one thing to do and that 's to spring my last card on the girl . I 'd rather have done it an easier way , but she 's so damn stubborn she 's forcing me to it . " " To what ? " asked Colby . Corson leaned close to him and whispered for several minutes into his ear . When he was through Colby leaned back in his chair and whistled . " You do n't mean it ! " he exclaimed . " Wainright is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get this matter settled with the Henders girl so that I can have something definite to say to him . I think she 's coming around all right now that she is commencing to realize that the mine 's about played out and that the cattle business is n't much better . Of course it do n't make much difference what she thinks  | about it except that she could make it mighty unpleasant around here if she wanted to . " " She shore could make it unpleasant fer you and Wainright of she wanted to , " agreed Colby , " an do n't fool yourself that she thinks the business ai n't worth nothin ' . Ef you had her thinkin ' so today , Bull 's give her something new to think about since he was here . " " Hows that ? " demanded Corson . " I hearn him tellin ' her he 'd ben diggin ' ' round in the mine while he was up there an ' that he knows the new vein 's rich as all get-out , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I reckon she 'll believe him afore she will you . " Corson bit his lip . " That settles it ! " he exclaimed . " I 've fooled around long enough . I 'm going to tell her tonight . " Outside the bunk-house some of the men were washing for supper . Inside , Bull was rolling and roping his bed preparatory to moving to the West Ranch after the evening meal . " What yuh doin ' ? " demanded Texas Pete . " Yuh ai n't quit ? " " Goin ' over to the West Ranch  --  Cramer 's gettin ' off fer a spell , " explained Bull . " Looks like they were n't crazy fer your company here , " remarked Pete . Bull shrugged his shoulders and went on with the business of half-hitches , to the final knot , after which he tossed the bed-roll onto his bunk .  | " I should n't think you 'd stay on , Bull , " said Texas Pete . " Let 's pull our freight . I ai n't never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " I got my own reasons fer stayin ' on a spell yet , Pete , " he said . Pete said nothing more on the subject . Bull 's answer to his suggestion that they leave the country troubled him , however . It was not Diana Henders who was keeping Bull , of that Pete was certain , because Hal Colby had long since as much as admitted that he , Colby , was engaged to marry the dainty boss . It was n't because of any love he had for the job , either  --  Texas Pete knew that ? for Colby had never made Bull 's job any too easy since the former had become foreman , and Bull was not staying because he loved Colby . It was true that he never spoke a derogatory word concerning him , nor once had he criticized his methods as foreman , but Texas Pete knew as well as though Bull had told him that the latter had no use for the foreman . What was it , then , that was keeping Bull ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to harbor the only answer that his knowledge of events permitted him to entertain ; but that answer to the question persisted in obtruding itself upon his consciousness . If Bull was , after all , The Black Coyote he could not work to better advantage as a bandit than while in the employ of the Bar Y outfit , where he could  | easily obtain first-hand knowledge of every important bullion shipment . " By gollies ! " soliloquized Texas Pete , " I do n't give a durn ef he be , but I 'll be durned ef I believe it yit ! " At the house Hal Colby was talking earnestly to Lillian Manill in the sitting room . Supper had not yet been served , Corson had gone to his room to clean up and Diana had not yet come down . " Look here , Lill , " Colby was saying . " I do n't like the way Corson 's treatin ' Di . I think a heap o ' thet little girl an ' I do n't want to see her git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encircled his neck with her arms . " I thought you were all over that , Hal , " she said . " You 've been telling me how much you love , me , but how do you expect me to believe it if you 're always thinking of her and not ever considering my interests . You want her to have all the property and you do n't want me to have any . You do n't love me ! " " Yes , I do , Lill  --  I 'm crazy about you , " he insisted . " Then act like it , " she advised him , " and quit siding with her all the time . I 'm going to be a rich girl , Hal , and we can have a mighty good time after we 're married , if you do n't go and make a fool of yourself and try to keep me out of what rightly belongs to me . " " I ai n't always so durned sure you 're goin ' to  | marry me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thet feller Corson , an ' he 's sweet on you ? enny fool c 'd tell thet . " " Oh , pshaw ! " exclaimed Lillian Manill , laugh ing lightly ; " why , old Maurice is only like a big brother to me . Now give me a kiss and tell me that you wo n't let Diana or anyone else steal all our money . " She drew his face down to hers and their lips met in a long kiss . When they separated Colby was panting heavily . " Gawd ! " he exclaimed huskily . " I 'd commit murder fer you . " In the shadows of the hall stood Maurice B. Corson , scowling darkly upon them through the partially opened door-way . Presently he coughed discreetly and a moment later entered the room , where he found Lillian idly turning sheets of music at the piano , while Colby was industriously studying a picture that hung against the wall . Corson accosted them with a pleasant word and a jovial smile , and a minute later Diana Henders entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal , like its predecessors for some weeks , was marked'by noticeable constraint . The bulk of the conversation revolved about the weather , about the only thing that these four seemed to have in common that might be openly discussed , and as Arizona summer weather does not offer a wide field for discussion the meals were not conspicuous for the conversational heights attained . Nor was this one any  | exception to the rule . When it was nearly over Corson cleared his throat as is the habit of many when about to open an unpleasant subject after long deliberation . " Miss Henders , " he commenced . Hal Colby arose . " I got ta see Bull before he leaves , " he announced hastily , and left the room . Corson started again . " Miss Henders , " he repeated , " I have a painful duty to perform . I have tried to work in harmony with you , but I have never met with any cooperation on your part , and so I am forced to reveal a fact that we might successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my judgment in the matter of the sale of the property . " " And what fact is that ? " asked Diana , politely . " We will get to it presently , " he told her . " Now , my dear young lady , your father 's death has left you in very unfortunate circumstances , but , of course , as is natural , Miss Manill wants to do what she can for you . " " I am afraid that I do not understand , " said Diana . " Lillian and I have suffered equally in the loss of our fathers and our uncles , and together we have inherited the responsibilities of a rather large and sometimes cumbersome business . I am sure that we wish to help one another as much as possible  --  I as much as she . " " I am afraid that you do not understand , Miss Renders , " said Corson , solemnly . " By the terms  | of your uncle 's will everything would have gone to your father had he survived Mr. Manill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , leaving everything to your uncle . So you see , Miss Renders ! " Corson spread his palms and raised his brows in a gesture of helplessness . " I must be very dense , " said Diana , " for I am sure I do not know even yet what you are driving at , Mr. Corson . " " It is just this , " he explained ; " your father left everything to your uncle  --  your uncle left everything to his daughter . It is very sad , Miss Renders ? Miss Manill has grieved over it a great deal ; but the law is clear  --  it leaves you penniless . " " But it is not what was intended and there must be another will , " exclaimed Diana . " Uncle John and Dad both wished that , when they were gone , the estate should be divided equally between their lawful heirs  --  half and half . Dad left such a will and it was his understanding that Uncle John had done likewise  --  and I know he must have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical ? Dad has told me so more than once . They had such implicit confidence in one another that each left everything to the other with the distinct understanding that eventually it all was to go to the heirs of both , as I have explained . " " I do not doubt that your father left such a will , if you say he did ; but the fact remains that Mr. Manill did not , " said Mr. Corson , emphatically .  | " But you shall not want , Miss Henders . Your cousin will see to that . She has already authorized me to arrange for an annuity that will keep you from want until you are married  --  we thought best not to continue it beyond that time for obvious reasons . " " You mean , " asked Diana , dully , " that I have nothing ? That I am a pauper  --  that even this roof under which I have lived nearly all my life does not belong , even in part , to me  --  that I have no right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , dear ! " exclaimed Lillian Manill . " You shall stay here just as long as you wish . You will always be welcome in my home . " " My home ! " Diana suppressed a sob that was partially grief and partially rage . The injustice of it ! To take advantage of a technicality to rob her of all that rightly belonged to her . She was glad though that they had come out into the open at last  --  why had they not done so before ? " Of course , " said Corson , " as Miss Manill says , you are welcome to remain here as long as the property is in her hands , but , as you know , we have received an advantageous offer for it and so it is only fair to tell you that you might as well make your plans accordingly . " " You are going to sell to Wainright for two hundred and fifty thousand ? " asked Diana . Corson nodded . Diana rose and walked the  | length of the room , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not going to sell , Mr. Corson , if there is any way in which I can prevent it . You are not going to steal my property so easily . Why have you been attempting all these weeks to persuade me to agree to a sale if you knew all along that I had no interest whatsoever in the property ? " she demanded suddenly . " That was solely due to a desire on our part to make it as easy as possible for you , " he explained , suavely . " Your cousin would have given you half the purchase price rather than have had to tell you the truth , Miss Henders ; but you have forced it upon us . She desires to sell . It is her property . You alone stood in the way . You have been your own worst enemy , Miss Henders . You might have had one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars had you not been stubborn  --  now you must be content with whatever Miss Manill sees fit to allow you in the way of an annuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miss Manill shall give me nothing ? I will not accept as a gratuity what rightfully belongs to me . If you think , Mr. Corson , that you are going to take my property away from me without a fight , you are mistaken , " and she wheeled about and started for the doorway . " Wait a moment , Miss Renders ! " cried the New Yorker . " I am a lawyer and I know how expensive litigation is . Such a case as you contem-  | plate , and I take it for granted that you purpose taking the matter to court when you say fight , ' might drag on for years , wasting the entire property in attorneys ' fees and legal expense , so that neither of you would get anything  --  I have seen such things happen scores of times . " Now , let us rather compromise . We were willing to make you a gift of half the purchase price immediately on the consummation of the sale to Mr. Wainright . That offer is still open . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my advice you will accept it . " " Never ! " snapped Diana . Corson and Lillian sat in silence listening to Diana 's foot-falls as she ascended the stairs . Presently they heard her door close , then the girl turned upon Corson . " You poor sucker , you ! " she exclaimed . " What do you think you are , offering her a hundred and twenty-five thousand when we do n't have to give her a cent ! " " Do n't be a hog , Lill , " advised the man . " We 'll get enough , and if we can save a lot of trouble we 'd better let her have the hundred and twenty-five . You ca n't tell what these people out here 'll do . " Take that Bull fellow , for instance  --  he 's already offered to run us out of the country if she says to . Look what he did to old man Wainright , for instance . Why , say , there are a lot of her friends here that would think no more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their  | Sunday dinners , if she just so much as hinted that she thought we were trying to do her out of anything . " And we 'll be getting plenty , anyway  --  you and I each get a third and Wainright gets the other third  --  and that mine alone is worth millions . Why , we could afford to give her the whole two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if she 'd agree to the sale . " " I 'm not so keen as you on giving my money away , " replied Lillian . " Your money , hell , " he replied . " You would n't have anything if it was n't for me , and as for that measly little hundred and twenty-five thousand , why , it 'll cost us all of that to square these people around here before we get through with it  --  I 've promised Colby ten thousand already , and say , speaking of Colby , I saw you two in the sitting room before supper . You got to lay off that business  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You belong to me , " he added suddenly and fiercely . " Oh , come on , Maurice , do n't be silly , " replied Lillian . " You told me to get him on our side . How did you suppose I was going to do it  --  by making faces at him ? " " Well , you do n't have to go too far . I heard you telling him what you two would do after you were married . You may be a good little actress , Lill , but that kiss you gave him looked too damn  | realistic to suit me . I 'm not going to have you running off with him after you get your mitts on a little money . " " Say , you do n't think I 'd marry that rube , do you ? " and Lillian Manill burst into peals of laughter . Colby found Bull in the bunk-house . " Bull , " he said , " I wish you 'd ride up Belter 's tomorrer an ' see how the water 's holdin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Texas Pete , " I got the rest of it : " An ' so we lines up at the bar , twelve or more ; The boss tries to smile , but he caint , he 's so sore . The stranger says : Pronto ! you durn little runt . ' Jest then we hears some one come in at the front , " An ' turnin ' to look we see there in the door A thin little woman  --  my gosh , she was pore ! ? Who lets her eyes range til they rest on this bloke With funny ideas about what was a joke . " She walks right acrost an ' takes holt o ' his ear . You orn'ry old buzzard , ' she says , you come here ! ' He give us a smile thet was knock-kneed an ' lame , An ' , Yes , dear , I 'm comin ' ! ' he says , an ' he came . "  | CHAPTER XIII THE NECKTIE PARTY W HEN Diana Renders left the dining room after hearing Corson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate of her father and uncle she definitely severed relations with the two whom she now firmly believed had entered into a conspiracy to rob her of her all . The following day she ate her meals in the kitchen with Wong to whom she confided her troubles . The old Chinaman listened intently until she was through , then he arose and crossed the kitchen to a cupboard , a crafty smile playing over his wrinkled , yellow countenance . " Me fixee ? me no likum , " he said , as he returned with a phial of white powder in his hand . " O , Wong ! No ! No ! " cried the girl , grasping instantly the faithful servitor 's intent . " You must n't do anything so horrible as that . Promise me that you wo n't . " " All lightee ? jest samee you say , " he replied with a shrug , and returned the phial to the cupboard . " I 'm going away tonight , Wong , " she told him , " and I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am away and that you will stay until I return . There is no one else I could trust to look after the house . " " You clomee backee ? " " Yes , Wong , I 'm going to Hendersville tonight so that I can catch the stage for Aldea in the morning . I am going to take the train for Kansas City and consult some of Dad 's friends and get them to recommend a good lawyer . You 'll take care of things for me , Wong ? " " You bletee blootee ! " That afternoon she sent for Hal Colby and told him what Corson had said to her . Colby seemed ill at ease and embarrassed . " I 'm mighty sorry , Di , " he said , " but I do n't see what you kin do about it . If I was you I 'd accept half the purchase price . They got you deadto-rights an ' you wo n't make no money fightin ' ' em . " " Well , I wo n't accept it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's only fer your own good , Di , " he assured her . " It ai n't Lillian 's fault that your uncle done your dad outen the property . You cai n't blame her fer wantin ' what was left to her an ' I think it was mighty pretty of her to offer to split with you . " " I do n't , " she replied , " and I think there is something behind that offer that is not apparent on the face of it . I am going to find out , too . I 'm going to Kansas City to hire a lawyer and I 'll want the  | buck-board and one of the men to drive me to town after supper tonight . " " I 'm plumb sorry , Di , but Corson an ' Lillian . have took the buck-board to town already . " " Then I 'll go on Captain , " she said . " Please have him saddled for me right after supper . " She packed her traveling dress and other necessary articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , leaving on her buckskin skirt and blouse for the ride to town , and after supper made her way to the corral after waiting a few minutes for Captain to be brought to the house and rather wondering why Hal had neglected to do so . To her surprise she discovered that Captain hac not even been saddled , and was , as a matter of fact , still running in the pasture a mile from the house . She went to the bunk-house to get one of the men to catch him up , but found it deserted . From there she walked to the cook-house , where she found only the cook setting bread for the morrow. - " Where are all the men ? " she asked . " They 's a dance to Johnson 's tonight an ' some of ' em went there , " he told her . " The rest went to town . Idaho , Shorty an ' Pete went to the dance . " " Where 's Hal ? " " I reckon he went to town ? I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did Willie go too ? " " No 'm , he 's here sommers ? hey , Willie ! You Willie ! "  | Willie appeared from the outer dusk . " Oh , Willie , " said Diana , " wo n't you please catch Captain up for me and saddle him ? " " You ai n't goin ' to ride tonight all alone , be you ? " he asked . " I 've got to get to town , Willie , and Hal forgot to tell anyone to ride with me , " she explained . " Well , I 'll go along with you , " said Willie . " I 'll have the hosses saddled pronto , " and off he ran . Ten minutes later they were in the saddle and loping away through the rapidly falling night toward town . " I ca n't understand how Hal happened to let all the boys go at the same time , " she said , half musingly . " It was never done before and it is n't safe . " " Bull would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bull was a top-notch foreman . " " You like Bull ? " she asked . " You bet I do , " declared Willie , emphatically ; " do n't you ? " " I like all the boys , " she replied . " Bull would n't never have left you here alone at night . He set a heap o ' store by you , Miss . " Willie was emboldened to speak freely because of the darkness that would cover any sudden embarrassment he might feel if he went too far . The same darkness covered Diana 's flush  --  a flush of contrition that she harbored a belief in Bull 's villainy . Before they entered Hendersville they became  | aware that something unusual was going on in town . They could hear the hum of excited voices above which rose an occasional shout , and as they rode into the single street they saw a hundred figures surging to and fro before Gum 's Place . A man stood on the veranda of the saloon haranguing the crowd . " This business has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie paused at the outskirts of the crowd . " It 's high time we put a end to it . You all knows whose ' a ' doin ' it as well as I do . What we orter do is ride out ' n git him tonightthey 's a bunch o ' cottonwoods where he is right handy an ' we got plenty o ' ropes in the cow-country . Whose with me ? " Two score voices yelled in savage assurance of their owners ' hearty cooperation . " Then git your bronchs , " cried the speaker , " an ' we 'll go after him an ' git him ! " Diana saw that the orator was Hal Colby . She turned to one of the men who was remaining as the majority of the others hastened after their ponies . " What is it all about ? " she asked . " What has happened ? " The man looked up at her , and as he recognized her , pulled off his hat awkwardly . " Oh , it 's you , Miss Henders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ag'in today an ' Mack Harber was kilt  --  it was his first trip since he was wounded that time . It was the first trip , too , since Bull quit guardin ' the  | gold , an ' a lot o ' the fellers has got it in their heads thet it 's Bull as done it . " " ' Tai n't no sech thing ! " cried a little old man , near-by , " ' tai n't Bull . " The speaker was Wildcat Bob . " I do n't like to think so neither , " said the first man ; " but it shore looks bad fer him  --  the fellers is all het up . There ai n't one in thet crowd but what would lynch his gran-maw ef he had another drink , an ' they sure hev had plenty  --  Gum 's ben settin " em up in there fer a coupla hours on the house . Never did see Gum so plumb liberal . " " He 's aimin ' to get someone else to go after The Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be so doggone liberal with his rot-gut  --  he could n't git up enough nerve ef he drunk a whole distillery . " " You think they really intend to lynch Bull ? " asked the girl . " They ai n't no two ways about it , Miss , " said the man she had first accosted . " They 're aimin ' to do it an ' I reckon they will . You see they 're pretty sore . Mack tried to put up a little fight an ' this Black Coyote feller bored him plumb between the eyes . Then he takes the gold , cuts all the hosses loose from the stage an ' vamooses . Thet 's why we did n't hear of it ' til just a bit ago , cause they did n't have no way to git to town only hoofin ' it . " Already the avenging mob was gathering . They came whooping , reeling in their saddles . Not one of them , sober , would have gone out after the ex-  | foreman of the Bar Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and Diana knew that they would carry out their purpose . They were going to lynch Bull ! It seemed incredible , and yet , could she blame them ? Knowing him as she did she had herself half admitted the truth of the rumor of his guilt before this , the latest outrage , that seemed to fix the responsibility beyond peradventure of a doubt . For the six weeks that Bull had guarded the bullion there had been no holdup , and now on the very first stage day after he had been relieved the depredations had been renewed . She recalled the fact that he had been seen with Gregorio on the very afternoon of a previous holdup ; she recalled the blood upon his shirt that same day  --  the day that Mary Donovan had fired upon the bandits ; she thought of the bag of gold dust that he had displayed at the bunk-house . There seemed no possible avenue of escape from a belief in his guilt . The yelling avengers were milling around in a circle in front of Gum 's Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheriff appeared on the veranda and raised his hand for silence . " Ah 'm sheriff yere , " he said , " an as an ahm of the law Ah cai n't permit yo-all to go fer to lynch nobody , but Ah can an ' do invite yo-all in to hev a drink on the house befo ' yo go . " There was a wild shout of approval and a  | scramble for room at the tie rail . Those who lost out rode their ponies into the saloon , and as the last of them disappeared , Diana , who had lost sight of Willie in the jostle and excitement of the past few minutes , turned her pony about and rode back in the direction from which she had come . Just beyond the last house she turned abruptly to the left  --  the Bar Y ranch lay to the right ? urged Captain into a lope and started off through the darkness toward the west . Presently she struck a well-defined trail and then with a word and a touch of her spurs she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang through the night while the beating of his mistress ' heart kept time to the rapid fall of his unshod hoofs . What was she doing ? Was she mad ? A dozen times Diana Henders repeated those questions to herself , but the only answer was a monotonous cadence that beat upon her brain , reasonless , to the accompaniment of Captain 's flying hoofs : They shall not kill him ! They shall not kill him ! They shall not kill him ! Constantly she listened for sounds of the coming of the lynching party , though she knew that she had sufficient start to outdistance them completely , even had Captain not been the fleet and powerful runner that he was . It was ten miles to the West Ranch from Hendersville and the Captain made it in thirty minutes that night . Diana threw herself from the saddle at the gate  | and crawled through the bars , leaving Captain on wide stretched feet and with nose to ground blowing after his hard run , knowing that he would not move from the spot for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door . " Bull ! " she cried . " Bull ! " but there was no answer . Then she opened the door and entered , fumbling around for a table she found it and matches , striking one . The cabin , a one room affair , was empty . Her ride for nothing ! Bull was away , but they would hide in the brush and wait for him to come back and then they would shoot him down in cold blood , and he would never have a chance for his life . If she only knew where he had gone , she might ride out and meet him ; but she did not know . Wait ! There was one chance ! If he was The Black Coyote he would doubtless come in from the north or the northeast , for in the latter direction lay Hell 's Bend , the scene of his many holdups . But it was n't Bull ? it could n't be Bull ? Bull , of all the men in the world , could never have robbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain , standing with heaving sides and dilated nostrils . The animal staggered a bit as she mounted , but at a touch of the rein he turned and walked out into the sage brush toward the north . She rode for a quarter of a mile and then she reined in her mount and called the man 's name aloud .  | There was no reply and she turned to the east and rode in that direction for a while , now and then calling " Bull ! " her voice sounding strange and uncanny in her own ears . In the distance a coyote yapped and wailed . She turned and rode west to a point beyond the cabin and then back again , establishing a beat where she might hope to intercept the returning Bull before he reached the danger of the ambush . At intervals she called his name aloud , and presently she halted frequently to listen for the coming of the lynchers . It was a matchless Arizona night . The myriad stars blazing in the blue-black vault of infinite space cast their radiance softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle luminosity that rendered distant objects discernible in mass , if not in form , and because of it Diana saw the black bulk of the approaching horsemen while they were yet a considerable distance away , and , seeing them , dared not call Bull 's name aloud again . The mob rode silently now  --  a grim and terrible shadow creeping through the darkness to lay bloody hands upon its prey . A quarter of a mile from the cabin it halted while its members dismounted and , leaving a few to hold the horses , the balance crept stealthily forward on foot . Diana , too , had dismounted , knowing that she would be less conspicuous thus , and was leading Captain over a circuitous trail toward the north  | and east . The girl knelt and placed an ear to the ground . Faintly , as though at a great distance , she heard the rhythmic pounding of a horse 's hoofs . He was coming  --  loping through the night , Bull was coming  --  all unconscious of what awaited him there in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a short distance and listened again . If the sounds should be plainer now she would be sure that he was coming from the northeast . The self-appointed posse crept toward the cabin and according to a general plan imparted to them by Colby , separated into two sections and surrounded it , finally worming their way close in on hands and knees , taking advantage of the cover of the sage to shield them from the sight of the man they believed to be there , then Colby arose and walked boldly to the door . Knocking , he . called Bull 's name aloud . There was no response . " Hey , Bull ! " cried Colby again , in a friendly voice , " it 's Hal . " Still no reply . Colby pushed the door open and entered . Of all the motley crew that followed him he alone had the courage to do the thing he was doing now . He struck a match and lighted a candle that stood on the rude table , embedded in its own grease in the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior showed him that it was untenanted . He extinguished the light and  | returned to his party where word was passed around that they were to remain quietly in hiding where they were until the quarry came . In the meantime a lone horseman had thrown himself from a half-spent pony in the Bar Y ranch yard and seeing a light in the cook-house had burst in upon the astonished cook . " What in all tarnation 's the matter of ye , Wildcat Bob ? " he demanded . " Where 's Bull ? " asked the little old man . " Reckon he 's over at the West Ranch  --  leastways there 's were he 's supposed to be , why ? " " War n't they a gang o ' the boys jest here lookin ' for him ? " " No . " A burst of lurid profanity filled the room as Wildcat Bob explained just how he felt and what he thought of himself . " They set out to lynch Bull , " he explained finally , " an ' I supposin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' ' em , an ' now , ding-bust my ornery of carcass , like as not they already got him over at the West Ranch . Where 's the rest o ' the boys ? Where 's Texas Pete ? You do n't reckon thet critter 's with Colby , do you ? " " Not by a long shot , " replied the cook . " He 'd stick up fer Bull of he massacreed the whole durn county . So 'd Shorty an ' Idaho , but they ai n't none o ' ' em here  --  they 's all down to Johnson 's to a dance . "  | " Well , " said Wildcat Bob , " I done my best , which same ai n't no good . Ef I hed a hoss instead o ' a hunk o ' coyote fodder I 'd try to git to the West Ranch in time , but I reckon they ai n't no chance now . Howsumever I 'll do the best I kin . So-long ! " and he was gone . A half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his rider was taking a short cut straight across country for the West Ranch . It was a warm and lurid Wildcat Bob who plodded through the dust of Hendersville 's lone thoroughfare and stopped at the veranda of The Donovan House some time later to be accosted by one of a group gathered there in semi-silent expectancy . " The saints be praised ! " exclaimed Mary Donovan . " Is it a banchee or is it not ? " " It 's worse , " said Bill Gatlin , the stage driver ; " it 's Wildcat Bob ? walkin ' . " " Did they git the poor b'y ? " demanded Mary , whereat the little old gentleman burst forth anew with such a weird variety of oaths that Mr. Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , could feel the hot flush that mounted to his ears fairly scorching his skin . " Ef I ever gits a-hold o ' the blankety , blank , blank thet loaned me that blankety , blank , blank ewe-necked , ring-boned , spavined excuse fer a cayuse I 'll cut his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsetto . Finally Mary Donovan inveigled the facts from him . " Ye done well , Bob , thet ye did , " she as-  | sured him . " Shure an ' how was yese to know thet he was n't at the home ranch . " " I should n't think you 'd care if they did hang a bandit and murderer , " declared Mr. Jefferson Wainright , Jr . " Who in hell told you to think , you durn dude ? " screamed Wildcat Bob , reaching for his gun . Mr. Wainright sought the greater safety of the office , tipping over his chair and almost upsetting Mary Donovan in his haste . " Do n't shoot ! " he cried . " Do n't shoot ! I meant no offense . " Wildcat Bob would have followed him within , but Mary Donovan caught him around the waist and pushed him into a chair . " Be ca 'm , Robert , " she soothed him . As Diana arose to her feet after listening close to the ground for the second time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' had heard that the lone rider was rapidly approaching from the northeast and in that direction she again led Captain , intending to mount once more as soon as she had reached what she considered a safe distance from the cabin and the hidden watchers encircling it . She had forged ahead for about five minutes when the way dipped into a shallow swale in which the sage brush grew to greater size . Here would be a good place to remount , and with this intention crystallized she wound downward among the scattered brush toward the bottom ,  | when , rounding a particularly high bush , she came suddenly face to face with a man leading a horse . " Stick ' em up ! " whispered the man in a low voice , presenting an evil looking six-gun at the pit of her stomach . " Oh , Bull ! " she cried in low tones , for she would have known his voice among thousands . " You ? " he cried . " My gawd , Miss , what are you doin ' here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told him . " There are forty or fifty of them lying in the brush around your cabin now . They say that you held up the stage and killed Mack Harber today . " " And you came to warn me ? " His voice sounded far away , as though , groping for a truth he could not grasp , he spoke half to himself . " You must go away , Bull , " she told him . " You must leave the country . " He paid no attention to her words . " I seen a light flash fer a minute in the shack , " he said , " an ' so I reckoned I 'd hev a look around before I come too close . Thet was why I was walkin ' when I hearn you . I was just a-goin ' to leave Blazes here an ' go ahead an ' scout aroun ' a bit . Mount up now an ' I 'll take you home . " " No , " she said , " you get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to town . I 'm stopping at Mary 's tonight . " " I 'll ride with you , " he insisted .  | She knew him well enough to know that he would never let her ride to town alone through the night and so she mounted as he did and together they followed the swale which ran in the general direction of Hendersville . " You say you 're stoppin ' at Mary 's ? " he asked . " Just for tonight . I 'm taking the stage for Aldea in the morning . I 'm going to Kansas City to consult a lawyer . They are trying to take the property away from me , Bull , " and then she told him all that had transpired since yesterday . " You do n't need a lawyer , Miss , " he told her . " What you need is a two-gun man , only you do n't need him , ' cause you got one already . You go back to the ranch an ' come mornin ' there wo n't be airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' thet belongs to you . " " Oh , Bull , do n't you understand that you must n't do anything like that ? " she cried . " It would only make things worse than they are now . Wong wanted to poison them . " " Good of Wong ! " interjected Bull . " But we ca n't make murderers of ourselves just because they are wicked . " " It ai n't murder to kill a rattlesnake , " he reminded her . " But promise me that you wo n't , " she urged . " I would n't do nothin ' you did n't want done , Miss , " he said . They were nearing town now and could see the  | lights plainly , shining through the windows and doorways . " You 'd better go now , Bull , " she said . " Not ' til I get you in town safe , " he replied . " But I 'm safe now  --  it is only a little way , and I 'm afraid they might get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't git me now thet I know they 're after me , " he replied . " Say , Miss , " he exclaimed suddenly , " you ai n't asked me ef it was me kilt Mack . " She drew herself up proudly . " I 'll never ask you , Bull , " she said . " But you would n't hev come out to warn me ef you 'd thought it , " he suggested . She was silent for a moment , and then : " Yes , I would , Bull , " she said in a very little voice . He shrugged his shoulders . " As I told Pete , ef I had done it or ef I had n't done it , I 'd say I had n't , so what 's the use o ' wastin ' breath ; but I shore appreciates what you 've done , Miss . " " And you will go away ? " she asked . " No 'm I 'll stay here . I reckon you need me , Miss , from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spell . I 'll ride over to the ranch o ' nights now an ' then . Ef you happen to hear a meadow-lark settin ' up late after dark you 'll know it 's me . " " But I 'm afraid they 'll get you , Bull , if you stay in the country . They 're terribly angry , " she warned him . " They wo n't be so keen to find me after they 're sobered up a bit , " he said , with a smile . " Colby 's  | the only one thet 's got the nerve to go agin ' guns single-handed . " " I do n't see why he hates you so , " she said . " I used to think that he liked you . " " Then all I got to say , Miss , is thet you must be plumb blind , " said Bull . Diana was evidently not so blind as he thought her , for she flushed deliciously . " Now you must turn back , " she said . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't see you ridin ' in with me , " he replied . She reined in her horse and held out her hand to him . " Good-bye , Bull , " she said . He took her slim hand in his and pressed it strongly . " Good-bye ? Diana ! " said Bull . She spoke to Captain and moved off toward the little town and the man sat there in the darkness watching her retreating form until it was hidden behind a corner of The Donovan House .  | CHAPTER XIV BULL SEES COLBY BULL turned Blazes ' head toward the northeast and rode off slowly in the direction of Coyote Canyon near the head of which there was a wild and almost inaccessible country just east of Hell 's Bend Pass . There was water there and game for himself , with year round pasture for Blazes . As he rode he hummed a gay little air , quite unlike the grim , taciturn Bull that his acquaintances knew , for Bull was happy  --  happier that he had been for months . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode out there all alone to warn me . An ' once she said to me , Bull , ' says she , ' I do n't love any man , Bull , thet way ; but if ever I do he 'll know it without my tellin ' him . I 'll do something thet will prove it ? a girl always does . ' " Thet 's what she says ? them 's her very words . I ai n't never fergot ' em an ' I ai n't never goin ' to ? even of I do n't believe it . It was just her good heart that sent her out to warn me  --  she 'd a-done as much fer any of the boys . " When Diana reined in before those assembled on the veranda of The Donovan House she was greeted by a gasp of astonishment from Mary Donovan .  | " Diana Benders , child ! " she exclaimed . " What are ye doin ' here this time o ' night ? Sure an ' I thought ye had gone back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the av'nin ' . " Diana dismounted without making any reply and tied Captain to the rail in front of the hotel . As she mounted the steps to the veranda the younger Wainright rose , politely . Corson and the elder Wainright nodded , the latter grunting gruffly . Lillian Manill pretended that she did not see her . " I am going to stop here tonight , Mrs. Donovan , " said Diana to the proprietress , " that is if you have room for me . " " An ' if I did n't I 'd be after makin ' it , " replied the latter . " I wonder if you 'd mind putting Captain up for me , Bob , " said Diana , turning to the Wildcat , and as the old man stepped from the veranda to comply with her request , Diana turned and entered the office , followed by Mary Donovan . " May I have a cup of tea , Mrs. Donovan ? " asked the girl . " I feel all fagged out . This evening has been like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull ? " asked Mary . Diana nodded . " They ai n't back yit , " said Mary ; " but I suppose they got him , bad ' cess to ' em . " Diana came close to the older woman and whispered . " They did n't get him . I just saw him ? he brought me to the edge of town . "  | " Now , the Lord be praised for that ! " ejaculated Mary Donovan , " for shure an ' if it 's guilty he is I 'll not be after belavin ' it at all , at all . " ii II " It looks pretty bad for him , Mrs. Donovan , " said Diana , " but even so I ca n't believe it of him either ? I wo n't believe it . " " An ' no more do n't yese , darlin ' , " advised Mary Donovan , " an ' now make yersilf comfortable an ' I 'll have ye a cup o ' tay in no time . " As her hostess left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , appeared in the other which opened from the office , his hat in his hand . " May I have just a word with you , Miss Henders ? " he asked . The girl nodded her assent , though none too cordially , and Wainright entered the little sitting room . " I ca n't begin to tell you , Miss Henders , " he commenced , after clearing his throat , " how badly I feel over this matter that Mr. Corson has explained to us . There is n't any question , of course , about the unfairness and injustice of it ; but the fact remains that the law is the law , and I do n't see how you are going to get around it by fighting them . " " It is a matter , Mr. Wainright , that I do not care to discuss with you , " said Diana , rising . " Wait a minute , Miss Henders , " he begged . " That was n't exactly what I wanted to discuss with you , though it has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and it was that I wanted to talk over .  | Your father was a wealthy man  --  you have been accustomed to everything that money could buy in this country . To drop from affluence to penury in a single day is going to be mighty hard for you , and it is that I want to save you from . " " It is very kind of you , I am sure , " she told him , " but I can not see how you , of all people , can help me , for your own father is a party to this whole transaction . " " I think you are a bit hard on him , " he said . " You surely can not blame him for wanting to drive as good a bargain as possible  --  he is , first and last , a business man . " Diana only shrugged her shoulders . " Now , as , I said , " continued Mr. Wainright , " there is a way for you to continue to have , not only the luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time to retain the Bar Y Ranch . " She looked up at him questioningly . " Yes ! " she said , " and how ? " " By marrying me , Miss Henders . You know I love you . You know there is nothing I would not do for you . There is no sacrifice that I would not willingly and gladly make for you . I would die for you , dear girl , and thank God for the chance . " Diana Henders ' lip curled in scorn . " It seems to me that I heard you make that very assertion once before , Mr. Wainright , and in those self-same words  --  the night before you ran away , like the  | coward you are , and left us at the mercy of the Apaches . " If you had half the courage that you have effrontery , the lion would appear a mouse by comparison . Please , never mention the subject to me again , nor is there any reason why you should ever address me upon any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he cried as he was leaving the room . " You see if you do n't . You might have had one friend , and a good one , on your side ? now you have n't any . We 'll strip you to the last cent for this , and then you 'll marry some ignorant , unwashed cow-puncher and raise brats in a tumbledown shack for the rest of your life  --  that 's what you 'll do ! " " An do yuh know what you 'll do ? " demanded a squeaky voice behind him . Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , turned to see Wildcat Bob glaring at him from the center of the office floor . The young man turned a sickly hue and glanced hurriedly for an avenue of escape , but the Wildcat was between him and the outer doorway and was reaching for one of his terrible guns . With a half-stifled cry Wainright sprang into the sitting room and ran to Diana . Seizing her he whirled the girl about so that she was between him and the Wildcat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let him shoot me ! I 'm unarmed  --  it would be murder . Save me ! Save me ! "  | His screams brought his father , Corson , Lillian Manill and Mary Donovan to the room , where they saw the younger Wainright kneeling in abject terror behind Diana 's skirts . " What 's the meanin ' of all this ? " yelled the elder Wainright . " Your son insulted me  --  he asked me to marry him , " said Diana . " Let him go , Bob , " she directed the Wildcat . " Gosh-a-mighty , Miss ! " exclaimed the old man in an aggrieved tone , " yuh do n't mean it , do yuh ? Why , I just ben honin ' fer a chance to clean up this here whole bunch o ' tin-horns an ' now that I got an excuse it do n't seem right to let it pass . By cracky , it ai n't right ! ' Tai n't moral , that 's what it ai n't ! " " Please , Bob  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slowly Wildcat Bob returned his gun to its holster , shaking his head mournfully , and Jefferson Wainright , Jr. , arose and sneaked out of the room . As his party returned to the veranda the young man 's father was growling and spluttering in an undertone , but Wildcat Bob caught the words " law " and " sheriff . " " What 's thet ? " he demanded in his high falsetto . The elder Wainright cringed and stepped rapidly through the doorway . " Nothin ' , " he assured the Wildcat . " I did n't calc'late to say nothin ' at all . "  | It was almost morning when the weary and now sobered members of the necktie party returned to town . Gum Smith and several others , among whom was Wildcat Bob , met them in the street . " Git him ? " demanded the sheriff . " No , " replied Colby , " an ' I do n't savvy it neither  --  someone must o ' put him wise ; but I got some evidence , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's one o ' the bullion bags that was took from the stage yesterday  --  I found it under his blankets . He may o ' ben there an ' saw us comin ' , but thet ai n't likely ' cause we snuk up mighty keerful ? someone must o ' put him wise . " " Ah wondeh who-all it could o ' ben , " wondered Gum Smith . As the crowd was dispersing Wildcat Bob caught sight of Willie among them . " Hey , thar , you ! " he called . " What was you doin ' with thet bunch ? I thought you claimed to be a friend o ' Bull 's . " " Course I am , " maintained Willie , stoutly ; " but I hai n't never seed no one hanged . " A few hours later Diana Henders left on the stage for Aldea and after she had departed Corson and Lillian Manill drove back to the ranch , taking the Wainrights with them , while Hal Colby trotted along beside them . He had not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to do so . " We might save a right smart o ' trouble if we  | could get everything fixed up before she gets back , Corson , " the elder Wainright was saying . " The government patent to the land as well as Manill 's will are in the New York office , " replied Corson . " I 've sent for them . They ought to be along now any time . I rather expected them on yesterday 's stage  --  they certainly must come in on the next and I imagine she wo n't get back for a week at least ? that will give us three days . Then we 'll all go to Aldea , have the papers drawn up there , you turn the money over to us and Miss Manill and I can get away for New York on the train that night  --  I 've had all of this damn country I want . " Hal Colby , fortunately for his peace of mind , did not overhear the conversation . It outlined an entirely different plan from that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a plan which included a hasty wedding and a long honeymoon , during which the Bar Y foreman would taste the sweets of world travel in company with a charming and affectionate bride . " You 're goin ' to leave me here to run all the risk , eh ? " demanded Wainright , Sr. " Oh , there 's no risk now that that Bull fellow is out of the way , " Corson assured him . " I wish I was sure he was out o ' the way , " said Wainright , dubiously . " I do n't like that fellow a little bit . " " He 'll never show up again , " said Corson , con-  | fidently , " and anyway , just as soon as I get to New York I 'll look up a good man to represent me here , and I 'm going to pick the toughest one I can find in New York , too . " " I 'm afraid I 'm buyin ' a heap o ' trouble with that one-third interest o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But look what you 're going to get out of it , " Corson reminded him . " I 'll bet we take a million out of that mine in the next year . " Back at the ranch Colby was met by a scowling trio  --  Texas Pete , Shorty and Idaho . " Where 's Bull ? " demanded Texas . " How should I know ? " replied Colby , gruffly . " When was I elected his nurse-girl ? " " You went out after him with a bunch o ' drunken short-horns last night , " accused Shorty . " You know whether you got him or not . " " They did n't git him , " said Colby , shortly . " It 's a damn good thing fer you , Colby , thet they did n't , " said Texas Pete , " an ' another thing ? we wants our time . We ai n't a-aimin ' to work under no pole-cat no more . " " I reckon we kin git along without you , " retorted Colby , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week fer your checks  --  the boss ai n't here . " " Then we 'll stay ' til she is , " said Pete . " Suit yerselves , " replied Colby , as he turned and walked away . The routine of the ranch moved in its accustomed  | grooves as the days passed , though there was noticeably absent the spirit of good-fellowship that marks the daily life of a well-ordered cow outfit . A little coterie , headed by Texas Pete , herded by itself , in the vernacular of the West , while the remaining punchers grouped themselves about the foreman . Mealtimes , ordinarily noisy with rough but goodnatured badinage , had become silent moments to be gotten through with as rapidly as possible . There was a decorous restraint that was far too decorous , among these rough men , to augur aught of good . It revealed rather than veiled the proximity of open hostilities . There was one topic of conversation that was eschewed particularly . It would have been the steel to the flint of prejudice which lay embedded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the factions were together . The stage came again to Hendersville on the third day after Diana 's departure . It brought mail for the ranch , but the vaquero who had been sent from the Bar Y for it tarried longer at Gum 's Place ? Liquors and Cigars  --  than he had intended , with the result that it was well after supper and quite dark before he delivered it to the office . As he approached the yellow rectangle of the open office door it may have been the light shining in his eyes that prevented him seeing the figure of a man beneath the darkness of the cottonwoods that  | surround the house , or the horse , standing as silently as its master , fifty feet away  --  a blazed face chestnut with two white hind feet . The vaquero entered the office , where Corson was sitting in conversation with the two Wainrights , and laid the mail upon the table . The New Yorker picked it up and ran through it . There was a bulky letter addressed to him , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , " he said , glancing quickly through two enclosures and laying them aside to peruse the accompanying letter . The man beneath the shadows of the cottonwoods moved closer to the open office doorway , keeping well out of the yellow shaft of lamp-light . Bull had not come down to the Bar Y from his hiding place in Coyote Canyon for the purpose of spying upon Corson . He had hoped against hope that Diana might return on the day 's stage , for he wanted a word with her . He knew that she could not have made the trip to Kansas City and return in so short a time , but then she might have changed her mind at Aldea and given up the trip . It was on this chance that he had come down out of the mountains tonight . Diana had not returned  --  he had convinced himself of this  --  but still he tarried . These were her enemies . It could do no harm to keep an eye on them . He did not like the proprietorial airs of Corson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and as for the Wainrights , they too seemed much  | more at home than suited Bull . His hand caressed the butt of a six-gun affectionately . " Hell ! " exclaimed Corson , explosively . " The addle-brained idiot ! " " What 's the matter ? " inquired the elder Wainright . Corson was in the midst of the letter . He shook it violently and angrily in lieu of anything more closely representative of its writer . " The chump has dug up some papers that we do n't want  --  we do n't want ' em in Arizona at all . He 's a new man . I thought he had good sense and discretion , but he has n't either . He 's sendin ' ' em out here by registered mail . " If anything happens to them , if they fall into the Henders girl 's hands our goose is cooked . He says they put a new aspect on the situation ' and that he knows I 'll be delighted to have them . ' They surely will put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ' em  --  not here . " If I 'd had any sense I 'd have destroyed them before I left New York ; but who 'd have thought that they were n't safe right in my own office . I 'd be delighted to have him  --  by the neck . Lord ! suppose they 're lost now ! They should have been here with this other mail . " " If it 's registered stuff it may have been delayed just enough to miss the stage at Aldea by one train , " suggested Wainright . " If that is the case it 'll be along by the next stage . "  | " What were the papers ? " demanded the elder Wainright , suspiciously . Corson hesitated . He realized that he had been surprised by his anger into saying too much . " Perhaps I overestimate their value , " he said . " They might not do any harm after all . " " What were they ? " insisted Mr. Wainright . " Oh , they were reports that show the tremendous value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corson , glibly . Wainright sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief . " Oh , if that 's all they was we do n't need to worry none about them , " he said . " We as good as got the place now . We 'll drive over to Aldea tomorrer and fix things up , eh ? " " I think I 'll wait for the next mail , " said Corson . " Those reports might not do any harm , but I 'd rather be here when they come and see that no one else gets hold of them . " " Mebby you 're right , " assented Wainright . He arose , yawning , and stretched . " I calc'late to go to bed , " he said . " I think I 'll do the same , " said his son . " I hope Miss Manill is feeling better by morning . " " Oh , she 'll be all right , " said Corson. " just a little headache . Good night ! I 'm coming along too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office , and departed for their rooms . The man in the shadows turned slowly toward his horse , but he had  | taken only a few steps when he halted listening . Some one was approaching . He glanced through the darkness in the direction of the sounds which came out of the night along the pathway from the bunk-house . Stepping quickly behind the bole of a large tree , Bull waited in silence . Presently he saw dimly the figure of a man and as it came nearer the star-light revealed its identity . It was Colby . Like himself , Colby waited in the shadows of the trees  --  waited silently , watching the dead black of the office windows . The silence was tangible , it was so absolutely dominant , reigning supreme in a world of darkness . Bull wondered that the other did not hear his breathing . He marvelled at the quietness of Blazes  --  even the roller in his bit lay silent . But it could not last much longer  --  the horse was sure to move in a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion . There would be shooting . Bull did not want to shoot Colby  --  not now . There were two reasons . One however would have been enough  --  that Diana Henders was thinking of marrying this man . And then the silence was broken . Very slightly only was it broken . A suspicion of a sound came from the interior of the house , and following it a dim light wavering mysteriously upon the office walls , growing steadily brighter until the room was suddenly illuminated .  | From where he now stood Bull could not see the interior of the office , but he knew that some one carrying a lamp had come down the stairway , along the hall and entered the office . Then he saw Colby move forward and step lightly to the veranda and an instant later the office door swung open , revealing Lillian Manill in diaphanous negligee . Bull saw Colby seize the girl , strain her to him and cover her lips with kisses . Then the girl drew her lover into the room and closed the door . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and rode slowly away . Now there was only one reason why he could not kill Colby yet .  | CHAPTER XV " NOW , GO ! " I T WAS Wednesday again . Four horses , sweat streaked , toiled laboriously to drag the heavy coach up the north side of Hell 's Bend Pass . It was a tough pull even with a light load  --  one that really demanded six horses and would have had six in the old days  --  and today the load was light . There was but a single passenger . She sat on the driver 's box with Bill Gatlin with whom she was in earnest discussion . " I tell you I do n't believe he did it , " she was saying . " I 'll never believe that he did it , and I 'm mighty glad that he got away . " Gatlin shook his head . " There ai n't no one got a better right to say that than you has , Miss , " he said , " fer ' t was your gold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; but nevertheless an ' howsum-ever I got my own private opinion what I 'm keepin ' to myself thet it was Bull all right as done it . " " I 'd just like to see this Black Coyote once , " said the girl . " I 'd know if it was Bull or not . " " They ai n't no chance today , Miss , " Gatlin told her . " They ai n't no gold shipment today , unless I 'm mighty mistook . "  | " Do n't he ever make a mistake ? " asked the girl . " Never hai n't yet , Miss . " Diana relapsed into silence , her thoughts reverting to her interview with the Kansas City attorney . He had not held out very roseate hopes . By means of litigation  --  long and expensive  --  she might , after a number of years , get a small portion of her father 's share of the business . She had better take a cash settlement , if she could get one , he thought . A hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , in his opinion , than a long-drawn-out law suit that could be nothing better than an expensive gamble with the odds against her . " But I wo n't ! I wo n't ! I wo n't be robbed , " she ejaculated beneath her breath . " How 's that , Miss ? " inquired Bill Gatlin . " Was you speakin ' to me ? " " I must have been thinking aloud , " she said , smiling . " What a long pull this is , Bill ! " " We 're nigh to the summit , " he replied , pulling in his team to breathe them for a moment . On the shoulder of Wagon Mountain overlooking the south stretch of Hell 's Bend Pass road two men sat their horses amidst a clump of chaparral that effectually hid them from the road , though they could see nearly its entire length from the summit to the gap at the bottom . Presently one of them spoke . " Here it comes , " he said . He was a swarthy ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bandit . His companion was adjusting a black silk handkerchief across his face in such a way as to entirely hide his features . There were two small holes cut in the handkerchief opposite its wearer 's eyes which , through them , were fixed upon the stage as it topped the pass and started downward upon its rapid and careening descent toward the gap and Henders ville . " Come , " said Gregorio , and wheeled his horse about . His companion 's mount moved suddenly before the handkerchief was finally adjusted and as the man reached for his reins the thing fell away from his face , revealing it . It was Bull . A second attempt was more successful and then the men rode down the sheer mountain-side , keeping just below the crest upon the south side and hidden from the view of the driver and the passenger upon the stage . Their horses moved with extreme care and without haste , for the way was precarious , occasionally requiring that the horses sit upon their haunches and slide for short distances until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by the dangers of the descent or fear of being late at their rendezvous , suggesting habitude with the work in hand . In a dense growth of scrub just above the gap they tied their horses , continuing on foot .  | The stage lumbered downward , rocking from side to side . Diana held tight and said nothing . She had ridden with Bill Gatlin before , many times . He glanced at her out of the corner of an eye . " This ai n't nothin ' , " he said , as though in answer to a remonstrance on her part . Diana knew what was coming . She had heard it many times . " No , siree , " continued Bill , " this ai n't nothin ' . Why , you 'd orter ben with me one night when I was on the Denver run in the ol ' days , afore the railroads spiled the country . The trail crossed plumb over the top of a mountain . ' Twar n't no road . ' Twar n't nothin ' but a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' passengers a-hangin ' onto the boot . It was pitch dark  --  the doggonest , darkest night I ever see . Could n't see airy wheel-horse . Only ways I knowed I hed any horses was when their shoes struck fire on the stony parts o ' the road . Jest afore we struck the top o ' the mountain they was the worst cloud-bust I ever did see . Them horses had to swim the last hundred rods to the top o ' thet mountain , an ' the ol ' stage was bobbin ' aroun ' so on the waves thet eight of the passengers got sea-sick . " But thet wa' n't nothin ' . When we come to the top I found the road 'd ben all washed away . They wa' n't no more road ' n a jack-rabbit ; but I was a-carryin ' the mail , jest like I be now an ' I hed to git through . It was a high mountain an ' tolably steep , but not no trees , so I see there wa' n't only   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
