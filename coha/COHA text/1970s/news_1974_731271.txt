txt With the Kissinger party , Moscow Can the two superpowers bring under control that latest in nuclear monsters , the MIRV ? That is the paramount and crucial question that confronts Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger as he braces for talks with Kremlin leaders amid a new mood of uncertainty in Soviet-American relations . ( The MIRV is the many-headed intercontinental rocket whose nuclear heads can be guided separately by its launchers onto different targets in a wide area . ) The stakes are high . The Russians are still only testing MIRVs , or multiple warheads , while the United States is leagues ahead in MIRV technology and has already deployed the lethal weapon in great numbers . But since SALT 1 ( the first phase of talks on controlling strategic arms which culminated in the Nixon-Brezhnev agreement of May , 1972 ) the Soviet Union has tested four new launching systems ? the biggest of which , the SSX-18 , has 30 percent more throw weight than the SS-9 , now being deployed . C ounterfor ce capability If these monsters were equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians a major one-sided counterforce capability . A senior American official traveling with the Kissinger party says that if a SALT agreement is reached this year during SALT 2 ( the second phase of talks which began in November , 1972 , and is still under way ) , it will not be a comprehensive one ; in other words it will be a partial accord . But it could include MIRVs . Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin , for his part , who traveled back to Moscow aboard the Kissinger plane , expresses smiling optimism that an agreement can be reached that includes specific numbers of weaponry , perhaps even during the Secretary of State 's visit . En route home he bantered jovially with newsmen and conveyed a distinctly upbeat note . Realistic climate But the Kissinger mission comes at a time when the euphoria of early summit days has been supplanted by a tougher , more realistic climate . There are frictions in the Middle East . Congress has been blocking the administration 's efforts to win trade benefits for the Soviet Union . And , to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of an impeachment inquiry . The Watergate affair in fact must be ' an added psychological pressure on Dr. Kissinger , whose every move will be watched by some segments back home for its domestic political motives . Although American officials say that Dr. Kissinger has had good talks on SALT with the Soviet Ambassador in recent days , it remains to be seen how this will translate into progress when the Secretary sits dawn with Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev . Breakthrough on goals Dr. Kissinger 's efforts in Moscow , says a senior American official , will be to achieve a " conceptual break*Please turn to Page 4 *Harnessing // through " with the Russians on what the two sides want to accomplish in SALT at this stage . Technical information has been exchanged and the U.S. has presented its own conceptual approaches . If it is decided that MIRV will be dealt with , says the official , it will be necessary to define precisely how . This could be done with respect to launchers , numbers of warheads , or payload ? or a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out in Moscow , the official adds , the details would be left to the technical negotiations in Geneva . It is still thought President Nixon will journey to Moscow in June , apparently to sign some broad principles in advance of a completed accord . " It 's going to be tough , " commented the official of the SALT . discussions . Among other subjects to be discussed in three days of talks is the Middle East and how to move forward toward disengagement on the Syrian front . The subject is sensitive because the Russians are irked by the dominance of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East and would prefere that the venue of the talks move from Washington back to Geneva . According to American officials , the Secretary does not need Soviet help to get the Syrians to the negotiating table but may need it later on to achieve an agreement . Also on the agenda will be the trade issue . The Congress threatens to bar normal tariff treatment and credits to the Russians unless Moscow permits free emigration of its citizens . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Jews who have been trying to get out of the country . The list was provided by American Jewish organizations and the Secretary will take up the matter with Soviet leaders . According to American officials , many senators now are trying to find a way to back away from the strong demand of the Jackson-Vanik amendment . ( This is the amendment making passage by Congress of trade legislation favorable to the Russians dependent on Moscow 's letting those Jews who so want to emigrate from the Soviet Union . ) Where the Secretary of State is concerned , say these officials , there are two things he can not control : How much more the Soviet Government can do on the emigration issue , as it has made a major step forward already , and what Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington is willing to settle for . Assessing the Secretary 's mood , officials say that he puts down in Moscow convinced that a regularization of relations with the Soviet Union is a paramount necessity and with the view that he will make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet-American encounters .
