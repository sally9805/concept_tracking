PRICES Trying to Apply a Coffee Brake <P> Coffee , tea or ... ? That question was becoming rhetorical last week as Americans protested still another roadblock to their pursuit of happiness : the towering price of coffee . Manhattan 's elegant 21 Club offers free tea to discourage diners from ordering coffee ; eight blocks away , the Spindletop restaurant serves a free liqueur to coffee abstainers . Stop &; Shop , a Northeastern food-store chain , posted signs in many of its 157 supermarkets urging customers to buy beverages other than coffee . In Atlanta , Store Owner Albert Solomon displayed posters saying DO N'T BUY COFFEE . YOU CAN FORCE PRICES DOWN . Hartford , Conn. , Mayor George Athanson , who is up for re-election this year , flagged down a city bus , jumped aboard and urged riders not to buy coffee . <P> So far , the protest has not reached full-fledged boycott proportions . But it may well do so if prices keep rising-and they probably will drastically shoot up in the next month or so . Last month New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-week boycott and reduced her personal intake of coffee from 14 cups daily to none . She does not expect other coffee lovers to show the same fortitude-and is now back to two cups a day . But she does ask that they cut down : " Just pour half a cup . " <P> She has received responses from consumer activists in California , Washington , Texas and Canada . One group is organizing a coffee boycott in the Virgin Islands . Martin Rosengarten , president of Daitch-Shopwell stores in the New York City area , rigorously took up Guggenheimer 's cause . He ran ads urging less coffee buying and provided a 20 coupon good toward purchases of tea , cocoa or hot chocolate . <P> The reason for this outbreak of coffee nerves is that prices about doubled during the past 18 months , forcing many dining spots to abandon 20 or 25 cups of coffee ; 35 is now not unusual . Maxwell House , the most popular U.S. brand , sold to supermarkets for $1.46 per pound in July 1975 , but is now being sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaster of Folger 's , has raised its price to $3.08 . <P> Consumers have been protected from the full brunt of the hikes by supermarket discounting and the use of coffee as a loss leader to lure shoppers . Store brands are also slightly less expensive . But as current supplies run out , the full price will begin showing up on supermarket shelves . That could happen in three to six weeks . Says a spokesman for Sloan 's Supermarkets ( 34 stores ) in New York City : " We do not intend to subsidize the coffee companies any further . We 'd like to slow down coffee sales so coffee roasters will build inventories and we will get lower prices . "
