txt Gov . Ogilvie yesterday accused the Cook County Department of Public Aid of using meat-ax tactics in sabotaging his program for welfare cuts . In a speech to 300 Elmhurst service club members in a luncheon meeting hosted by Elmhurst Rotarians , Gov . Ogilvie said that if his cuts are not accepted , " the , alternative is bankruptcy  --  or higher taxes for every citizen in this state . And I have made it clear that I will not stand for either alternative . " Imposed on Everyone Gov . Ogilvie blasted the Cook County Department of Public Aid , which administers 90 per cent of the state 's general assistance welfare fund , saying the department " decided to take up the meat ax " in fighting the welfare cuts . " Instead of helping us to direct the burden of the reduction to single , employable individuals  --  those best able to absorb cuts  --  Cook County chose to impose sweeping cutbacks on everyone . " The governor denied charges that his program meant a 60 per cent slash in welfare payments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance funds either are employable or do not meet the requirements to receive welfare . He said those individuals in need of welfare would continue to receive aid . " In the last six years the welfare budget has grown from about $300 million to nearly $1.1 billion , " he said . " The costs of the medicaid program alone have gone from $81 million in 1966 , when Congress enacted the program , to a projected $435 million in the current fiscal year at previous funding levels . " It was in the face of these facts that we took some painful but absolutely necessary steps to reduce the incredible drain on state finances . Those steps were carefully thought out and designed to cause the least hardship on those who are truly in need  --  the disabled , the blind , the deaf and the helpless children of poor families . " Ogilvie explained that welfare costs in Illinois have been rising at a rate of more than 30 per cent a year for the last three years as compared to a 5 to 6 per cent rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this fiscal year , 84 per cent of the growth in state revenues was swallowed up by welfare , leaving only 16 per cent for everything else , including education . Informed of the governor 's comment , George W. Dunne , president of the Cook County Board , said it was the Ogilvie administration that " used the meat ax by ordering the cutback of two-thirds in general assistance funds . " " We felt that it would not be fair to follow the governor 's proposal to throw 20,000 people single employable recipients out on the street with nothing , " said Dunne .
