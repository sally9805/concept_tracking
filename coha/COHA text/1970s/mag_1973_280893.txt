He was dressed in blue jeans and a sweater and already looking forward to a three-month vacation on the coast of Maine , " hiking , riding-and I may even shovel a little snow . " In a relaxed and reflective mood , Archibald Cox talked with TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey about his aborted service as special prosecutor : <P> How did the White House raise objections to your activities before you were fired ? <P> The White House would call Attorney General Elliot Richardson and ask , " What does this guy think he 's doing ? " And then Elliot would take up these questions with me . The question that was constantly bothering people in the White House was , " What limits apply to Archie Cox ? " But Elliot was at all times entirely reasonable . There was never anything remotely resembling improper pressure . <P> Do you think your dismissal was linked to the investigation touching on Bebe Rebozo and the " campaign money " from Howard Hughes that he kept in a safe-deposit box for three years ? <P> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one thing precipitated the recent events . It is more likely that several things came together . <P> Were you deeply involved in investigating the Rebozo matter ? <P> We had done some poking around , but frankly this was an area where I gave my staff more autonomy and stayed reasonably clear of it myself because my brother 's firm Davis &; Cox is Hughes ' primary counsel . I told my staff to get cracking , and of course I would have been involved in any major decisions as time went on . <P> Why would Rebozo have kept the money where it was not even earning interest ? <P> Well , I do n't know that . But Herbert Kalmbach the President 's personal lawyer at the time , according to his testimony before the Senate committee , kept an even larger sum of money-left over from the 1968 Presidential campaign-in safe-deposit boxes . If you have any knowledge of mathematics , it makes you wonder , but that is Kalmbach 's testimony . <P> It has been charged that the Nixon Administration is the most corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding conduct in high office is stronger and more widespread than in any Administration I can recall , but the question of guilt or innocence remains open in my mind and remains to be established . <P> Do you think President Nixon should be impeached ? <P> It would not be proper for me to comment . I am sure that any President who refuses to comply with court orders and to abide by the rule of law ought to be impeached . <P> Do you have confidence that the work you started will go forward without you ? <P> As of today , the Senate and the House and the American people will insist upon it . <P> Will you play any future role in the investigation ? <P> Well , I 'll be glad to help anyone who may be appointed to take it over . <P> Has this experience left you with any bitterness ? <P> No , it 's left me with a regenerated faith in the people 's ability to respond and to make a very determined President conform to the rule of law .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
