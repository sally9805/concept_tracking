txt After a night of exhausting and quarrelsome debate , the Republicancontrolled , Legislature today passed a $7.7-billion budget that contains an increase in business and sales taxes and 10 per cent reductions in aid for many of the state 's 1.6-million. welfare recipients . After most of the major budget bills had been given razor-thin approval by blearyeyed lawmakers ? many of them short of temper and long on rhetoric  --  they began passing a series of measures aimed , in part , at tightening state controls over education . The bills  --  such as one to place a moratorium for one year on sabbaticals for teachers in state-funded colleges ? were included in the price agreed to by the G.O.P. leadership for the support of conservative Republicans to pass a budget containing new tax increases . A Long , Long Night The Assembly began budget debate last night at 9:15 , and the Senate convened at 10:20 P.M. The Assembly debate was recessed at 5 A.M. , while the Senate deliberated until 7:50 A.M. after brief respites . The Assembly returned at 11:57 A.M. and recessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. and disbanded at 7:35 P.M. until Monday . The budget for the 1971.72 fiscal year that began Thursday , contains a tax increase package of $475-million . This is roughly 43 per cent of the $1.114-billion tax package that Governor Rockefeller asked for when he presented his record $8.45-billion request in January . About $760-million was pruned from Mr. Rockefeller 's request as the G.O.P. leadership , faced with strong opposiion in the generally acquiescent Republican ranks to the large number of proposed taxes , sought passage of a budget without the politically embarrassing recourse of having to woo the Democratic minority . It was this stand that forced the Republican to miss the budget deadline , that allowed the Democrats the luxury of watching the other side in disarray for a change and that permitted a cadre of Republican conservatives to exercise a force that was disproportionate to its number . After feverish negotiations during which Mr. Rockefeller was " taken for an unaccustomed ride , " as one lawmaker put it , a $7.7-billion budget , devoid of many of the fixes proposed by the Governor , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The budget bills were let into the chambers only after days of cautious nose-counting , political horse trading and promises to the Republican holdouts , who , at one point , numbered about 15 in the Assembly and five in the Senate . A total of 76 of the 79 Republicans in the Assembly and 298 of the 31 Republicans in the Senate were needed to pass the budget on a party line . The debates began late last night in both houses in a caustic atmosphere . The Democrats , who , earlier in the week had pledged united opposition to the budget , remained firm except for one Buffalo Assemblyman , Stephen R. Greco , who voted for the one-cent-on-the dollar increase in the sales tax , which , it is estimated , will yield revenues of about $307-million . Mr. Greco told newsmen only that he thought the sales tax would " help the City of Buffalo , " but other legislative sources said his vote meant that ? no Republican had to be responsible for casting the deciding vote . Enraged Democrats barred Mr. Greco today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not make as much political fuss in Erie County over the fact that the area 's Republicans had voted for the unpopular sales tax . Joseph Crangle , the Erie County Democratic Chairman and counsel to Assembly Minority Leader Stanley Steingut , called Mr. Greco " a Judas Iscariot . " In addition to the bill to raise the state 's share of the sales tax to 4 cents on the dollar , the budget included a proposal for raising business taxes by $168-million . These increases include raising the corporation franchise tax from 7 to 9 per cent , increasing the bank taxes from 6 to 8 per cent , and raising by 15 per cent each corporation utility taxes and the interest on insurance premiums . Many Tax Ideas Dropped Dropped were plans for a 10 per cent increase in the state income tax , special taxes for higher-income brackets , a series of " nuisance " tax increases on such things as motor vehicles , and rises of $59-million in taxes on liquor and beer . " You have come up with taxes that exempt the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Brewer of Queens , said in the debate . The cuts in welfare and Medicaid were made , he said , typifying the Democratic line , by " ruthless Republicans " who exempted the " beer barons " and who " would , if they could , repeal the 20th century . " The Republicans countered that the budget elated no one , but that it reflected the tight fiscal realities facing the state and , in that light , was " a responsible budget . " The major areas affected by the $760-million in cuts made in the Governor 's original budget included the elimination of about 10,000 state jobs , consolidation or elimination of a half dozen minor state agencies , such as the Office of Civil Defense , and cuts in welfare assistance , estimated at $159-million . Medicaid Cuts Made The trims include the elimination of thousands of " medically indigent " people from the Medicaid rolls by cutting the maximum eligibility to $4,500 for a family of four . The present standard is $5,000 . The service is limited only to physicians and eliminates dentists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room supplies , eyeglasses , dentures and prosthetic devices . Welfare payments will be reduced by 10 per cent , except , for those in the aged , blind land disabled categories . This involves raising the upstate welfare payments to the level of those in New York City , in line with court orders , but then paying only 90 per cent of this statewide standard for dependent families and individuals and families on home relief . Such a reduction is permitted under Federal regulations . At present a welfare family of four in New York City receives $231 a month plus heat and rent . This will be cut to $208 in the city and upstate .
