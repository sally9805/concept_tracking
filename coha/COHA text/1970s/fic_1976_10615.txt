" Cruikshank , Cruikshank , Cruikshank ? " " He 's loads of experience , Freddie , " Caroline said , " delivered most of the babies on this entire side of Inishowen .

" " Ballyutogue , are you saying Ballyutogue to me ? " " Yes , Freddie . " " Ballyutogue ? A village doctor delivering my grandson ? " Sir Frederick 's face froze as though he were in mid-seizure . Roger fortified his wife , grasping her hard on the shoulder as her father anguishedto his feet . Half of Sir Frederick 's rages were play acting , this was real . He continued to look at them stricken . " Are you insisting on this insanity ? " " The baby is going to be born right here , " she repeated . Confusion set in .

" " Nothing of the sort . I 'm saying the man is capable in any situa-tion . " " I demand , " he said , with fist coming into play on the desk , " to know who 's going to assist him .

Any disaster as a result of this folly will be clearly on your head . " Sir Frederick vanished , leaving loud evidences of his anger with an afterblow of bangings , clangings and thumpings . Roger started after him . " Do n't , " Caroline commanded . " He 's at his bully best now andp221there 's no reasoning with him . Let him go beat his head against the wall . He 'll be back . " Roger pushed his hair around , distressed . " It is his first grandchild , Caroline . Let me try to pacify him . " " No ! " she said sharply . " See here , you 're going to end up as upset as he is over this . " She silently , adamantly put her thick glasses on and began to riffle through plans on the desk . Roger looked wistfully in the direction of Weed 's departure . He was trapped between two of the most hardheadedbullies in Ulster acting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be obliterated in their love-hate cross fire . Caroline 's final two months passed with neither she nor her father yielding . Roger felt himself squeezed to the outside , almost like a stranger . The Weed passions were immovable . He spoke to Sir Frederick on business and only through the medium of Brigadier Swan . A quiet settled over Hubble Manor as father and daughter continued to be consumed by their own stubbornness . For once , neitherknew how to unknot the bindings and speak out first or even send a signal . Cycles of silence turned into cycles of tension as her time grew near . Once or twice Roger determined to break the ice , to go to Belfast himself , but Caroline 's ultimatums contained finality . The night which began with a slight but recognizable cramp grew painful , and as the time between pains narrowed , Roger sent for Dr. Cruikshank , then retreated to a special apartment prepared for the event . A number of hours passed with Roger beside her holding her hand and clocking the time between constrictions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " As long as my stomach holds , and then I 'll only be as far away as the next room . " He continued to stifle his annoyance that Cruikshank had not arrived . " Oh , Roger , " she said , " you 're a wonderful man . I 'm so glad about us . And I do adore the hell out of you . " " Come now , Countess , you say that to all the workmen . " " You 're such a shy little boy when we play our games . In the last month or so I 've thought up some wonderful things to do when all of this is over . For some mad reason , you excite me all the time . Something so . . . bloody wonderfully English ... " " Caroline , you 're embarrassing me .

She tightened her grip on him and writhed . It seemed far worse than the last pain . Roger stole a glance at his watch , then sighed with relief at sounds of commotion in the hall outside . Dr. Cruikshank entered , followed by a short squat woman . By dress and manner she was identified by Roger as a Catholic , most likely a tenant 's wife . " Sorry , m'lord , " the doctor said , " had an emergency at the quarry . " Roger arched with a reaction that sent off the unspoken message , " what at the stone quarry could possibly be more important than the Viscountess ? " Cruikshank got the vibrations as he bathed his hands in a basin and returned vibrations of his own . " Had to amputate . Rockslide . Poor chap lost both his legs . " The doctor 's message was that if ordinarysafety measures had been taken in his lordship 's quarry there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances from each other , the doctor made to bedside . " How are we doing , Lady Caroline ? " She nodded affirmatively . " How long between pains ? " " Just a bit under seven minutes , " Roger said . He dug through his bag , found the stethoscope and placed it on her belly and her heart . " We 've a bit of time . This is Mairead O'Neill , " he said . " She 's brought hundreds of young ones in all by herself . Mrs. O'Neill is the finest midwife I 've ever worked with . " Caroline nodded that she understood why he had made the choice but otherwise gave no greeting nor asked anything . Mairead was put in her station , even in this situation , but it did not matter to her . What seemed strange to her was the absence of questions she always heard from a first-time mother . Caroline felt a pain coming . As it swept through her she tightened up and broke into perspiration but uttered not a sound , looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me scream because I 'm from as strong a breed as any woman you 've ever met and I 'll show you courage . " Mairead wiped Caroline 's face and felt her pulse . " You 'll do better for all of us and yourself as well if you loosen up , m'lady . It makesp223everything go a lot easier . " After another series of pains failed to inducean outcry , Mairead looked at her with compassion . She leaned close out of earshot of the others . " You 've nothing to prove or gain by your behavior . We 're all the same when it comes to this . Let yourself go , darlin ' . " " I ca n't , " Caroline whispered . . . . " I ca n't . " The doctor drew Roger aside . " Everything looks fine , " he said . " Mrs. O'Neill will be preparing your wife now , Lord Roger . I think you should wait outside . " " We 've decided to go it together as long as I am able . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but quite nice . Odd pair these , stubborn as hell but so in it together . He scratched his head , trying to think of cause , but acquiesced . " Well , stay out of our way . The night blackened up outside and even as the pains intensified to excruciating thresholds , Caroline continued to refuse to cry out . In the seventh hour of her labor , Mairead tapped the dozing doctor . " It 's coming , " she said . Roger was up and at bedside holding his wife 's hand . " Bear down , m'lady , " Mairead said , " that 's it , bear down now , love , bear down . .. " " Freddie ! " Caroline shrieked at the instant of Jeremy 's birth . " Freddie ! Freddie ! Daddy ! Daddy ! Daddy ! " Having come to the most awesome decision of her life , Finola was determined to steel herself to go through with it , take all the necessary humiliation , for in her own eyes her sins were enormous . The priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was as it should be in the tradition of the Church . It was not in the mold of the simple cottages but a grand two-story home such as the more prominent Protestants owned in Ballyutogue . Widow O'Donnelly , the priest 's housekeeper , admitted Finola and led her to a small but fine room of soft deep furnishings which members of the parish had purchased two years earlier . " And how is wee Dary ? " Father Lynch inquired of the new baby . " You 'll not see the likes of that one again in a hundred , " she boasted of her favorite subject . " Dary will be a small child and morep224delicate than the others , but he 'll be sound , I 'll see to that . I never stop being grateful to the holy Mother for sparing his life . " Father Lynch accepted the gratitude on behalf of the Virgin . " And yourself , Finola ? What urgent matter brings you here ? " She twisted her fine linen handkerchief nervously and struggled to keep her composure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I am about to tell you should have been confessed many times over the years . " Father Lynch grimmed up and braced . " Father , " she whispered , lowering her eyes and voice weakening with shame , " I have been the wife of Tomas Larkin almost twenty years and I have sinned all during the marriage . " She squirmed , then blurted out , " I have always enjoyed pleasures of the flesh . " The priest shot to his feet , clasped his hands behind him and thrust his face heavenward . " I see , " he sighed . " Would you kindly amplify that remark ? " " I 've almost always enjoyed the sexual act , " she whispered . " That 's quite unnatural , you know . " " I know . " " Exactly what is it you enjoy ? " " Everything , " she whimpered . Father Lynch pulled his chair up close and poked his face next to hers . " What you have told me is extremely serious . If I am to counselyou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready ? " " Aye . . . I am ready . " " Look at me , Finola . " She did so out of the corners of her eyes and blushed with guilt . " We must go over this , item by item , " he commanded . It was degrading but if the gates of heaven were ever to open for her it had to be done . She confessed to one hedonistic pleasure after another , building a mountain of debauchery and mortal sins the likes of which he had never heard in his thirty-five years as an agent of God . Why , the woman reveled in everything ! Nudity , pinchings , slappings , biting , licking , kissing , rubbing , even down to the reprehensibleorgans themselves . It appeared there was nothing the two did n't do , even taste each other ! When Finola had drained herself , she sobbed . Father Lynch was ashen . " These are unnatural acts under the influence of Satan ! " She wailed , he paced . " I knew something might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to make babies and I could n't help myself for enjoyingit , I thought it really was n't actual pleasure I was feeling but some kind of holy experience about the possibility of becoming preg-nant . " " It 's a curse , " he said . " I know of many other women who have had these same carnal sensations but nothing as profane as you have spoken about . " " Oh , Father , what causes it ? " " It is God constantly reminding us of the original sin in the form of a woman , " he answered . " What is so very serious is that you have n't confessed this before . Have you at least prayed that these sensations would go away ? " " Not with any great sincerity . I pretended I did n't know what they were . " He shook his head numerously . " At least you have enough faith left to seek atonement . " " Atonement is only part of the problem , " she said . " It all came to roost with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very difficult time . Dr. Cruikshank warned Tomas and later myself that it would be fatal for me to have any more babies . " Damn that Cruikshank ! the priest thought . Always interfering with God 's work , telling such rubbish to the women . Yet with all his power he was too wise to challenge the doctor . If he gave advice to ignore the doctor and the woman died , the repercussions would be terrible . " I know it means violation of a holy duty , " Finola said , " and I am perfectly willing to risk the consequences but Tomas takes the doctor seriously . Oh , Father , I know in my heart that God is punishing us for what Tomas did at the time of Kilty 's passing . . . " " What is the problem then ? " he asked . " Now that my health has returned and even though we fear havingbabies , both of us are very much desiring to be husband and wife in bed again . " The priest felt violated . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue amassing sin upon sin . As his anger rose so did his determination to exorcise her of the demon which had seized her soul . " You have committed evil enough , attempting to cheat God by havingexperienced pleasures of the flesh and to further that evil by continuing to have carnal sensations year in and year out without confessing them . It is evil enough to abandon your duty to God and stop bearing children on the advice of a Protestant . . . but therep226can be no graver mortal sin than lusting after sex for the sake of sex ! " " What am I to do , Father ! Tomas and I act like strangers to one another . " " Tell me the truth . Do you still share the same bed ? " " That 's the misery of it , we do , " she wept . " Lying there side by side without touching , knowing we are never to have sex . He stays at the shebeen every night and when he does finally come home he just falls into bed , drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . " Finola gritted her teeth , trying to force the next words out , but they stuck . She knew there were safe times during the month for a woman to have sex with her husband and she wanted to appeal to the priest for dispensation to do it then , but it was clear by now he would never condone such a thing , for he was disgusted with her . " Oh , Father , help me , " she cried , falling to her knees . He hovered above his victim , then pointed a bony finger ... . " The reason you have these unnatural and evil desires is because of your neglect of mother church . Instead of yielding to temptation , you should have been confessing for years . You should have fortified your soul and you should have filled yourself with the pain , the goodness and the mercy of Jesus and Mary . You have offended God , grievously ! " Finola Larkin howled . " You are fortunate , woman , in that your Church is all-forgiving . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ? " " I 'll do anything ! " She remained on her knees as he considered the alternatives . " Your case is extreme . I must meditate for guidance . In due course I will work out a course of penance through prayer and offerings to the Church . When I do , do you swear to adhere to it faithfully ? " " Yes , Father , yes . " " Through this devotion , you will eventually find the strength to continue to live with Tomas in the only way possible . . . as brother and sister . You are never again to submit to him for sexual ravagement , for that sin would be final . Well , I 'm waiting for your answer . . . it 's that or hell ! " " I . . . I promise . ... " " Very well , " he said . " Finally , because your sin is so grave I do n't want to take chances that your penance was n't sufficient . You mustp227agree to give one of your sons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God will look favorably on your case , grant you quicker absolution on earth and shorten your time in purgatory . " " Tomas will fight having his son become a priest , " she cried . " That is your greatest chore , Finola Larkin . You must bring that man back to Jesus Christ on his knees . " " Father , he may choose to die first . " " Not if you do your duty . You are never to let him forget that it was his sins , his lechery , that brought you to this . In the end , when he returns to mother church , it will also give him the strength to forgo his lustful ways and live in peace with you as brother and sister . " Without offering her a hand to help her to her feet , he turned and walked to the door . " I must go meditate now . When I am done , I 'll send for you and tell you what your penance is to be . " In the autumn of eighteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a national school for the children of the outlying villages . Father Lynch did n't take kindly to the intrusion on what he considered to be a personal domain , but was forced to hold his tongue because Bishop Nugent was n't about to offend the British . He did n't have to worry because almost no one in the Upper Village contemplated going . Not only were the economics against it but much of the traditional Irish craving for knowledge died during the famine . Our daddies had gotten their schooling from the hedge teachers like Daddo Friel 's old man and Daddo himself , who traveled from village to village and held classes on the sunny side of the hedges . They were one part poet , one part Celtic scholar and one part regular teacher with the mission of keeping alive the ancient language and folklore . ' When they vanished from the scene , the Irish tongue vanished with them in our part of the country . The only schooling Conor and I received was a weekly class from Father Cluny , the curate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the scrapings of the pot , the last of the litter . It had its advantages . Aside from shepherding in the summer , I was generally useless around the farm and spoiled by my ma . There was no realp228reason for me not to attend the national school except for my parents ' fear of me being thrown into a lough full of Protestant sharks , but I pouted and tempered until they gave in . Conor had remained quiet about the school but there was no mistaking what was in his mind . ' When I told him the joyous news about myself , he was determined to make his own stand . We went up past the crossroad to the edge of the first fields and waited all afternoon . Conor sat with his back against the stone wall , more nervous and uncertain than he had ever acted before as he looked up the path for his daddy . Conor used to come here almost every day to meet Tomas untilthe last few months . Something queer was happening to the Larkins . Tomas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more to drink . A lot of people thought he was still grieving over the loss of Kilty although that had happened over a year ago . When he did come down from the hills that day his face broke into a smile on seeing Conor waiting for him again . " Can we talk , Daddy ? " Conor said . " Sure , soon as I get in and clean up . " " I 'd like to talk to you now . " " Well , if it 's that important , " he answered , sitting up on the wall , " what 's on your mind ? " " Seamus is going to the new national school , " Conor said . " I know that . Fergus and I spoke of it at great length . " " Well , I was kind of hoping that , you know , our family and the O'Neills always do things together and maybe I should be going to school with Seamus . " I smiled grandly in the affirmative that it was my wish also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually plunged into the heart of matters without hemming and hawing . " It 's not like cooring up a pair of horses to make a plow team , " Tomas said . " It 's a completely separate and independent decision for each family to make on its own . The O'Neills are in a different situation . Seamus has an older brother to help Fergus . Your hands are needed by me . " " I talked it over with Liam . He does n't want to go to school and he 's near as big as I am and could do most of my work and I promise to keep up my part and be no burden . " Tomas hardened . " You 'd no right to discuss the matter behind my back . "  | " It was n't behind your back , Daddy . Liam wants my chores . Half the time he 's hanging onto me to do them and he 's never so happy as when he 's up in the fields with you . " Tomas came off the wall slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conor could be and I reckoned he did n't want to make a command out of it . Conor 's plea seemed logical ... . " Well now , I 'm not against school , mind you , " Tomas said , seeming to want to act reasonable . " On the other hand , there 's only so much schooling you need and you more than likely know enough now . " " But I do n't , " Conor shot back . " All I know is catechisms . " " What the hell do you think they 'll teach you in that school ? " Tomas snapped , turning irate . " They know nothing about Ireland , they care nothing about Ireland . You 'll be learning English history , English laws , saluting the Union Jack and singing God Save the Queen . ' They wo n't so much as teach you the legend of Finn MacCool or The Cattle Raid of Cooley . ' There 's only one reason they 're putting up national schools and that 's because they 're after creating loyal British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded , " I want to learn how to read so 's I can read anything and I want to know about adding and multiplyingand what makes the heavens and the seas . I swear I 'll close my ears when they 're teaching British things . " " No . . . it 's no good , lad , it 's no good . " He tried to walk away but Conor was around in the front of him , blocking his path . " Ma said ... " " Your ma 's tongue is like a yard of vinegar . She could start a fight in an empty house . " He brushed past , then turned and softened a mite . " Conor , let me tell you something . You wo n't be needing all that education . Your bread is baked for life . You 'll be coming into the land . " Tomas had given Conor his most precious gift , the farm . Since the famine it had been illegal to divide farms into smaller farms . The lease or ownership had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not this inheritance was held by the parent as blackmail and competition between children could be fierce . As a rule the father would wait till the last possible instant before making a decision , usually when faced with his own death or the emigration of his sons . " I said the farm will be yours , " Tomas repeated . Conor remained motionless and wordless as well . In that instant I knew something terrible was taking place between them . " No matter , " Tomas said , covering his hurt , " you 'll wake up to/morrow knowing the importance of it and you 'll just sing with joy , lad . " He reached for his son as I had seen him do a hundred times , and waited for a return of his affection . None came . Tomas sagged back and seemed to age before my eyes . He continued down the path , then called back in a fit of anger . " You 've had enough of Father Cluny , too ! I do n't want any more goddamned celibates teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's public house . There were six of us Catholic kids from four villages at the first day of the national school and we found each other fast . As opening ceremonies were held in the yard under the Union Jack , we clung to one another trembling . A shiny new room greeted us , still smelling of paint and polish and filled with Protestant kids all starched and squeaking in their fine dress and shoes . We slunk off to the rear of the class and huddled together with a giantsizedpicture of Queen Victoria glowering at us , and awaited the doomsday appearance of the teacher . A tall , thin and seemingly delicate man stood before us like a bishop about to announce our damnation . I thought my heart was going to bounce out in the aisle as he tapped a ruler on the desk . " My name is Andrew Ingram , " he said . " I am from Scotland , Edinburgh . In a few days I 'll know all your names as well . I taught in a national school in Wales for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned there were openings here . I never forgot the beauty of Donegal from boyhood holidays and , being Scottish as well , I do love my fishing . " Well , I 'll tell you , he was obviously not a farmer and it seemed to me he was far too soft for the likes of Cromwell descendants , Ulstermen and croppies . Sure it was only a matter of minutes before he was being tested by Sandy Hanna , grandson of Luke , the biggest and toughest kid in the school . Sandy seemed more than adequate to withstand an ash-branch rodding from the frail Mr. Ingram as he screeched chalk over his slate that sounded like a bagpipe being tuned up . Mr. Ingram stopped talking amid the giggles and spotted Sandy Hanna . " You there . " Sandy ignored him and kept screeching away . Mr. Ingram steppedp231down into the classroom , into the aisle and over his desk . We dared not breathe , much less move . " What is your name ? " " Sandyhanna , " he answered like it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause for Sandy . " Sandy , you will kindly stand up when you are addressing the class or myself . " Sandy swaggered to his feet as tall as the teacher and half again as broad from pitching hay . " Tuck in your shirt , " the teacher said . He made a meaningless gesture at his shirttail , then folded his arms in defiance . Mr. Ingram smiled , kindly like . I was starting to get a hint that his soft manners were highly deceptive and , therefore , suspect . He turned away from Sandy and spoke to the class . " I am grateful for this opportunity so early in our relationship to explain a few simple rules . Once we all understand them , and you in particular , Sandy , we 're all going to get along just fine with no problems whatsoever . " Oh , he was a cool number and by this time even Sandy Hanna was getting the idea . Mr. Ingram walked slowly and deliberately to him . Sandy was getting nervous but he had made his bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up Sandy shifted from one foot to the other , gulping as he did . " I do n't believe in the ash rod or humiliations because I shouldlike to assume we are all going to behave like ladies and gentlemen . " He was puzzling us , this Mr. Ingram , but he had our undivided attention as well . Sandy had slowly been wilted like a man receiving condemnation from the priest before the entire village . " Sandy , you will kindly apologize to your classmates and assure me that you will behave . Otherwise . . . find your way home and return when you are ready to be a gentleman . " Confidentially , it was my opinion that Sandy wanted to apologize more than anything in the world but he had gotten himself in too deep . " I done nothing to apologize for , " he said halfheartedly . Mr. Ingram turned his back , went to his desk and sat down . " Leave the school , " he said in the same soft voice he had used throughout . Sandy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eyes burned on the pair of them as Mr. Ingram returned with that same deliberate calm . What we then saw was quicker than Father Lynch 's blackthorn stick . He snatched Sandy Hanna 's hand and in a motion worthy of Finn MacCool spun him around and had him in an arm lock , wrist lock and thumb lock with a single hand . Sandy screamed as Mr. Ingram shot him through the door like the mighty cannon of Athlone !  |p232We  were utterly , totally and completely mesmerized . It was all over for Sandy Hanna , who just stayed out in the yard and cried , then crawled back into the class begging not to be sent home , and then blurted out the most heart-wrenching apology you 'd ever want to hear . We never had much trouble with discipline after that . Each of us stood in turn and gave our names and village with Mr. Ingram 's eyes playing on the six shivering papists in the rear who had identified themselves in a dead giveaway with the names of O'Neill , O'Kane , O'Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more rule that each and every one of you is going to understand clearly , " he said . " We are a family here , all of us . " Then , leaving out the " 0 " and " Mac " from the beginning of our names , he seated us alphabetically . I do n't know what I can rightly say about my feelings for Mr. Ingram . In my short time of life and in most of my life afterward there always seemed to be someone who needed to beat us down , be it the Orangemen or land agents or gombeen men or Constabulary or our own priests . Mr. Andrew Ingram was the very first person in my life , if you do n't count Charles Stewart Parnell , to ever make me feel like an equal and very important human being . Most of the Protestant kids had had a fair measure of schooling . We were very far behind . There was no counting the extra hours Mr. Ingram spent to help us . Pretty soon all the girls were in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had much trouble again from the boys . He had earned his spurs in Wales teaching the kids of coal miners and they were n't exactly a soft bunch . A few months after his arrival there was some rumbling and grumbling against him from the Protestant ministers in the district and the Grand Masters of the Orange Lodges . They did n't like some of the books he was using because they were supposed to be filled with evil ideas . They also objected to the fact he was spending too much time on poetry and nature classes and not teaching enough English history and Protestant religion . Dirty rumors spread around that he had left Wales because he had gotten a girl into trouble . Other rumors had it that he liked young boys and that was why he was a teacher . A storm was rising and meetings were being called . he rode it out with his own kind of quiet dignity . The two times he was called before the school board he tied his inquisitors into knots by his range of knowledge and like/wise exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers . Mr. Ingram was extremely popular with the students and had taken on many of their personal problems . He had singlehandedly established a neutral sanctuary where compassion and reason prevailedin a place that knew little of each , and we were terrified that we were going to lose him . Then the Lord sent an angel in no less a form than Lady Caroline Hubble herself , who , with understatement , invited him to the Manor to tutor children of some of the foreign workmen . After it became known that Mr. Ingram attended plays and concerts in the Long Hall and gave a poetry reading there himself , opposition to him disappeared . . . thank God . I remembered everything I was taught in the national school because I had to learn it once for myself , then teach it to Conor . He waited for me every day at the crossroad and while things were still fresh in my mind we would hide out in the old Norman keep and go over the day 's work . I would tell him about the goings on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to know almost all of the kids from my description . After a time Conor waited for me a bit farther down the road at Josiah Lambe 's blacksmith shop . The smithy was a source of wondermentwith its magic pools of fire silhouetting the brawny Mr. Lambe as he hammered and the sparks flew in the execution of highly secret formulas passed on by the fairies . In village life the blacksmith was second in importance only to the priest . Mr. Lambe could certainly be that important except he was a Protestant . The Upper Village had lost its own blacksmithto emigration during the famine . At that time Josiah Lambe 's father , who did the smithing for the Protestants , took on work for the Catholics as well . By unwritten code he always hired a Catholic as his assistant and another as his apprentice and thereby continued to work for both communities . He ran Conor away from the shop twenty times but Conor returneda twenty-first and that happened to be the very day his apprenticetook a job as assistant to the blacksmith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treadle on the double bellows and a week later Conor was making nails . He was so excited you would have thought he had given birth to them , personally.  | " These are roseheads in this bin , " he said , " and these are tenderhooksand horseshoe nails here , and scuppers . " My , he was beaming . I praised him forcefully after intimate examination of his work . Of course I had seen all these nails before but not made by Conor . Tomas did n't like it , but from a practical standpoint it was hard for him to object . Liam was capable of doing a full day 's work in the fields and the money Conor began to earn was too important for the family to pass up so he eased into being Mr. Lambe 's new apprentice . Of a day late in the autumn we had a holiday from school . Nota holiday after a saint or even something like Christmas or an English holiday but a holiday sacred to the Ulster Protestant alone . I met Conor at the forge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliveries . When the last was done Conor took the horse to Mr. Lambe 's house , stabled it and we walked back toward the Upper Village . As we reached the outskirts of town we heard sounds of powerfulhymn singing coming from the Presbyterian church . " The Prods arc having a thanksgiving for their harvest , " I said knowingly , " that 's why school is closed . " " What are they thanking for ? " Conor asked . " I 'm not quite sure I know . " " I do n't get it . You know how nervous our daddies and mas get at late harvest , what with the rents due and winter coming . " I shrugged . " Mr. Ingram just did n't explain it . " " Listen to them singing , would you ? It 's queer if you ask me . Come on , let 's have a look . " " Oh , Jaysus , no , " I said , backing away . " The last time we got into a Protestant church , we like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , tippy-toeing up the steps . After assuring myself escape routes were available and we could make a clean getaway , I followed to the front window and we stared in like two goats peering through a hedge . The sight inside made me gasp . Both sides of the altar were piled high with loaves of bread and sheaves of corn . There were turnips and cabbages and great pumpkins and carrots and parsnips and onions all shiny from scrubbing and baskets of nuts in fancy designs . There were big juicy apples and tomatoes and berries and all kinds of food we rarely saw and never ate . Arrayed below the altar was a stuffed pig , lambs and turkeys fancy dressed for a feast . The preacher had his arms spread and was praising God for the bountiful harvest and they sang out again about their rejoicing . " Let 's go , " Conor said abruptly  |p235He  shoved his hands in his pockets and walked to the road , retaininghis fierce silence indicating he was deep in thought or hurting or both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ventured . " Like hell , it 's the land they stole that 's better . " I walked about a half step behind until we came to the schoolhouse . Conor stopped . His eyes watered and the muscles of his face quivered from tightly clenched teeth . " I think you 'd better blurt it out , " I said . " Blurt nothing . " " It 's sticking out all over you , Conor , and I do n't want to be spending the day with you if you 're going to be mad all the time . " " Aw , go to hell . " " Hey , Conor , I know a secret way into the school , " I said . Actually it was n't so secret because Mr. Ingram always kept the back door unlocked . Conor followed me in tentatively , his eyes hungering as he played them over the desks and blackboard all filled with arithmetic problems . " Here 's where I sit , " I said , " and right next to me is that girl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes and all those things to eat . " Conor ran his hand over the top of my desk , then slid into my seat and straightened himself , folding his hands as though Mr. Ingram were going to call on him . " Hello there . " Conor jumped up startled as Mr. Ingram entered from his side office . " Ah , a good day to you , Mr. Ingram , " I said . " We was just passing by and my very closest friend Conor Larkin wanted to see my desk . " " Hello , Conor . I 'm Andrew Ingram . " Conor shook his hand suspiciously . Mr. Ingram did n't have to ask why he was n't attending school . He had already been to all the priests in the district to urge them to urge their parishioners to send more kids but met with little success . " Conor reads and writes , " I said proudly . " I 'm glad to hear that , " Mr. Ingram answered . " Seamus has been teaching me . " " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of my star pupils . He 'll be after my job soon . " " Not to worry about that , Mr. Ingram , " I said . " I 'm only doing this because Conor is my best friend . "  | " I 'm very pleased , Seamus . One of the best things that can happen to a teacher is to produce his own missionaries . Is there any chance of you coming to school , Conor ? " " I 'm afraid I 'm too busy . You see , I 'm the apprentice for Mr. Lambe and I work for my daddy as well . Besides , my daddy does n't fancy the school . . . . " I tried to poke Conor to be quiet but he went on . . . . " He says you do n't teach anything really Irish here . " " I see , " Mr. Ingram answered , showing no irritation . Even though Conor was trying to walk taller than he was , he could n't help but look at the bookshelves which ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Sight of them ate away at his show of pride , for his desire was unbearably apparent . " Do you suppose I could lend you a book , Conor ? " " Which one ? " " Well , let 's see here . Perhaps we can find something Irish , even in the Queen 's realm . Here 's one . The Bardic Tradition of the Middle Irish Period . " " What 's it about ? " " I 'm sorry , I had the idea you knew all about Ireland . This is about the Irish court poets during the Middle Ages . I think that before one gets his teeth into the real red-blooded revolutionaries a foundation should be built on earlier Irish history . It is quite a history , you know . Do you think you 'd like to take a try at it . . . it 's not too difficult . " " It might be all right , " Conor said as he accepted the book suspiciously . " I 'll be sure to bring it back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you do return it , help yourself to another one . Just leave a note on my desk . " The door was open indeed ! Conor walked down the rows of volumesfeasting his eyes on the wonderland of it although he could n't make out half the titles . He kept looking like he was in a dream , his hand irresistibly drawn to touching the books ' spines . " If you can spare the time , " Mr. Ingram said , " oh , say an hour a week , you could stop by after school hours and the two of us can chat about what you 're reading . Sometimes , when you 're doing it by yourself , it can become complex and confusing and could stand a bit of explaining . " " I might . " " In that way I can also tell if Seamus is keeping your lessons up and maybe I can work out a few assignments for you . "  |p237Conor  walked to the door but could not quite leave . He came back to Mr. Ingram and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift that had been bestowed . " I want to thank you very much , " he said finally , then turned and ran out . Conor Larkin always had magic in his hands . Since I could rememberhe was making toys of straw for the village children and straw costumes for weddings and celebrations and fine wood carvings and St. Brigid 's crosses to ward off evil spirits and other omens to keep the home and byre safe from fire , fairies and ravagement . He made fishing lines and nets of horsehair tail and butterfly cages and was near as good as Tomas at repairing furniture and mending farm tools . All of this talent leaped to life at Mr. Lambe 's forge . Not only was he forging plowshares , spades , hinges and doing farrier work with horses , he was soon on advanced wheelwrighting and tinkering with fancy decorations that had Mr. Lambe scratching his head . Handles for hearth tools and hearth cranes took on beautiful scroll patterns and his trivets could n't be matched , even in Derry . Everything that Conor made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who received a gift of utensils or candlesticks for his birthday . Conor did not stand at the anvil and bang away like Mr. Lambe . He moved about it in the graceful manner of the master dancersof Inishowen in flight and he drew the metal out and twisted it like an artist at a canvas or a poet talking to the bluebird . It was to the everlasting glory of Josiah Lambe to encourage Conor even though the apprentice was catching up to the master . As I watched him blossom in the blacksmith shop , I began to realizehe did n't really want to come into the Larkin farm . Conor would never come right out and say it in so many words for that would hurt spare minute was spent in study . On the other hand , Liam was ever at Tomas ' side in the fields , slaning turf at the bog , plowing , digging the lazy beds for the potatoes . Liam Larkin had the land in his soul but Tomas was unable to see it for his love of Conor . What seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dearly as they ever had but they barely spoke to one another . Here were two strong people almost deliberately hurting one another through silence and moving toward that point where there could be no turning back.  |p238Mr  . Ingram asked everyone who had a relative who had emigrated from Ireland to raise his hand . Everyone in the class did . Mainly , the relatives were in America . Us six Catholic kids had kin living in large cities like Boston and Baltimore . The Protestantsmostly emigrated years before and had spread all over America and many into Canada . For our most important term assignment , Mr. Ingram had us write a long and detailed letter or story to a relativeand tell them about ourselves . I ca n't recall my brother Eamon , who had left before I was old enough to get to know him . The one photograph we had was of himtogether with a bunch of firemen on a picnic in the park and we could hardly make him out . We did n't hear from him often , maybe once a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him changing his name from Eamon to the American version of Ed . Of course there was always a big package at Christmas and , when my grandfar died , Ed sent money for a fine tombstone as was the custom . You could tell from the graveyard at St. Columba 's who had relatives in America . I remember sitting near the fire trying to think of how to start my letter and looking at my ma . I realized for the first time how old she was getting . I watched her working kind of bent over a little , for she did n't walk real straight any longer . She smoored the fire constantly to keep it alive and appease the fairies , for it is said that when the fire dies the house will soon be falling down . During the famine , neighbors would smoor the fires in the homes of those who had emigrated so it would be warm when they ended their exile and returned to Ireland . Of course they never did come back and the fires died out and the cottages came tumbling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women of Ballyutogue aged before their time . Endless chores in the house and out in the fields and byre kept them laboring like slaves from morning till night . They were the keepers of the customs , bringing their own new lives into the world and , in the case of my ma , hundreds of other wanes . When I asked her how many babies she had midwifed , she gave me her half-toothless smile and said , " Sure I ca n't count that high . I should have had a son in school like yourself when I started and then I 'd know . "  |p239There  were four-legged babies , too , the new animals in the byre and the driving of the cows past the fire for luck and the hanging of St. Brigid 's crosses and rowan sprigs to ward off evil spirits and making certain a cricket was put in the handle of a scythe and mixing ashes with the new seed for luck . Maybe they could n't read and write and count so high but they surely had to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with all the old beliefs and make new lives and keep the old ones going . ' When evening came and the men would be having at their jug at the shebeen or playing glink , the women would gather in a cottage and sit around the fire with a single candle or lantern and do the fancy lacework on the linen for his lordship 's factory . Their eyes were always red-rimmed from the strain but the few pence they earned were sorely needed . With the hours they worked and having the yearly baby , it was small wonder the grayness came and the teeth were lost and the stoop of weariness invaded long before its rightful time . There was little joy for these women . Even the joy that one felt as a haughty young girl being courted , and the joy of the moment of marriage , fled too soon . The only path open was to plunge deeper into the fairy tales of their faith to keep them going , for it held out a promise of the hereafterand the long rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not submerge themselves into the fantasy of Jesus and Mary often went the way of madness . When the last crop was in and the rents paid , there was an idle time , for our land was far too poor to work in the winter months . It was needed to grass over to feed the cattle and sheep . Winters were the time when the babies were made and the wee wanes were harvestedthe next year with the potatoes . There were small respites during those long stormy winter days and nights , the revelry of a new marriage that matched the revelry of the wake . The bride went through a mock kidnap by her husband , who rode in gallantly on horseback and swept her off , and the invasion of straw boys who broke into the merrymaking disguised as washed-up seamen from a shipwreck . But the marriage song soon dimmed with the coming of the first baby and faded to nothingness and everlastingmonotony with the second and the third and the fourth . But on they came , for to stop giving birth meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . Us younger ones had a fortnightly ceilidhe of village dancing andp240singing at the Norman keep . Half the lads of our village could sing in any angel 's choir and the other half was just as talented at the pipes . Father Lynch laid down stringent restrictions on all gatherings where both sexes would be present and hovered about to make certainthat God 's will was imposed . But try as he might , he could n't entirely , one hundred per cent keep the Devil away . Other gatherings of a more vigorous nature took place at the shebeen and public house where the songs and stories reeked of insurrectionand poets went into gentle combat . The Inishowen weather of storms within storms , and storms in between storms , made it more difficult on the men , who were idler than the women . Tomas Larkin had his hands full to keep family feuds from flaring as tempers grew short . Conor and I alone seemed to fare well . I was as happy in Mr. Ingram 's class as Conor was at Mr. Lambe 's forge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and making new ones , as well as filling the order for the stone quarry . Spring always seemed to rescue Ballyutogue just in time . By the first of March the men were eager and tramping about the infields and outfields of the rundale , poking around to see if the ground was firm enough and always casting a weather eye toward the lough and praying it would be kindly . It indicated good luck if we turned the earth on St. Patrick 's Day with the first ridge of potatoes planted by Good Friday . Tomas Larkin pretty much made the decisions in organizingcommunal work and marrowing together the labor pools . On his word , the year 's labor began . " In the name of God , " he 'd say , spitting into the wind and throwing up some hay to ward off the storms , then turn the horses to the lucky side and plow the first row . Tomas , my daddy and my brother , Colm , and later Liam , would take up their slanes , long thin spades , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run water up to them . The lazy beds were dug by hand , a series of trenches and ridges designed to get full use of the slope of the hill but caring for the drainage to prevent rotting while at the same time making certain the rains carried down dead grass and humus as fertilizer . No plow could match a man 's work andevery lazy bed showed a slightly different individuality and technique . With the lazy bed in , I 'd gugger with my ma as Finola guggered with Brigid . It was women 's and kids ' work . I was too young for the slane and getting just old enough to be embarrassed working with the women . The gugger itself was an archaic sod-busting woodenp241tool that allowed seeds to be dropped into the holes . The women would gugger and the kids come up behind them , covering the holes with small forks . Four seeds in the hole , One for the rook , One for the crow , One for to rot , And one for to grow . The crops followed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when summer was on us the youngest boys of the family went up to the mountains to shepherd . Mairead and Finola kept close watch on that mystical animal , the pig , who alone in all the world was gifted by the fairies with an ability to see the wind . The pig was the gentleman who paid the rent , and his weight , welfare and size of litter were of utmost concern . With the early crops in , the men would then move up to the bogs to clamp turf during the dry months starting in May , cutting and drying it and sharecropping enough for our own use . This time of year brought an annual tension . The next month was June and the beginning of the blue months , where all our superstitions and prayers were put into play . Food and fodder this time of year would be getting low . As July turned , a communal breath was held . On the Twelfth of July , the Orange celebration , there would be the first cutting of the hay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oats in that order . In blessed October the potatoes were lifted and , although the famine was thirty-five years behind us , no one ever forgot . If they were healthy after a week , we allowed ourselves an outbreak of relief . Shortly thereafter , many of the men would be droving sheep and cattle to Derry , then crossing the water to find dock jobs in Liverpoolor other menial labor in England . If all had gone well , if natural disaster had not struck , if surplus members of the family married or emigrated or moved to the city , if food and fodder held during the blue months and terrible loans did n't have to be made , the farmer would be able to make it for another year . The thinline of survival was so delicate it did n't really require a major disaster to wipe us out but the series of minor ones that never failed to come : loss of a few head , sickness , partial crop damage or some other unexpected assault on our meager resources which always putp242us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time any of us really got caught up was on that final visit to St. Columba 's graveyard . When the Rankins left the estate and it went under direct control of Viscount Coleraine , there was a feeling that a great burden had been lifted . We were dead wrong , of course . Flax had been a good crop for us , grown communally in several of the larger outfields . Then the word was given by Luke Hannathat the Hubbies would no longer buy because they were putting in their own vast acreage , and the Protestants would supply the balance . He wanted us to grass over our flax land and increase our herds , but in the transition the loss of revenue would be catastrophic . Moreover , cattle was a lot riskier than flax . Viscount Coleraine had n't been in the business long enough to see the effects of a boycott . As the old rumbles of discontent and anger spread around the earldom , Kevin O'Garvey , speaking for the Land League , was able to impress on his lordship that other means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his lordship 's credit , he smelled trouble and immediately got government funds for road projects and doubled the jobs at the stone quarry , then finally gave the Upper Village a contract to harvest and prepare his flax fields . Jaysus b'Jaysus , it was filthy , loathsome , disgusting work . The stalks had to be pulled from the ground by hand with us kids acting as gleaners to gather up what the main body of men passed over . At the end of a day you 'd be so stooped it would take an hour to be able to stand straight . After tying the stalks into bundles , we set it in artificial pools or dams to decay the cores . It remained in the water for a fortnight and , as the cores rotted , it set up a stink that would chase a banshee across the Irish Sea . Then came the very job for the kids that convinced me that I 'd never make a farmer . We had to get into that putrid , rancid , stinking pool which had turned slimy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread them by hand to dry . It was worse than saying the rosary . The men bundled it into stooks for further drying and built up two-story huts awaiting Luke Hanna 's carts from the mill to collect it for spinning , weaving and bleaching into linen . I merely mentioned the flax harvest because of the smell which I recall so vividly.  |p243There  were holy gatherings and traditional holidays during which we 'd have a chance to travel away from the gimlet eyes of Father Lynch and dance complete with touching your partner closely and game and bet and drink and court and brawl . There were pilgrimages to holy wells and holy beds but I did n't fancy that too much , although our mothers took them seriously and forced us to go along sometimes . St. Brigid and St. Columba were very dominant in Donegal but , as in the rest of Ireland , St. Patrick was by far the most important . Daddo Friel said that some of the rituals we practiced as Catholics were so old they were really begun by the Druid priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Mountain where the worshipers climbed one of the highest peaks in Ireland barefooted . Only three people in Ballyutogue had ever made that great journey to County Mayo , Finola Larkin being one of them and , as everyone knew , was rewarded by the birth of Conor because of it . Conor and I would be walking on air the morning of the monthly trading fair which was usually held on a saint 's day . At gathering day at Muff or Moville or Buncrana or Culdaff we 'd enter the grounds as cocky as big swells from Derry . There would be stalls of used clothing from Scotland and kitchen and farm tools and boys looking for fights and girls , and sometimes horse racing and illegal cock fights and wandering troupes of bards and actors and ballad singers and storytellers and piles of cloth and creels and toys and straw men plying their gambling games . Conor and I always had one important transaction at the fair like buying a pair of secondhand shoes . We 'd fill our pockets with omens on gathering day in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinker and cross his palm with copper and have our fortune told complete with dire prophecies . They told us what to look for and what to stay away from . Tinkers who were n't soothsaying were plying their art as horse traders while their wives and kids swarmed the grounds begging . Daddo Friel told Conor and me that the tinkers were not real genuine gypsies but our own Irish folk who had taken to the road generations ago after their houses were tumbled or after the defeats of the risings or from the famine . Once each year they 'd camp their wagons at the crossroad near the hanging tree . We gave them safe lodging and in turn they 'd hardly steal a thing . In Ballyutogue we felt it was good luck to be kind to them . They did the year 's whitesmithingof tin and sheet metal arts , repaired the poteen stillsp244and moved along . It was a dirty life they lived . Dr. Ian Cruikshank had an annual Tinker Day in which he 'd examine the lot of them at no cost whatsoever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fair day . All the family and clan feuds which had built up on gathering day were apt to explode . As the crowds thickened , so did the Constabulary . Peacemakers like Tomas Larkin were on constant call . Sometimes it did no good at all and the better brawls supplied fodder for next winter 's conversationat the shebeen . Trading on fair day would be fierce . In the spring we were looking for a good horse and the women were after cloth from the earnings of their egg money . In late spring cattle was sold along with the first wool shearings in order to make the first of two rent payments . The autumn fairs were even more crucial . To have a prize cow or sheep could mean the difference between a marginal year or a highly successful one . There was the final auction of beef that was n't under contract to his lordship and hiring ourselves out as drovers to move the animals to port in order to meet the year 's second rent payment in late October . I remember May Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the cuckoo which would foretell a good corn harvest and Halloween , the grandest of them all , for the potatoes were up , the rent was paid and the whole countryside was alive with banshees and fairies and ghosts and headless horsemen . And then winter would come again . Of all the things I remember of Ballyutogue , nothing warms my heart more than an annual event that came into being because of the famine . In those blue months of midsummer when we waited for the first harvest , it was quite possible to go hungry . After the famine Kilty Larkin made a successful negotiation with the Hubbies for some of the wrack rights in the lough . The entire village  --  men , women and children  --  moved down to the coast and set up primitive housing in an abandoned fishing village along the shore . Daddo Friel told us that before the famine the seaweed harvesters would work naked , which was both practical and comfortable . However , the good priests took over blessing this enterprise andp245naturally we had to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our feet . As Conor and I grew older we were allowed to use the knives , scythes and specially sharpened hoes . Yards upon yards of coiled rope were readied on the shore . When low tide came we moved out in curraghs to the offshore kelp beds towing a raft behind every two boats . As they had worked their fields side by side all their lives , Tomas and Fergus labored in adjoining curraghs to cut loose and pile kelp on the raft . Colm worked with Daddy , and Liam , Conor and me did a man-size job between the three of us alongside Tomas . Soon the rafts would be running back and forth to be beached . The piles of seaweed were tied , then dragged by hand over the soft sand to firmer ground where the cart wheels would n't sink under the weight . Carts and ass creels were loaded and the weed carried to a long stone wall to be shaken out and laid over to dry . Before Kilty became infirm , he was in charge of that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drying kelp , picking out thousands of trapped cockles and mussels , and separated the seaweedby its variety and use . At the same time my ma and Finola and Brigid waded out into waist-deep water to harvest kelp that had been tossed up by the storms , cutting it loose and carrying it back and forth with all they could hold in their arms . If low tide came during the night , everyone worked by lantern light . When the shoreside harvest was completed and the sea calm , we 'd go out with our daddies as part of sixteen-curragh teams into the deeper water and cut loose an entire bed and drag it ashore like a waterlogged whale . Part of the wrack rights included taking shellfish . Throughout the night , parties of boys and girls dug for clams and scallops and oysters and chipped mussels off the rocks . This was the part Conor and I liked best because we 'd choose our girls weeks in advance . There was Alanna one year , she was the first I ever kissed , and Lissy .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Malley , who did about everything , so I even shared her with Conor . Father Lynch and Father Cluny tried to watch the clam digs but we had perfectedingenious methods of decoying them up blind alleys . As they observed us , we observed them and had so refined our bird call signals , you could n't tell most of us from a robin . The digs werep246the best part of the wracking but confessions went on afterward for weeks . Separating the kelp was a great and messy chore . Some of it was used for animal fodder , some for making iodine and some for fertilizer . There was edible seaweed that my ma mixed with potatoes and another type that could be jellied to thicken the milk and butter . Oily fires smoked along the coast to bum the weed down and boil it for use in making soap and bleach , and yet other kelp was watered down to preserve the shellfish . Shells were crushed and made into whitewash . A few weeks after the wracking was done our cottages gleamed with new coats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who had survived the famine still had the bitter taste of seaweed and shellfish in their mouths . Loathing famine food was traditional and remained with us all our lives but in the blue months it was the difference between a full or empty belly . Besides , not having lived through the famine , I would n't mind dying with the smell filling my nostrils that came from the great cauldrons of boiling cockles . The kelp was slimy and the water dirty and sticky and the stink from the burning as bad as rotting flax . It was the lowest kind of croppy work , yet recalling the nights under the lanterns and sleeping on the sand with the girls , it was also our first step into the world of men and women in love . We did so many things together in Ballyutogue . We prayed together and farmed together . The joy at birth , the tears of weddings and the wailings of anguish at death were all a communal affair . But nothing again in my life was as dear as the harvesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my brother Ed . I know he had experienced it all when he was a kid , but seeing as he had been in America so long , he may have forgotten and I thought he might like to remember . My brother Ed wrote he was very happy to receive my letter and proud I was getting an education . He said it was very important , particularly if I ever intended emigrating . Ed asked me for more letters and in the last paragraph offered to sendp247me books from America . Well , that was like putting poteen before the village drunk because books were scarce as winter sun . Conor and I discussed the matter heavily because receiving the kind of books we hungered after would n't be all that easy . As soon as a package arrived from America everyone in the village knew about it . It would take about ten minutes for Father Lynch to come nosing around . In my case he would demand to see the books , take them , burn them and preach a damnation on Sunday . Conor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't exactly like the idea but decided to go along with me because the bait of books was too tempting . He visited with Mr. Ingram regularly once a fortnight and had already read some of the early Irish writers like Edmund Burke on the French Revolution and Oliver Goldsmith and Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels . In fact , Conor could just about outread anyone except Mr. Ingram . We went to the school at a time we knew he would be there alone and sure enough he was in his office correcting papers . He smiled and said , " Hello , lads , " and shoved his work aside . " What 's the occasion ? " " An extremely important matter , sir , " I answered , handing him the letter from Ed . " Concerning the last paragraph . " " Well , well , books from America . That is exciting . You 'll be coming into great wealth , Seamus . " " Aye , and we 'll be needing your help to suggest what he ought to send , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , there 's a slight problem , " I said . " If I get a package , Father Lynch will be knocking at the door no sooner than it arrives . " " There 's almost nothing we 're allowed to read , " Conor said . " I see . Well then , we 'd better figure out a way to get around that , " Mr. Ingram said , smiling , " . . . unless you 've already thought of something . " Both of us shifted about , scratching our heads sincerely , trying to make the best of our limited abilities as liars . " Ca n't imagine how , " I said . " Well now , let me see . How about if Ed sends the books to me ? " Conor and I beamed on cue . " Oh , that 's a grand idea , why did n't I think of it ? " I said . " But we would n't want you to get into any trouble , " I added quickly.  | " What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father Lynch will go into a fury if he ever finds out , " Conor said . " Seems I 've alienated every Protestant minister in the district . I might as well make it unanimous , " he said . Conor was acting strange all the way down to the school and I had a feeling he was going to botch things up . " No , we ca n't do it , " he said . " If Father Lynch finds out he 'll never let another kid come to the school again and we ca n't be responsible for something like that . " " I have to disagree with you , Conor , " Mr. Ingram answered . " If he does that it 's his responsibility and not yours . " " Nae , it would be wrong , " Conor said . " The only thing wrong is submitting to tyranny . You 've a right to inquire into anything you want to . " " No , I do n't . " " You do . You were born with it , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another problem , " Conor said . " If the Orangemen find out , they 'll turn you out of here . " " Seems like we have an awful lot of problems , " Andrew Ingram answered . " Fortunately they do n't have the slightest idea of what exists inside of a book cover . I suspect you want books on Ireland . " Conor and I exchanged glances . " As a matter of fact . . . " I said , with my voice squealing clear off the track . He just sort of leaned back in his chair , grinning . " You boys would n't be thinking in terms of a little insurrectionist literature ? " " Oh no , sir , no , sir , not at all , sir , " I said . " That 's exactly what we want , " Conor corrected . " Done , " Mr. Ingram said . I guess we must have just stood there gawking . Mr. Ingram returned to correcting his papers , then looked up at us . " Is there anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then kindly draw the door to on your way out . " Entering into a dire conspiracy with us , Mr. Ingram personally wrote to Ed , and in late spring four treasured books arrived from America , including the autobiography of Theobald Wolfe Tone , as well as The Rising of the Moon , a volume of revolutionary songs and readings.  |p249Tomas  had had a small streak of bad luck with crops and several litters of pigs pinching the family finances so that Conor 's job at the forge was all the more important . Nonetheless , his concern over Conor 's drifting from the land and the home deepened . Liam was doing almost all of his chores now , so that between the forge and keeping his face in a book , breaking his eyes by candlelight , Conor was becoming like a stranger in the house . It was traditional that the youngest son ( being Liam ) go up into the mountains to shepherd during the summer while the oldest worked with the father . A problem was in the making and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm keeping Liam on the farm with me , " he announced abruptly . " Conor , you 're to go up to the booley house with the livestock . " Conor was stunned . " But why ! " " Because you 've proved yourself less than useless around here . " " But , Daddy , what about my job at the forge ! " " I 've spoken to Mr. Lambe . He 'll take you back on a part-time basis provided you come down from the pasture remembering you 're a farmer first . Otherwise , forget about being a blacksmith altogether . " Oh , Tomas was being hard like I 'd never seen him . It was obvious that Conor was being sent to purgatory as punishment . There could be no doubt at all that his daddy 's words were final . He just stood there pale , his world all crashed down on him with the threat of losing his job as well . Tomas had calculated it was frightening enough to snap him back into line . " Is it all clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing his way from the table and leaving the cottage . I caught him down the road and spun him around . " Let me go , " he snapped . " Do n't you see it ! " I cried . " I see it all right . I see what he 's trying to do . " " Oh , Conor , my God , sometimes I think you 're stupid as an Orangeman . Look , man , here we are with four new books plus the pickings of Mr. Ingram 's entire library and a whole summer up at the booley house by ourselves . We can read our arses off with nobody to bother us and no secret hiding places ! " " Oh , Jaysus , runt , I never thought about that ! " He flung his arms around me , nearly knocking my head to the ground . " Let 's get down to Mr. Ingram in the morning and pick the rest of the books ! "  |p250We  were the happiest two kids on Inishowen when we packed the ass cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our books were well hidden , for Tomas would be seeing us up to the booley house . Conor and Tomas rode the nags out of Ballyutogue , droving the sheep and cows with the dogs scampering about in a tight circle . I brought up the rear in the cart . We moved inland , due west , past the thick belt of high bogs in country that changed from rolling hills to mountains . It would take us three days if all went well . I do n't believe Tomas and Conor exchanged a dozen words till the third day when we skirted the foothills of Crocknamaddy and began to rise toward the booley house , which sat in a saddle between Slieve Sneigh and Slieve Main at a height of fifteen hundred feet . Our party climbed under the watchful escort of circling sparrow hawks and golden eagles . The booley house rested in the shade of a fine grove of larch before a stream which found its way down from Slieve Sneigh . It was a wee circular affair , about eighteen feet in diameter , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covered by a sod roof . A souterrain adjoined the booley house for storage . We chased out the nesting bats , then unloaded bedding , pots and pans , a churn , tools , some traps and fishing gear , candles , some sacks of potatoes , dried beans and oats . There was always enough turf left from the previous year to get a new fire started and keep it smoored until we could clamp and dry another batch . While Tomas made the fire , Conor and I paced off a hundred and seventy-four paces parallel to the stream , which led into a thick growth of gorse , and we shoveled to uncover a cache of arms . All the weapons were found clean and dry , well wrapped and greased . I selected a shotgun and Conor , who was the better marksman , chose a small-caliber rifle . We rewrapped the rest of the arms with great care and set them back into the hiding place . As it turned dark we hobbled the horses , cleaned up our weapons , ate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow with us . The bent grass was thick and mixed with wildflowers . Along the stream clumps of bracken , gorse and young heather would be fine for feeding the sheep . A number of still ponds which had been dug by hand and renewed each year seemed to be running full with fish . A dozen or more dilapidated buildings were interspersed about thep251meadow . When we were wee wanes Daddo Friel told us these were homes of fairies who had been angels once and were evicted from heaven for their pranks . Later , when we were growing , he told us it was most likely an encampment of Finn MacCool and later yet he identified them as ruins from Viking invasions . More than likely they were nothing but old booley houses of our ancestors . Our booley house was in fine condition , needing but a few days ' work , mostly sod scraws for the roof . Conor and I went to a small surface bog nearby and examined it . It was very soggy so we reckoned our first major chore after repairing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drying . When we returned , Tomas had the horses tethered behind the ass cart ready to return to Ballyutogue . As we went to say good-by to him , we could see his face straining in leashed anger . All our books , the four from America and four from Mr. Ingram , were in plain sight inside the cart . We stared at them in horror ! " Did you think that after fifty years as a farmer I could n't tell the weight of a sack of beans ? " he said , revealing their hiding place . The both of us were too scared to defend our shattered world for the moment . " Why did you try to do this behind my back ? " Conor became calm as he always did when the ground got muddy . " I thought you would n't understand , " he said . " I understand that your head 's out there in the stars when there 's enough troubles right down here . " " Maybe out there is the only place to find the answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road is going to carry you , Conor ? It never took any of us any place but to the hanging tree . You 're digging with the wrong foot , boy , and you 're making yourself a hell on earth . You 'd better spend your time up here thinking about a lot of things before you come back . " Tomas stepped up to the cart seat , slapped the donkey on the rump and it rolled . Conor dashed around and grabbed the bridle . " When you get home , you be sending Liam back here because I 'll be gone ! " Tomas was down in an instant . The back of his hand slammed into Conor 's face , knocking him sprawling to the ground . I ran to Conor and laid over him so he would n't be hit again with Tomas towering over us raging and Conor looking up , his mouth and nose spurting blood . I swear that one was just as fearful as the other . Tomas Larkin broke first . He walked back to the cart , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books out to the ground . " Daddy ! " Conor cried , running to his father and flinging his arms around him . Only this time it was Tomas who stood like stone , taking his son 's arms away from him and getting into the cart . " Make sure you 've got a kill before you shoot . Do n't use up all your ammunition the first week . I 'll see you in the autumn . " And then he was gone . After repairing the booley house and clamping turf , we set in our food supply . There would be a never ending supply of fresh milk from the herd , which we could sour or churn to mix with potatoes as well as a crude cheese made from sheep 's milk . We foraged like stone age settlers , gathering sacks of mushrooms which grew wild in the damp earth beneath the conifer stands . Three or four different varieties of heath berries were worth eating when mixed with cream , and thousands of edible snails inhabited the edges of the ponds . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck of the fish . Trout and roach were hitting up to two feet long . Our first catches were filleted and salted for the days when they would n't be biting and the bones and guts were left in the sun to draw maggots for bait . Conor set snares for hare and red squirrel which we also hunted by gun with some luck . With the souterrain stocking up , we settled down with our books in the company of jackdaws , magpies and ravens happily scavenging the camp , keeping it clean and getting friendlier every day so 's they 'd soon be eating out of our hands . At daybreak we 'd rush to get our chores done so we could read . As it turned to summer the light stayed longer and longer . We 'd nap here and there between hunting and fishing and milking , leaving time for talking during the dark hours in order to save on candles . I guess there was n't much we did n't talk about that summer . The books had fired us to dreaming and longing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the next we 'd travel to mystical lands beyond Ballyutogue . Occasionally we 'd get company from those ever migrating tinkers or other shepherds in the lower pastures . Stray fugitives on the run sought a day 's respite now and again . None were the desperatep253sort and harboring was common . We were safe with our dogs and arms and rarely did a fugitive do anything harmful , for it would destroy an ancient custom of sanctuary . They 'd always represent themselves as fighters for Irish liberty who had fallen from grace for a crime against the Crown , though God only knew what they were really wanted for . We 'd feed them , let them rest the day , then move them along to the next set of safe booley houses at Crocknamaddy . There was a major subject of growing interest concerning matters of a sexual nature . The one thing we would miss would be the wracking harvest this particular year as both of us had ideas of advancing our knowledge with Brendt O'Malley . There was so much we did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for books on the subject . Conor reckoned he would be of an open mind on the matter . It must have been around Midsummer 's Night when he came because it was light nearly all the time and we were reading so much we spent half the days dozing at our fishing lines . The dogs yapped , alerting us to strangers . We took observation positions and spotted two horsemen on the horizon trailing a pair of donkeys loaded with provisions . As they came into closer view our hearts jumped with joy ! Sure it was Andrew Ingram on one of the horses and we dashed out to greet him . To our utter astonishmentthe rider on the second horse was a lady . We were introduced to Miss Enid Lockhart , who was a teacher herself in the national school in Muff . Quickly concealing our amazement , we shook her hand , pretending that her being there was nothing at all . Mr. Ingram said he was looking for a few days of good fishing . Was he ever in luck ! A booley house about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We raced off to fix it up for him and his lady friend , which we did in short order . Then , as we helped them unpack , Mr. Ingram gave us the most magnificent surprise of our lives in the form of six more books . I will never forget them : The Confederate Chieftains , after the rising of 1641 , and The History of Ireland by John Mitchel and The History of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 . There was The Life and Times of Daniel O'Connell and The Life of Lord Edward Fitzgerald by Thomas Moore . The last book was really for Conor , for he trembled all over when he read the title . It was an English translation of the great Celtic epic , The Cattle Raid of Cooley , part of the Fenian tales of Finn MacCool , Queen Maevep254and Cuchullain , a most pulsating drama also known as the Irish Odyssey , and the most magnificent words to have been born from Ulster . " Well , " said Mr. Ingram , seeing great white spots from our bulging eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems that there is a full-blooded Fenian bookstore in Philadelphia which your brother Ed has discovered . The Cattle Raid is my own present from Dublin . " We were still too shocked to speak as he turned his sack over , tumbling out two notebooks and a dozen pencils . " It might be a good idea to put some thoughts down as you go along . Miss Enid will be happy to show you how to make a proper outline . " I finally got around to thanking him but Conor remained in a euphoric stupor . He took my shotgun and said he would be back in a while , and took off over the meadow with the dogs . He returned after a time holding up a handsome-sized ring-necked pheasant . It was his special way of thanking Mr. Ingram . " I knew she was there , " Conor said excitedly . " I spotted the nest a time back and was waiting for a special occasion . " Miss Enid Lockhart turned out to be an extra fantastic cook , doing things the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird with meal made of this and that and mushrooms and snails , pouring rum , if you 'd like , right on the dressing , and roasted it over a spit . We had some eggs copped from a golden eagle 's nest and berries and cream and tea which was spiked with poteen that we had traded for with one of the passing tinkers . I mean they did n't even say a word about us drinking poteen . Miss Enid Lockhart was a very pretty lady in a manner of speaking , if you like fragile Protestant types . She seemed just as openmindedas Mr. Ingram , because it was she who suggested that poteen would go well if we had any . Otherwise we 'd have never taken the jug out in front of them . Anyhow , the way they were acting , it was n't hard to fancy they were in a marrying mood . I think Conor and I were most proud of the fact there was an unspoken bond between us all . Unmarried couples just did n't roam around the mountains together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would stir the sanctimonious ire of every preacher on Inishowen . The fact that they trusted us without even instructing us to that trust made us feel very close and I guess we both knew that Mr. Ingram had a special place in his heart for his two papists . He fired his pipe and gazed over the meadow , which was filling upp255with the low violet and purple colors of a softening sun , and we all groaned our contentment . " Who plays the flute ? " Miss Lockhart asked . " I do . I learned it from my daddy , Fergus , who is the poet of our village . " " Would you ? " It was ever so still with but a wee breeze stirring the heather and naught but the sound of my flute mixed with an occasional harmony from the animals and the dogs racing around wrestling and tumbling . I was sincerely impressed with the sounds I was making because they never sounded this grand before . When I was done Conor sang an old shepherd 's air as peaceful and lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , " she said , " both of you . " " I 've always theorized , " Mr. Ingram said , " that when we do get to heaven we 'll find it a rather decent place . Our earthly wants and woes will be lifted forever . However , one must consider that , with all the billions of souls there , the administration of the place must be staggering . " " Sure I never thought of that , " I said . " For example , transporting the souls in and out of purgatory . Someone must register them all and keep track of them just to seeif they are qualified to stay . I 'm certain that everyone will be assigned to a job of sorts , one he or she likes , but the organization of the place has to be tremendous . After one is there for six or seven centuriesall the contentment might get a little dull . " Obviously we had n't heard this assessment of heaven from Father Lynch and had supposed that everything would be done up there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running heaven was certainly a revelation . " To get to my point , " he said , " it seems that we have to have moments of turmoil to contrast to moments of peace in order to truly understand and appreciate that peace . ' What we have captured this moment in this meadow is an instant of peace . Right here and now , this is paradise , do you agree ? " " Aye , it 's paradise , " Conor said . " What we have confused is the belief that heaven and paradise are the same . So long as we are capable of moments of paradise here , we ought to cherish them , because we may not find paradise in heaven . "  | " Bravo , " Miss Lockhart said . " You 're right , " I said , " heaven ca n't be any better than this . " After that I played the flute again and we all sang some Scottish songs led by Mr. Ingram . Conor stopped at stream edge and flipped a rock into the still pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good roach fishing there , especiallynow that it 's clouding up . " Mr. Ingram rubbed his hands together , a man yet in paradise . " I 'll show you how to fish , lad , the way a Scotsman does it . " " Well , have your go , " Conor answered . " I 've seen strange luck that defies reason at times . " " You 'll mind your words later when you look into my creel . " " Well , try to get enough for one decent meal for the lot of us , " hesaid . " I 'll be getting on to my chores now . I 'll see you later , sir . " " Conor ! " he said sharply . " Aye ? " " Do n't you think we 'd better have a talk ? " Conor sighed and nodded . " I guess so . " He sidled down on the bank , letting his feet hang in the water . " My daddy told you where we were , did n't he ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing his fishing rod . " What did he say to you ? " " A lot of things . Essentially that you 're a farmer . " " I 've been so happy at the forge and with my books . Why must I be made to feel guilty over it ? And why in God 's name should I be threatened that I 'm going to lose both ? " " Do n't you know the answer , Conor ? " " What did you say to my father , Mr. Ingram ? " " I told him that because a man is a farmer is no reason to shut out the light and beauty one can find through books . A farmer has the same right to enrich his mind as anyone . " " Did you meet my brother Liam ? " " I made it a point . " " He 's a good lad , Liam . All he wants is the farm and to be a followerof my father . My daddy knows what Liam wants and he knows what I want . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does he know ? " " Maybe he pretends not to . Why , Mr. Ingram ? "  |p257The  teacher shook his head . " He considers books and ideas as a threat that will lure you away from Ballyutogue . He 's terrified of you wrapping yourself up in the cause for Irish freedom . To him it 's a path to misery and death , nor does he want the Larkin dynasty to end . They 've been strong men , one after the other , the kind of leaders Liam can never be . " " But ca n't I do that as a blacksmith ? " " No . He places infinite value on the land and , with the Irish peasant , it goes deeper than the breath of life . Conor , every parent I 've ever spoken to has told me he loves all his children exactly the same . Most parents actually believe that . It 's not true . Your father loves you more than the others . As you know , people leaving Ireland is the tragedy of Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he becomes desperate because passing the land is the only way he knows of closingthe circle of his life . " " Mr. Ingram , I love my daddy but . . . but ... " The teacher 's arm went about Conor 's shoulder knowingly . " In most places most parents come to realize that their children are going to find their own way . They may not like the idea but in time they make peace with it . " " But my daddy never will , is that what you 're saying ? " " He ca n't do it any more than he can give up breathing . " " What am I supposed to do ? " Conor asked shakily . " Well , you and I are both of Celtic stock . We know that our kind can go on for a hundred years without talking to one another . Eventuallyyou 're going to have to face him and make your decision clear . " " I ca n't , Mr. Ingram , I ca n't do that . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed insideyou for days and years . Sometime the breaking point must come and , when it does , it will be a day of terrible sorrow . " Conor . " " Aye ? " " You sleeping ? " " Not since you just woke me up to ask . " " I made up my mind what I 'm going to do with it . " " With what ? " " The notebook Mr. Ingram gave me . I 'm going to write my version of the history of Ireland . "  | " That 's grand . Go to sleep . " " What are you going to do with yours ? " " I 've not made up my mind . " " Ah , you 're lying to me , man . I saw you writing in it . ' What are you writing ? " Conor did n't answer so I asked him again . " Poems , " he said finally . " Can I read them ? " " Maybe later . And do n't you go poking around behind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt . Now go to sleep with you , will you ? " " Conor . " " Aye . " " She 's nice . " " Miss Enid Lockhart . " " Sure that 's true enough , " Conor agreed . " Did you ever consider what it would be like to be a priest ? " I asked . " Jaysus , Seamus , Jaysus . " " My ma is always making sly suggestions at me . I think that 's why she decided to let me go to the national school . After all , she says , what am I going to do with my life ? Colm is getting the farm . And here am I knowing how to read and write just like a priest . ' She says I would be the most important person in the village , nae , the entire parish , maybe the only person who can read and write . And , if I become a bishop it would be like having my own earldom . All I have to do is tell everybody what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the good of all the education ? " " My ma is going to make a priest out of Dary , " Conor said . " Oh , really . Wo n't your daddy be fierce ? " " He 's got nothing to say about that wane . " " How can you tell ? " " By the way she 's got Dary tied to her . He 's two years old and he 's already imitating her on her knees . He could pray before he could talk . " " I know what you mean , " I said . " I liked to got my head broken for just yelling at Dary once . " " Ma does n't let anyone look at him sideways . He even sleeps with them . " Conor propped on an elbow . " I 'd never make a priest . I 'm going to enjoy fucking too much . "  | " There must be something good about fucking if it 's so sinful , " I agreed . " I was kind of hoping maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrack . " " You 'd be foolhardy to do that , " Conor said . " How come ? " " She 's always confessing . " " Yeah , I guess you 're right . I 'll remember that , " I said , salvaging my manly intentions . " It 's probably not that great anyhow . I never heard of anybody who enjoyed it after they got married . Well , certainly not after the first baby . " " My ma and daddy always did , " Conor said . " You 're putting me on . " " Nae , it 's true . " " How did you know ? " " Well , even with the door shut in the loft , there 's cracks to look through . They always laughed a lot when they were doing it , and kissing and saying the dumbest kind of words . " " Surely ! " " Aye , they did . And they used to do it three and four times a week . " " Honest to God ! " " Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting in the mood . My daddy would hang around the fire slapping Ma 's behind and pinching her and she 'd giggle . Sure enough ... " " Wow ! " I said . " It 's certainly not like that at my house . I could hear Ma and Daddy from the byre and it was nothing like that , I can tell you . Daddy would make awful grunting noises , you know , like some of the farm animals , and Ma would complain about some aches and tell him to get it over with . I do n't recall them ever having fun at it . Conor , did Tomas and Finola enjoy it through all the babies and everything ? " " Well , they have n't since Dary was born . You remember when I had to fetch Dr. Cruikshank . " " Do I ever remember that , " I said . " All the women waiting around the cottage muttering that Finola was going to get away . I was so-scared . " " I think something happened to her insides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any more . But once , before Dary was born , they were sending the same kind of secret messages to each other like Mr. Ingram and Miss Lockhart. "  | " Do you think they 're doing it ! " I said , astonished . " Arc you daft ? Look at them . " That was too much for me to comprehend . . . fucking without sin . " Maybe Protestants are permitted to enjoy it for some reason we do n't know . " " Everyone is , " Conor said . The summer fled too fast and our hearts died as the days ' sunlight grew less and less . The time to go was on us . We had fattened the cattle and brought a dozen calves into the world without loss , and the sheep were bulging with wool like the great white clouds that passed above . Liam was sent up with the cart and horses to fetch us . We stored our arms , took up our nets from the stream , broke camp and killed the fire , coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notebook on Irish history and intended to give it to Mr. Ingram as a present . On our last night , Conor let me read one of his poems . THE MAGIC MEADOWI go high to a magic meadow When it 's light the full day round , And I set me down in a fairy rath , And wait for the banshee 's sound . The voice of Wolfe Tone from his cell I hear quite clearly now , Calling up all his sons and daughtersFrom the hearth and the byre and the plow . And I gaze o'er the magic meadow , Where the gorse is growing thick , And there 's nae a body there to see . Is it all a fairy trick ? I come down from the magic meadow When it 's brown and the harvest 's soon , But the voice of Tone wo n't leave me alone For a rising by the moon . Conor Larkin , 1887 , age 14p261When we crossed the River Crana we took a last look back to that place where the world beyond opened and beckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to us . It was also a place where time stood still in that moment we came to know as paradise . The seasons came and passed , one after another . Nothing much changed except the deepening weariness of our people trudging that endless treadmill of struggle and futility . The step became slower and the prayer more fervent for the final sleep to overtake them . There was an ever growing number of " American wakes , " as sons and daughters emigrated and relatives and neighbors gathered to mourn them as they mourned the dead , for once they left Ireland they left forever . The marriage of Mr. Ingram to Miss Enid Lockhart came as no surprise at all . Conor and I were invited to the wedding and receptionand did not attend for obvious reasons , but we did watch the ceremony from outside the church . A reception was held afterward at Hubble Manor where Mr. Ingram had become a great favorite of Lady Caroline . We watched everyone going in through the main gates . I must admit that Lady Caroline was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned from their honeynoon in Scotland , Conor and I went to see him . Conor made the most beautiful set of wrought-iron bookends you 'd ever hope to see , which he gave as a wedding present in both our names . I think Mr. Ingram was sincerely moved . He never asked us why we did n't come because he knew . There were a lot of things between us we never exactly put into words because they were understood . " I should like to give you something too , " he told us . " Miss Enid ... Mrs. Ingram has a surplus of family Bibles so I should like you to have mine . " Both Conor and I stared at it as he set it on his desk , for it was the most dangerous contraband imaginable for the likes of us . " The farmers of Scotland are a very poor and hard-working lot , " Mr. Ingram said . " Things were never as bad for them as they 've been for you , but it 's been no picnic , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , then walked to the window and put his hands behind him as I 'd seen him do sop262many times in class . " No one knew how to read very well except for the holy book . Every night before retiring was a time of special joy . We 'd gather around my father before the fire , four sons and four daughters , and he would read from the Bible . The tradition from his father was so deep that he and most of the others could recite it by heart . It is the wellspring of our language . " He turned from the window . " I 've come to learn that it 's not quite as rich a language as yours , but it 's not so poor either . . . see , I even speak a bit like you now . If I had my wish you 'd be able to learn the Bible in your own language . You see , lads , there is no more beautiful way that words have been used and thoughts expressed . " Conor nodded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened the cover . It was very , very old , with each new son who inheritedit placing down his name . From Adair Ingram it was over two hundred years to Andrew . " We 're very honored , " I said , " but I think we do n't deserve it . " " I want you and Conor to have it in particular because I believe you 've a gift from the fairies with your own words . Father Lynch notwithstanding , would you accept it in the spirit of learning ? " Conor and I like to died from the pain of it when Andrew Ingram and his darling wife left Ballyutogue . On the nomination of Lady Caroline he was appointed to run the largest school in Derry . From the time we returned from the booley house Conor and Tomas went into a silent spell . Conor was allowed to return to Mr. Lambe 's forge and he studied as hard as ever but it was a soiled game they played . Tomas continued to pretend that Conor would remain in Ballyutogue and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything to the contrary . Their silence was finally broken with the news that Daddo Friel had gotten away . Daddo was a long ways up the road but even so it came as a terrible sorrow . Along with Mr. Ingram , he had been the important teacher in our lives . We traveled up to his village of Crockadaw to what was to be the last great wake on Inishowen . Kevin O'Garvey came from Derry and delivered a eulogy that would have made the old Fenian stand up in his grave . The night was filled with many stories of Daddo and the circle of his closest friends were weeping out loud in their poteen . By the second dawn Kevin broke down and babbled his anguish over the political strife that had torn the fabric of the Irish Party.  |p263Charles  Stewart Parnell had been driven from the leadership and Kevin , being among his own , spilled his overfull heart on our ears . Parnell 's enemies had long been a pack of jackals eternally on the prowl for the great man 's throat . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilmainham Jail , years before when the Land League was declared illegal . The British ended up with their foot in their mouth over that one , redeclaring it legal . Later , Parnell was accused of taking part in the political assassinationof the British First Secretary in Dublin . Only in the courtroom under cross-examination did his accuser , Richard Piggot , break and admit the letter of accusation was a forgery . Piggot fled to Spain afterward and killed himself . No sooner had Parnell weathered one political storm than the British were after him again . He was finally destroyed by the dragging up of an ancient affair . Early in his career , Captain W. H. O'Shea was a trusted associate . O'Shea had long been estranged from his wife , Kitty . She became Parnell 's mistress and over the years bore him three children , one of whom died . It was not until after a decade of Parnell 's life with Kitty O'Shea that her husband saw fit to sue for divorce and name Parnell as corespondent in an act of cold-blooded vengeance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the gates of wrath had opened . At first the Irish Party and the people rallied to him but soon every Catholic pulpit in the land rained damnation on the adulterers with our own Father Lynch not being the least among them . As the bishops raged and the scandal deepened , Gladstone , that shining Liberal knight , demanded Pamell step down from leadership of the Irish Party as the price for introducing another Home Rule Bill . The Irish Party members of Parliament convened in a room in Westminster . In the battle that ensued , Kevin O'Garvey was with the twenty-six who remained loyal to Parnell . Among the leaders of the opposition who ousted him was the selfsame Michael Roche who had once exhorted us from Celtic Hall in Derry . Parnell returned to Ireland with Kevin O'Garvey and made a futile attempt to regain control . On the first night of Daddo Friel 's wake Kevin confided to us that Parnell was exhausted from fourteen years of unabated warfare . Kevin was deeply concerned over the man 's health . " He 's half crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to rest himself but he would n't listen . " Hearing such words was frightening . For Conor and me , Parnellp264was like a god . Tomas fed the fires of Kevin 's bitterness , saying over and over that freedom was a mirage and the only logical end was the hanging tree . I knew , of course , those words were for Conor 's consumption . Kevin was called away from the graveyard the instant Daddo was put into the earth . The caller was a messenger from the General Post Office carrying a telegram , which often as not was a harbinger of death . We went looking for Kevin frantically as soon as we could get away , and found him on the edge of the village , salted with tears , sobbing convulsively , unable to speak . Conor took the message from his hand and I saw the desire of life drain from him . " Parnell is dead . " We were to discover that he had gone to his deathbed during a short visit to England . Kitty was at his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are profaned in life but exalted in death . The outpouring of genuine and hypocritical grief had never been duplicated as he was laid to rest near Daniel O'Connell . It all took place in the year of eighteen and ninety-one . Parnell left us at the age of forty-five . The magnificent Irish Party he had forged , and which became a menace to the British , now fragmented and knuckled under to British demands . With Parnell gone , much of the Irish aspiration went with him . What seemed to go out of Conor and myself went out of the Irish people . The great thrust for freedom came to a sudden , confused halt . We were croppies again , standing out in the cold and freezing with our noses pressed hungrily against the window .. . waiting . . . waiting . . . waiting .. . " I came as quickly as I could , " Roger said . " How is he ? " " He has cancer , Roger , " Clara answered calmly , having called into play her full theatrical skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of intense pain . At any rate , you have to know it is fatal . " " Why did n't you let me know sooner , for God 's sake ? " " Arthur is good at pretending that what is real is n't real . It makes little difference now . " His father looked frightful . Roger feigned that it was reassuring top265see him more fit than he had anticipated . Lord Arthur was propped up with pillows , sucking at a cigarette and holding a snifter of cognacin his other hand . Roger protested the excesses but his father answeredit really did n't matter and he 'd just as soon slip under with a decent taste in his mouth . " Clara trimmed my hair up just for you . At least you have n't had to pay my barber bills on top of everything else . " " Father , I do n't find that very amusing . " " You 'll have to forgive my newly found sense of humor . It becomesdownright diabolical at times . " " Now you listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roger , this blasted thing is awful , really awful . Let 's both dispensewith any pretense that I 'll get out alive . Now tell me , how are Caroline and the boys ? " " Frightfully worried . She 's on her way back from England now . She 'll be down as soon as she can fetch the boys . Sir Frederick is sending his private car so we can take you back to the Manor . " " No , I sha n't go . Only this time I mean I sha n't . " " I have to insist , Father . " " If Caroline can have her sons on the kitchen table at Hubble Manor , I am entitled to die in Daars . Fear not , dear boy , you 'll have the corpse soon enough for pomp and solemn occasion . But , Roger , no Orange bands , no matter how important it is to family interests . I shall not be entombed in that family vault with the strains of The Old Orange Flute ' ringing in my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band from Belfast playing an old regimentalrequiem . Perhaps Caroline can whip together a chamber orchestra . She 's got such smashing taste , that girl , I 'm putting it in her hands .... " " Father , that 's quite enough ! " " I told you about my sense of humor . " Roger gritted teeth and twitched face muscles , seeing no object in argument and disliking the torrent of self-abuse from his father . " Roger , you and I have managed to tolerate each other all these years . That shows good breeding . " He gnashed his own teeth and moaned , waving the cigarette . " Put this bloody thing out . " " Is there anything that can be done about the pain ? " " No , I 'm quite doped up . Clara has even slipped me an opium pipe obtained from one of her old stage mates . Helps a bit . The rumor is that you and Caroline do a bit of that on the Continent.  |p266Smashing  woman , Caroline . The Chinese are terribly civilized . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got this thing and give them a pipe and let them just drift away . How 're the boys ? " Knocked out from the opening amenities , Lord Arthur drifted for a time . His eyes opened hard , as though jarringly frightened , from his trance . " One does a lot of moralizing , lying here day after day . Know what I 'd do if I were you ? " " What , Father ? " " Sell everything and get out of Ireland . God knows how many littleParnells have been spawned in the gutters of Dublin . The quaint folk are all rested from the famine by now and you can be sure their dirty little back rooms are seething with rebellion .... " After medication , Arthur wearied and spoke in semi-coherent patches as his son took up the death watch . He and Clara had tea without words , then she left to rest at his insistence . Arthur groaned to consciousness halfway through the night . " I 'm here , " Roger said . " Roger ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the boys ? " " They 're fine , Father . On the way to Daars . " " Good . You know , Roger , I 've been thinking a lot these days . The new century is bound to be ushered in with an insurrection by these people . You ought to get out of Ulster . " " It 's our home , " Roger whispered harshly . " Is it ? Has it ever really been ? " Roger walked to the foot of his father 's bed and spoke , as though to himself . " In every game one has to consider if the rewards are worth the risk . I suppose colonization is a high-risk game , like shark fishing out of Kinsale here . Frankly , we should be the last to complainover the rewards . " " Hear , hear , well said . Rampart of the Empire and all that . I feel though . . . the Crown is about to abandon me . . . they wo n't care to follow where I 'm going ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... and in the end . . . they may not choose to follow where Ulster leads them . . . . " Another scorching pain convulsed him . Roger took his father 's emaciated hand , startled by the sweeping wetness and cold . " I give you , " Arthur rasped , " the legacy of colonists . After threep267hundred years of attachment to the homeland with all the feelings of inferiority that are aroused by looking back over the shoulder .. . sometimes wistfully . . . sometimes defiantly . . . but always . . . alwaysas an outsider . We are as a stranger to those who sent us here . We are strangers to those whom we have usurped and exploited . And now . . . we are strangers to ourselves .... " Roger pulled the service cord trembling . The door opened fast , knowingly . The end came mercifully swift . After communicating arrangements for a proper funeral , Roger , Caroline and their sons set out to accompany the body back to Ulster . " I 'm frightfully sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say farewell to Father here . " " I quite understand . I was never comfortable at Hubble Manor . Daars was our home . At any rate , I 'll be moving out in a week or so . " " No hurry , of course . Can I help you with any plans , Clara ? " She shrugged . " Where are you going ? " " Wherever old whores go . " " Come now , none of that . There are a number of bequests in accordance with Father 's wishes . I think you 'll find everything .. . quite ... generous . " " In payment for services rendered , " she said acidly . " I know how much the two of you loved each other and I 've never for a single moment begrudged your relationship . Now , please . .. " The impact of coming loneliness hit her , the bitterness of total abandonment , of being placed forever on the outside . She reared up like a monumental bitch . " Some of our most amusing hours were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From time to time , since Caroline , you seem almost human , but of course we all know better . " Roger 's eyes turned dully expressionless . " He often used to speak of who was the worst of the Hubbies , you , he , or his father . He loathed himself but , as you know , he was too weak to do anything about it . His own father was suddenly faced with a crisis not of his creation , the famine . He reacted viciously for his survival . But you , Roger , you are coldly , carefully planning what it 's going to be like twenty years from now . You are the calculator , the creator of a new era of tragedy . Oh , Arthur envied your strength and your craft . He would say , The boy 's a marvel , see how he containsall that cruelty behind a facade of English pleasantness. ' "  | " Yes , " Roger answered blandly , " one can see how amusing you were with Father . " " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I can think of no greater curse . Now get out and leave us to what time we have left . " Roger walked to the door and opened it . " Roger ! Oh , God . . . I 'm sorry ... " " Well , one can not deny an old whore her curtain speech . That would be poor form indeed , " he said , and left . The mourning Hubbies , armbanded in black , returned Lord Arthur 's remains to the land of their ancestors . The principal public ceremony was held at Londonderry 's Guild Hall , a quasi-Gothic symbol of the Crown 's everlasting power and presence . It was London , clear to the four-faced clock , an imitation of Big Ben in her namesakemother city . The Queen sent high envoy to pay homage to one of her great earls of Ireland . In a quiet but noted ceremony some time after the funeral , Roger Hubble was declared the Eleventh Earl of Foyle and his eldest son Jeremy was named the new Viscount Coleraine . Two years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords , there was another death of note . Lord Randolph Churchill , the would-be creator of a new kind of imperial conservatism , met his end . Having been the master orator who played the Orange card and masterminded the fall of a Gladstone government , he had been rewardedat first with high offices but his early instability degenerated into debility and then madness . He died , insane , at the age of fortysixof syphilis. 1895As I went into my twenty-first year the Larkins had settled into that all too familiar family pattern in which affection between parentswas replaced by indifference . A devouring sense of possession by Finola for Dary stretched normalcy and reason . Finola had joined thep269majority of Ballyutogue mothers who had long lost any physical and esoteric sensations of love-making . Her home became like all the others in that her husband was a boarder and the sons treated as gentry . Dary seemed more and more certain to fulfill Conor 's prediction of priesthood . A woman living beyond the memory of carnal pleasure fails to understand why anyone else would crave or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push a son into a life of celibacy , which was in the purest Irish tradition . Dary was his mother 's preciouschild , smothered and fitted with blinders that would allow him to see only in the direction of the seminary . By eighteen and ninetyfiveat the age of ten , he was indulging in a full range of priestly behaviors . Finola did everything to encourage him short of addressing him as " Father . " Tomas lost the will to combat his wife 's obsession and gave her a wide berth . He often burst into uncharacteristic flashes of hostility against Dary but remained too proud to apologize after . Conor alone preserved a precarious balance within the family . He stepped into the vacuum left by Tomas to become a surrogate father to Dary . Ignoring Finola 's entreaties , Conor took his brother hunting and fishing , and shared the long walks and philosophies that went with them . Often as not , fair day would be spent in great part with Dary riding on his big brother 's shoulders . At the same time Conor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under . Without him the Larkins would have fallen to the Irish curse of family warfare . Dary remained fragile but despite his mother 's pampering grew to be a lovable boy . He was a gentle one with sharp wit and a grand knack of persuasion that made him a leader over the bigger and stronger kids . He was the shanachie , the maker of tales , and everyone in the village shared Finola 's delight that he was a special child . Because of his size Dary came to certain understandings about himself . From the time he knew he would become a priest , he felt the first principle of being a good one was the ability to bear pain and mortification as Christ had borne it . He was able to defeat larger enemies with the weapon of compassion . His ability to endure more punishment than anyone could invoke and to never show tears downrightfrightened would-be tormentors . Dary was truly the son of Tomas Larkin in more ways than Tomas realized.  |p270Conor  and I drifted into the " brotherhood " of drinking bachelors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and single , who drank with us had largely given up on life . Those of our own age were mostly marking time . A few would come into their parents ' land . Others would emigrate or leave for the city . . . or give up on life also . Lads with no possibility of inheriting land had no desire to get involved with the girls nor were they particularlyattractive as prospective husbands . The burden of marriage was looked upon as a fateful finality . Courting and chasing with no intention of marriage was a sin , so we courted little . Most of the girls would accept a serious advance only with the idea of marriage . With the normal pursuit of girls whacked out of our life by the Church and economics of the land , we found our respite in the " brotherhood " of drinkers . Liam was a good plain lad who seemed to accept his landless status without rancor . He had neither the charm , wit nor strength of ( his older brother and father , and little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Liam to make a decision as he neared his twentieth year , to leave or to remain and wither . Liam , with his limited capacities , became more and more torn . The lands unknown out there were frightening but the living example of those who stayed behind was equally terrifying . The weak of Ballyutogue who lacked the courage to emigrate stood every chance of remaining lifelong celibates . At best they might stumble into a late-in-life marriage . We had a full complement of the old toothless uncles and old maid aunts who never loved ormarried but stayed on to live in the byre or.hayloft on a dole of afew pennies for helping around the farm . As our villages filled up with this kind , and the strong departed , our strain became weaker . Despitethe plight of too many people and too many landless people , Father Lynch insisted on babies and insisted that we remain in the poverty of Ireland rather than emigrate where we would " live among heathen niggers and Chinamen . " Liam Larkin edged to his moment of truth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorriest lot of us all , for their choices were almost nil and their fate sealed . They vied hard to get husbands even though marriage meant a life sentence of servitude and perpetualpregnancy , for what else was there ? They could become the old maid aunt , a dried-up potato , or they could join the convent and become a nun . Emigration was far more difficult for a girl . Thep271chance of a full , rich life did n't seem to exist . With the hammer of chastity pounding on them from birth , fear of committing the most mortal sin circled them like a vulture on death watch . Brigid and her girl friends were denied the release of drinking , sports and roaming that the lads were allowed . How long the days would be for them between laughter , how long the nights without pleasure . Brigid Larkin was no beauty but the daughter of the likes of Finola and Tomas could not be without certain qualities of handsomeness . She seemed content to take the course of finding herself a lad who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a decent dowry , so her chances in the husband-seeking competition were quite good . Conor ! There was a lad ! He was n't behind the door when they passed out good looks . He grew strapping and tall like his daddy and , although he could outdrink and outfight anyone around , his true strength was in his softness . You could hear the angels weep when that boy sang , and there was music in his poems , which were seen only by Dary and myself , for he was not a man to boast . Mr. Lambe 's blacksmith shop had a constant stream of lassies seeking repairs on things which were n't broken . Even the Protestant girls were after him . Conor never got to nesting with a single bird , for his eye was always out on the horizon . He became a master ironworker , the peer of Mr. Lambe , and with the old blacksmith slowing up considerably , he took on much of the responsibility of the forge . Josiah Lambe had had the disaster befall him of fathering four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strong that Conor would be coming into the shop . The two of them had the specialbond of men who worked side by side creating out of iron . We 'd meet by night in the shebeen or the public house with the bachelor brotherhood and gamble on cards or dog races in town or anything there was to gamble on . Coming from Armagh , the Larkins had brought the game of road bowling with them , and after Tomas retired from the sport , Conor became the undisputed champion of slinging the two-pound iron ball on the course that ran the road from the Upper Village to the Township . We 'd gamble on that , too , burning hungry invaders after Conor 's crown . Conor Larkin was our leader . Everyone accepted that he would take over when Tomas left but he never committed himself to it . He was more like himself on those pensive mountain walks with Dary and me , by the stream , reading a new poem . It was eight years since our summer in the booley house but our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tomas went on and on . Tomas slowed some but remained the dominant figure among us as Kilty had before him . He quit his heavy drinking after a time and settled to being the boarder of Finola , who now hung onto her sons fiercely , daring the lassies to come near those proudest possessions of the Irish mother . It was just after the corn harvest that the terrible letter came from the president of the Baltimore Fire Fighters Benevolent Association telling us that Ed had been killed in the line of duty . Throughout the years we had grown to a dear relationship and I 'll never get over the fact I did n't get to meet him again . Ed carried an insurance policy of fifteen hundred American dollars which was left to me on the conditionthat I use it for an education . His death became my liberation . My inheritance was the event of the year in Ballyutogue . Can you imagine the advice I was getting ? In came Father Lynch with the face of a Lurgan spade and the heart of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , he insisted that a liberal gift to the Church ( meaning himself ) would win points with the Almighty . The pressure became fearsome , with my ma encouraging Father Lynch 's intervention to push me into the seminary . The money was more than enough to see me through college , which I craved and thought I 'd never live to see . Conor demanded I stick to my guns and , thanks to God , enough of the Larkin steel had rubbed off on me over the years to enable me to make my stand . Things were still in a state of monumental discussion the day Kevin O'Garvey sent word that the money and papers had been received . Enough heat was on to melt the skin off my back , but I made the first defiance of my parents since the riot at Bogside , coming to my entire height of five feet and four inches and announcing , " I am going to Derry to consult with Mr. Ingram . " It sounded more like a wake with the weeping and wailing that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education but become a priest ! " my ma pleaded . " I intend to become a teacher and perhaps a writer as well . " There ! I said it ! " But what of Father Lynch ! " " Father Lynch closes minds , I intend to open them . " Oh , my ma clamped her hands over her ears to hear no more ofp273that and my daddy merely scratched his head till I thought he 'd wear out his scalp . Even as I left for Derry they were both in St. Columba 's praying for my immortal soul . Mr. Ingram was headmaster of the largest school in all of Derry , and he and Miss Enid had two children of their own . I was never so proud as on entering his office and seeing the bookends we had given him right there on the shelf behind his desk . The choice of schools was extremely limited . Trinity College in Dublin was an unobtainable dream . It had been an ascendancy institutionfor centuries and , even if a Catholic could get in , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised me of a new Catholic college in Dublin run by Jesuits , but the curriculumwas extremely limited for non-religious studies . " It seems to narrow down to Queen 's College in Belfast . " God , that sounded frightening . He put me through a series of tests that lasted almost a full day and after he evaluated them I went to his home . I could see by the worried expression both he and Miss Enid wore that the results were not good . " You 've kept up on your English and literature well enough but you 're going to need quite a bit of private tutoring to make the entrance examinations . Knowing your capacity for work , I 'd say you 'll be ready after four or five months of penal labor . " Tutoring ! My dreams went flying and the gravy ran out of me . " How much will all that tutoring cost ? " I peeped . " Do you still play the flute ? " Miss Enid asked . " Aye . " " How about two tunes a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I answered . " I 've had a hunger to teach since I 've been stabled with the two children , " she said . " We 've a splendid attic room , grand for studying by day and daydreaming by night . We 'll get you all plumped up and ready for Queen 's , so go home and pack your things and let 's get to work . " I bit my tongue and did everything I possibly could but I cried nevertheless and when I could talk again I said that I 'd make them proud . " You 've done that many times already , " Mr. Ingram answered . The drinking brotherhood , virgins one and all except for Conor , who had done some fucking with Protestant girls , gathered for ap274last blow at Dooley McCluskey 's . They told me not to break too many hearts in Derry and surely I would knock them dead when I got to Belfast . Me . . . Seamus O'Neill , the first college student in Ballyutogue 's history . Make a million and buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conor were done in with joy . . . he was hurting. ... my back was sore from all the slappings and my ears rang with huzzahs to beat the world . McCluskey sprang for a round of drinks , a rarity between wakes , then pointed to the clock . The stage to Derry would be due in the diamond soon .. . ... outside the pub and under the hanging tree we all fell all over each other one more time .. . ... then McCluskey himself held everyone back so 's Conor and I could make the walk to the Township alone .. . ... and we did with no words between us and we waited in the diamond .. . ... and pretty soon , the stage came .. . " Good-by , runt , " he said , putting an affectionate headlock on me , then slapped my bottom and pointed to the coach .. . ... am I ever to forget Conor Larkin standing there alone in the diamond as we clip-clopped away . . . just standing there . . . his hands shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaunty crooked way . . . looking out to that horizon where I was heading . Liam entered the forge near quitting time . Conor waved to him , pulled a glowing metal from the fire , laid it over a hardie on the anvil and in a few moments had it beaten into the scooped-type lazy bed digger preferred by most of the farmers of Ballyutogue . He ordered the apprentice boy to bank the fire and clean up the shop , untied his heavy leather apron and slapped Liam on the back . Outside at the well , Conor dunked his face and assembled himself . Liam handed him a letter and watched his brother 's face break into a grin as he ripped the envelope open . " Aye , there 's a lad , " he said . " Seamus has passed all his tests for Queen 's and has moved to Belfast to his Uncle Conan . I 'll stop on the way home and read this to Fergus and Mairead . " He folded itp275and shoved it into his pocket for rereading later . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held him in place . " I was in Derry yesterday , " Liam said with nervous speed . " I got the word from Kevin O'Garvey to come in and see him . " " About what ? " Liam plopped on the big rock by the wheelwright 's hub band . He hung his head and nibbled at his lip . " About what ? " Conor repeated , sensing trouble . " Do you remember when I went to Derry for the special wool marketingauction last year ? " " Aye . " " I went to see Kevin at the same time . " " About what ? " Conor asked apprehensively . " Suitable emigration . He 's been looking into the matter for me . " Conor reacted like a snared rabbit with a jolt of fear shivering him and shutting his voice down . His eyes widened as Liam scooped up a handful of pebbles and pitched them out to the road one at a time . " I 'll be leaving in a matter of days , " he said . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't exactly no secret . Everyone knows I was up to emigrate . One minute I wanted it and one minute I did n't . I just did n't know how to make up my head on the matter , Conor . You know , I was just confused . " Even as Conor agonized he patted his brother 's shoulder in understanding . The weight of it was like an anvil on his back and his mind continued muddled . " Where are you going , Liam ? " he managed . " New Zealand , " Liam answered . " New Zealand ! You ca n't go there , man . It 's too bloody far ! " " What difference does it make how far ? " " Oh no , you 're daft , man , " Conor said , seizing at the straw . " We 've not the money to send you there , it 's no good , no good at all . " He paced and beat his hand into his fist , trying to find one more straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over . " Liam shook his head , puzzled . " I ca n't . I 've signed onto a scheme to work off my passage . They 've large ranches in the southern half of the country and they need sheepmen , farmers and drovers . It will take two years to pay the fare but then I 'll be in the clear . I hear tell there 's land to be had , so in another two or three years after I work my passage , I might be able to buy some of my own . " " See there , " Conor cried , " it 's a bloody trick , like the famine ships . I 'll not let you get into a scheme like that . Once they get youp276there you 'll be working your passage for life . . . that 's it . . . you ca n't go , Liam . " Still confused over his brother 's seizure , he gestured to cut it off . " It 's a legitimate plan . Kevin himself assures me of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it big and we 're being supervised by the Church . Kevin has already sent three lads out of Derry and they 're all starting to do well . " Conor knelt on a knee , deflated , and his eyes darted a bit wild . He knew he 'd better calm down . There was only one way to go at it and none other . " New Zealand , " he whispered . " So much the better for my chances , " Liam said . " New Zealand , " Conor repeated as though they were the heaviest words in the language . He looked up to Liam with deliberateness . " I 'm putting something to you straight . I do n't want you to go . I'vemy own trade and I 'm earning almost as much as a carriage maker . Would you stay here if Daddy agrees to pass the farm to you ? " Liam shook his head . " Now it 's you talking daft . You 've got to know I 've never felt ill of you because the land is rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He wo n't , I know he wo n't . " " If he does , " Conor insisted , " would you stay ? " " Aye , " Liam answered as if in a sweet dream , " that 's all I 've ever wanted . Oh , holy Mother , I know every dear inch of every plot and every stone in every wall . Conor , I chill all over with fright when I think of going so far away . We never got to talking about it because I did n't want to get my hopes up , but there 's a couple of lassies looking right good to me and I would be after courting one of them if only . . . oh , Conor , what the hell are we talking about ? Tomas will never agree . Listen , you 've got to know I hold no ill feeling to you . " Conor grabbed his brother 's arms fiercely . " We 're talking to Daddy , Liam , and we 're going to make him see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking . I could never face Daddy with it . " " I 'll do it , I 'll do it . " There was a positive time Tomas entered his cottage and that wasafter the rosary was said and before supper was served . When Brigid , Dary and Finola got off their knees , the men came in . Supper was held in its usual silence . " Are you going to make lace tonight , Brigid ? " Conor asked as she cleared the table . " I 've no plans to . "  | " Go visit a girl friend . . . and take Dary with you . " " Oh , listen to himself , " Brigid snipped back . Brigid half jumped out of her skin as Conor 's fist all but split the table . She 'd never seen him act that way . As all their eyes interplayed , the sense of pending battle was obvious . " You 'd best do what your brother says , " Tomas said softly . " Come along , Dary , " Brigid said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haymaker . " She banged the door after herself deliberately . The three men sat in stone silence and Finola whined under her breath as she shuffled around the fire . " Liam 's leaving for New Zealand next week , " Conor snapped . " Oh , Mary save us ! " Finola cried . " Quiet , Ma , " Conor commanded . He leaned over the table so that he was nose to nose with his father . " Daddy , I 'm telling you to ask Liam to stay . " Tomas slurped at his tea . " I 'm an ironmaster and I 'll not take the farm , " Conor continued . " Now you tell Liam you want him to have it ! " Tomas drank again with deliberateness , set the cup down slowly , his eyes moving from one son to the other . " You 'll not be making decisions that are mine to make , " he said . " And you 'll not be making decisions that are mine to make ! " Conor shouted . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of our life none of us will really get used to no matter how many times it happens . How many nights I 've lay awake crying to be able to keep the both of you . It 's not the way in Ireland and it will never be so long as we 're tenants in our own country . " " Tomas , be reasonable , " Finola implored . " It 's in your power to be reasonable . If you want both of your sons here you can keep them . Be reasonable , Tomas ... " " Reasonable ! Who 's unreasonable around here ? The way you suffocate the air and hide the light from Dary . " " Dary 's nothing to do with this ! " Conor cried . Tomas was up and shaking a fist at his wife . " He 's fragile because you want him that way . Shut up , woman , or get out ! This is between me and my sons ! " She shrank into a corner sobbing . Tomas heaved a sigh and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it 's got to be , lad . I 'll grieve for you . "  |p278Liam  screamed and pounded on the table . " For me you 'll grieve ! That 's a lie , Daddy ! You love Conor ! That 's why I 'm going to the farthest place on earth . . . because you love Conor ! Liar ! Liar ! " He tore up the ladder and flung himself into the loft and Conor started up after him . " Leave him be ! " Tomas ordered . Conor halted , then inched down the ladder and came to his father . His eyes looked up as the sound of his brother 's anguished sobs reached them . In the loft great gobs of salt tears ran into Liam 's mouth and down his chin . Conor rose before his father . " I 'll not have your fucking land ! " he screamed . Tomas reached for him but he jerked away . " I did it for you , Conor , " Tomas begged . " You 'll stay , lad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the devil you do n't . " " And what about the devil Liam does n't know ! " " It 's his burden . He knows it . Ah , Conor , boy , you 're the Larkin . You 're the Larkin who 's tall in every man 's eyes . " " No , Daddy ! " Conor rasped . " You 've created a Conor who has never lived . I do n't want to be that Conor ! I 'm me , goddammit , I 'm me ! I 'm not Kilty or Tomas . . . I 'm me and I 've got to live ! " " Oh , listen , boy , I 've done everything for the love of you . " Liam 's sobs fell soft and weak now as his fingers clutched and released the hay . The two giants who cast their shadow over his life now spewed venom on each other . On the same night , Conor Larkin left the cottage , never looking back over the crossroad . He stopped for a moment before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured mind . " Conor ! " wee Dary 's voice called through the darkness . " Conor ! " He turned away quickly and continued down the road . " Conor ! " the voice pleaded again and again . He stopped and listened as the tiny feet ran hard at him and the boy 's arms wrapped desperately around his knees . Conor lifted him as he had done a thousand times over and he buried him in his mighty arms , then set him down gently and shook his head to say he was unable to speak and Dary nodded that he understood and Conor went on his way . Dary entered the cottage . The look of him told Tomas and Finola everything . " You 'd better ask Liam not to leave , " Finola said.  |p279Tomas  shook his head . " That would be so unfair to Liam , " he said . " Liam knows he has to go . He 's always known that . I ca n't ask him to stay because . . . when Conor comes back . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ... "  | " Who 's out there ? " Kevin O'Garvey called from the second-story window . " Conor , Conor Larkin . " In a moment Kevin opened the door of his fine new house on Creggan Road in Derry and held the lantern close . " Is that yourself ? It 's three in the morning , Conor Larkin , and you look the wrath of God . " A bleary-eyed , bearded wreckage followed Kevin into the parlor where he slumped , hung his head , drooped his arms between his legs and stared misty to the rug . Teresa O'Garvey followed her husband in a moment , buttoning up her dressing gown . She took one look at Conor and said , " Bring him to the kitchen . " The big stew pot was always at a simmer in the O'Garvey kitchen , for there was no telling who would come and when . She dished up a bowl and sliced him a half loaf of bread . " Throw that across your chest , " she said . The heat of it burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trembling with hunger , and mumbled he 'd not eaten in three , maybe four or five days . He 'd been wandering aimlessly , sleeping in the fields . Three bowls later , the food took hold . Conor 's story came out in bits and pieces at the kitchen table . Kevin eyed his wife in such a way as to tell her to leave them alone . " Merciful God , " she said as she left the kitchen . Kevin paddled around getting tea together . " It had to happen , " he said . " You 've been brutalizing each other for years . " " I kept telling myself that Daddy would have to see it clearly sooner or later . I kept telling myself he 'd change his mind and sit us down and talk it over and ask Liam to stay . As I was walking through the country , I tried to go back a thousand times and plead with him , but it would be no damned use . I 've gotten better responsesoff a wall . Kevin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick glasses and rubbed his eyes , then sugared his tea . " You 've got to do it before Liam 's ship leaves , would you ? " Conor repeated . " I do n't know , " Kevin answered wisely . " Did you ever think things might be better for you away from Ballyutogue ? " Conor nodded , half ashamed that those were his thoughts indeed . " It might solve things for Liam if he returned but it will never solve them for the Conor Larkin I know . It was never a matter of you leaving there , but only when . " " That 's the worst of it , " Conor said , " I know you 're right . I know I ca n't go back . " " No , you ca n't . Liam 's emigrating in a few days . Will you be fol-lowing ? " " I 'll not be driven out of Ireland , " Conor answered . " Look , you 're done in , lad . Let 's not think about it tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aye . " " I do n't want you to rush . I 'll be going to London for a session of Commons . Stay on and get your head cleared at least till I get back . Will you promise that ? " Conor said he would and , as he did , exhaustion flooded him so that his walk to the stable was uneven . He took the lantern and started up the ladder and whispered , " Thanks . " " For nothing , " Kevin answered . " I 've hurt my daddy . I 've hurt him bad . " From their bedroom window Teresa stood watching until the light from the stable quenched . " Poor lad , " she said . Kevin paced at the foot of the bed . " I ought to be used to watching them go by now . What an abortion of a people we are , sending away boys and girls like him by the thousands every year , leaving behind the weak , giving away our wealth . How many more can we afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teresa said . " The Larkins have always been too close to your heart . " " Aye , but it 's what it 's all about , Teresa . Parnell . . . " He quit as he choked on memory of the name . " Parnell and I would talk about it for hours . It all comes home to roost when you think of losing one like Conor . " " Perhaps we can keep him here somehow . "  | " We 've got to . There 's only so much we can keep giving up . Conor may make it . He 'll not go down easy . " " Come to bed now . " He tucked the blanket about him but continued to stare up to the ceiling . Teresa reached over and took the glasses from his face and set them on the marble-topped stand . " I wish Parnell were alive . There was always hope then . ... " Liam left the Harbour Board Office . Conor waited at the corner . He picked up Liam 's battered wicker suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in order ? " " Aye . " " Let 's have a look . " Conor opened the large envelope with documentscovered with stamps , seals and ribbons . " Would you ever ! " Conor said . " Rabat , Tunis , Alexandria , Suez Canal , Aden , Bombay , Ceylon , Jakarta , Perth , Melbourne and Wellington . " " Never heard of most of them , " Liam said . " You have , have n't you , Conor ? " " In a manner of speaking . Seamus and I used to discuss them and we read a few books on the subject . Oh , they 're exotic places and thinking you get to walk around in them and feel them and smell them and all . Man , you 're in for a fantastic adventure . " " What do you know about New Zealand ? " Liam asked with quivering voice . " We never got much farther than Australia . However , I went to the library here . Actually , there was n't too much on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell . And the journey ! You 're a lucky one , Liam . " They turned the corner to Prince 's Quay , then stopped in their tracks at sight of a rusty old tramp steamer , S.S. Nova Scotia . Liam got sick to his stomach , clutched it , went into a sweat , closed his eyes and turned and faced the wall . His brother patted him but he was unfeeling of it . Conor looked desperately for hope beyond hope that Tomas would suddenly appeardown the quay and call for them . Oh , God , Daddy ! Please ! " I 'm so scared , " Liam croaked . " Only because it 's new and unfamiliar . Ten minutes after you 're under way , you 'll be yourself again , and after two months aboard ship you 'll be so ready to conquer New Zealand , there 'll be no hold/ing you back . " He turned and spun into Conor 's arms for the first time ever , shaking from head to toe as he did and sobbing incoherently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not the first lad out of Ireland to walk up that plank . " He shook him , hard , then gentle , hard , then gentle . Liam turned loose and stared at the ship , wavering . He licked his lips , drew in a wobbly breath and began his walk into exile . . . over the quay as though floating . He showed his papers and was waved through . Teresa and Kevin were there as they had been there for many years at the dockside of weary ships . She packed a basket as she had packed it for many years with salted and dried foods to augment the ship 's food on the journey . Their parting words were as uncomfortable as they had always been . " I 'm not mad at Daddy and I 'm not mad at you , " Liam said . " God look after you , Liam , " Conor said . " And the same God look after you . I think I 've come to know you may need him more than me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the search for a job . " Your name ? " " Conor Larkin . " " I 'll put you on the waiting list . " He went to the shipyard , the graving dock and the carriage makers , then walked the quays from Buncrana Road to the LetterkennyRoad , the rail yard in Waterside over the bridge and stopped at every stable and shop with a forge . " Your name ? " " Larkin . " " Sorry , the job has been filled . " " Look , I can see with my own two eyes your shop is short a man . " " Sorry , the job 's filled . " Belief that his skill as a master would make itself apparent any place he found a job , Conor offered to start as an apprentice boy . He was advised that apprenticeships had to be purchased , the cost was high and , at any rate , none were available . Within a fortnight the Derry system revealed itself ugly . Caw &; Train Graving Dock was the major employer of blacksmiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most private jobs without competition . This was thep289established order of things . Smaller forges were handed out subcontractsso long as they did what they were told . All of the shops from Caw &; Train down to its smallest satellite were Protestant owned and manned . The only Catholic blacksmiths were tiny affairs in Catholic neighborhoods verging on subsistence level and never receivingCaw &; Train subcontracts . The single major Catholic employer , a brewery , with its farrier and teamster work , kept the Catholicshops from sinking . If a man 's name was Catholic it automatically eliminated him from upper trade work . If the name was n't obviously Catholic , a quick reference check of his church , school or Orange affiliation establishedhis religion . Continuation of the Derry system was assured through the sale of apprenticeships which few Catholic families could afford and , if they could , the apprenticeship became unavailable . After exhausting every possibility in his own trade , Conor searched for other work . Derry had a large complex of mills and shirt factories but nearly all of that was female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system became unmistakably clear . The only work for Catholics was menial labor . Building trades had long waiting lists . Even those Catholic men with jobs had to have their entire families , wives and children , in the mills and factories to make existence . What was left was janitoring , dustmen for garbage collection , sewer workers , servants , male nurses in workhouses and the insane asylum . Forty per cent of the Catholic men were unemployed . Fifty men pounced on every job opening . Odd jobs of a few days at the cattle pens on the dock and as navvies on the railroads did come open but Conor refused to compete against men who had families to feed . This was the Derry system of Roger Hubble 's conception . Cheap female and child labor and a vast pool of unemployed so their product could compete with and undersell England . As long as Ulster remained in the Crown 's realm and received beneficial trade concessions , it spelled a windfall for her industry . Even though the labor pool was depleted by emigration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Derry retained the highest birth rate in the British Isles and Europe . The stench of the Derry system quickly led to human stagnation in the Bogside , a succumbing to lethargy or the pain of emigration . With each new day ending like the last , Conor walked back to hisp290room over the stable more and more slowly . He sought the solace of the library but was unable to concentrate and his frequent appearancesthere were met with hostile vibrations . The library was no place to harbor the idle and he was made to feel unwelcome . A storm at sea damaged two ships which limped into port in need of urgent repairs . For a fortnight Conor was able to work at Caw &; Train for sixteen hours a shift and displayed a skill equal to all and superior to most of the regular smiths . There were rumblings about the papist in an all-Protestant stronghold but the size of him discouragedpersonal harassment and , besides , they reckoned , the job was temporary . Inside the yard , Conor saw the final vileness of the Derry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmiths were in demand , but work was kept solely for loyalists in payment for their loyalty and his employment came to an abrupt halt when half a dozen blacksmiths arrived on loan from the Weed Works in Belfast . Conor 's revulsion brought him close to the breaking point only two months after his arrival . A mixed reaction of relief and apprehensiongreeted Josiah Lambe on his sudden appearance in Derry . Josiah Lambe was a simplistic man who had worked with and for Catholics . As a youth he divorced the populist notion that Ulster need be a battleground for the Reformation . Although his Presbyteriandevoutness was reasonable , his true religion was blacksmithing . He never wore an Orange sash . By the time he was ready to wind down his labors it was rumored that Conor Larkin would come into the forge . This was bearable to the Protestants of Ballyutogue , for the Larkins , even as adversaries , had a certain eminence . There would be no objection from the singlelassies about Conor 's presence . Josiah had meditated hard on the problem of Conor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient income from the shop to see out his remaining years , yet with Conor out of the picture he could not bring himself to sell to a stranger . Josiah traveled to Derry , found Conor , and got directly to the point , offering him the shop . He allowed as Conor could work off payment in a reasonable time and still earn a grand living . The deal was uncomplicated , for the old blacksmith was an uncomplicated man . After the shattering experience of Derry , visions of the peaceful littleforge below the crossroad among lifelong friends had crept heavilyinto Conor 's thoughts . Yet even as he aired his confusion , he was held by an invisible grip that would not allow him to return.  | " Why do n't you seek some outside advice from someone you trust ? " old Lambe suggested . " Kevin is still in London . He wakes up every morning and goes to sleep every night with other people 's problems . He does n't need mine as well . " " I 'm not suggesting O'Garvey , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined and even more so in your case . " " You 're not telling me to go see a priest , are you ? " " Oh , nae , lad . A priest would be even worse . Conor , you 've a bonny old friend in Derry who 's a little hurt you 've not seen fit to call on him . " Conor looked away guiltily . " Well , are you afraid to speak to Andrew Ingram ? " " I 've been tempted so many times . Back home the Larkins meant something , but here I 'm just another jobless , faceless Bogside downer . " " You 'd never be that in Andrew Ingram 's eyes any more than you would be to me . Do n't you think he does n't know why you have n't called on him ? Are n't you a bit ashamed ? " " Aye , I am . " " He said to me , Conor has to place more value on our friendship . ' " " You 're right , Josiah , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enid Ingram hustled her children from Andrew 's study , closing the door behind her . " They 're great wanes , " Conor said . " Seamus has written me about them many times . " " Just as Seamus has told them about you . You are a minor deity around here , you know . " " The lad is doing fine at Queen 's , " Conor said . Mr. Ingram smiled and passed it off . " I think we all knew Seamus would cut a tidy niche for himself . " Conor 's eyes became filled with pleading . " And me ? " Andrew Ingram stuffed his pipe with that certain deliberateness , showing a touch of sorrow as he did , and it seemed to outline telltale graying about his temples and the first deep lines of aging . He studied the brawny young man opposite him strangely , knowing so much about him . " Certain of us are meant for certain things , " he began . " I thank God I discovered at an early age and was able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a book kept on all of us from the moment we 're born . If only we could open it and really learn what 's in store . The problem is it takes most of us most of our lives to understand what we should have known from the beginning . " " What 's in store for me ? " Conor asked . " Well , you 're not going back , Conor , " he said with finality . " I guess I know that now . But I 'll not be driven out of this country , either . " " I 'm painfully aware . " " Painfully , Mr. Ingram . . . just because I ca n't stomach the injus-tice ? " " Painfully , because you 're going to spend your life trying to do something about it . There 's nothing wrong with fighting injustice . It 's only that , well , I 'm trying to tell you what your father had tried to tell you . " " What ... " " So long as the voices ring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and waved his hands to say that was nonsense . " I do n't know what book you thought you read on me , but . you 're mistaken . " " Am I ? " " But how can you know ? " " Conor , there 's a certain moment in each man when he becomes completely alive . Alive like at no other time , when he lights the very sky with his vivacity . Of course some people lack that capacity and others do n't seem to have it outside of the sex act . This fragment , this instant of electricity that strikes , is really you , your soul , your being . I sometimes feel it in me when I hear a magnificent actor reading Shakespeare . I become transformed , unique , complete . We 're friends , Conor , I know I 've seen that moment in you many times . " Conor paled . " Are you passing a sentence on me , Mr. Ingram ? " " No , but if you realize and accept , it may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book , Mr. Ingram . . . tell me ! " " I read that Conor Larkin of Ballyutogue joined a small band of brothers because he had no real choice in the matter . They called any cot in any hidden peeling room their home . In the beginning he was fired up with slogans and an awesome sense of righteousness . Then , when blow after blow and disenchantment upon disen/chantment rained down , the slogans became shadows without substanceand , in the end , very little changed for all his efforts . " " Aw , you 're daft , man , no such thing 's been written for me ! " Andrew Ingram made no effort to reply for a time . His pipe soured and he set it down and his eyes moistened . " The day that Seamus left for Queen 's , Enid and I talked the night through wondering whatever was to become of our two papist rebels . I marked a volume here that night and I said , Perhaps Conor will visit one day and ask me why things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see it , Conor ? " " The book of truth ? " he whispered . Ingram went to the shelves and withdrew one . A marker was in it . He opened the page and spoke now , with a voice rich from reading . " Innumerable force of Spirits armed , That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring , His utmost power with adverse power opposed In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven , And shook his throne . What though the field be lost ? And is not lost : the unconquerable will , And a study of revenge , immortal hate , And courage never to submit or yield , And what is else not to be overcome ? " He handed Conor the volume of Paradise Lost and Conor opened it to the first page where it had been inscribed , " For my beloved student , Conor Larkin , a soldier in dubious battle . " From the moment Liam and Conor left , Finola 's mind was ablaze , for the passing of the land had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to return , but Finola knew it as reality . In her eyes , both of her sons were gone and should be considered gone forever . airy was along his way toward eventual priesthood , spending a great deal of his time serving mass and otherwise in the vicinity of St. Columba 's . This left Brigid to be considered as sole heiress . Plain , religious , hard-working Brigid was toward her seventeenth year and the object of many quiet discussions and subtle plots by the circling hawks ofp294mothers . There were a number of eligibles in Ballyutogue due to inheritland who could do worse than marry the name and get the dowry of a Larkin . Putting two and two together , the answer always came out to be Seamus ' older brother Colm , who , in his late twenties , was just the proper age among the younger bachelors in line for a farm . It was completely logical to Finola that the joining of Colm and Brigid and their two farms should culminate a lifetime of neighborliness together . Total combined acreage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous Catholics in the district . Yet it was a dicy subject , even between such close friends as Finola and Mairead . True to fashion , Mairead stood ready to claw out the eyes of any young thing who got too close to her Colm . If tradition were followed , Mairead would keep him a bachelor even if she becamewidowed in the event Fergus departed first . The idea of sharing her kitchen with another female was unthinkable . Nonetheless , Finola knew Mairead harbored deep and motherly feelings for her daughter and in the event of widowhood there would still be two cottages and things could be worked out so the women would n't get on top of each other . Finola inched into the matter gingerly . To her utmost joy she found her dear friend had been considering exactly Fergus and Tomas knew the workings of their wives ' heads . Besides , it took no particular genius to figure out what they were arranging . Both men gave tacit blessings to the matter . Tomas simply left the possibility of Conor 's return unsaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small detail . Brigid , a sweet and innocent lass , had no idea of the maneuverings and , never having been made a party to it , had germinateda few little seeds of her own . For near on two years , what with Liam in the fields , Conor at the forge , and Dary being kept from menial tasks , Brigid had done thedaily milking and carted it to the crossroad for collection . At the crossroad and under the hanging tree she met Myles McCracken , who was doing the same . The McCrackens had the smallest , poorest , stoniest , highest-in-the-heather farm in Ballyutogue . However , povertydid nothing to detract from Myles 's good looks and in a way he reminded Brigid of her brother Conor . If Their eyes started seeking each other at the daily gathering and after a time they began to arrive at the crossroad earlier and earlier for , without truly saying it , they did so in order to be alone together.  |p295Conversation  came haltingly , with neither of them relating their . growing feelings . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilidhe and when an event such as a wake or weddingtook place it meant they could spend hours together , however never relating their true and growing emotions . Finola , ever on the alert , sniffed trouble over Brigid 's anxiety to get to the crossroad each morning . One day she trailed her as far as St. Columba 's where she slipped into the church and lit a few candlesfor her departed sons . From a vantage point alongside the confessionalshe was able to see the hanging tree and confirm her suspicions . They were mooning at one another like sick calves . Myles McCracken was the worst possible thing that could happen . The family was so poor they had to count the crumbs they threw to the birds . Myles was the middle of seven sons and would n't be inheriting so much as the skin off a potato . " We 'd better be having a talk with Brigid , " Finola announced the very same evening to Tomas . " It 's time we be thinking of making a suitable arrangement for her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've given full consideration with whom such an arrangement should be made ? " " If your eyes could see farther than your pint , you 'd know Colm O'Neill himself is seeking her favor . " " And I suppose you and Mairead have done all the preliminary groundwork ? " " And I suppose there is a better match to be had in Ballyutogue , " she snapped . " And I suppose you would n't be thinking of joining the farms , now would you ? " Finola knew she had to tread her ground carefully , for joining the farms meant acceptance of the fact that Conor was n't coining back , something Tomas would never concede . " No such thing , " she said . " I 'm considering the fact that they make a good couple and have known each other their entire lives . Well , are you for the match or not ? " Tomas flopped his arms . " Jaysus , " he moaned , " I wish Colm were n't such a blister . He 's a real bog swaddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that got to do with marriage ? " she asked . " It had something to do with us once , " he answered . Perhaps a twinge of memory stirred when he said that , but if it did she covered any feelings , pouring tea emotionlessly and pressing herp296case . " If you want to know who she likes , I 'll tell you who she likes . She likes Myles McCracken . " " The tall streaker ? " " That 's who indeed . There 's a bad scant to the entire McCracken image . The whole family together has about as much meat on them as a pair of tongs . " Tomas did n't like that , either . He had been battling with devils of doubt since his sons left and wanted no more of another weighty decision . Myles McCracken did mean trouble . Naive as Brigid was , she could not help but pick up the vibrations around her . Visits on three consecutive nights by Colm unnerved her . He was an old friend , indeed , the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . Now he was making bumbling approaches so even their friendship was in jeopardy . Brigid loved her brother Conor dearly but she knew in her heart he would never return and she began to harbor her own desires about the farm . Her initial caution became an unspoken determination . With the scent of conspiracy growing pungent , she vowed to take a stand on Colm O'Neill . The young people of Ballyutogue plotted to get away from their parents and Father Lynch 's eyes by covering each other 's chores and acting as lookouts at the rendezvous points . The ruins of the old Norman keep had a perfect vista to all approaches and a single watchman could warn a dozen pairs of lovers with a simple bird call . Myles waited at the footbridge just over the stream from the keep . She crossed to him and they held hands and kissed each other 's cheeks , which was fairly minor among the sins , then disappeared into the ash grove . " I 've missed you , Brigid . " " And I 've missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossroad with the milk the last three days I knew she was getting suspicious . " " Nothing of the sort , " Brigid lied . " I 'm just doing some of the heavier work because she 's had a bad back . " " Oh , that 's good that she does n't suspect , " Myles said . " Myles , " she said sharply , " I want you to kiss me . " " Ah sure ! " he answered , pecking her cheek . " No . Kiss me on the lips . " " On the lips ! "  | " Aye , and hold me in your arms while you 're doing it . " He held up his hands defensively and backed off . " My God , have you taken leave of your mind ? It 's very dangerous . We can get into all sorts of trouble . " " I checked with Abbey O'Malley . Her sister Brendt used to do it all the time before she married , even with Conor and Seamus . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could happen ? " " Well , you know . " " You ca n't get pregnant from kissing , " she said . " But it can lead to all sorts of things . " " Will you or wo n't you ? " " You 're scaring the life out of me the way you 're acting , Brigid Larkin . " She flung her arms about him , pressed her bosom close and kissed him fiercely on the mouth . " Holy Mother ! " He reeled back and sat openmouthed on a large boulder . " Did n't you like it , Myles ? " " Surely it 's the grandest thing that ever happened . " " Then let 's kiss some more . " In a relatively short time they got the gist of it . Myles 's mind bent with excitement and his hands were touching her hair and her cheeks and her shoulders and even once or twice dared brush against her breasts . They felt sensations in their throats and stomachs and began emitting wild sounds and perspiring . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping from it , so wonderfullyconfused . " Are you furious with me , Brigid ? " " Oh no , no , no . I never knew anything could feel like this , even praying to the Virgin . " Myles waltzed around dizzily and stamped his feet . " We must be crazy . " " Do you think we went too far ? " she asked . " No , not that . I mean getting serious . We ca n't do that . There 's just nothing I can do for you in this world . " " Myles McCracken , you listen to me . Maybe we ought not to get this aroused in the future , but I do want to keep seeing you . " " Whatever for ? We 're so bloody poor , I could n't even give you the dirt off my neck , we 'd need it for topsoil . "  | " Do you want to see me or not ? " she demanded . He hung his head . For an instant the life half drained from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye . " Brigid ran over the footbridge , past the keep and never stopped till she reached the cottage out of breath . " You 're late , " her mother greeted her . " The butter 's not going to churn itself . " Brigid turned aside to conceal her gasping and blushing . " I 'm sorry , I 'll do it straightaway , " she said , beelining for the byre . " Brigid ! " Tomas called . She froze . " Colm 's to be calling on you tonight . He 's meaning to take you on a ride in a hired sidecar after mass on Sunday . " There could be no mistaking what that meant ! " I 'm not feeling too well , Daddy . I 'm coming down with the throat . I think I 'd better be getting some rest . " " And I think you 'd better be paying a little more mind to Mr. O'Neill , " Finola said . Brigid spun about and cracked out without thinking with the first defiant words against them in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay the attention to him . " And then she became paralyzed at the sound of her own voice . " You 'll not talk to your mother that way , " Tomas said . " You might as well know , " Finola said , " an arrangement is in the making . " " I 'll have no part of it ! " she cried , and fled into the byre . Finola was up with a switch in her hand but Tomas blocked her way quickly . " It 's that Myles McCracken ! He 's never to set foot in this house ! Tomas , you order her to break it off ! " A sense of fright over another disastrous interference with his childrengripped him . Tomas released his wife and slumped down at the table . " I 'll not have that girl defying us ! I 'll put her in a convent first ! " Finola shrilled . Tomas shook his head . " No , " he said softly . " I 'll see Father Lynch and I 'll make them confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you wo n't , " he said softly . " She 's to have her fling with the lad , it will do no harm . " " Are you mad ! " His silence was becoming more confusing than words of anger . " Have you seen the number of girls who go to thep299altar every year with a baby in their belly ? " she thumped . " Is that what you want ! " He looked up with a face filled with yesterday . " I want her to know the feeling of being in love , " Tomas said , " if only once and if only for a little while . It might help later on to know that for one littletime there was a boy desperate for her . She 's got to have that much , woman , she 's got to have that . " When Kevin O'Garvey was first elected to Commons he took a room at Midge Murphy 's boardinghouse off Jamaica Road in one of London 's " Irishtowns " close to the penetratingaromas and singing steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride beneath the Thames to Parliament . Little changed in his way of life during the first decade of Westminster . He graduated to the finest room in the Murphy house and was granted certain privileges that befitted his status . Midge was originally an Aran Island woman , slow in granting friendship , and ran a tight ship with life centering about the kitchen . Few were allowed to visit it except at mealtime , fewer still allowed to linger , and Kevin alone had " freedom of the kitchen . " After supper he used an alcove by the larder as his office . Otherwise , things were much the same . Kevin held nightly court in a back booth at Clancy 's Public House a few blocks away . The saloonwas filled with the lust of Irish dockers where an endless line of countrymen sought his help . Since the death of Parnell , the Irish Party had become a watered-down affair bereft of its former sting , with O'Garvey one of the few remaining eminents in its ranks . A Select Committee was voted into existence by Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abuses to overflowing . With the need of reform legislation growing urgent , the committee was charged to investigate labor conditions in the industrialareas . From the outset O'Garvey established himself as the dominant figure and placed Ulster on the investigation venue . Their first hearings had been in the English Midlands in the Bradford-Leedsarea . O'Garvey was chosen to write the draft report on their findings and rumor spread that it would be devastating . Apprehensionin Ulster grew throughout the industrial community overp300their own pending investigation . Then came a shattering rumor that O'Garvey personally had chosen the Witherspoon &; McNab Shirt Factory in Londonderry as his chief target . Working late at night to complete the draft report , Kevin canceledhis usual evening session at Clancy 's Public House . A few days before the report was completed , one of the lads from Clancy 's showed up in Midge Murphy 's kitchen . " There 's a quare swell looking for you , " he said , handing Kevin an envelope . It contained the calling card of Brigadier Maxwell Swan . He had fully anticipated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely agent . Swan would be particularly interested in keeping the committee away from Witherspoon &; McNab because he was dividing his time these days between Belfast and Derry , setting up a labor spy system in the Hubble enterprises as he had done for Sir Frederick Weed . Kevin gathered up his work , put it away in his room , refreshed himself at the basin , then put on his tattered jacket and walked to Clancy 's . The Brigadier 's carriage was at curbside . As he entered , the tone was unusually subdued , with obvious curiosityover the bald man with the military bearing waiting in Kevin 's personal booth . Everyone pressed forward at the bar in order to get a glimpse in the back-bar mirror . Swan indicated that a confidential discussion might be better held elsewhere and in a moment they drove off , coming to a halt at nearby Southwark Park , then , taking to foot , strolled along the park 's edge in the damp and fogging night air . They came to a stop at a park bench and sat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual informers , " Kevin said . Swan rested both hands on the knob of his cane and looked blandly out to the mounting , eternal fog . " We have to remind ourselvesfrom time to time that Lord Roger is one of your constituents and has the same right to petition you and express his view as anyone else . " " That 's a fact , " Kevin answered , " but I usually do n't meet my constituents on park benches . " Swan smiled steelily and touched the cane to his hat in a salute . " Obviously , we are concerned with the Select Committee 's pending visit to Ulster . " He proceeded to build an articulate case . Industrial Ulster had invested heavily and wagered everything on the linen power loom . With America fully recovered from the Civil War , cot/ton was again in direct competition with linen . Linen was a squirrellymarket at best , and anything that endangered it undermined Ulster itself . An investigation of the Witherspoon &; McNab Shirt Factory , now the largest in the United Kingdom , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . " We think it is in Ulster 's interest if the Select Committee keep out of Belfast and Londonderryand away from linen . " " You 're talking hogwash , Swan . You 're afraid of exposure of your very filthy operations , nothing more . " Swan had suspected O'Garvey 's intransigence in the argument . " Let me make a few practical points , " he said , changing course . " Point number one , " he said , still looking off into space , " Witherspoon &; McNab employs over a thousand Catholic women . It is the largest single employer in Londonderry . Along with the other shirt factories , it is the backbone of the economy . " " Point number one is correct , " Kevin said . " Point two , " Swan continued . " That factory is Lord Roger 's largestsingle profit maker . We are in a headlong race to make our gamblein power looms pay off . Any investigation and subsequent legislationthat would bring profits down to a marginal operation would lead us to close down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . " Kevin O'Garvey shook his head in disbelief and laughed . " Sure I do n't believe what I 'm hearing . You know we investigated six factoriesin Bradford-Leeds and all six factory owners told us the same damned thing . Either let them bleed the workers or they 'll shut down . Take your blackmail elsewhere , man . So long as there 's a ha'penny in it , you 'll operate . " " Suppose I can show you figures to prove we ca n't stand heavy capital expenditures and stay in business . " " Then close down . You 've no call to operate on the premise you 've a right to take it out of your employees ' guts . Conditions in Bradford-Leeds are filthy enough but they do n't start to compare to those slimy , tubercular , deafening , rheumatic linen mills , and what really terrifies me is the Witherspoon &; McNab building . It 's no more or less than a seven-story unlighted bomb . You 've no right to make your shirts monogrammed in human blood , no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well now , " he said , " we 've both stated our points of view . Let 's examine some practical aspects . " Kevin knew he was dealing with an icy number who had n't begunp302to shoot his ammunition . Swan 's surgery in breaking up union organizingthreats had been hangman efficient . As he studied Swan he throbbed to bring his own anger under control . " Now then , " Swan went on , " the Select Committee comes to Londonderry and conducts its investigation . A scathing report is issuedwith recommendations for corrective legislation . What do you suspect we are going to be doing in the interim ? " " Threaten to close down until that bluff is called , then threaten the workers against testifying . " " Yes , more or less . We 'll fight you every inch of the way . Any new bills you manage to get through Commons will come after one , two , three years of arduous and bitter battle . In such situations it will come through as a watered-down compromise and in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumvent . In other words , count on us to go the limit to protect our properties . " " Oh , Lord , " Kevin said , " the dirty scheme Hubble and Weed have laid out for Derry . Everything on two distinct levels . The top level supplies enough good jobs to hold a loyal population in your sacredcity . The bottom level is a manipulation of human beings as so many head of cattle . Instead of putting new industry into a place where thousands are jobless , you deliberately keep it impoverished and leave us scrambling like famished dogs so we literally beg to slave in your death traps for pennies . " " That 's a way of looking at it , rather extreme , O'Garvey . There is an order of things , a system long established . The inheritors of that system are n't just going to chuck it all away . Do you really believe Bogside wo n't be Bogside fifty years from now ? Do you really believe that a few piddly little laws are really going to change things ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land League , " Kevin retorted . " I 've not spent my life in vain because we 've bloody well changed the system on the land and we 'll change it in your dirty factoriesas well . " " In your lifetime ? " Swan asked . " That does n't matter . " Swan flipped his cigar on the walkway and poked it out with the tip of his cane . " Suppose you had an opportunity to change things in Bogside right now ? " Kevin tensed . " Shall I go on ? " " I 'm not on the make if that 's what you 're fishing around for . " " Good Lord , I would n't be foolish enough to try to bribe you . "  | " And why not ? Your people have tried to bribe every man in the Irish Party and not without some notable success . " Swan managed a smile . " Shall I go on ? " he repeated . " Yes , but I very well might get up and leave . " " You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years back in an attempt to finance small business and things of that nature . It fell flat . " " Because you fought us out of fear of Catholic competition . " " Whatever . Suppose the association were refinanced and a private accord made so that several new enterprises could be sponsored in the Catholic community . Further , suppose you could buy , say , fifty apprenticeships a year and it was guaranteed to you the apprenticeshipswere available . What kind of effect would it have in Bogside ? What is your most desperate need ? Pride ? Dignity ? Male labor ? " Kevin O'Garvey was stunned . He had expected almost anything to keep the committee out of Londonderry but not this . Bogside , the mother of desperation where men wallowed without hope and nothingever really was done to dent the poverty or create self-esteem . What Maxwell Swan had diabolically concocted was a crumb of hope . Yet how urgently was that crumb needed ? What was the alternative ? Kevin knew that he would be in for years of trench warfare in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-powerful system operating in their own halls of justice . If he did take up the battle for industrial reform the outcome was beyond his lifetime . Was it a bribe or was it not a bribe to take money in order to give hope where no hope lived ? What was the price ? He knew that abominationslike Witherspoon &; McNab would go on regardless . His fight in the Land League was an ancient one that had kept Ireland in a blood bath for centuries . How dearly they had paid for the successes . The war for industrial reform would be even more bitter . Indeed , could one man do much more than give a ray of hope to his desperate people ? Swan had all the answers , all right . After clearing the Bogside Associationdebts there would be money coming under the table for several years to support small businesses and buy apprenticeships . Why in the name of God could n't this support come from simple human need ? Why in the name of God did the price tag keep women and children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits were . Why ? Because that was the Derry scheme ,  |p304the  Ulster scheme , and any hint of assistance to Catholics was not permitted . It had to be kept secret at all costs . Kevin O'Garvey agonized for three weeks , alternately torn by visionsof the putridity of the mills and the bedlam aspects of the shirt factory . These visions struggled with visions of despair in the eyes of his Bogsiders , tormented eyes that tore at his soul every day of his own life . Whose voice wailed louder ? Hope . . . now ! Hope nowtHOPE NOW ! The House of Commons Select Committee on Industrial Relationstraveled to Ulster on the recommendation of Kevin O'Garvey of the Irish Party . They visited neither Belfast nor Londonderry but the mill town of Ballyomalley , an advanced experimental town establishedby Quaker interests . There they found the best working and living conditions in the province and Ballyomalley was eventuallycited as a shining example of Ulster 's progressiveness . An oasis in the forlorn morass of Bogside was Celtic Hall , the activities emanating from it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviving the old Celtic sports and , with them , a touch of national pride , spread over Ireland beyond expectations . Bogside , in particular , had been a place of poor little Irish vainglorv . Hurling and Gaelic football drew packed crowds on the dusty playing grounds each Sunday after mass . Several years after the GAA , an urban and sophisticated counterpart , the Gaelic League , came into being , spearheading a renaissance of the ancient language and culture . The organizations were legal but everyone knew the GAA and the Gaelic League fronted borderline republican activities in the climate of discontent . Their glorification of Irish history and Irish dissenters ran counter to the centuries-old British attempt to Anglicize the colony . These scents of Irish nationalism were considered dangerous by the Crown as a spawning ground for future Fenian agitators and their activities and more vocal members were kept under scrutiny . Small wonder that Conor 's frequent appearance at the League 's sparse library was greeted at first with suspicion . A brawny stranger like himself could well be a member of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to infiltrate their ranks . One had to be constantly wary of informers , the lepers of Irish life.  |p305Conor  had exhausted every possibility for a job and wanted to move on . Teresa O'Garvey sensed it and communicated with her husband in London and he , in turn , wrote Conor reminding him ofti his promise to remain till he returned from Commons . While he waited , Conor drifted to those places where idle men congregated to make idle talk . They were men like himself , now down to the last ha'penny , so that even the small comfort of a brew was a luxury . After his daily trip to the Gaelic League library he 'd hang around the playing fields watching practice . The regularity of his presence brought about the usual protective inquiries and it was only then discoveredhe lived with Kevin O'Garvey . Once safe credentials were establishedhe was accepted with nods of recognition . " Hey , you , big fellow . " " Me ? " Conor asked . " Aye , we 're short a man for practice . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know very much about the game . " " Have you played it before ? " " A few times only . " " You 'll do for practice . " Conor had played some soccer football , which the Scots introduced to Ulster , and a few games of Gaelic as well . He was strong enough for sure and a hard runner . A pivotal part of the Gaelic game required brute strength within a pack of men where one had to leap higher , grab the ball and be able to hold onto it with surety . It is said the game was old as Patrick and the patron saint may well have had Conor in mind as a mid-fielder . Like most farm lads , he could leap stone walls like a deer as soon as he was able to walk , and with blacksmith 's hands for grip and over-all might of body , his raw materialat six foot and two inches and two hundred and fifteen pounds was formidable . No sooner had Conor stepped out on the field than a blue-shirted regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward stopped , threw out a cunning hip and leg fake , then tried to dance past . Conor was twisted off balance by the maneuver but managed to grab ahold of his blue shirt , snatch him off his feet and bounce him to the ground thumpingly in a most effective , if unscientific , tackle . The runner went one way and the ball went the other as he crawledp306around on hands and knees gasping for air . He staggered to his feet and walked up to Conor shaking his fist . " You stupid bastard ! " he screamed . " It 's only practice ! " " I 'm sorry . Did I do something wrong ? " " You like to killed me , that 's what , you dumb shit . " The man reeled off , still shaky , then stopped and returned . " Hey , I 'm sorry , man , " he said , holding out his hand . " Just a bit stunned , you know . The name 's Pat , Pat McShane . " " I 'm Conor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not at all . I 'll buy you a brew at Nick Blaney 's after practice . " Cooey Quinn , coach and manager of the Bogsiders , observed the Larkin lad keenly as he seemed to pick up the game by the minute . Cooey had been in the GAA from the beginning , one of Derry 's greatest Gaelic footballers , a bandy-legged speedster . After quitting as a player he had built the Bogsiders into a regional power . His years in the sport did little to line his pockets , for it was an amateur sport played for pride with overtones of nationalism . He made for Conor the instant practice was called . " Hello , big fellow , I 'm Cooey Quinn . " " Sure I 've heard of you , " Conor said , introducing himself . " How much have you played ? " " Three or four games at most . We mainly played association footballup on Inishowen with the Protestant teams . " " You in Derry for a while ? " " Aye . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you come out for practice I 'll see to it personal that you get some coaching on the finer points . " " That 's grand of you but I 'm hunting for a job . " " You 'll not find one here , so you might as well get some training . " Cooey studied Conor 's size hungrily , then edged close and spoke in confidence . " Frankly , there 's a bob or two to be made on the side . " " How ? " " Some of the swells around put down wagers on us and if we win ... well , you know . . . " " That 's sure not the way I figured on earning a living , " Conor replied . " Unless you got something better to do , why not give it a go ? " Conor shrugged . " Why not ? " " Good , come on over to Nick Blaney 's and meet the lads . "  |p307The  establishment of Nick Blaney was Bogside 's finest , all done up proper with tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show of local chauvinism , CARNEY 'S DERRYALE , a pretender to the throne of Guinness . Nick was of the sporting crowd , a boxer who had once been number three middleweightin the entire United Kingdom . Except for getting caught cold by a lucky punch , Nick explained constantly , he 'd have gotten a shot at the championship . There were a lot of regulars at Blaney 's , men with jobs and small businesses . The athletes were their alter egos and they were always willing to fill up a player 's glass . " Look at the size of you , " Mick McGrath said , looking every inch the star of the Bogsiders , oaken build and sure of himself . He stuck out a strong hand of greeting . " How much do you weigh , Larkin ? " " I do n't know for sure . I think maybe over fifteen stone . " " By Jaysus , that 's just what we need , " Mick said . " I can vouch for the fact he hits like a runaway beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering . Conor looked over to him . He turned crimson . Pat McShane wore a Roman collar . " Mary save me , " Conor mumbled , " I 've gone and busted up a priest . " With introductions done , Conor got over to Father McShane , still chagrined . The priest rather enjoyed his embarrassment and broke into a smile revealing a pair of missing teeth that indicated someone had gotten to him long before Conor . " I do n't understand this , Father , " Conor said . " I 've studied all the holy Scriptures and nowhere could I find a single word forbidding a priest to play Gaelic football . " " But Bishop Nugent . Does n't he get furious ? " " Only when Bogside loses . " Never having met such a priest , Conor continued to stare puzzled but Pat McShane had seen them come from the country before . The father was cut out of another mold than the indifferent and middlingfodder that filled the seminaries . He had come from new wealth in the south and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the Church . In the next days the comradeship between them became instantaneous , for the two were both strangers of sorts to the world of Bogside . They quickly found that there were poetry and literature to bind them . If Bogside priests were of another breed than the dogmaticsConor had known , Father Pat was different , even among them . On the secret , he was the guiding light of the Gaelic Leaguep308and when Conor was invited to a meeting it spelled his happiest day in Derry . Lookouts were posted at every approach to the abandoned stable on Lone Moor Road . Only when an all clear was given did small groups of twos and threes filter in . They were young , poor and shabby and to Conor 's surprise nearly half were girls from the mills and shirt factories . Once in the stable , they made up the ladder to1 , the loft where heavy burlap shut the light to the outside . The dimness inside made one barely visible . They spoke in low , controlledtones , yet there was an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGrath and Cooey Quinn and was greeted with silent handshakes and nods of the head as he was introducedaround . Maud Tully , a snip of a lass with great brown eyes , called for attention . " Gather in close , " she said , " so 's I do n't have to talk so loud . " The thirty-odd who packed the loft formed a sitting circle around her . " Father Pat just sent word he was called to the bedside of a critically sick parishioner . " A groan of disappointment went up . " He said he 'd get here as soon as possible . In the meantime I 'm suggesting we start a discussion about the subject for tonight , Theobald Wolfe Tone . " They looked disappointedly to one another . Conor had brought along his autobiography of Wolfe Tone when Father McShane told him about the lecture . He held his peace . " Does n't anyone know enough about Wolfe Tone to begin ? " Maud said . As she was again met with a rumble of dejection , Conor raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of luck , " Maud said . " Our new brother , Conor Larkin , has volunteered . Why do n't you come up here , Conor ? " He got up from the floor and moved through them over a buzz of curiosity . His bigness was all the more apparent in the closeness of the loft . Maud pointed to the box to sit on and as he did they gathered in tightly . In that magic instant , he saw them all as Conor and Seamus sitting brightly at the feet of Daddo , eager , hungry to learn . " I hope you do n't think I 'm presumptuous , " he began . " I couldp309never give a talk the likes of a learned man such as Father Pat . " He reached in his pocket and took out the small volume entitled , The Life and Adventures of Theobald Wolfe Tone written by himself and extracted from his journals . Edited by his son , William Theobald Wolfe Tone . " To begin with , " Conor started , " we 've a history in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Protestant ascendancy . It is a tradition from Robert Emmet , Napper Tandy , Henry Joy McCracken , Thomas Davis , Isaac Butt , as well as the very founder of this Gaelic League , Douglas Hyde . Two of these Protestantswere as important to Catholic emancipation and Irish longing for freedom as the liberator , Daniel O'Connell , himself . I refer to Charles Stewart Parnell , whose loss has never been recovered , and tonight I will speak to you of the father of all Irish republicans , Theobald Wolfe Tone . " The room had been struck to a hush . " Wolfe Tone was born in Dublin on the twentieth of June in the year of seventeen and sixty-three , " he continued with a voice not quite comfortable in its task . Yet Conor felt the instantaneous communicationfrom those arrayed at his feet . From uneasiness he moved to a strange sensation of power , for their eyes and ears were riveted to him and he was quickly gaining their minds . Suddenly all of his years of listening to the tales of Daddo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had read in the fields and under the candle began to weave that unique Irish magic into his words and he drifted into touches of fantasy and spice and humor . Conor was in the sudden moment the shanachie and the story came from him as though he had been there himself . By line , verse and chapter he traced the turbulent career of the first of the great patriots : the vow at Belfast to unite Ireland , the flight to America , the influence of the French Revolution , the intriguesin Paris to gain support , the storm at sea that destroyed the French fleet , the second futile invasion try in Lough Foyle , capture , condemnation , the death sentence . . . suicide . The eyes of Conor 's galvanized audience were misted and their cheeks wet , to a person . Dead silence followed for a long time . " Bravo ! " Everyone turned to see Father McShane , who had come up unnoticedand witnessed the last of the mesmerizing performance.  | " One last round , gentlemen , if you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night through with Father Pat but Gooey Quinn and Mick McGrath were slapping his back , introducinghim around and blowing hot air like a tread bellows . " Aye , it was a night , " Gooey repeated for the umpteenth time , " everyone is in high spirit . Now if youse can learn to play football the way youse got the gift of gab you 'll be the unofficial mayor of Bogside , Conor Larkin . " " That is definitely so , " Mick agreed . " I hope not , it 's a curse in my family , " Conor said . " Gentlemen , gentlemen , " Nick Blaney pleaded . From the mustiness of Derryale the four stepped out into the odors and sounds of poverty that lingered like an incurable rash . FatherPat stopped suddenly as though he were afraid to walk through it one more time . The stray drunk urinated at the base of the sacred walls , the vile sound of domestic rancor stung the air , bringing on a discordant cry of an infant who was more than likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , more babies for their numbers than any place in the kingdom . Babies to eat pork scraps and work the shirt factory , babies to pitch ha'pennies against the wall , babies to grow old and wait to die in bare monklike cubicles . Father Pat gripped Conor 's arm for an instant to steady himself . " If there was only something we could do , " he whispered . " I 'm breaking out of here one day , " Mick said . Conor nodded . " Sure , " Gooey said , " that 's what youse all say . " " Mind my words , I am . " " Going our way , Father ? " Conor asked . " I 've got to check on my parishioner . I 'm afraid he 'll get away to-night . " Conor and Mick watched Cooey and Father Pat disappear down the muddy street of doll-size row houses as a choir of starving cats shrieked their discontent , then turned up their collars against the chill and made up Lecky Road . The wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue of the Reverend George Walker with finger pointed into the half-moon , the constant guardian who scorned the dregs down in Bogside . " Gooey thinks I 'm going to rot here , he 's crazy . Only trouble is there 's just about nothing I can do . " " No skills at all , Mick ? " " I was a butcher 's apprentice once , nothing much other than that.  |p311I  waited four years for an opening in the building trades but it came to naught . . . but you mark my words , I 'm not going down in this place . " Mick jerked his head to steal a glance over his shoulder . " Shit , Conor , " he whispered , " we 've been followed from Blaney 's . " Conor looked back . A pair of constables behind them slowed down , then inched up toward them . " Somebody 's put the finger on you already , " Mick said . " What for ? " " The talk you gave tonight . I bet they figure you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the block , split up and run for it . " " Ca n't , " Conor said . A second pair in plain clothes holding batons in their hands approached from their front so they were boxed in . Mick took off his belt from his trousers and wrapped it around his fist , leaving the big brass buckle dangling loose as a flail , and at the same time bent down and snatched up a stray paving stone . He nudged Conor and in unison they turned around and ran straight at the two pursuers , catching them off guard . Conor blocked the baton with his forearm as Mick sent the buckle splaying into the policeman 's face . He screamed , clutching the rip that ran from eye to mouth , and dropped to his knees . Mick put him down and away with the paving stone . The second constable jumped Mick and caught him two , three times with his baton and he dropped and , as he stood above him , Conor slammed him between the eyes . Conor tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able the second pair reached them and he was pounded to the ground by hissing batons . " Fenian bastards ! " As Mick struggled to his feet a boot slammed into his stomach , choking off his breath . He gagged and vomited . Conor reeled up , struggling back to ward off the rain of blows , half of which found his face and ribs . He sagged away but as they turned on the fallen Mick McGrath a rage welled up and he returned , driving his fist into an attacker 's belly so hard it lifted the man off his feet . He pulled Mick to his feet . The lad 's front was covered with blood and vomit . Conor held one arm about him and the other fist stuck out warningly at the remaining constable , who looked at his three semiconscious mates , started as if to attack , then turned and fled as Conor dropped Mick and squared off to face him.  |p312Lights  and shouts went up and in an instant the Bogside was alive with police whistles . The Constabulary attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning Gaelic League suspects , but the hospitalizationof three constables was the talk of Bogside . The assortment of broken noses , cracked ribs , stitches and missing teeth in the three-minute encounter was awesome . A face-saving story was leaked that the policemen had been jumped by a gang of a dozen ruffians . So far as the authorities were concerned , the incident was officially closed , but it did not die among the Bogsiders , who knew what had really taken place . For several months after Kevin O'Garvey returnedthere was a flourish of new businesses financed with loans from a suddenly revitalized Bogside Association . A bakery , two pubs , a draying service , a ropemaking plant , a print shop and a cottage industries retail store were all launched with ceremonial fanfare . In addition , a dozen new apprenticeships were strangely available at the shipyard , the fishery , and in the rail roundhouse . These were sold for the first time to Catholics and financed by the Bogside Association . A sliver of light had penetrated the gloom , and since as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of briskness . Frank Camey , the flamboyant member of the association 's threemanboard , gloried in his role as benefactor . He was Derry 's most successful Catholic , owner of the brewery and a wheel in municipal politics . He displayed his success visibly with brocaded vests , waxed grooming and gold wherever possible on watch and chain , cuff links , rings , teeth . Carney 's self-esteem was bottomless , for he had come up the hard way through Bogside . Although many of his dealings were questionable , he maintained loyalty to his own and devotion to his Church . Father Pat McShane , the youngest and second member of the board , merely blessed the new Bogside enterprises and sent them on their holy way , leaving the showmanship up to Carney . The Bogside 's most ardent champion had been Kevin O'Garvey , just as he had been the most tireless worker for the Land League . Yet Kevin seemed to get little joy from the burst of activity . Conorp313noticed right off that during his absence something had changed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and Father Pat talked about it and concluded that the years of turmoil were taking a toll and perhaps Kevin was aging , a thing they did n't want to believe . Conor was not so sure of the real cause , but he knew that his friend was not himself . When Conor was summoned to the Bogside Association Board in Celtic Hall and told to work up a set of figures to finance a blacksmith shop , it was a crack of a miracle , for he had been prepared to move on . After his astonishment at the sudden turn of events abated he dived into the matter and found the abandoned stable on Lone Moor Road suitable and cheap to house a forge and reckoned he could save greatly by making most of his own tools . Yet there was a problem . Conor wanted a loan several times higher than had been granted to the other new shops . There had long been need for a first-class forge in Bogside and he envisioned something more than just another smithy . He wanted not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of hardware , but also to go after his calling in the field of decorative wrought iron . Father McShane and Kevin O'Garvey agreed after only minor balking and budget trimming . It was Frank Carney who blew through as the enthusiast . He had long been chief sponsor of the football and hurling teams and , after all , Conor Larkin was a rising sporting figure . The forge should become the Bogside Association 's showpiece , he reckoned . Some deep breaths were held but the loan went through . Business was reasonable from the start . Mick McGrath and two other lads from the team were given the first real jobs of their lives as apprentices . Conor was eager to get going on his hardware but was hampered because his men were novices and there was a complete shortage of skilled Catholic ironworkers . He reached across the River Foyle and hired a Protestant , Tippy Hay , as his foreman to run things and train the apprentices while he turned full time to develop product . Tippy was an excellent craftsman , too old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graving Dock where he had labored for thirty years . He was given enough work to keep alive in peak seasons but had otherwise come to lean times and had gone heavily to the bottle . The man proved so grateful for the second chance , he moderated his tippling enough to carry out a decent day 's work and proved to be an excellent teacher.  |p314Ti|p|py  was called back to Caw &; Train on one of the periodic emergencies from a ship disaster and told Roy Bardwick , the dock director , to stuff it . A few weeks later he was found unconscious in the street and was hospitalized . The first rumor had it that the devil 's brew had finally gotten to him but physical evidence of a severe beating changed that story to say it was the work of an avenging gang of Catholic thugs . Tippy refused to name his assailants . It was not until several months later he blurted out in a drunken stupor that his old mates at Caw &; Train and lodge brothers in the Orange Society had warned him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of his disloyalty was required . Notice was posted that Conor Larkin would be toleratedonly so long as he kept his proper place . Unable to find a suitable replacement , Conor doubled his own workload to some eighteen hours a day and eventually put out a line of wares : claw hammers , files , knives , axes , adzes , augers , bits , reamers , hinges , nails , scissors , latches , bolts , doorknobs , weather vanes , wagon and tack hardware , shovels , tongs , cranes and what the women used in their kitchens . The quality was the best in Derry and the price lower , but Conor was unable to place his goods in the betterretail stores outside the Bogside . He sold on the premises and , despitea tacit boycott , Protestants began to trickle in , for saving money was non-sectarian and an old Scottish trait . " Try at Larkin 's , you might find it there . " " Larkin will make anything up for you special and the price will be right . " Sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . There were growls of wariness over the same Conor Larkin who had been involved in a known Fenian activity and perhaps a scuffle with the Constabulary , yet his success grew moderately . At the end of his first year , Mick McGrath and the other two apprenticeshad moved up several notches to take on responsibility for some of the less skilled aspects of the trade . Of the other two blacksmithsoperating in the Bogside , one died and the second , old Clarence Feeny , sat down with Conor and figured he could make out better as the Larkin foreman than on his own . When he came in Conor inherited all of Frank Carney 's brewery work , which encompassedthe stable , teamster wagons and considerable barrel making . Clarence Feeny 's son became one of two new apprentices and soon a dozen men were employed , including a salesman and a Brayingservice.  |p315With  old Clarence there to move along the day-to-day work , Conor was free to pursue his longed-for goal in the wrought-iron field . Frank Carney opened the way by commissioning a grille and gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral . The work proved so lovely that Bishop Nugent himself ordered a wroughtironpulpit , the first in that part of Ireland . Following Bishop Nugent 's lead , a series of commissions followed from churches as far east as Limavady and as far west as Ballyshannon . Conor did n't particularlylike the church work , for he envisioned a lot of Father Lynches taking it out of the egg money of the parishioners , but there was no way he could turn it down . Entering his second year , the forge had made a small but definite inroad . This was even more apparent as a number of the Bogside Association'sother businesses had folded . Life was tolerable in Derry if one were Conor Larkin . He entered a small , select , non-sectarian circle of intellectuals based around Andrew Ingram , Father Patrick McShane and the faculty at Magee College . A reasonably decent cultural life was imported under the sponsorship of the Countess of Foyle , Lady Caroline Hubble . In the Bogside , Conor had become a well-known figure in the Gaelic League and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mick McGrath brought him up to a savagelyeffective player and the possessor of a never empty glass of Derryaleat Nick Blaney 's . With Conor Larkin in the middle of the pack and the ball floating down toward him , his hands were iron sure and the power of his body was intimidating . Once an opposing runner was in his grasp he had to expect punishment . The sporting crowd bet on him heavily and a small but steady source of income came back to him along with the free drink . Conor worried about this , too , as he had worried about his church commissions , but Pat McShane assured him that his presence among the derelicts as their alter ego was more than a fair bargain . In the mire of Bogside , men gambled and drank to blur reality . They wagered with money . They wagered without money . Gambling was a way of life just as losing was a way of life and the loan shark was a way of life . Evasion of the rent and rate collector was a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Men lost their pride and languished in foggy dreams . Conor Larkin and Mick McGrath were heroes in a hero-starved landscape . For the moment he seemed at peace and even cast his eye aboutp316for a permanent relationship . There was Maud Tully in the Gaelic League , who had the keenest mind of any female he had ever met , and Gillian Peabody , a Protestant schoolteacher with all the polish and charm of a high-bred lady . One or the other was his usual escort to the cultural affairs . There were others , all possibilities . For the moment , Conor Larkin had lulled himself to believe that he had beaten the Bogside and the Derry scheme . Andrew Ingram 's own success ran parallel to Conor 's when he was appointed district superintendent of the national schools from Strabane to the south and as far east as Dungiven . On opening night of a ten-day Shakespearean Festival , Enid Ingram greeted Conor at the door of their home on Academy Road with a look of despair . " I 'm afraid you 're stuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Andrew is clear up to here in paperwork . " " Ah , that 's a pity . Well , they 'll be repeating King Lear at the end of the festival . " " I hope he 's finished by then . I sometimes wonder why he took the new appointment . By the by , when I heard you were coming by yourself , I gave Andrew 's ticket to Gillian Peabody . I hope you do n't mind . " Conor grunted and smiled at her slyly . " Not up to any skulduggery , are you now ? " " Of course not . Besides , you could do a lot worse , " she said , rappingon the door of her husband 's study and entering . The burden of the new position was visible in his face . He greeted them , scoffing over the demands of administrative work . " The annualbudget and contract bids , " he said , slapping the thick ream of paper on his desk . " A fine way for a scholar to spend his dying days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Enid said , leaving Andrew and Conor to exchange knowing glances . " Enid 's a woman . The sight of a happy bachelor bends her female blood . She 's backing her own horse in the Conor derby , " Andrew said . " Gillian 's a nice girl , " Conor said , " but I 've already seen her this week . Not to worry , we 'll have a grand time . " " Take your time , Conor . You 're in a position to choose your own potion . Of course you could do worse . " The jibbering of the ladies reached their ears from the foyer . " Conor , before they come up . "  | " Aye ? " Andrew took off his specs and rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands and nodded to the stack of contract bids . " Would you drop in after the play ? I 'll still be working . There 's something I want to discusswith you . " Andrew Ingram raised his eyes from deep thought as Conor opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He nodded for Conor to shut them in and make himself comfortable . As Conor slipped his jacket over the back of the chair , a bottle of scotch whisky and two glasses appeared from the desk . " I want you to look at this , " Andrew said , shoving forward a set of bound papers . " What is it ? " " Ironwork for the district schools and recreation grounds for the next two years . Desk repairs , fences , hardware , flagpoles , new railings . As district superintendent I am also a member of the Londonderry Corporation Council . This second booklet here is the city 's iron bid , light poles , benches , wrought-iron work . Includes the municipal and Constabulary stable . " He paused and sipped at his whisky . " I have a feeling if I touch these I may be married to them , " Conor said . " I want you to look at something else . " A third booklet was handed Conor . " This is the bid entered two years ago by Caw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present contract . " Their eyes rested long and hard on one another before Conor looked to the old bid . Andrew Ingram shoved his desk lamp nearer and raised the light , casting a shadow of Conor off the back wall of the office . He opened the cover and glanced down the first page for a few seconds , then set it down . " Well ? " " It was a bit high , " Conor said . " A bit ? " " What do you want to know , Andrew ? " " How high ? " " They 're stealing you blind , " he said , leaving the chair and walkingto the window , shoving the lace curtain aside and staring down at a passing carriage . " How much ? "  | " If the rest of the figures are the same as on that page , they 're overcharging by more than fifty per cent . " " Want to read the rest ? " Conor shook his bead no . " Caw &; Train has been in operation since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as for all the school districts in the western half of the county without a single challenge to their bid in forty years . " " Let me try to guess what you 're thinking , " Conor said softly . " What kind of shape is your forge in ? " Conor shrugged . " Can you handle it or not ? " Conor turned from the window . " That 's not the question and you know it . They subcontract more than half the work to the little shops around the Waterside . Anyone can do that . Is this closet worth opening ? I 'm doing just fine as it is . " " Let me put it to you this way . I can open a new school in Dunnamanaghwith what we can save on this contract . They 've beenwaiting there on promises for eight years . They 've an enlightened priest and he 's promised me a starting class of forty students . " " Look , I 'm in debt up to my eyes to the Bogside Association . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's in London . " " How convenient . " " I 've got a dozen men and their families to feed . You 're close to Lady Caroline . Why do n't you ask her to intercede for your new school ? " Andrew 's face grew taut and he leaned over his desk , pointing a ruler like a teacher . " Because education is not a Hubble charity . Moreover , no new school should be the object of a conspiracy . This whole place reeks with deals made behind closed doors . " " For God 's sake , I 'm just getting on my feet , Andrew . " " Sorry I brought the whole thing up . " " Mind you , I 'm not a coward . " " You do n't have to explain , Conor . It 's one thing to dream of insurrectionin the lofty mountain air of a booley house . You 're getting to be a big man here . " " And yourself , Andrew . They 'll snuff out your whole career like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is my career , Conor . All I know is that every child in this county could have beenp319educated on what they 've stolen to create a false prosperity in order to pay off and hold onto loyal subjects in Londonderry . That 's Ulsterism , Conor Larkin . Of course I 'm not an idealist of the Gaelic League or an Irish alehouse revolutionary like yourself . I 'm just a plain old schoolteacher . " " You 've no right to talk to me like that ! " " No , I guess I do n't . I suppose a year of comforts can water down one 's rage over injustice . " Conor snatched up his glass and downed its contents and glared at the stubborn , needling , hurting man opposite him . He poured anothershot and did that one in as well , then hung his head , standing in the center of the floor , and tried twice , three times to argue but no words came out . He edged back to the desk , sat and turned the booklets around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " Conor said . From the moment Conor entered his bid , he kept a watch on the forge by rotating a guard among the four apprentices . A simple but effective alarm was rigged up to set off a steam whistle if the doors and windows were tampered with . It could be heard at Celtic Hall and the recreation grounds where the small army of loiterers was always about . The whistle went off for the first time in the middle of the night several hours after the Londonderry Corporation Council opened the sealed bids . Frank Carney had tried to slip into the forge and was in a boil . When calm was restored , Frank made up the ladder to the loft where Conor lived . " Why did n't nobody tell me about that goddamned whistle ! " he demanded . " I 'd have gladly disconnected it if I 'd have known you were going to make a two o'clock visit . " Frank roared about in the quarters cluttered with books . His gold and lacquer did n't shout out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeese , I thought you were a smart kid . Well , you 've gone and done it . I 've been talking myself blue in the face to the Caw &; Train people and the Corporation Council for four solid hours . What the fuck were you thinking of ! "  | " The only sin I 'm guilty of is catching a thief in the act , " Conor answered . " Come on , you 're talking to me , Frank Carney . We 've got to live with those people , boy . This shit 's got to get undone . You 've got to cancel the bid . " " I do n't see why . " " You dumb son of a bitch , where have you been for the past year ? You 've broken all the rules . " " They 're not my rules and I do n't intend to live by them . " " Oh , you do n't , huh ? " " No , I do n't . " " Then stuff this in your craw , Conor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't making no goddam bids like this withoutour approval . We 'll put you out of business just like we put you in . " Hold on , Frank , " Conor said softly . " If I had known there were deals attached to the loan , I 'd never have taken it . If you 're saying that you made deals about this forge behind my back , then close me down , man . " " I swear I do n't believe you ! All of life in Bogside is one big deal . how the hell do you think I operate my brewery ? Do you think I own seven public houses on the Protestant side of the river because they like my Irish wit and charm ? You do n't have to spell these fuckingthings out . It 's a way of life , man , and only a smart boy can make his way through it . " " I 've never been accused of being smart , " Conor answered . " Bullshit ! You want to be a hero with all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fucking hero now with this bid ! " Carney grabbed at his pulsating heart and slumped to a chair gasping for breath . " Get this straight , Larkin , " he gasped , " I ai n't getting closed down on account of you . I ai n't going back after how far I 've come . " " Why do n't you pat a couple orphans on the head and give the Bishop a pair of golden candlesticks and tell everybody what a good Catholic you are ? " " You goddamned son of a bitch ! " Carney screamed , lunging at Conor . His blows were warded off harmlessly , then Conor grabbed him by the lapels and exerted just enough strength to get the messageacross and Carney went limp . " You 're out of shape , Frank , you should n't exert yourself . " Carney reeled back grunting , then clutched at his roaring stomach.  | " They 're looking to me to straighten out this mess , " he snarled . " I 'm talking to the Caw &; Train people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . You either get in line or I 'm closing you down . " " Be careful going down the ladder , Frank , do n't fall . It would be a great loss . " Conor Larkin walked the night out skirting the sacred bastions , then went along the strand of the River Foyle . He stopped for a momentas he always did at the customs station and remembered the day his frightened brother emigrated , and he wondered more heavily than ever if it was not the bottom line for them all . Past Magee Collegethe way opened up , the old road to home . Dawn found him at Madam 's Bank between Pennyburn Light and Crook Lighthouse at the last bend of the river . Derry looked so peaceful from here in its rolling rhythm of chimney-potted slate roofs . The four-faced clock on the Guild Hall tower was heard faintly tolling the noon hour as he continued to look out aimlessly from a bench on the city gardens bordering Madam 's Bank . " Morning . " Conor peeked over his shoulder to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I found you here once so I figured you might be here again . We all have our favorite meditation places . " " Looks so peaceful from here , " Conor said . " How 's Frank ? " " Oh , he did a monumental amount of bloodletting . The vote of the board of the Bogside Association stands tied as of the moment . One in favor and one against C. Larkin 's ill-advised bid . Frank realizesthat Kevin will go along with me , so he 's been with the Caw &; Train people all morning trying to salvage his ass . " " I should have known all along he was buying his way into heaven . " " Frank 's the ultimate corruption of the system . Natives taking jobs from the colonizers is against the primary dogma of Ulsterism and all civilized rules , old chap . Obviously , you knew what you were doing when you did it and Frank is n't going to get his throat cut followingyou . " " How do you feel about it , Father ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not what I asked . " His boyish face looked away with a certain longing as he pon/dered . " My first reaction was one of resigned sorrow . Are n't things bad enough without taking this on ? But that moment passed . It had to come to this sooner or later and somehow I always figured you were going to be the one to pull the switch on them . " They got up and walked along the rose path . " Andrew Ingram , there 's a lad , " the priest said . " Are you worried about him ? " " Him ? No . He 's figured it all out a long time ago . He 's like my daddy , quiet . I 've been thinking about my daddy most of the night . He did n't do it once , he did it a hundred times . I remember him walking alone across the diamond in Ballyutogue to cast the first vote in our lifetimes . Tomas did it without singing his own praises . He lives revolution in his own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkin . All my life I 've prepared for a certain moment and said to myself , if there was only something I could do . The momentcame and I choked with fear . I said to Andrew , Go crawling to Lady Caroline , do anything , but do n't get me involved , a contract bid is n't the kind of insurrection I fancy . ' He saw right through me , Father Pat ; I 'm a public house patriot , one of Ireland 's vast number . " " I told you I groaned inside when I heard about the bid , " the priest answered . " It 's the same thing as you felt . We all lose sight of who we are and why we 're here . Sometimes after a few brutal scenes down in the Bogside I limp back up to my room and look down on that dirty place and I think of how I 'd like to be an ordinary man seeking ordinary pleasures . " " You 're just buttering me up , Father Pat . " " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a tin replica . Do you think the idea of a woman has never passed through my mind ? " Conor was suddenly seized with the reality of the human hells the man bore and the strangeness of it awed him . " It 's neither sin nor failure to break in a moment of anxiety , " he continued . " The only failure is not to recognize what you 've done and let it slide by . Frank Carney has arranged a meeting between you and Roy Bardwick , the director of Caw &; Train . Will you see hlhi ? " " I 've got to know if anybody on the board made any kind of deal about my forge ? " " I did n't . That leaves two . Chances are Kevin did n't . That leaves one . " " It will do no good to meet with him , " Conor said.  | " Nor will it do any harm . You 're his peer now and I do n't think you should start off by doing to them what they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and hidden in Frank Carney 's chapel in the cathedral . The room was filled with dull-eyed ornate statues of Roman paganism . Father Pat opened the gate in the grille , letting Conor in , then left . They studied one another . Bardwick was a big man , almost Conor 's size , and would have been if his seventy years had not stooped him a trifle . His head was thatched in white but his grip was firm as they shook hands . For a moment the scene reminded Conor of his own daddy meeting with Luke Hanna to bargain , to maneuver for a little air to breathe for his people . Roy Bardwick was old but infinitely calm and certain of himself . " I know you , Larkin . I 've seen you before . " " I worked at the graving dock over a year ago for a few weeks duringan emergency . " " That 's it , when the two Canadian sail steamers hobbled in from a storm . I never forget a face . Let 's get down to cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the dark about your bid . " " Frank 's telling the truth . " " It was you and Ingram , then . " " Maybe . As long as we 're opening on a note of candor , what about Tippy Hay ? " " It was n't my doing , Larkin . I personally like old Tippy . On such matters things are understood . You do n't have to issue written or-ders . " " On the other hand , " Conor said , " you did nothing to prevent it . " " Why should I ? " Bardwick said , his toughness becoming apparent . " Who are you speaking for ? " Conor asked . " Everybody , including myself . While I was sitting here waiting for you I was after thinking , How do I go about this ? No use making threats because if you were the kind of man who yielded to them you 'd never have made the bid in the first place . I 'm thinking we 'd better talk straight . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know what Ingram 's after . Now let me tell you what I 'm after personally . I 'm seventy and I retire on full pension in two years . I 've put in over forty years at the dock , fromp324the day it was built . If I let that work get away , it could jeopardize everything . I ai n't talking about the money , only the principles . Do you see my point ? " " Aye . " " As for Ingram , the Corporation Council is willing to re-evaluate its budget in regards to new school development . He 'll get his school in Dunnamanagh next year . " " That leaves me and Caw &; Train , " Conor said . " Taking Carney at his word that this was your doing and you 're being obstinate , we all sat down and figured a reasonable approach . Some of the lads wanted all-out war . I did n't . Maybe there 's a new scheme of things coming but we ai n't ready for it . My people get very jumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going to do any of us any good , we 're making a proposal . We want you to either withdraw your bid or do n't contest it when it 's declared null and void . The Corporation Council will find a technical reason , lack of facilities or something like that . The Caw &; Train bid will stand . As you know , most of this work is subcontracted . All the small forges around Waterside have depended on this income for thirty years and we have to take care of these people . " " And my cut ? " " Out of the remaining work which is done at the dock , I am willing to subcontract twenty per cent of it to your forge . " Conor glanced at a bloodied Christ in the marble arms of a doeeyedVirgin . His hand traced over the sarcophagus . The escape was there ! He could come into a windfall without a bloody nose . The rationaleof live and let live was almost palatable and by any accountingit would have to be considered as a victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid would stand . Who would pay for it if not his own people by substandard lives ? It would be another conspiracymade in a dark place and , although an inch had been given grudgingly , the system would remain in all its foulness . Bardwick unfurled a handkerchief and blew his nose vigorously . " As I said , Larkin , I 'm not going to try to intimidate you but you 'd be a fool to think you 're home free if you turn it down . Go along with this for a while until my people get used to the idea of competi-tion . " " For two years , when you 're out of it ? " " I do n't give a shit what happens after I 'm retired . " " When I was a boy , " Conor said , " we had an old squire in our district . Family had held the seat in Commons for generations . Canp325you imagine the threats and breast beating that went on when a Land Leaguer challenged him ? Give us time to get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the time had come for a change and the Land Leaguer won and life went on . Sorry , Mr. Bardwick . " The old man , who had looked into the face of many challenges , did so again without a show of anger or menace . Time had told him what he had to do . He had tried to avoid it , but he knew he would go through with it . " I 'm sorry too , " he said . As the bids were published and the contract awarded , Conor kept careful watch . Weeks turned into months with work fully launched on the school and city iron needs . Most of the Protestant forges in Waterside received the same work they had previously done under the old Caw &; Train subcontract and their fears were quelled . Only at the graving dock itself and affiliated Orange Lodges did the rancor continue , and long memory was the most integral item of Ulster life . St. Sinell had a particular identity in Derry 's Bogside . On St. Sinell 's Day there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor one of Ireland 's twelve apostles . It happened to come on the same day that the Bogsiders ' Gaelic football team traveled to Enniskillen for the season 's big traditional game . Because the two events were in the same general locale , a special train was chartered that all but emptied out the Bogside . Clarence Feeny 's oldest boy , Ahern , was the apprentice scheduled to stand watch at the forge that day . The foreman had noted his son 's unhappiness during the week . Clarence had fallen behind schedule on a commission church work as well , and on Friday told Ahern the good news that he could travel with the team and Clarence would stand watch . The fire was concise . Conor Larkin 's forge burned to the ground minutes after it erupted . The alarm bell never sounded . An imported arson expert from Belfast failed to note anything that hinted of foul play , although evidences to the contrary were abundant . In sifting through the ashes , hundreds of small tools which would not burn were missing . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The coroner 's report stated that Clarence Feeny most likely had dozed after setting the fire accidentally and was caught in it . The inference was that he was a heavy drinker and more than likely intoxicated at the time . Although the corpse wasp326nearly destroyed , the report failed to mention the skull was found bashed in in four places . A week later all remaining work under contract to the LondonderryCorporation Council and the national school district was transferred to the Caw &; Train Graving Dock . A year of penance had done little to heal Kevin O'Garvey 's wound . Whispers about had it that he had never really gotten over Parnell 's death . Whatever brought on the change remained a secret and at times only Father Pat and Conor were able to get close to him . Kevin deplored the deal he had made with Maxwell Swan almost from the moment he made it . His walks through the Bogside by night always brought him before the Witherspoon &; McNab Shirt Factory , where the acid of guilt eroded his innards . His file of complaintsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanswered , for he had sealed their avenues of protest . The price had shown him making a bad bargain , for few of the Bogside Association enterprises prospered and many faded . The apprenticeshipsthey purchased made no impact in Bogside 's chronic unemployment ailment or economic betterment . Kevin entered the Georgian mansion on Abercorn Road that housed the headquarters of the Earl of Foyle 's enterprises . His step was visibly slower . He stopped , as always , for a damning look down the street to the seven stories of lightlessness , airlessness , filth and danger , an aboveground dungeon that housed the shirt factory , and the stone in his chest became heavy again . Ground floor of the mansion contained a bland collection of white-shirted , green-eyeshaded male clerks and long-skirted women , all in rows and rows . An assistant whisked him upstairs to the dour office where Brigadier Maxwell Swan occupied a cracking leather chair . They exchanged minor amenities . Kevin stared from the window to the view of the river . Like so many things in Donegal , it was picturesque from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterway . From this vantage the perspective changed , for the rot was everywhereand the flaws showed like an old whore without her cosmetics . He turned back into the office , wiping his specs and seating himself wearily opposite Swan.  |p327The  Brigadier had harbored many hours of second thoughts over his compact with O'Garvey . Few men had been able to intimidate him , neither tough labor leaders , Fenians nor colonial rebels . He had cut men down and he , Swan , was the only one who could stand nose to nose with Frederick Weed . Yet O'Garvey annoyed him . Perhaps he had made a bad judgment , a miscalculation . O'Garvey 's record showed the full anathema in his life of threats , physical beatings , imprisonment , excommunication from his church . Nothing had deviatedthe man 's will or changed his direction . . . except that bribe . Maxwell Swan thought himself extremely clever in detecting a flaw in O'Garvey , who spilled great salt tears over the men in the Bogside , and Swan had exploited that by throwing a few crumbs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there had been no repercussions and O'Garvey had kept the Select Committeeinvestigation out of Derry , he could not help but feel he had n't come out of it cleanly . Obviously , a cloud of conscience continued to hover over his co-conspirator . The torment of O'Garvey showed in deepened crow 's feet about the eyes and a sallow , pinched face . Maxwell Swan was rightfully disturbed by what he saw . " Who did it , Swan ? " Kevin said . " The leader of one of your more proficient goon squads out of Belfast was seen across the river two days before the fire . " " I did n't realize you were a detective along with everything else , " he answered . " You have to be when you have coroners and so-called arson expertsfrom the Royal Irish Constabulary on your payroll . " Swan took up his military best , his deep voice rolling out words with surety and his blue eyes of a caliber to slice steel . " What 's the difference ? You know damned well we 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract leaving Caw &; Train . You 've got to share the blame , O'Garvey . You should have told your people what the rules were when you gave them loans . " " Oh , most of them knew that , all right . That 's why their businesses failed . " " I ca n't take the blame if your people are incapable of operating a simple shop or two . " " Of course they 're incapable ! They 've been made incapable by generations of subjugation ! I lied to those men . I said , Here 's a few quid , set yourself up . ' But they never had a chance when you couple their ignorance with the fact you cut their windpipes by **26;3466;TOOLONG . And I lied even worse to those women across the street in your abominable sweatshop and I 've wept with shame every time I 've walked through the Bogside . I should have screamed in protest when it was in my power . " Swan cleared his throat . " I ca n't be responsible for your morbidphilosophies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " Perhaps not , but I 've got the power to take you down to hell with me . " " I think you 'd better be careful . " " What for ? Letting my life 's work end up in a deal with an animallike you ? " Swan managed to conceal his reaction but , never having known araw clutch of fear before , the feel of it was pure terror . He was stricken with the same kind of dryness he had inflicted on a thousand men before . He wanted water but he knew if he reached for it he would reveal a trembling hand . He shrugged at last . " Do what you damned please . " " I intend to , " Kevin answered , coming to his feet . " Let 's talk , " Swan uttered , amazed by his own sudden failing . " Our little scheme , yours and mine , " Kevin said , " has succeeded in giving a few men dignity . Now that they 've tasted it , no matter how infinitely small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your strangle hold , here and now . You went at the one man , Larkin , whohas said , Look , lads , be proud of yourselves , ' and you set out to destroyhim . But you 're going to rebuild his forge and you 're going toreturn his contract . " " Or what ? " " Oh yes , conspirators always have little things hidden in their pockets . " Kevin threw down an envelope containing the story of his deal to accept a bribe in exchange for keeping the Select Committee away from the shirt factory . " Would you like a half hour to read this ? " " Never mind , " Swan answered , " I know what it says . " " And you know where the original copy of it is ? " " With some journalist in London , I suspect , with instructions on when and why to open his copy . " " It 's good to work with a man like yourself . It saves so much time in explanations . " Swan weighed it feverishly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his role in it . How much damage could the Hubbies and Weeds sustain ? Nothing between himself ,  |p329Lord  Roger and Sir Frederick was in writing over the deal . If it were exposed , Swan knew he would have to shoulder the entire blame in order to save his bosses . He would be finished if he tried to turn on them . Moreover , he had carried out far too many covert duties not to know what Weed would do to him if he turned rat . The brilliantly honed veneer of Maxwell Swan splintered and the iron beneath that collapsed to dust . He had faced other fanatics beforewho were ready to go to the wall but never one who carried such a counterthreat . O'Garvey seemed only too delighted with the prospect of his own self-destruction in order to purge his soul . ' What queer stroke had taken him to O'Garvey in the first place ? In the end he might save the shirt factory and some of the industrial filth but at the same time he was opening Londonderry to economic competition . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations would sweep into Parliament and bring about just the very legislationhe attempted to block . Certainly Witherspoon &; McNab would be targeted at once for investigation . He should not have played with O'Garvey because men like him enjoyed getting strung up for their dirty little causes . Swan , the manipulator , had manipulated himself into a noose . " The Larkin forge will be reopened and the contract returned . I want all copies of this masterpiece returned to me and your assuranceyou 'll not author another . " " It 's a pleasure to do business with you , Brigadier Swan . " Kevin put on his hat . Swan welled in an unprecedented surge of rage . " You know what happens to men who go back on their word ! " " Yes , I rather suspect I do . " " You know if you cross me it will mean your life . " " I know . " " You seem only too anxious to throw it away , so if you go back on this , I promise you , Larkin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the day . " " I know , " Kevin whispered . " And from now on , keep your people in the Bogside where they belong ! " " I 'm afraid they might not listen to me . Good day , sir . " Swan fell into his chair with the violence plunging as quickly as it rose . " O'Garvey , " his voice trembled . " Why ? " " Why ? " Kevin said . " My father whom I never knew followedp330Daniel O'Connell , our liberator . He followed him with the same adorationI followed Parnell . O'Connell and Parnell were men of peace and decency without a violent bone in their bodies . Their reward was a trail of betrayals , and final destruction by your filthy lying Parliament .

I 've only now come to realize that it will be the only way to throw your fucking asses out of Ireland . " 1897When the villagers of Ballyutogue exhaled , they did so wailing with grief . However , when they inhaled , they sighed silently with relief . Blessed Father Lynch had fallen to a sudden and fatal heart attack . Their outward display reached sorrowful proportions as ReverendBishop Nugent , rigid with age himself , tolled the final mass . After their priest of four decades was put under , a big dark cloud lifted from the parish and floated over Lough Foyle toward Scotland . Father Cluny , who was elevated from curate , was an infinitely gentler man and , without Father Lynch about to prod him into petty tyranny , a blissful peace prevailed . Brigid Larkin approached her twentieth birthday , which meant her twenty-first was not far behind and that was a time of uneasiness for most unwed girls . Once a lass crossed that line , spinsterhood loomed large and the number of spinsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the object of all those plots and schemes . Her battle of wills with Finola took on aspects that marked the Larkin stubbornness and the ugly trait of living together in silence . Her affair with Myles McCracken stagnated from sorrowful encounter to sorrowful encounter . They continued to meet secretly , hold hands , lament in circles of despair and then depart unfulfilled and morose . Every so often Myles had his fill of it and would tighten up with anger and refuse to rendezvous or threaten to leave Ballyutogue andp331Brigid became swept up with fear . The only way she knew to pacify him was to permit a few uncontrolled moments of passion which were shut off abruptly when they reached the threshold of the most mortal of sins . Each such scene was followed by days of gnawing frustration . Brigid grew increasingly nervous , short-tempered , and was given to sudden spells of semihysteria . Finola said that it was the work of the fairies , that Brigid was being invaded by them . After a time Brigid began to believe it and question her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was too terrified to confess the sins she had committed with Myles . This added to her unhappinessand she was among those who inhaled the most deeply with relief when the old priest died . At last , she thought , she could go to Father Cluny . She picked the day of her confession with deliberateness and marched to St. Columba 's . Once through the door , with no turning back , she trembled at the gravity of having withheld her sins . She prayed that she had not truly gone mad as her mother suggested , and that some miracle might intercede for her and Myles . At the end of a long shopping list of favors , she also prayed for the strength to resist having sex with Myles until they could be married. " 0 Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God , my dear guardian angel , and all you blessed angels and saints in heaven , pray for me , that I may make a good confession and from now on lead a good life , so I may join you in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Consumed with tears , she recited an act of contrition twice for having offended God . She prayed herself into a trance and , thus mesmerized , entered the confessional and knocked weakly . The little door opened . " Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . Father , please forgive me , for I have been sinning for three years . " Father Cluny 's high-pitched voice could not be mistaken . " This is a grave thing you are saying . What is your sin , my child ? " After a desperate period of silence during which ideas of escape flitted through her mind , she cleared her throat and leaned ever so close to the little door and whispered . " Please understand , Father , I have confessed all my other sins regularly , all that I could think of except for the sins in this particular matter . " " I understand , my child . " " Father , " she croaked , " Father . . . "  | " Yes , my child . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have engaged in givingimpure looks and touches to a boy . I have . . . kissed . . . and embraced . " " I see , " the voice answered grimly . " With just one boy ? " " Of course only one boy ! " " Now how many times have you done this with this boy ? " " Before coming here today I made my best effort to recall . I must have met him on one hundred occasions . Half of these were in secret places . To the best of my recollection , I kissed him at least twenty times at each secret meeting . " " Let me see , my child . That would be a thousand kisses , more or less . " " At least , " Brigid concurred , taking Father Cluny 's word . " Tell me , my child , were they of a deeply passionate nature ? " " Oh yes , very passionate . And I had been giving him impure looks for two years before I kissed him . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh dear . " Her voice quivered . " He touched me a few times .. . not more than twenty or thirty . . . and only for very short periods ... and . . . and . . . I touched him . . . once . . . well , two or three times . " " Is that it ? " " I have thought unchaste thoughts so many times , I am unable to count that high . " " When was the last unchaste thought you had about this boy ? " " To be honest , just before I came here to confess . " In the ensuing half hour Brigid made full disclosures , which includedrolling in the grass and hay with him , pressing her body to his deliberately and enjoying it to the point of allowing further liberties on her breasts and three times between her legs , however with clothingin between . Since the death of Father Lynch , Father Cluny had been receiving a great number of retroactive confessions . Some were more serious than this , some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general amnesty rather than have half the parish serve penance . Their crops might rot , what with all that praying . Only two days earlier Father Cluny had heard the confession of a young man who clearly matched up to the one he had just listened to and allowed as he had heard from Myles McCracken and Brigidp333Larkin . It was becoming a great sport for him during meditation to match up confessions . At any rate , things would not be dull in the parish confessional for some time to come . Tomas Larkin was alone in his home and dependent on Brigid for a heavy share of the labor . A new century was coming into focus and , with it , new hope of sorts , but that concerned him little . His sons were gone and one by one friends were being laid down in the St. Columba graveyard . So many of the young men had left and so many of the old had become world weary . Death reached beyond the mere taking of people . The scent of it filtered through the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old and worn as they . During a day Tomas looked over his shoulder a hundred times out in the fields as though he were expecting Conor , or even Liam , to be coming up the path . He lived on memories of Conor 's hand in his own and Conor 's intent eyes fixed on him joyously and filled with love and awe . And his step slowed . More and more time was spent in the sweat house to drive off the rheumatic demons that had stiffened his hands and kept his back in constant pain . One day a whisper spread over the bog as it would with the presence of an intruder . Although Father Cluny was hardly an intruder , the only time he was seen in the bogs was during an emergency . He wended his way down the cut until he found Tomas , who unbent himself , set his slane aside and walked with the priest to a patch of scrub oak out of earshot . " Thank you for coming , Father Cluny . " " I think the appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomas laughed . The priest had blossomed into his own man since Father Lynch took leave and was rather an enjoyable fellow . " My presence here with you has started all sort of gossip and I 'm more than a little curious myself , Tomas . " " Aye , " Tomas said . " Meaning no disrespect , I do n't think it would be entirely in order for me to enter St. Columba 's and it is a grand day for a walk . " " The ground appears to be quite neutral , " the priest agreed . " Now mind you , Father , I just want to chat . I 'm not confessingbut I need counsel and I find you a piously adequate man . " Father Cluny nodded with inward delight , noting that this was ap334giant step for Tomas Larkin and reminding himself not to appear sanctimonious . " It 's like this , Father . I 've made a bloody mess of things . " Tomas licked his lips and sighed Irish . " I 'm after making amends before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of amends , Tomas ? " His eyes moistened . " I guess even I know that Conor is n't coming back . The time is past for me to keep on fooling myself . There are amends to make . You see , I took the lives of my sons into my hands and the results were ruinous . What I have to tell you now must be kept in great confidence . " " You have that confidence . " " I 've been having dizzy spells , and spells where I almost go blind . I 've managed to keep it from Finola and Fergus O'Neill as well . " " Do n't you think you 'd best go down to see Dr. Cruikshank ? " " Ah , that 's not so important . What will be with me will be . Whatis important is to set things right . I want Liam to come home and Iwant him to have the land . Would you write a letter for me ? " IFather Cluny got to his feet awkwardly , for he was a hefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose face remained downcast . " What about Brigid ? " the priest asked . " I 'm doing all this for her sake as well , " Tomas answered . " It is acertainty Finola will survive me and she will never accept the McCracken boy . However , when Liam returns and takes over the farm , Brigid will have to give up her ambitions for it . Now , I 've a few quid saved and Conor 's doing well in Derry . Between the two of us we could raise passage for Brigid and her lad so the two of them can marry and get away from here . " Father Cluny tried to follow the reasoning . It sounded simple , but yet . . . " I do n't know , Tomas . It 's a dicy plan . So many things can go wrong . " " What else can I do , Father ? " Not the most inventive of men , the priest could come up with nothing better . " I 'll write the letter to Liam for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now , that 's a good man you are . I only wish I could be there in New Zealand when his priest reads it to him . He 'll be one happy lad . " Tomas got to his feet unevenly and in that moment Father Cluny realized the deterioration that had taken place . Tomas Larkin  |p335seemed  to be aging before his eyes . He looked wearily up the path to the bog and the ever waiting spade . He had told himself over and over he would keep going somehow until Liam got home . Then perhapshe 'd rest a bit . " I want to try to make friends with Dary , too , " Tomas said . " You see much more of him than I do . He 's a good lad , you see , despite certain problems in his raising . I 've come to realize he 's going to make a fine priest , a fine priest . " This sudden acknowledgment to the Church puzzled Father Cluny , who studied Tomas with suspicion . Tomas had more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Just then Tomas crossed the line with his decision . " There is one more matter , " he said . " Speaking just now of Dary happened to remind me of it . I do n't know how to put this to you , Father , but if anything should happen to me , well , let me put it another way . Finola has had to share my life and , although things have not been entirely right for us for a long time , we once had something wild and grand . The least I could do for the woman who has shared my bed is to seek absolution . I 'll do it for her sake . So you know that if I fall sick you can go right ahead with it . " " Tomas Larkin , you 're not telling me the truth , man . " " No , no , it 's the entire truth , " he insisted . " No other reasons to seek absolution ? " " Well , I 'd like to rest next to Kilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal like that . " " Come now , Father , you 're the priest . It 's your duty to give me absolution . " " I 'll give it to you but you 'll take it here and now and you 'll be coming to church for the rest of your days . " " Ah , Father Cluny . You 're all alike . Now do n't go trying to make an example out of me . " " You know I would n't do that . " " So why do n't you give it to me just before last rites ? " " In the first place , you 're not telling me the complete truth of why you want absolution . In the second place , I 'll not have Conor raging at me the way you raged at Father Lynch at Kilty 's funeral . " Tomas scratched his jaw and grumbled . " I do see your point . " " Very well then . You will be seen regularly at mass . I 'll not have the parish whispering behind my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , aye . I see your point . Let me give the matter further consid-eration . " " Surely , there 's no hurry . Now , if you 'll come to my house tonight we 'll get on with the letter to Liam . " Conor was unconscious by the time he slammed into the ground . Cooey Quinn charged onto the field with a squad of stretcher-bearers as excitement from the spectators reached an epidemic high . Conor was lifted by five puffing bearers , slung awry on the stretcher , which promptly ripped from age , and he crashed to the ground . Under Cooey 's frantic directions , each of the other five grabbed a dangling arm or leg and dragged him to the sideline . Mick McGrath , the second party to the collision , crawled on his hands and knees moaning . He was fetched beneath the armpits by a pair of teammates and slid off the field and plopped alongside Conor . Mick tried to rise but went down face in the mud . " Resume play ! " the umpire shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cooey cried , waving smelling salts alternatelyunder the noses of his stars . " Ah , wake up , lads ! Wake up for Cooey , would yousel Goddammit , stand back , everybody , and give them room ! " Mick unglued his eyes and waved his head around and was just getting in tune with the ringing in his ears when Cooey slapped his face . " Who am I ! " Cooey demanded . " Shiiiiiiuuuut ! " Mick wailed . " Shiiiiiuuuut ! " Thundering feet rumbled the earth as play swung perilously close to the fallen warriors . Cooey stepped before them , waving them back lest his lads get trampled . They rumbled the other way . Mick came about slowly , glazed-eyed . He swished about to gather up all the loose blood floating in his mouth , spat it out and , with it , a tooth , then studied Conor and began to approximate events . In another moment Conor responded to smelling salts and propped up on his elbows . Both of them were greeted with buckets of water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideline shaking a fist at the officials , yelling to his faltering team , swearing at the opposition , then back to Conor and Mick , imploring . In another moment Conor successfully gained his feet and pulledp337Mick up by the jersey just in time to see the Strabane Eagles score on the Bogsiders with a clean goal to take the lead . Dr. Aloysius Malone was convoyed through the throng , stood on tiptoes and peered into Conor 's eyes , then Mick 's . He asked a numberof questions ; for instance , who were they playing , what were the names of their brothers and sisters , their teammates , and several catechisms . As he did , the knot on Conor 's head grew egg-size and , as it went up , his eye went down to a slit . Strabane grew fierce in the absence of the Bogsider stars . " Hey , Mick , " Conor said , " what you say ? " Mick smiled and blood squirted from his mouth . The pair of them trotted back onto the field of play and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy at the same time he screamed to them to be careful . The inspired Bogsiders rallied , but the game ended in a tie . Nick Blaney 's bar looked more like a slaughterhouse than a pub , as sportsmen and players of good cheer gathered to congratulate each other before the GAA banquet to celebrate the all-Derry finals . Cooey Quinn elbowed into Conor and Mick , bringing a dandy with him , looking as grim as if he had been visited by a banshee . " This here 's Derek Crawford , " he said with obvious unhappiness . " He wants to talk to youse both . " The dandy was a big man and his hands were knobby and his face busted up to indicate he had been a warrior of some sort in the past . " Can we go some place private ? " he asked . They worked their way out of Nick Blaney 's slowly , backslap by backslap , then down the road to Conor 's newly rebuilt forge . He dismissed the guard and gave some attention to Mick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped his foot up on a low anvil . " Great game , " he said . " Did Cooey tell you who I am ? " " No . " " Derek manages the East Belfast Boilermakers , " Cooey said . The mention of Ulster 's most prestigious rugby team received the desired effect . It was the club of the Weed Ship &; Iron Works , the only professional team in Ireland , and nearly as illustrious as the nationalteam itself . " I 'll get right to the point , lads , " Derek Crawford said . " I 've been touring the province scouting out new talent . We 've signed on three lads from the national team , the same team that won Ireland the triplecrown by whipping Scotland , England and Wales in a single season . Needless to say , the Amateur Union is hollering and screamingp338over that and just as needless to say what kind of a team we 'll be fielding next season . I 'm hereby inviting you two gentlemen to Belfast for a tryout and I 'm wagering you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mick garbled through puffed lips . " We 're not rugby players , " Conor said . " Anyone who can play Gaelic , we call it garlic "  --  he paused and waited for the laugh  --  " can learn league rugby . We 've a junior club , more or less amateur , but you 've every chance to be on the Boilermakersquad before the end of a season . " " Holy Mother , " Mick repeated . Derek Crawford painted an exotic picture . There would be a guaranteedjob at the shipyard for a quid a week minimum and they would be paid ten bob a game ( under the table ) while they played on the junior club . Later , when they made the big team , the pay was a quid a game and bonuses for winning . Mick , whose head had n't been exactly right since the crash , almost fainted at the size of the offer . Crawford went on with his non-stop pitch , glorifying Sir Frederick Weed 's determination to have the greatest club in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual team tour of the English Midlands .. . in a private car of the Red Hand Express train . Conor said nothing . Cooey was fearfully uneasy . " Oh , it 's a powerful offer , " Mick said . " Yeah , what about Catholics in the shipyard ? " Cooey snapped . " When it comes to the Boilermakers , we 've only got one religion , winning . Almost half our lads are Catholic . I got no personal use for the sectarian shit and so long as you 're on the team you 'll have a decentjob and have no problems at the yard . What 's more , if you give us a few good years , your bread will be baked . Sir Frederick always retires his lads in style . " Conor grabbed Mick 's sleeve before he could agree . " We 've got to talk it over with Cooey , " he said . " Sure , lads . I 'm at the Donegal House till tomorrow morning . Do n't , for God 's sake , allow this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful mistake . " At the banquet in the social room of Celtic Hall , two lads from the Strabane Eagles and Mick and Conor of the Bogsiders were named to the County Derry team to carry their banner into the allIrelandplayoffs . By a flip of the coin , Cooey Quinn was chosen asp339manager , with the loser as his assistant . While brotherhood waxed supreme as befitting a celebration of County Derry 's co-champions , Mick and Cooey sat through it as though they had lost their favorite sisters . They maintained morose silence and ugly glares until the call for the late train to Strabane emptied the room , leaving behind a minor shambles . Conor nodded to Father Pat , who closed the door after the final reveler had departed . Mick made an attempt to slip out but his way was blocked . " I ai n't staying here and talking as long as Cooey makes me feel like a shagging traitor . " " Well , that 's what you are , " Cooey retorted . " Maybe you did n't hear the speeches tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of our games . Look around the room , Mick McGrath , at them pictures on the wall , if you will . That 's the meaning of it , man , us playing our own games in our own country and not going off and playing fucking British games . . . excuse my words , Father , but I 'm like to breaking inside . " " Bullshit , " Mick retorted . " Bullshit , is it ? Insulting the ideals on which the GAA was founded ai n't bad enough , but what about running out on your mates when we 've a crack at the Irish championship ? It 's a sellout and you know it . " " I 'll bust your head in , that 's what ! " Mick blabbered through bloated lips . " Hold it , hold it , " Father Pat said . " You 're getting a bit thick , Cooey . " " Oh , is it now ? You should have heard that sweet-talking Derek Crawford . He took those two lads from the Strabane Eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county team . He doesn'tif give a shit , excuse me , Father , about us . I asked him to hold his trials till after our playoffs , but do you think he 'd do it ? He 's pumping a lot of hot air about jobs you 'll never see . " " I 've checked into his claims , Cooey , " Father Pat said . " It 's a professional team and they ca n't hold trials during the winter , that 's obvious . He would n't give Mick a round-trip ticket to Belfast unless he was serious . " " Them tickets do n't cost him nothing . His boss owns the railroad . " " Shut up , Cooey ! " Father Pat demanded . " What do you think , Conor ? " " It does n't concern me , I ca n't leave Derry , " Conor said.  | " Thank God someone around here has some loyalty , " Cooey retorted . " It 's nothing to do with loyalty , " Conor said . " I 've got a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " Mick pleaded . Conor shrugged . " Well , answer him , Conor , " the priest said . " In a year or two I was envisioning Mick becoming foreman of the forge but if the talk was between the two of us alone , I 'd tell him to get the hell out of this place . I think you ought to go , Mick . The welcome mat will be out for you here if you do n't make the Boilermakers . " The blood drained from Cooey Quinn 's cheeks . Squat , bandyleggedCooey was thirty-seven , beyond dreams . At his best no one would have offered him a shot at the Boilermakers . Gaelic football ? A poor boy 's game played in weed-covered stony fields for the collection of ha'pennies . A pub full of yesterday 's heroes hustling drinks . Cooey would go on driving a draying wagon and his wife and kids would work at the shirt factory till they emigrated or died . Yet the Bogsiders were the pride of his life . Nae , the only thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had discovered and made players of Mick and Conor . It was he who had given them their Irish identity that they seemed so quick to dump at the first offer from bloody strangers . " Why is it , Father Pat , " Cooey snarled , " every time we have a man of substance in Derry , he 's got to up and go ! " " Because in Derry all a man can hope for is to reach the upper level of stagnation . " Cooey seemed crushed and Mick McGrath began to cry . It was partly comic because of his bloated mouth . Then the tears became doubly sad because they gurgled from a tough stocky kid who had spilled very few of them in his life . Conor tried to comfort him but he pushed away and stood with his face to the wall and beat his fist against it . " See what you 've gone and done , Cooey , " Conor snapped . Mick spun around . " Goddammit ! Look at me ! I 'm nearly thirty and all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge . Jesus , at least I 've got to try . You got no right making me feel like a shagging traitor . " " Cooey Quinn , " Father Pat said , " dreams in this place are bashedp341around enough . You ca n't stop a man with a fighting chance to see one day in the sun . " " What about my dreams , Father ? " Cooey said . Gooey looked around the thready walls at the photographs of raggedteams . In a passing flash he was able to envision himself for a single instant as he did so many times alone with his own thoughts on the delivery wagon . There he was , his photograph on the wall , larger than the rest , and alongside that a framed account of his prowess . COOEY QUINN , the Belfast Telegraph headline sang out , STAR LEFTWING OF THE BOILERMAKERS AFTER THREE SCORES IN A SINGLEIIANDED DEFEAT OF THE BRIGHOUSE RANGERS . IRELAND 'S MOST FAMOUS RUGGER ON A TEAR ! COOEY QUINN , CHEERED BY THOUSANDS ! GOOEY QUINN , A NAME THAT WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jabbed him in the ribs . " Like Conor says , you 're always welcome back . Come on , Mick , let 's go down to the Donegal House and see that Crawford fellow . " Father Pat and Conor braced against the nip in the air as they made automatically in the direction of Nick Blaney 's . " And you , Conor ? " " I do n't know , Father . It ca n't end here , can it ? " " The Bogside gets to us all , sooner or later , but it 's part of Ireland , maybe it is Ireland . " One by one they left , all the lads who had an iota of spunk , unwilling to settle for the upper level of stagnation . Letters from Seamus O'Neill had been a conduit to the outside world , taunting him . He tried to keep the peace he had found , but the life pattern warned him off . Those rows of half-tumbled shacks , the muddy streets , the desperation to avoid sinking , the despair that sapped any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own success and each new evidence of that success added weight to the millstone . Mick would have his go and perhaps return with enough reflected glory to fill him for a lifetime . Was Derry all of Ireland in reality ? Was it the end of the line ? He stopped for a moment and stared at the forge , all rebuilt in brick with a full load of work . " Is that you , Conor ? " the apprentice boy on guard called . " Aye . " " Ali , good you 're here . " As he entered , his sister ran into his arms and seized him . " It 's Daddy ! " she cried.  |p342It  was not only the smallness of Ballyutogue but the peeling off of all vestiges of past beauty . She had turned white-haired overnight , shoddy with age . Even the Protestant Townshipand their grand farms showed signs of erosion . Conor Larkin walked up from the diamond along his childhood path , hurt by the deceit of his memory . The national school was shuttered . Mr. Lambe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filled with cumbersome work and operated by a stranger who had come from over the water . The hanging tree was dying . Dooley McCluskey had aged so , he questioned Conor for several moments before recognizing him . Brigid had warned Conor to see Father Cluny before coming to their cottage and the priest told him to prepare for a drastic change in his father , then fetched a letter . " This came in response to a letter I wrote for Tomas last year . As you can see , it 's taken several months for the round trip . A few days after I read this to him , he just collapsed in the fields . " As Conor opened it , Father Cluny left the room . Christchurch , New Zealand May 3 , 1898Daddy , It has taken a measure of time to answer your letter which arrived a number of months back because my nearest priest is in Christchurch a long ways from where I am . The priest writing this is Father Gionelli , who is Italian but Catholic and begs to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my passage on a big ranch near Dunedin . I thought I would be there for two years but Conor has been sending me money so I was able to pay my passage off early . I started saving right away . Things are different here because the government is after having good farmers and they are making good land available at low prices with loans . I 've told you it 's different than at home . You do n't believe it , do you ? We not only have no landlords or estate agents , but no one has even heard of gombeen men except the Irish immigrants . People here are mostly British but they do n't act like it be/cause they are really nice . Them and the natives who are darkcoloredpeople even get along all right . At the end of last season I was able to make a payment on some land and get a loan for the rest . I do n't know if you 'll believe this but the government even loaned me money to stock sheep . I know you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost a thousand head . I 've been able to build a small homestead , keep up with my payments , and I 'll own my farm in just another eight years . Sometimes the land reminds me of Inishowen because it is so green , but the soil is better and there are n't so many people . There is a Catholic family about fifteen miles away . They are English , but good Catholics , and they 've this one daughter named Mildred . I 've been courting and I 've spoken to her family . We are going to marry as soon as sheep shearing season is over . It 's queer because even though it is May we 're starting winter because things are upside down . Mildred was educated by a convent in Auckland and when we marry she will write letters for me more oftener . I like to cried when I got your letter . I 'm so thankful you wanted to give me the farm but I do n't want to ever leave New Zealand . Tell Ma I say the rosary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred marry we 'll have a Catholic home and she should n't worry after that . Say hello to all my old friends . Say a specialhello to Brigid and Dary . I paid Conor back some of the money and will send him more after shearing season . Here is some money for you . You can change it for Irish money at the post office . Your son , LiamTomas was in a deep sleep . Even preparing for the worst , Conor was shocked by what he saw . He embraced his father softly . Finola 's old bachelor cousin , Rinty Doyle , had been taken on as a hired hand and slept in the byre . Rinty said little , stayed out of everyone'sway and seemed to echo a house about to fall . He saddled a horse for Conor , who rode off to the Township seeking Dr. Cruikshank . Diabetes , the doctor told him . The laboratory results were conclusivelygrim . The condition was apparently terminal , for no known medication could change the chemical balance that had been destroyinghis body . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease at least a year before and it was a miracle the man had not already fallen into a lethal coma.  |p344Tomas  could be kept comfortable and alive , perhaps for years , but it would require sending him to a hospital in Derry and keeping him under close regimen . Thank God , Conor thought , there would be enough money between himself and Liam to see it through . " You have to know , " Cruikshank said , " this disease is virtually incurableand the victim is wide open to infections his body is unable to combat . So far he 's been adamant about leaving his home . " " What will happen ? " Conor asked . " The alternatives could be blindness , loss of limbs , heart and kidneydisease . That is no way for Tomas Larkin to go . Get him to come to Derry . " " I 'll do what I can , " Conor promised . Rinty Doyle fixed a pot of tea while Conor sat by his father . Rinty was a peaceful little man willing to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still able to turn in a decent day 's work , enough to keep things going with Brigid and Finola . Fergus and the other villagerssaw to it that Tomas ' fields were kept up . As Tomas stirred , Rinty slipped off . Tomas mumbled in his sleep . Conor turned his cover back as his father broke into a sweat . His arms were filled with boils and a rash and thinned for the loss of appetite , and his breath smelled of telltaleacetone . " Conor ? " " Aye , Daddy . " " Is it truly you or am I in another of my fantasies ? " " I 'm here , Daddy . " " My eyes are poorly . Give me your hand . " The grip that was once all power was fragile . He ran his fingers over Conor 's face . " How are things in Derry ? " " I 'm faring well . " " Did you ever hear about that letter I got from Liam ? " " Aye . " " Six hundred acres that boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that something to sing a song about ? And what a good brother you are helping him out . . . . I 'm always so thirsty . Would you be so kind ? " He propped his father up . Tomas gagged from his attack on the water . " It 's the sickness . My insides are fairly rusted from all this water I 'm drinking . " Tomas rallied minute by minute , forcing hisp345eyes to see , and a smile returned to him again and again . " I guess you know Finola took in Rinty Doyle . " " Aye . " " He 's a fair enough old crack but I never could figure for the life of me what manner of man would be content taking orders from a woman and sleep for the rest of his days in a byre . Ah , I should talk . Look at me . Living through the great hunger just to give in to a woman 's sickness . " " On with you . They 'll be making hay in the new century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes said to his son , " If I want to . " After another drink he fought for his thoughts . " I saw something awful happening on the land before I was done in by this sickness . I saw a steam machine down in Ballyutogue being tested out by his lordship 's people . Can you imagine a steam machine plowing fields ? It was doing the work of twenty men and they say it will be able to do other things as well . " " You 'll never see the day a machine can dig a lazy bed , " Conor comforted . " Aye , but a machine doing men 's work . Maybe I 'll be leaving this world in the nick of time . What does it really mean ? " " Surely , I do n't know the answer to that , " Conor lied , for he and Andrew Ingram had talked of it by the hour . " I think I know , " Tomas whispered . " It will be the end of us in time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can a man say otherwise ? " Tomas answered . " If a machine does the work of twenty , then nineteen must give up their farms and move into the city . Those who move to the city will not be making their own cloth as we do or building their own homes or growing their own food . They will have to buy everything , and in order to do so they will have to work in factories on other machines which make the things they have to buy . It 's mind-bending , Conor , but machines on the land are our death knell . Everything we fought for out here will be gone . The machine will do what the famine and the British together were n't able to do . And the cities will grow bigger and uglier and dirtier . " " You 're talking too much , Daddy . You 'll weary yourself . " " I 've been waiting to talk for three years and if I wait much longer it will have to take place in heaven . Conor , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daddy ? " " Father Cluny is a credibly pious man and spiritually adequate . He 's become my best friend next to Fergus . Conor . . . Conor .. . I 've taken absolution . " " Are you sure , Daddy ? Are you really sure ? " " Aye . You see things differently at this end of the path . " Conor stared about the wee bedroom of his birth and the birth of his brothers and sister . It was edged in growing darkness . He opened the window for a flight of air and the new lace curtains Finola had put up danced into the room . " Why , Daddy ? " " I 've not exactly told Father Cluny the truth , " Tomas said . " He has to remain after me and I did n't want to add to his own bur-dens . " " Why , Daddy ? " " I owe it to my neighbors . We came into the world together and we lived together . There was some joy , but for those who remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , all of them . If I can show them now that I 've seen God , then I 'll leave them a legacy , something to hang onto . It might make things just a little easier for them to get through to the end . . . . I ca n't leave them all alone without hope . . . . " " I understand , Daddy , but look , man , you 're not getting out of here so quick . I swear to that . " " Ian Cruikshank is a fine man , a fine man indeed , but he does n't lie so well . And while we 're at it , I 'll not go to any hospital in Derry , thank you . " " You 've got to go . " " I 'll not go to any hospital in Derry , thank you . " Conor gripped him . " I do n't know what Cruikshank told you . " You 're not as sick as you think . You 're sicker . " " Jesus , lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Then stop making so much fuss about it . I 'll be in Derry with you and I 'll see you every day . " " That part of it 's tempting , indeed . " " Then you 'll go ? " " Ah , Conor , how could you wish your daddy to a dark hospital ward ? I ca n't leave my land or my friends . " " No , dammit , listen to me . If you do n't come to Derry , do you know how it 's going to end ? You 'll go in pieces , your eyes , your toes ,  |p347your  fingers , your heart . Is that what you want ? " Conor trembled to choking as his voice gave way . " I 'll not see that ! " Tomas reached for him and smiled once more . " Look at us going around like a chicken who just laid an egg . You know I ca n't leave . You know that , do n't you , lad ? " " Aye , " Conor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's settled . Will you be able to stay for a time ? " " Yes , Daddy . " Tomas said no more . He was at peace . He knew by strict orders of Dr. Cruikshank it would be fatal for him to drink alcohol . He would go into a coma from which there would be no mortal return . Tomas had kept a pint of poteen hidden under his mattress for such a possibility . He pondered about receiving absolution , then deliberately poisoning himself , for suicide was a grave sin . He reckoned he would be in purgatory for a long time and once there he could sort things out and argue his case . But he need not concern himself with that just now , for Conor was with him and would stay . The days passed with Conor and Dary standing watch over Tomas and during those long hours Conor related to his brother the full story of their daddy and Kilty as well . Dary had long ago figured out why there had been a remoteness between himself and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself accountable . For the moment there was a resurgence of the love and family strength that had once made the Larkins unique . At first Conor was distressed by Tomas ' absolution . Then it softened . He had made the most intimate friendship with Father Patand come to know other kinds of priests , Bogside priests , priests engaged in secret activities of the Gaelic League . A great deal of his resentmentagainst the Church had modified . Father Cluny , in constantattendance and comfort to Tomas , added to the air of compromise . In the end , Conor accepted his father 's wishes but likewisevowed it would never be for him . He was quick to grasp the undercurrent of struggle between Brigidand his mother , for the change in Finola had been nearly as dramaticas that in Tomas . She had completely given in to fears that the fairies had invaded Brigid 's mind and were plotting day and night to steal her land and cast her out in the cold . During Tomas ' waking hours he never failed to bring up the matter of getting Brigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the misery he had brought on his children . Conor broached the subject with Father Cluny but the priest seemed vague , fearing he was in violation of confessional informationand fearing a wrong decision , as well . Of a morning a fortnight after he arrived , Conor watched Brigid leave in the direction of the Norman keep , a rendezvous place over the bridge well known to him from his boyhood . He turned the watch over to Dary and made after her . Brigid was pacing nervously , awaiting the arrival of Myles , when Conor slipped across the bridge and made an unexpected appearance . " It 's all right , " he said . She looked about , a frightened deer , poised to break and run , and edged toward the bridge speeding her steps . Conor caught ahold of her midway over . " Calm yourself , girl . I want to help you . I want to help you and Myles together . " " You ca n't just barge in once in three years and take over running everyone 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and you do n't count time as minutes on a clock or miles of an ocean . " Brigid tried to shove past him but he held fast . She wrung her hands , then sagged . " I 'm daft . Have n't you heard , I 'm daft . The fairies have me . " " It 's Ma who 's gone daft . She 's trying to make you think you are . The reason you 're so nervous and jumpy is because you 've been denyingyourself perfectly normal desires . " " They 're not normal ! " she cried . " They 're sinful and I 'm being punished . " Conor 's modification of bitterness toward the Church reversed again to anger and outrage . He uttered a string of oaths , smashing his fist into an open hand , then grabbed his sobbing sister and shook her . " You 're a normal , decent , wholesome human being with normal , decent , wholesome desires of any girl of twenty . You want to make love to your lad . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I ca n't listen to that ! " Even weeping in the strong arms of her brother and wanting to believe in his words was unable to dent two decades of building the holy fortress that locks out reason and locks in guilt . At last her weeping subsided . " You do n't think I 'm mad , do you , Conor ? "  | " I do not and you are not . " She became tranquil , took his hand and they walked back over the bridge to the big rock she had shared so many times with Myles . " Darling , you 've got to stop playing this game with Ma . The way she is now , she would n't trade a thick penny for a thin one . You 'll destroy yourself if you keep it up . For God 's sake , is it Colm O'Neill who you want ? " " I ca n't even stand the sight of Colm any more . " " And why should you ? You 've a strong , handsome lad who loves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acres of this rock pile . I want to bring the both of you down to Derry . I 'll teach Myles blacksmithing . " Brigid got away from her brother and shook her head no . " Why , why ? What 's to lose but a dirty game with an old woman who 's gone daft ? " " I hate Derry , " she said . " The sun there has no warmth to it . It does not kiss you like the sun of Ballyutogue . When it 's hot it bums the skin off your back and melts the gravy from you . The rain gives no after sweetness . You swog around like your feet are anchored in clay and the air hangs thick over Bogside like breathing in clouds of a dust storm . I 'm afraid of Derry . I 'm afraid of the bonfires and the drums over in Waterside and of the ugly brawling and men and women screaming at each other and their children covered with sores and the eternal sadness of it . Ah , you 're meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there will be no work for you or Myles and he 'll stand against the wall and pitch pennies while I go up to the shirt factory or muck someone 's toilet and the honor and manhood will fade from Myles 's eyes . " Conor flopped his arms . Oh , Lord , he cried to himself , oh , Lord , she is so right . He came up behind her , took her shoulders once more . " If it 's land you must have , lass , there 's all you want in New Zealand and Liam there to start the two of you out . But go from here while there 's still a chance . " " Nae , Conor . This farm might not have been good enough for the likes of you but it was good enough for three generations of Larkins and , by the holy Virgin , I 'm as much a Larkin as any of us . " He turned her around , cupped her face in his hands . " Would it be worth losing your lad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is n't like you , unafraid to go marching off into the dark unknown ? I 've
