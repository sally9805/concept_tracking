 | Hide-and-Seek in the North Atlantic T HE GREAT , black submarine noses slowly out through the Murmansk inlet and into the swells of the Barents Sea . Standing on the conning tower , the commander watches the bleak coastline of northern Russia gradually disappear ? the last sight of land that he is likely to have for months . The hatch of the conning tower clangs shut above him now and , with a Frothing surge , the submarine slides beneath the waves and begins the long voyage to its duty station : the waters off the East Coast of the United States . The submarine is one of the Soviet Union 's new Y class of underwater craft , called by the U.S. Navy , oddly enough , the " Yankee " class . With the deployment of the Yankees , the Russians have taken an enormous stride toward equaling U.S. naval strength . The Yankee , in fact , is a remarkably good copy of the American Polaris submarine , which revolutionized naval warfare when it was introduced in the early ' 6os . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleartipped missiles . It is designed not to stalk convoys or battle fleets but to hide alone in the sea , ready to devastate targets as far inland as Chicago if ever the command should come . Although the Yankee is nearly 1 %Z times the length of a football field and weighs almost as much as a World War II cruiser , it can reach speeds of over 30 knots while submerged ? faster than most of its pursuers can go on a calm surface . To find and track a Yankee , the U.S. Navy , backed up by NATO forces , must use its most advanced techniques of anti-submarine warfare . The maneuvers between hunters and hunted are carried out with  | chilling realism by both sides . Here , for the first time , is what the chase is like . The Hunt Begins . Cruising hundreds of feet below the surface , the Yankee that set out from Murmansk is only hours into its mission but already nearing the fringes of NATO 's surveillance network . A P-3B Orion patrol plane of the Norwegian Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of its it-man crew hunch over the scopes and dials of their delicate electronic equipment , waiting , listening , searching for a telltale sign . Suddenly , there it is : a scribble of jagged lines on the recording drums . No doubt about it : another Yankee has put to sea . The information is flashed into the NATO communications network . From Iceland , which stands like a sentry barring the way to the Atlantic , a squadron of U.S. Navy Orions begins shadowing the submarine . As it moves south , sleek Nimrods of the Royal Air Force fly up from Scotland . The patrol planes can tell that the sub is a Yankee from the characteristic " signature " of the sound it transmits into the water . But the aircraft can not yet locate the Russian precisely enough to swoop in for a simulated attack . Indeed , they might not have been able to find it at all were it not for a great advantage of geography enjoyed by the NATO partners . To reach the North Atlantic from Murmansk , a Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke-120 point , " in naval terms ? between Iceland and the British Isles or , if it 's heading farther west , between Iceland and Greenland . As the Yankee moves steadily south from Murmansk , the information about its course from the Norwegians , Americans and British is fed into computers and displayed on a giant wall map in the Atlantic command headquarters for the United States and NATO in Norfolk , Va . The order goes out to an American anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) task force : locate and track that Yankee . The Trackers . The heart , brain and muscle of this task force is the aircraft carrier Intrepid , which fought the Japanese during World War II and has since been refitted for ASW . Her flight deck and her great hangar deck are crowded with helicopters and patrol planes . Escorting the Intrepid are half a dozen destroyers and , off to port , what looks like a fishing trawler . Not until you get close to the stranger can you make out the forest of antennas rising from its decks and masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrepid stalks Russian submarines .  | One of the finest ASW pilots on the Intrepid is a stocky commander named Tony Bracken , who speaks Russian and once served a tour of duty as a naval attache in Moscow . Bracken likes to match wits w Yankees . " You want to show you can stay with them , " hi " And they want to show yo can get away . " Bracken eases his Grumm , Tracker onto the port cataf the Intrepid . The stubby , pro driven aircraft is built like a to haul a fully equipped elect laboratory through the sky . I engines reach full power no ' with a great thud and who() ; catapult hurls the S-2 into t Two other S-2s follow . Bracken knows that much ingenious equipment carried S-2 to find conventional , powered submarines is inef  | against the Yankee . The nuclearpowered Yankee leaves no oil fumes to be detected by the S-2 's " sniffer , " and it cruises too deep for changes in water temperature caused by its engines to be picked up by Bracken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar sonar that finds its quarry by sending out pings of sound and then listening for the echo rebounding off a hull , the Yankee would pick up the impulse and take off in a new direction before the sonar could locate him precisely . The only way to find a Yankee is to listen for him passively . At cruising speeds his propellers create a roar as they thrash through the water . Some pumps and generators are bound to be running , and a crewman may be scraping paint or using a wrench on a piece of machinery . There is a chance that Bracken can pick up these noises , however faint they may be . " Maypole Twelve Is Hot ! " Bracken uses a device called the " sonobuoy , " a slender cylinder about three feet long . Dropped into the sea , this buoy automatically raises an antenna above the water and lowers a hydrophone ? an electronic ear ? to a preset depth . It becomes a tiny but extremely sensitive radio station that can broadcast anything it hears beneath the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " announces Bracken . The sonobuoy sparkles in the sun as it falls toward the sea . Releasing more sonobuoys , Bracken stakes out a trapline with the two =other S-2s . Three hours into the mission , Myron Mitchell , a technician in the stern of Bracken 's plane , sees a jagged pattern of yellow lines on his scope . " Maypole Twelve is hot ! " he calls . Instantly , Bracken banks toward the spot . Using their ultra-sensitive equipment , Mitchell and a second technician , Jim Higgins , separate the hodgepodge of signals into components . They are looking for distinctive elements that make up a Yankee 's " signature " ? tracings they had spent hundreds of hours studying on the carrier . Now one faint set looks unmistakable . " We 've got a Yankee ! " Mitchell announces . Fish Hawk and Trout . At an altitude of only 100 feet , the three S-2s begin moving back and forth across the sea in an elaborate minuet . One after another , more soriobuoys splash into the sea and come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub 's course , Mitchell needs data from at least three sonobuoys . He tunes in a number in succession , then charts the path . For the next half-hour , the three planes track the submarine , " holding " it on their scopes . Then a relief flight of three S-2s comes on station , and Bracken 's aircraft return to the Intrepid . All during the next day , S-2s catapult off the Intrepid to follow the Yankee as silently and intently as a fish hawk gliding over a trout in a HIDE-AND-SEEK IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC 123 stream . Then , at two o'clock the following morning , Bracken goes aloft again . His mission now is not merely to track the Yankee but to pin it down so precisely that , in theory , it could be successfully attacked . To do this , Bracken must use sonar , which will disclose his presence to the sub 's commander . Methodically , the S-2s begin dropping sonobuoys . The Yankee is still on course . The S-2s are joined by two Sea King helicopters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water on cables . Now : " We 're going active ! " announces Bracken , and releases a sonobuoy containing a miniature sonar set which sends sound waves searching through the water . Bracken can imagine the scene down below . Ping ! The first sonar impulse hits the Yankee . Coming without warning , it must have exploded in the listening gear like a bugle call . In the stern of Bracken 's S-2 , the two technicians study their instruments , waiting for the reaction . Suddenly the graphs and scopes come alive . " Damn ! " cries Mitchell . " Look at him take off ! " Like a sounding whale , the Yankee plunges downward , its speed zooming to more than 30 knots . The.S-2s place a line of sonobuoys ahead of the sub , and the helicopters hopscotch forward , pausing to dunk and listen as they go . The sky is alive with the flashing red lights of circling aircraft . The Yankee swerves , cuts circles in the water , then twists away from the S-2s and the helicopters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very far off . Then they catch and follow it again and , anticipating its moves , gradually establish its exact location . " That 's the way to do it , you guys ! " Bracken says over the intercom as he finally breaks off the pursuit . " He knows we had him good . " In a real complex situation , all the S-2 pilots would have dropped M-46 torpedoes , each one guided by its own sonar . And each could be armed with a nuclear warhead . Polaris vs . Yankee . The U.S. Navy frankly admits that it can not keep track of all the Yankees in the Atlantic . " We just do n't have enough planes and enough ships , " explains Adm . Charles Duncan , who recently retired as the supreme American and NATO commander in the Atlantic . The problem is certain to get worse as the Yankee fleet builds up from an estimated 25 submarines in 1972 to the total of 62 agreed to last May at the end of the first Strategic Arms Limitations Talks ( SALT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow from its present 41 submarines to only 44 , the Americans more than make up for their lack of numbers with greater firepower and accuracy : each Polaris missile can carry up to ten separate warheads , and each can be aimed at a different target . ( The Yankees ' missiles now have only one warhead each . ) As long as the Polaris is safe  | from detection , the two submarine fleets will balance each other ; neither side could afford to attack , knowing that the other 's submarines would survive to mount a devastating counterattack . Can the Russians track a Polaris ? " No , " says Admiral Duncan flatly . The Soviets now lag behind the United States in ASW techniques . They have two modern ships , each of which can carry 20 ASW helicopters equipped with sonobuoys and electronic gear , but as yet they have no carriers that can launch aircraft like the S-2 , which has a range far greater than any helicopter . In 1978 , after the expiration of the present SALT agreements , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Polaris . Called the Trident , the super-submarine will carry a new missile with a range of 4500 to 6000 miles . It could , in fact , hit Moo cow from Chesapeake Bay . Meanwhile , the United States and the Soviet Union press ahead with ASW . Even now , the U.S. Navy searches for submarines with elec. tronic " ears " attached to cables that snake along the ocean floor . Unmanned " platforms " move back and forth across areas of the Atlantic , listening as they go . The Navy is also erecting a huge $r-billion tower on the floor of the Atlantic itself , 16,000 feet deep , to catch the distant , menacing whisper of a submarine . But , for some years to come , ASW is likely to remain heavily dependent upon sensitive sonobuoys and skilled pilots like Tony Bracken , who will continue to fly low over the North Atlantic , trying to think two jumps ahead of a Russian commander lurking hundreds of feet beneath the white-flecked waves .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
