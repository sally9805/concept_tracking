Soul-searching in Michigan <P> To his friends and supporters , Michigan Legislator Monte R. Geralds , 43 , was a man who seemed well launched into a promising if modest political career . A decade ago , he was named Outstanding Young Man by the Junior Chamber of Commerce in his home town of Madison Heights , a Detroit suburb . Two years later he was elected mayor . The father of five and a practicing attorney , Geralds attracted attention by sponsoring a town ordinance that made parents liable to jail sentences or fines if their negligence contributed to criminal acts by their children . In 1974 Democrat Geralds parlayed his reputation for rectitude into a seat in the state house of representatives , which he won comfortably ; he was re-elected two years later . <P> This week , however , Geralds will be sentenced on a conviction of having embezzled $24,000 from a woman who was his legal client . According to the charges , he used $13,000 to buy stock and $11,000 as a down payment for an office building . He faces up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice law was lifted for three years . Since then , Geralds ' sole income has been his $24,000 annual salary as a legislator . But , unlike any other Michigan lawmaker convicted of a felony in the state legislature 's 143-year history , he has refused to resign from the house . Says Geralds , who is also appealing the guilty verdict : " I know I 'm creating an awkward , difficult situation . But I am innocent and I have a clear conscience . " <P> Michigan 's attorney general has ruled that Geralds ' crime does not constitute a " breach of the public trust , " as defined in the state 's constitution . He is therefore not liable to automatic dismissal . The ruling means that Geralds ' fellow legislators must take personal responsibility for his expulsion by a two-thirds majority of the 109-member house . It is a task that they-or at least his 67 fellow Democrats-approach with great reluctance . Says House Speaker Bobby Crim : " There is definitely sympathy for a man who has a family and where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Geralds ' case has prompted soul-searching on the part of legislators , who have suddenly discovered that they are a very fallible lot . Another legislator , also a Democrat , has admitted to receiving $5,000 from a dog-racing promoter in early 1977 , eleven weeks before introducing a bill to legalize that sport . He has been asked to resign , but has not done so . <P> After three days in which nothing else was discussed in the house , the lawmakers voted to put Geralds ' case before a policy committee . That committee , which began hearings last week , has 30 days in which to draft an expulsion resolution for the full assembly . When polled informally , 73 members-the required two-thirds-say they would expel Geralds immediately . One factor in the minds of many is that this is an election year . Legislators fear that a failure to expel Geralds will rebound unfavorably against them at the polls . Says the house majority floor leader Joseph Forbes , " Fifteen or 16 swing seats are at stake . " <P> And what will Geralds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided , " says he . " to run again . " If he wins , Geralds will be home free . Michigan 's constitution specifies that a house member can not be expelled twice for the same offense. ?
