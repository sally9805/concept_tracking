A wealthy French importer named Bernard Fischler and his wife used to travel abroad with their little girl . Occasionally they wanted to take short side trips by themselves , but they could never find a satisfactory place to leave their daughter . " That , " says Fischler , " is when I started dreaming of a beautiful hotel just for children . " <P> This month his dream materialized in the village of La Trtoire in the heart of the Brie cheese country 55 miles east of Paris . There , on seven acres of woods and meadows , Bernard Fischler opened a 62-room hotel , called Mon Club , designed exclusively for 220 children from ages three to 16 . Adult guests are strictly off limits . <P> Foursomes . The hotel was aptly described by one visitor as un maxi-palace pour mini-clients . A four-story white building with a chocolate-tiled roof , Mon Club has one regulation and four practice tennis courts , a stable with eight horses , a gym , a soccer field and two heated swimming pools . For indoor fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discotheque . Next year the hotel will have a skating rink , a golf course and a small zoo . Knowing that all play and no work makes Jacques un enfant terrible , Fischler also included a library , a photo lab and four crafts workshops in his blueprints . At an additional cost the hotel also provides lessons in four languages and other tutoring . <P> For about $15.50 a day-roughly half the cost of a first-rate French resort hotel-a regular paying guest is provided with bed and board and the use of all facilities . On hand are a doctor , a nurse , nine supervisors and 13 athletic instructors , besides the usual desk clerks , waiters and maids . The hotel is divided into three sections , one for toddlers , another for girls , and one for boys . Most rooms accommodate threesomes or foursomes , but singles are also available . Every room has original watercolors , a bathroom with fixtures sized according to age group , and carpeting that is not merely wall-to-wall but three feet up the wall . For safety 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of stairs , and in the smaller-children 's area , windows placed too high for adventurous climbing . <P> Unlike an American summer camp , Mon Club has no reveille or rigid schedule . Guests may rise any time between 7:30 and 9 and go to one of the two dining rooms ( one for little children and one for big ) to choose their breakfasts and have all the orange juice they can drink . After that there are only two compulsory activities : morning calisthenics and participating in one sport . The latter may include swimming , horseback riding , bicycling , fishing or kayaking in the nearby Petit Morin River , as well as more strenuous games such as soccer and tennis .
