White House advisers are referring to this week 's seven-nation conference in London as the " Downing Street summit . " The phrase has a reassuring ring , evoking images of leather upholstery , briar pipes , glasses of sherry , and urbane diplomats about to decide the fate of the world without undue interference from press or public . Those days are long gone , of course , but Jimmy Carter is taking a kind of subdued , 19th century approach to his two-day meeting with the leaders of Britain , France , West Germany , Italy , Japan and Canada . He plans to listen and learn , and not press too hard for U.S. policies . No one expects great decisions to be made . At best the negotiators may agree to cooperate on such problems as economic stagnation , nuclear proliferation , East-West relations and Middle East tensions . <P> One of the most interesting items not on the agenda is Carter himself , making his first trip abroad as President . Foreign leaders are curious about him . To them , he remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has assumed control of U.S. foreign policy but wonder if he knows how to manage it . West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , in particular , distrusts what he considers an evangelistic style and inexperience . " He is making policy from the pulpit , " scoffs Schmidt privately . In an effort to strike up a badly needed rapport , the President and the Chancellor will have a private talk during the sessions . <P> During the conference , Carter hopes to show that he is both practical and flexible , and that his statecraft must be taken seriously . Says a top presidential adviser : " The President is acutely conscious that there are plenty of uncertainties and even worries about him in Europe . I think he will impress them as a pragmatist , not a moralist , and as a guy who 's got a firm grip on the problems . " Fuel Sales . Carter arrives bolstered by firm public support at home . A New York Times/CBS News survey last week showed that he had a 64% favorable rating after announcing his energy program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallup poll earlier in April , but not the 15 points he had feared . <P> In Europe , officials , who had long urged the U.S. to cut back its prodigal use of fuel , were much relieved . Le Monde estimated that by increasing coal production and reducing consumption , the U.S. could realize 55% of the possible energy savings for the entire industrialized world . Concluded the Paris newspaper : " These nations can therefore say , ' At last ! ' " A senior aide to British Energy Secretary Anthony Wedgwood Benn commented , " It 's an act of considerable courage for the leader of the largest energy user in the world to set out policies for conservation on such a scale .
