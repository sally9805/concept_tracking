Richard Wagner was determined to make a name for himself in Paris . So when the Paris Opra rejected his latest work , Tristan und Isolde , Wagner dusted off his Tannhuser , which had been produced in Dresden 16 years earlier , and Frenchified it . He wrote new music for a ballet in the first scene and reworked the character and music of the love goddess Venus in his best chromatic , post-Tristan style . <P> For nearly a century the Paris Tannhuser remained the most frequently performed version of the opera . Audiences loved the voluptuous new bacchanale ; sopranos preferred to sing the more dramatic music of Venus . But eventually purists objected to the musical schizophrenia in the work , and came to prefer the earlier Dresden Tannhuser . All the recordings , too , used the Dresden score until last week , when London released the first LPs of the Paris version-a premiere of sorts . <P> The recording is a knockout , fully comparable to London 's history-making Ring cycle . Conductor Georg Solti , today 's top conductor of Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus , Mezzo-Soprano Christa Ludwig seethes with eroticism , suggesting a world of impossible sexuality . Soprano Helga Dernesch as Elisabeth , Wagner 's virginal opposite to Venus , is the perfect embodiment of pinched Victorian purity . Best of all is Tenor Ren Kollo , a German pop singer metamorphosed into a Heldentenor , who sings Tannhuser with a gleaming tone , power , and a dramatic force unequaled since Lauritz Melchior . <P> ?
