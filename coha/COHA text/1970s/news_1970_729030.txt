txt A novel by E. M. Forster , withheld at his request for 55 years because of its homosexual theme , is now to be published . The manuscript was found among Forster 's papers after his death last June at the age of 91 . Across the top he had written : " Publishable  --  but is it worth it ? " The novel , entitled " Mau-. rice , " was written between 1913 and 1915 . Forster told his London publisher , Edward Arnold , about it years ago but said he did not want it to appear during his lifetime . The publisher now hopes to bring it out by next fall . The exact date will depend on completion of legal formalities under the will , and preparation of the manuscript by Forster 's literary executor , Prof. W. J. H. Sprott , of Nottingham University , and authorized biographer , P. N. Furbank . Although universally regarded as a major figure in English fiction of this century , Forster wrote only five novels , The publication of a new one will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passage to India , " in 1924 . Forster published numerous essays after that date , but his decades of silence as a novelist helped to make him a man of fascination and mystery in literary history . The publication of " Maurice " will also throw more light on Forster 's own homosexuality , and on changing British attitudes toward homosexuality in this century , Forster 's writing was so restrained and his public personality so reticent that many admirers probably never wondered about his sexuality . But since his death the question has been candidly discussed in Britain . Lord Annan , intellectual historian and provost of University College , London , said last July in a British Broad // casting Corporation radio program : " Of course Forster was a homosexual , there 's no question about this . He would n't want to have denied it . " Over his 90 years , Lord Annan remarked , Forster had " seen public opinion change very gradually from the hysterical outburst of the trial of Oscar Wilde in 1895 to the recent repeal of laws against adult homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpublished novel , said on the B.B.C. that the book was about the relations of the title character " with a man in Cambridge , which were not particularly successful , and then with a workingclass man . " " He was particularly anxious that at all costs the book should have a happy ending , " Professor Sprott said of Forster , " because people have so often said that homosexual relations never have a happy ending . " The plans to . publish " Maurice " became known in connection with the annoucement of Forster 's will . He left an estate of $151,000 after taxes . The bulk of that will be held in trust for Professor Sprott during his lifetime and then go to King 's College , Cambridge . Forster , who was unmarried , was an honorary fellow of King 's and lived there for many years before ? his death . Professor Sprott said today that Forster had not wanted to suppress " Maurice " permanently but had only wanted to avoid intrusive controversy while alive . He was intensely dedicated to privacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published during his lifetime , " Professor Sprott said , " there would be a great fuss . He was too bored with that sort of thing . " Mr. Furbank , who is to do an authorized biography , considered Forster 's homosexuality among other aspects of his personality in an article in the current issue of Encounter . " He achieved physical sex very late , " Mr. Furbank wrote , " and found it easier with people outside his own social class ; and it remained a kind of private magic for him ? an almost unattainable blessing , for which another person was mainly a pretext . " " He was always infinitely attentive and thoughtful " towards a lover , Mr. Furbank continued , " but he never showed any wish to set up house with him . " Of course he knew many homosexual menages and found them perfectly congenial , but it never crossed his mind to be part of one . But then it would be quite wrong to put this down just to temperament . " He quite seriously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fretted at having to write ' marriage-fiction . ' He suspected marriage might produce more harm than good ; he was sure , at least , that there were finer possibilities outside it . " To many readers of Forster , all this will come as a surprise . His sensitively drawn women are widely regarded as his outstanding fictional creations and the sorrow and the joy of marriage are portrayed with convincing emotion . In addition to " Maurice , " a number of unpublished essays and stories are among his papers . There is also an unfinished novel , " Arctic Summer , " on which he worked between 1912 and 1914 . Whether and when these will be published will be decided by the executors as they read through the papers . Portrait Was Removed A portrait of Forster done in 1911 by Roger Fry was described by Evert Barger , writing in The New York Times Book Review last Aug. 16 . The portrait , he wrote , had reposed over the fireplace in the Forster ? home for more than a decade , until one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remarked , " Dear me , your son is n't queer , is he ? " " And so the portrait was removed overnight and came into our hands , ' Mr. Barger recalled .
