A MONTH OF SUNDAYS <P> by JOHN UPDIKE 228 pages . Knopf. $6.95 . <P> <P> After years of dutifully ministering to his flock , the Rev. Thomas Marshfield , 41 , begins fleecing the ewes . When his trysts with the church organist and other assorted supplicants are exposed , Marshfield is shipped West for a month 's rest to a desert spa for troubled clergymen . The regimen is ecumenical . There is golf in the afternoon , poker at night and daiquiris whenever . Mornings are spent alone at an obligatory typewriter , where orgies of therapeutic confession are the order of the day . <P> As his 31-day story reveals , Marshfield is a stock character from Updike 's central casting . He snorts at liberal Protestantism and pumps for devotion inspired by awe and terror ( " Mop up spilt religion ! Let us have it in its original stony jars or not at all ! " ) . At the same time he pushes graphic , adulterous sex as suburbia 's best anodyne ; coupling is sweetest with the ashen taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavenly sweepstakes , where all the runners are male . <P> To perk up this familiar rehash , Updike gives his clergyman a bag of Nabokovian wordplays and tries to pass him off as Humbert Humbert ( in Lolita , Humbert observed , " You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style " ) . Marshfield rattles off alliterations as if he were on death row . He describes a local nursery " which piously kept its Puerto Rican peony-pluckers in a state of purposeful peonage . " With nary a blush he writes of returning home to the " fusty forgiveness of my fanlighted foyer . " His frequent dissections of sex and theology revolve around a central question : How many matrons can dance on the head of a pun ? " More power to the peephole ! " the Rev. Marshfield exults after describing a session of spying on his curate and his mistress of the moment . <P> Before long , Marshfield 's worst problem seems to be a case of terminal cuteness . Unlike Humbert , he is not facing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch , free to resume his pallid philandering as soon as he leaves . <P> Updike is too talented to write un distinguished fiction , and A Month of Sundays contains more than its share of finely wrought apercus : " In the end , fashion overcomes personality : all the mistresses of Louis XV look alike . " <P> Marshfield 's sermons ( he writes one each Sunday of his stay ) are slypastich es of biblical scholarship and sophistry . <P> Few writers can be as entertainingly cerebral as Updike . Yet after nearly two decades of distinguished service as the thinking man 's John O'Hara , Updike seems to have reported everything he knows about the sexually tormented middle class . The ground covered in A Month of Sundays is fast becoming scorched earth . <P> Paul Gray
