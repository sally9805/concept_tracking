txt Hurricane Belle shows the strength and weakness of modern hurricane forecasting . Satellite photos and radar echoes have kept detailed track of its progress . There was no possibility of the storm taking anyone by . surprise . But pinpoint forecasting of where the storm would go next was impossible . Its course was so close to , and parallel with , the Eastern United States coast that it remained within the margin of uncertainty of hurricane forecasting . That 's why forecasters at the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) took the unusual step Monday morning of designating a 460-mile long warning zone from Cape Lookout , North Carolina , to the Merrimack River of Massachusetts . They knew that , at any moment , the storm might suddenly veer inland to cross the coast before they could issue a further ? warning . So they made sure all potentially threatened people had ample time to prepare . NHC director Neil Frank says that hurricane forecasting ability is on a plateau . Over a 24-hour forecasting period , there 's an average latitude-longitude error of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicting landfall for a hurricane clearly headed for a coast . When the storm runs parallel to a coastline and close in , as Belle has done , that uncertainty is greatly increased . Even so , this forecasting accuracy is an improvement over the almost blind guessing that characterized hurricane prediction several decades ago . The trouble , Mr. Frank explains , is that coastal populations in the East have grown so much that their density cancels out the forecasting gain . So a 200-mile or so uncertainty today affects as many or more people than the larger uncertainties of yesterday . However , unless and until computer forecasting of hurricanes improves substantially , forecasting skill will likely remain at this level . Meanwhile , the forecaster 's best friend is the big eye in the sky ? the weather satellite that both gives early warning of hurricane formation and helps keep detailed track of a mature storm . // * Hurricane forecasts better // The " geostationary " satellite , in a roughly 22,300-mile-high orbit where it remains more or less over one spot on the equator , keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . It " sees " on the order of 100 seedling storms that form there every year . You never hear about most of them . But as soon as one begins to take on the tightly organized circular wind structure of a developing hurricane , weather observers know it . Essential to climate system These storms are a natural part of the atmospheric system for distributing moisture , heat , and wind- energy around the earth . Tropical regions absorb most of the energy coming from the sun . This must be redistributed to maintain a livable climate . This is why meteorologists would approach any attempt at hurricane modification with caution . Hurricanes , feeding off warm surface waters of the sea , pick up large quantities of heat as water evaporates into the storm system . When this water vapor condenses again , it not only releases moisture , it gives up the heat that evaporated it . Although meteorologists still understand the role of hurricanes imperfectly , they do know enough to pick up signs of the birth of a storm and to anticipate its development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective early warning system .
