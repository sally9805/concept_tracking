txt You thought the election was over ? Nonsense , it 's lust begun-1972. that is . The drama will be in three acts . Act 1 is the sparring between a Republican President and a Democratic Congress , strengthened by Democratic gains in various state governments around the country . The first big battles will be economic : farm aid , welfare aid , and corporate aid in the form of quotas . Act 2 will be the obstacle race through the primaries of various Democratic presidential aspirants next year who want to challenge President Nixon . They are lining up already : Sen. Edmund S. Muskie is front runner ; Sen. George McGovern may be the first man with his bat in the ring . Act 3 will begin with the party conventions in 1972 , and will run to election day ; the issue : Mr. Nixon 's administration . Most voters want a rest from politics , but the business of government ca n't stop and , in an adversary system , that means politics . Almost before a fast eye could wink after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler asserted that " we consider this a tremendous success "  --  and Democratic Majority Leader Mike Mansfield denied that the President had established " a working majority . " Many observers , trying to look two years ahead , believe Mr. Nixon will run in 1972 on " peace and prosperity . " He will continue taking troops out of Vietnam and try to preserve the delicate balance with the Soviet Union ; he will at the same time try to improve the economy at home . Congress will be back Nov. 16 ; almost at once the economic clash starts . The economy was the Republicans ' heaviest burden in the midterm election . If Mr. Nixon ever mentioned the word " unemployment , " few political writers can remember it . // *Election over ? Nonsense ! // Yet there is the present situation : Inflation is running at the rate of 4.8 percent a year . Unemployment , that stood around 3.5 percent when Mr. Nixon took office , is at 5.6 percent , highest in almost seven years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A production gap has opened up , between what the United States is turning out and what it could turn out , of about $40 billion . Fortunatily for the nation there are some signs of improvement , though these are often negative- ; things are getting worse slower . Inflation slowing Most economists agree that inflation is slowing down ; it was 6.3 percent in the first quarter ; 5.8 percent in the second ; and 4.2 percent in the third . Unemployment in September rose only 1/10th of 1 percent in spite of the General Motors strike . The trouble is that to bring " prosperity " by 1972 , Mr. Nixon must move faster than that ; indeed , to set the stage for a successful presidential campaign an extraordinary rate of recovery seems necessary . The most authoritative estimate of this comes from Mr. Nixon 's own Council of Economic Advisers . It is based on gross national product ( GNP )  --  the sum total of all goods and services produced by the nation . How to boost GNP To get unemployment down to a moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real growth rate of GNP ( presently around zero ) must be boosted extraordinarily , so as to give an average 6 percent from now to August , 1972 . " Real " growth means without inflation . If there is 3 percent inflation the unadjusted growth rate would be 9 percent . Can Mr. Nixon do it ? During the midterm campaign Democrats denounced the administration economic-game plan as being too slow . The White House retorted , with some justice , that the slide was started by the Democrats . But in the next two years the circumstances will change ; if there is still a stagnant economy it will be Mr. Nixon 's responsibility . If the crime rate does n't go down , Democrats will argue it is the President 's fault . Some here think there will be two changes on the economic-policy front by President Nixon : 1 . He will adopt a more expansionary economic policy . 2 . He will adopt some kind of an " incomes policy " ( using White House moral pressure , guidelines , or wage and price controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
