txt The big drive to reform campaign funding in the United States failed here in the Senate , but sponsors say it is lust a curtain raiser . Under White House pressure me amendment to establish public campaign financing was dropped from the - debt ceiling bill , and the latter went to the White House and was signed . The intense six-day battle indicates the pressure for campaign reform building up in Congress and apparently reflecting strong public feelings engendered by Watergate . The former temporary debt ceiling of $465 billion , which reverted to $400 billion Friday night when Congress failed to extend it , is now raised to $475.7 billion . It is still " temporary " ? ready for a new battle and perhaps new , nongermane amendments when it , in turn , expires next June 30 . Passage of the act means that the nation will not technically go " bankrupt , " in the sense that it can not legally pay current debts from available funds . The immediate result was a victory for President Nixon , whose spokesmen vigorously lobbied against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate filibuster led by . James B. Allen ( D ) of Alabama , whose supporters twice blocked cloture , requiring a two-thirds majority . The vote for cloture was 48 to 36 , or 10 votes short . Significantly , both Senate party leaders favored campaign reform ? Mike Mansfield ( D ) of Montana , and Hugh Scott ( R ) of Pennsylvania . Mr. Scott has recently taken a more independent line from- the White House and has criticized its handling of Watergate . Advocates of campaign-spending reform seem encouraged by the results of the " six-day war . " In the House they have the promise by Rep. // * Campaign reform still alive // Wayne L. Hays ( D ) of Ohio , chairman of the Administration Committee , of prompt action on a new bill in February . In the Senate Messrs .

In presidential primaries each candidate would get matching of public funds for each $100 donated by a private giver . ? To be eligible , candidates would have to raise $100,000 in contributions of no more than $100 each . ? Candidates in primaries would be limited to total-matching payments amounting to 5 cents per eligible voter , or around $7 million ; the ceiling on expenditures in the primary campaign for the nomination would be $15 millions . ? Overall , major party candidates in the general ( postprimary ) elections could not spend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . ? Private contributions from any single source would be limited to $3,000 , whether in primaries or general elections .
