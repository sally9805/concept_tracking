, the landscape , Devon , the wildlife , his childhood  --  as if all that was why it meant so much to him , I sensed something else . What he really needed was not the place , but an excuse to talk about it . Ile hardly ever lives there , it 's really just a hobby , something he 's acquired on the way to what he actually is . Which of course he knows  --  or rather , since he 's as scared of not seeming to see his own paradoxes as a good chess-player of exposing his queen , he thinks he knows . He said it once , when we were talking about Citizen Kane ( he may alter this if I 've got it wrong ) : how the great master-stroke was the Rosebud symbolism , how the worst corruption of the corrupt practitioners of a corrupt art was the notion that you could buy back innocence . Like a Mafia contribution to the local priest  --  as if that would save you if there really were a Heaven and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see why being objective about his pseudo-farm let him out , either . But I did n't dislike him for it . He never realized he was n't ugly when he was fallible . And his father being a vicar ( I had n't then realized The Empty Church was autobiographical ) . I laughed , I just could n't believe it . I did n't really believe it till the day we were out driving down to Marineland and got into a freeway crawl , and he started singing hymns . Guying them , all their Christian nonsense . But he 'd rememberedso many . That was another moment I loved him . He was fun to be with sometimes . So the self-contained thing was really just a symptom of his inability to relate to anything but a place where he did n't have to relate , except verbally , and after a few Dettols . I never got far beyond even that secret . To his real ones , like Caroline . I hated the way he used to talk ( before I had it out with hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were some useless secretary he was stuck with at home , instead of his own daughter . All right , so her mother 's screwed her up and given her values he despises . But it was transparent that in fact he was just hurt , resentful ... and not only about the past , having lost her , but also about having got hooked on me , the incest bit ( but what did he think he sometimes was for me ? ) , and hating it and loving it . Then all the murk behind his broken marriage . I gave up trying to penetrate that . And his other women , his quite grotesque evasivenessabout that , if I got nosey . As if I might be offended , as if that kind of past ever made a man less attractive . I should n't call him a smart leather suitcase . He 's really an old split parcel , done up with fifty thousand clumsy knots . He outrages all my Scottishness . All this was summed up on that weird last evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan , I did feel something was going to happen to us ) . When you , I mean he , talked of chasms . And I told him he meant barricades . I hope he 'll think very hard about that , if he ever reads this . I 'm running and running him down , but all this actually made us more equal . I never realized so clearly before that old ' minds are also young minds in old bodies . ( Unkind , I mean nice no-longeryoungbodies . ) There were increasingly times when I felt older . I was older . When that extraordinary call came , he was like a child , a small child , a small boy who is frightened and excited and trying to hide both by being mature ' . Somebody truly , actually , for God 's sake really wanted him . He felt set free , I could feel it . I was very angry , which I hid . Not that he decided to go , but had the nerve to drag me in as a pretext . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about using him . At least I 've been open about it . I look back now and I see that its all happening , something like it , was inevitable . After Tini and I broke up and I ran wild , it was kind of in the air . It had to be someone like Dan , in the end . This was an element I brought in from the first ( though it was n't calculated , I 'm really saying he 's also taught me to be more honest ) . It had had to happen , it had a kind of dialectical inevitability , therefore it must one day change to something else . That therefore ' was always around . Made it a stage , in both senses . It was Harold , in the Birmingham days , who gave me the clue . He said : All good actresses are whores . Because on top of the normalneed to experience , we have a professional duty to experience . I was conscious of that long before Dan . I was very conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of it , our fighting and screaming , a secret little Jenny-doll sat in my brain licking cream . That first screen part was full of the cream she 'd been licking , if I 'm frank . Dan came to the airport to meet me at Los Angeles . With the studio publicity woman and her photographer and roses in cello-40 41phane . He claimed it was because Bill could n't make it , he was just standing in . Which spoilt it . A little . But he was n't drunk , he was dry and rather paternal , a different person from Claridges . And when we were at last in the limo away into the land of the fries and the burgers he described his own first arrival years before , unmet . The feeling totally alien and lost . He saw me look at one of the monopod hoardings , with some absurd giantess of a drummajoretteslowly spiralling on top . He said , You have to decide one thing here  --  which is real , you or Los Angeles . Right ? I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the nicest , the best thing he ever gave me . Los Angeles ' means anywhere . I was in flakes and they made me go straight to bed when we got to the hotel . I was to have a free day before the publicity grind and fittings and the rest . There was a list of flats , apartments , to look at . I 'd decided that somehow living in an apartment would mean like being in digs in rep . A tin of coffee , a box of detergent , a kettle to boil . I might need that . The publicity woman had planned to take me looking , but Dan offered to combine it with a drive round the sights . I think he saw something in my face , she was n't my cup of tea at all . Frightened me with all that career-woman processedcheesecakecharm . He picked me up at ten next morning . I had n't been able to sleep well , I kept on getting up and staring out of the window . So this is America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Ninetenthsof me was still in London , dear little Belsize Park . I was scared , I was glad Dan was going to be there to shepherd me in the morning . He was in the Polo Lounge , drinking coffee and reading the day before 's London Times . Very reassuring . And I even felt excited for a while , just a tourist . But it got too much , we saw too many places too far apart and I began to get in a panic again , going all instinctive instead of practical . He was patient and neutral . Like an estate agent , bored but hiding it , with a rich client . And then I began to think he was secretly watching me , trying to make up his mind whether I really was right for the part and I felt annoyed that he was n't sure . He said later he liked what he called my being choosy . He 'd just been curious , anthropological ' . I did n't think of him in a bed way at all . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bothstanding in . And dismissed him at once . He tried to put me off the place I fmally said yes to . But I fell for the view . I 'd realized by then that I 'd never find room-shapes and furniture I could happily live with . So I hired the view . We had a late lunch back at the hotel . He offered to drive me round some more , but by then I wanted to get rid of him . I went and slept . That same day 's evening Bill had flown back from New York and he and his wife and Dan took Inc out to dinner . It was for me to meet Steve as well , but he had n't turned up , though he 'd been supposed to make the same flight as Bill . Who brought profuse apologies . Steve was busy laying , of course ( as he told me as soon as we did meet , the next afternoon ) . It was like the birds-of-paradise with the note from him ( Thrilled to be working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the florist 's shop . From the hotel , and Bill , and the man Gold , and the studio  --  none from Dan , though  --  in my suite when I arrived . Each card written in the same hand . When I thanked Steve for flowers and message , he just opened his hands , a typically lousy piece of acting . He did n't know what the hell I was talking about . But I 'd already heard enough about him by then . At dinner that first evening Bill and Dan had fmally drunk enough to be bitchy and more honest . I learnt for the first time that Steve was neither of them 's first choice  --  the man Gold had pulled box-office . Steve has some hang-ups , said Bill . He 's a prick , said Dan . I can handle it , said Bill . It is there . And then Dan smiled at me , the faintest wink , partly at that clumsy use of it ' , but something nicer . Both tender and wry , some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alliance . And it said he 'd decided to like me , we 'd find a way to cope with the Prick . Which we did n't , but never mind . Then next days : meeting the Prick , fighting wardrobe , the awful run-throughs , re-writes , arguments . Trying to get it to the P. that I did n't want to make it quite yet in the sack , thanks very much all the same . One god-awful statutory evening alone with him and his hang-ups  --  well , what Dan would call anthropologically quite interesting , they all seemed so calculated , part of his image , and ludicrouslydolled up with Nam and all the okay political attitudes . I got42 I 43very prim and English with all his sloppy cliches . He 'd have done fine as a beach bum or a gigolo . It was trying to be a thinking actor . And irresistible penis . I let him kiss me at the end . Killed the groping before it got anywhere , and any repetition of it . All this was against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a movie in Hollywood for gosh sake , maybe we should start an industry here . Ha ha . Of course I knew my real career ( thou dark enigma ) did n't depend on this very much , if at all  --  Dan did n't have to teach me that . But I had some sort of culture shock . I could n't tell the P. what I really thought of him , as I would have back home . He had to be made to want to help me a little , with all the sex scenes ahead . And then the awful synthetic gloss ( I had n't met Abe and Mildred then , remember ) over the other people in this world , the constant gescheffting , gossiping , organizing , like hundreds of little plastic cogs in a clock that wo n't keep real time anyway . Nothing ever seemed to stop , one always had to be doing something , planning something , saying something that was meaningful ' . It was like a foreign language I could n't speak ( not AmericanEnglish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to because I could understand it . All those boring evenings with people I never wanted to see again . Worse even than boring publicity . Feeling I was being dragged down into the gloss and the plastic and the piddling self-importance , all of which made me long for England and people who do their own thing naturally and not because it 's a trendy little phrase . Long for hours that drift and conversation that hops about and has silences , with nobody really believing one another or expecting to be believed , because it 's all a game . All you pointed out to me later about old and recent users of a language . The awful give-away of trying to be meaningful ' . Sorry . All Dan pointed out to me . Which made me look forward  --  more to that than to Dan  --  to an evening with him . His suggestion , very tentative , an English exiles ' evening , just the two of us . I had lost touch with him a little after that first day . He was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionally . The P. was always coming up with better ' ( shorter ) lines , or no lines at all because he could get it across by some piece of fantastically subtle sub-sub-Brando ( Jesus ) shtik which he could never quite demonstrate , let alone explain . Bill and44Dan must have agreed how to handle it . Bill would sound sympatheticand interested , Dan would finally shoot him down . I think they were right , it was the only way . But it was so long-winded . And the P. started taking against Dan and the whole script and tried to enlist my support . I used to sit there silent in all the gas and think how much simpler the whole bloody process was at home . So our evening . We drove back over the hills to the San Fernando Valley and some dotty Russian place , where the food came in dribs and drabs , with endless pauses , and not what we 'd thought we 'd ordered anyway , but delicious . I pumped him discreetly , his past . Learnt he was divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trespassers keep out . I did . But his career , his plays , why he 'd stopped writing them , movies , America ... he talked a lot and I responded and he listened when I began unloading all niy own naive feelings about California . I knew we had a wavelength , something I 'd doubted before . He came in for a night-cap when we got back to my apartment . Ten minutes later he pecked my cheek and left . I wanted him to . Which does n't mean that it was n't a lovely evening and a great relief . Shooting began , locations , and I hardly saw him then . Just very occasionally he would appear , he 'd already started on the Kitchener script . But then he was there one day during the sequences at Malibu and we had a talk between takes . I was getting pissed off , they seemed to need so long to set things up and Bill never seemed satisfied until we 'd done three takes more than necessary . I used to get driven straight home after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven , ten sometimes . A model young actress . But compared to dressing up and going out and being a sex-object and wildly bored ... I started turning down everything . I had a courtesy meal with Bill and his wife , but I think that was all for a whole week . It was strange , I rather enjoyed it . Cooking the bits I 'd scribble Martha to buy when she came in to clean . Or sometimes I 'd stop off in the studio car and pop into a health-food place or a delicatessen . Kitchen around a bit , watch the inane TV . Read . Write home like a schoolgirl . It was Dan 's fault . I was trying too hard to prove California was unreal , not me . Some of which ( not that last bit ) I found myself telling Dan between takes at Malibu . We were paddling , like elderly trippers at45Southend . The stills man took a photo of us I 've kept . Both staring at the sea at our feet . I suppose I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien culture . And honestly no , I did n't feel lonely at all . Yes , of course I 'd ring if ... and suddenly knowing I was lonely . That was where the digs illusion broke down . The other girl I 'd have had to chatter with and moan to . It was a kind of bottling up , that was why I was writing so many letters . It was just someone to talk to , no more than that . I 'd stopped the jack-and fill , I was getting on perfectly well as a temporary nun . I said , I 've discovered a sensational health-food store . He gave me a side-look . Is that an invitation , Jenny ? It had n't really been . Then suddenly was . Tonight ? If I promise to leave by ten ? I knew I had to come to a decision , as soon as I 'd said yes . It had all been very guarded , casual , space for withdrawal on both sides . But I knew check ' would be attempted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole aspect of Dan I have n't mentioned before  --  the fact that he has a name . On the other hand , knowing that by the highest standards he never quite got there , that his plays are really rather square , that among my generation in the theatre there are a dozen other writers we are more interested in , more with ' ... which he knows , though it 's always been a taboo subject between us . He assumes I despise him theatrically , at best a sort of toleration . And perhaps I always assumed too much that he did n't really care . Then something else : the fact that , in ( silly ) terms of having your name in the papers , I 've always before gone down rather than up for my men . I 'd known for some time that that was n't healthy . As if it was n't enough to give my delightful body-and-soul to them , but there had to be the press cuttings as well . It was partly vanity . Handing out the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despising them for not having made it  --  which is exactly how Timothy once put it . And outraged me , I was so sure my living with him proved I was a democrat , that I saw through all the ballyhoo , I might be an embryo star but my feet were on the ground . It was also a fear , almost a little girl 's fear that I should one day wake up and all this would burst like a bubble , so better not risk too much . But the other thing was paramount . I always felt safer when there was something inA6lovers I could despise . I could n't even call it political , a justifiable Women 's Lib attitude . It went much deeper , to a nasty little selfcentredterror of being challenged and disturbed . Reduced to equality . I 'd thought often about all this since I came to California . It may shock Dan , but it did play quite a part . He was n't very famous , or someone I admired deeply as a writer . Just quite famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little and still feel he was a long step up from nonentity . He was perhaps going down and I was perhaps coming up , but for now the balance of success and experience and professional respect and everything else was heavily on his side . Except physically , I 'd be doing him no favours . This all sounds so vilely calculated . I kept changing my mind about him ( or it ) through the rest of that day at work . And there were honestly all kinds of simpler things . Wanting to know him better , thinking how it would put the Prick 's nose out , feeling excited , both emotionally and sexually . I suppose I saw Dan as a sort of challenge . I remember having had a shower and staring at myself naked in the mirror , before he came . Feeling strange . Just not knowing . I 've always known before . Then wanting , much later that evening , after eleven , him to make a move . He 'd been pumping me , much better than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cats are right , you do need regular confession . Like menstruation . He 'd coaxed out of me what I really felt about the film , about Bill , about the Prick ( we agreed for that name for Steve that evening ) . Everything . My never being quite sure what Bill wanted or what dotty new improvisationsthe P. would suddenly introduce into a scene , and why Bill let him get away with it so often . Dan was nice : the rushes I 'm not allowed to see , I was doing fine . Even the ever-pessimistic Gold was impressed . But what I liked best was knowing Dan himself had passed me . Then the talk finally wearing thin , as if I was hinting that he should go , but it was only because I did n't know how to say that he did n't have to . A fantastic silence . It seemed to last for ever . He was lying on the couch , feet up , staring at the ceiling . I was sitting on the rug beside47the log-place , hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the wall , staring at my toes . I was wearing a shirt , no bra , a long skirt . No make-up . He 'd come in a blazer , foulard , studious informal like a smart Angeleno . Only he 'd taken the blazer off . A blue flowered shirt . He said , If this was a script , I 'd have the man get up and go . Or the girl get up and come . We 're wasting footage . He turned his head on the couch and looked across at me . I did n't like that corny way he 'd put it . He was n't smiling and I did n't smile back . After a moment I stared down at my feet again . He got up , picked his blazer off a chair and just exited . Without a word . Not even a goodnight or a thank you for the meal . The door closed and I was left sitting there . Perverse : he 'd have to do better than that and I still did n't want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside door open and then it was slammed shut . Silence . I ran to ... I do n't know , at least say something . And he was there , leaning by the front door , inside , staring down at the ground . The old trick . I turned back into the room and he came after me , switching off the lights . I remember he put his arms round my back and kissed the back of my head . I said , Dan , I 'm not on the pill at the moment . That 's all . No problem . If that really is all . I put my hands down on his and said , I did n't want you to go . He began to unbutton my shirt , undressed me , without kissing me again after that first touch . Then himself , and I was still half perverse , I just stood there waiting , looking out at the lights all the long way to the ocean , hearing the freeway traffic down below : all those funny , streaky , wobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , a new man , where is this room , who am I , who cares , why . Hc came and put his arms round my shoulders and led me to the couch . We lay down side by side and he ran his hand down my body , watching me . Almost as if he thought I might flinch . As if I 'd never had sex before . He said , I 've been wanting to ring you all week . I said , I wish you had. 48We kissed then . I was simple , passive , no games , I let him do what he wanted , responded just enough to show him I wanted him to do what he wanted  --  there was still something uncertain , I was n't sure I wanted him for this , though I did n't mind . Anyway , it never is natural the first time , one 's taking notes , comparing , remembering , waiting . In the end we went on the floor and I thought of tomorrow . ti , . eing him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are to I . ' ve it so simple . He did n't say anything . Neither of us said anything for some time . We just lay there , the way you come out of a film sometimes and you do n't want to talk about it . I thought how little I knew about him . Wondered how much he did this sort of thing . There was very little unit gossip about him . Wondered what he really thought about nne . His age , his past , my age , my past . He broke the silence . First Ile reached out and traced the line of my mouth . Jenny , in the argot of this barbarous province what I 've just done is lay a broad . The only way to kill that argot is to break the rules of the ritual that accompanies it . By the rules I should thank you for a dice fuck , dress and drive home . But I 'm going to take you to bed j and sleep , just sleep , beside you . Kiss you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . You understand , if tomorrow you feel it 's all a mistake , fine . I just want to be sure that for now ' y e behave like European humans . Not movieland apes . He was leaning on his elbow , watching me in the darkness . I said , It already is tomorrow . I 'm still here. 1Ie kissed my hand . Okay , then just one more speech . I 've been in love often enough i i niy life to know the symptoms . As opposed to the lay-the-broad tines . But love is a sickness of my generation . Not yours . I do n't expect you at any point to catch it from me . Is that a request or a prediction ? Both . And that was it . We went to bed . We did n't sleep . There 's sometliingabout one 's own bed , most belonging there . And the way he held ine . And thinking about what he 'd said , and how it had n't needed saying , it was almost insulting because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for one-night stands and then that I was too young and shallow and 197oish to understand love. 49It was square , anyway . But it also said he was less cool , or more vulnerable , than I believed . And something wicked : Daddy-o wants me . All his years , his women . Till suddenly I wanted , and truly to say yes , and turned to tell him . ( To be continued . It 's 1.3o , I'mn mad. ) 50The DoorDaniel ? It 's Nell . ' Who ? ' Your one-time wife .

She stares at him a moment , not laughing now , then looks down and turns away towards the centre of the room . Dan ? ' ' Jane . ' A strange mixture in his voice : both warmth and offence , and . dhove all incredulity . There is a tiny pause on the line . I feel awful disturbing you like this . So out of the blue . ' A longer ause . She says , Can you hear me ? ' It 's just that yours was the last voice in the world ... ' ' I 'm sorry . It was so kind of you to send that message via Caro .

' My erstwhile brother-in-law wants to see me . ' But I thought ... the one with cancer ? ' He swallows half the whisky . He stares down at the glass . He looks up at her , then down again . We were very close once , Jenny . I 've never really talked to you about all that . ' You told me they 'd excommunicated you .

We 've torn her apart for so long . I ca n't refuse the olive-branch now it 's offered . ' Why does he want to see you so much ? ' God knows . ' But you must have some idea .

In so many ways . ' Need someone . ' She turns from the couch and sits in an armchair , hunched forward , head bowed . I feel frightened already . ' That proves I 'm bad for you . And always would be . ' I 've got to decide about the new part . ' You know what I think . He 's a good man . He 'll get the script up . You should do it . ' And take myself off your hands .

And do n't change the subject . ' She draws on the cigarette , blows out smoke , then looks up at him . He still stands by the telephone . I notice you 're not admitting that I 'm also the best you 're likely to get . ' You 're shopping for bargains . ' You hide . That 's even worse . ' What do I hide ? ' Your past . ' Not cool . The past . ' That 's a stupid , slick , evasive , answer . ' She spaces the adjectives , like little whiplashes . He turns away . So is a great deal of my past . ' Stage point . Not a real one .

She would n't have broken so many years of silence without ... ' but he does n't finish . She withdraws her hand and turns away . He watches her light a cigarette by the couch . Why did it feel right to throw a full champagne bottle into a river ? ' It was just her way once of suggesting we 'd all been living in a false paradise at Oxford . ' He goes on a shade too quickly . All very involved . I 'll tell you one day . ' You do n't have to defend it . I just wondered . ' But she avoids his eyes . He says , Perhaps it 's for the best . ' Thanks very much . ' A breather .

A frontier . Whether you were born before 1939 or not . The world , time ... it slipped . Jumped forward three decades in one . We antediluvianshave been left permanently out of gear , Jenny . Your generation knows all about the externals . The visual things . What the Thirties and Forties looked and sounded like . But you do n't know what they felt like . All the ridiculous decors of the heart they left us encumbered with . ' She does not answer for a long moment . Had n't you better ring the airport ? ' Jenny . ' It 's not a chasm , Dan . It 's a deliberate barricade you erect . ' To protect both of us . ' She stubs out the cigarette . ' I 'm going to bed . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but stops there and looks back at him . You 'll please notice that I meticulously , scrupulously , do not58slam the door . ' And once through she sets it , with an ostentatious precision , half ajar . Then she glances up again at him . Okay ? Old-timer ? ' She vanishes . He sits in silence for a few seconds , then finishes the whisky . Then he goes to where his jacket lies and takes out a pocket-book , through which he leafs as he walks back towards the telephone . He dials a number and , waiting for an answer , stares back across to the bedroom door  --  which like that other door , like reality itself , that ultimate ambiguous fiction of the enacted past , seems poised eternally in two minds ; inviting , forbidding , accusing , forgiving ; and always waiting ... for someone at last to get the feeling right. 59AftermathThe police car dropped them at the top of the North Oxford road where Dan had his digs . The sky had clouded over completely , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the lines of solid Victorian houses , staid and donnish , too trite to be real . The wind had loosened some leaves . Autumn came drear and viciously premature . They said hardly a word until they were in his room . It was the best bed-sitter in the house , first-floor back , overlooking the garden ; but equally chosen for its landlady , a Woodstock Road Marxist who , having somehow got herself on the approved list , allowed her student lodgers freedoms unusual for the time . One put up with erratic meals and Communist Party pamphlets for the rare privilege of being able to do what one liked both with and in the privacy of one 's room . Dan 's exhibited what passed for advanced taste in 1950 . He had some private money besides his government grant and the Art Nouveau craze was still twenty years from ubiquity . Small portables in the style could be picked up for a shilling or two in any junkshop . What could one deduce today from photographs of that room ? Theatrical interests : a pinned-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still has somewhere and occasionally adds to ) , a toy theatre rather too prominently on a small table by the window over the garden , above the mantelpiece an original Gordon Craig set-design sketch ( then his proudest possession , foolishly given much later to the woman cited in his wife 's divorce action ) , a framed playbill with his own name on ( as joint librettist of the revue the previous winter ) , a batch of masks from a production of Anouilh 's Antigone ( hardly fin de siecle and already announcing a suspect eclecticism ) . Academic interests : a case of English literature texts and a cartoon on the wall showing Professor Tolkien being trampled underfoot by a Russian Stakhanovite bearinga lettered banner , on closer examination an undergraduate portingthe runic proclamation : Down with Anglo-Saxon . ( Of priceless value since The Lord of the Rings , but unfortunately burnt only three weeks from where we are , to be precise on the last day of the owner 's Final Schools , along with the abominable Beowulf and a number of other ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-class degree frequently admonished and duly received . ) Family background and personal life : difficult , yet the very paucity of evidence tells a tale . No family photographs , I seem to remember , though there was one , a blurred snapshot of an old stone doorway with the illegible ( but he knew it by heart ) date 1647 above , that half came into that category ; and there were very probablyon display some stills of the various other o u D S and E T C productions Daniel had had a hand in ; and there was certainly one , misty-edged and studio-posed , of Nell on the table used for a desk  --  and at present cluttered with all the evidence of panic cram . The most striking effect was of a highly evolved ( if not painfully out-ofhand ) narcissism , since the room had at least fifteen mirrors on its walls . True , they had been collected for their Art Nouveau frames , or at least allegedly ; but no other room in Oxford can have providedsuch easy access to the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lampooned ( if it was n't that at Oxford any lampooning is less cruel than none ) in an undergraduate magazinethe previous term . There had been a list of characters ' in the manner of La Bruyere . Daniel was dubbed Mr Specula Speculans , ' who died of shock on accidentally looking into a mirror without its glass and thereby discovering a true figure of his talents in place of the exquisite lineaments of his face ' . It must be remembered that this callow attempt at a personal decor existed against  --  or because of  --  a background of austerity , rationing , and universal conformity . Britain was still deep in a dream of siege . Of its time , it was daring . People who went to parties in it were honoured , and told less fortunate friends about it afterwards . An added piquancy was the well-known landlady downstairs , who raged against the viper she had taken to her bosom and the bourgeois decadence of his fancy pots and pieces and his general attitude to life  --  or so Dan liked to pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite her eccentricities , was no fool and knew her young men , and their potentialities for the cause , a6o 61good deal better than they knew themselves . Not one whom Dan had shared that house with , and who had like him in later life achieved some public notice , had become a Communist ; but rather more remarkably none had become a Conservative , either . Jane knew the room too well to notice it at all that afternoon . She went to the window and stared down at the garden . After a moment , she pulled off the red headscarf and shook her dark hair loose ; but still stood there holding the scarf , brooding . Do you want a drink , Jane ? ' She turned and smiled faintly . Tea ? ' ' I ' 11 go and fill the kettle . ' When he came back from the bathroom with it , he found her standing in the corner where he kept his exiguous kitchen . Only dried milk . ' It does n't matter . ' I could pinch some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' She 's out . ' Honestly . ' And she came with two cups and a teapot , spoons , and knelt by the fireplace . He put the kettle on the little electric coil he used for heating water , then went to the corner and fetched the dried milk , tea , sugar . Then he sat down on the rug opposite her and watched her measure out the black leaves into the pot . Is Nell coming round ? ' He shook his head . Essay night . ' She nodded . He sensed that she did not want to talk . Yet the feeling of emptiness in the silent house , in the day , in the time of day , made the vacuum embarrassing to him . Shall I put the fire on ? ' If you like . ' The gas-fire phutted at his match , began to flame blue and gold ; sparks of incandescent pink . The kettle started to add its slow voice . They echoed a kind of deep purr in Dan , for all his slight unease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster that then still seemed a joyous gift , was secretly rehearsing various amusing ways of telling what had happened : that pompous halfeducationof the policemen 's voices , Andrew 's impossibly blase behaviour , that I landed at Anzio , old man ' ... and then something rise , not only the event , the grey buttocks like uncooked tripe , the reported maggots seething in the hair ( which Dan would claim for his own eyes too )  --  but having been with Jane , the idol of her year , the almost celebrated already . All of young Oxford knew she must one day be more famous , truly famous , with those gifts ( much more serious than just taking off Rita Hayworth , her Vittoria in The White Devil had proved that beyond doubt ) and looks . She sat , one arm back , leaning sideways a little , staring into the gas-fire . Deep down it was n't her vivacities , her powers of mimicry , her mobility , all she could be on stage ; but what her face showed just then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people , one had long ago realized that , much more complicated than Nell ; which was what matched her , against all superficial probability , with Anthony , who was in so many ways the antithesis of them all  --  the Greats scholar from Winchester , already halfway to becoming a don , applied , logical ( in all except his religious beliefs , at that time almost as much a dandyism as collecting Art Nouveau mirror-frames ; rapidly analytical and aphoristic . Young Oxford men who were mature , like Mark , in terns of war and death were two a penny ; everyone knew the story of the proctors ' bulldog who had clapped hands on a student caught drinking in a pub  --  only to find that his victim was the young colonel whose batman he had been during the war . But Anthony had a different maturity , an apparently much surer knowledge of who he was and what he intended to be . He was widely envied Jane , but their relationship seemed incongruous only to people who knew neither of them well . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though less concisely , have put it at the time ; in simple fact he was in love with her . That was why he was embarrassed . For some months , at least two terms , he had known this ; and that he was trapped . His future marriage to her sister was broken long before that day . Webster 's immortal line : strange geometric hinges . His sense of guilt ought to have been attached to Nell ; but in fact it was much more orientated towards Anthony , and not at all , or very little , because on that particular occasion Anthony had granted himself a weekend 's break ( some monasteryin Gloucestershire that went in for the instant retreat ) from his final grind . Dan still felt a baffled privilege , to have got on so well with Anthony  --  baffled because he still could n't really understand what the brilliant Wykehamist saw in him . He knew much better what he had himself taken from the relationship  --  the contact with a much more fastidious and incisive intellect , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far less easily corrupted by new ideas and the ephemeral . In a way , Anthony was Oxford ; Dan was merely a visitor . He had learnt far more from him than from his tutors , if the truth were known . But there was that one great flaw : he could never quite shake off a deep , though carefully hidden , conviction that it was a friendship between unequals . In fairness to Dan , and to historical accuracy , it must be said that in terms of undergraduate prestige  --  so closely connected with undergraduate notoriety  --  his feeling of inferiority would have seemed odd to his contemporaries . He was a far better known , and perhaps even envied , student of his time than Anthony ; of that group who escape academy and achieve more than a mere college reputation and who , later , in retrospect , give their whole university generation its characteristic stamp . But like Jane , he was also two people , though far less prepared , or able , to admit it than she . Perhapsit was mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and in those towards Jane . He was even a little jealous of her gender , her young womanhood , which he felt allowed her both a more natural and a more mature attitude ; she could both mock and be affectionate in ways he could not . They would , in fact , usually take the same side in any argument against Anthony , conspiringin guying him gently if he became too outrageously the young don . But it was a stage alliance , would-be worldly-wise thespians sniping at intellectualism ; and hid the truth of where the realaffinities lay . So Dan watched this apparent proof , the prize he had not won  --  and , to complicate matters , which had even seemed partly stolen from him , since he had known Jane before Anthony , had even first introduced them , had really only held back before that introduction because he was in awe of her . Now he took what consolation he could from this substitute intimacy , in the softly hissing silence . The64sky seemed to grow darker , strangely dark for midsummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kettle boiled and Jane leant across and lifted it ; filled the pot . She was still filling it when she asked her astounding question . Do you and Nell go to bed together , Dan ? ' Her intent , downlooking face . Darling ... ' he gave a little puff of shocked amusement ; of pure shock , really . She did not smile , but set the kettle on the hearth before the fire . He had one virtue , I suppose , he read other people 's moods fast ; caught their intonations , usages , changed millimetres of mouth- and eye-shape ; but only the moods , not the intentions . He murmured , Has n't Nell ... ? ' Sisters do n't always talk about things like that . ' She put a spoonofmilk in each of the two cups . You mean you do ? ' Does n't everybody ? ' Again , they did n't , and far from it , in those days ; and the comparativelyfew that did kept up a convention of secrecy about it . But Dan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry far from innate sophistication under a bushel . One has to have me substitute for honesty . Anthony and I do n't . ' He could n't understand why she should want to tell him . KnowingAnthony 's views , he had not supposed that they did ; both he and Nell had decided quite definitely that they did n't . The Catholic thing ? ' She passed him his cup ; little flecks of undissolved white powder Hated on top . Yes. : ' It means a lot to him . ' Yes. : ' Under the squibs and epigrams . ' She smiled faintly , but for the second time that day she seemed to Iw reproaching Anthony . A shifting of deep grounds , a sudden ystery , a hinge 's first faint creak . She sipped her tea . ' I 'm not a virgin , Dan . There was someone else . In my first year . Before I met Anthony . ' Which pierced something hitherto virgin between them . He knows ? ' 65She made a wry grimace . This is rather why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal . ' ' Oh Gawd . ' It 's so stupid . If I 'd only told him at the beginning . Then it seemed too late . I 'm sort of trapped now . It 's not what I did . But that I have n't told him before . ' He offered her a cigarette , lit a spill and held it out , then lit his own . ' And he 's never thought to ask ? ' ' For someone so intelligent , he 's rather bizarrely trusting . He assumes things about people he 'd never assume about a theory of logic or a syllogism . ' She drew on the cigarette . ' At least that 's what I used to think . ' And now ? ' I wonder if he is n't rather frightened . Which frightens me every time I try to screw my courage up to tell him . ' You 'll have to tell him sonic time . ' I ca n't just before Finals . He 'd be bound to see it as ... ' ' As what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes she looked young , she did at that moment , staring into the fire , younger than Nell . The Jesuit in him . So badly timed , I must be trying to say sonicthingelse . He 'd look for it . ' Are you sure he does n't think about you as one more step in the dark ? She smiled . ' I suppose I am a stand-in for the whole shebang . Now you mention it . ' ' Is he putting a lot of pressure on  --  about the Catholic thing ? ? ' You know what he 's like . ' She shrugged . ' He does n't lay down the law . It 's all Gabriel Marcel and personal choice . Falling over himself not to decide for me . ' She leant back on an elbow , moving her legs from the warmth of the fire ; but still stared into it . I 've suddenly realized what Rabelais was on about this week . How he 's really more modern than all the St Germain-des-Pros crowd . Far more of an existentialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . When you think how utterly obsessed by self-denial England 's become . Outside the little world we 've made for ourselves here . I feel there 's something about Anthony and his religious side that's66rather the same . Always thinking about the past and worrying about the future . Never actually managing to enjoy the present . And Rabelais is just one gorgeous long raspberry in the face of all that . There are passages , you ... you suddenly feel he 's the only sane human being who ever lived . ' She stared at her cigarette . ' I tried to explain all this to Anthony the other evening . ' And he did n't quite follow . ' ' On the contrary . Everything . Except the fact that I 'd just been to bed with the man . In spirit . ' Dan grinned down . But you did n't quite put it that way . ' ' It 's how it felt . Adultery as well as heresy . Especially when he read the ethical riot act over my poor little female mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . ' ' Of course not . He was quite funny . Because he was so sure I could n't be serious . ' She began tracing patterns in the worn Turkish carpet beneath the rug . His problem is he can only be himself . You and I can be other people . ' ' Now you 're denying him imagination . That 's not fair . ' ' Not imagination . But acting on it . He could never write plays . Novels . Anything where you have to be someone else . Not in a thousand years . ' There was a silence ; suddenly she shifted ground . ' I ca n't make out if Nell likes him or not . ' Again he was shocked . Of course she does . You know she does . ' She does n't realize lie disapproves of her ? ' Dan gave her a quick look then ; but her eyes remained on the carpet . ' That 's news to me too , Janey . ' Liar : it was long sensed , and feared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cracks , reversals of time ; was hinged indeed . It seemed there was almost a malice in her , a determination to force scales from his eyes ; and at the same time a nakedness , as she let him see all these buried feelings . ' He does try to hide it . Even from me . ' But what 's he got against her , for God 's sake ? ' I suppose he suspects you go to bed . Fears something in me that lie fears in her . He does rather take the sexpot image at face value . But that 's at least half a mask . He knows that . ' 67'I know . ' And I 'm just as bad . ' ' No , you pass . You 're a child of nature . His proof he 's not a prig . ' She slid hiui a glance . ' Is all this shocking you ? ' I think lie 's being terribly inauthentic. ' ' 1 le 's also authentically fond of you both . ' ' Thanks a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But lie ca n't have it both ways . He ca n't pretend to our faces that he likes Nell  --  and then pity me or something for having fallen into the clutches of the Scarlet Woman of Babylon . ' Fear for you . ' He stared at her , but her own eyes were lost in the fire . Again he felt left a step behind . ' Is this what you were trying to say on the river ? About Nell and me getting married ? ? ' How do you mean ? ' ' In your and Anthony 's considered opinion , we should n't ? ' It 's not something I have a considered opinion about . ' He was silent , then gave a sour little sniff . ' I thought at least we'dgained your qualified approval . ' He went on : ' So why did you sayNell was lucky ? ? ' Because I think she is . ' She said slowly , And I have n't got a considered opinion because I 'm not able to judge properly . ' Once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why not ? ? ' Because . ' Come on . ' Her voice dropped . Because I 'm jealous of her . ' Because the bed thing 's not a problem ? ' That would be just envy . I said jealousy . ' It took a moment or two to sink in . But the intentness of her eyes on the carpet ... he looked down at his own stretched-out legs , he was sitting with his back to the wall beside the fire ; and felt like someone led blindfold to a precipice . She murmured in the silence , 1  --  ais ce gtue i , oudras . T'his is getting rather complicated . ' ' Perhaps it 's a long overdue simplification . ' 63But you and Anthony , I thought ... ' She turned away on the other elbow . He stared at her back . All this summer , whenever the four of us have been together , you wo n't look at me . Unless you absolutely have to .

Nell and Anthony had gone on ahead . He had been very conscious of her hand lightly in his in the darkness ... but it had not said this . I thought it was just sisterly . ' I hated Nell that whole evening . I had no nice sisterly feelings atAll. , There was silence . The back of her head , the line of her body . The rain had lessened , but it stayed overcast .

' Except there are simple ways of treating ' flu . ' She left a pause . One usually goes to bed , does n't one ? A long moment . He whispers , Jane ? She lies curled away , perched on an elbow . You ca n't really mean that . ' 69She shook her head . It 's so difficult to explain . I feel in some way Anthony 's made me miss something . What you and Nell have . What my body dreams . ' Rabelais ? ' I suppose to be wild and wanton . ' Wild and wanton ' was a stock undergraduate phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because I love him . ' She added , Want to love him . ' He felt more and more out of his depth , yet unable not to go on . Want to know if you can love him ? There vas a silence , and when she broke it her voice was so low he hardly heard the words . Just once . An actegratuit ? He stared at his shoes . And tomorrow ? ? ' if we knew exactly what we were doing . That we could keep it ... outside time . As an exorcism . ' He swallowed secretly . An exorcism of what ? ? ' What must happen . What will happen . ' Knowing we love each other ? ? ' Knowing we once wanted each other . And that at least once we 'd had the courage to admit it . ' He could feel his sexual excitement on the rise ; and an ungovernabledesire not to resist it , despite what he then said . I do n't know how we could ever face them . ' We seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other . ' He said , It 's not that I ... ' but once again his sentence floated away . He felt paralysed , stunned by the enormity , ravished by the strangeness . The silence grew , and she did not move . From across the gardens at the back there drifted through the rain the sound of an oboe , a rise and descent of progressive scales , skilled and rapid . Then a break . She sat up and faced him . He felt she vas looking at him for the first time . Those gentle but penetrating brown eyes , searching his ; something oddly virginal about her at that moment , of a schoolgirl , 70a seventeen-year-old frightened at what her elder selfhad done ; but with a faint mule that did not deny , yet somehow counterbalanced the innocence . Perhaps it was provoked by something still wavering in his own expression , for the smile also held a tiny hint of a challenge ; or of a tease , as if she were proposing no more than a dare . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her free hand across the rug , almost formally , like a medieval bride . PassageDaniel nearly missed his flight , owing to a traffic snarl-up . For once the sky was almost smogless , a lovely midwinter Californian morning . The grey-haired Polish cab-driver kept cursing freeways in general and the San Diego in particular , but he was in far more of a rage about it than his fare : an I in the hands of fate , Isherwood 's camera , not unhappily reduced to watching himself , as if he were indeed a fiction , a paper person in someone else 's script ... the seed of a hypothesis , like the Simon Wolfe ' planted in his mind the night before . Perhaps that ancient jibe about him , Mr Specula Speculans , had not been quite fair : a love of mirrors may appear to be only too literally prima facie evidence of narcissism , but it can also be symbolicof an attempt to see oneself as others see one  --  to escape the first person , and become one 's own third . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissal Daniel knew perfectly well was on the one hand a cheap conditioningof his metier and on the other a product of the lazy assumption that he was long past finding in himself , poor asthmatic cripple , the athleticism of imagination and long wind the form must need ) he reserved an especially , and symptomatically , dark corner for firstpersonnarration ; and the closer the narrative I approximated to what one could deduce of the authorial I , the more murky this corner grew . The truth was that the objectivity of the camera correspondedto some deep psychological need in him ; much more to that than to the fundamental principle of aesthetic ( and even quasimoral ) good taste that he sometimes pretended lay behind his instinct here . What did dimly occur to him as he sat half-listening and halfabettinghis driver 's determination to show that he was now truly American  --  America is a perfect society , perfect societies have no snarls and flaws , so what the goddam hell is going on  --  was that perhaps this flinching from the I inherent in any honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment ; and that(Jenny 's reported remark concerning perfectionism had also lodged much closer home than she may have realized ) doing what he obscurelywanted was intimately bound up with doing what he obscurely hated . He even tried it out : I missed my flight ( or I nearly missed my flight ) , owing to a traffic hold-up on the San Diego freeway '  --  anddid not like the sound and feel of it one bit . At last they began to crawl forward , to within sight of the accident , the flashing lights , that were causing the stopped lines of impotent quadrirotal man . In his characteristic English fashion , Dan carefully filed away this added reason for why he was condemned to be what he was ; how clear it was , if he ever did attempt the impossible , that anything would be better than to present it in the first person ... even the absurdity of a mythical Simon Wolfe . I was also very tired that morning . Jenny had n't released me for another hour . There had been tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for the first time over our private relationship . The idea for her picture had come during a stint on another script in Hollywood three years previously . The studio had found me one of those British girl secretaries who work their way round the States  --  though not very attractive physically , she had possessed a sense of humour and a long tongue . I enjoyed her dry coffee-break accounts of her various work-experiences and abortive romances before she came to me , I 'd long wanted to contrive something on the Anglo-American cultural comedy ... so jenny was now a trained English nanny in a millionaire household in one of the chic canyons , fighting a losing battle against both her employers and her off-duty boyfriend  --  Steve Anderson 's part . She could play the character close enough to her real self Steve was and is the most frightful young bore , but his part also offered scope for his real-life fixations and dedicated self-involvement . I 'm afraid director and scriptwriterhad deliberately cultivated a certain amount of off-camera antipathy between their two stars . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to respect Steve in the can , if not in the flesh . On screen , in the rushes , her controlled insularity and his would-be Method ' sloppinessmixed rather well ... as we had hoped . We had also lied about his not being our first choice . It was a white lie , since we had very much wanted a girl to whomthe Califoruiau dreamanightmare was as fresh in reality as it had to be in the story . I knew how insidious the place is , how fast it warps the stranger to its own peculiar ways , so her virginity there was important . That also meant the film was going to be a tougher propositionthan she realized . I played pig at Claridges partly for this reason : to warn her that whatever her local successes she was now stepping out of home movies , in both senses , into a very different and potentially much more lonely world . Then we were scared she might be overawed by Steve 's ill-deserved reputation ( and get to hear how much more he was taking ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , for purely professional reasons ... which became more personal ones , of course , though I liked her all the better for apparently deciding that she did n't need my help . She showed a brisk blend of tact and independence , ancestral Scottish qualities I value far more than the second sight . Like so many pretty , and far from stupid , girls in the business she was in a slight dilemma  --  incipiently crucified by her own good looks . It is not perhaps the kind of crucifixion the ordinary girl can have much sympathy for ; nevertheless , it exists ... and Jenny had the camera image that conforms too closely to current notions of what is sexually desirable in young women to escape . A certain leggy fragility , an elegant insouciance , a well-boned , fine-mouthed , candid-eyed eager frankness about the face ... a nice ongoing kid , the lens said , searching as well as enticing to go to bed with ; a twentieth-century princess , provoking very nearly the same dream as the real princesses who had once languished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of the unattainable . She had done a little modelling work at home , and knew well enough how to get herself up to kill , and to project ' , vanities she did n't always resist . Even tired , with her completely natural face , she could n't always lose that air of vacuous distinction and effortless beauty that highly photographable women , the Shrimptons and Twiggics of this world , acquire . She was conscious of it , of course ; and had a special clown 's grimace for when she knew I had caught that look . I remember another evening , we 'd been to a party and she had looked ravishing even with some expert competition , and I said so when we got home . She went straight into the bathroom and74washed her face off . When she came out she said , I forbid you to like me for that . ' This problem of being her own young woman , not just the chauvinistic male world 's dream of the type , distorted her in another way : her frostiness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes painfully gauche  --  and indeed misled me in the beginning . It was right for the part , that aloofness ; but in private I found it rather silly , ail this gazelle-like shying-away from the slightest wrong approach , even though she grew to hide it better . Another self , both warmer and less assured , I caught only glimpses of in the early days . None of us could really get near her , and it was hard to tell what was genuine and what was being tried out in pursuit of a working persona in a very alien environment . It was Bill who warned me that she might be withdrawing too mach . By then the thought of giving her a shoulder to rest on was not just a matter of production need or simple human charity , yet there did remain an element of calculation ... which remained in substance , even if it changed in nature . She did need me , or someone like me , in Los Angeles ; but it remained very open whether she needed me anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very real affection . I could have fallen heavily for her , and become intolerably possessive ; but I had sinned in that area often enough before to know that to take one 's partner 's independenceas a challenge is the straight road to disaster . Wanting her was bound up with the notion of changing her , and I liked her too well as she was . Just as I believe in God ' is generally a synonym for I believe in not thinking ' , only too frequently I love you ' is a euphemism for I want to own you ' . I sincerely wanted to leave Jenny in the public gallery of her own freedom ; and at the same time I was still also in love with both her body and her independence . The tears were partly spoilt-child tears , glycerine drops ; and also more genuine ones . I gave way to the blackmail . We 'd forget the whole evening , it had never happened . She 'd fly back as soon as she vas released . It was just a temporary separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . Then I had driven back to Bel-Air , which is not where any Englishman in Los Angeles can normally afford to live  --  and where7iI lived purely by kindness and an old friendship . An early script I did for Columbia failed to meet with studio approval and they brought in Abe Nathan to help me rewrite it . He had more or less given up the trade by then , but he was still on call for crises . I was piqued , and prepared not to like him one bit . But not all studio decisions are crass . The story needed the doctor ' , and I needed the lesson ; I fell for the professionalism , and even more for Abe himself  --  as I did for his wife Mildred when I came to know her as well . He might wear the full livery the old Hollywood forced on its educated slaves  --  be cynical , lugubrious , obscene , suspect the worst of everything and everybody  --  but he failed abysmally to hide the fact that this persona was very largely a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appearance of a dangerous one ) ; and that underneath the waspishness lay a shrewd , humane and fundamentally tolerant mind . I had let him read every one of my scripts ever since . Even though the recipes of his own heyday no longer worked , he retained a very sure nose for the weak spots in the new ones  --  and in much else besides . Mildred and he live in the wilder , less posh section of Bel-Air  --  where the quail still speak Spanish ' . Theirs is not the opulent mansionthe place is more famous for ... not even a swimming-pool , though that is an invert ostentation ; but a pleasantly ramshackle garden , incongruously studded with classical statues , the weatherproofedplaster props from some forgotten Roman epic , with the cabin ' up the hill . Abe built it to write in himself , but he had long let me appropriate it when I was in town . It lacks one or two hotel amenities , but is buried in greenery and birds ' voices . I can be alone there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like Los Angeles , increasingly detest those famous hundred suburbs in search of a city . But Abe , Mildred and the Cabin would make hell itself tolerable . I had packed when I got back there , then snatched four hours ' sleep , to be woken by Jenny 's voice again on the telephone . Her own wake-up call had just come in . She was her normal self again ; apologized for being silly ' . Need was re-affirmed . I would broach the matter of her taking over the Cabin . I would call from home as soon as I could . I went down to the house . Abe was already about and he gave me coffee , while I told him my news . Of course jenny could take overthe Cabin if she liked ; whichever , he and Mildred would see she did n't get too lonely . I wanted this for more than the obvious kind reasons , since Mildred and he represent a formidable combination of Jewish common-sense and New England frankness . Few secrets survive for long near them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my presence , to be their temporary shiksa daughter instead of my cute little British bird . I was hopeful that as soon as she revealed my view of our relationship , they would take my side . They approved of Jenny as a person , but not of cradle-snatching . They also knew my past much better than she did ... and my faults . There was an element of doing a far , far better thing , killing two laps es with one exit  --  but we really were viable only in a culture where nobody ever grows old ( especially if they are rich and successful ) and trading in well-screwed for younger flesh is an accepted way of life . I had known a number of father-daughter marriages there . The girls were n't all the high-class platinum hookers of the old days ; most were rather demure and reserved creatures , and some even had a sort of dignity , or perhaps it was just a smooth complacency at having side-stepped the tedium of being young and broke . It was the men who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too much sense , too close an attachment to the freedoms of her generation , ever to deny herself the full potentialities of her future ... and however hard I might have tried to subvert her from them . She had , or sometimes pretended with me that she had , a jejune notion that she 'd seen it all ; that I was , as she brutally ( too brutally to be convincing ) estimated , the best she was likely to get . But that was a nonsense passing time must explode . I had no right to encourage such an illusion ; and I had categorically no wish to pick up the emotional tab when it was shattered . I suppose the experience with Nell formed me there , no doubt on a predisposed Freudian pattern . Living with a woman has always seemed to me an artificial situation , pseudo-dramatic in nature ; that is , an area where invention and concealment are as important as reality and honesty . I have always needed secrets . I write that clinically , not vainly . I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rid my life of them , the least I can do is to hide them from my lady guests ... that is the practical theory , at any rate . Perhaps I had grown to like Abe and Mildred so much simply because they76 1 77were clear proof that the theory is inadequate ; that better relationshipscan exist . They are two people who have principally defined my own Englishness by their lack of it . I once outraged them both by arguing that most English anti-semitism , like most English antiAmericanism , sprang out of sheer envy . They did not like simple evil explained as complex loss , or failure to evolve . You poor sons of bitches , snarled Abe , deprived of the gas-ovens ... but that was n't the point . We took off . After a minute , by craning back , I could even make out Burbank and the roofs of the Warner lot stages , under one of which jenny must have been facing the first take of the day . I did feel a guilt then , tenderness , a protectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle-aged woman I had spoken to the previous night might once conceivably have been , and I knew she had n't fully accepted that as yet : the closed options , the comproulisesto come . East , at altitude , over the deserted mountains of North Arizona and the toy gash of the Grand Canyon : there had been talk between jenny and myself of driving back overland when her work was done . But that was a foregone experience I did n't regret , since there was another chasm beside that of age . The life we led in Los Angeles had allowed us to overlook it , turn it into another toy gash of no more than a trivial passing significance ; but in another context , on the ground , I knew it would always have presented a much more formidable obstacle . It was my fault , in the sense that I had effectivelyreduced it to the status of one more secret about my past ... though in this case , not only with jenny . Anthony and I originally moved from cursory acquaintance  --  being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared staircase to our rooms  --  to friendship precisely because of this secret ' . I was already engaged in burying or suppressing it , but it was still close enough in my past to be partially uncovered . The summer term of 1948 , our first university year : by chance I went into his sitting-room one day . Our shared servant was retiring and I was collecting for a leaving present for him . On Anthony 's desk I saw a flower in a jamjar  --  a stem of the Man Orchid , Aceras . A few moments later we discovered a common interest , though78with me it Nvas largely a memento , an cclio of former days . With him it was far more serious ; as with so much in his life , such an interest could be only methodical , deeply pursued , or non-existent . Scientifically I had learnt enough botany as a schoolboy to find my way round the old copy of Bentham and Hooker we had at home ; and I had in my teens fallen prey a little to the orchid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby disclaimed the whole buried continent that nature had been for me in my adolescence . I was ashamed of it already , and nothing in his obviouslymuch greater expertise encouraged me to reveal the truth ... then or later . I had always thought Anthony priggishly above the rest of us , a typical Greats scholar . He dressed rather formally , and there was a kind of studied quickness , a purpose , when he walked across the quad that I 'd always found affected . He seemed to have few friends . On the other hand ( one must put it in such childish terms ) he did n't wear glasses or hunch  --  nor did he belong to that equally disagreeablefaction , the hearty . He was slightly taller than me , with very regular features and vaguely challenging eyes  --  though I think that was simply because he had the curiously un-English habit of looking you in the face when he talked to you . I now found , as we talked about orchids , that they could also be amused and friendly eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how serious I was . I was flattered , I suppose  --  this apparently fastidious and already reputedly brilliant young professor in embryo had time for me . He once said , years later , when I 'd been ribbing him about a newspaper report of some flagrantly fake stigmatization in Italy , I 'm surprised you do n't believe in miracles , Dan . How else did we meet ? He took me out to Watlington one day very soon afterwards ; and that led to other days , and other knowledges of each other . But we first surmounted the barriers between us across orchids . Barriers there were ; we were very different young men , even in college and university terms . I was already writing for magazines , had one foot in the university theatrical door ; wore a frivolous ( and very false persona , did an absolute minimum of academic work . I knew a lot of people , I would have said I had a lot of friends , but they were almost all like myself , at Oxford to mix , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less by real affection and interest than79by a common love of the exhibitionistic . My own personality had undergone a very thorough revolution since adolescence , and even since my arrival at Oxford after war service . I had rejected so much . I was writing myself , making myself the chief character in a play , so that I was not only the written personage , the character and its actor , but also the person who sits in the back of the stalls admiring what he has written . All my other friends ' were also more or less on stage ; the difference with Anthony was that he sat beside me in the stalls . With the orchids , I took his view : one must keep such interests to oneself and fellow-enthusiasts , and not bore other people with them . He was n't a nature-lover at all , I did n't realize that at the time . He just happened to be a crack field botanist  --  which goes also , I suspect , for his subsequent professional work as a philosopher . But I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his books . When he became a don , philosophy became like botany , he would n't talk about it any more to the lay world . Another even more important realization came much later : that he was a kind of father-substitute , though we were almost exactly the same age . The idea would have outraged me at the time , and killed the friendship , as I believed I had consciously killed ' the spirit of my father and his antiquated world . I do not know if Anthony realized this . He was certainly sufficiently astute to have done so , though he had no time for Freud . I am trying to say that he was good for me in the sense that he resurrected , if only very tenuously and intermittently , a self  --  or an unresolved dilemma  --  I had foolishly tried to dismiss ; and nefarious in the sense that our relationship was set in a minefield . In our orchid-hunting I never really rose above the role of shikari  --  I found the game , he shot it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first ( and last , alas ) Monkeys near Goring , a solitary Fly under a sunshot whitebeam at the edge of a Chiltern becchwood . His heaven was a wet meadow full of dull old Dactylorchids : countingand measuring and noting down the degree of hybridization . I wanted to find the flowers , he wanted to establish some new subspecies . I lived ( and hid ) poetic moments ; he lived Druce and Godfery . My solitary boyhood had forced me to take refuge in nature as a poem , a myth , a catalysis , the only theatre I was allowed to know ; it was nine parts emotion and sublimation , but it acquiredSoan aura , a mystery , a magic in the anthropological sense . I have spent years of my adult life ignoring it , but the long traumas of adolescence stamp deep . It still takes very little , a weed in flower at the foot of a concrete wall , the flight of a bird across a city window , to reimmerseme ; and when I am released from deprivation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared driving across America with Jenny simply because I knew we should pass so many places where on my own I should have stopped ; not as a serious naturalist would have stopped , though I might have pretended that , but as a bitter and repressed child once hid in the green Devon countryside . All that side of me remained completely overborne in Anthony 's antiseptic presence ; nor did I see his singlemindedness then as a defect  --  it simply proved the hidden softness and greenness in myself . Lying about it all began with him ... and with Nell and Jane , too . I knew Jane only very slightly during that first year ; she was already talked about , had already made a hit in the ouDS , whereas I knew myself still very immature . Nell had n't appeared then . One day at the Kemp , wanting to show off to Anthony , I introduced him to her . She was groaning about Descartes , some essay she had to write ; Anthony began to explain . I had to go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such unlikely people should have found anything in common . It did n't happen overnight . I think he took her out a couple of times before term ended . They spent the long vacation apart , but apparently they wrote letters ; and by the end of the calendar year , they were paired off . And Nell had arrived , my consolation prize . She was prettier than Jane , and the later sexpotpersona was still hidden behind the freshwoman 's reserve . I thought we were perfectly matched , the four of us . I enjoyed , when access was granted , Nell 's naked body very much , and throughout my second year that obscured my real feelings . During our two remaining summers as students the two girls often came on our orchid expeditions ; and always mocked us in their different ways . I must n't make Anthony sound humourless , but he had everything neatly compartmented in his life . All obsessionwas bad taste . He seldom laughed at himself , but he would always laugh at the girls ' teasing . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in-joke among us . I was never quite sure what it81meant , but it always made us twist With secret laughter . WC used it most against other people . In a way it mule Anthony the odd man out ; and hid the truth . That is , I was the real outsider . For the girls , nature was an occasion for drifting walks and idle picnics , listening to the nightingales on Otmoor while Anthony and I botanized ; for him , a crossword puzzle , a relief in concrete objects from abstract ideas . And for me all I would never regain . When much later , after the divorce and the vitriol , I felt that I had finally set this side of myself in perspective , the solution seemed simple . But putting down new roots , after all that had happened , in an early landscape was much more difficult than I had imagined . I got bored at the farm in Devon , I grew lonely , I found the magic I remembered had somehow disappeared and that the nature of actuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course failed to see how much the past magic had depended on past deprivation ; and the present deprivation was of all that I had constructedto take its place . I began my peripatetic existence , working more and more away from Thorncombe . Only frequent exile made the place possible . I was also trapped by a far more spurious myth and magic , since all this coincided with growing success in the film world , which presented me with a renewed opportunity  --  akin in essence if not in detail to my reaction to Oxford  --  to wear a mask and invent a character ... once more to write myself . I let myself be dazzled by the gilt chimeras of the career : that happiness was always having work , being in demand , belonging nowhere , the jet life , the long transatlantic phone-call about nothing . I became one third American and one third Jewish ; the one third English I camped up or suppressed , according to circumstances . Jenny is right : I used it as a weapon when I was bored , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cinderella role . It was vilely exploited by the other two of me . I even thought of getting rid of Thorncombe , I used it so little . It distressed me when I returned after long infidelities , and seemed to show those mute reproachful eyes that forsaken gardens and buildings acquire . I would see the way some tree or shrub I had planted had grown , and long for that close daily knowledge of the82little world around one that only peasants understand . Then I would once more fall in love with the place . It came less to matter that I knew that within a fortnight I should feel restless again . Thorncombe felt right ; and I was wrong . Perhaps all this is getting near the heart of Englishness : being happier at being unhappy than doing something constructive about it . We boast of our genius for compromise , which is really a refusal to choose ; and that in turn contains a large part of cowardice , apathy , selfish laziness  --  but it is also , I grow increasingly certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar imagination , of our racial and individual gift for metaphor ; for allowing hypotheses about ourselves , and our pasts and futures , almost as much reality as the true events and destinies . Other races look at themselves in the mirror , and either live with the reflection or do something practical to improve it . We paint an ideal , or a dream , self on the glass and then wallow in the discrepancy . Nothing distinguishes us more clearly from the Americans , nothing characterizes better the very different ways we use our shared language  --  the way they use it as a tool , even when they are being poetic , and the way we treat it as a poem , even when we are using it as a tool ; and it is the same with the enormous semantic subtleties of middle-class English intonation and the poverty of nuance in even the most intellectually sophisticatedAmerican equivalent . These two dialects seem to me two reactions to the same thing : the craving for freedom . The American myth is of free will in its simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself ; and this absurdly optimistic assumption so dominates the republic that it has bred all its gross social injustices . Failure to succeed proves a moral , not a genetic , fault . All men are born equal ' becomes No decent society can help those who fail to stay equal ' . The myth becomes so pervasive that it even ends up as the credo of those , the underprivileged , who most need to disbelieve it . I have seen it in even the most intelligent liberals there , people like Abe and Mildred , impeccably sympathetic in their attitude to things like Medicare , Black anger , environmental control and all the rest ; yet still they hanker after the old and other American dream of freedom to cash in on other people 's inequality . From the beginning Americans came to America to escape two things : political tyranny and fixed83one . I had no project in mind after the wretched Kitchener script . I could n't get out of that , I was contractually committed ; but both man and period , in the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . With my daughter Caro now working and Nell long remarried , I could n't even pretend that I had needed the money , so I had had to look for some other motive ; and I had decided that it was essentially a need to validate self-contempt , to create one last straw that broke the conditioned camel 's back . I remember , when Anthony and Jane and Nell and I spent our summer in Rome , standing before some comically awful painting of a saint flagellating himself . Even Jane , a convert by then , found it ridiculous , Catholicism gone dotty  --  which allowed Anthony to put us right on the principle , if not this present manifestation of it : how self-mortification was universal because it was absurd and necessary . He based a great deal on the absurd-and-necessary at that time  --  and in that side of his life  --  and I did n't take it very seriously , having already made something of an art of not causing myself anything but pleasure . But here I was , over twenty years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man I liked less the more I knew about him , and a project of formidable technical difficulties ; and not even allowed to write , given the production cost of sinking old cruisers , the one scene I would have enjoyed ... the old buffer disappearingforever beneath the waves off the Orkneys . And what should follow that , I did not know . I was not really flying to New York , and home ; but into an empty space. odds in the struggle for life , and they have never realized that the two aims are profoundly hostile to each other  --  that the genetic injustice of life is just as great as the old European economic injustice . Their system dealt with the latter by assuming an equal dispensationof energy , talent and good luck to all men ; and now they are smashed hard on the reef of the far deeper injustice . All this was of course also the English assumption in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . But we have long abandoned it . Injustice and inequality are in the nature of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all living reality . It is a thing in the mind , a Utopia we secretly retreat to from our daily ordinary world ; just as I have always lived far more in the mind at Thorncombethan in reality . That is what permits in England our extraordinarytolerance of national decay , of muddling through ; our socializing conservatism and our conservative socialism . Our society , and its actual state , is nothing ; merely the dead real world , not the living imaginary one ; and that is why we have evolved a language that always means more than it says , both emotionally and imaginatively . With the Americans it is the reverse : they mean and feel far less than they have the habit of saying . In both cases , it is to the same end : to find a place to be free . The outward cynics may live in the States ; but the fundamental ones , the true quietists , live in Britain . I am trying to exculpate myself , not explain cultures . My attitude to nature , my past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own history and genetic make-up ; it is also because I am English . But to make the flight from California and Jenny , that bout of selfpitythe previous night , seem some kind of positive ( or American ) response to all this would be very false . I had no serious desire to examine my past or recreate it in any shape or form ; and of course I cheat here . One does not think coherently without a much stronger pretext than mere time to spare . Anything that makes the dozing man in the 707 that day , stuck in what is after all only a continuity shot , high over the monotonous rectangled wheatlands of the Midwest , appear in the least certain of what he was doing would be absurd . Perhaps the only symptom of imminent life-change was a negative84My mother died just before my fourth birthday , and I really can not remember her at all ; only the dimmest ghost of a bed surmounted by a tired brown face  --  the brownness being due to the illness that killed her , Addison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic side and the unmarried of his two sisters had moved in long before the death . Being a parson 's child helped . There was no doubt , when I was little , that the brown face had gone to Heaven ' . In that at least I was lucky to be born where I was ; four generations into the Church of England , with a substitute mother who would have done very well as the nicest kind of practical Anglican nun . Aunt Millie was ineffably devoted to making good , and one of the few things I regret bitterly ( as opposed to merely regretting ) was that I never gave her enough credit for it . She had to bear the brunt of so much that I dared not reproach my father with . When I was young , I took her for granted ; when I grew up , I despised her for her dowdiness and her simplicity ; at her funeral ten years ago I had tears in my eyes , and perhaps that will gain me a slight remission on Judgment Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always seemed old to me , more like a grandfather than a father . Having married very late , he was only a year short of fifty when I was born , and his hair was almost white by the time I begin to see him clearly . If I have to use one phrase to describe his attitude to me , it must be something like a detached and quizzical puzzlement . From the photographs it seems clear my mother was no beauty ; she was thirty herself when they married , and some kind ofWhat can a flame remember ? If it remembers a little less than is necessary , it goes out ; if it remembers a little more than is necessary , it goes out . If only it could teach us , while it burns , to remember correctly . The Umbrella86GEORGE SEFERIS : ' Man ' secret I have never quite pierced lay over her . It certainly was n't . uiything sinful , but more to do with a suggestion of folly on my father 's part . He never reminisced about her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ( her gentleness , her respect for my father , her gift for music ) that suggested some defect had to be excused . One defect was certainly of birth . She had been one of his parishionersin Shropshire , where he had a living before I came into the world , and her parents had been grocers  --  quietly successful ones , ' provision merchants ' was Aunt Millie 's description . Like her son , she was an only child . She seems to have become a village spinster when they died ; educated and provided for , but I suppose with the classification of trade ' . She played the organ in his church . I ca n't imagine what happened , whether in some innocent village way she trapped my father , or whether it was a case of two profound sexual timidities , a scholarly and a genteel , taking refuge in each other 's arms . Much later , in the Fifties , a letter came out of the blue from a woman who had read a newspaper interview with me , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more about herself , she had a dress-shop in Birmingham , but she remembered my mother from before the marriage , that she sewed beautifully and had a medlar-tree in her garden . She did n't know why she remembered the medlars , which she spelt meddlers . I answered her letter politely , in the kind of way that discourages further communication . When I bought Thorncombe , I got a medlar and planted it ; but it died two years later . My father : it was n't until I went to boarding-school that I realized how outstandingly dull he was as a preacher , a handicap which was partly imposed by his general humourlessness and partly by his lifelonghabit of sailing high over village heads . He was not at all a religious or a saintly man , even by the modest standards of the Church of England . He was something of a theologian , but rather in the way an army officer might have an interest in regimental history . He had a considerable collection of sermons and doctrinal pamphlets from the seventeenth century ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once went with him into the pulpit . I used to cringe with embarrassment , sitting in the Vicarage pew and seeing how restless he would make the congregation as he87droned  --  he had a special pulpit voice some of the cheekier village boys had the knack of imitating , especially when they met me out of range of adult ears  --  interminably on towards Sunday lunch ; or luncheon , as it was always called . I have admired the pruned and clipped ever since . He conditioned me there , as in so many things , by antithesis . I sent him , during my first term at Oxford , just before he died , an Arber reprint of Hugh Latimer 's 1549 Sermon on the Ploughers , one of the greatest pieces of hammering prose-poetry in the history of the English language , let alone the English church . He thanked me for it , but made no comment . It was meant to be a gentle revenge , but I think he took it as a sign that what he saw as certain doubts in me might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phrase I once heard him use in a sermon on a characteristically irrelevant favourite bee in his pulpit bonnet : recruitment to the ministry .

One of his more educated wartime churchwardens had the temerity to suggest that a few more topical allusions would not come amiss ; but father remained convinced that the village had quite enough of all that in the newspapers and on the wireless , and continued adamantly in his old course . On another wartime occasiona Negro chaplain from the American camp near by came and preached to a packed church  --  drawn not by piety but by curiosity to see how this mysterious chimpanzee would perform . He had a fine voice and presence , and a touch of the revivalist in manner ; and he stunned us , he was so warm and good . But not my father , who in a rare descent to cattiness condemned him in private afterwards as over-enthusiastic ' . He was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the following week he went fifteen minutes over time on the Arian heresy , just to put us all in our place . I can see now that his real fear was of any nakedness of feeling . He had a bizarre use of the word demonstrate ' , which he twisted , or spread , to include any exhibition of anger , conviction , tearfulness ... any strong emotion , however innocent or justified . Other visiting preachers who showed a touch too much fervour , protesting parties in some village argument , even myself unfairly blamed for some misdemeanour ... if only the good man would rely less on the demon-88strative ; all this demonstration does n't help the lady 's cause ; do not demonstrate so , Daniel . It was not that he would have expected me to sit silent , if I had a reasonable excuse ; simply that I had dared to advance natural temperament as self-justification . The word covered countless other things , in my case : sullenness , excitement , even mere boredom . He had some extraordinary Platonic notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he counted as ' demonstration ' were missing , or totally controlled . I dread to think what he would have made of the more recent political sense of the verb and noun . Yet  --  or perhaps , the English being what they are , because of this  --  he was counted a good parish man . He was endlessly patient with the most garrulous old spinsters , sympathetic to the ( slightly ) more enlightened . Like many Devon villages , we had no real squire  --  there were various larger country houses in neighbouring combes where we were on visiting terms , but in the village itself he was the de facto social and symbolic tribal chief ; on every committee , consultedover everything . I think he filled that role well enough . He certainly believed in it , which was one good reason he was not truly religious . His real faith was in order ; and his mildly privileged place in it . There were peasants ; there were farmers and shopkeepers and , during the war , a heterogeneous collection of elderly evacuees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was never allowed a shadow of a doubt ( perhaps because the truth about my mother 's background might have created one ) as to where we belonged . Proof hung forever on the dining-room wall ; an oil-painting of my great-grandfather , a bishop no less . To be fair , and even if his marriage had not proved it , father was not a snob . We might be out of a better drawer than the rest of the village , but we must never show it . No distinction was ever to be made between those it was our duty to be with pastorally and those it was pleasant to be with socially . In essence he was a subtle  --  rather than classic  --  example of why the military and the ecclesiastical , cross and sword , so often seem just two faces of the same coin . He was n't a stern man at all , in spite of his lack of humour , which sprang much more from a diffuse absentmindedness , almost an unworldliness , than any intrinsic disapprovalof laughter . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed he was always at his most patient where some fathers might have ranted and thumped the table ; and I am sure it was not simply because I was an only child , and technically motherless . I was hardly an angel before I went to boarding school at fourteen , yet he never once used physical punishment on me . He disapproved of it , even in the village school , though he finally sent me to where the juniors were caned once a fortnight with monotonous regularity . The real tyranny came from the totally accepted belief in the system , the existing social frame . Just as a soldier can not question orders , the hierarchy of command and all the assumptions that underlie it , nor could we . One might at a pinch discreetly object to the outward manner of some other vicar from a neighbouring village , or of some high-up from clerical headquarters at Exeter , even of the bishop himself ; but not to their right to be exactly who they were . During the war , of course , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrified , which was the main reason Labour won that first election afterwards . Though quite unconsciously , and despite his being an archdemonstrator , father must have approved of Hitler for keeping progress so firmly at bay . I tried to put it all in the play I based on him ; one other parallel I made there still holds , I think , and that is the way the English turn all outward freedom ( as contrasted with that of the imagination ) into a game with set rules : one where every freedom is allowed except the freedom to break those rules . I suspect the Anglo-Saxons were a much more taboo-dominated crowd than the Celts they drove out of England . If the Romans brought civilization , the German tribes brought ritual codes , which have survived in our hideous national inventiveness over games proper , the art of wasting time according to someone else 's book . I particularly loathed team games at school  --  as I have ever since  --  though I thought at the time it was merely because they were an obvious emblem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it was one more negative way in which father and his world-outlook conditioned me . We lived very simply , though much more out of parsonical good taste than necessity . The living ( or both livings , since we also had a neighbouring parish-hamlet in our cure ) was well endowed , and my father had several hundred a year private income on top of that ; 90I and there was the money my mother had left in trust to me ; even Millie had a small income of her own . That came to seem like another hypocrisy , when I realized in later boyhood that our supposedpoverty was really mere thrift . No doubt a good deal went on charity and the upkeep of the two churches , but the former certainlydid n't begin at home in terms of birthday presents , pocketmoneyand the like . I have been careless with money ever since  --  one more item on the bill . My father had one real passion , which endeared him to the village and belatedly endeared him to me as well . That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our occasional picnics and botanize with me , he did not really approve of wild plants and nature . He drew some analogy between horticulture and God watching over a world ; in nature things happened behind your back , could not be supervised and controlled . At any rate , his own garden and his greenhouse he adored . That and the seventeenthcenturytexts he liked to browse over were his only real indulgences  --  very nearly his sin , in the case of gardening . If he could n't get cuttings of rare shrubs honestly , he was not above stealing them , with a mixture of blatant casualness and ill-concealed guilt that was delicious . He always carried an umbrella , on even the most unlikely days , to hide his ill-gotten Irishman 's heels and seedlings in . It was one of the few things Aunt Millie and I were allowed to tease him over ; and assumed monstrous proportions when one day one of his victims happened to be in our garden and spotted a successful scion of some precious rarity from his own . Father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was n't allowed to forget it . All my most a$ectionate memories are of him standing in his greenhouse , wearing the ancient and faintly episcopal purple baize butler 's apron he used for gardening . Sometimes , in hot weather , he would take off his dog-collar and be taken by some unsuspecting stranger for the full-time gardener we did not actually permit ourselves . As an adolescent I got bored with all this side of his life , I wanted to read books and roam the countryside during my holidays , but when I was younger I used to help him pot and all the rest . He bred carnations and primulas especially ; used to exhibit , before the war , and judged shows to the end . If we were short of humour and9Tseveral other kinds of light in that house , there were always flowers , a feeling that the large garden was a part of the family . It seems absurd now . A small boy rushing in to breakfast : TheOsnianthus is out ! The Clematis armandii ! The Trichodendron ' Theywere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dogs and cats , loved and very familiar . There was a walled kitchen-garden as well , but father had no interest in vegetables . Thrift was abandoned enough to allow a man to come in twice a week to look after them . His prides there were the fruit-trees , the apples and pears some previousincumbent had gone in for and my father added to ; old gridded espaliers and gnarled cordons , their fruiting-spurs as brittle as charcoal . I suppose people still grow them , Jargonelle and Glou Morceau , Musk Bergamot and Good Christian ; the russets and pippins and wardens and codlings and nameless ones  --  Aunt Millie 's Tree , the Yellow Devil ( because it used to rot in the apple-loft ) , the Green Spice . I knew them as other little boys knew county cricketers and football teams . And I owe him other poetries , quite literal , though like so many true gifts from parents to children , they took many years to mature . When I was a child he liked , or at any rate regarded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bedtime , if his duties allowed . Sometimes , as I grew older ( though not nearly old enough ) he would read a simpler passage from one of his seventeenth-century texts  --  I think more for the sound of the English than for the religious content , although he may have hoped for some Coue-like benefit . Occasionallyhe would try to explain the doctrinal situation behind one of these passages in terms a small boy might understand , as a less abstruse father might have tried to convey the real history of cowboysand Red Indians . I certainly grew up with a vision of some very confused theological gun-slinging , and a distinct sense that the Church had once been a much more exciting place to inhabit . I can see now he always wished I was older ; it was as if he foresaw that when the nine-year-old he read to became the nineteen he secretly dreamt him to be , such conversation would be impossible : I should have escaped him . But I must n't make him too austere and unworldly . He very rarely returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found time for an hour or two in the antiquarianbookshops , without something for me : it was usually a92story by one of the boy 's writers of his own childhood , a Henty or a Talbot Baines Reed , and I would much rather have had the latest Biggles or a Beano Annual , but I still enjoyed them . Once he handed me , after one of these expeditions , a book of fables . The price he bought it for is still on the fly-leaf : one shilling and sixpence . He had obviously glanced at it , decided the English was suitably simple and edifying , and the pictures pretty and harmless . I thought the queer little uncoloured prints terribly dull ; at first glance , a really measly present . But in fact it was a Bewick , the 1820 anthology of his work patched together round Gay 's Fables . Though I did n't realize it then , it was my first contact with a great English original . At the time ( I was ten ) I thought the book acrous and shameful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages for the pictures I came on one I knew he could n't have noticed in the shop : the famous cut of a doctor of divinity spurning the solicitation of a one-legged beggar , while behind him a dog pisses down his gown  --  a little moral tale whose concise brilliance I was to remember all through my childhood ... and beyond . Then there were other scandalous scenes of ladies with bare breasts . I was shocked particularly  --  and then fascinated  --  by the one that was headed Indolence and Sloth : the sleeping young man with the jordan under his bed and the two women , one naked and the other clothed , beside it , seeming to discuss something as they watched him . I was tempted to show this gross lapse of caution to Aunt Millie , but did n't , in case my father promptly descended on the book and confiscated it . Just how great and quintessentially English an artist Bewick is I still have to learn each time I look at him ; but at least the small boy came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own nature . He began a little , through the years , to see with Bcwick 's eyes , as he was later to see with John Clare 's and Palmer 's ... and Thoreau 's . That dog-eared copy of the Select Fables is now the last book I would ever sell . A somewhat similar thing was to happen two or three years later , when I was in the throes of first puberty . One wet day , in despair , I pulled down a dull-looking book from an upper shelf in my father 's study . It was the first volume of Herrick 's Hesperides ; by benign chance the page fell open at one of his coarsest epigrams and93I saw a word in print , fart , I had hitherto imagined was something one only giggled over , out of reach of adult ears , at school . Up it my room I read on . Much of it I could n't understand , but the mingled brutality and eroticism of what I could was a revelation 1 was to purloin those two volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound influence  --  the secrecy with which I had to steal them , rearranging the books so that no empt1 space showed , then hiding then in my room ... but , with a healthier secrecy , their lyrical genius , and Herrick 's underlying pagan human . ity , also seeped into me . His former lothed ' living at Dean Prioi was within cycling distance of us , and I must have been one of the youngest votaries who has ever stood before his epitaph there though I think it was less out of gratitude than sheer disbelief . How could someone of my father 's calling ever have existed and beer allowed to write such wicked verse ? Later , at Oxford , I had one day to produce an essay on Herrick for my tutor . I was n't so foolish as to make it quite autobiographical but it did make an engaging minor poet out to be a pinnacle of human sanity and supreme exponent of love of life  --  he was my Rabelais , of course . Very interesting , Mr Martin , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now perhaps next week you would be kind enough to write me an essay on Herrick . ' The snug : was deserved ; but I was dealing with someone who had only read the man ... not lived him . My father did do some censoring . Another bedtime book he read from was the Jacobean collection , The Shirburn Ballads . It was not until he died and I was going through his library before the great bulk of it was sent for sale that I discovered the Shirburn is not just an anthology of hymn-tunes ; the religious ballads were the only ones he ever read to me , to my recollection . I had already been set at literal Latin and Greek at my prep school , and my father read English verse with the emphatic stress of his own classical schooldays . He particularly liked the broadsheets in the rhythm of the amphimacer , which indulged this love of a heavy beat  --  we would even get them at Sunday School occasionally . he would stand there , waving his free hand like a would-be conductor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stifle their giggles ... how could he make such an ass of me with his stupid poem-reading ? But now , at least94to their bedtime renderings , they arc among my good memories of him . All that heart can conceive , ear can hear , eye can sec , All , and more , I possess , sweet JESU CHRIST , by thee . Heaven and earth , all therein , Life , limb , thou gayest me . Have I not cause to singJesu , come thou to rare . Though the world tempt me sore , though the flesh trouble me , Though the Devil would devour , my refuge is in thee ... It was not to be . But I think if it ever had , it might have come more fhoin that private voice ; its endless long  --  short  --  long , the due pause it gave every caesura , those little rocking boats of primitive faith. e used to send me to sleep with them sometimes ; but to the best of sleeps . Our 19305 were not like the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but endlessly leafy , sunlit , ancient-walled , secure , spaced by bells ; all smell of mown grass and islanded from towns . The only real shadow lay beyond the iron gate that led through into the churchyard . My unknown mother 's grave ; but even that seemed mainly protective , quietly watching . Each autumn we planted her two favourite primroses round the border : Quaker 's Delight and the wild oxlip , the true plant from East Anglia , not the primrosecowslipcross . My father had a clerical friend there who used to send iced especially . By late April the grave was always a quilt of lilac clusters and tall pale-yellow heads ; after Sunday matins , people would stroll down the path to admire it . The war came , and puberty for me , and a much darker chapter ; so dark that for years I let the earlier days stay buried . I began having serious religious doubts after a year at public school . It was only partly that I lacked the courage ( nothing conforms like a dormitory of small boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-95ground . The boredom I had felt in secret for years , the endless , end- less , endless round of hymns , prayers , collects , psalms , the same faces , the same voices , the same corpus of beliefs and routines that did n't seem to tie in at all with reality , all that was now translated to a world where to express one 's boredom with chapel was the done thing , not the forbidden . Small boys ' arguments for atheism may not have much logic or cogency ; but they came much fresher and ( though I knew how to cover up , even then ) more attractively to me than to the others . So too did the pleasures of sexuality ; I fell into that , from the profoundly sexless and emotion-banning am- bience of the Vicarage , like Adam himself . I had agonizing feelings of shame and guilt , of course , and masturbation and blasphemy became inextricably interwoven . Every indulgence in the one threatened the traditional punishment of the other ... heavens open- ing , thunderbolts raining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember talking about all this with Anthony years afterwards at Oxford , and his smiling and saying that to derive disbelief from a failure to punish was almost as bad as deriving belief from a cer- tainty of grace . I was never in danger of the worse sin . I discovered the unholy pleasures of gossip and malice ; they seemed honest after fifteen years of imposed charity in the discussion of other people 's faults . And I became very eager indeed to prove I was no tame vic- tim of my background ; swore and blasphemed , swopped filth with the best , after lights out . I discovered new aspects of myself ; an inventiveness , even though it most often manifested itself as a skill in lying ; a tongue , an extrovert mask . I also wanted to succeed , with a ferocity that might not have been predicted of my earlier years , and I worked hard  --  though that was partly out of guilt for so many betrayals in other matters . We also had the standard English classics at home and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to read more all through my school career . My disco- veries ( the shock of Samuel Butler , and the joy ) also increasingly sapped my respect for my father and his faith . The real severance came after an event that must wait to be told . But by the age of seventeen I was a fully-fledged atheist , so con- vinced that I went dutifully  --  if gracelessly  --  through all the old observances when I was home for the holidays . 1 went on going to 913 hutch and even taking communion from my father 's hands right up to his death in 1948 , without an iota of belief and a mounting Iota of sins . I thought it was adult to deceive the old man so , I l , ought it was mainly condescension ... and kindness a little . He haded up to the fact , before I left school , that I was not going to keep up the family tradition ; and at least outwardly , taken it with a o , igned equanimity . But I think he secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lacked the heart to destroy that last illusion . I even managed , dimly , to begin the reconciliation with my rural background . School , other minds and other places , to say nothing of the growing aestheticism of my view of life , at least allowed me to see that it had its charms , even though it still  --  and for many years to come  --  had to be presented to one 's friends as so much unspeakable drag . The lovely rich peace of the countryside , the calm of the Vicarage , its fine garden ... even our two churches . I had the ghastly Late Victorian architecture of the chapel at school to put them . by now ; and began to see them as connoisseurs of Devon churches have always seen them : for as good a pair  --  even without their celebrated roodscreens and splendid fifteenth-century painted rows of Apostles and Elders  --  as any in the county . The one beside the Vicarage had a massive fluted and streamlined tower soaring ( the simile conies from later times ) like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and light inside , thanks to its huge Tudor windows ; then the churchyard beyond , the two elms and the yew , and Dartmoor in the distance . It also held my favourite religious pin-up , who had somehow managed to gatecrash the more orthodox assembly on the roodscreen , the pagan figure of the Cumaean Sibyl . My father always pointed her out to visitors , to show his broadmindedness  --  and show off his ability to quote from the I. ( north Eclogue . Our second church was smaller , its tower sitting like a barn-owl iu the green dusk of its long-deserted combe . All its old box-pews were still in existence , and it had a womb-like peace , a domesticity , r femaleness , and we all secretly preferred it to the grander building nearer home . Curiously , it always attracted good congregations , in spite of its inaccessibility ; people would come from far and wide in the area , even during the war . One church was magnificent stone prose , but the other a folk-poem . I shall never rate consecratedn.tvt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would rather lie ... and it is not , alas , beside my parents . And finally there was Aunt Millie . She was a thin , small woman , in retrospect always with somethingfaintly ( and quite misleadingly ) of the Radclyffe Hall era o lesbianism about her  --  perhaps it was just that she always had her straight grey hair cut in a kind of Eton crop , invariably wore ' sensible ' clothes and brogue-like shoes , had no apparent feminine vanitiesat all . Nothing , in reality , could have been less butch than her placid composure . Her one small vice was smoking , and that and the severe hair and the glasses could give her face a semblance of intellectuality , as if she were hiding another personality . In fact I realized during my adolescence that she was very nearly simpleminded , quite at sea with any print outside Good Housekeeping and the parish magazine  --  and the local newspaper , of which she read every line , and every week . If I could with some reason curse my father for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some sort of choice to be imaginable  --  it was impossible with Millie . Her one skill was thinking the best of everyone and everythingwithin her domaine of knowledge . If my father had been the commandant of a concentration camp , she would have come to see the necessity of genocide  --  but not out of evil ... out of a total lack of belief in her own ability to judge . Her real religion was not in church , but in her view of other people 's motives , of the import of village scandals and tragedies . She had a phrase she would use to conclude discussion of all but irremediable disaster : Perhaps it 's for the best . Even my father would look gently over his spectacles at her before some such applications of this optimism . Once , when we were alone , and she had said it of something that even Dr Pangloss could have seen was for the worst , I laughed at her . And she said quietly , Hoping is no sin , Daniel . ' I harried her abominably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my budding literary enthusiasms if only she 'd try , she could move with the times a little more , cider-cup was not the end of the world at a tennis-party ... poor woman , it was n't fair at all . She was much nearer sainthood than anyone else in my life  --  the kind of sanctity Flaubert defined for all time in Un Coeur Simple . I did n't read that masterpiece until she was dead ; and recognizedper , and my own past arrogance , at once . She was still alive , living with my other aunt , her married sister in Cumberland , when the divorce with Nell took place . She wrote me a long rambling letter IhIat tried to understand what had happened , tried very hard not to I , I.une me , but significantly did not try to pretend that perhaps it was for the best , though she did end , the dear old fool , by pressing Inc to go out to one of the colonies ' and start a new life ' . I had passed several light-years beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That outreached all time and space . I disowned all this world for so long simply because I saw it as c ; tkishly abnormal . But I see it now as no more than an extreme : Imple of the general case . My contemporaries were all broughtul in some degree of the nineteenth century , since the twentieth did 11 It begin till 1945 . That is why we are on the rack , forced into one i ) f the longest and most abrupt cultural stretches in the history of mankind . Already what I was before the Second World War seems tar more than four decades away ; much more like the same number of centuries . And then what we once were is now severed in a very special way from the present  --  reduced to an object , an artifice , an antique , a flashback ... something discontinuous , and disconnected from presentbeing . My generation wanted to shed unnecessary guilt , irrationalrespect , emotional dependence ; but the process has become altogether too much like sterilization .

All pasts shall be coeval , a backworld uniformly not present , relegated to the status of so many family snapshots . The mode of recollection usurps the reality of the recalled . Under the tyranny of the eye , that glutton for frontiers , this is the prime alienation of the cinema ; always inherent in the theatre , yet obscured there because of different performances and productions of the same text . But the final cut allows no choice , no more than the one angle ; no creative response , no walking round , no time for one 's own thought . In the very act of creating its own past , the past of the scenario and the past of the shooting , it destroys the past of the mind of each spectator . Squinty Four-eyes in Sunday School .

IO2Gratuitous Act1 he now of then is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , the beginning of the world where winter is real . an sets his watch to Eastern Standard time . I doubt if that bed-sitter scene in the Oxford of 1950 sounds edible now ; the sin and seriousness of it . It remains the most wful , in Dr Johnson 's sense , and the most strange coupling of my celibate life . It must also , I suspect , have been one of the most awful in the more ordinary sense . I can not remember the details of the act itself at all , beyond the realization that Jane was not as adept ss her sister . ' With Nell there was already flirtations with perversity  --  or what passed as perversity in those days  --  and we had become by dint of practice quite skilled in sex-manual terms . With Jane there was a physical naivety , a surprising innocence ; she was passive , cc the boats were burnt . ' We got under the bedclothes , and Issessed her , and I do n't think it lasted very long . I remember thosemutes far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their impossibility-actuality , their inextricable association with the woman in the reeds ; above all , for their saying , once the strange geometric hinges had opened , that certain returns to innotrncewere now for ever banned . We seemed to take a step ( that whole first post-war period , sated with the sound of marching , was obsessed with private step-taking ) not into darkness so much as uniqueness ; no one could ever have done this before , no other age could have had our emancipation , our eagerness to experiment . Perhapsit was really our first step into the twentieth century . I think of Jenny , her simplicity and careless grace , the way she slips out of clothes into nakedness , into sexuality , as easily as a seal into water . The fuss of those days , the multiple guilts and ignorances ... Rabelais has won with a vengeance now ; and everything is much tamer . No uniforms and uniformity to exorcise ; no id to release ; no tense long years between puberty and the full exploration of what puberty brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much had to103be sublimated for so long that at least we acquired the rudiments of a genuine culture . Jane and I were five years younger than our children , at the equivalent age , in terms of sexual pre ( ocity and its physical and linguistic expression ; but five years older in most other things . That is one more chasm . Our surrender to existentialism and each other was also , of course , fraught with evil . It defiled the printed text of life ; broke codes with a vengeance ; and it gave Dan a fatal taste for adultery , for seducing , for playing Jane 's part that day . It might seem good , as great yet immoral art can be good ; good in sacrificing all to self ; but we did n't realize the non-exchangeability of life and art . In reality that day Dan did not understand what was happening ; that as he had been led in , so must he be led out . They lay clasped afterwards , in a state of delayed shock , far more Candide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their backs , side by side and hand-in-hand , and stared at the ceiling . Dan said , What are we going to do ? ' She pressed his hand . Nothing . ' We ca n't ... ' but he did not finish the sentence . After a silence she said , I do love Anthony . And Nell loves you . ' But we love each other . ' Again she pressed his hand . We could have loved each other . ' Their fingers were interlaced , and he squeezed . We ca n't pretend this has n't happened . ' We must . ' But it would be such a lie . Such a ... ' In parenthesis . ' He was silent . He wanted to look at her , but could not ; could only stare at the ceiling above . She said , Our secret . They must n't ever know . ' It 's like living with dynamite . ' ' That s why it had to be exploded . I 've been terrified Nell will see . ' For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten what she had said on the river : about the real and bathetic future that faced them . It 's not fair . ' 104 Again there was a silence . Then she said , When we came back hcre , I arrived at a sott of decision . That I 'd let you make love to me ( you wanted . But if that happened , I would marry Anthony ... as a Catholic . ' He did look at her then . But that 's mad . ' He sought for words . In those terms , you'vejust committed a mortal sin . ' For which I must now do penance . ' She had a small smile , but she held his eyes , and he knew it was not being said lightly . She added , And you . ' All our lives ? ' May I have a cigarette ? ' He turned and reached for them and lit two , then passed her one . She sat up , out of the bedclothes , and he put his arm round her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should never feel guilt about this . Ever . ' But you 've just said we must do penance . ' I 'm sorry , I know it 's not logical . I 'm not ashamed of having wanted you . But I would be if I could n't stop . If wanting you became more important than hurting Nell and Anthony . ' You did n't even enjoy it very much . ' I did . It was just how I imagined . ' He said , Okay for a rehearsal . ' She pressed her head back against his and ran a hand down his thigh beneath the bedclothes , then pinched the skin gently . He lifted a hand and cupped the small breasts together , then moved it up to turn her face and boby . But they had hardly begun to kiss  --  and Dan to feel , though he was never to know , that everything was still in the balance  --  when there was the sound of the front door being slammed below . Dan had locked that of his own room  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels as if a figure might burst through them , like a shape in a movie cartoon . It flashed through his mind that it might be Nell , after all ; and she would wait until Lenin 's widow returned home and ask her to let her in ... Never so frightened , before or since : but the footsteps were too fast and heavy . They did stop outside the door , and knock , then try the handle : then accepted defeat and went on upstairs . The two inre'sthe bed heard the steps cross the ceiling , from the room above . I was Barney Dillon , the student who lived upstairs . Jane turned and put her arms round Dan and gave him one quick wild kiss ; pushed away , stared him in the eyes for a long moment Then she was out of bed , dressing ; and he the same . They straigh- tened the bedclothes , all in a fevered silence . From upstairs there was the sound of a radio , the faint beat of music ; more footsteps . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved and still frightened . It could have been Nell ; and it could still be Nell . He also felt already defeated , deceived , almost as if Jane had conspired to bring this interruption . She was brushing her hair , intent on her face in one o his mirrors . Then she was holding out her hands and taking his . I must go . In case he comes down . ' But  --  ' Dan . ' I 'm never going to be able to hide it . ' You must . ' There 's so much we have n't said . ' And could n't ever . It does n't matter . ' She kissed him again ; and again was the one who broke it off . She stood for a moment with her head buried against his neck . Then she said , Please see if the coast 's clear . ' He cautiously unlocked the door . They tiptoed downstairs , Jane with her shoes in her hand . She slipped them on at the front door , while he looked out down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated , then looked down from his face . ' I ' 11 go round and see Nell later . ' Nell 's and her own cottage were very close . She added , Unless you want to . ' He shook his head . By which he really meant , I do n't know how you ... though he saw the necessity . She raised her eyes and met his . If I can help it now , it 's because I could n't before . Do you understand that ? ' He said nothing , he was still trying to understand . But in the end he nodded . Her eyes were strange , they had almost a despair , a searching for something he could not give . She leant forward , kissed him impulsively on the mouth . The next moment she was slipping quickly out of the door . He closed it , and remained staringI06a moment at the latch ; trying to imagine what he had barred from his future , what punishment this crime would exact ; his own dissociatedhand on the final lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . When he went back to his own room , he shut the door loudly , so that it could be heard upstairs , if Barney was listening . Everything there seemed inalienably changed , strange to him ; most of all , his own face in his mirrors ; yet suddenly he felt a strange amusement , he even smiled at himself . After all , it was fantastic , incredible , really rather marvellous ; terribly avant-garde and adult ; and left nothing , for it was so like Jane to be so intense and dramatic about the future , definitely decided . It had happened , that was the essential ; and all kinds of buried feelings of inferiority towards Anthony lay mysteriouslybut profoundly alleviated . Once more Dan had begun to write himself . And so well that he found , after ten minutes or so , as if for a first test , the poise , the chutzpah , to go up and see Barney Dillon . I07ReturnsI had an hour to wait at Kennedy for my flight to London . I ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was in New York , about the Kitchener script . But I felt too tired , too remote from the present . So I gave myself the prospect of one more transatlantic call about nothing , and sat in the departure-lounge bar . The surfer surrendered to the wave , indifferent to what happened for as long as the journey lasted ; something in me wished it would last for ever . Again , Jenny , in that simile I had not yet read  --  and which indeed she had n't yet written  --  was halfway right . I did feel like a suitcase with illegible labels , safe for as long as I was locked . I managed one practical thing between the whisky sours . Not trusting her mother , I sent a cable to Caro saying I was on my way . Caroline at least had become a less menacing fault , in both the geological and the self-blaming sense , in my life . For so many years she had n't seemed my daughter  --  merely something I had once given Nell and was ungraciously allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted our brief encounters . Nell had conditionedher to see me as the rat ; and on my side I saw far too much of the mother in the child . She even took after her mother physically , though not mentally  --  not that that was unmixed consolation . If she lacked Nell 's sharp tongue , she also seemed to lack every other kind of intellectual acuity . The country world she had followed Nell into when she re-married , the riding , the wretched boardingschoolfor upper-class fools she had been sent to ( Nell 's choice , my expense ) ... none of that helped . Through her teens I tried , too hard , to inject some culture , some rudimentary awareness that not all human decency resided in the rural-Tory view of life . But she seemed impervious , or just embarrassed . Then two years before Nell and I had had to face the problem of a career for her . There was no chance of her getting into the most indulgent university . She did n't want to go abroad . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little rich girls in Kensington . IOHI began to sec a great deal more of her then ; and at long last discoveredsomeone I could like , under the veneer of debby silliness . There was an embryonic independence , in which , vainly , I saw my own genes at work ; an affectionateness , and a narked new attitude towards me . I learnt more about Nell and Andrew and her hitherto shrouded life at Compton . She was no cat , and it was largely reading between the lines . But it was clear that living in London , even though it was in a hostel run like a prison-camp , had woken her up to the fact that she 'd been partly brain-washed at home ; and especiallyover me . We had a long-delayed little father-daughter affaire , in short . I was allowed to tease her out of some of her follies and she teased me out of some of mine . She had boyfriends , there was nothing unhealthy about it . One day she spontaneously brought up the absurdity of our meetings when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kept laughing , remembering yet one more ghastly weekend or afternoon . It was marvellous : like seeing a capsizedboat right itself , and knowing that no serious damage had been done  --  that in a way there was almost an advantage in the long being capsized . That previous summer she had finished her course and after a holiday , got herself a job . She had had a choice of several and took the one I advised with ... let 's call it the Sunday Timeserver . The others were all in the City and I preferred her to do something with more human interest than share-prices and learning business jargon . She had no writing ability at all , but life  --  however humble  --  on a big newspaper seemed less likely to bore her . There was by then a more permanent young man . I knew they were going to bed together and that marriage was likely one day ; so it was just a matter of keeping her occupied and getting her some experience of life outside Gloucestershire and Kensington . She fancied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over mine while I was in California . It was the flat in . Notting Hill Nell and I had graduated to at the end of our marriage ; old-fashioned , but large , and on a 99-year lease . It seemed silly not to use it . So Caro moved in , and a month or two later I moved out . She did n't write very often , but when she did she kept up a pretence of awfulness at not having found anywhere else to live : a pretence that hurt . It defined much that remained not quite natural in our relationship . It was the same with money , over109which she was careful ( a virtue she must have picked up from her stepfather ) . She had refused to let inc continue her allowance when she started work , on all sorts of excellent grounds ( the ' fortune ' I had already had to fork out ' on her education , and so on ) , yet I felt frustrated . Jenny was quite right : I did complain far more about these minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other . The thought of soon seeing her again was a genuine pleasure , though it was accompanied by an equally genuine guilt , since I had stayed a good deal longer than I originally intended in America . I knew Caro must know why . Jenny had been mentioned once or twice in my letters , but not the full extent of the relationship . News of that must have reached her by now , and I anticipated a trace of jealousy . She had n't written at all for the last three weeks . On the other hand she was her own mistress now , and in a much more open world , and I counted on the ill wind at Oxford that blew me home to help us together again . The flight was called . I boarded and promptly spread myself over three seats . But I could see it was going to be mercifully uncrowded  --  we were due in London at z a.m. , not when the wise normally arrive . I tried to decide which I wanted most : the meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat waiting for the take-off All my adult life I have believed that nothing controls our desti- Hies beyond our genes and external events . The manifold ways so many Californians try to escape from rational causation  --  the dotty religions , the chasing after Gurdjieff , Ouspensky , any crank , the fifty thousand therapy centres and deep-meditation ranches , the astrology , the mania for ESP and drug mysticism ... all that had never provoked anything in inc but contempt or a laugh . I had already been badly shaken that previous evening ; and now the god of coincidence decided to kick me while I was down . A last passenger came into the cabin . I glanced towards the aisle as he passed , and he down towards inc . He had run to fat a little , was balding fast , but still that same vaguely louche , vaguely quiz- zical smile  --  though for the tiniest beat the face wished , too late , that it had n't looked down and seen inc . Only the surprise was genuine , and on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttered his hand quickly acrossIIO his face , and said what I had said a few hours previously . Ghosts . ' And I finally knew that day in Oxford did not want to die . At the time one was proud to introduce him , despite the lop-sided smile , always probing , like a leech , for exposed skin . Dillon the wit , the gossip , a pillar of Isis : in those days publicity was myrrh and frankincense , and Barney could dispense it . He was another of the mature ones , though in a very different way from Anthony ; already in Fleet Street , already on the as yet unforeseen television screen , charming to the unknown and needle-sharp with the innuendoin the back of the known . Even then he had the knack of world-weary authority in his film and theatre reviews , of elaborate malice in his gossip column , of pathological egocentricity convincinglypassed off as solid honesty in his more serious pieces . He was an amusing mimic , too . Dan found him stretched on his bed . Barney also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan from his book , playing the spy . Sell you a pass for a fiver ? ' Daniel grinned ; held his line . I 'll sell you a scoop for nothing . ' I buy it in cubes , mate . Not granulated . ' Seriously , Barney . Something fantastic ... butfan-tastic . ' Dillon stared at him ; then smiled cautiously . So give . ' A week later , this appeared in his gossip column : We have it straight from the hearse 's mouth that one of our budding Ben Jonsons is peeved beyond words  --  a merciful release , some may think ( not us , we like the lad ) . Seems he was absent-mindedly propelling the wrong Heavenly Twin recently down a retired backwater when ... okay , so you read the papers too . Why the peeve ? The said backwater has a certain reputation , my friends , and has told more than one Nell in its thyme . The unfortunate pair claim they were there for a quiet read .

IIIIt ' vas not the tone that offended I ) . iii when he lead it , but the brevity . And now I was standing , a quarter of a century later , and taking his hand . Barney . Long time . ' Incredible . 1 was talking about you only yesterday . ' He shook his head , full of some bewilderment he could n't communicate , but wanted me to know he felt . He had a briefcase , a mac over one arm ; a rather ostentatiously up-to-the-moment suit , studiously informal , an open-necked shirt . He said , With Caroline . ' He must have seen I was nonplussed . On the blower . Has n't she told you ? ' Told me what ? ' She 's my secretary now . As of three weeks ago . ' But I thought you 'd left ... ' A stewardess came up and smiled at him . She evidently knew who he was . We 're winding up the elastic . If you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll fucking well report you . ' He transferred his grin at her to ine . She knows I 'm the all-time air coward . Super to see you , Dan . Just let me dump my stuff . I 'll explain . ' I watched him go down the plane and find an empty row of seats . The same stewardess hovered round him , and there was more badinage . If he had n't slept with her , he apparently wanted to suggest it . I noticed an English couple across the gangway ; they also knew who he was , must have seen him on television . There had been a period after Oxford when we had kept in fairly frequent touch ... occasional dinners , parties , first nights . I was writing plays , and he was reviewing . He was very friendly about the first two plays , and did an almost gushing profile of me for a theatre magazine soon afterwards . Then for a time he moved to other fields , and we drifted apart . But he was back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the break-up of my marriage , came on in London . He very comprehensively panned it . To give him his due , he delivered warning privately that I was about to be slaughtered ; and made some sort of apology for having to dorighis duty ... and it was poorly reviewed elsewhere . I did n't resent the technical side of his attack , I knew I had made a mess of things there ; but I did resent his use of private information , the references to ' unassimilatedpersonal experience ' and the rest . It did n't matter , at the time , that he was quite right ; I felt , if not an old friendship , then at least an old acquaintance had been betrayed , and I decided to cross him off my list of people I wanted to know . In the nature of our two lapping worlds , we had met occasionally from time to time since . He had also done some film reviewing , and I could n't complainof unfair treatment when our paths had crossed in that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Barney , in fact , than that lie was a critic . No creator can like critics . There is too much difference between the two activities . One is begetting , the other surgery . However justified the criticism , it is always indictedby someone who has n't , a eunuch , on someone who has , a generator ; by someone who takes no real risks on someone who stakes most of his being , economic as well as immortal . I certainly could not call Barney a failure in wordly terms ; yet something of that also hung about him  --  indeed has continued to hang around all my Oxford generation . As with Ken Tynan , so many others , I certainly ca n't except myself , destiny then pointed to far higher places than the ones actually achieved . Perhaps we were too self-conscious , too aware of one another and what was expected of us , too scared of seeming pretentious ; and then , in the 1950s , we were fatally undercut and isolated by the whole working-class , antiuniversityshift in the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look Back in Anger was also a kind of epitaph over our hopes and ambitions  --  over the framework of middle-class tradition and culture that we had all been willy-nilly confined in . All this reduced us to watching and bitching ; to satire ; to climbing on whatever cultural or professional bandwagon came to hand , accepting the fool 's gold of instant success . That is why so many became journalists , critics , media men , producers and directors ; grew so scared of their pasts and their social class , and never recovered . Barney himself had over the last decade become more and more of a television personality , latterly on a chat show of his own . I had even seen it once or twice . He was a little too concerned for hisH3own image ; tried to trade one-liners vitli a professional comic interrupted too much with a well-known politician . As with al camera-conscious performers on that merciless medium , lie finall ) made one wonder what he was trying to hide , why he could n't be himself . This particular show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money as well , obviously  --  but watching it , I had not beer able to help remembering the old Barney and his cynicism . He hac had higher standards once ; and the one thing he had never been , ir the Oxford days , was unnecessarily nice to the famous . Probably he would have said that he had matured ... but gadflies do n't mature ; they simply die . One of his shows I had turned off halfway through , Whatever anger I had once felt about the review had given way to a boredom with the hollow shell he , as minor emblem of all out generation , had seemed to have become . And now the hollow shell came and sat beside me , and fastened his seat-belt . We were on camera . The couple opposite kept sneakinglooks across . I 've ordered Scotch . Yes ? ' Fine . Tell me about Caro . I thought you 'd left the paper . ' We pissed and made up . ' He shrugged . Just a new column . Keep my hand in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bloody famous now . I can remember the days when I was lucky to get the corner of a table . Now it 's an office and secretary . ' Is she any good ? ' Splendid . Taken to it like a duck to water . ' I 'm glad . ' Holds the fort and all that . Bosses me about . Even learning to spell . ' I smiled . She 's sensational . Really . ' He seemed very eager to be nice . But my mind was already reaching ahead to Caro . Though I could n't recall ever having talked of Barney to her , perhaps Nell had , and I wondered for a moment if she had known , or half guessed , that he was not someone I liked the thought of her having to work for ; whether there was n't a little element of revenge for my infidelity with Jenny . We began to taxi . I asked what had brought him over to the States . Piece on the elections . Usual crap . ' He screwed up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They just never seem to grow up . You must find that ? ' ' Sometimes . ' ' Of course , on the Coast ... ' he shrugged , then probed . I thought you were doing a script out there . ' I 'm coming back to see Anthony Mallory , Barney . Caro 's ... ? ' Yes , she told me . Bloody awful . ' He paused . I thought  --  ' He broke off , then smiled . Sorry , not my business . ' he obviously thought what Caro must have told him : that Anthony and I had n't communicated for years . I explained the tuation , and we talked about Anthony , and cancer , for a little while . Oh well , be a nice surprise for Caro . You have a very admiring daughter . You know that ? ' He squeezed his nose . Actually , Dan , before I forget , she asked me to give you a ring . Send you her love . utd tell you about the new job . I 've been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and had to cram fifty-nine  --  ' That 's okay . I 'll tell her . ' We waited for take-off , at the runway end . The engines roared up in test , and lie was silent a moment . He gave a little puff of sclf-I nuscment . ' Jesus , I hate this form of locomotion . ' Intimations of mortality ? ' Is it all worthwhile , I ask myself . ' Come on . We 've survived . ' Oh sure . In five thousand pages of fish-and-chip wrapping . ' Balls . ' He stared bleakly down the cabin , then pulled his mouth to one side and shrugged . When I look back . ' From the top of your profession ? ' Big deal . As they say . ' We began to run . Actually I 've been here about a TV show as well . They have a crazy idea I might be the new David Frost . I told them , I do n't even want to be the old David Frost . ' I duly grinned .

At least it was nice to be h ck where underton were not missed . You try over here . There 's not much conmlpetition . ' I stared out at Manhattan rising in the distance ; the termii towers . He loosened his scat-belt . Caroline tells me you 're on an epic . ' Hardly . Historical . Kitchener . ' I said , And doomed before starts . ' Yes ? ' We 're off the record , Barney . ' Of course , dear boy . Just curious . ' The stewardess came with our whiskies . Barney gave her a smil and a Bless you ' . We talked movie business for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He sat listening , staring down at his glas5 swilling the ice-cubes round , unnaturally deferential ; as if he woul ( rather be chatting up the stewardess . Then he began to talk again about television , its ephemerality , the stupefying quantity of horse shit ' his own programmes involved . It was a trauma , or ordeal , I hac long been through myself  --  the tyranny of the mass audience , the need to suppress instinct , education , subtlety and a dozen otlic things in favour of the bedrock truth of the human condition : tha the majority is ignorant and wants , or at least pays money , to be treated as a moron . Audiences are shmucks , as a celebrated oh Hollywood director once put it succinctly to me , and shmucks hat ( brains . Then Barney went on about the horrors of now bein  --  recognized everywhere he went ; but no one walks into that blind All art , from the finest poetry to the sleaziest strip-show , has the same clause written in  --  you will henceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entails . Still , I felt some sympathy fon him ; and a certain wry amusement , at finding myself in Jenny 's role now . Perhaps he sensed it . We had a couple more whiskies , and lx raised his glass . Well , here 's to Caroline , anyway . ' He drank , then said , ' Shc seems to have survived the divorce pretty well . ' By some miracle . It 's been nice getting to know her this last couple of years . ' You probably did n't miss much . Speaking from bitter personal experience . ' I16I 've forgotten ... ' Three boys . The oldest wo n't speak to ine , the middle one ca n't , . uid the youngest does . He 's the one I hate . ' I Ie 'd said that before , no doubt in El Vino 's . And beyond the epigram ?

' I tried to remember Margaret ; a small woman with a smile that i led too hard , and who said nothing unless spoken to ; never seemed i1uite to want to be where she was . She had n't been at Oxford , and I knew very little about her . Barney stared again down the cabin . Roll on the Republic . Let omne other poor bastard bring the little horrors up . ' I 'm sorry . ' My fault . Never enough time . Or the patience . ' He took a breath , and another mouthful of whisky , then changed the subject . ' You 're coming back here as soon as ... ? ' ' No , I 'll finish the script at home . ' He gave me one of his old smiles : knowing and searching . Is it really home for you now ? ' England ? Good lord , yes . I 've got a small farm down in Devon . ' Caroline told me . Sounds nice . ' ' We drifted then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shared : doubts and disillusions , grasped-for apples turned to wax , dreams become ashes . But I would never have come out with that to him . You can practise self-deprecation and get away with it with those you love ; but not with those you despise . I decided he was anxious that I should n't say too much about the past to Caro . He too wanted a favourable report : he had problems , he did n't take himself too seriously . They started bringing round the meal and I used that , my not having slept and not feeling hungry , to break off the conversation . Ile was very anxious we should have lunch one day soon if I was in London . I made the right noises . Then I lay down . Sleep came deep and dreamless , like all slumbers of the damned . II7Tarquini iThey had one golden period . Anthony heard of an empty flat in Rome and the four of them spent six weeks in it during the high summer of the year that followed their last as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the academic sense . Anthony was now teaching at Worcester and Dan was stage-managing at the Playhouse ; on a pittance , and really living on the eight hundred a year he had inherited . Anthony and Jane had married in December . She was four months pregnant by the time they went to Rome . Their wedding had been formal and formidable , with a full panoply of relatives ; Dan was best man . Jane had been officially received into the Church a month previously . In the new year they moved into a cottage at Wytham . Dan and Nell had had a much simpler registry-office ceremony as soon as Nell had taken her Finals , and Rome was their token honeymoon . A year before Dan would not have believed it possible that he could go through with such an arrangement . But much had changed in the interval . He would have liked not to see Jane for weeks after their acte gratuit . But that very next afternoon he was working in his room when she appeared with Anthony . It happened so fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to dread the meeting . Their names as the discoverers of the corpse ( whose murderer was never found ) were already in the morning newspapers . Anthony seemed wrily amused , wanted to hear Dan 's side of it . He had to be treated normally ... as Nell already that day had had to be treated normally . She knew he was cramming and had arrived just after breakfast on her bicycle , on her way to her first lecture . She had been easy to deceive . She showed no suspicion , merely a shocked excitement , so ghastly , so extraordinary , their idyllic little cut ... ' He found he could look at Jane without embarrassment . He even felt a belated pity for Anthony , and discovered how easy it was to pull wool over trusting eyes ; and began to condone himself . It had been a comedy , a ten minutes ' madness . He felt himself runningI18away , already devaluing the reality , even comparing Jane physically to Nell , telling himself he really preferred Nell , he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the bathroom , and they were left alone . It was a warm day , she was sitting propped on the window-sill over the garden , and Dan was lying on the bed . They said nothing and avoided each other 's eyes , and the truth behind the comedy was there . Then suddenly she swung her legs to the ground and came across to the bed . He stared up into her eyes . She said slowly , ' " If it were done ... Okay . ' Nell ? ' All right . She came round this morning . ' And he stared until she had to turn away . She put both hands on the mantelpiece and stared down at the unlit gas-fire . Are you angry with me ? ' Do you remember how that Macbeth speech ends ? ' No . ' ' " Then we 'd jump the life to come . " ' She opened her mouth to say something , then closed it . Therewas a long moment . I had quite a talk with Nell last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sarcasm , then spoke simply . You are angry . ' He put his hands behind his head and stared up at the ceiling . You seem to wish it had never happened now . ' Only if it leaves you bitter . ' So what did you and Nell decide ? I 'm good enough forher ? ' They heard Anthony outside , his voice ; and guessed that he must have bumped into the man who had the front room . They had been at Winchester together . Jane said nothing for a moment . Dan , if I stop it now , I can still be happy with Anthony . If it went on ... and Nell does want to marry you . Perhaps more than you realize . ' She gave him a little glance down from where she stood facing the mantelpiece . We 'll always be closer in one way to each other than to them . ' Iii sheer dottiness. ' " 9She smiled , then spoke more gravely . Iii what we gave up fo them . ' The door opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Darling , the poor boy wants to work . So do I. ' He hated her then . She had sounded just like Nell . The circum stances might justify her acting a bright normality , but that reminde of how well she could act tainted what had just gone before . Them she had cast herself as wisdom , self-sacrifice , already trying out fog her future role as a Catholic convert . Yet the strangest thing wa : that he felt that somewhere she did love him , understood him fai more deeply than her sister , still wanted him physically more Char . Anthony . What had happened was like an attempt to break out of myth of herself ... into that of Rabelais ; but that once proven false ; too expensive morally , she found herself now double-chained in the old one . But all this was long past by the time they went to Rome . Perhaps she contrived it  --  at any rate they were not to see each other alone again before Final Schools began . Then they had the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States to stay with their mother and stepfather . Dan was invited and could have gone , but he had already found reasons not to : lie did n't want to miss the job at the Playhouse , he had neglected Aunt Millie , he knew he was going to get a bad degree , he had an idea for a play ... all of which hid the real reason why he remained proof to all Nell 's sulks and blandishments . He felt an inherent poison in the situation by then ; an almost Jacobean claustrophobia , incest , and he knew only separationcould purge it . He did have one very brief chance to discuss it with Jane ; and she agreed , it would perhaps be better if he did n't come . After a week or so he began to miss them . He felt himself orphaned all over again , emotionally as he was literally . Aunt Millie and Cumberland  --  where she now lived with her married sister , Dan 's other aunt  --  reminded him only of what his own family could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nell were some compensation , though she teased him about dates ' and beaux ' on Cape Cod , where they were holidaying . Secretly he took offence , but that did not survive ten minutes when she came back ; ten seconds ... her arms had gone round him on the platform atu , oOxford , then her mischievous whispered voice in his ear : Where'sthe nearest bed ? From then on , what seemed like a small miracle had taken place . Banc and he tacitly avoided being left together . Sometimes he searched her eyes , when they were unobserved . She would smile gently , and look down . Nothing was to be said , the matter was eternally closed . It had something to do with her conversion , which subtly altered the relationship among all four of them . It was not that they talked about it  --  the same principle applied as with the orchid-hunting , its discussion was strictly for initiates . But over that winter something died in Jane ; more and more he saw her surrender in his room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part she did not want , or trying to reproduce in real life one she had occasionally played , the revue sex-clown . He suspected at first that her withdrawnness was also acted , overidentificationwith her new role . The commitment to Catholicism seemed continuingly absurd ; he could not see why it was necessary at all . He had never understood that part of Anthony instinctively even if he could have explained it intellectually . Perhaps there was some element of sexual jealousy , but he felt he genuinely resented this enslavement to what he saw as sophistry , an abstruse confidence trick ... to the flaw in the other man , not his virtue . On that side the most surprised , oddly enough , had been Nell . It gradually became clear that her own nature had needed Jane 's more flamboyant old self as a complement . It was almost as if she had been led by her sister into a cul-de-sac , and was now left to find her own way out . For a time , that winter , she played the spoilt child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had that frightfulMadonna face on again all evening , why have we all got so dull , honestly I do n't know her any more ... but something in Nell was eventually mollified , especially when the marriage took place and the newly-weds moved out to Wytham . Dan was always busy at the theatre in the evening and Nell went out there often to be withJane . They went furniture-hunting , things like that ; became as close , though much more privately , as when Nell had first arrived and they earned their university nickname . The Catholic thing ' was accepted , and became unimportant . Then there was Anthony 's prestige ; the handsomely achieved first , ISiIhis rapid passage into senior philosophical circles , the assurance of a fellowship as soon as he showed he could teach and fit in . It did n't alter him at all , if anything he played down his enhanced authority en famine , but it , and a happiness he could n't quite hide , did affect them also . It proved Jane 's wisdom , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan it brought twinges of career , as well ; as the other , jealousies . He did not envy academic glory , but he wanted success . A play he had secretly submitted to a London agency in December had been turned down by every management who read it . He carried that failure with him for months afterwards . Then Nell had changed . Their relationship had never had  --  or so it seemed to Dan  --  the innate rightness and conviction of Jane and Anthony 's . They understood each other , they pleased each other in bed , they liked to be seen around together . But there was always in Nell a hint of shallowness , of fickleness , an impatience . She liked amusing parties , amusing people , flirting ; what Jane had once called ogle-sprinkling . She had always used her good looks far more than her sister , to compensate for something she lacked . But Jane 's new sobriety began to affect her . She started working hard , and 4 became serious in other unexpected ways : took to playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriage became inevitable . She grew , by comparison with her former self , whatever is the female equivalent of uxorious . Dan quite liked it ; and when Jane was announced pregnant , whatever dim hankerings , or dissatisfactions , he still harboured disappeared . He finally accepted that Nell was his lot . But by then , the spring , Dan had written his fourth or fifth play , I forget now . This time he had had the sense to dramatize a world he knew as opposed to ones spun out of an inexperienced imagination ; and the sense to seek advice . By good luck one of England 's more famous and more thinking actors turned up at the Playhouse . Dan braved him with his play ; was made to rewrite several scenes , and drop one or two . But then the kind man instituted himself fairy godfather for the script in London . By May Dan knew he had taken the first essential step towards being a professional dramatist . He had signed his first contract . The Empty Church did wonders for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainingdoubts Nell may have retained about him . He even thought he122detected a faint wistfulness in Jane at the news , and he was man enough to crow inwardly at the thought of that . But in sum it was a good year for all of them , full of promise , at a time when what you are doing for yourself seems much more important than what you do to , or have done to you by , other people . None of us had ever been to Italy before  --  it was all new and amusing . We even loved the heat ; adored the ramshackle but airy old tile-floored flat ; the endless siestas and sightseeings and picnics out in the Campagna . We could n't rush about , the heat and Jane 's pregnancy prevented that . Nell and I went off on our own occasionally , but we functioned well as a foursome , seemingly better than ever before . Between Jane and myself  --  and of course in Rome we were from time to time obliged to be alone  --  there was a total silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature , to be able to pretend so convincingly that it had never happened , to discuss a painting together or go round the corner shopping like two old friends . She was in awe a little of her own body , while Anthony had an acute crisis of first-child neurosis about her and its safety ; but even that susceptibility to couvade seemed endearing and fallible . If we all laughed at his fussing there , he made us laugh in turn about the sillier Catholic side of Rome . They both wore their religion very lightly . Nell and I used to tease them about Sunday Mass : they would debate ( putting it on for us ) churches like a pair of gourmets over a Michelin guide . We used to celebrate our own mass while they were out , making love naked in the sun on the terrace . We decided they were incipiently square , but nice to know . The real bible that summer , for all four of us , was Sea and Sardinia . Imperial Rome , we agreed , was vulgar beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We pursued them wherever their sites lay in range . We were playing pagan , of course ; and eternalOxford aesthetes . The climax and epitome of those blue-and-ochre weeks took place at Tarquinia . The tombs were still locked away from the public at that time , but Anthony pulled the name of one of his new Senior Common-Room friends on the curator and we were allowed a tour . It was early evening when we finished . It had been a memorable experience : in my case some kind of avatar of so many things I had derived from the Devon countryside as a boy . I felt it spoke more123deeply to mc , even though Anthony knew far more about the Etruscans in scholarly terms . I think it was As , ) the first time I had a clear sense of the futility of the notion of pi ogress in . irt : nothing could be better or lovelier than this , till the end of time . It was sad , but in a noble , haunting , fertile way . We went back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , as one does at that age , about our feelings , how terribly moving it all was , how  --  then suddenly decided that we would give ourselves the night there . ' We tried two or three hotels , but they were full of holidaying Italians . However , a waiter in one of them told us of an isolated pensione down by the sea three miles away , and the two girls and I overruled Anthony 's doubts . The place had only one free room left , but it contained two double beds , and we dismissed the ancient taxi that had brought us . We had a long meal and more wine under a vinetrellisoutside . It was very airless and afterwards , a little drunk , we idled along the beach beside the silent , listless sea . Then Nell and Jane decided they wanted to swim . So we undressed , pairing off by sex , not marriage . I saw the two girls wade in , then both turn and call to us . They stood hand-in-hand , like a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure which was which , though Jane was an inch or two taller than Nell . I was thinking , He 's never seen Nell 's breasts and pubic hair before . She said , Oh they 're hopeless . They 're shy . ' They turned and went on wading in . The beach ran out very shallowly , for a long way . Anthony and I followed . The girls ahead of us stood with the water round their waists , then plunged forward , one of them with a small scream . Then they were swimming . A few seconds later Anthony and I plunged as well and swam out to join them . They had stopped where they could just stand , having discovered the sea was phosphorescent . Glaucous trails glimmered behind each movement . We made a circle , talking about the phenomenon , swirling our arms through the mild water . Then Jane reached out her hands to Anthony and myself and we made a ring as Nell in turn took our free hands . It was ridiculous , childish , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring-aring-a-roses . I think it was Nell who made us begin to circle gently . The depth we were in made any but very slow movement im-I24possible . Four heads without bodies ; touches beneath the water . 1 felt Jane 's bare foot , but I knew it was by accident . I could see Anthony smiling at me opposite . Perhaps those beautiful tomb-walls somewhere inland behind the beach ; perhaps the fact that the holiday was near its end ; no , something deeper than that , a mysterious unison , and strangely uncarnal , in spite of our naked bodies . I have had very few religious moments in my life . The profound difference between Anthony and myself  --  and our types of mankind  --  is that I did for a few moments there feel unaccountably happy ; yet I could see that for him , the supposedly religious man , this was no more than a faintly embarrassingmidnight jape . Or I can put it like this : he saw me as the brother-in-law he liked , I saw him as the brother I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an evanescence  --  an intense closeness , yet no more durable than the tiny shimmering organismsin the water around us . I tried repeatedly in later years to put those few moments into my work  --  and always had to cut them out . It took me time to discover that even atheists need a sense of blasphemy . And loss . Like the vanished Etruscans , we should never be together like that again . Perhaps I knew that then , also . One of the hostesses woke mc , we were coming into London . I went and had a wash ; set my watch forward once again . Barney was standing by my seat when I returned . Dan , Margaret 's meeting me . Can we give you a lift into town ? ' I should have liked to refuse , but it seemed churlish . At that time of night I would n't have to ask them in for a drink . We got off the plane and through passport control together ; and waited for our luggage together . He went to fetch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt unreal , in a bad dream , still not properly awake . He was grinning when he came back . Either you have a marvellous daughter or I have a telepathic secretary . ' I looked back through the Customs counters . I could n't distinguishCaro 's among the scatter of distant faces , but Barney said , She 's with Margaret . I think you have your own transport . ' A hand waved , and I waved back . I 'd told her in the cable not to wait up for me , let alone fag out to Heathrow . The luggage began its slowmotionspill . None of it fell well for me ; and I do n't mean the luggage . Barney 's wife was still an unimpressive little woman , tired and faded under the set smile and the make-up . She had not aged well ; but then she had always seemed to me anomalous , suburban to Barney 's urban . I vaguely remembered their house , in neverswingingMuswell Hill . Caro looked oddly apprehensive , no doubt at not having told me herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney , then I was hugging her . I held her severely away by the shoulders . I thought I gave orders . ' My own boss now . ' I embraced her again ; and heard Barney 's voice . Not to worry , Caroline . I 've given you a marvellous reference . ' Thank you , Mr Dillon . ' 126I took thc little edge in her answer to be mocking : knowing he was sneaking home ahead of plan . Dan , you remember Margaret ? ' Of course . ' We shook hands , there was a brief four-way conversation about Barney 's coining home early , small worlds ... nothings . We moved outside , I led the way with Margaret . I heard Caro ask Barney how some interview had gone , but did n't catch his answer . When they cone up beside us , he was asking her not to ring him the next day unless it was desperate ' . And for God 's sake do n't tell anyone I 'm back . ' Right . ' Renewed insistence from Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then into their car , then I wheeled the trolley on down to where Caro had parked her Mini . I stood watching her while she unlocked it : she was wearing a long coat I had n't seen before . And . t face . She held the door open while I manoeuvred the suitcases intothe back . I know why you 've come . Mummy told me yesterday . ' Is she in Oxford ? ' The Runt 's got mumps rather badly . She 's gone back to Comptonfor a couple of days . ' The Runt was her ten-year-old halfbrother , Andrew 's son and heir : they went in for a sort of Mitfordianfamily slang . I straightened and looked at her . Surprised ? ' She nodded , and looked down . I feel very sorry for him , Caro . In spite of family history . ' I know , Daddy . ' Her daddy 's often had faint inverted commas around them ; but these were stamped hard . She went round to the driving-door and unlocked that . I bent myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' She looked through the windscreen . The Dillons ' car , ahead of us , moved off : It just seems rather sad that something like this has to happen to bring you together again . ' Darling , if you came to tell me that your generation of the family thinks mine have behaved like cretins ... ' I came because I love you . Right ? ' I27I leant and kissed her check , and she switched on the engine . I rang Aunt Jane this evening . When I got your cable . ' How did she sound ? ' We moved ofl She made a bad gear-change and grimaced . In control . As always . We talked about me mostly . ' I 'll try and catch up with some sleep . Then I 'll go . ' Yes , I said I thought you would . ' She hesitated . She 's ver ; grateful . ' I was looking for an excuse . I 've missed you out there . ' She said nothing for a moment , though she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , and I was glad she had brought it so quickly into the open . Yes . And I still missed you . ' They say she 's very bright . ' I left a pause . Did it shock you ? ' Do n't be silly . I used to rather fancy you myself . ' Now I 'm the one who 's shocked . ' I used to tell my best friends at school . How devastating you were . ' Like the H-bomb ? ' She grinned . Yes ? ' When I was Iittle and you took me on that grand ancestral tour in Devon . That was the first time I 'd really thought about you and Mummy . I could n't think why she 'd ever left such a nice man . ' She added , Of course , that was before I really knew you . ' If you were n't being so sweet ... ' The grin lingered , but I sensed something troubled underneath , something that could n't be said , that had to be hidden under this teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We headed for the tunnel to the M4 . And how 's Richard ? ' That 's all over , as a matter of fact . ' I gave her a quick look . She was a shade too set on her driving ; but then she twitched her mouth and shrugged . I had once watched her show-jumping at a gymkhana , in her horsy phase . Whatever she lacked elsewhere , she took her fences straight and brave . Since when ? ' ' About a month ago . Since I last wrote . ' 128Someone else ? ' Just ... ' and again she shrugged . Poor old Richard . I rather liked him . ' No you did n't . You thought he was an Old Etonian nit . ' Contradicting me like that was not new . She had taken to it ( luring the time I had set to work on her debutantisms ; telling me she might be a fool , but she knew my true opinions from those I sometimes humoured her with . She said , And you were right . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We came out of the tunnel . I had that dislocation of long journeys , where nothing , even familiar landscape , has reality ; where most or you is still where you came from . The awful winter dankness of England . It all happened down at Compton , really . We went for the weekend . I suppose seeing him being given the future son-in-law treatmentwas the last straw . ' Hardly his fault ? ' He 's so fantastically square . Under the surface . Honestly he was horrid , he was lapping it all up . Sucking up like mad to Andrew . Pretending he was interested in milk-yield and shooting and God knows what else . I suddenly realized what a phony he is . Not only about all that . ' Then you 're right to chuck him out . ' The unfortunate Richard had been very much a male equivalent of Caro ; not university material at all . His family owned a famous London publishing house , and he 'd been learning the trade on the fine old English principle that since natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ever be required . Ile had picked up some vaguely left-wing views among the properly resentful underlings he would one day mismanage  --  or perhaps he just needed to try out on me opinions that must have been unspeakableat home . ' He was so beastly , you 've no idea . He had the nerve to say Fleet Street was corrupting me . He told me one day I was getting sharp . " Rather vulgar , dear girl . " I threw a gin-bottle at him , I absolutely saw red . The bloody nerve of the man . ' She said , And do n't grin . ' There is some of the flat left ? ' n u 129'This was at his place . ' Good . Ncvcr throw your own gin . ' She bit her lips . We climbed up on to the M4 . You knew from the start . You could have told me . With my track record in picking ideal partners ... You must have learnt something . ' Too late . ' She digested that . Are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no . I 'm not . ' I did n't mean ... I know you did n't . ' Cross-purposes ; they were always inherent between us . Somethingin her had changed . Perhaps it was no more than the normal effect of six months in a new world . I had an idea that she had had a bruising in Fleet Street ; and bruising back had become her defence . The rather vulgar ' I would n't wear ; but there did indeed seem a new sharpness , some sort of shift from innocence to aggression . The crack about fancying me would not have been possible six months previously ; nor the implicit reprimand about older-generation stupidity . And the job ? ' Love it . Even the mad hours . ' And your new boss ? ' It 's fun working for him . Lots of variety . I seem to spend half my life on the telephone . ' Why did n't you write and tell me ? ' I was a tiny bit afraid you 'd be ... I know he gave you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones as well . And no excuse . ' My dreadful English . ' I knew something was embarrassed in her , and tried to relieve it . Never mind . Now I 'm back . ' But evidently her mind was still running on my being offended by Barney . Actually it 's half how I got the job . I had to do some typing for him , and he asked about the name . ' She added , I could n't very well turn it down . It 's quite a promotion . ' Of course . I 'm delighted for you . ' 130After a moment she said , Mummy told me you 'd never really liked him . ' That 's all from before the Flood . ' Did you talk on the plane ? ' We had a chat . Old times . All that . About you . ' He rather envies you actually . ' I was given that line a bit . ' He means it . Envy 's the wrong word . He says he admires almost everything you 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's terribly insecure . Underneath . ' I said nothing . They 're all the same , you ca n't imagine what a bunch of self-pitiers they all are . We all get it . The secretaries . And the rivalries , you know , they 're so petty , if A gets half a column more than B , or C has a private lunch with his nibs or D gets a new byline mug-shot . If they did n't go to El Vino 's and backbite each other every day they 'd go mad . Actually Bernard 's better than most of them . He can at least laugh about it . ' He had always used his proper first name in print ; but I deduced that he would have preferred me to usc it to his face now . Caro said , It 's absurdly like the village at home , really . All spying and gossip and everyone knowing everything about everyone else . ' I had to smile to myself : this new-found authority and objectivity . I had been careful in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what is publicly considered glamorous  --  side of my own life . Whatever narcissism I had had at Oxford , I had managed to ban from my life that particularly odious variety so peculiar to the movie world . My study at the flat has books on its walls , and still a mirror or two ; but not those ultimate lying mirrors , the framed awards and gilt statuettes , the posters and cast stills ; and I had similarly kept her away from famous names . I began to suspect it had n't really been necessary . We talked then about family things , about Uncle Anthony , what Jane would do , their children . She became more the daughter I had left behind in the summer . We arrived home and I carried my suitcasesup the stairs behind her . I felt fatally awake by then , the wretched time-lag was taking its usual toll . Jenny would be in het apartment five thousand sunlit miles away , having a shower perhaps131after the day 's shooting , the evening still ahead ; or she might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gathering up her bits and pieces for the move to the Cabin ; had a great desire to call California ; and killed it . The weaning had to commence . There were fresh flowers in the living-room , an unopened bottle of whisky , Malvern water and a glass by the fireplace . Caro played the dutiful daughter , switched on the electric fire , made sure I noticed all these signs of the welcome-home . I kissed her . Now bed for you . You 're ten times nicer than I deserve . ' When do you want breakfast ? ' When do you have to be in ? ' It does n't matter . With Bernard officially away . As long as I 'm there by midday . ' I probably sha n't sleep much . You wake me when you get up . ' I 've made the bed and everything . ' Bless you . And for fetching me . Now hop it . ' She went , and I poured myself a whisky , then stared round the room . There was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bar a pile of mail , which I was n't going to face till the morning , it seemed exactly as I had left it months before , and that disappointedme . I had hoped Caro would give herself a little more freedom , though I knew that for her home ' must always mean Compton ... Versailles to a cottage , no comparison . I had stayed there only once , long before Nell became its chatelaine . Andrew had thrown a famous ball for his twenty-first birthdayand all fashionable student Oxford had descended  --  cars , coaches ... one group from the Bullingdon side of his life had even turned up in a coach-and-four , someone blowing a posthorn . Compton Nine-Acres ( it had nearer nine thousand in fact , in those days ) was n't perhaps a great house as country-houses go , but it was impressive enough : the gardens , the parkland , the seemingly endlessrooms , all that spaciousness and graciousness . It was a very long way from any world I was familiar with . I suppose that even then that celebratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days , Andrew 's father 's terminal fling against the post-war socialist present . It must have been one of the last full-blown traditionaloccasions of its kind  --  there was n't only the ball , there was a132tenants ' and village party on the lawn the preceding afternoon . Tennis , cricket , croquet , riding ; endless champagne and superb food for those days of rationing . Some scarlet-uniformed local band , their silver instruments under the shade of a huge beech ; a pair of trousers being hauled up a flagpole ; and Andrew drunk throughout . Even Anthony enjoyed it , though he hardly knew Andrew at college ; we were there largely because of the girls , of course , not that Andrew then showed any particular interest in them . At Oxford his sex-life was a little of a mystery . One would see him about with girls , and he was reputed to frequent a Mayfair brothel ; but one associated him much more with hunting , beagling and drinking . We half suspected he was slightly queer ; and I remember Nell being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from Caro that the house and its old facons de vivre had gone the way of all things  --  that death duties had severely diminishedthe estate , the park had largely gone under the plough , that Nell had to make do ( and complained endlessly ) with the help of an Italian couple and a daily woman from the village . But just as I had envied Andrew that departed world in my one glimpse of it , so I still envied Caro its remnants . It was all very well condemning such worlds politically  --  nothing easier . But it was like some of Ezra Pound 's poetry . You could blow the philosophy to bits ; the lines and images still haunted you . I sat there sipping my drink , once more tempted to blame Nell for everything and thinking of the immediate future . Presumably she would very soon be back in Oxford at Jane 's side ; and whatever other reconciliations might take place , I doubted whether there could ever be a sincere one between us two . If I had been technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cause . No doubt all divorces repeat the Adam and Eve situation . Genesis is as silent as the grave concerning what happened when they were expelled from Eden , except for their producing a corpse and a murderer by way of children . Our Cain-and-Abel had been a total unforgivingness . For nearly three years after the action I virtually did not speak with Nell . Occasionally she brought Caro to London , usually I went down to Oxford for the day . We would exchange a few frigid commonplaces over the child 's head at the hand-over place , and133when I brought her back . I was prepared , after a while and for purely civilized reasons , to be warmer , but Nell wasn't. i'Iten one day she wrote to say she wanted to meet me in London without Caro . She had something to discuss . I presumed it was to do with the alimony . I could afford more then , though I was n't going to give it without a battle . Nell was very far from poor , and she knew I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come for a finer pound of flesh . She was going to marry Andrew . My first reaction was an incredulous repetition of his name . I had read of his father 's death at about the time of our divorce and I realized he had come into the title ; but I still saw the condescending young drunkard of our joint past , the impossible drawl , the posing , the blend of Regency rake and Tony Lumpkin ... to say nothing of the summary he had been of all we at least pretended to despise . His one virtue had been a kind of outrageousness , that was why one had tolerated him . I was n't forgiven that instinctive response to the news and by way of punishment she would tell me very little of how they had met , except that it had been some six months before , by chance , in Oxford . Now he happened ' to be very much in love with her  --  fantastic though that may seem ' . I noticed that she did not say she was very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had to think of Caroline , who apparently adored ' him . They had been to stay at Compton . I had to accept the fact , improbable though it was ; but I could n't understand wiry it had to be announced to me in this face-to-face way . Nell made a little speech about Caro being my daughter and my presumably ' having some faint ' interest in her future ; and there were new financial arrangements to discuss . I was n't taken in by this sudden descent from crowing to consultation , and I suspect Nell half hoped I would be violently angry or try to stop her  --  or it may have been that Anthony and Jane , though they had by then banned me from all contact with them , were still prey to scruples and had argued that she must do this . I am quite sure she was not angling for some sort of reconciliation ; it was far more as if I must be made to see what I had reduced her to ... which was absurd . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baronet ; and I could even believe Iie was in love with her , since he must have had free range over any number of eligible young county dollies from his134own world . Perhaps she did n't really know herself why she had come . She was very nervous , and taking the first major independent decision of her life , and I might have been kinder . So she duly became Lady Randall . We had met more than briefly only three or four times since then . On all but one occasion Caro had been present , and we had been on our best behaviour . The other time Andrew had been there  --  that was the most recent meeting , to discuss Caro 's future now she had to leave school . It had been rather comic , since after a stiff beginning ( we two men had n't seen each other since Oxford ) Andrew and I had decided that we were , beyond the barriers erected by our very different ways of life and political convictions , both reasonably amusing and interesting fellows . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self liked the shrewd squire in him , his still not quite dead love of the outrageous clearly took to the show-business gossip I offered on my side . We talked about the old days at Oxford . Nell grew increasingly silent as the evening drew on and Andrew and I got agreeably drunk . I knew he would have been happy to have me down to Compton ; and that such sanity would take place over Nell 's dead body . I was very glad she was now his wife when we finally left Wheeler 's and said goodbye . All water under the bridge ; and sitting there in the flat , with more whisky , my thoughts returned to Jenny . I wanted to hear her voice ; or her voice as reminder of a simpler , less sentenced present . Perhaps Nell was right , there had always been an aura of despair about the flat , of makeshift and wrong choice . I was staring at the telephone , very near to giving way . Then suddenly the real present was in the doorway again : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that something was wrong . She had been supposedly gone to bed for at least twenty minutes , and now she wore the air of a both disobedientand reproving child . I ca n't sleep . ' Have a whisky then . ' She shook her head , but came into the room . She went to one of the windows , the curtains were n't drawn , and stared out . I said , Caro ? ' For three or four seconds she said nothing . I 'm having an affaire with Bernard , daddy . ' She stared down at135the street below . I 'm very sorry . I did n't know how to tell yot earlier . ' I felt shock , but no flash of disbelief ; if anything , a fool for nog having worked it out for myself . They had both thrown dust in m ) eyes , but there had been enough clues . She murmured , Please say something . ' How did it happen , for God 's sake ? ' She shrugged , still turned away : how does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth she saw in him . Ile had looked to me every year of his age , I had even congratulated myself on not lookingso pouched and raddled , physically gone to seed ... ' I did n't know he was coming home with you . The last time we talked he said another two days . When I saw ... his wife , I wanted to run away . But she saw me first . ' She does n't know ? ' She shook her head . I suppose she suspects . Their marriage has been empty for years . ' Are you in love with him ? ' I feel sorry for him . I do n't know . ' This is why you did n't write ? ' She nodded , and I thought for a moment that she was going to cry . I went and fetched another glass , poured a little whisky in , went to where she was . Come and sit down . ' She let me lead her to the settee and sat down beside me . Does your mother know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell her . Just yet . ' We both looked at the glasses in our hands . ' Why are you telling me ? ' Because I 've spent most of my life not telling you the truth . Because ... ' but she shrugged again . You seem rather miserable about it . ' Only about having to inflict it on you . ' And ? ' Meeting his wife like that . ' She added in a lower voice , His coming back without telling me . ' Do you imagine you 're his first infidelity ? ' I 'm not a total innocent . ' 136Then you know the score . Margaret , he does n't leave . ' I added , ' God knows why . ' She said nothing . ' Is this why you dropped Richard ? ' She shook her head . ' That 's been coming for months now . ' ' But it is why you 're his secretary ? ' ' I 'm quite good at my job . Incredible though it may seem . ' She glanced at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother once threw the same unjustified sarcasm at me . In another context . ' ' I 'm sorry . ' ' My dear , your ability to take shorthand is n't what worries me . ' ' But that it 's someone you despise . ' She was staring down at the carpet . I said evenly , ' I do n't despise him personally , Caro . Or not more than anyone else in that world . ' ' Which you advised me to enter . ' ' Guilty . But in the hopes you 'd see through it . ' ' As Bernard does . Far more than you seem to realize . ' ' But goes on living in it ? ' ' He 's not as lucky as some people . Apart from anything else he has a wife and three children to support . ' ' All right . Fair enough . ' She remained obstinately looking down ; the gymkhana again , but now she was like a rider who has forgotten which fence comes next . ' Tell me why you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle . On his own . And grateful . ' ' So he ought to be . ' She left a pause . ' Also I can talk to him . ' ' Is that an accusation ? ' She shook her head , but not very convincingly . ' Come on . Out with it . ' ' Talk seriously . ' ' What about ? ' ' All sorts of things I ca n't talk about with you . Or Mummy . ' ' Such as ? ' ' You do n't seem able to understand that anyone could love you both . For all your faults . ' She went on before I could answer . ' I know she can be a bitch , I know you can be at least half the selfish bastard she thinks you are . It 's not just you two . The whole family . We seem to have banned and buried so much . ' ' You know what happened . ' 137It 's not the past . It 's what I feel about you both . Non ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? ' She said nothing , and I had to coax her . If that does n't sound too old-fashioned . ' He feels guilty about ... his wife . ' I doubted that ; or suspected that such a guilt , or decency , was too attractive and convenient a ploy to be as disinterested as she made it sound . And if one day he decided he was n't any more ? ' I have n't lost my head . It 's not like that . ' There was a silence . I drank from my own glass ; she still had not touched hers . Is this what he was supposed to telephone me about ? ' We did discuss it . He knew what you 'd feel . ' Did you ? ' Not at the beginning . ' And I have n't much ground to stand on , have I ? ' That 's nothing to do with it . At all . ' Are you sure ? ' Daddy , I 'm not ashamed that you 're still rather an attractive man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean ? ' I know you despise all that world as well . But he 's a much better father than you 'll ever be . ' She added , Perhaps just because he 's always there . And he can handle Mummy . ' I left a silence . You seem to think I despise everything , Caro . ' You expect everyone to think and feel like you . ' She added , I 'm not blaming you , you 're probably right about Fleet Street , but ... ' again she shook her head . I did n't know whether she was accusing my career or my nature ; it was not a new accusation , though it had never been brought quite so near to the bone before . My only consolation was that it must hide a certain doubt in Caro herself . Will you at least promise me that when you 're married you 'll have more than one child ? ' She searched my eyes . Why do you say that ? ' Because single children are always intensely self-absorbed . But138also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them . It is n't quite as simple as their never having time for anyone else . ' I just meant your work . ' She managed a rueful little smile . ' Anyway , it 's too late now to trade you in . ' At least we 're agreed on something . ' She passed inc her glass . I do n't want this . ' I poured its contents into my own and she stood up and went to the fireplace , her back to me . Are you angry because he did n't tell you himself ? ' I can see it was difficult . I just wish he had n't tried so hard to sell himself as a pathetic failure . I do n't know who he 's trying to kid . ' I should have thought you would . You always  --  ' but she bit the sentence off . Go on . Truth time . ' You do n't exactly oversell your own professional life . ' That 's mainly because I 've seen too many movieland children drilled into uncritical admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've conned me . Quite a lot of people at work think I 'm rather lucky to be your daughter . ' That 's a press-clippings view of life . ' She was silent a moment . When Bernard moans , lie 's much more convincing . People are always attacking hint . Nobody attacks you. , Sweetie , all this is proving my point . Middle-aged men may seem mature and knowledgable and all the rest of it . But when they have to have girlfriends of your and Jenny 's age , they 're not . Deep down they 're still frustrated adolescents . Running scared . They 're in a panic . ' What are you in a panic about ? ' She said it with a strange mixture of shyness and aggression . But it touched me , it defined so precisely the gap between us . I thought of Jenny 's dry impatience before the same line . Even allowing for the three years or so of difference in age , Jenny was a much shrewder and less dependent girl ; but I half sensed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purge the spoken of the un-139spoken , to institute a simplicity in place of an obscuring complexity . ' That 's something we 'll talk about another day . Or night . ' I could see from her face that she felt she was being fobbed off . ' Caro , Jenny 's had a lot of experience . She 's acquired a kind of ... armour ? I do n't want you hurt . Used . That 's all . ' We seemed to have reached an impasse . Caro was sublimely ignorant of Freud  --  and of classical tragedy , for that matter . I could imagine , given the narrow limits of her cultural world and the British mania for television , that Barney had more mundane attractions for her . He was a household name in his way ; and just as for the masses he wore a liberal intellectual 's face on camera , I could guess that the Pagliacci face he showed Caro in private would be convincing enough . It would have been child 's play to seem both glamorous and vulnerable to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her depth , in need of a protector . If my own bill of health was cleaner it was only because Jenny had an innate scepticism and the resolution to inflict it when the sobs grew too loud . ' Will you tell him you 've spoken to me ? ' ' I 'll have to , wo n't I ? ' Then more silence . Mine was spent in strangling impossible questions : what 's he like in bed , have you brought him here , how widely known is it ... she was pretty enough to have made it a physical thing , but there must have been a dozen other girls in that building with her looks  --  and with a comfortable superiority in what constitutes attraction , at least for men like Barney , out of bed . I felt angrier and angrier , almost like picking up the telephone and having it out with him there and then . In the end I got up and went to the whisky again . I wanted to put my arm round her , but it seemed wrong ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro ? ' She looked down into the fireplace and said nothing . ' You could have gone on in secret . ' ' And not bothered you ? ' ' That 's a foul hit . ' ' Sorry . ' ' Then tell me . ' Still she was silent . ' Do you want me to do something about it ? ' ' Just understand me , I suppose . ' 140'And give you my blessing ? ' She turned away . ' Why did Jenny McNeil fall in love with you ? ' I felt the force of the petard then . ' Love 's hardly the word . ' ' Then whatever word you do use . ' ' So you can use it back ? ' It was too harsh , and I went on quickly . ' She was simply a bit thrown by the life out there . Feeling lonely . And hardly short of experience with younger men . ' I said , ' Who are n't all like Richard , you know . ' ' I realize that . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're happy . ' ' I was . Until today . ' ' I 'll get over it . You must show me a little grace . ' She nodded , then turned and sat on the arm of a chair . ' I 'd better tell you something else . ' ' What ? ' ' I spent this afternoon looking for flats . I think I 've found one I can afford . ' I did want to be angry with her then , I 'd very much have liked to be an American Jewish or a working-class father , anything other than feeling caught in that dreadful English middle-class trap of never showing or saying what you really feel . I certainly saw that I was to be taken at full tilt ... or not at all . ' I'mn going down to Thorncombe as soon as possible . ' ' I think I 'd rather . ' ' Where is it ? ' ' Near Parliament Hill . Kentish Town , really . ' ' That 's pretty grubby , is n't it ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must let me  --  ' ' I 've saved a lot . Living here . ' We had a little argument about that , but she was adamant ; and I realized that ' Kentish Town ' was partly symbolic  --  not only her father was being rejected . I also remembered that it was on the way to Muswell Hill . The place fell vacant in a couple of weeks , it seemed . It was furnished , but she wanted to ' borrow ' a table and one or two other things . Perhaps she wanted to give me at least one141small chance to feel still needed . Then there was a silence , too little and too much to say . She stood and took her last fence ; came and stood in front of me , leant forward clumsily and kissed me on the cheek . She let me hold her for a few moments . Then she turned and left the room . Cut . Forwards BackwardsSix hours later , ten o'clock on a chilling London winter morning , a dank mist over everything outside : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough by the time Caro was tapping on my door . Lying there , I felt the next stage of the long journey disorientation : I had never left London , California was a dream . I must have had depressive real dreams , anxiety ones , though I could n't remember them , perhaps because the real anxieties flooded back with the grey daylight  --  Caro 's news , the coming ordeal later that day at Oxford , I must try to ring Jenny , then David Malevich , all that mail waiting , my accountant , my dentist ... a great deal too much reality . Caro helped . I was given the full treatment for breakfast , no Continental nonsense ; a dry look askance from the electric stove . She was trying , she said , to make up for last night ' , and reconciliationwas easy . She told me more about the flat , across the table while I ate , and I tried to accept it as a natural thing : wanting to strike out on her own , live like other girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning her about Jane and Anthony . Over the last two years I had got her to talk , if not quite openly , at least unemotionallyabout Compton and its inmates , but the same was n't true of her Oxford relatives . I knew a little of what had happened to the three children , Caro 's cousins ; but I had no very clear picture at all of what Jane and Anthony themselves had become . Though she hinted at a certain puzzlement with Anthony , he could be so dry , you did n't always understand whether he was being serious or funny , I had detected a strong affection in her for both of them . They 'd always treated her exactly as if she were their own daughter , she felt that . She thought Aunt Jane had gone off ' the Catholic thing , but it was sort of something ' one did n't talk about . She was terribly efficient , lots of committees and things , much more practicalthan Mummy ; an awfully good cook , I 'd love their house . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he'd143found at Compton two or three years before , but she could n't remember its name . I took the impression , amid all her chatter , that Jane had changed much more than Anthony . What memories I had of her on the domestic side were of a distinctly slapdash approach to food , not could I associate her with worthy committees and left-wing causes  --  I gathered that latter detail from something Caro dropped in about Andrew : how he sometimes called Jane her Red aunt ' ... though nc doubt the faintest shade of pink would seem red to him . My final picture was of a brisk , well-organized and self-possessed woman who contrasted rather favourably in Caro 's eyes with the temperamentand occasional bossiness of her own mother . She took herself off just after eleven , giving me messages for them in Oxford . I promised to ring her that night , we 'd have a whole evening together as soon as I could get back . We kissed . Then I stood at the window and watched her slight figure cross the misted street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and waved , and I waved back . Then I went and looked in her room  --  the one she 'd had as a baby , though it had been two or three times redecorated since then . It was rather sad , in some way like Jenny 's apartment in Los Angeles ; depersonalized and temporary , a shade too tidy , as if she were still living in a hostel . No litter of clothes , of cosmetics , none of the junk one might have seen in the room of a student of her age . No books . A painting of an old carthorse , worn and frameless , that we had bought off a stall in the Portobello Road one Saturday morning just before I left for California . There were some snaps of the family down at Compton stuck in the side of her dressing-table mirror ; and I saw one of the Cabin at Abe 's that I had sent her . I suppose I was looking for some positive evidence that Barney came to the flat ... or letters , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really looking for Caro . Perhaps her room at Compton was the same ; her other room I knew , down at Thorncombe , was certainly so . That whole enterpriseI had also had to count , at least with respect to her , as a failure ; another , if more complicated , hoist from my own petard . She had come to me one Easter in the early 196os , for a whole week . She was just eleven , and we 'd never spent such a long time144AIonc together . I felt trepidation about it , and so must have she . We had a very sticky first day together in London ; and then somehowwe got on to grandparents . It seemed suddenly to dawn on her th.it there were two on my side that she had never met . I told her a little about my life at her age , and I saw a spark of interest , a curiosity-that was new in our relationship . There and then I abandoned tle programme I had vaguely in mind for our week in London : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatres . I proposed on the spot a tripwn to Devon , her grand ancestral tour ' . She was faintly shocked dt lrst , with the odd gravity of little girls , but then took to the idea with such excitement that I kicked myself for not having thought of it earlier . I had been there only once , on a rather similar trip with Aunt Millie some six years before , since my father had died . I suppose it had been nagging at my unconscious for several years . 11ut now it abruptly assumed the same attraction for me as it evidntlydid for Caro . It was still for jokes , really ; I had the place in perspective , or so I considered . Every year I sent the present incumbentfive pounds to have my parents ' graves tended ; and I was fool enough to think I could push the place into oblivion at such a price . So we went to the church and stood by the graves of her grandp.trents . She looked both embarrassed and sad ... and I made her giggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit so many Sundays , the Apostles and Elders on the rood screen , the Cumaean Sibyl , the fusty absurdity of it all . Though something , at the graves , had made me feel sad , too . For the first time in years I remembered the wild oxlips and the Quaker 's Bonnet primroses that had once always R carpeted my mother at that time of spring . We called at the Vicarage . That looked much the same outside ; but the old kitchen-garden had gone , and all its fruit-trees . Now a new village hall and half an acre of tarmac stood in its place ; and for a moment that seemed a worse desecration than if they had bulldozedthe church itself . Round the house some of the old garden remained , though it was obviously now in far less skilled hands . But the OsmantJuts still flourished , the Myrtle , the Trichodendron had branches full of hanging red buds ... and I was even able to show off to Caro and the current vicar 's wife over the names . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove Caro there  --  ' 45for my sake , not hers  --  by way of Thorncombe . That was how learnt it was for sale . It was already empty and I made the fat : mistake of letting her talk me into a poke round . Rather to my suz prise , in view of the grand country-house she lived in herself , sh loved it ; I was touched ... for reasons she knew nothing abou though as we wandered in the yard and peered through windows told her a little of the people who had once lived there . She wishe I lived in a place like this , she could have a pony , I could go ti church again  --  we had already made an enormous leap in those day away , and she was timidly learning how to tease me  --  I laughed and teased her gently back , perhaps I 'd buy it just for her . She kneN I was n't even remotely serious , and so did I , although I had inci dentally learnt she did not like my living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of the auction on the board by the lane . Nor had I forgotten it , or the secret depths of the day , when I ha ( seen her into bed that same evening . I sat down in the lounge over book , but not reading . As with all significant places on that emotion charged map of childhood and adolescence we carry round with u in later life , my first sight of Thorncombe after so many years had been disappointing . It had lost all its green secrecy , its liddenness its charm ; it seemed dwarfed , trite ; perhaps because I was witl Caro , and she was enthusing innocently but trivially over something a little sacred . There were other factors , of course : I too was tired o : London , for over a year I had been travelling . I began to feel the need of somewhere to retreat , to rest up ... I was tempted . But ther I saw all the disadvantages , the futility of pretending that I was not now rootless by choice as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remembered , as I had discovered over a cup of tea at the Vicarage , by a very different self . By the time I went to bed , with Caro asleep on the other side of the room , I had dismissed the whole idea . The next day we drove further west , but we kept a small joke going about the place . I would have to buy it if she really wanted it ; and she pretended she did . I knew it was nothing as a practical wish , but very far from without meaning as regards ourselves . I caught her looking at me once or twice , strangely , and blushing when she was caught ; and I knew what that was about as well . We returned to London , she went off home , and I missed her a great146 , I , . Ll more than ever in the past . I kept seeing her standing beside me In the churchyard , not knowing what to make of those two yellowlichenedstones ; and saw myself in her . A week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hired a taxi , went to the agents , then straight out to Thorncombe . It was a grey afternoon , and it began to drizzle while I was there . The tired ghosts , the empty rooms . I went to bed that night in the Newton hotel more or less certain that I was on a wild-goose chase . But the next day dawned brighter , I gave it one last chance . I wandered round the orchard , went up the hill through the beechwoodsbehind , and some of the old magic crept back . I did not want the thirty acres of pasture that went with the place , but the agent had told me they could easily be sold off later , or let for keep . The buildings needed a lot of money spent on them . A hideous row of breeze-block pighouses had to be got rid of , an equally unsightly Dutch barn . But I began to see how the old farmhouse with its still splendid doorway and the two ancient stone barns behind could be converted . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; but quite as much a kind of anger that so much had been allowed to go to rack and ruin . I had detected an apologetic note even in the agent 's voice . Too much land had been sold off to attract serious farmers ; too much else was ruined for it to attract private buyers . Meanwhile it stood rather like an old farm dog  --  not a chance simile , I could remember just such a dog from the summer when my whole being had lain in that house and how sure its place had been there  --  an old wall-eyed Welsh collie called True , and as safe from the shotgun as an aged human being . Then I toldit myself it was simply a cutting job , a potentially good scene that needed the blue pencil and a rewrite . And Caro : this money says I love you . Of course she had come to stay , even spent holidays there , brought friends , and her own pony down in a loose-box from Compton ; but by that time puberty and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some strange way it had seemed even to distance us . I sensed that for her it was at best an amusing little place , at worst rather dull and  --  her stepfather 's vocabulary  --  ' plebby ' ; and then I so obviously was n't very serious147. , . oin was prepared . I tried to explain that a hotel would do ... but no no , she expect you here . The young lady , or her English , vended peremptory about that , so I told her what train I was i . ching ; and that I should be with them soon after six. about it myself . Caro never belonged there , had never , beyond that brief first passion , which had really been with discovering herself my daughter , been in love with it . We had used it a little more during that last year or so , but I still felt she came under duress . It was not home . She had not been once on her own , in my absence . I had , when she finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to California . But there was the remembrance of the fiasco over Thorncombe , the need for her to find her own feet and work for a living ( or at least go through the motions ) in London ; a not wanting to plunge her into such a totally alien en- vironment and culture , where I should inevitably have to leave her on her own a lot ; the then attachment to Richard and  --  last but not least  --  the problem of Nell , who I knew would fight the idea tooth and nail . My final decision had also been selfish : the lupine hater of encumbrance in me , if it did not foresee Jenny , did script other situations where Caro might be a nuisance . I think that if she had only hinted that she would have liked to come ... but she did n't . And now I went into the living-room and stood staring at the mist outside , trying to decide whether to risk Oxford by car or to take a train . There had been fog warnings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom large . It was not that I could n't imagine what might happen , be said and felt . As at so many poten- tially fraught junctures in my life I could invent too many varia- tions , almost as if I lived the event to its full before its limited reality took place . All writing , private and mental , or public and literal , is an attempt to escape from the conditioned past and future . But the hyper-active imagination is as damaging a preparation for reality as it is useful in writing . I knew I would n't say the things I was already rehearsing ; and could n't stop rehearsing . In the end I made a practical American in me lose patience with the introverted Englishman and rang the R.A.C. weather centre . They did not recommend journeys by car ; so I found out the train times . Then , without giving myself further time for thought , I dialled the Oxford number Caro had given me . The voice of a girl with a foreign accent answered . Mrs Mallory was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less formal . Mrs Mallory was at the hospital , but she had said I might call . She was expecting me , a148149I arrived at Paddington early and had a first-class compartment to myself , but it filled before we started . Something about those five other masked faces , buried in their evening newspapers and magazines , at last landed me back in England : that chosen isolation , that hatred of the other , as if we were all embarrassed at having to share our means of travel , even though it was first-class , with someone else . When we drew out of the station the elderly woman opposite me glanced up at the ventilation window . It was slightly open . A minute later she glanced again . I said , Shall I shut it ? ' Oh well if ... ' I stood and shut it ; and received a frozen grimace , meant to represent gratitude , from the lady and two or three covertly disapprovingexaminations from my male fellow-passengers . I had committed the cardinal sin not of shutting the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world who arc so certain that public decency and good breeding is silence ; or who by carrying it to such lengths create such an impression of tribal homogeneity ... I was wearing clothes bought in California , a polo-necked jumper and sports jacket , not a suit and tie , and perhaps they read somethingalien in me  --  a danger , someone to be taught the English way . I did n't really disapprove of it ; I noted it , like an anthropologist , and understood it , as an Englishman . Being forced to share a confinedspace with people to whom you have not been introduced was an activity dense with risk : one might be held to ransom and forced to give some item of information about oneself . Perhaps it was just a matter of accent : a terror of revealing , in even the smallest phrase , one 's class , or some dissonance between voice and clothes , opinion and vowel-sound . It disturbed me far more than usual , that absolutely normal English silence . It seemed not relaxed at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it seemed so characteristic of my own past  --  and of the family I was re-entering . I had analysedIsothis fear of exposure , this onanistic fondling of privacy , long before ; once used it successfully in a play ; but its persistence baffled me . It went marching on through the youth and the sexual revolutions : through the permissive society , swinging London and all the rest , Hide , hide , hide , hide . Of course it was nothing , in that train : simply six middle-class people wanting to be left alone . But its private transference to a personal world , its murderous use as a killer of tolerance and trust , as agapicide , had principally ruined my marriage . We had used our silences like sabres , in the end . Dan and Nell decided , perhaps in reaction to the other menage 's philoprogenitiveness , not to have children for at least a year . There were  --  or so they argued  --  economic reasons . He had to see how his dramatic first-born would be received , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to London . Nell need n't have worked , but of the two sisters she was at that tune much closer to the then uniormulated ideas of Women 's Liberation . Of course it was partly pretending : we both had private income , indeed togetherjust about enough not to have needed to work at all . If we had money troubles , then as later , it was because we were born squanderers  --  Dan in reaction to his upbringing , Nell in conformity with hers . Neither of us ever showed anything but a very intermittentskill at economizing . The Empty Church , the play that attempted to exorcise my father 's ghost from my life , came on . It received fair to good reviews , benefiting a little from the charity traditionally extended to new names . It had rather a slow start at the box-office , but then picked up . Dan had his first real publicity . I suppose he ought to have seen a red light then : Nell was far more emotional , manicdepressiveabout it , than he was . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it justified , if one 's going to copy IbsenPI one has no business with melodramatic tricks ) as a personal affront ... almost as if what was under attack was her choice in marrying the playwright . She was stupidly rude one evening at a party  --  they had just moved to London  --  to the New Statesman drama critic . He had n't even given the play a bad review , merely spelt out some reservations . That spawned their first serious row , when they got home . It did n't last long , she cried and they made love . Dan evenIs ' had to stop her writing a letter of apology the next day . At the tin he put it down to over-identification . In reality it was a first declare tion of career jealousy . What had finally brought them to London was not only th modest success of the play , but the quite unexpected arrival of film-script offer .

He was also having problems with his next play . I can ' pretend that he hesitated , and Nell was for it . The well-known an , profoundly ungifted British producer who had bought the boo flattered him in the manner of his kind and they both happil ; swallowed that as well . At one point they seemed to be seeing a nev film every evening  --  and tearing its script to bits afterwards o trying to pick up lessons from it . Dan read the movie-tnakinl classics and had the usual love-affaire with the professional jargon  --  all that bastard attempt to direct on paper which every decen scenarist in the history of the business has always run a mile fromNell found herself a job soon afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial position with the same publishers who were to re-enter my life later in the form of Caro ' ; rejected beau .

The pay was criminally poor , barely covered the money she spent on clothes , and nothing serious was sent her way But she was allowed to work largely at home and she and Dan werc still dewy-eyed enough to think that that compensated for the exploitation and the drudgery . They took turns at the same typewriter . All this was in a tiny mews flat they had found near the Brompton Road , before SW3 had achieved its current chic and crippling prices . It was a happy enough winter . Jane had Rosamund , without problems , and Dan and Nell became the baby 's godparents . They still saw quite a lot of Anthony and Jane , either at Wytham or when they came down to London . Dan had by then realized that152amount of dialogue improvement could hide the basic silliness of I story , but the first draft he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a typical British film production : a bad idea in the first ( place , done on the cheap from top to bottom , and based on the Legitimate assumption that the great British cinema-going public had no taste and the illegitimate one that only water divided the United Kingdom from the United States . In the novel the hero had been English , but American interest ' had killed that from the start  --  not that it would have made any difference to the two hours ofk rubbish that eventually hit the odeons . It took some years for Dan to realize that the total failure in England to develop a decent commercial movie industry , let alone something better than a constipated trickle of serious film-makers , 11*is at least partly due to our unerring flair for backing bad directors ... or to the corollary notion that some semi-illiterate cameraman or ingratiating phony must know more about reproducing life than anyone else . He should have learnt from that first director , who hadlb merely managed to fawn his way into the grand conspiracy of mediocrity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all this is in retrospect . Dan did a second draft , was drawn into the first fringes of the celluloid world  --  like a foolish shrimp into a sea anemone . Already feelers were out about another script , and he was beginning to see his way through with the new play . Writing that became a great relief after the script , so much so that he insidiously argued himself into believing there was a creative as well as an economic argument for following both professions . Even Nell had a promotion of sorts  --  to proof-reading . She had an unusual feminine ability to be meticulously accurate in punctuation and spelling , something else she did not pass on to Caro . The appallingness of her written English was one of the few things they were able to agree on in later years . But by this time , the spring of 1952 , faint rifts in the lute were already appearing . Dan had to be on hand while they shot the indoor scenes  --  there were very few locations , it was all being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already Nell had begun to complain about the excitement ' of Dan 's life and the153dullness ' of hers .

He had taken , even before shooting began , to doing some o the rewrites at the office in Wardour Street . Ile was given a miser. able little cubbyhole there , but he now found it easier to write awa ) from Nell . Perhaps it was partly embarrassment at having , at home her read what lie wrote ; but even with the play ... she was alway hovering over it , wanting to see each scene the moment it came of the typewriter . That began to irritate Dan  --  unfairly , she was trying to cling to the joint existence . As he worked away from home more , so did she ; correcting proofs at the publishers , making friends will : her fellow-editors . In spite of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her first silences germinated there . Increasinglyhe was late home . At this stage the blame is almost all Dan 's . The work Nell did wa ; pettifogging and monotonous , especially for a graduate with a better degree than he had managed to get himself . He was doing exactly what he wanted ( not the same as he really needed ) and she was marking galleys and time . He had also fallen a victim of the glamours and vulgarities of his new world  --  however disparagingly he might talk of it with people like Jane and Anthony . The commercial cinema is like a hallucinogenic drug : it distorts the vision of all who work in it . What is at stake behind the public scenes is always personal power and prestige , which reduce the industry to a poker-table where every player must , ifhe is to survive , become some kind of professional cheat , or hustler . Success is always with the two-faced ; and one can no more enter the game innocently ( though Dan did his best ) than a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its madams , pimps , whores and bullies masquerade publicly as distinguished ' directors and stars , famous producers and agents , simply shows how much there is to hide . It can not be an art , in this form . No art could so invariably prefer the crook to the honest man , the Tartuffe to the plain-speaker , the mediocrity to the genius , accountancy to all aesthetic and moral principle ; could install a debased argument from populism , panderingto the lowest common denominator , at its heart . One day historywill ask why so few truly adult films were ever made in the154t s. countries with the most opportunities ; what fatal reaction it ss Is in the forced marriage between the Jewish and the Anglo-.1 ion race-minds that generated so much corrupt shimmer , and so little real substance ; and why such a hugely disproportionate atnount of the lasting proof that the cinema can be an art , and a very great one , has come from countries outside the English-speaking world .

She became a course all self-respecting West Coast studs had to have played over at least once .

But only a producer as gormless and a director as sycophantic as the ones the film had would ever have cast her as the emotion-torn upper-class WAAF officer she was suppo , sedto be playing .

She did seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried desperately to act . That generally made her performance even worse , but she was a trouper , in her fashion . She was also the first woman Dan had met whose reputation was based purely on her sexuality . He began to realize of ter a week or two that for some reason she preferred his company to that of most other people around the stage . She was getting a fair amount of publicity build-up and Dan had to spend some time doing last-minute rewrites , but when they were both idle they took to chatting together . He used to tease her a little ; innocuously , and she was too dumb to be dry back , but she liked having her pin-up image gently mocked . It gave her the illusion that she could see through it . This type of non-actress always craves the nearest tame **25;4652;TOOLONG : I know that now and that it is n't really the wistful modesty the more skilled practitioners can make it seem but just an155indispensable adjunct of big tits ... like the dress cleft to the sternum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no more humane than when Circe asked Ulysses up for a drink  --  or those of Delilah turned barber . Not that Dan 's motives were humane of course ; he was simply , if unconsciously , looking for a personification of all he felt seducing him elsewhere . She had met Nell , she knew Dan was married ; she must also have known that she disturbed him physically . It came to the point when he knew he could have her for the asking . The day before a free day on her schedule , she asked him to drop by ' if he was in town and anywhere near her Curzon Street flat . He had said he must be at the studio . Too bad , she murmured ; and her heavily ironic eyes said the rest . I do n't know what it was : whether mere lust or some perverse need to prove to myself that success ' was the highest moral good instead of ordinary human decency ; whether it was Nell 's increas- ingly frequent sulks and moods ; whether it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then had become a proof that wild selfishness can be got away with ... and echo tenderly , poeti- tally , secretly  --  while Nell could still remain nice , when she chose , to come home to . At the time I blamed the last most : Jane . The shooting was almost finished before it happened . Dan had stopped going to Pinewood and was working on the final revisions of The Red Barn . Nell had gone to her office to proof-read . Just before midday the telephone rang . That voice . Circe claimed she had a script she wanted Ulysses to read , if he was free for lunch ... Dan suddenly found both ropes and mast were imaginary . He took a taxi , went to Curzon Street , and screwed her . To be exact , he had not gone with that definitely in mind ; but his usually inventive imagination had failed for once . The door had been opened by an already naked girl . He could only have turned and walked away . Many years later he met her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner party . She was more famous , or in- famous , by then , and perhaps she was being discreet ; but he had the impression that she had completely forgotten that they had ever been to bed together . It had been done in silence , at some length ; she had proved better at sex than at acting ; and it had happened only that once . Deep X56 . it , wn it confirmed his experience with Jane , though this time the dialogue about whether there was to be a future was cut down to two or three lines .

He took it away withand probably she expected him to bring it back and claim rc.uling fees . Instead he talked about it with her over the telephone and returned it by post . She did n't seriously object when he killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaved as she was , beneath the dramatic pretensions : a sporting amateur , and satisfied Ss soon as flesh had trumped brains . I must n't dismiss this too lightly ; the cynicism came later . Dan left the flat feeling stunned with self-shock ; and I remember he had a miserable afternoon . He wandered across Hyde Park and ended up , heaven knows why , in the Geological Museum ; perhaps because it was devoted to the non-human . Then he sat for an hour or more in a pub , even though he knew Nell would probably be home before him and he would have to invent some alibi . In fact she stayed on Tate to finish a set of proofs and he was given ample time to collect his wits and his damaged mask . It was very clear to him that he had done something wicked and that he must not let it happen again . Ilut of course he had graduated ; with Jane there had been a deeply suppressed but mutually recognized feeling , a justifying sense of uniqueness , of enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a springboard to higher , nobler things : to the life she now led , in fact . But now he had done it with a slut , not only in a brothel decor but in a brothel way ; only the money had been missing . He underwentthe usual sequence of guilt and self-justification  --  he had been trapped by Nell , he needed freedom ... by which he principally meant , though he hardly admitted it to himself , the freedom to exploit his growing success . So Nell became a foolishly high premium he had paid to insure against failure in life , both sexual and professional . He had long known he was not unattractive to women , but the adventure in Curzon Street went to his head after the first shock of it . He decided he must be very attractive  --  and I use must ' in both its descriptive and prescriptive sense . He adopted the disgustinghabit of trying out this charm much more consciously thanbefore . Always well out of Nell 's sight , of course . He told himself it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little recompense , since outwardly he did try quite hard for a while to be more concerned for Nell . In July he handed in the finished version of The Red Barn to his new agent , waited to have his first reaction ( warm and excited ) , then drove off with her for a holiday in France . They idled down to Provence , eked out four weeks there , then idled back . It was a success from the start : the weather , the food , the countryside , the sex , the suddenly discussiblefeeling that they had drifted apart during those previous months . Dan telephoned back to London from Avignon ; both theatre producers who had by then read the play wanted it ... he and Nell had the most expensive dinner of their then lives that evening , and came to other decisions over it . Nell would stop workingand go in for motherhood , they would find a bigger flat or a small house as soon as they got back . However , that was delayed beyond the three weeks  --  Nell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of resignation from a drowsy little port , charmingly free of the vulgar mob , called St Tropez . I think Dan might at some point during that happy month have confessed to the Curzon Street coupling , but he had some buried terror as to how confession might then run on ; or he clung to his secrets . In truth he remained intensely selfish . But the sun gave Nell a new body , contraceptives were abandoned , the heat made them both continuously randy ... if he still surreptitiously eyed other female bodies , it was without envy . They ran out of money ( both permitted and illegal ) and had to make do on the way back with flea-pits and cheaper and cheaper picnic meals ; but even that had been fun . For months afterwards the experience remained their true honeymoon ; and not only because Nell proved to have conceivedfirst time round . What the holiday also proved , alas , was that they could be happy ( as at Oxford ) only in the unreal , not the real . But neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , if not genuinely new , at least fresh . It was probably lucky that I had only the sketchiest notion at the time of what Brecht was getting at . I came on the idea by pure chance , happening one day to pick up a contemporary account of the William Corder trial . All Maria Marten had meant to me beforewas the type exemplar of ham rural fustian . But I saw at once that there was an entertaining historical play to be disinterred . It had taken me some time to realize that William was the central character , not Maria ; and I did take enormous pains over the dialogue . But the play 's success was a team job : it had the best series of sets of its year , five fat and a number of good small parts . The cattle were with it from the start . The anatomy of first major success is like the young human body , a miracle only the owner can fully savour ... and even then , only at the time . Dan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of smug euphoria , well above the flak from minor setbacks . The only serious professional disappointment was the failure to get a New York production going ; but in the New Year the play went on in Sweden and West Germany , with negotiations for rights in progress with several other countries . The private clouds on the horizon did not seem very important at the time . Though the 99-year lease I bought of the Notting Hill flat was probably the best business deal I ever did , unaided , in my life , Dan and Nell began having doubts as soon as they moved in . It was partly that miserable drive to keep up with the Joneses that is endemic in the show-business world . They started to feel they had quite unnecessarily undersold themselves . The sort of people they now began to mix with all lived in so much nicer surroundings  --  and so much more stylishly above their income , in many cases . They had seen small houses  --  in St John 's Wood , in Islington , in Fulham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wytham . A cottage there was on the market and they secretly hankered after that at the same time as they found a dozen reasons for its impossibility . For the first time in his life Dan now had an accountant : the cost of the lease in London meant they could not sanely afford the price of the cottage . Everything in the new home had finally to come from Heal 's and they ran up huge bills . That did not prevent Nell from frequently blaming him later for not buying what they could not afford . She had a tetchy pregnancy and took increasingly against the flat . One day it would be too large , the next it was mad ' not having realized a garden for the baby ought to have been the priority . Increasingly she resented being left alone , increasingly she harked158 I
