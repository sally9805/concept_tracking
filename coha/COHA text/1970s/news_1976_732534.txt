txt A wide range of legal tools is fast coming to the aid of pornography foes , according to a Monitor survey . This year could mark a fall in the rising porno trade , note many community leaders nationwide , for four reasons : ? Many old obscenity laws are being updated to aid prosecutors who need precise definitions of indecency . Since a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling , states and communities have been free , with some restrictions , to regulate material not conforming to local obscenity standards . As a result , more juries now return verdicts of guilty against pornographers based on well-defined community standards rather than fuzzy national norms as in pre-1973 cases . ? New zoning laws , represented by the method of dispersing sex shops within a community or , instead , " containing " them , are gaining wide use and attention . By June 30 , the Supreme Court is expected to decide whether zoning used in Detroit to separate residential areas from porno dealers is lawful . Others are studying Boston 's 1974 zoning policy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat zone . " ? Growing community intolerance for hard-core pornography , from New York 's Times Square to rural drive-ins , is producing more court prosecutions and citizen protests for action . // * Pornography foes gain allies , weapons // ? A variety of legal maneuvers , including tough building codes , loitering laws , and policewomen posing as prostitutes , are being tested in many U.S. cities as indirect ways to combat smut and sex dealers . Other recent developments point to porno 's plight . In April , the biggest nationwide police action of its kind ended in conviction of 16 national distributors for the movie " Deep Throat " following a 9-week , 90-witness trial . In June a National Obscenity Law Center opens in New York City to assist any courtroom prosecutor who needs help against the well-trained lawyers who defend smut dealers . While in Congress , pending S 1 , the Senate bill that would codify U.S. criminal law , also would rewrite and tighten U.S. pornography laws . The Detroit case now before the Supreme Court will decide whether a city can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of certain areas . Detroit officials are also beefing up code-inspection teams to investigate bookstores and other establishments serving as fronts for prostitution . In Boston a zoning code forbids new " adult entertainment " establishments anywhere in the city except in a two-block section . Officials say it has stopped the spread of honky-tonk bars , so-called " art " cinemas , and X-rated bookstores to other parts of the city . Other cities , such as Minneapolis , are watching both Boston 's experiment and the outcome of the Detroit Supreme Court case . The city paid for some upgrading ( trees , benches ) of its " combat zone " area , which adjoin a major bus terminal , Chinatown , the legitimate theater district , and the main business district . In New York City , however , city officials six months ago launched a campaign to clean up the Times Square area with the help of $432,000 in federal funds . Several new approaches make this effort different from previous attempts : a City Hall task force , backed by genuine outpodring of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution , has been formed to bring the pressure of 20 city agencies on the porno establishments . In the past three months , there have been some 20 unannounced raids on strip shows ? with a new twist . A judge is brought along to make on-the-spot rulings . A new city zoning law prohibits any new massage parlor from opening with fewer than 200 rooms and an Olympic-size swimming pool . No new parlors have opened , but there has been no impact on the existing 63 massage parlors in the Midtown area . Many cities are trying new ways to rid themselves of massage parlors . In Chicago , a new ordinance requiring city licensing help cut the number of parlors from 40 to 5 , according to city police . In Washington , D.C. , a new ordinance barring massages by members of the opposite sex has helped close 33 parlors . In Berkeley , California , where some two dozen massage parlors have been advertising with suggestive pictures in underground newspapers , an ordinance passed by the City Council in late 1973 required licensing of parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towns use nuisance laws . Last March the California Supreme Court upheld such a technique . " It 's a tool , but not a cure-all , " says Richard Helgeson , of the Los Angeles attorney 's office .
