Foreign autos now account for one out of every seven new-car sales in the U.S. To fight the inroads of the imports , Detroit 's two largest automakers last week put their much remarked mini-car models on sale . Both General Motors and Ford waited until the last minute to set sticker prices for the new lines . The biggest surprise was the price of Chevrolet 's Vega 2300 , which turned out to be about $150 higher than that of a comparable Ford Pinto and about $190 higher than that of the cheapest Volkswagen . <P> The basic list price of the Vega 2300 is $1,950 , which ( with federal excise tax and dealer preparation ) comes out to $2,091 for a two-door sedan , $2,197 for a " hatchback " coupe , and $2,329 for a station wagon . Frequently requested options-such as automatic transmission ( $111 ) , deluxe interior ( $125.95 ) and power steering ( $95 ) - can rapidly raise the Vega 's price to more than $2,500 . The Pinto , which comes in only one model , a two-door sedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dealer preparation charges . Volkswagen 's 60-h.p. basic beetle sells for $1,899 . <P> The main reason for the Vega 's unexpectedly high cost is weight ; it is 383 Ibs. heavier than a VW , 177 Ibs. heavier than the Pinto and 300 Ibs. heavier than G.M. originally intended . As the car evolved , its designers made myriad little changes intended to improve the car 's appearance , road performance or safety . At 170 in. , the Vega is 7 in. longer than the Pinto and has a 90-h.p. engine compared with Pinto 's 75-h.p. power plant . <P> " The secret for beating Volkswagen is quality , " says Chevrolet General Manager John Z. DeLorean . Pinto and Vega offer newer styling and better handling characteristics than the Volkswagen . The cheaper Pinto reflects Ford 's conviction that VW must also be met head-on in terms of price . <P> Foreign automen insist that they will withstand the challenge . G.M. and Ford each hope to sell 400,000 of their minicars during the new model year . Volkswagen predicts that its sales will rise by 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell a combined total of 250,000 cars to U.S. customers . Unless the market for subcompacts expands faster than most analysts anticipate , somebody is likely to be disappointed .
