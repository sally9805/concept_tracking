February 27,1973 <P> " Today is my birthday , that seemingly milestone year of forty-five . But it does not seem a milestone at all to me . I see no great dividing line in my life unless it is the day we do the inevitable and send Noah away . The other night I told Karl we might have to find a place for Noah soon . " I like Noah , " Karl said . " He can always stay in my room . " <P> January 7,1975 <P> At this point let me be honest with myself : What is my attitude toward Noah ? How do I view him ? I think , put simply , I view him as a responsibility , someone I have to take care of-almost like a job that has to be done . Because if we do n't do the job , who will ? It 's our job by elimination . And I mean job , just a job . I am no Job and Noah is no great affliction and neither of us is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How I love Noah . A love beyond sex . A love beyond need . A love based on service . A love in fact . He can be so endearing-putting his face up to mine to be kissed . I guess every pet has its wiles . But he is my pet .
