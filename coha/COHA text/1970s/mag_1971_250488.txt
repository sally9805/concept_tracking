Disclosure of this information could endanger the lives of or cause other serious harm to persons engaged in investigative activities on behalf of the United States . Disclosure of national defense information could injure the United States and give aid to foreign governments whose interests might be inimical to those of the United States . <P> The statement , issued by U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell , reflected his deep concern-and considerable embarrassment-over a serious breach in the FBI 's security measures . On the night of March 8 , a group calling itself the Citizen 's Commission to Investigate the FBI broke into the bureau 's unguarded two-man office in Media , Pa. , and stole at least 800 secret documents . Copies of 16 of these documents , which deal primarily with the bureau 's surveillance of radical black and student groups , were forwarded to places where the thieves thought they would do the most good-or harm , as it were , to the FBI . Among the recipients : liberal Columnist Tom Wicker of the New York Times , the Washington Post , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Parren Mitchell , a black Democrat from Maryland . <P> Suspect Boy Scouts . There was a strong suspicion that the theft was in some way connected to the case of the Berrigan brothers , the Catholic priests accused of conspiring to kidnap Henry Kissinger and blow up Government property . The Media office is part of the FBI 's Philadelphia division , which is handling the Berrigan investigation . Three days after the theft , Haverford Professor William Davidon , named as a co-conspirator in the Berrigan case , revealed the name of the raiding group before a gathering of clergymen and gave his unabashed approval of the theft . <P> Beyond that , one of the stolen documents dealt with a Moscow , Idaho , Boy Scout leader named Thomas Ingerson who had requested visas from the Soviet embassy for his troop to make a Russian tour this summer . Another file contained a directive from FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover , saying in part : " Increased campus disorders involving black students pose a definite threat to the nation 's stability and security and indicate need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . concerning such groups which are targets for influence and control by the violence-prone Black Panther party and other extremists . " <P> Although a harsh critic of FBI surveillance techniques , Senator McGovern quickly returned his copies to the Justice Department , saying he refused to be linked with " this illegal action by a private group " and adding that the burglary hampered " reasonable and constructive efforts to secure appropriate public review " of bureau activities .
