Newswatch Thomas Griffith <P> Washington is full of names that make news and of news that is made anonymously by the very same people . This arrangement , convenient to all sides , can also be worrisome . Much of the punditry of Washington columnists and the daily run of informed content in newspapers , newsmagazines and on the air is based on anonymity . A Deep Throat may happen along only once in a decade , but in Washington a lot of shallow throats and wagging tongues are in action all the time . <P> Insiders get good at deciding who could have said what , particularly when anonymity operates by understood code names : a " senior State Department official aboard the Secretary 's plane " used to mean Henry Kissinger , and now means Cyrus Vance . A diplomat or bureaucrat can privately get across his side of an argument , or an explanation of policy , while publicly stating his position in Saran Wrapped platitudes . Not wanting to be used , reporters constantly labor to get off-the-record statements put back on the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , but do n't pin it on me " ) . When mutual trust has been established-the one convinced he will not be misquoted , the other that he will not be misled-a lot of important information has become public . <P> The temptations to cheat with anonymous quotes are many , however , and skeptical readers invariably give them less weight . In the wrong reporter 's hands , the use of anonymous quotes can be a lazy device , enabling him to imply that he has talked to a higher authority than he really has . At worst , without putting his own good name at risk , an official may be floating a trial balloon , scoring off a rival or planting wrong information . The bargain may seem an evenhanded one-my increased candor in exchange for your protecting my identity-but it is n't . A strange transference takes place : the responsibility for the authenticity of what is said shifts from the speaker to the person who prints and guarantees it . Editors ca n't live without the unnamed authority but are n't happy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to business reporting , where inside information is bound to be profitable to somebody . So when reporters are blocked by what they think to be a company 's official evasions , they often seek the real dope from securities analysts and other market watchers , who follow an industry 's doings with sharpened curiosity and considerable knowledge . But the danger and the injustice of using anonymous sources is well illustrated by a New York Times story of Nov. 14. about the appointment of John J. Nevin as the new president of Firestone Tire &; Rubber Co . Earlier he had headed Zenith Radio Corp. , the country 's largest manufacturer of color television sets .
