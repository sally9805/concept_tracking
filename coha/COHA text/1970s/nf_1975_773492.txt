txt ri THE PLAYGROUP MOVEMENT playgroup , kept until bed-time ; the widower is invited into supper each evening ; his shopping , washing , cooking and cleaning are done for him . The sympathetic wife responds to this practical need and fails to see where it is leading . The husband grows anxious about his wife 's increasing fatigue , but does not like to say anything in case she takes it the wrong way ' , and the widower can become emotionally dependent upon the family . Help needs to be given carefully if the child and his father are to be set upon the road to a new family relationship based on their own home . CHILDREN IN RESIDENTIAL CARE As with the short-term foster children , those who will be in residential care only briefly will usually be more secure if they stay in their own environment , and enjoy the play facilities on the premises . Children likely to be in care for longer periods have special needs which are difficult for the staff to meet . The staff have to be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children losing the feeling that they matter to any one person in particular . However well run , an institution is not as intimate as a home ; with the best will in the world , it is difficult for the staff to find time for a leisurely conversation with an individual child . Playgroups can help in two ways . Local mothers can collect some of the three- and four-year-olds and take them to join their playgroup . It is a change of scene , an outing , a chance to make new friends , discover new toys and activities , make new relationships with mother-figures . Friendships can lead to invitations to visit local homes , where the children can recapture the feeling of a home and family . One of the tragedies of these children is that sometimes they are adopted ' by visiting aunties ' who make much of them for a while ? and then forget to visit or take them out or send them cards . In a playgroup setting the child does not become so emotionally dependent on any one mother ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally without being unsettled . // If there are no local playgroups it may be possible for visiting mothers to create a playgroup in the Home . The playroom will almost certainly be equipped and already in use , but the advent of mothers from outside could be a welcome change , bringing new faces , new names , new clothes to look at and touch , new stories to hear , new songs to sing . This situation may also lead to visits to local homes ; and it would be safe ' to love such regular visitors as the playleader and her helpers . PART III ACCOMMODATION There are now several playgroups involving mothers and children in temporary residential care , and there need to be more , for sometimes the period of care is over a year . The morale of the mothers can be very low , and in this distressed state of mind tensions mount as mothers try to share cookers and laundry facilities . Sometimes the mothers are poor managers , with little understanding of children even at the basic level of how to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are not fundamentally inadequate , and their fortitude and abilities need to be called into use , both for their own sakes and that of the community in which they find themselves . Almost always an outside helper is needed to enthuse and guide the mothers into starting their own playgroup , and she may well have to run the play sessions herself to provide the continuity and the example of how it 's done ' . Some of the mothers are so burdened by five children under five that all they ask is that two or three shall be removed for a few hours ; sometimes they are eager for the stimulation of working with a lively adult who has the gift of making everybody feel wanted and needed ; sometimes they enjoy learning new skills ? one such derived great satisfaction from learning to crochet . Many of these mothers feel pushed around ' and the last thing they want is people drafted in to make them more adequate ; yet some have shown a real aptitude for learning when their interest was roused through friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are at such a low ebb that it would be unreasonable to expect them to feel concern // about their children 's intellectual development . Concern for the children is the playgroup leader 's personal problem in the early days , but as they adjust to a good play environment and become easier to manage , the mothers ' interest is aroused . In a similar situation would we not clutch at anything that seemed to work ' where handling children was concerned ? One of the most noteworthy features of a good playgroup is the ability of the mother to respond to a good playgroup leader , and copy all that she says and does . And copying is sometimes the first step in real learning . 52 Chapter 3 Parent involvement Parent involvement is one of the most significant and valuable developments to emerge from the playgroup movement , and it could be the greatest potential of the playgroups of the future . The benefit to both parents and children is already clearly apparent in new towns , overspill towns , council estates , private housing estates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOES IT WORK ? Today 's young parents are under tremendous pressures as television , films , magazines and advertising set unrealistic standards and expectations . Many mothers are not much more than children themselves ; many are strained by living with parents or in-laws , or lonely because they have moved away from their families ; many can enjoy their first baby , but can not cope at all once the second and subsequent babies arrive ; many are so deprived themselves that their own needs conflict with the constant demands of a family . Other mothers are able to cope more adequately , and they set their sights higher ; they strive to live graciously ' , be Cordon Bleu cooks , have lively minds ' , and achieve bliss in bed . But now , with all the modern knowledge about the crucial importance of the first five years of life , society is in danger of making them feel that they are not good enough to bring up their own children . For many mothers , having a baby is the first time in their lives when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anybody ; this confidence needs to be reinforced and used as a new growing point if the gap is not to be widened between the parents and their children . There is a danger of // children being increasingly ministered to by experts now that the crucial importance of these early years is recognized . Playgroups offer the possibility of bringing together mothers and children , in order that they shall both have support and stimulation . Where a child has missed out it is often because his parents missed out before him , and they simply do not know what good parents should say , and do , and provide . During these years of talking with mothers in playgroups it has become quite clear to me that many mothers , once they see and hear what goes on in a good playgroup , can and do go home and r ' start to put it into practice . It is not true that the mothers can not and will not learn . On the contrary , all that many of them need is a living example to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-class job of bringing up their families but they , too , often derive great comfort and stimulus from being in the playgroup . Many of them set themselves such high standards that they feel strained and near breaking point ; it is a relief to meet others in the same situation , and to discover that what seemed to be a unique and worrying problem is common to many mothers at this stage . It is disturbing to find such a high incidence of maternal depression . The deliberately light-hearted query , Am I the only one who can remember real flashes of panic lest I was going round the bend ? ' brings forth a gale of laughter from open meetings , playgroup course sessions , or informal groups . It is not the laughter of amusement , but of relief at finding a hidden experience shared . People will come up afterwards or wait outside to say , You do n't know what a relief it was to know that other people had been through it . ' Other mothers who benefit are those who feel frustrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really not done for middle-class mothers to go out to work ; now we have reached the stage where it is almost not done to stay at home . Possibly the accepted knowledge that as much as fifty per cent of a child 's intelligence is developed in the first four years of life will give these child-bound years a new status . Perhaps the monotony of the daily routine will slip into the background , compared with the creativity of laying the foundations of a unique human being . Meanwhile , it helps if those finding it more than difficult to adapt to a maternal role can share their // frustration , and often their guilt . The playgroup and its allied activities offer a creative outlet that works wonders for their morale , and begins to give them back a feeling of identity . Other mothers are lonely or shy , and the playgroup provides a neighbourhood meeting point . Again and again I hear that the first thing a couple do when they move to a new area is to get in touch with the nearest playgroup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marvellous ! ' The children need the presence of men in their predominantly feminine world , and more and more playgroup leaders are inviting men into the playgroups ? policemen , firemen , milkmen , grandfathers , husbands on shiftwork . Saturday Fathers ' Days are just beginning to catch on ; the average man hates Saturday shopping , and husbands are beginning to discover that they can run a playgroup with a minimum of help while wives shop or cook . But there are warning signs too . Sometimes husbands feel threatened as they see their wives begin to grow in stature , discovering resources within themselves about which they were previously unaware . If the husbands are also involved , then the growth is parallel . If they are not , then they can suffer severe loss of confidence ; or , alternatively , they can ( and do ) assert themselves by refusing to allow their wives to continue , either with the playgroup or the playgroup courses . HOW CAN IT BE ENCOURAGED ? It will spread only as people understand the need for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say , We do n't need mothers on a rota , we find we can manage better without them . ' It comes as a surprise if the answer is I 'm sure you can manage without them ? but have you ever wondered if they can manage without you ? ' Once this idea has been introduced , motherinvolvement sometimes follows . Many playgroup leaders feel that they would like to try the idea , but do not know how to switch from one system to another . Sometimes a playgroup leader calls a meeting and puts it to the mothers , who are often caught up by her enthusiasm and respond gladly . Sometimes the beginning is more cautious ; a start is made by a spontaneous act of kindness ? a husband // leaves home , a child dies , a demanding relative living at home reduces the young mother to tears of exasperation , and the playgroup leader says , Come and spend the morning with us . ' And from this point on it can grow . New groups often have no clear idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation system is explained they like the sound of it , and decide to start this way . IS IT ALWAYS POSSIBLE ? No , not without more understanding and support than is available at the moment ; some playgroup leaders are frightened of domination by the more aggressive mothers in their community and stirring speeches about the value of motherinvolvement are useless . Regular supportive visits are needed at frequent intervals . In many areas the social services , educational and playgroup advisers work closely with the voluntary area organisers to try to ensure that each playgroup has the visits , and visitors , that it needs . Some women are splendid with children but become selfconscious with other adults present and can not face a rota system . Sometimes a playgroup leader discovers that she has no patience with adults , although she may be endlessly patient with children . Sometimes her own personality is such that other mothers find her difficult to get on with in other ways . Sometimes the mothers in a particular area do not respond to a particular playgroup leader who would be warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing as she is to try , the mothers just do not rise to responsibility . The worry of never knowing whether or not the rota mothers are going to turn up on their particular morning becomes too much , and three or four stalwarts decide to carry the playgroup between them . Very occasionally participation is rendered virtually impossible by the requirements that every mother ( even if she is only on the rota one or two mornings a term ) must have a chest X-ray , and fill in a long and detailed medical form . The X-ray is no hardship in a town , or where a mobile van is available , but in some country districts the journey into the nearest town is long and expensive , with a young brood in tow . Sometimes // the playgroup has different children on different days , and seventy mothers may apply for X-rays , only to be told that the hospital is unable to cope with this number . Sometimes private arrangements then have to be made , at a cost of up to ? 3.15 . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant must certainly be X-rayed , but that the infrequent mother-helper is no more of a hazard than the local shopkeeper or visiting friend . The health forms deter for rather different reasons ; some ask if there is any family history of mental illness , and both embarrassment and anxiety are aroused as mothers remember Uncle Herbert 's suicide or old Aunt Jayne 's spell in a psychiatric ward . Husbands sometimes refuse to co-operate , saying that this is an unwarranted intrusion into privacy , bearing in mind that a rota mother is at no time in charge of the children , and that she may only be with them for eight or nine hours a term . Sometimes the struggle to explain , reason and coax on all sides grows too much for the playgroup leader , and she takes the easiest way out and abandons the idea of involving the parents . Surely this is a pity ? WHAT CONSTITUTES INVOLVEMENT ? No one running a valuable playgroup for children should feel inadequate or guilty about the fact that she is not also involving parents on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now like to become a community playgroup but are n't sure if they could cope with the change-over , but to many the idea of having mothers in turn to be with the children throughout the morning is new and revolutionary , especially if they have been running private groups for many , many years , and they ask questions that need to be answered . Is n't there greater security for the children if I and my regular assistants are constant ? ' Possibly , but even an insecure child will find that two constant people give him the anchorage that he needs ; the more confident ones begin to learn about adults as a succession of extras ' present themselves , one or two at a time , in their own secure playgroup world . // Is it fair for parents to pay , and then for them to have unskilled staff ? ' It depends on what is understood by unskilled . Many mothers are highly gifted at story-telling , music , giving confidence and comfort to shy children , encouraging the diffident to talk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering the strengths of the various mothers , and encouraging them to develop their gifts to the full . The security of the regular playgroup leader and her helper will provide the atmosphere of the playgroup , the mothers can be delightful extras . Is it fair to ask the mothers to help ; do n't they need a rest from their children just for a few hours ? ' Each mother 's turn on the rota will only come round about every tenth playgroup day ; if the playgroup only runs twice a week then she will only attend about twice a term . If she comes so seldom is it worth coming at all ? ' Yes , for the comment heard most often is It 's lovely being with the children when you have n't got housework to bother about ? somehow at home I always get on with the chores and never really see what she 's doing at all . ' It is this introduction of a mother to the world of children and their play that is so valuable . Also , for many mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see just what sort of play material and books children enjoy . One mother new to playgroup said , My little girl has asked if she can have a lump of your pink stuff for Christmas , where do you get it ? ' It was flour mixed with water and cochineal . I like all my parents , but I just do n't feel I could ever cope with them on a rota-system . I 'm shy/bossy/prefer children to adults/ have n't got any more nervous energy to spare . Short of a rota system , is there anything else that I can do to help ? ' This playgroup leader is probably already offering her friendship , listening to their worries and sharing their interest in their children ; she is probably also aware of the importance of the mothers staying with their children initially until the child is ready to stay alone in the playgroup . ' Some may go on to arrange social evenings for the parents and see to it that newcomers are introduced to near neighbours and PARENT INVOLVEMENT others ; some arrange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or encourage parents to arrange for private coaches or mini-buses to take them and their children to the sea , the zoo , the country or the pantomime . Some have an eye for those who are lonely , and help them to feel wanted and needed by asking for help with such things as making dressing-up clothes , typing invitations or notices , washing the dolls ' clothes , or repairing books . It is not a question of How can I get this done on the cheap ? ' but rather What pretext can I find for bringing parents into satisfying personal contact with us and each other ? ' Are we being asked to change the way we run our groups ? ' It is no good feeling that we ought ' to change anything in response to pressure from outside . And no one should attempt to apply such pressure . No one should attempt to change for any reason other than a real desire to do so ; and even when this desire is present it is still important to be aware of the difficulties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who is being difficult ' when his mother is present , and when other mothers are watching ; but if the playgroup leader can manage it in such a way that neither the child nor his mother feels that they have been disgraced , then the mother may have been given the insight and courage to take similar action at home . Parent involvement offers a new dimension to working with children , and it would be quite unrealistic to suppose that all playgroup leaders are able to embark upon it ? or even that they wish to do so . All good play provision for children should be welcomed ; and all playgroup leaders should be credited with the desire to do as much for the children and their parents as they can do . It should be clearly understood that many playgroups which do not have a mother-rota system do involve parents deeply , and their playgroup is the centre of real community action . Conversely , some playgroups boasting a compulsory rota system may have mothers feeling that they have been pressganged rather than involved . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 4 Standard , style and value Most playgroup people warmly welcome visitors , especially those to whom they can turn for advice . Local playgroup advisers , nursery and infant advisers , health visitors , tutors , and above all , the voluntary area organizers of PPA visit by invitation ( the latter extensively ) . The playgroups are all so different that the first year of visiting can be bewildering . Whatever our age or training we all tend to measure our first few playgroups by the nursery schools we have worked in , by our own playgroups , or by the first good playgroups we visited . All other playgroups are then compared with our original model , and we tend to pronounce judgment , and to arrange them mentally , A is better than B , but not as good as C. ' It can take a long time for us to outgrow this judging attitude , but until we do we are not free to see each playgroup in its own unique setting . POPULAR MISCONCEPTIONS Many health visitors and social workers have proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as children have needs has enabled them to identify with the playgroup movement . The sensitivity that comes with years of visiting families in their homes is brought to bear as they-begin to visit a wide variety of playgroups . Often their sound common sense , allied to good observation , enables them to be of real value to playgroups . But sometimes they misjudge the situation . It is not unusual to hear Mrs X has hit upon such a splendid plan , she gives the children a good rush round when they arrive to let off steam , so that they 'll settle quietly later on . ' Others say , It 's a pleasure to go into Mrs Y 's group , all the children are // sitting around dear little tables , busy with their crayons and plasticine , and you could hear a pin drop . ' The balance between mind and body is a delicate one at this age , and neither the letting-off steam nor the quiet-as-mice technique can achieve the balance required for really absorbed creative play . Those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps , but we can easily fall into others . We can remember our long ago , pre-war nurseries , where we all cleared away for milk and biscuits , and then had music and story time for everybody : some of us even remember expecting children to need the lavatory simultaneously ; and when news-time was a must . We tend , at first , to approve of playgroups run on these lines , more than those run well on unstructured lines . Another trap into which we continually fall is overlooking the difference that mother-involvement makes to the situation , and in underestimating the complications caused by inadequate storage facilities . We may glibly say to a playgroup leader that the children must have books , forgetting that mothers who come from bookless homes will not see why ; and that even if this is explained they still do not know how to introduce children to books ; and if we do not show them what sort of books we are talking about , then the next visit may reveal a basket of books rescued from a jumble sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the mother helpers , and the Girls ' Annuals , Bumper Books and comics are presumed to have met the need we mentioned . Similarly , we explain that children should put away one thing before getting out another . It comes back to us later , via the grapevine , that the X playgroup was furious and said , Does n't she know that we do n't have cupboards ? ' We had assumed ( quite inaccurately and unreasonably ) that the playgroup leader would have said to the other mothers , She says the children ought to get out , and put back , their own things : so as we have n't cupboards let 's use that row of chairs as the depot for table toys during the play session ; and the children can help us pack everything into the suitcases , lettuce crates , plastic laundry basket , hospital trolley or storage chest at the end of the session . ' Once we visitors have seen our own failures it becomes easier to re-examine what we had thought were the failures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of balancing standard with style and value . STANDARD In considering the range of equipment , activities , and childadult relationships we should surely use the good nursery school as the ideal . With regard to the playgroup leader 's relationship with the mother helpers , the comparison may be inadequate in certain respects . Yet it is still helpful to have an ideal at which to aim , especially as so many playgroups can and do reach an extremely high standard by using this model , and then working out for themselves the intricacies of this extra dimension occasioned by parent involvement . Activities and equipment Ideally , when the children arrive the room will be prepared , and the playgroup leader will be waiting at the door to greet the children . Hall committees willing , and storage space permitting , the following activities will be awaiting the children ? water play ; wet and dry sand ; clay and/or dough ( as stuff to be manipulated ) ; woodwork ; painting ; well-equipped home corner complete with dressing-up clothes , and possibly dough for ' cooking ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys ; large junk from which to make cars , boats , etc ; climbing and balancing apparatus ; and tables offering an inviting selection of odds and ends , glue , scissors , etc. which encourage children to experiment freely and imaginatively , in two or three dimensions , combining several skills . There will also be the means available by which children can discover various sounds for themselves before music becomes more formal . A great deal of the child 's experience of these activities will be undertaken alone , as deeply personal discovery and experiment . But in addition to this freedom-to-discover , there needs to be opportunity-to-share with other children and with adults . These experiences may include story-telling ; music and movement ; singing , rhymes , and fingerplays ; the introduction of special interests such as flowers , leaves , fruit , vegetables , animals , insects , collections ( such as bottles , in different shapes , // sizes and colours ; or a variety of different objects all of one colour ) ; and conversation . In spite of shortage of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many playgroups reach such a high standard in all the above respects . Management of activities and children Naturally enough , it is more difficult to manage activities than to present them . It is also difficult to relate to children in a playgroup if you do not understand the real nature of play ; or if you know your own child , without knowing too much about the needs of children in general , and three- and four-yearolds in particular . It is in this sphere that playgroup people need more help , for the standard of management usually falls below that of provision of play opportunities . Most of the difficulty stems from the misinterpretation of free play , coupled with the fact that discipline seems to be a dirty word at present in our society . Free play is not the absence of any community rules , and a licence for all to do as they like . It means that the children are free to choose what they want to do ; free to do it for as long as they like ; and free to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free to pursue their own interests at the expense of other people . They should not be free to trail sand over the floor , because it would spoil the evening pleasure of the dancers or badminton players . They should not be free to scream , shout or make loud gun noises to the point where the other children suffer ( literally suffer ) from noise exhaustion . They should not be free to soak themselves , or others , at Water play , for parents worry about taking children home in wet clothes . They should not be free to tear books , bite puzzles , or break toys , for then subsequent users suffer . For obvious reasons no one should be free to hurt any other child , animal or property . Only in this framework of community rules can any child truly be free to learn by doing . Yet lack of the right sort of discipline is by no means the only threat to real free play . Through lack of understanding all too many playgroup leaders are inhibiting the innate creativity of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching . Frequently mothers will say to playgroup leaders , Do they only play ? I was hoping he 'd learn // something . ' Or , Do n't you teach them anything ? ' Or , My husband says it 's silly to pay for her just to play about , we 'd do better to spend the money to have her privately coached for the term before she goes to school . ' Or , Well , I 'd rather she went to Mrs X 's playschool down the road , where she 'll learn something . ' The idea is firmly ingrained in most adults that one only learns if one is taught . It is going to take great patience and skills , if we are to help people to understand that the experience of learning-to-learn has to be firmly established in a child before anyone should expect to teach him . And children can only accomplish this stage by being left free to repeat simple activities again and again and again . For example , one child spent weeks playing with wet sand , dry sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there came a day when she said , I like that sand ( dry silver sand ) , it 's all soft ; and I like water , water 's all soft , but the wet sand 's all horrid between my fingers . ' Why should two soft things mixed together not be soft ? She was not ready to ask such a question , but by handling and observation she was already learning about the properties of sand and water , and was able to put some of her discoveries into words . This is learningto-learn Playgroup leaders defeat the very thing they are trying to bring about if they teach children to make things before the children have had hours and hours of individual exploration in order to discover some of the properties of paper , paint , glue , clay , dough , wood , as stuff ' . Similarly , children are robbed of the chance to learn to make decisions for themselves if they are endlessly required to be pliable and responsive to orders . At first glance a playgroup may be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all busy , and the adult in charge may be delightful . Only slowly does one begin to register what is happening as one listens to the pleasant voice saying , Now , who has n't made an ashtray for Daddy yet ? Peter ! Come on , there 's a chair free now . Are you going to make a round one , or a square one ? ' John ! You 've had a long turn on that see-saw , what about Jane having a turn ? " Sarah ! What are you going to do ? Would you like to play with the sand ? No ? Well what about the water ? No ? Well , we must do something , must n't we ? // Come on , you come with me and we 'll look at a book . ' In the nicest possible way she is organizing everyone , until in the end they sit or stand passively , waiting to be told what to do . We mothers are all too apt to direct children : sit up straight ; eat it slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ; blow your nose ; do n't spill it ; run out to play ; put on your coat ; take off your boots . On and on we go at home . What a tragedy if children continue to be subjected to this pattern at the playgroup ! This might be the one place where a child can be certain that he is truly going to be free ( within the limit of community rules ) to choose what he wants do to ; to decide what to do next . Choice and decision are part of learning-to-learn , even if there is a decision to do nothing for a while . The management of difficult ' children Again , there is misunderstanding as people confuse a difficult child with a child that I find difficult to manage in the group ' . Often there is confusion over what is naughty ( deliberate ) and what is an accident . It is important to be able to see the difference , for learning-to-learn includes making mistakes , being helped to put things right , and helped to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playgroup leader is cross over an accident , or if she copes alone with the aftermath , the child is denied the opportunity to learn from this mistake ; and unless he is helped to understand and cope with a great many such accidents he will be unable to reach the stage of experience where he reacts with appropriate concern , but without crippling guilt . So standard ' relates to the provision of equipment and activities ; to management of these activities ; and to the relationships with individual children . STYLE The definition in this context is the plan , programme or timemanagement of the play session . There are two main styles , each firmly based on the idea of allowing children the maximum possible time to enjoy experimenting with the fullest possible range of activities . The difference between the two styles hinges on the word possible . // The unstructured session Everything is available throughout the session . Milk or juice and a snack are quietly brought into the room almost as soon as the children are happily settled , and an adult is near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and sit down at once , chatting easily with each other and the available mother . Other children are too absorbed to bother , and it is only as they flag that thoughts turn to elevenses . In this way , no serious play is interrupted , no world of make-believe is rudely shattered , no deep concentration is broken ; for learning-tolearn is largely dependent on lengthening spans of concentration If there is an extra room available , an adult may walk towards it saying , I 'm going to tell a story , would anyone like to come ? ' and those who wish to do so will follow her ( thus the opportunity of free choice is offered to the children , to foster this learning-to-learn ) . Or a mother may sit in the book corner and gather a spontaneous group about her as she tells stories , or sings with them . Music may happen in the same way . Sometimes almost all the children will join in ; sometimes a few will want to watch , or others may prefer to continue with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music or a story that is giving joy to others ; consideration for others will demand that he is offered another choice . Would you like to join us , or would you rather find something quieter to do ? ' Sometimes parents say that they do n't think children should do what they want all the time ' . A well-run unstructured session is far from being undisciplined , for constantly the good of the community has to be safeguarded . Instead of saying , You must come and listen to the story ' , the playgroup leader is saying , I 'm going to tell a story : come and listen if you like , or find something quieter to do ? for you ca n't be noisy for the moment . ' The children are learning the difficult art of selfdiscipline , which combines both obedience and choice ? far , far more difficult than unquestioning obedience . The three-part session Usually the first hour-and-a-half is devoted to the free choice // of a wide range of activities as before . Then the room is cleared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all can have elevenses together ; this is turned into something of a ceremony , with children helping to set the tables , hand round the apples or biscuits and bottles or mugs of milk or juice . The adults usually sit with the children , who are encouraged to hold conversations and to tell their news . When everyone has finished then the room is cleared again for music and movement , or a story , or rhymes and fingerplay . Which is best ? There are so many variable factors that it 's not easy to make a clear-cut choice . Sometimes equipment has to be dismantled and carried outside to be packed into a very small storage shed . It takes time to unbolt a large climbing frame , and unless the biggest things are tackled by 11 a.m. it is impossible to have everything completely cleared and the children ready dressed by 11.45 in order that mothers may collect them and still meet the five-yearold at the school gate at dinner time . Neither is every playgroup leader able to manage the session in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , then the session can degenerate into a free-for-all . This becomes pointless for everybody , and exhausting into the bargain . But a playgroup leader who is not yet able to maintain this degree of unobtrusive control for three unbroken hours may be able to manage the three-part morning most successfully . In this case it is probably better to work within this framework that offers everyone greater security . In some areas children never enjoy a family social meal . Sitting down together with an adult to eat and converse is an experience that some children may never have until they reach school ? and not even then if the staff do not eat with them . Some playgroup leaders who know these families well and note that the children 's concentration span at play tends to be short initially , feel that the age-old ritual of eating together to signify friendship is valuable . Children are hungry for uninterrupted play experiences , hungry for relaxed conversation with adults , hungry for food , hungry for what lies behind the rituals that had their origin in deep human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to balance all the children 's needs , her own // strengths and weaknesses , and the limitations of her environment in such a way that she satisfies as many children as possible , as deeply as possible . VALUE Eventually most of us see enough of the two styles of running a playgroup to become aware that either may be good or poor ? it all depends on the playgroup leader . We are left with the problem of wondering how to raise the standard of the poor groups . But what is a poor group ? Before making a comparative judgment we need to look closely at the environment . We may be saddened to see children painting on small sheets of paper , with what looks like pale dishwater or coloured porridge : a glance out of the window may reveal back-to-back housing , or skyscraper flats , and we may decide that any sort of painting is better than none . Standard is comparative . In some areas inadequate painting would be a retrograde step from the home environment ; in others it offers wonders undreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't as good as it might be , but it is very much better than no playgroup at all . ' After talking with the mothers involved it becomes clear that they are so much happier than they were before it started , and one feels that home must be a very much happier place too . Care is needed at this point , lest the present good is lost in our stampede to make it better . A willingness to change must precede any changes , and this attitude can only come about in a relationship of mutual affection and respect . The mothers , too , will be learning-to-learn , and nothing succeeds like success . One such group was fostered in a mining village by an experienced member of PP A ; no books were available , so she took along some of her own children 's books ; they remained unopened and neglected in a corner for weeks on end ; she dropped in , in a friendly fashion , several times and stayed for coffee and a chat ; one day she took her coffee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; children gathered round ? but a couple of minutes was the limit of their concentration span . Weeks went by , and the pattern was repeated regularly // with growing enjoyment each time . When she had to miss a few weeks , she asked the local Infants Head to drop in , just to keep up the enthusiasm and morale of the mothers . On her first visit the head said Do you read stories to the children ? ' and there was a chorus of yes ' from mothers who had never been known to go near the book corner . But from then on whenever their first visitor popped in there was almost always a different mother looking at books , or telling stories with a group of children . The greater the value of a playgroup in its particular community the more careful we must be in our attempts to raise its standards . When visiting a playgroup the question in one 's mind should not be How does the standard of play here compare with that of a good nursery school ? ' , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these children , as a direct result of the playgroup ? ' If the answer to this second question is that the children are having more stimulation and a greater range of experience than they formerly had , and if the mothers are happier , less anxious and guilt-ridden and more enlightened than they were ? and if the husband is aware of increasing harmony all round ? then it is a good playgroup . And patient , kindly , helpful visiting may make it a very good playgroup indeed . WHO CAN HELP ? From the early days of the Pre-school Playgroups Association the voluntary area organizers have been the backbone of the movement : it is they who are constantly available with practical help and advice ; who will take new enthusiasts to see established groups and put them in touch with playgroup courses ; who will contact isolated groups to say If you want me , I 'm here . ' This invitation is usually accepted with alacrity , and a supportive bond of friendship is formed . The aftermath of a first visit is clearly predictable : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader is to ring up her area organizer . This is often accompanied by a request for another visit . This is difficult to refuse , especially as experience shows so clearly that it is much easier to prevent a playgroup going wrong ' in // these early stages than it is to wait until it is too late and then try to put it right . Once this relationship is established the wear and tear on area organizers and branch committee members is heavy . The telephone rings incessantly , and people in need can be extraordinarily thoughtless . They phone NOW , in the middle of Sunday lunch , at children 's bath-time , during the breakfast rush hour , and even when husbands and wives are asleep . The really wearing phone calls are those prompted by upsets : a parent has turned nasty , a child had an accident ( very rare , this ) and the playgroup leader feels guilty even though it was not her fault ; the village hall committee has put up the rent ; the promised hall has been snatched away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just gone off with the money ( ' No , we were n't insured ' ) ; one partner leaves the group and takes the equipment with her ( ' No , we did n't have a constitution ' ) ; a playgroup wife is nearly demented because her husband has left her ; a mother is distraught because her child has been killed in an accident ; the new playgroup leader is a disaster ( How can we get rid of her ? She 's very well known locally ' ) ; a mother is being awful to her child , and the playgroup leader is sure he 'll be ruined for life if she does nothing ? but what ? The PPA representative listens , and listens , and listens , until she feels wrung out , for she listens with her heart as well as her head . Who else has the degree of caring or the time to listen like this ? Is n't this what society needs ? PPA is answering this need quietly and unobtrusively , and at great personal cost , for few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the wrong thing , and they live through a great deal of real anguish before they discover that the talker hardly ever asks for advice , let alone direction ; the need is for a willing , unjudging , understanding listener and at long last the talker says , I 'm sorry I 've bothered you like this , but I feel ever so much better now that I 've talked to you . ' This chain of help is passed on , for these same playgroup leaders are , in turn , phoned up by the mothers of the playgroup children . The causes of distress are a different set of problems , but equally predictable : the child has enjoyed playgroup right from the very first day but now he has suddenly gone off it ; // Herbert 's turned really nasty to the baby ' ; Ann is so clinging when I 'm on rota duty that I feel awful ' ; Jane shows off so badly when I 'm on rota duty that I feel awful ' ; Peter ca n't understand why I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nearly due , and he feels awful ' ; Now that I 'm at home alone with the new baby , and I do n't see you all , I feel awful . ' The real cause of distress is the child 's difficulty in learning to share his mother . The playgroup does not cause these problems but allows the manifestations to appear , and once the signs are there the mothers who have been through that stage can rally round with reassurance . The stream of anxieties continues : My husband gets so impatient when Dean wants the landing light on , but he gets so frightened with it off ' ; The big ones are so bossy with Lynne , and it seems to be rows all the time ' ; Our Pat 's black and blue where William pinches her in the playgroup , and my husband says he is n't going to stand for it ' ; Alec had a new white jersey on this morning , and it 's ruined with red paint on the sleeves ' ; Jenny 's not to do music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; Amanda used to paint ever so nicely at home , and now she only paints these messes ' . They are all such little problems set down on paper , but they loom so large when you are at home alone all day ? babies and monotonous jobs such as washing-up , bed-making , preparing food and cleaning leave the mind wide open for turmoil to develop over any one of these matters . In other areas it is the shoe leather that is worn , for mothers here do not remember where the nearest telephone box is situated , and they are afraid to use it if they do . The popping-in technique has to replace the phone , and the problems are different again . You know you said to get a supervisor ? Well , we 've got her , she was a supervisor in the factory over the way ' ; Mrs X keeps sending Martin with chocolate wafers for lunch and the other kids whine because they have n't got any ' ; We 've saved up ? 30 for a trip to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waste and we ought to buy something for the playgroup , and we do n't see why we should ' ; We 'll never be able to buy a climbing frame , the Christmas party alone took ? 17 ' ; ' Tracey 's mother throws her weight about just because she 's had seven kids of her own , and they 're nothing to write home about anyway ' ; Bill 's mother shouts at the kids so , and smacks them // too ; We all smack our own at home , but you should n't do it here should you ? ? it frightens the others ' ; What can we do about mothers who smoke all the time ? It does n't seem right to lean over the children and spill ash all over them . ' Area organisers learn to answer their questioners , not merely the questions . The sensible ' comment on ? 30 for an outing might be Do n't . The children need a climbing frame . ' The sensitive comment is likely to be different . Parents want , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-spots of their own childhood , and Sunday-school outings to the sea-side rank high in our cultural heritage ? to break the continuity of family experience can be as damaging in some respects as it is desirable in others . The cycle of enrichment is as valid as the cycle of deprivation . Wise befrienders know that memories and experiences shared and discussed can lead to new learning , growth and development ? next year the group may still want to repeat a richly satisfying experience ? but when the climbing frame eventually arrives it will be as the result of a new stage in the growth of the parents ' observations and understanding , and the children will benefit even more from this than from the climbing frame . Area organisers are the top-line volunteers of the playgroup movement : their knowledge and experience is shaping the nature and extent of the training for which they ask . Since 1970 PPA has been holding Training Days nationally , regionally and locally ? in some areas on-going groups are established and help many area organisers to extend their role to tutoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those not involved in playgroups but who are anxious to know how they can combine children and chores at home to the benefit of all concerned . Many area organisers are now forming teams of playgroup visitors , both to spread the workload , and to encourage experienced playgroup people to accept a new stage of responsibility , growth and learning . What is the future for these able and experienced volunteers ? The area organisers will continue to be needed , not only for the work they do but as the link between the playgroups and the many professionals now sharing responsibility for the underfives and their families . // PPA can produce and train its volunteers , but they can not continue work on the scale needed unless local authorities can pay realistic expenses , especially in rural areas . 73 Chapter 5 What 's in a name ? Nursery schools , day nurseries , nursery classes , playgroups , playschools , nursery groups , toddlers ' groups , child minders , creches : how are parents to know which to choose ? Legal definitions and common usage have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following attempt to clarify them can only be a guide , since there is considerable overlap and variation , especially in the voluntary and private enterprises . NURSERY SCHOOLS It would help to remove much damaging misunderstanding if this term were used only for those establishments run by education authorities . It could then rightly be assumed that they were free ; that they were run by a teacher who had had three years ' nursery school training ( or , in Scotland , by a fullytrained teacher who had undertaken an additional year 's training for nursery school teaching ) ; that two-year trained nursery nurses ( NNEB ) were her assistants ; that the premises and garden ( which is obligatory ) conformed to the standards required by the Education Act ; that they operated for the same hours as the local schools ; and that the age range was two to five years . These state nursery schools are free to all children , and it is left to the head teacher to decide how she fills the places from her vast waiting list . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others there are only one or two , so it is not surprising to learn that waiting lists can have over 1000 names on them . In some cases waiting lists are closed at a realistic level ; heads anxious to have a full picture of local demand may keep the list open for their own interest , but they are // careful not to raise the hopes of mothers who can have no hope of placing a child before school . During the last three years , when speaking with heads of nursery schools , it is noticeable that they tend to tackle their waiting lists in one of two ways . They may give priority to children referred as being in actual need , or at risk . This can mean that there is not a single ordinary ' applicant among the children . This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs since nursery schools aim to have a well-balanced cross-section of the community , where the less privileged child is helped by the more privileged child , and vice versa . In every case the head teacher has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with her to achieve the apparently impossible goal of readiness to go on to big school ' . As they usually express it , If they start infant school with a backlog of five years of poor experience , and even poorer handling , what chance have they got ? ' They may carefully keep a balance between privileged , underprivileged , handicapped , maladjusted and so-called average children . This is not easy , and head teachers have harrowing tales to tell of deputations of mothers coming to say , It is n't fair to have children who live in nice houses with gardens , when you wo n't take some of the kids down our way who need it more . ' In one case I was told of some mothers who withdrew their children , because they felt so guilty at taking the places of more needy children . In order to give a chance to as many children as possible , many nursery schools make provision for children to attend either full time , or for part of a day . State provision needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of normality that is their greatest strength . And is not every child worthy of being helped towards the fullest possible version of himself ? ' NURSERY CLASSES These are attached to infant schools , under the infant head teacher . The running of the class is , ideally , undertaken by a 78 WHAT 'S IN A NAME ? nursery school teacher , but this is not always possible in such a time of shortage . From the children 's point of view the difference between the two state systems is that in a nursery class they are living on the fringe of someone else 's world ; in a nursery school they are becoming masters of their own . DAY NURSERIES These come under the Social Services Department . They are open during working hours , and priority is given to the children of mothers who are the sole breadwinners , or to those whose social need is grave . While nursery schools are free , a charge is made for a place at a day nursery : it varies over the country , and each area has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the applicants . The children range in age from a few weeks to five years . The matron in charge should be a trained nurse , or nursery nurse , with previous experience of normal children and a prior appointment as a deputy matron . The programme of play , and the care of the play equipment for all the age groups , should be the responsibility of an experienced nursery nurse , who has received additional training for the post . The assistants in closest contact with the children are nursery nurses , or three students still in training may be counted as one trained nurse if the day nursery is used as a training centre . Extra assistants must be over eighteen years of age , and should have had in-service training after a short introductory spell in the day nursery . There are private day nurseries , which have to meet the same requirements with regard to premises and staff , but their charges vary more widely . In one town , two private day nurseries in the same road charged ? 3.50 and ? 7 respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not inclusive of breakfast . The play facilities vary considerably . CHILD MINDERS Officially , anyone taking into her home one child or more ( who is not related to her ) for two or more hours a day , for reward , // is a child minder . All such persons are required to be registered by the Social Services Department . House playgroups are child minders by this definition , and they are of varying quality . MOTHER AND TODDLER CLUBS There are many variations on this theme , but one particular pattern is beginning to spread slowly over the country , and it is of such value that I propose to describe this version only under the above title . At their best , these clubs are intended for mothers ? often in deprived areas ? accompanied by their toddlers ( loosely , children between the ages of about eighteen months and three ) . They may be initiated by a health visitor , social worker , playgroup leader or other mature person who understands that the great need at this stage is for mothers to come together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reassured . Few mothers are prepared for the developments of this second year of life . Often they have stopped attending the clinic , so no one is able to say , Look , you 've got a beautiful baby ? happy , healthy , secure , intelligent . And precisely because he is all these things he will soon begin to find his own personality , and to test both you and himself as far as he can go . Do not worry or get upset , you have not " done anything " or " gone wrong " . But it can be a bit wearing , and a bit tricky domestically sometimes . Why not join our Toddlers ' Club ? ' Often a playgroup will offer its equipment , and even playgroup leader , for an afternoon so that the mothers can relax together at one end of the hall , while the children investigate the toys and each other in the same room . There is great relief in comparing notes with other mothers at this stage ; and even greater benefit if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the mothers are able to discover some of the answers to their own problems . The mothers can relax , seeing that the children are safe and happily absorbed ; if a child is tearful or fearful his mother is at hand , and often he is perfectly contented to sit peacefully on her lap and watch the other children . Most mothers agree that one of the major causes of their exhaustion at this stage is the fact that they must watch and listen without a break for 80 WHAT 'S IN A NAME ? every waking minute of every day ( and quite often during the night as well ) . A certain temperament of toddler at a certain stage literally makes it impossible for a mother to be alone even in the lavatory . This is the stage when some children can move and climb with great speed ; and do not yet know the meaning of such words as sharp , hot , heavy , hard , fall , crush , dangerous . Naturally enough , the longing of many of these mothers is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can be left for a short while every day ? hence the constant appeal to playgroups to admit two-year-olds . It is not lack of sympathy that prompts the Pre-school Playgroups Association to reiterate constantly that playgroups are intended primarily for the threeand four-year-olds . It is an awareness of two needs . It is impossible to ignore all the weight of research pointing to the fact that the separation of mother and child should be gradual and confident ; and that most children need to be with their mothers until they are three . The pattern of the Mother and Toddler Clubs allows the best of both worlds ; the mother feels relaxed and is resting physically whilst being happily stimulated and reassured ; the child is learning to explore a large room , new toys and activities , and other children on his own ? yet within sight of the mother on whom he is still so naturally dependent . Whether or not they acknowledge the fact consciously , the real fear of many mothers at this stage is that they are failures since their children are sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dump-and-run ; they long to put the child somewhere where they ' will get him right again ' . The urgent need at this crisis point is for the mother to be understood , accepted , and helped to understand and manage her own child . CRECHES This used to be the old name for what are now known as day nurseries , but today the term is widely and loosely used . In many cases so-called toddlers ' clubs now come within this category . If the cache runs for less than two consecutive hours , and if // no charge is made , then the venture does not have to be registered neither are the premises inspected . Some creches give no cause for concern , even if they are not always as valuable as they might be for the children . The term can cover a multitude of circumstances , however , and it conjures up an impression of children left with a band of volunteers to play together , while the mothers do the weekly shopping , attend church , or just have a morning free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In theory , the idea is a good one . Few children enjoy being trailed round large stores ; prams may have to be left outside , and often the baby is too heavy to be carried up to and around the various departments ; but in practice , it may be less than ideal as children are left with complete strangers , often with no period of settling-in by the harassed mother concerned . Also the age range may vary from babies in prams to rising fives , and the noise and confusion may be considerable . On the other hand they can be excellent . One such has been running for many years in a Salvation Army hall , adjacent to a market and shopping centre . It is open every day , with the same friendly , capable woman and her assistants , and the same wide range of activities awaiting the children . Many of the children attend regularly , and the settled atmosphere is such that the majority of new visitors are prepared to be left when the mothers say , Would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness of creches tends to be that the willing volunteers are unable to provide sufficient equipment and activities to hold the children 's interest ; the age range is such that the little ones interfere with the play of the bigger ones , and are at risk physically during the process . Another is that there is often a lack of continuity in the voluntary helpers so that the children are unable to build a relationship with one well-known person ; this is particularly distressing for some children . PLAYGROUPS , PLAYSCHOOLS , NURSERY GROUPS These are all personally chosen names , and convey nothing specific at all ; it is quite impossible to choose between the groups merely on the basis of their names . All that can be taken 82 WHAT 'S IN A NAME ? for granted is that the premises and playgroup leaders have been passed by the Social Services Department ; that the ratio of adults to children has been fixed officially and , in some areas , that the groups have not been allowed to start unless the playgroup leader is suitably qualified ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) In theory , all those who start playgroups aim to give the children the richest play experience possible . The tremendous range of types and standards is due largely to the range of personalities of the playgroup leaders , and of their understanding of children , childhood , and the needs and strengths of parents . For those new to the subject it may be helpful to oversimplify the situation , and to say that playgroups may be good ' , or rigid ' , or uncontrolled ' , and to clarify each category . The good playgroup A good playgroup provides a first-class environment where , in a happy , busy atmosphere , children are painting ; experimenting with wet and dry sand , water , clay , dough , bricks , woodwork , climbing apparatus and a wide variety of table toys ; playing imaginatively in the home corner , or on improvised ships and buses ; listening to stories ; looking at books ; enjoying music ; singing ; or chatting with interested adults about anything and everything . There will be ample opportunity for the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stimulated to curiosity , wonder , reflection , discovery and the excitement of discovering , thinking and planning . There will be the security that comes from community rules , kept out of consideration for others , and in this security the children will know **26;0;TOOLONG Parents will know themselves to be wanted , needed and appreciated . They will rejoice in discovering and offering their talents , and in shouldering responsibility . There will be opportunities to be with , and learn from , the children and each other . The uncontrolled playgroup Usually those running such groups have enough learning to be familiar with the term free play ' , but not enough experience or understanding to know that children can only be free when certain community rules are obeyed . These groups run ( and // that is the operative word ) on a free-for-all system , and so much of the playgroup leaders ' physical and nervous energy is spent in keeping a slightly fearful eye on the most aggressive or exuberant children that they completely fail to see that the timid ones are never free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest they should be knocked over or shouted at ; and the noise level exhausts them . The rigid playgroup These are more difficult to explain and understand , for the children often appear to be happy . The majority of parents have no hesitation at home in deciding when a child is **26;28;TOOLONG or **27;56;TOOLONG . However happy ' William may be as he picks the heads off the tulips , he is diverted smartly to a more appropriate activity . But play and child development are so little understood by many parents that they have no such clear idea of what constitutes being happy doing the right ' thing , or happy doing the wrong ' thing in a playgroup . In a rigid playgroup the children 's activities are often controlled in groups , and even timed by the clock . For example , when they arrive they may each be given a small board and a ball of plasticine for the first twenty minutes . This may then be put away , to be replaced by shapes drawn on small pieces of paper and tins of wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without going over the lines . This may be followed by a period of looking at books ( given out , not chosen ) , and playing with table toys ( also given out , not chosen ) . Milk time may even be silent , with every child required to sit still until the slowest child has finished . The story or music time that follows may well be obligatory , and no allowance is made for those who are not able yet to concentrate for the span of a story , or those who would like to watch and listen to the music but feel unready to take an active part . Many playgroup leaders from such groups attend playgroup courses , and listen with interest to modern methods , but are unwilling or unable to change their ways . Sometimes it is because of their insecurity , and many will say , ' I would n't like to change , the children never get out-of-hand this way ' ; or But our way is so much easier ! ' or I never could stand noise 84 WHAT 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me best . ' But not all are like this . Fortunately , in many cases the women running some of these old-fashioned groups radiate a brand of child-magic that speaks for itself ; if their methods are old-fashioned so is their sound common sense , their particular brand of love , and their fund of real wisdom . One such claims an infallible cure for small boys frightened of the barbers ; I just sit down on one of their little chairs , let him wrap a sheet round me , and cut my hair ? it never fails . ' Children in the care of such people gain a sense of security that is invaluable , but the needs of children are infinitely variable from child to child and day to day , and the more flexible the regime the more their needs will be met . It is regrettable that these rigid playgroups so often call themselves nursery schools . 85 Chapter 6 How are playgroups started ? HOME GROUPS These are by no means the second-best form of playgroups ; they exist in their own right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The variation is wide , but all the following may be considered to be typical : Farm houses , where from four to fourteen or so children may gather together several times a week . Pet lambs , goats , calves , donkeys or ponies may be part of the playgroup scene . There are expeditions to gather eggs , blackberries , apples or frogspawn ; and adults who share the new experiences and talk about them . The joys of the country can be seen , heard , felt , smelt , tasted and stored up within . Small terrace houses , holding perhaps up to six children , spread happily throughout the hall , kitchen and living room . They may paint in the kitchen , play with water at the sink , use the space under the stairs as a home ' , have bricks in the hall and table toys in the living room . One such playgroup stands out in my memory ; no pains had been spared to turn it into a haven for children whose need was great ; even the piano had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a special visit to say , Thank you , missus , you 've done our Debbie a bloody bomb ! ' Houses so spacious that it is possible to give the playgroup two or three rooms , where everything can remain in position for the next session . These groups may cater for as many as twenty children at a time . The particular strength of housegroups lies in the feeling of home from home that some children need before they are ready to enter a bigger community . The smaller groups often have a 86 HOW ARE PLAYGROUPS STARTED ? specific value , such as helping a child from another country to gain a second language , for there are fewer children 's names to remember , closer friendships with fewer people , more familiar objects to identify and name , and a feeling of greater intimacy to set the scene for the sharing of new words . Frequently husbands have made cupboards , shelves , outdoor equipment . One converted a garage with sand troughs attached to the back walls , easels and a large Wendy House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to cover the concrete floor . Each night the carpet was covered with sheeting before the car was carefully inched-in . Is it surprising that such husbands and wives think in terms of our playgroup ' ? Committees would be out of place as they work out for themselves what they would like to do next for the children in their home and garden . It is not at all unusual for such groups merely to break even , or even to run at a slight loss . Several husbands explained it by saying , My wife does n't smoke , and hardly ever drinks , and she gets a terrific kick out of doing this , so I 'm prepared to call her loss her cigarette money . ' The community must be very careful not to judge and condemn all private groups as profit-making groups . Many are truly charitable in a moral sense , but can not be registered as charities without a committee and constitution . At the moment such house groups are not eligible for grants ( in the few cases where grants are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would help if such cases could be judged on their merits , for many are serving needy children who can afford to pay so little that endless fund-raising activities are necessary in order that adequate equipment may be bought and made . One mother announced with regret that the playgroup would have to be stopped for a term as she was due to have a major operation . The other mothers said , Why ca n't we carry on for you ? We 've hung around here in your hall chatting , and we know exactly what to do , and where things go , and we could keep the house ticking over for you too . ' So they did , for the whole term , with washing-up , bed-making , and a spot of cooking thrown in . The above types of group need cause no concern , but others give just cause for disquiet . Some people are undoubtedly // jumping on the band-wagon , spurred on occasionally by an article in a glossy magazine suggesting that playgroups can be run for pin money ' . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge too much , and to provide too little equipment . Such playgroups can be a very limiting experience , where children may be given nothing more inspiring to do than thumb through piles of indifferent books , and play with cardboard cartons filled with a miscellaneous selection of other people 's cast-off toys . HALL GROUPS Private enterprises Some people need to earn a salary according to their professional scale . One nursery school trained teacher said , This is my profession . I have got to help my husband with our mortgage . I ca n't work in a nursery school because there is n't one , and teaching the over-fives just is n't my cup of tea . Yet I 'm made to feel guilty at earning money doing a worthwhile job well ! Would people really rather that I went to work in a shop , which is the only other job I 'd be likely to get ? ' Others , sometimes with fewer qualifications , may need to earn a modest but adequate salary and if they offer the children a really worthwhile experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , then this is a personal decision that no one has the right to question . The groups that should concern everyone are those where the motive to make money is very much stronger than the desire to help the children , or where the desire to help the children is real enough , but the knowledge of how to do so is lacking . In one such group the mothers paid 25p a morning , and the children ran round pushing chairs , climbed on the table and jumped off , or looked at piles of tatty comics . Such people usually start with the best possible motives , but know so little about children , childhood and play that the group is almost bound to be very poor indeed . If they have no committee , and no mothers are involved , only the playgroup leader and her assistant may know what goes on . It may be a very long while before parents discover that all is not well with the playgroup , 88 HOW ARE PLAYGROUPS STARTED ? for they tend to assume that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with him . One such child was entered for a playgroup , and on being asked in a friendly fashion if he liked playing with other children , a heavy silence engulfed the three . Then the mother said diffidently , I suppose I ought to tell you , he was expelled from his first playgroup . Will it make any difference ? ' The playgroup leader assured her that it would not , and the mother went on , He was only three at the time , but he was expelled at the end of the first week because he would n't concentrate , or co-operate ? they said that he would n't even try to write his name . ' No playgroup , run by either trained or untrained playgroup leaders , should attempt any such kind of formal work . Parent involvement as rota helpers tends to be less in profitmaking groups , partly because those who start them usually say that they can manage without parents ( and they have not understood that many parents need to be involved ) but more often because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think that if parents are paying for the best they have the right to expect a constant and able staff ; certainly they should n't be expected both to pay and work . ' Yet many of these playgroup leaders go to great lengths to establish a warm personal relationship with their mothers . Many arrange social events , talks , holiday outings , and even organize coach or van parties to attend playgroup courses if word gets around that they are ever so helpful for just mothers as well as playgroup leaders ' . Community playgroups There are several variations on this theme . 1 . The most usual way of starting is for a group of friends and neighbours to decide that they need a playgroup . In more privileged areas this need is felt spontaneously , and the idea spreads rapidly by word of mouth , telephone , or an advertisement in the local paper . A meeting follows , permission is sought from the social services , there is usually a request to the Pre-school Playgroups Association for guidance , the relevant publications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn up to give charitable status . // In less privileged areas the need is usually sensed by a few only , and it may take very much longer to cover the same ground ; but if these few take all the initiative and keep it , the parents whose need is greatest are not nursed over their apathy-barrier , and the project does not engender the fire of enthusiasm necessary to launch the playgroup safely . 2 . A playgroup may be started off by an existing group of women , such as the Young Wives , the Mothers ' Union , the Women 's Institute , or the Townswomen 's Guild . A Committee is formed ; a charitable status constitution is drawn up and the whole group sets to work to raise money and collect equipment . The mothers of the playgroup children may form the committee , provide the playgroup leader , and supply the helper-mothers . Everything is decided democratically , and any money over after paying the rent and the playgroup leader is ploughed back into the playgroup in the form of equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decide that they do not wish to be involved in the actual running of it . They provide the committee , which appoints the playgroup leader , raises the funds , and allocates the spending money . But the playgroup leader runs the playgroup . Sometimes a committee member is present each day , ostensibly to collect the money , but really to be available to chat with anyone who needs it ? this leaves the playgroup leader free to devote herself to the children . Occasionally , there is too little liaison between the committee and the playgroup leader , who may find that unsuitable equipment has been ' provided without reference to the present needs of the children . But usually she is well content to devote herself to the children and mothers in the knowledge that all the administrative jobs are being undertaken by others . 4 . The every-mother-a-leader ' group . These flourish well in areas where money is so tight that there is no hope of any mother being able to pay more than 5p or 8p for a morning 's play . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with which to pay a playgroup leader even a token salary . Mothers in this situation need someone to start them off , and to remain on call afterwards . It may be a vicar , or minister , a // children 's officer , a social worker , or a mature member of a voluntary association such as an area organizer of PPA . The mothers then take it in turn to provide daily groups of playgroup leaders . Variations on this theme were dealt with in Chapter 1 . It is advisable for playgroups to register as a charity when their constitution is in order ; ' it is regretted that so many groups do not understand the practicalities of charitable status and deliberately refrain from seeking it , in the mistaken belief that the playgroup leader will not be allowed to receive payment , neither will the playgroup be able to put away a small sum for emergencies . Charitable status indicates to the community that the playgroup committee has a responsible attitude to finance , but is not run for financial gain . Playgroups not registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit , may find that they are not eligible for grants from various sources . 5 . The playgroup coaxed into existence unobtrusively by an authority employee , or a voluntary worker . The method may vary from knocking on doors to putting up notices in clinics and shops or slipping invitations to a meeting through 2,000 letter-boxes ( a 1 per cent response is usual , but it is enough ) . The catalyst continues to lead from the rear and to offer ' training ' disguised as meetings ' . Six to nine valuable learningpacked months may well precede the opening of the playgroup , and those impatient for the children 's sake must understand that during this period the children are benefiting at home through their mothers ' increased happiness and learning . 6 . Mother and Toddler Clubs often produce a few mothers who decide that they want to start a playgroup for the three-year-olds who have outgrown the **33;85;TOOLONG stage , and who need a fuller range of equipment . These mothers are used to being in a group and often have the confidence and incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet ready for this , they are ready and willing to attend workshop sessions and discussions with a playgroup adviser , tutor or area organiser in their familiar hall . // an old and rather dingy hall may be even more rewarding . Such halls have inspired group decorating sessions , and even plumbing and wiring has been undertaken by willing fathers . One small hall could not be put into use until the fathers had dug over 100 yards of trench in order to lay on water , while the mothers decorated and made curtains ? no wonder this group radiated such joy and purpose . Better an old hall used freely and creatively than a beautiful new one that inhibits the children . But would it not be possible to plan new premises with playgroups in mind ? Could there not be a purpose-built store room , with a window , washable floor , sink and tap ? When all the equipment had been put in the hall , this small room would be available for sand and water play . OUTDOOR PLAYSPACE This is highly desirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having contact with living and growing things . They need to be out of doors , to be introduced to the wind , clouds , frost , ice , snow , mud and dust ; they need to dig , examine worms and insects ; plant seeds ; pick growing flowers ( one nasturtium seed in a large pot will provide a long succession of flowers ) . Sometimes outdoor space needs to be cleared , or fenced . Often local planning permission is given for the erection of a specified type of wall or fence , providing the playgroup pays for it ? the cost has been known to be as high as ? 400 . Sometimes the labour involved in removing dilapidated outhouses , and the accumulated rubbish of years , is too great for people already stretched to their limit . PLAYGROUP LEADERS It does not always follow that , because a playgroup leader is an NNEB , SRN , Infant or Junior teacher , or the holder of a degree , she is automatically better at working with three- and four-yearolds and their mothers than someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or others , who had no training for anything after leaving school , or who had an apparently irrelevant training . However , it is already clear that whether or // not playgroup leaders were previously qualified , they would be helped by a specially designed Playgroup Course . Perhaps this was one of the most difficult lessons I had to learn ; it is enlightening to see someone untrained running a first-class playgroup . Possibly we forget how much learning and growing can go on throughout our lives . What one is matters in this field of human relationships even more that what one knows . For this reason it is worth repeating clearly : 1 . Relevant trainings ' are no guarantee for making good playgroup leaders . 2 . Untrained mothers , and others , can do excellent work . The value of specially planned playgroup courses is already clear . Even good teachers have acknowledged the help that they needed before undertaking the extra dimension of motherinvolvement in playgroup work . RECOMMENDATIONS TO THOSE ABOUT TO BE REGISTERED 1 . Please avoid the term Nursery School or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . 2 . Make contact with the local voluntary area organizer or the local branch of PPA ? they will see to it that you have all the help and advice that they can give you from their own experience . 3 . Be sure that you , and your playgroup , are adequately insured . PPA offers a special Playgroup Insurance Policy , but the suggestion still needs to be made at the time of registering in case a group fails to make contact with PPA. 4 . Visit as many nursery schools and playgroups as you can before starting your own . 5 . Attend a playgroup course if there is one available . RECOMMENDATIONS TO SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS 1 . That registration shall fall into two parts : ( a ) The registration of premises . // ( b ) The permission to start the playgroup , which should be withheld until the people concerned and the equipment provided reach reasonable levels of readiness . 2 . That no playgroup shall be registered for more than twentyfour children , however big the hall may be . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the difference to the finances . ) The reasons for this recommendation are : ( a ) Twenty children , one or two mothers , and a helper constitute the maximum number to whom even a good playgroup leader can give her full attention . ( b ) The overall weakness of playgroups is that the level of noise is too high . The presence of nineteen other children is more than enough for the twentieth . 3 . That hall rents are negotiated , when necessary , on behalf of those who want to start a playgroup . In so many cases , those who most need a low rent are unable to meet the committee concerned to put their case adequately , still less are they able to exert any pressure . 4 . That persuasion should be brought to bear on hall committees refusing to allow storage cupboards to be installed because it would spoil the appearance of the premises . Too many playgroup people accept this and continue to work under quite unreasonable conditions . 96 Chapter 8 Various aspects of cost RENTS FOR HALLS These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls rent free , but the playgroups give a donation to cover the cost of heating and caretaking . Some halls charge ? 5 for a three-hour session . Some halls charge ? 1 per hour ; sometimes a system of heating has been installed that was appropriate for its intended use , but the playgroup finds that it costs ? 1 an hour for heat alone . Some halls charge a high rent , and then use the residual heat in the room for their own afternoon functions . Some halls charge a nominal rent , say 40p , and the vicar goes in daily at 6.30 a.m. to light the aged stove in order that the room shall be warm by 9 a.m . Others charge a low rent in return for the mothers becoming regular caretakers . Some Education Committees allow disused schools , youth club premises or adult education centres to be used rent free , the cost of heating to be met by the playgroup . Playgroups are run in village halls , church halls , Women 's Institute halls , community centres , scout huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each hall committee fixes its own rent , usually in accordance with what it imagines to be the financial state of the playgroup . Two factors are often overlooked : if the children are to play as frequently as they need , the cost must be kept low . Rents need to be about 50p a session , even 70p may be too high in some areas ; and playgroups have hidden costs . The playgroup is sometimes to blame when rents are unrealistic for they have failed to explain their expenses over and above the rent and the payment for the leader . On the other hand , some committees see the regular letting of their hall to the playgroup as a means of making money ; this Is particularly difficult to justify in those cases where the hall // is already heated during the morning , whether or not it is in use . Is it not better to receive a small rent than none at all ? Do committee members realize just how much effort lies behind the payment of this rent ? Much more careful communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel used ' by the other . DEPRECIATION FOR HOUSE PLAYGROUPS Mention of this should be made . People tend to assume that because a playgroup pays no rent in a house , then a large profit is being made . Many wives do pay their husbands " rent ' , and careful bookkeeping is available for income tax purposes . Even when a formal payment is not made , the fact remains that extra rooms are heated , timber is bought for the construction of shelves and cupboards , walls are more frequently redecorated and carpets receive extra wear . In many cases large sums of money have already been spent on installing extra toilets and washbasins , rendering doors and ceilings fireproof , and frequently building an extension especially for the playgroup . PLAYGROUP LEADERS ' PAYMENTS Many playgroup leaders work for no payment for a year or more , until the playgroup is safely established and the children have adequate equipment . The average payment seems to be between ? 1 and ? 1.50 for a three-hour session for the playgroup leader , and 75p and ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for love and this token payment is seen as such . Some churches will only allow a playgroup to use their hall if all the help is voluntary . This can have unfortunate repercussions , for there tends to be a succession of playgroup leaders , and the children never know whom to expect . It should be remembered that giving up three or four mornings a week can be expensive on the housekeeping , for mid-day dinners have to be prepared quickly , once the playgroup is over , with expensive frozen foods which are quicker than hand-prepared vegetables ? costs soon mount . // But another important issue arises : should the mothers of the children want to take advantage of permanent voluntary labour , especially if this help is given several times a week ? It should be remembered that a three-hour play session usually means four hours work , for it takes half an hour to set up and clear away the activities ( more if the storage is particularly inadequate ) . One of the chief joys of playgroup leaders who earn a little money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas presents with money that has not been saved from the housekeeping ? this has been the most frequent comment of all when they have spoken of their earnings . The difference between a salary and a token payment is important . An adequate salary might tempt some people to stay on indefinitely , growing stale or else dominating the mothers by their competence . Worse still , some people might apply for such posts because it seemed a congenial and convenient way of earning good money , and some groups of mothers lack the confidence to sack a wrong choice . Many playgroup leaders work for a token payment for several years , and then the need for more money ( or a professional training ) leads them to move on , leaving the way clear for someone else to grow in stature and take her place . Such leaders , knowing that they are not intending to stay indefinitely , take pride and joy in delegating responsibility to parents ? whose response and growth delights them as much as the children . HIDDEN COSTS I. Insurance and/or Industrial Injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adequate insurance can not be over-emphasized . Some groups are not insured for anything , not even for third party claims related to the children in their care . ( Should it not be a legal obligation ? Recent court awards suggest that a minimum cover of ? 100,000 would be well advised . ) Every // employee should be covered for employers ' liability , and technically a certificate to this effect should be exhibited at the place of employment . 3 . The morning snack . Fruit juice , biscuits , apples , carrots , etc. are provided at no extra cost to the children . Free milk can be obtained , but since the ministry repays three months in arrears some groups feel unable to cope with the records and the money . 4 . Toilet requisites ; paper towels and tissues . Some groups have no facilities for hanging towels on pegs , and if children bring their own towels each day there is the complication of seeing that each one is put into its owner 's carrier bag or satchel . Toilet rolls . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their own toilet rolls on the premises then these have gone the following day . So not only do they have to be provided , but locked up with the equipment at the end of each session . Soap . Most groups seem to provide their own , also their washing-up liquid . 5 . Expendable equipment . Flour and salt ( for dough ) ; powder paint ; glue of various types for various purposes ; paper ; sellotape ; first aid items ( often including the regular purchase of disinfectant for the toilets ) ; and stationery for notes , invitations , notices of jumble sales , etc . COST TO PARENTS This is based on the out-going expenses referred to above . Because it is the rent which varies more than any other factor , the charges to the children vary quite widely . The extremes would seem to be 2-p and 43p ; the more usual charges vary between 15p and 25p . The attendance of children at playgroups is not always dependent upon the family income : spending priorities are highly personal , and relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern of payment . 1 . A council estate in a particular area may house a majority // of families who are deprived in many respects , including financially . It may be essential to keep the cost down to 5p or 8p , and some committees allow their hearts to overrule their heads to the extent of not making a charge if the children are absent . This may mean that the first wet or foggy day reduces the number of children from twenty to five . Or an epidemic of measles can have the same effect , but for a longer period . In these circumstances , not only does the playgroup leader find herself without payment , but the rent has to be covered from the Committee 's private purses . Mothers in these areas would find it hard , both financially and emotionally , to pay for what they have n't had ' , so payment in arrears is out . And so , almost always , is monthly payment in advance . The happiest solution seems to be for mothers to pay two weeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week thereafter . In this way there is always a week 's money in hand to offset against illness ; and mothers are less likely to keep children away for casual days if they know they have already paid for them . 2 . In some apparently poor areas , mothers have been known to offer double pay if you 'll let me off rota duty ' , some add that they pay 20p an hour for baby-sitters when they go out with their husbands , so 40p a morning 's still dirt cheap ' . 3 . In some areas the mothers find life so difficult that they are only able to get through each day if they are buoyed up by the thought of a personal pleasure in the evening . One such mother stopped her daughter 's attendance at the playgroup ( two mornings at 13p each ) because she could n't afford it ' , and to substantiate her claim she volunteered a budget statement ending with ? 1.75 for Bingo . The playgroup leader suggested a compromise whereby the mother had ? 1.50 for Bingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply was , Christ ! You must have something for yourself ! ' This cry must be taken seriously ; until the children are easier to manage , and the mother makes friendships that are rewarding , she will continue to need this nightly escape . 4 . In some areas mothers have said , Let 's all pay an extra 2-p a day so there 's a fund to cover needy children . ' // 5 . In some areas mothers who can not pay in cash pay in kind ? they ask to clean the room each day , or look after the dressingup clothes and wash them each week . 6 . In some areas where mothers say they can not afford 20p a session , the children play at home alone in expensive pedal cars , or with fabulous dolls ' prams . It takes time for such attitudes to change , and it can only come about by word of mouth , as playgroup mothers enthuse about this new experience in their lives . 7 . In at least one area , prone to strikes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby each mother brought her weekly money in a specially provided two inch square envelope . It was an unwritten law that everyone handed in her envelope each week , even if it was empty . This saved face and they were all left free to make up the money later if they could , or to forget it with a clear conscience if they could not . Up to the time of speaking to me about it , the playgroup leader said that no one had ever taken advantage of this situation , and those who had been unable to make up all the money had helped in countless practical ways ; or even raised the money by making a cake and raffling it among the other mothers . 8 . Sometimes parents pay by cheque , a term in advance ; sometimes they pay in cash , a term in advance for two of their children . 9 . Some playgroups ask for ? 1 deposit when the child first joins , to be refunded when he leaves . In the early days of a playgroup this helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is interesting to note that in some very deprived areas this is accepted without question , and not once has this been reclaimed if the child failed to accept the vacancy when it was offered . 10 . In some areas the income from the children never covers the outgoing expenses , and fund-raising is a permanent part of the playgroup scene . Jumble sales are probably the greatest stand-by , but often the jumble has to be provided from other sources since those who thankfully wear jumble are not in a // position to provide it . In these areas bring-and-buy stalls and small raffles are welcomed , as long as tickets are cheap ? four 2p tickets offer a better chance than two 4p tickets ; and if there is only 2p to spare , then it 's still a chance worth taking and no harm done . 103 Chapter 9 The Pre-school Playgroups Association HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Parents had a difficult time during the war years ? the choice to evacuate the children or not was a new dilemma in our society . The children who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of being uprooted yet again to go back to a mother who was sometimes less real to them than their foster parents . Fathers came back to be greeted by strangers ; and when the children had been born while the fathers were abroad there was often an emotional blank that was never adequately filled . It was the children who were three and four years old at the outbreak of war who had to grow through this turbulent period before becoming parents of three- and fouryear-olds in 1960 . At this time Belle Tutaev brought into being her first playgroup , started for the sake of her own child , and she wrote a letter to the Guardian , saying that she would gladly offer help and advice to anyone wanting to do the same thing . There was a flood of replies from all over the country . From this one letter the playgroup movement snowballed ; from one child in 1961 to approximately 250,000 in 1974 . The time was right , not only for the limelight to focus on the underfives , but also on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents began to realize just how much they were benefiting themselves , and the principle of parent involvement was born . Even though membership more or less doubled each year for the next three or four years , the numbers remained small enough for the family feeling to predominate . And as new // playgroups were encouraged by personal contact , the idea of parent involvement was perpetuated by example and personal explanation . Then the idea began to spread . Motives for starting playgroups were by no means always altruistic , and parent involvement did not appeal to many of the newcomers , but the concept of parent involvement as an integral part of the playgroup was staunchly adhered to by the pioneers who started playgroups . VOLUNTARY ORGANIZERS Area As founder members took it upon themselves to offer help to new playgroups starting in their own areas , what was more natural than their becoming known as voluntary area organizers ? Originally it was a question of befriending , advising , visiting ; making personal contact with the Medical Officer of Health to offer help to those about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for grants ( almost never available ) ; or for help with courses for those realizing that they did not know enough . In those early days it was exhausting and often thankless work . The idea was too new ; there was no money in local authority coffers ; the under-fives were nothing to do with education ' . ' Over-burdened Health Authorities had their work cut out to inspect and pass premises and intending playgroup leaders , and many were reluctant to involve themselves additionally in being concerned about the quality of play . Now , nearly thirteen years later , there are new lessons to be learned , and the first residential weekends for area organizers have been held both north and south of the border , as they try to build the future on the past . In a sense pre-school education is accepted as a necessity , and playgroups have become part of our national way of life ; P P A is an acknowledged influence in their development , and in the evolution of playgroup courses for those involved in the work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace- // makers ; the birth pangs are over and development is calling for new qualities . An area organizer needs to have an awareness of her own strengths and weaknesses , to be able to pace herself , and to be able to recognize different temperaments and personalities , in order that she shall not expect too much , or too little , from those with whom she works . Everyone has many strengths , and several weaknesses . The weaknesses may not matter ? as long as they are known . In many counties there is a splendid team built up on the strength of knowing weaknesses . It 's a case of I 'm hopeless visiting playgroups , but I 'm good on organization ' ; or I love the mothers and children , but I get letters and money into a ghastly muddle . ' An ambassador to local authorities and councillors needs to be someone who inspires confidence ; someone who can marshal her facts ; who knows what to ask for , and when to ask for it ; who knows the code of professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The personality of area organizers visiting playgroups is allimportant . Some , with the best will in the world , leave a playgroup ruffled , unsure , or even downright angry . Others revive morale , inspire , and are instrumental in helping a poor playgroup to become a valuable one . Others have no effect at all , the playgroup people are quite pleased to see her , quite enjoy her visit , and are quite glad to see her go . Considerable maturity is needed if visiting is to achieve tangible results . Speaking engagements come thick and fast , to speak to Women 's Institutes , Young Wives , Townswomen 's Guilds , Parent-Teacher Associations , the local councillors or a new playgroup . Area organizers who do this need to be free of bees In their bonnets . Dogmatism is likely to defeat the very points they most wish to make . Help is needed by most area organizers before they feel ready to speak to open meetings . Area organizers need to know where to send people with ! special needs ; each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clinics , departments , and to know the channels through which they can be approached . There are now over three hundred area organizers , and among them are many outstanding women . Sadly , many people are prevented from doing this work for lack of finance . Travelling 109 ? THE PLAYGROUP MOVEMENT expenses need to be realistic , and hidden expenses recognized ? it is not always possible to do baby-sitting on a reciprocal basis . Broadly speaking , area organizers fall into two categories , the short term and the long term . Short-term area organizers . These are likely to be women involved in the running of their own playgroups , whose interest and abilities have grown to the point when they feel able to respond to the needs of other playgroup people . Powers of leadership and organization grow as people turn to them and lean on them : their concern overrides their diffidence , and they undertake the daunting task of establishing contact with the various local authorities in order to ask for local playgroup courses , facilities for bulk buying through the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special needs , rent reductions , transport for needy children , speakers for meetings , etc . Sometimes they are stretched , strained and used ' to near breaking point , and in their turn they need someone to lean on . The more experienced area organizers and the members of the national executive committee offer personal support by letter , phone and visits during these periods of stress , but in many cases this personal support and encouragement comes from the very members of the local authority who had once seemed so awe-inspiring and distant . ' The most characteristic comment of these new area organizers is If anyone had told me a year ago that I should be doing these things , I would never have believed them ! ' After two or three years their own children have gone on to school , and the sphere of interest changes ; or lack of money sends them into part-time employment ; or husbands feel that the situation is growing out-of-hand , and call for readjustment . Whatever the reason , they resign from their voluntary appointment , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Long-term area organizers . Quite often these are older women who have been in the playgroup movement from the beginning , but some who thought they would only be short // term ' find that they wish to continue . They have learned to balance home commitments ; their knowledge of playgroups is comprehensive ; they have a grasp of the local situation , and the wisdom and ability to handle emotional crises ; they have established good relationships with the local authorities and are adept at encouraging new playgroups in the areas that most need them . Many of these women are driven by a quiet conviction that what they are doing is worthwhile and several of them have undertaken part-time employment in another sphere in order to earn enough money to continue their voluntary work without detriment to the family . But now many of these women are resigning , and the playgroup movement can ill afford to lose some of them . There are three main reasons for their resignation . Firstly , many have gone on to do teacher training , in the certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next twenty years . Secondly , the strain of both a money-earning job and the work of an area organizer is too great . And the one can not be continued without the other . And thirdly , those who have worked gladly and voluntarily for many years eventually reach the point where they feel that they must make a financial contribution to the family ; so they resign , and all too frequently become squarish-pegs in money-earning round holes . Sometimes these women apply for local posts as playgroup advisers . But sometimes they have no paper qualifications , or their previous training was ( apparently ) irrelevant , and they feel unable to apply . Yet their worth in the playgroup field is proven . What is the answer ? One answer is for a local authority grant to be given to the branch or county association , to be spent in the way that would most benefit the non-profit-making playgroups . In this sort of situation the committee usually decides that nothing is as valuable as someone to give advice and support , so the right person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a very obvious tower of strength and wisdom in the person of the unqualified , or irrelevantly qualified , area organizer . In such a situation , there may be a unanimous decision to appoint her to do exactly what she is at present doing voluntarily : from then on everyone has // a clear conscience , and the relationship between the members , their newly acquired status symbol , and the local authorities becomes clean cut , professional and more effective . But such a person usually prefers to be called an organizer rather than an adviser . In one county such an organizer was appointed for a year by the County Association of PPA when a local trust fund gave a once-only gift of ? 100 . The energy and purpose that followed from this honorarium were out of all proportion to the gift . At the end of the year the honorarium became a salary , subsidised by a grant from the Local Education Authority . Later , the ( then ) Health Department and Education Department jointly paid the salary and expenses of a part-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organizer . The work is shared , each having knowledge and experience that overlaps the other 's , but each finding that she is making her own niche in the playgroup community . The organizer finds that queries directed to her tend to fall into four categories : People . How do you cope with apathetic parents ? How do you manage a rota , or other voluntary help ? How do you decide who is paid , and who is not ? What do other people pay staff ? How do you pay them ? Who needs National Insurance , Industrial Injuries Insurance ? Where are the courses ? Who can attend ? Can people be sponsored to attend by , say , the playgroup committee ? Premises . Rent , heating and other costs ? what do others pay ? Why do some church halls charge no rent but ask for a donation instead ? How do you use storage to the best advantage ? Do you need written agreements about rent and the use of the hall ? How do you learn to get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insurance do you need for children , staff and equipment ? What is covered by the landlord ? Administration . How do you form a committee and adopt a constitution ? // How do you inform parents about costs and other money matters ? How do you explain when fees have to be increased to meet rising costs ? How do you charge ? Hourly ? Daily ? Weekly ? Term in advance ? Do you charge when children are away ? What do you do if you do n't get the payment ? What do other people charge ? How do you hold a parents ' meeting to sort out money or staff problems ? Open days and publicity . How do you overcome local hostility or lack of interest ? What are the legal requirements about raising money ? How do you link up with the local primary school ? How do you get to see other playgroups ? How can you get them to see that you do n't want to criticize , but you want to see what they do ? How do you involve secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that the most I can be is a listening ear , and someone able to suggest solutions , or where they could find the help , advice or information that they require . ' Her own acquired knowledge on these matters is now considerable , and although much of it can be disseminated during playgroup courses there comes a time in the life of most playgroups when they need someone to sit down with them all to discuss the burning issue of the moment . Playgroups are penetrating ever more deeply into areas where the above questions are too difficult to be solved without outside help ; and if the adviser has to attend to this side of the work , what will become of the endless queue waiting for advice on how to cope with difficult children , and how to arrange a room to the best advantage , all of which are additional to her tutoring playgroup courses ? Both aspects of the work need to be covered . This needs to be stressed , for already valuable area organizers are saying , Now an adviser is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good playgroup is an extension of the home for both mother and child ( father too , whenever possible ) and the social servicing 113 a THE PLAYGROUP MOVEMENT is just as important as the educational servicing . Both are essential . The Scottish Social Work Services Group sponsored a series of residential conferences , with expenses paid , for playgroup organizers . Those invited to the conference included representatives of local authorities , the voluntary area organizers of the Scottish PPA , and representatives of the Church of Scotland . ' If playgroups are to be relevant to their own communities there must be time for those working in widely different areas to meet , talk , think and plan together . This is especially true when it comes to working at training courses at various levels . One residential weekend deserves special mention . It was arranged as a family occasion , and accommodation was booked in a chalet hotel : for some it was the first time they had stayed in a hotel as a family , and the children were filled with a sense of occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploring or to the zoo . But it was during the Saturday evening that the most valuable period came , when the husbands began to talk about their own attitudes to their wives ' involvement with playgroups . Several wives commented that they had never heard their husbands so articulate before ; neither had they realized that their husbands were proud of them , and that the usual banter hid real pleasure . County Many counties now have more than half a dozen area organizers , and in order to streamline organization , and cut down on unneccessary travelling in such a situation they often appoint one of their number to be the county organizer . Local authorities find it less confusing to deal with one person , and in addition to forming the link between the local authorities and the playgroup people she is also to co-ordinate the work of the team of area organizers . Whether or not she still has time for visiting playgroups depends on geography in many areas , though most feel the need to keep in close touch with the children in their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all others that playgroup people need is to be able to exchange ideas , compare notes , and seek solutions to common problems . So branches came into being , starting with two or more playgroups which were members of PPA , having a constitution that was acceptable to the Department of Education and Science as being of charitable status , and officers who were individual members of PPA . This closed shop lasted for some time , for members still felt at this point that only by banding together to proclaim the value of parent involvement could they hope to make any local , or national impact . It was possible to stipulate that playgroups had to have at least one member who belonged to PPA though it was not possible to guarantee that all the playgroups were a good advertisement for PP A. It was possible to stipulate that playgroups had to have parent involvement , but precisely what constituted involvement ? Some mothers did their rota duty , but felt press-ganged rather than involved ; others did not do rota duty but felt themselves to be deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and styles of the playgroups varied widely . Who was competent to decide , and how , which were good playgroups ? And what could be done about bad groups ? In 1967 membership began to rise steeply , but non-PPA playgroups began to proliferate even more rapidly , and quantity prevailed over quality . Concern for children in these playgroups outside the branch moved several branches to reconsider the PPA-playgroup-only rule : many of them came to the independent conclusion that children mattered more than rules , and they threw membership open to everyone . It worked , up to a point , for at least isolates were drawn together in a branch ; they were invited to visit other playgroups ; they had a chance to consider other ways of running groups ; they had a chance to hear informed speakers and to see films and exhibitions of children 's genuine unaided painting and makings . The National Executive recognized the wisdom in this new thinking , and the ruling was changed ; only the branch officers were required to be PPA members . This was considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened members worked . // In some areas the Directors of Education furthered PPA ' S aims by only giving the concession of buying materials and equipment cheaply through the supplies officer to branch members : this brought in even more members . The fact that they joined for reasons of personal gain was considered immaterial ? what mattered was that there was now a chance to influence the playgroups indirectly for the benefit of the children . The branches and area organizers became the strongest force for good in the playgroup world , together with the proliferation of playgroup courses , and precious time spared by a few local authority advisers and playgroup course tutors . Often the branches had grown directly out of the first course to be held in an area , for at the end of it people wanted to go on meeting together . Some of the present 300 branches are so highly organized , and have proved to be so effective , that local authorities are making them grants . The amounts can vary from ? 25 to ? 9000 ( 1971 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is largely a question of geography that decides whether the first coming-together of playgroups shall be to form a branch or a county association . It is almost always young urban families moving out to rural areas who start playgroups in the country ; their own needs are as urgent as those of their children , and they will travel miles to make contact with someone else running a playgroup . Eventually the few pioneers decide to band together officially in order to be able to negotiate more effectively with local authorities . Many of them realize that strangers of a few years ' residence in a village are unlikely to be listened to , so they ask local people in public life if they would set the wheels in motion . This works well , and a county association is launched with strong local backing . When such a county association calls a committee meeting in the first year or two of its existence it is not at all unusual for members to travel 150 miles ( at their own cost ) to attend . But slowly the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually in the areas where the first enthusiasts live . // In some areas the first branch draws members together from isolated areas all over the county . Usually they carry the whole burden themselves , and struggle on without outside help until membership widens enough for the first unwieldy branch to split up into smaller branches . In other areas local branches come first , and are later co-ordinated by a county association . REGIONS The first regions , formed in 1967 , were the Scottish and Irish Pre-school Playgroups Associations . Each has it own executive committee and constitution , and works within a framework related to local laws ; but both these regions feel themselves to be integral parts of the whole Pre-school Playgroups Association . The third region to be formed was the south west . This was a natural geographical development for here isolation is more than a matter of miles . Cornwall has so much coastline that there is only one direction in which to travel for help . There was only a single playgroup in Cornwall to begin with , and the pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came about that Exeter became the focal point for trains and cars , and a region slowly came into being . Growing enthusiasm for playgroups later led to the formation of the Cornish Association for the Pre-School Child , and the Devonshire Pre-School Playgroups Association . Now branches are forming within the county associations . Flexibility has been the keyword at every stage , for situations have to be accepted as they are , rather than as an administrator would wish them to be . WHAT OF THE FUTURE ? The principle of live and let live has worked well ; on the whole , the low-populated areas started with large regional or county associations , and are breaking down into branch units . The more populated areas started with branches , and are working up and outward to form county associations and regions . The aim is to form regions to coincide with Her Majesty 's Inspectorate divisions , these to come naturally and in their own // good time . In this sort of organization you do not say to overworked young parents , You 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get cracking ! ' As and when it happens ( and it is coming ) each region will elect its representative to the national executive Committee . MEMBERSHIP This is currently ( 1973 ) under review , for live and let live is easy enough when the others ' are over there ' . Now the country is being welded into a whole , the much more difficult give-andtake phase has arrived . The struggle to provide an ever-growing income , whilst trying to mount an even faster growing daily service , will continue . Those who need most time and attention can least afford to contribute towards the cost of its provision . The national association is working towards a form of subscription that will incorporate both local and national membership and be acceptable to a diversity of playgroups . THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The national executive committee is composed of members nominated by the regions , plus such co-options as are needed , and ex-officio members . All of them come from within the movement itself . To confine a committee with such heavy responsibilities to young unknowns might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness is probably PPA 'S greatest strength . Throughout seven years of working with this slowly changing committee ( members are appointed for three years , with reelection giving a maximum of six years ) it has become apparent that again and again the professional answer would have been the wrong answer . It is precisely because these men and women know the job that they are so willing and able to seek new ways of meeting new needs . It is because almost all of them are parents , professionals in their own sphere , do-it-yourself decorators , children 's sick-room attendants , cooks , householders , neighbours , marriage partners and voluntary workers , that they know from present personal experience the strains placed upon modern families . It is because they constantly needed // to be listened to , understood and guided by nursery school and other professionals in their early playgroup days that they come to the national executive committee so ready both to go on listening to the members and to continue to seek guidance themselves . The first break away from promotion from the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Education in London University , became a very active President , constantly available for discussion and advice at a very critical period . Personal consultation is also continuous with the Department of Health and Social Security , the Home Office , the Social Work Services Group in Scotland , and the Department of Education and Science . Contact with the latter has been particularly close in view of the fact that it was their grant to PPA in 1967 which made a three-year survey of playgroups possible : ' each new stage of development concerning playgroup courses has been put before them , the failures as well as the successes , as careful progress is made towards a nationally recognized series of playgroup courses ; and a cautious start was made on the first experimental tutors ' course in 1969 . During the time of writing the professions represented on the committee have included a doctor and vicar , several graduates , several teachers , two Froebel nursery school teachers , a Froebel training college lecturer , a graduate chartered accountant , a company secretary , a biologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistician and researcher , a journalist and editor , two secretaries , a nurse , and two ministers ' wives . Several of them had worked in deeply deprived areas , and almost without exception they had worked in playgroups . But the unbroken chain of experience runs through the movement , from the mothers and children in the playgroups up through the playgroup leaders , the area organizers , the county organizers and the regional representatives to the executive . The consolidated experience of the last eleven years has crystallized into the recognition that the emphasis has widened from What can we do to help children ? ' to What can we do . // to help parents to help their own children , thereby becoming happier people themselves ? ' This new situation calls for new thinking , and the combined experience of each successive committee is highly relevant to the task in hand . THE CENTRAL OFFICE This has progressed slowly from papers kept in chests of drawers , boxes and suitcases in members ' homes to more official quarters in 1966 . This first office was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a second-hand portable typewriter and a gay geranium in a pot to welcome the first part-time helper who rejoiced in the dignified title Office Staff ' . Before sitting down to work she went to buy an old desk , a single chair and two trestle tables . Work multiplied alarmingly , and another part-time helper was appointed for whom another desk and chair were found : membership was now 1500 , and a well-used duplicator and some gas heaters were purchased . In 1968 the demolition date arrived , and two tiny rooms were rented in Southwark . By this time the membership was 7500 and additional help was needed at crisis points : there were by then two new typewriters , an electric duplicating machine , an addressograph and , eventually , a plate-making machine with various attachments . Two years later a basement room was rented for the storage and packing of publications , but even this proved to be inadequate for the 10,000 booklets and pamphlets sent out each year . The gallery of a chapel in Leighton Buzzard was used to store the overflow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each term one member 's family car had to stand in the garden while the bundles of Playgroup News took up the cubic space which it formerly occupied . Additional part-time help for the original stalwarts was provided , and a telephone installed for outgoing calls ( incoming ones would have disrupted the work disastrously ) . Between eighty and a hundred letters were being answered each day , in addition to the renewal of thousands of subscriptions , the duplicating of executive papers , Branch and Area Organizers ' newsletters , and reports from the NEC officers and national adviser . 120
