During their winter months of June , July and August , Brazilian coffeegrowers observe a time-honored ritual : they spread rumors of crop-killing frosts in hopes of pushing up coffee prices on commodity exchanges . Hence there was nothing out of the ordinary about reports of a " White Friday " last month - except that this time the stories turned out to be true . For the first time since 1943 , snow fell in the southern state of Paran , which produces half of Brazil 's coffee . In neighboring Sao Paulo state , frost damaged 50% to 70% of the coffee trees . The effect on prices was instant . Within a week of the frost , coffee rose from 52 to 84 per Ib. on the London commodities market , as nervous traders rushed to snap up supplies in case of a shortage . In Rio de Janeiro , supermarkets lifted prices 53 , to $1.29 per Ib . And in the U.S. last week , the General Foods Corp . hiked its wholesale prices for grocery brands ( including Maxwell House ) by 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze-dried and instant . Other wholesalers planned similar increases . Some experts fear the price of a cup of coffee in New York could double to 50 . <P> If so , it would be a triumph of panic over economic logic . The snow and frost did not change estimates that Brazil 's 1975-76 coffee crop will total 21 million bags , because they damaged only the future ability of coffee trees to bear berries , not the berries hanging on the trees now . Production will indeed drop during the following two crop years ; it might be cut in half during 1976-77 . Still , no major shortage looks likely . Brazil has reserves of 21 million bags that could be sold to keep exports close to normal levels over the next three years , until newly planted trees yield a crop . Any slack could be taken up by other producers , primarily in Colombia , who will benefit greatly from the higher prices . Those prices may enable Brazil to earn $500 million more on coffee sales in the next twelve months than it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of White Friday , however , could indirectly reduce Brazil 's output over the longer run . The Brazilian government is eager to see coffee planting moved northward , away from the danger of frost , so it may encourage growers in Paran and Sao Paulo to switch to soybeans . But if new areas of cultivation do not open up quickly , Brazil 's exportable crop , which accounted for 32% of the world coffee trade in 1974-75 , could fall drastically .
