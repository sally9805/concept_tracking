Way back in 1961 , British Actress Susan Hampshire had a bash at Hollywood . Or , as she called it , " the Land of the Bottom Pinchers , " where all the men have " crocodile wives and ulcers and gold-and-diamond rings they twist around their hairy fingers . The big shots also had arms they kept putting around me that managed to be long enough to reach my left breast . " Susan recalls telling them : " I do n't have to do that . I can act . " So she returned home to become an international star-her way . <P> Her latest acknowledgment came this year in the U.S. , where she has emerged as , of all things , the first sex symbol of educational television ( if one ignores Julia Child ) . Susan is Fleur , the exquisite arch-bitch of The Forsyte Saga , a role for which she last week won an Emmy Award as the best actress in a dramatic series . In most of the 40-odd other countries that have been enthralled by the greatest soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Norway a mob of 60,000 turned out to see her-in a town of only 10,000 . <P> Dyslexia Praecox . Susan started out with what should have been an insuperable handicap for an actress . She had dyslexia , a congenital brain condition that hampers her ability to read aloud . She still aches at memories of trying to get through London 's Hampshire School ( founded by her mother ) . " I remember standing up in class trying to read Shakespeare , and I could hear all the other children sniggering and laughing , because I 'd be literally making it up . I remember thinking : when I grow up , people are not going to laugh at me . So I thought , who do they respect now ? Elizabeth Taylor or someone . I 'll be an actress . " <P> Finally , at age 16 , she gave up school and went into repertory . She had learned to read silently and to remember her parts , but auditions and first readings were , as she says , " torture .

" But 18 months , two companies , and more than 100 roles later , she finally arrived on the West End , playing a show-stopping cameo in Expresso Bongo with Paul Scofield . <P> BBC work , the Sidney Furie film During One Night , and Hollywood followed . By the end of her stay there , the bottom pinchers and a California crime scare had reduced her to sleeping with a tear-gas gun under her pillow . She was also scared off by the proffered parts , some of the available co-stars ( " I had never acted opposite a brick wall before " ) , and the long-indenturing contracts proposed by two studios . After five months , she headed home with nothing to show but a 30,000-word journal , a real-life Nathanael West work that is too libelous to publish . <P> But once back in London , she was not above playing the starlet publicity game . Her main purpose was to try to free herself from the molasses morass of Disney pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sweet , soppy , boring " debutante roles in which she was stuck . At one point , a columnist quoted her as saying she needed " somebody like Roger Vadim to bring me to full bloom . "
