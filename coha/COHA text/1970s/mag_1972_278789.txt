On Aug. 15 , the Nixon Administration will celebrate the first anniversary of wage-price controls-but celebrate may not be quite the word . The date also happens to be the deadline for companies with annual revenues of $50 million or more to submit second-quarter profit reports to the Price Commission . Those filings could touch off the first serious clash between price controllers and business executives . <P> The problem is a regulation that companies winning permission to raise prices must not push their profit margins-that is , their percentage of profit on each dollar of sales-above those of a base period . If they do , they must cut prices . For most companies , the base is the average of the two best years in the period from 1968 through 1970 . So far , this rule has not hurt industry much ; corporate profits surged to a record rate in the first quarter ( see chart ) without subjecting too many companies to rollbacks , and even those firms have not necessarily suffered . In order to get within its profit-margin ceiling , Bruno 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham , had to institute bargain-basement prices : 990 per Ib. for choice steak , $1.07 for three pounds of coffee . " It is O.K. with me , " says Owner Joe Bruno . Since the price cuts , sales have zoomed . <P> The second-quarter reports , however , are expected to disclose many more companies exceeding their profit-margin ceilings . Alan Greenspan , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , figures that sooner or later at least one company in every major industry will pierce its ceiling and be forced to cut prices . That , he fears , will be enough to crimp corporate profits generally , because price reductions by one company would have to be followed by all its competitors - including some with narrow profit margins that would be further squeezed . <P> Businessmen then would likely scream for relief , and Nixon and his advisers would face an awkward dilemma . If they ordered the Price Commission to relent , they would risk angering consumers , but if they let the commission go ahead , businessmen might cut back on expansion plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus chilling the economy 's recovery . <P> Some things can be done to avert a showdown . Companies in danger of bumping against their profit-margin ceilings could pour more money into such activities as advertising and research and development , thereby reducing immediate profits but also perhaps increasing their share of the market . Willard F. Rockwell Jr. , chairman of Rockwell Manufacturing Co. , Pittsburgh-based maker of valves , meters and power tools , views the necessity of complying with margin ceilings as a chance to " give my competitors a good kick in the pants .
