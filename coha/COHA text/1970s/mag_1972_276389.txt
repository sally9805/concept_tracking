After a meeting with West German Chancellor Willy Brandt three weeks ago , French President Georges Pompidou was asked whether he thought the proposed " Summit of Ten " - the long-awaited meeting of the six European Economic Community nations , plus the four candidate countries-would actually be held . Replied Pompidou : " It will be like the Olympics . The final will decide . " <P> Last week the final was in fact held in Rome , where Foreign Ministers of the six member nations plus Britain agreed that the summit should proceed as scheduled on Oct. 19-21 . It is billed as a meeting to set guidelines for Europe for the next decade , and will have a full agenda including preparations for a European Security Conference , a Common Market policy toward developing countries and community measures against terrorism . <P> Even so , last week 's agreement represented something of a failure of French diplomacy , in that Paris appeared to bend to the will of its partners instead of the other way around . All summer France had threatened to sabotage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political secretariat in Paris and decide on a joint trade policy toward the rest of the world , specifically the U.S. In effect France 's partners had now called Paris ' bluff-and won .
