txt Spain 's execution of five terrorists is disrupting the West and aiding communism more than any world incident since the American invasion of Cambodia . The five have become martyrs in a protest movement which makes it possible for the communists throughout Western Europe to put themselves arm in arm with socialists , liberals , moderates , and intellectuals . It hasended their political isolation of recent years . In effect , it has put them back in business . Peking seems to be appalled at the spectacle of an event which is so much to the advantage of Moscow . It is saying virtually nothing at all . Chinese foreign policy has been to encourage unity among Western democracies . That unity is being seriously damaged . American support for Spain is once again opening a rift between Washington and Western Europe . This is obviously regarded as bad news in Peking . Moscow treats it in a calculated tone of " more in sorrow than in anger . " Its press and radio avoid the shrill note of protest . It can afford to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West again have a popular bandwagon which they can board and then attempt to control . The worst immediate damage is in Portugal . There the political moderates and centrists were just getting a government formed and in operation with excellent chances ofsuccess when the Spanish incident gave the communists a golden opportunity to take to the streets again with a popular rallying cry . The once bright hope for a moderate solution to Portugal 's political problems is in danger . The damage inside Spain can become worse . There is a sudden political repolarization . Many on both sides of the Spanish political divide begin again to think in terms of civil war . Spanish nationalism has been enflamed // * Spain gives communism a fresh opening // by the wave of anti-Spanish sentiment which has swept over the rest of Europe . It has been assumed for a generation that the memory of the Spanish civil war of the 1930s was a sure safeguard against another . That assumption now is in question . An immediate casualty is the effort to end Spain 's isolation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American project for a decade . Progress was impressive . Suddenly , the rest of Europe is repelled by an act in Spain which ? no matter how justified in many Spanish eyes ? seemed unconscionable to the rest of Europe . The five were terrorists . But two of them were Basque nationalists for whom there is much sympathy in other European countries . The Pope had urged the Spaniards to refrain from the executions . They plunged ahead . Travel and communication between Spain and the rest of Europe is down to a trickle . Spain has re-isolated itself . Communists in Europe have had a poor time since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the beginning of the American withdrawal from Vietnam . Through all of Western Europe those twin events put them on the defensive . Mostly they lay low , went dormant , or concentrated ? as in Italy ? on making a new image for themselves as good citizens . They themselves were in bad odor for the shameful deed in Czechoslovakia , even though most of them had publicly repudiated it . And Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda campaign . They have been long without any good propaganda vehicle . There is , of course , a limit on how far they can ride this particular vehicle . After all , the executed five had killed policemen ? and that is a crime in any society . Damage-control operations are under way . Washington is doing what it can to try to prevent the re-isolation of Spain from settling into a fixed pattern . The wave of popular revulsion against Spain may subside as suddenly as it surged up . But we have before us right now a startling reminder that there are communist parties in every Western European country , that these parties are always ready to seize a popular cause when one comes along , and that once seized they know how to make good use of it . In this case they have already used it to delay a return to political stability in Portugal and to head off the American project of a reconciliation between Spain and the NATO allies . The moral of the affair of course is : Do n't give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five ( in Spain ) has become one of those . events which shakes the political pattern of every country in Europe . It is like the reaction to Soviet tanks surging into Budapest or Prague . Everyone feels it . Those events did untold damage to communism . In Western Europe no communist party ever really recovered from them . But now Spain provides a partial antidote . What a pity !
