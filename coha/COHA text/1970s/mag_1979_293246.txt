" General Motors does n't want people wandering around on their own in there , " says a student guard . He points to the fence beyond which innocent-looking woods and fields stretch away through southern Michigan . The only authorized way in proves to be a shuttle bus . Bearing two Chrysler engineers and an average American car owner , pitifully eager for any word of mileage efficiency to come , it cruises along winding roads with nothing except trees in view . Nothing , that is , until the road opens on a vast stretch of black tarmac , 67 acres of it , set in the hills near Milford , a GM proving ground . Right in the middle , three circus-like tents and a maze of yellow rubber cones point skyward like the towers of some futuristic Camelot . A long line of odd-looking vehicles is strung out in front of them . Some appear to have wings . Some look like your average tired little foreign sedan . One , with a bright red body but made mostly of glass , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk swiftly head for the spot in the line where the car brought by a team of student engineers from the University of Minnesota sits . A mumble of talk ensues about the interesting hydraulic " hybrid " gas engine the team has built . <P> The humble car owner does not really understand hybrids ( engineer jargon for automobiles that use more than one source of power-like a diesel engine combined , with a battery-powered engine , for example ) . What he really wants is a decent replacement for his air-conditioned , 8-m.p.g. ' 71 Chevy Impala . He was pretty disappointed when the so-called Moodymobile raised hopes and made headlines by getting from Florida to Washington , D.C. , at 84 m.p.g. only to flunk its EPA emissions test . <P> It is the second day of the S.C.O.R.E . ( student competitions on relevant engineering ) , an " energy-efficient vehicle competition . " Thirty-four cars from 28 different colleges and universities in the U.S. and Canada are on hand . If they do not have a better idea , who does ? <P> S.C.O.R.E . officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonprofit , Boston-based organization founded to promote " handson " engineering technology in North American schools . The Detroit manufacturers usually contribute not merely the testing site but also special testing equipment and engineers who serve as judges . James Paisley of GM 's product planning group and his partner , John A. Nattress of the University of Florida , are scheduled to review the experimental-car contestants on something called " costs to the consumer . " The bemused car owner finds Paisley and Nattress hard at work on the line evaluating a front-wheel-drive , hydrogen-powered , hydraulic-assisted entry from the University of Wisconsin 's Stout campus . Even with some donated parts , the exotic power plant modestly housed in a blue Dodge Omni body cost $25,000 in cash . Student Steve Mann insists that the car would be " as cheap as or cheaper " than any current production model to massproduce . Mann is young and tousle-headed . But with poise beyond his years he points out that if society were to switch from petroleum-based fuels to hydrogen , fuel would cost the consumer only about 180 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ten years before people realize there are oceans of water out there full of hydrogen .
