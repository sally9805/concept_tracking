The various elements evoke images of a British coronation , a Spanish bullfight and an ancient Roman circus , but the total tableau is strictly from The Bronx . It invariably happens late in the ball game . The starting pitcher is tired , the home team 's lead is threatened , and help is needed . The gate in Yankee Stadium 's right-centerfield fence swings open and a Datsun painted in pinstripes taxis a relief pitcher toward the diamond . Eyes strain to see who is inside the car , voices murmur , hopes rise . The car stops , the stadium organist sweeps into the regal strains of Pomp and Circumstance , and the crowd exults . Out steps Albert Walter ( " Sparky " ) Lyle . He sheds his warmup jacket with measured nonchalance and strides toward the pitcher 's mound , one cheek distended by chewing tobacco . A few practice throws , a couple of spits , and Sparky is once again ready to try to quell a crisis . <P> With astonishing consistency , Sparky succeeds . Pitching in most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 28-year-old lefthander has compiled the best record of any relief pitcher in either league . Going into last weekend 's action , he was credited with having saved 28 games , won four and lost three . ( Only Clay Carroll of the Cincinnati Reds in the National League was close to him , with 24 saves , five victories and four defeats . ) With some 40 games yet to play , Lyle has a good chance of breaking the major league season record of 34 saves , set by Ron Perranoski of the Minnesota Twins in 1970 . <P> Statistics alone do not reflect a relief pitcher 's effectiveness . Saves are credited when a pitcher protects any sort of lead , big or small . In Sparky Lyle 's case , most of his saves have come in crucial situations . For instance , there was his performance in a game against the Texas Rangers in June . Summoned to the mound in the eighth inning , with the Yankees leading 3-2 , Ranger runners on second and third , and no one out , Lyle intentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced . Then , with the bases loaded , he coolly struck out the next three batters on ten pitches . <P> Sparky professes not to think about the pressure during a game , or about the score after it is over . " If I come in and save or win a game , " he says , " I just did my job . Why celebrate ? That victory is in . The game is over . I might have to do it again tomorrow . If I lose , why moan ? I hate to let runs score , but I ca n't get uptight . If I worry about ruining a game today , then I might wreck one tomorrow . When a game is over , forget it . " Forget it he does . Win or lose , Lyle is always the life of the Yankee locker room . His most curious antic is to plant his bare backside on any particularly gooey cakes that find their way into the locker room . It all started when he played for the Boston Red Sox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when the teammate later received a cake as a gift , Lyle promptly retaliated by sitting on it .
