Big washout ahead <P> For more than a decade , the fastest thing about the fast-food industry has been its growth-in outlets , sales and profits . No area of the business has prospered more than the giant hamburger chains , dominated by McDonald 's and its two smaller cook-alikes , Burger King and Wendy 's . But lately , increasing costs and competition have taken some of the sizzle out of the chains . Says Wendy 's Chairman R. David Thomas : " There 's a big washout coming . " <P> The chains still have room to grow , and their earnings , though slowing somewhat , will probably remain strong by any standards . But there is a growing consensus in and out of the industry that the old days of runaway expansion are over and a tough period of scrambling for new customers and healthy returns lies ahead . A basic problem has been the rising cost of food , especially meat ; beef prices jumped 30% last year , and some experts say they could increase by 50% this year . The chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised its prices last year by about 14% . But higher costs are causing people to order down-to pass up the $1.05 Big Mac for a 500 regular hamburger , buy smaller portions of French fries and cut out dessert . <P> Another factor has been the increase in the minimum wage , which went from $2.65 to $2.90 on Jan. 1 . Higher fuel prices and gasoline shortages may also hurt the chains because people will be less inclined to drive out for a meal . Indeed there has been a quick rise in supermarket sales of fast-food fixin 's to prepare at home . <P> Meanwhile , the hamburger heavyweight , McDonald 's , is being challenged by hungry competitors , notably Burger King , a subsidiary of Pillsbury Co . McDonald 's 5,200 outlets , which account for about 20% of the $20 billion spent last year on fast food , generated earnings of $163 million on sales of $4.6 billion in 1978 . McDonald 's opened 500 new outlets last year and expects to continue expanding at that pace for the next three to five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual earnings growth , which dropped to 19% last year from roughly 40% five years ago . Since last fall the average month-to-month sales rise at McDonald 's stores , which used to be 9% , has slipped to 5% . Reflecting these developments , McDonald 's stock has declined from the 1978 high of $60 a share to last week 's close of $41.25 . McDonald 's plans to continue to direct its $200 million-a-year advertising campaign toward kids , but it will also begin pushing more vigorously for the adult trade . Its breakfast business is growing , and the company is experimenting at selected sites with a dinner menu that includes chicken pot pies and fried chicken sandwiches . <P> Burger King , with 2,500 outlets the second largest chain , plans to open about 350 new ones this year . Though Pillsbury does not report separate sales and profit figures for Burger King , analysts believe that the chain is expected to manage better than its rivals . A major reason : the chain was fastest in diversifying its menu . Besides hamburgers , it offered chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
