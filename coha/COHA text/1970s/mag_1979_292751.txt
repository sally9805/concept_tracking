Kenneth Uston resigned as a $42,500-a-year senior vice president of the Pacific Stock Exchange four years ago to become a professional blackjack player . He is good . Too good for the casinos to handle . Uston is known as a " counter , " because he can keep track of the cards so well that he can determine if those remaining will tip the odds in his favor . <P> Last week the Resorts International casino in Atlantic City followed the precedent of Las Vegas gaming houses and decided to deal Uston , and at least ten other known counters , out of the game . The casino had cause for alarm : Uston was winning at the rate of $700 an hour and had accumulated $43,000 in chips in about 60 hours of playing when he was informed of the ban . Undaunted , Uston plans to file a complaint with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission . He also may continue to place a few chips on the sly : " Maybe I 'll try my Dr. Wasserman disguise , " he said , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I wear thick glasses and a Brooks Brothers suit with a Shriners pin on it . " It fools everybody-until he starts raking in those chips again .
