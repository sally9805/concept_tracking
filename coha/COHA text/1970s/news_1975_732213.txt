txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor City Crisis : The Bondholders ' Case To the Editor : Reading and listening to discussions of New York 's money problems . I have never encountered any talk about what might happen if the law were obeyed ? if the promise were kept . Bondholders have been promised first right to city tax revenues . What if they should get their money first ? What if National Guard and volunteers were called on to keep people going in some fashion ? This would certainly happen in a natural catastrophe or in a man-made holocaust involving physical destruction . Yet nobody that I 've read or heard about has suggested a rewording of the promise to municipal bondholders either . Nobody has come forward to say that bondholders will be paid interest and principal only after certain essential services are provided for . This , of course , would suggest that a homeowner might be obligated to make mortgage payments only after all insurance premiums , medical costs , utility bills and grocery expenses have been met . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our good conservatives to fight for enforcement of contracts by all our governments . Unless we enforce them or change them explicitly in writing , we have anarchy . SIDNEY C. LUND Rowayton , Conn. , Nov. 5 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Municipal bonds are safe ! After all , the law protects the bondholders . A municipality is required by law to tax its real estate without limit until all bondholders are paid . That is the law . And bondholders come first . They are to be paid before the firemen , the policemen , the Mayor , etc . That is the law . A municipality requires permission from the majority of its bondholders to file for bankruptcy , and it needs the consent of 66 percent of them for any settlement . That is the law . Because municipal bonds were so safe , many people bought them , believing , in good faith , that in the United To the Editor : The offsetting of a penalty for criminal behavior by a " biological sacrifice " is improper and a contradiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case where two child molesters volunteered to be castrated as an alternative to an indeterminate jailing news story Oct. 2 is pleabargaining at its worst and is a warped means of seeking justice . Equally shocking was Judge Woodworth 's consideration of the offer and his ultimate expression of regret that the medical profession had " been unwilling to extend a humanitarian service " to the men . Does the judge believe that the behavioral determinant for molesting is located in the testes of the 45-year-old men , or had the judge agreed to a punishment which fits the crime , at least in his mind ? A less drastic biological sacrifice already being practiced is the offsetting of the penalty for traffic infractions by the giving of a pint of one 's blood . In certain communities in Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Wisconsin individuals guilty of traffic infractions , and unable to pay the fine , have been given the opportunity to offset the fine by " donating " their blood . Aside from the impropriety of this The Price of a License To the Editor : Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to the Motor Vehicle Bureau on Worth Street . Because I had lived in California , I had to be retested even though I have held a New York State driver 's license for twenty years . In the Kafkaesque bureaucratic structure on Worth Street , I was verbally abused , ignored , misinformed , rudely directed and generally treated as if I were a convicted felon and not simply a supplicant for a common driver 's license . While waiting on one more interminable line , a gentleman of Japanese extraction who was having difficulty understanding some of the application jargon was addressed by the clerk : " Hey , Tojo , you do n't know what you 're doin ' . " The rude and abusive clerks do not wear name tags and do n't even acknowledge requests for names when asked  --  so I have no one to " report . " But I must register a protest . It 's had enough to waste almost four hours of my working day in that horror , but to take abuse and rudeness from municipal clerks whose main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are upheld . Included among purchasers of municipal bonds are retired couples , widows , housewives and individuals of moderate means who viewed them as a means of saving . Anyone with $500 or more in hardearned savings could buy bonds , and advertisements in leading newspapers declared them second in safety only to United States Government obligations . No one has a record of how many people own municipal bonds , but we know that there are bond houses that specialize in selling such bonds only to the general public . And now , when a large city is in danger of default , the President of the United States proposes that the bankruptcy laws suddenly be changed to allow a city to pay for " essential services " before bondholders . Of course , such services include fire , police , sanitation , welfare , other city employes  --  everyone except the bondholders . Once he has given his money to keep the city running , he no longer provides a service . And anyway , he is only a filthy capitalist who is trying to avoid paying Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fools then lend their hardearned savings because the law makes it safe for them to do so . However , when an emergency arises , we merely change the law . How convenient . If laws are used in such a way , a government and its laws do not deserve respect . MARTIN SCHECHTER New York , Nov. 6 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Somebody should ask a couple of questions of Moody 's and Standard &; Poor 's concerning their ratings of New York City bonds and notes : What did they know and when did they know it ? If they knew how bad New York 's finances were , sustaining the A rating as long as they did was indefensible , and these rating services should be charged , along with Beame and other officials , with fraud . If they did not know it , they are incompetent . JAMES D. KOERNER Westport , Conn. , Nov. 1 , 1975 deal , what of the individual who is guilty , broke and has had hepatitis ? Will that person admit to having had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blood donor and lead to incarceration based on poor health and having told the truth ? An extreme position on biological sacrifice was stated in The Times Magazine of Nov. 3 , 1974 , when the writer suggested that the shortage of transplantable organs and a judicial problem ( overcrowding of jails ) might be solved by offsetting sentences with a " harvesting " of convicted criminals ' organs . It was suggested that the biological equipalent of a one-year sentence be ten pints of blood ; a fiveyear sentence one kidney ; a ten-year sentence one cornea . No suggestion was made as to what the lifer might contribute , presumably because it would constitute capital punishment or because it might preclude rehabilitation . Biological sacrifice achieved under questionable opportunity for consent and free will would be a barbaric form of therapy . ROBERT P. MAHONEY Assoc .

In brilliant sunshine , two men on their knees bowed to the east today on Eighth Street . They squinted through a subway grating . One held a line weighted with a greased lead sinker . Apparently they had spotted a dime , maybe even a quarter . Will the riots start a few days before Christmas ? JOHN PRICE BELL New York , Nov. 6 , 1975 The Times welcomes Teeters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we aie unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . South Africa 's Ways To the Editor : It has been reported in the South African press that this country 's Ambassador to the U.S.A. and the U.N . told Americans in an extensive radio interview : " You are all the time referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apartheid in the sense that the Government is bent upon keeping peoples from one another  --  peoples who want to join are free to join . " Perhaps His Excellency should have somewhat qualified his assertion . As 5 , GROSS far as individuals are concerned , people of different colors in South Africa are indeed allowed to communicate or " join , " provided they do not worship in the same churches ; provided they do not attend the same schools or universities ; provided they do not use the same toilets or public transport ; provided they do not enjoy cultural , recreational or sports activities together ( except with special permission or permit ) ; provided they do not build their houses in the same areas ; provided they do not share government bodies , trade unions or scientific and arts institutions ; provided they do not fall in love or wish to get married . It is , the Ambassador said , " a voluntary way of life , voluntarily decided upon by all the important leaders in my country . " It should , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is rigidly enforced by probably the most formidable framework of racialistic legislation in the world and , among other things , by a vast organization of Security Police who contribute their voluntary bit in the way of detentions , torture and inexplicable deaths . " All the important leaders in my country " are , of course , part of , or appointed by , the hierarchy of the Nationalist Party . I do not question the Ambassador 's right to defend his country . But I do challenge his obvious assumption that this should be done through lies and distortions . ANDRE P. BRINK Grahamstown , S. Africa , Oct. 27 , 1975 ? The Saigon Regime 's Subtle ' Bloodbath ' To the Editor : In the wake of South Vietnam 's fall to Communist forces , one repeatedly hears the statement , expressed more as a hope than a fact , that conditions in South Vietnam must not be all that bad because there is no clear evidence of a bloodbath . I have been working with Vietnamese refugees in our area . Last week one family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relatives since leaving Saigon in May . Conditions in Saigon are reportedly grim . Everything is scarce , especially food . What little rice is available is of the quality previously used for pig feed . The letter told of a relative who was a war widow . Her husband was in action three years ago . The new Government has denounced her as the wife of the enemy . She is denied the opportunity to work and she and her small children are denied food . This is part of a general policy to deny work and food to any individual , and his relatives , who was in the South Vietnamese military , worked in the previous Government or is connected with someone who evacuated . When I asked a Vietnamese refugee what the motive behind this policy was , he responded that the Communists want their opponents to starve and die . This event is being avoided by many who have committed suicide rather than await a slower but equally certain fate . In North Vietnam a bloodbath followed the Communist take-over by two years , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam it has begun already , if more subtlely . M. GREGG SMITH Salem , Ore. , Nov. 4 , 1975 ? Abba Eban 's ' Doctrine ' To the Editor . Abba Eban 's statement In his Nov. 3 Op-Ed article that there is " no difference whatever " between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is itself an example of the " primitive Jew-baiting " that he decries . For those of Mr. Eban 's mentality , the state of Israel and world Jewry are one . There can be no alternatives : To challenge or delimit the claims of the Israeli state Is , ipso facto , anti-Semitism and , derivatively , neo-Nazism ( a brush always at hand In these discussions ) . To dispute Zionism is to discriminate against Jews , because , as Mr. Eban would have it , Jews can be defined , justified , fulfilled only through Zionism . I find In this Ebanesque doctrine an insidious anti-Semitism that , misrepresenting Jew and non-Jew alike , racially condemns those who refuse assent to the politics of Zionism . PATRICK J.
