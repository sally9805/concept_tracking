" What 's your idea ? " Again and again the Atlantic Richfield oil company asked that question in a six-month , $5.5 million advertising campaign that nagged Americans to send in suggestions for improving mass transportation . The company 's own idea was plain enough . Top executives of Arco , the seventh largest U.S. oil company , were upset by public resentment of the big profits rolled up by the industry in the wake of the 1973-74 price increases . So they decided to do some image polishing by sponsoring a nationwide debate on alternatives to the family car . The response : an astonishing 30,000 ideas from all 50 states ( led by car-choked California ) and 20 foreign countries as well . <P> Early on , Arco worried that all it would get for its efforts would be , well , a lot of gas . Many of the initial suggestions came from motorists who were bitter about fuel price increases and wanted only to pop off at the company . To get the transportation debate on track , Arco 's admen resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two fictional idea contributors played by professional actors : " Juan Martinez , " who proposed a 190-m.p.h. train , and " Amy Farrell , " who suggested truck-drawn land ferries that would carry cars between cities . <P> Bumper Snatchers . Juan and Amy 's planted ideas were purposely kept simple , explains Program Director George Kriste , so that others " would n't think they had to be an engineer to contribute . " That was no problem , to judge by the number of engaging but totally impracticable suggestions that flooded into Arco 's Los Angeles headquarters . For instance , a Chino , Calif. , contributor , Dale Jennings , suggested that ardent energy savers be allowed to ride " Bumper-Snatchers " - lightweight pedicabs that could be hooked onto the bumpers of gas-guzzling regular cars at stop lights or highway ramps for a free ride . Another Californian , Mick McMick , urged that Los Angeles be put on " a revolving ' lazy Susan ' for easy access all around . " John Cody of Lynnfield , Mass. , proposed a suction-tube system to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Hunter of Dayton , Ohio , felt that giant slingshots hi the suburbs could catapult commuters into outsized baseball catcher 's mitts downtown : " Use baby oil to keep the mitt soft , " he advised . <P> A good many proposals , on the other hand , were serious and promising-or at least provocative . A sampling : <P> JITNEY REVIVAL . Some contributors voted for jitneys-cheap , taxi-like buses that pick up passengers at designated points and deliver them to their doors in the most convenient order . Once common , they were banned in most U.S. cities in the 1920s after Intensive lobbying by the trolley industry . <P> " FLY ME " BUSES . People would use buses more , suggested Mrs. Carmen Dinicola of Alexandria , Va. , if they had FM radio channels and served coffee and food " like the airlines . " <P> CANAL COMMUTE . The open aqueducts and flood-control canals that snake to and through many cities might be used for commuter boats . Said Le-Roy Louchart of Fair Oaks , Calif. : " I know I for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
