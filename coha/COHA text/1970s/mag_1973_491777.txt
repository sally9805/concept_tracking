THE SATURDAY EVENING POST July lAugust ' 73 " You Ca n't Go Home Again , " wrote Thomas Wolfe , and went on to demonstrate it , in a novel of a mere hundred thousand words or SO . And now the young artist , Robert Charles Howe , at nineteen , is taking the irrevocable step of leaving the home he was born in . With Bob , as it was with Tom Wolfe , it is the beginning of great things . As the winner of the SatEve  --  Post Norman Rockwell Cover Con  --  test , the virtually self-taught young artist has already appeared on the " Today " show and " To Tell The Truth , " among a number of other TV programs , was featured in As  --  sociated Press articles through the nation 's newspapers , and it might be strange to say that this is only the first step . Yet it is . Bob has studied and painted in private most of his life until now , dedicating himself to art and all its byways  --  the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he assembled a skeleton himself to put meaning into his painting , the bones under the fleshtones ) , and the world around him . But mostly he studied the life and art of Nor  --  man Rockwell , his idol . In fact , he has even been encouraged by Nor  --  man Rockwell himself in his art ef  --  forts . This has n't gone to Bob 's head in the least . He knows better than to compare himself to Norman Rockwell , but he also knows how the master worked and studied and lived , and Bob is determined to emulate him . Norman Rockwell 's greatest stu dio was the world around him . In the places where he lived  --  in his birthplace , New York City ; in New Rochelle ; and then Arlington , Vermont ; and at length today in Stockbridge , Massachu  --  setts  --  he absorbed the America and its people which he painted with such affection and humor . In his extensive travels around the world , he honed his art to a fine point in the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Egypt , and wherenot , were filled with sketches done for the sheer joy of releasing the magic hidden in his eye and brush . These works ( not generally known to the public which so adores his more homely style made famous in The Saturday Evening Post ) would do credit to a Toulouse-Lautrec or a van Gogh . Someday his most casual lines will call forth a pretty penny from millionaire collectors for the merest tracing or outline of a finish-to  --  be ... or perhaps a never-was . Robert Charles Howe labors in a five-by-five basement enclosure converted by his grandfatherfrom a coal bin into a " studio . " There is no natu  --  ral light in it , and barely room to stand back and assay what you have just put on canvas  --  one can get a far better perspective by retreating from the studio and peering around the bulk of the new  --  fangled oil heater which banished the coal in a cause which the art world may some day ap  --  plaud . But here Bob has turned out the work you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which has brought him offers  --  some good and some bad , but all lucrative  --  from magazines , newspapers , catalogues , advertising agencies , and anywhere that visual communication is a rare commodity . But he prefers to do the bidding he feels within him . Even the Post must stand aside when the young artist takes brush in hand and decides what he will paint , his way and no other . And so in this issue , the Post does not have a cover painting by Bob Howe , because he is.in  --  volved in some new art projects of his own , andfurthermore is moving to a new home in Illinois , where -- Bob 's eyes sparkle as he tells about it  --  there are little village streets , a stately church , and variegated people which are the grist of his sketch  --  book mill . For Bob , like Norman Rockwell , makes the wide world his studio . Beyond the coal bin the limit to his scrutiny is the horizon , and the heat that warms is the sun above him . Visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sur  --  rounded by the usual impedimenta of moving time  --  stacks of crates , an exhausted family , and a sense of apprehension that maybe " this is all wrong " ? we came on treasures which mark this as an important point in his life as an artist . In Bob 's sketchbook , then , we found some faces from A Work In Pro  --  congress . We know what it is going to be in the end , because it is destined for the Post . But we wo n't tell you what that will be , because too many mutations will take place be  --  fore the final work is achieved , as Bob develops his theme . It will , at any rate , involve a cast of some young boys . And so Bob went to the Southwest Grammar School in Evergreen Park which he had at  --  tended himself , and spoke to a former teacher of his , in the fifth grade . Could he use a few of the boys as models , maybe ? Well , Bob is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps that helped a lit  --  tle . The boys were eager and a few were picked : two youngsters about nine or ten , John and Michael , and a bigger lad of perhaps twelve , Paul . The results are the unfinished sketches we show you here , as part of the continuing story of this fine young artist . Some day they may appear as a published book  --  a Rockwellian-like digest of the progress of a famous man . But today , they are just the birthmarks of fame , the stirrings of a talent which even this young artist does not suspect , so consumed is he by his calling and the joy of it . You should see him at work . There is nothing of the dramatic about Bob Howe at all . He is dedicated to what he does . But actually , he would do it just as devotedly if no one knew about it , as he has here . In the words of his generation , he is doing his thing , and he will continue to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised , and even grateful , when somebody likes his work . He is not being humble , particularly , and it certainly is not an assumed modesty . The fact of the matter is that Robert Charles Howe , phenomenally THE SATURDAY EVENING POST July ' August ' 73 well brought up and a polite young man besides , has a genuine desire to respond to whatever reaction you may have to his work , and to receive it with respect . On the other hand , he could n't care less what you think : because , God willing , he intends to go on doing this all of his life and the world may take it or leave it as it will . Pablo Picasso , whose colossal achievements in art rank with the greatest names in its history , was equally disdainful of art 's rewards . In fact he is reported to have found satisfaction in success only because it gave him the great sums of money to enable him to enjoy the pleasures of a poor man ... and the leisure to paint . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . The result you may see in these penciled sketches of the young schoolboys . These may never be published elsewhere , until Howe has achieved  --  if he does  --  the eminence of a Rock  --  well . Then purists will look into his veriest scribbles to see where the gems lie hidden . We found them simply by musing around his studio and stealing a look into his sketchbook , a heavy tome wherein he swiftly captures the impressions he will later translate onto canvas . We just print them here and ask : " Can you imagine a nineteen-year-old self-taught artist capturing these fleeting faces of childhood , thesefirm and yet pliant features , so solemn and yet so full of the joy simply of being alive ? Can you imagine him sitting there in that public school and catching these fleeting facial expressions and then banking them for all time in his sketch  --  book ? " He had no intention of ever showing them to anyone . But we persuaded him to let us publish them here , because Norman Rockwell also made sketches like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if he can . And perhaps we are lucky also to have found Bob Howe at the time when he was leaving home , because , before he did , he painted the house where he lives . It is an affectionate , in the sketch , just as Norman Rock  --  well does . Out front , that 's Bob , our mailman . He 's been our friend for eighteen years . Our neighbor at the right of the painting , Mr. Tom , really takes care of that iron railing on his porch . Right now he 's putting on a rustproof orange base  --  we all like to paint on our street . Over on the far right , that 's my grandma Martha , coming home from shopping . She 's seventy-eight but she sure gets around . " Grandfather 's gone , but he 's kind of in the picture anyway . He planted that blue spruce in front of our house when it was just a seedling . Grandma sees to it that we take care of it , all right . Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out front . " That bump in the car ? Oh , that 's the old Chevy I inherited from my grandfather . The lady across the street backed out of her garage one time and crumpled it up a little . " See the red cardinal in the tree ? I usually put a cardinal somewhere in my paintings if I can . When grandfather was alive he used to whistle a lot to a cardinal in our tree . I put , the bird in for him . " And so Bob Howe has painted his farewell to Evergreen Park and it will not be long before he will be chronicling the doings of his new home town , some miles north in Illinois . True , you ca n't go home again . Someday , Robert Charles Howe will stray back to Evergreen Park and walk slowly by the house he has pictured here . And know the truth  --  that time gives us only one chance at everything . Perhaps Bob may have known something about all this all along . Before he left his Evergreen Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upstairs window . There is no epochal view there of rolling hills and estates . But there is something even more to see , a great , clear view of the sky above . Only one human element is there  --  the rooftop of the house next door . And there , perched next to the sky , was a spar  --  row . So Bob swiftly sketched him , as you see here . Maybe you ca n't go home again . But if you can paint like Bob , you have the gift to take home along with you , to keep with you as long as you live and wherever you may go . You simply put brush to canvas  --  to bring into motion the impulses of eye , heart , and head  --  and in so doing make of unwilling Time a captive ever after . You can go home again , if your name is Robert Charles Howe , and yours is this God-given talent . n                 @ @ @ @
