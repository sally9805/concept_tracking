 | Spirits of Change Capture the Karens @# A N APRIL SUN burned in a cloudless Thailand sky as the family , relatives , and friends of Chaw Wah Hay marched up and down the hillsides . The men stabbed the earth with iron-tipped bamboo sticks while the women and children followed , dropping a few rice seeds in each hole . It was time for Chaw Wah Hay to speak to the spirits of hills and streams . Without their help there would be no rain , and no protection from the ants and termites , the boars and bears , the rats and ricebirds that would imperil the new crop . With dignity becoming a patriarch , he held his hands , palms together , before his face and spoke a solemn invocation : " Water Lord , Country Lord , Hill Lord , Mountain Lord , come down ! Lord of Laykawkey village , Lord of Laykawkey stream , send us down good rice , send us sparse weeds .... " The old man then sacrificed a chicken and daubed blood and a few feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit house ( left ) . After the chicken was cooked over a wood fire at the field 's edge , Chaw Wah Hay placed some of its meat , some rice , and a little drink of rice liquor in the small house . He lit a beeswax candle and invited the spirits to come and eat . Once they were served , the rest of us could have lunch . I shared the ceremonial meal and , when the work was done , walked back to Laykawkey , a Karen village of 34 bamboo houses perched on a hillside in the northwest corner of Thailand ( map , above ) . As an anthropologist from the University of Washington , I was studying the way of life of the Karen ( kahWREN ) people and the many social changes confronting them . My wife Sally and I planned to remain here for a year . Despite his piratical look , Chaw Wah Hay proved a friendly neighbor and generous source of information . His was a large family , whose daily problems reflected those of the whole Karen community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opium 267  | addiction , increasing poverty , and erosion of traditional values in a world whose change is beyond control . Yet we found our Karen neighbors bore their troubles in a cheery , resilient , and generally relaxed way . Northeast of Laykawkey , about a 90-minute walk away , lay the village of Pa Pae , where we had lived , off and on , for more than two years while studying another group of hill people , the Lua. * Sally and I knew that a handful of Karens had moved into these hills about 125 years ago and now far outnumbered the native Lua . While living in the same area and using the same agricultural methods , these neighbors continued to differ markedly in speech and dress , as well as in spiritual and social outlook . We decided to explore these differences and to learn how the Karens came to predominate in the land of the Lua . " Why do you want to live in a Karen village ? " our Lua friends asked . " You 'll find it dirty and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? those people never bathe ! Besides , you do n't know the language , and we will miss you when you go ? Later , when we were settled in Laykawkey , it amused us to hear our new neighbors castigate the Lua as unclean and much too serious Mats Roof " Bird With Two Heads " We were lucky to have Benny Gyaw with us when we moved . Ben was a refugee from Burma , where more than a million Karen ' dwell in the eastern hills and feel the impact of the long political struggle in that country In Thailand , he joined more than 100,000 other Karens the most numerous minority group except for the Chinese and Malays @#  | Although often labeled as a " hill tribe , " Thailand 's Karens occupy both upland and lowland villages . In Laykawkey our friends called the bamboo house on stilts they built for us a " bird with two heads , " because it was double ; Benny Gyaw had his own room and porch back to back with ours . Ladders led up to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but fortunately it was the dry season . At night we found it pleasant to look at the moon and stars through cracks in the temporary roofing of threshing mats . Karen homes have square fireplaces recessed into the floor , where wood burns on a bed of clay . But Sally cooked in comparative luxury ? on a propane stove . The 50-pound tanks of gas ( one lasted for a couple of months ) came on porters ' backs 18 miles uphill from the market town of Mae Sariang.  | Without a fireplace , we had more sitting space for guests . The villagers quickly learned they were welcome , and any evening a dozen or more might show up . We offered them tea , and tobacco for their pipes ; we had a waiting list for empty cans . The Karens grow tobacco ( page 268 ) , but prefer the store-bought kind . In turn we called on our new neighbors , starting our work with a census . This gave the villagers a chance to size up the strangers in their midst and allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best tolerate all our silly questions and the inevitable misunderstandings with a foreigner ? Who could shrug off inadvertently embarrassing queries ? Our house looked out on the porch of Naw Serdah ( her name , a common one , means " youngest daughter " ) . She lived with her widowed mother , Naw Kah Ay ( " bitter , feces , " a name deliberately chosen to be so repulsive that bad spirits would leave her alone ) . Naw Serdah at 18 was single and eligible , so she always had a lot of friends around . Downhill from us lived Pah Dee Hay with his pregnant wife and six children . His adolescent son Pah Ay Wah was never around to help his parents , whom we had hired to haul water from a small spring under the mango trees below the village . The house of Chaw Wah Hay and the eight in his family stood at the top of the hill . His youngest son , recently married to a girl from a distant village , kept coming home at least once a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at his father-inlaw 's house , according to Karen custom , to help in his fields . Sometimes his wife came to haul him away . It was Chaw Wah Hay who made us aware of the power of the myriad spirits that populate the Karens ' animistic world . " When I moved here 40 years ago , people died easily , the spirits were very strong , and the place was violent . One day two brothers went digging for a meal of beetles on the hill east of the village , " he related . " We found one brother dead , between two branches of a tree , and the other in the hollow of a tree , his @# eyes dug out . This was the work of spirits . " Death is very close to us in these hills , " Chaw Wah Hay continued . " A snake or tiger may bite you , or you might fall off a cliff or drown in a stream . If men do not behave , disaster always follows ? disease , death of chickens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We hill Karens have no medicine or doctors like the Thais and the foreigners , so we must rely on the spirits . When something goes wrong , we divine with the aid of chicken bones . If the divination says that the spirits must be fed a pig , we sacrifice a pig ? a chicken wo n't do . When you do sacrifice a pig ; though , the patient gets well pretty fast . " Karens believe that the spirits cause pain  | or illness in order to let people know they are feeling neglected or offended ( page 280 ) . One day during harvest I went to the fields with Chaw Wah Hay , and he was stung by a wasp . " I think , " he said , " the spirits are angry at me for telling you so much about them . " But he recovered so rapidly that he concluded it must have been just an ordinary wasp sting and not a message from a resentful spirit . Early Marriages Boost Population As Sally and I began to assemble our census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the median age was only 16 . To make sure their daughters get suitable husbands , parents often arrange early marriages , which result in large families . Married women , on the average , have seven children . Even though almost 40 percent of the infants die before maturity , the population more than doubles in a generation . By contrast , Lua grooms , who must have a sizable bride-price , marry when they are older . As a result , the Lua population increases more slowly than that of the Karens . Rapid population growth has led to strife . Laykawkey , for example , was founded only about four generations ago but is already running out of land . Said Poo Loo Kay , an elder with many children and grandchildren : " They help me clear a large field , and I will be well fed in my old age . "  | Another friend , Ah Poo , found fault with their attitude . " Poo Loo Kay and his sons and sons-in-law just take what they want , " he complained . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson off a field her husband used to cultivate . It 's hard to get back a field unless you are strong or have lots of relatives to stick up for you . " In the old days , when we quarreled like this , we could always go off and form a new village , " he added . " But now there is no space for a new village . " Renting Land Is a Risky Business When we could take time from our Laykawkey routine , Sally , Benny Gyaw , and I walked to the lands bordering on Lua holdings and found the Karens gradually pushing into their neighbors ' fields . Our old friends in Pa Pae have learned from bitter experience that land once rented to a Karen is lost forever . Piece by piece the Laykawkey folk are gaining land from the Lua of Pa Pae . On one of our walks we visited the valley village of Paykoh , nine miles to the southwest . Its headman told me that the Karens once were masters and rulers of all races . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said with good humor . " The taxes we imposed were so heavy that when the people were bringing them in , the pack straps of their carrying baskets sang like guitar strings . We were such oppressive rulers that the people got disgusted and chased us out . Now we pay taxes to the Thais , just like everyone else . " Back home in Laykawkey , we were caught up in the easygoing village life . Tranquillity lay on the hillsides like a spell . Old women on porches would look up from their weaving to talk with us . Amid the house pilings pigs snuffled and roosters scratched and crowed . Metronome for the passing hours was the " thunk-thunk " of wooden mortars as women pounded rice , husking it for the evening meal . Yet we knew that under the placid appearance of things , a crisis of authority seethed . The young wife of an old man was carrying on with her sister 's husband . The spirits of the earth were offended . People feared for the reputation of their village and worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic or crop failure . To cool the temper of the spirits , a buffalo had to be sacrificed and its blood allowed to run into the ground . But the villagers could not decide who should pay for the animal and , by becoming involved , expose himself to the anger of the spirits . Pah Chay Too , one of the village leaders . finally agreed to take the risk . But the oldest woman in the village , still vigorous and proud . carped to me : " That Pah Chay Too is not a proper leader . He 's an upstart . His father was n't anything ? he did n't have the right ancestors . If he were a real leader , the spirits would favor him with good fortune and bountiful harvests , but he is just as poor as anyone in this village . Now that my father is dead . my son should be the one . " But neither the old lady nor her son dared to summon the earth spirits , so the job was done by Pah Chay Too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through endless discussions by the village elders . Harmony was not restored until the old husband found another hamlet that would accept him and his straying wife . Spirits Can Demand Too Much The difficulty of coping with the omnipresent spirits has caused some Karens to accept other faiths . The Karens associate various religions with ethnic groups ? Buddhism with the Burmese and the Thais , Islam with the Pakistani merchants , and Christianity with Westerners . They share spirit feeding with the Lua and other hill people . Feeding the ancestral spirits , which cause illness when hungry or neglected , is essential to good health . To escape this onerous obligation , many in the Mae Sariang hills have adopted a complex ritual , first learned in Burma , that supposedly confuses the spirits and gets rid of their demands . Other Karens have become Christian , while many in the valley practice Buddhism . A few at Laykawkey consider themselves Buddhists as well as feeders of spirits . A village woman told me  | she still fed the spirits of her parents for her health , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will prosper . " In general , Laykawkey is not prospering , however . Crop yields decline as pressure on the land increases . The villagers have less to sell , while they are increasingly dazzled by the goods they see in the Mae Sariang market . Hiring out elephants to lowland lumber firms is a major source of cash income , but only the richest Laykawkey families own elephants or even share in the ownership of one ( pages 279 and 282-3 ) . Some Karen men have worked at the tin mines , but landslides killed several , and many now regard that labor as too dangerous . The village 's economic problems are aggravated by a growing social illness . Our neighbor Pah Dee Hay was an opium addict . And so were his younger brother and several other men in the village . Opium-poppy cultivation and opium smoking are illegal in Thailand , and everyone knows it . Yet we learned that more than 15 percent of the older men in our village were opium smokers , and we saw younger men beginning to experiment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers of the Meo tribe moved into the hills near Laykawkey about ten years ago . Addicts work for lower wages , and the Meos encourage Lua and Karen workers in their fields to take at least part of their wages in opium rather than in cash . Scary Prediction Reforms an Addict Pah Dee Hay invited me to photograph him smoking opium in his empty rice barr . ( page 275 ) . He was always pleasant and agreeable and quite willing to discuss his habit . But despite the pleas of his family and our urgings , he sank deeper and deeper into debt and sold or mortgaged everything he could get his hands on to support his addiction . His children were in rags , and his barn was empty long before the next harvest was due . About eight months after we came to Laykawkey , Pah Dee Hay stopped smoking , at least temporarily , after consulting a Buddhist priest in Mae Sariang. @#  | " He gave me holy water and frightened me , " Pah Dee Hay told me . " He said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be eaten by a tiger . I would die horribly . " Pah Dee Hay managed to recover his strength in time to work on his harvest . For him , as for all others in Laykawkey , life moves in rhythm with the rice crop . From planting in April , through the tedious weeding of the rainy season , to the harvest of October or November , rice culture sets the pace of the people 's days . The villagers plant rice in irrigated fields wherever they can build level terraces and water them from creeks . But most of the harvest is dry rice , grown on hillsides by slashand-burn agriculture . The Karens farm each field for one year , then let it lie fallow . New trees sprout and send down roots to bring essential chemicals up again in leaves , stems , and branches . When these are burned , their ashes fertilize the new crops in the sunlight of the fire-cleared slopes . In past generations there has been enough land to support permanent villages within walking distance of the fields . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true much longer . The pressure to grow more rice to feed more people now has reduced the fallow interval in some villages like Laykawkey to only six or seven years ? too short a time for fertility to be fully restored . The older farmers of Laykawkey already notice the declining yields . In late January I climbed with the village men to a forest area chosen for the next season 's rice field . Everyone strong enough to wield a two-foot knife helped fell the trees and clear the brush , leaving them to bake dry in the sun . Cutting the trees in the dry season conserves soil moisture . When the felled trees are burned in March , the dampness keeps the ground cool and later nurtures the rice seedlings before the rains arrive . Excitement and danger attend the burning of the slash . On the appointed day we watched the young men prepare their torches of split bamboo . The early sun burned the dew off the tinder-dry vegetation , and the men set fire to it . We stood at the highest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they burned ? and to make sure our own house was n't consumed in the process ! The men lit the first fires at the tops of the fields , helping create an updraft to assure a quick , complete burn . Firebreaks that had been cleared previously kept the flames from spreading over the ridgetops . With the upper parts of the fields lighted , the men raced clown to touch off the brush at the bottoms of the fields , running as fast as they could to outpace the flames . A few people stayed home to guard the village houses . Ah Poo climbed to the ridgepole of his house carrying water-filled bamboo tubes . Taking big mouthfuls of the water , he sprayed the thatch to keep it damp and cool . Children joined the fun , squirting the roofs with water guns made of bamboo cylinders . Even the old ladies stood between their houses and the flames . They tossed salt in their winnowing trays as magic to make the wind blow away from the village . The fire was awesome to watch . Tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The inferno roared , and exploding bamboo stems sounded like cannon fire . In about an hour more than a hundred acres were reduced to bare hillsides strewn with smoldering logs ( pages 272-3 ) . Ritual Duties Greeted With Boredom To the Karens , the ritual of agriculture is as important as farming methods . With only the simplest tools , and with an unpredictable water supply , they feel at the mercy of spirits . Each Karen field in this area has both a legal and a ritual owner . The latter is responsible for all necessary ceremonies throughout the growing year . Often a young child is selected as ritual owner , because the Karens think that children have not lived long enough to offend the spirits . By this participation the children learn the rituals and prayers . Pah Dee Hay chose his son as ritual field owner during our year in the village . Far from feeling honored , Pah Ay Wah was utterly bored . His father had to keep chasing after him whenever a chicken had to be sacrificed or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the first weeding , Sally and I walked over the ridge and across a valley to Pah Dee Hay 's field to see a chicken sacrificed and hear a prayer at the feeding of the rice spirits : " Rice , 0 ! Come back good again . Return white again . Come back thick and swaying 284 National Geograp  | dark . Come back green and spreading . Return and fill last year 's field . Return and fill this year 's field . Come back with your stalks thick as wild bananas . Come back with grains as big as melons . Be restored , you who have been eaten by tiny red ants . Come back and eat chicken blood , 0 Rice Lord ! " Wild boars and bears sneak out of the forest to raid the ripening fields by night . No fence is strong enough to keep them and the village elephants out . The men make all sorts of wind- and water-powered gongs and clackers to scare them away , but the animals soon become accustomed to the pleasant clunking sounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a joyful time of hard work . In October , when the rice had ripened , we watched the villagers cut it with sickles and carefully lay it on top of the stubble to dry . To ensure that the supply lasts from one harvest to the next , the field owner must summon the straying soul of the rice . On the day of threshing , I followed Chaw Wah Hay around his field as he called softly : " Proo ! Rice soul ! Return to the top of the rice fields . Come back inside the rice fields ... . If you have gone where the sun sets , if you have gone where the sun rises , come back from near and far . Return to fill the fields and granaries . " Always there is hope that the rice soul will not allow the grain to diminish . Always there is fear that rice will vanish or be stolen . Each evening the owner marks his rice with twisted straw or woven bamboo signs to notify the spirits that this rice belongs to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer afford the sacrifices required by their animistic traditions . More and more , they seek to share in the benefits of modern life . Education is one path to greater income for the hill people , but Laykawkey has no school , and few parents feel they can do without the help of their children in the fields . Most educated Karens have gone to school through the assistance of missionaries , or because they @# lived in one of the villages that have government schools ( page 281 ) . But the overriding problem is finding enough to eat . Rice yields are declining and debts are growing . The usual interest rate on borrowed rice is between 50 and 100 percent . But the Karens of Laykawkey and their neighbors , the Lua of Pa Pae , have received a grant from the King of Thailand to allow them to build and stock local rice banks . Prince Bhisadej Rachanee , the King 's assistant for hill-tribe development , flew up by helicopter to lend the authority of his presence at the program 's inauguration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to set the annual interest rate ( only 30 percent ) , and to administer the loans of rice The village committee used the King 's money to buy rice , which they lent to their neediest neighbors . The bank was successful in its first year . Almost all the loans were repaid with interest , and there was more rice in the bank than when it started . New Techniques Bring Hope for Future New varieties of rice , brought to Laykawkey and Pa Pae by Dr. Sanga Sabhasri of Kasetsart University , may improve crop yields . Certainly innovations in farming practices will help the food situation . Though nonagricultural sources of income ? elephant contracting and mining ? help support a few Karen families , the rice harvest remains the basis of Karen life . Our own harvest was in as well ? a year 's notes and photographs of land and people . Regretfully , we walked along the ridge for the last time and heard for the last time Laykawkey 's elephant bells in the early morning . We wonder what will happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are only beginning to recognize the changes . There is no more empty land , but there are ever-increasing demands on meager incomes . We can only hope that , with the new source of credit and with new varieties of rice , the villagers will be able to buy enough time to learn to cope with the quickly changing conditions of the modern world . fl
