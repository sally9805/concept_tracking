NOEL COWARD IN TWO KEYS <P> by NOEL COWARD <P> Nol Coward 's iridescent wit sometimes did not quite conceal a quality in him that was sentimental and even heartbroken . Nothing vulgar or mawkish , of course-just a sense of life 's complicated unforgiveness . These two short plays , which were among his last works and probably not his best , still glisten with the famous Coward talent to amuse . But the evening ends with a certain suppressed sadness . <P> The two are part of a set of three short plays in which Coward starred in London in 1966 . The curtain-raiser , Come into the Garden , Maud , is a fast five-finger exercise about a middle-aged American millionaire in Europe and his vile , blue-haired wife , whose hobby is collecting titled Europeans . With a witty tenderness , Coward has the amiable golfing millionaire , clad in Hush Puppies and a loud sport jacket , fall in love with a minor Italian princess and abandon his harpy wife . The talk is frequently funny : the husband dismisses one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat an apple through a tennis racket . But often Coward 's celebrated champagne wit amounts to no more than , say , Asti Spumante-or even a frothy ginger ale . <P> The second play has an uncharacteristic darkness . Sir Hugo Latymer is a famous old British writer with a talent for elegant malice . A Song at Twilight may have been as close as Coward came to autobiography-although Latymer bears a resemblance to Somerset Maugham . While Latymer and his German wife-secretary are at a Swiss hotel , an actress whom he loved in his youth and denigrated in his memoirs appears for a sudden reunion . They share caviar and steak . Eventually , the former mistress reveals that she possesses the letters Hugo once wrote to a homosexual lover he had always concealed . The actress accuses Hugo of the sins that Coward may have charged himself with : hypocrisy and a loveless , satirical eye . <P> What gives the evening a high polish is the cast . Anne Baxter plays the Italian princess and the former mistress with a likable and knowing broadness . Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Burns , but his Hugo is a masterpiece of foxy pomposity . Best of all is Jessica Tandy , first as the harridan in Maud and then as the great man 's dry , abused wife . She endows the woman with an odd gallantry that Coward himself may have possessed . <P> Lance Morrow
