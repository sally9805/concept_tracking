txt Patricia Hearst was depicted by her attorney Wednesday as a terrified and sexually abused . prisoner who was brainwashed , and threatened with death by a group of " crackpot revolutionaries . " Chief defense counsel F. Lee Bailey , in an opening statement to the jury in Miss Hearst 's bank robbery trial , argued that the defendant went along on the holdup because her terrorist captors told her that " if she messed up she would be blown to bits . " Bailey 's explanation for the bizarre conduct of the kidnaped newspaper heiress was in sharp contrast to the view offered by prosecutor JameS BroWning in his opening argument in Federal District Court . .. . READING FROM a manuscript seized in an apartment occupied by SymbioPatricia Hearst jury of seven women and ' five ' men is made up mostly of middle class white collar workers and housewives . Page 11. - nese Liberation Army members William and Emily Harris , Browning quoted a ' portion of . it which he said is in Miss Hearst 's own hand . The document explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch in San Francisco 's Sunset District on April 15 , 1979 , including the shooting and wounding of two customers . " We did n't really expect any trouble ' from the customers ; in fact , we thoUght that the bank employes would give more trouble than the customers ; but we were wrong ' , " ** quoted Miss Hearst as writing : " We did n't go into the " bank with ? the intention of shooting someone . . . . We expected people to cooperate with us and not freak out . " Browning cited the manuscript ? as well as the 21-year-old. defendant 's , conducf , during the 20 months . between , the robbery and her capture last September ? in support of his contention that she was a willing participant in the robbery . THE PROSECUTOR quoted from another portion of the document in which the SU : explained . that they robbed the bank because " we needed the money and we ' *anted to illustrate that Tania was alive - and her decision was n't a bunch of B.S. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape sent to a local radio station two weeks before the robbery , in which she renounced her parents and announced that she was joining her SLA captors . The manuscript also quotes the terrorist group as saying , " We intended to propagandize Tania joining the cell and we intended this to be a well-planned , but flamboyant robbery. ? Browning did not make it clear whom he considers the author of the document , except to say that there are portions which are in Miss Hearst 's handwriting . Facing the jury of seven women and five men who had been impanelled only two hours before , Browning began his statement by conceding that the defendant was kidnaped by the SLA on the night of Feb. 4 , 1974 . IIE TIIEN SPENT more than an hour tracing Miss Hearst 's steps from that even in g ? exactly two years ago  --  through a trip to Los Angeles and eventually to her arres , by San Francisco police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Earlier M the day Browning won a major point as Judge Oliver Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possible criminal conduct by Miss Hearst after the robbery . The judge did leave open the possibility that he will bar such evidence at the time of its introduction , but his willingness to allow Browning to cover that period in his statement brought cries of protest from Bailey , who argued that the damage would then already be done . " You mean you ca n't wiring- a bell ? " Carter asked humorously . " Yes , and you can t remove the odor once the skunk has been in the courtroom , " Bailey replied . CARTER 'S RULING cleared the way for Browning to describe an incident in front of a Los Angeles sporting goods store in May , 1974 , during which Miss Hearst allegedly sprayed the area with bullets from an automatic weapon to help William Harris , who was being detained in the store on suspicion of shoplifting . Browning said he plans to call as a witness Tom Matthews , 19 , a student who said he was kidnaped by Miss Hearst and the Harrises after the episode at the sporting goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the defendant was not a prisoner of the Harrises and that she told him personally that she had been a " voluntary participant " in the bank robbery . in another development , . Browning said an automatic weapon ? recovered from the San Francisco apartment where Miss Hearst was arrested on Sept. 18 , 1975 , is apparently the same one she held in her hand while photographed by bank cameras during the robbery . Browning also promised to produce witnesses to testify that they heard Miss Hearst say during the robbery : " The first person that moves gets his ? head shot off . " BAILEY , VISIBLY shaken by the judge 's ruling allowing discussion of his client 's post-robbery conduct , rose to his feet after Browning had completed his statement and asked for a mistrial , arguing that the jury was now so " tainted " it could no longer hear the case . Carter denied the motion . Bailey then began a passionate 20-minute speech in behalf of the frail former student of art history ' . who , he said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SLA . He said the SLA had two motives for the kidnaping : First , they wanted to use Miss Hearst for some " bargaining pewee ' in trying to obtain the freedom of Russell Little and Joseph Rewire , two SLA members charged with the murder of Oakland Schools Supt. Marcui Foster . " And second , " he continued , his voice rising , " these crazy people actually thought  --  and I think from the evidence you will be convinced  --  that they were decidedly serious that they could overthrow the United States of America through terrorist tactics and support they would pick up along the way . " BAILEY SPECIFICALY referred to the SLA 's demand , made public shortly after the kidnaping , that Miss Hearst 's father spend millions of dollars on a free food distribution program for the poor . Asserting that this was merely a ploy by the SLA to gain support among the " have-nots , " Bailey said : " Every crackpot revoluti  --  nary in the history of man has started out by trying to gain the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Attempting . to explain Miss Hearst 's taped denunciations of her parents , . Bailey said he will offer testimony showing that Donald " Cinque " DeFreeze , the SLA field marshal who masterminded the kidnaping , had read a number of books on " mind control " while serving a sentence in San Quentin Pris'on . Referring to instances of brainwashing on GIs during the " Korean War and promising expert testimony on the subject , he said , " People could be made to make voluntary , enthusiakic statements that amounted to treason. - Bailey said DeFreeze managed to persuade his , prisoner over a period of time , " that she had been abandoned by society , her parents , and all of law enforcement . They had become her enemy , and ultimately they would kill her if she exposed herself or tried to turn herself in . " DESCRIBING HER confinement in a dark and cramped closet for at least six weeks , the attorney argued that the SLA fed her a steady diet of lies and threats . " She was sexually abused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of survival was to attempt to avoid offending those who had her in their custody , " he said . Claiming that the gun she held during the robbery was " inoperable , " Bailey said the four , SLA members present told her that ' " if she messed up in any way they would , without hesitation , blow her to bits . " Those four participants  --  DeFreeze , Nancy Ling Perry , Patricia Soltysik , and Camilla Hall  --  all died in a shootout with Los Angeles police a month later . Bailey , describing the fiery incident and the heavy gunfire employed by the police in it , suggested that the Harrises  --  the last remnants of the SLA  --  used that episode to persuade Miss Hearst further that the authorities wanted to kill her . Bailey also charged for the first time that . William Harris was one of those involved in the initial kidnaping , and that he forced Miss Hearst to make the tape in which she claimed she freely partook in the bank robbery .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
