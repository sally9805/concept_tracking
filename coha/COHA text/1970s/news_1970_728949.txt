txt The Opposition leader in the Australian Parliament , Gough Whitlam , has blown up a parliamentary storm with the disclosure that he has advised national servicemen with a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war to refuse to obey any order to go to Vietnam . While the newspapers are playing up the shouting match that has developed between Prime Minister John Gorton and Mr. Whit-lam over the episode , the impact the affair is making on the electorate appears marginal . Everybody concedes that . Mr. Whitlam has committed a gaffe , but the general feeling is that by the time the next election comes around in 1972 Vietnam will be just an unhappy memory . Furthermore , the whole affair has been muddied by the questionable behavior of the Prime Minister himself in ordering a government department , the News and Information Bureau , to photograph Mr. Whitlam at a moratorium demonstration and ? then using the pictures to charge that Mr. Whitlam spoke under a Viet Cong flag . Mr. Whitlam has answered with some justification that the pictures were doctored and that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually the only doctoring done had been some conventional trimming of the edges of the photograph . Foreshortening involved The real objection by Mr. Whitlam had been the foreshortening caused by the use of a telephoto lens and the fact that this was not indicated when the photograph was presented in Parliament , Most significant about the whole episode is the way in which the government is desperately seeking ways to discredit Mr. Whitlam , the Labor Party leader , who is building a reputation as the nation 's most formidable politician . // *Personal row in Australia // Despite the fact that it was returned to power less than 12 months ago for a three-year term of Parliament , the Liberal-Country Party government is rattled . True , there is a Senate election later this year , but the outcome is predictable because of the voting system applied . There will be no winners and no losers from that election . The upper house will continue to be controlled by a corner group of independents and the minuscule Democratic Labor Party . Economic outlook sound The anxiety in the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic outlook is examined . No government ever had an economy running in Australia with the same promise the present one has . There are real pockets of trouble on the rural front , but the booming mineral-export market has removed any fear of a balance-of-payments crisis and at the same time provided a breathing space for long-overdue rural reconstruction . The present uneasiness within the government is almost entirely a matter of personality politics . If anything the current lack of economic problems focuses more attention than normally would be the case on the differing personalities of Mr. Gorton and Mr. Whit-lam . As one prominent Australian academic , Dr. S. Encel , wrote shortly after the election of Mr. Gorton , Australia 's prime ministers historically could be divided into two camps  --  the larrakins and the statesmen . The American equivalent for " larrakin " is roughly " maverick . " Mr. Gorton , he asserted , is of the larrakin variety . Mr. Whitlam , on the other hand , is in the statesman mold , he wrote . At the time Dr. Encel 's article was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of time his generalities have taken on an impressive prescience . Confidence tested A series of embarrassing scrapes uui mg , the early days of Mr. Gorton 's leadership undermined several government members ' confidence in their new leader ; but when an attempt was made to tip him out of office just before the last election the man behind the move was thrown out of the party . The Prime Minister withstood another challenge to his leadership just after the election and then , somewhat chastened by the experience , changed his life-style to one of greater commitment to desk work rather than hopping around the country from one reception to another , as he had been doing . Most of his speaking engagements were restricted to meetings of the party faithful . His television appearances were kept to the barest minimum and even his parliamentary speeches were cut back . He did not even bother to speak during the annual budget debate . He abandoned completely the habit of holding background press briefings and instead held two televised press conferences With the Canberra press gallery .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
