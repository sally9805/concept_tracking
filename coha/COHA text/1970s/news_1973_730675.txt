txt " What about the other men returning from Vietnam ? what about the killed , the wounded , the missing . . . and those who just served honorably ? " This somber , sometimes outer quesuon is being heard in the Pentagon and across the United States , adding a sad note to the rejoicing and thanks that are greeting America 's returning POWs . A groundswell of gifts and hoopla threaten to engulf the returning POWs , despite concerted efforts at the Pentagon to keep their homecoming low key . One hundred thirty-five military and eight civilians held captive in North Vietnamese and Viet Cong prison camps returned home during the past week amid scenes of emotional patriotism throughout the U.S. In addition to the former prisoners who came home during the past week , another 20 , the so-called Kissinger 20 , whose release Dr. Henry A. Kissinger , the President 's envoy , arranged while he was in Hanoi , had arrived at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines on Sunday . That left an estimated 399 American prisoners still to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1,328 listed as missing turn up alive in remote jungle camps in South Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia . The Department of Defense worked hard in the interests of the returning POWs to restrain the emotional and commercial exploitation of their homecoming . But it was an ungrateful task because these men came home to an America starving for Vietnam heroes , hungry for words of praise and glory , and the former prisoners met this need . One of those who voiced concern that the semi-commercial exploitation of the returnees was not only bad for the men but would stir resentment among the families of those still missing in action was Col. Edward J Huycke , director of professional services for the assistant secretary of defense for health and environment . He reflected the tide of questions being asked across the country : // *What about the others serving in Vietnam ? // What about gifts for the families of those missing in action ? What about the families of the 46,000 dead and the 153,000 wounded , many of them disabled for life ? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And what about all the others who served but were not captured ? Answer told little The only available answer was that the military rotation system has enveloped the return of all the others as they came home piece-meal in gray anonymity and public indifference . A so-called Joint Casualty Resolution Center will be established at the existing military base at Nakhon Phanom in eastern Thailand . The new group which will have as many as 1,000 personnel , will operate into Laos as soon as a cease-fire has been concluded to search out the graves of American airmen shot down during the fighting and to seek information about any Americans that may still be prisoners in remote areas . In the weeks when the first prisoners returned , the Veterans Administration announced a cut in disability benefits for Vietnam veterans The cut was rescinded by President Nixon after a public outcry . In the same week the unemployment rate among Vietnam veterans aged 20 to 24 was 8.6 for whites and 9.5 for blacks , compared with 7.4 for others of that age . But for the POWs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lt. Col. Everett Alvarez of Oklahoma City , who had been imprisoned longer than any of the other POWs ? eight and a half years ? spoke for them all when he got to Clark : " We are finally going home to the greatest country in the whole world , " he said . Welcome amazing The men were amazed at the welcome they got . Amid the sr lutes and the waving , many wept with joy as wives and mothers and children flew into their arms . There was one seven-year-old who stood ramrod straight , however , and shook hands with the father whom he had never seen before . In the interests of protecting the men 's privacy , the Department of Defense throughout the first week managed to prevent the U.S. press from having any but the skimpiest interviews , but this did not dampen their hero 's welcomes at Clark , Travis , and in and around 27 hospitals to which they were distributed Flags which had been at half mast in honor of former President Johnson were raised to full mast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got an orchid corsage from Mrs. Nixon . Red carpets were rolled out , crowds were on hand in icy rain and in the small hours of the morning . All kinds of help offered The government and 16 major companies announced they would do anything to find jobs for these men if they wished to quit the service . The Ford Motor Company announced that It would lend a car for a year to each of the former prisoners . AP photo Hotel chains offered them free accomodations and airlines free transportation . A brewer promised them free beer for a year . Free vacations awaited them in the Virgin Islands and Hawaii . A company called Welcome Home Our Prisoners , Inc. , wanted to raise $1 million to $2 million to provide every returnee with a two-week vacation , a car , and a color TV . Generally the first men home from North Vietnam were in good shape ? far better than those who returned from North Korean camps almost two decades ago . Those from jungle camps in the south were in poorer condition . Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , were still to be expected . but not until all the prisoners are out and there is no more chance of reprisals . Also to be expected are charges by some men that others served the enemy with broadcasts or by informing on their fellows . But the Pentagon served notice that the U.S. government did not intend to bring such charges .
