txt As the American presidential campaign begins in earnest , the Democratic candidate seems far behind . Sen. George McGovern 's one abiding hope today : that the President may turn out to be another Thomas E. Dewey . In 1948 Mr. Dewey , far out in front in the polls and in the press was the absolute , certain , beyond-a-doubt winner over Harry S. Truman . But the experts were wrong , and Mr. Truman won . Overconfidence alone did not sink Mr. Dewey that year ( although it was involved ) ; more than anything , it was a hard-slashing , spunky , vigorous , whistle-stopping campaign by Mr. Truman that upset both Mr. Dewey and those who had foretold Mr. Truman 's doom . Now , taking his cue from Mr. Truman , it is the strategy of Senator McGovern to hit and hit and hit again at Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew and the Republicans . Sympathy and support won Mr. Truman was the underdog , and he used this appearance of being the certain loser to good advantage . At some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1948 ? Mr. Truman began to win the sympathy and support of the crowds he was talking to . // prohibited without permission . *McGovern to ' do a Truman ' ? // Then his audiences began to cheer him on ? this plucky little fellow who was fighting against all those odds and all those wealthy people and special interests ( or so Mr. Truman charged ) that were behind Mr. Dewey . Mr. McGovern is also the distinct underdog . In fact , if there is virtue in being behind , it can be said that Mr. McGovern is even more to the rear than was Mr. Truman at any point in that campaign of yesteryear . Nixon as target Harry Truman 's target was a " do-nothing Congress " as he called that Republican-dominated body . George McGovern 's target is Richard Nixon . On every platform across the land the Democratic standard-bearer will , seek to portray Mr. Nixon as a man who , essentially , does not care for others ? as a man who is flawed by a lack of compassion , particularly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against because of race , color , or religion . He will seek to convince the voters that Mr. Nixon has proved himself a cruel and inhumanitarian perpetrator of senseless botnbing and killing in Vietnam . At the same time he will try to make the point that Mr. Nixon , his denials to the contrary , is continuing a war that could be ended in a few days or weeks if the President would put his mind to it . Polarization charge expected And , on the domestic issues , the Democratic candidate will charge that the President really does n't have his heart in helping the poor and oppressed and in forging a nation that is truly united . He will say that the President actually encourages the polarization of the races , blacks against whites . He will also say that Mr. Nixon will never solve the crime problem ? particularly that which relates to the blacks ? because he does not deal with the root causes : the joblessness , the poverty , and the educational and training needs of this minority group . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President to the place where Mr. Nixon will feel he has to defend himself publicly , and that Mr. McGovern feels that if he can draw the President into a dialogue of this kind , he will be able to take the measure of the nation 's chief executive in such man-to-man combat . Strategy discussed But there is another strategy that aides in the McGovern camp are discussing these days : It is to let the President think Senator McGovern really wants him in the ring with him ? thus reinforcing the Nixon resolve not to comply and to stay aloof from the battle . And it is then for Mr. McGovern to continue , each day , to slash and attack ? thus gaining the image , in time , of being the only candidate who is on the offensive , the only candidate who actually is campaigning , and the only candidate who really wants the job so much he will work tirelessly to get it . It is , beyond a doubt , a Harry Truman approach to snatching victory out of the jaws of defeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey ? Only time will tell .
