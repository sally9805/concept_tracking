The visitors from America had come to pay a courtesy call on Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his stylish wife Imelda . Dutifully diplomatic , they praised Autocrat Marcos for his leadership and vision . The President was flattered , and one of the guests continued to gush . " Looking at the way you chose your wife , I can see you 're not so dumb , " said Muhammad Ali . Joe Frazier flinched , but Marcos quickly counterpunched . " Looking at yours , " he informed the heavyweight champ , " I can see you 're not so far behind . " <P> If Ali 's reception in Manila was any indication , he may in fact be far ahead . Fully 5,000 Filipinos jammed the airport just after dawn one day last week to welcome him . As the door of the 707 opened , a solitary tenor launched into the opening verse of a ballad commissioned for the occasion . The warrior emerged from the jet , paused , then strutted down the steps to the strains of The Muhammad Ali March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title against Frazier in an extravaganza he touts as the " Thrilla in Manila . " In fact , the expedition resembles nothing so much as a royal tour . Ali has become one of the most readily recognized individuals in the world . Since he inaugurated his gaudy Third World road show with a knockout of George Foreman a year ago in Zare , he has parleyed with Presidents and sheiks .

Within hours of his arrival he waltzed through a workout and presided over a press conference . " What is Frazier mad at me for ? " he asked . " I have made him the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors like a thief in the night-alone and almost totally ignored . His arrival ceremony in the Philippines barely lasted a minute . He sticks close to his suite where he peels grapefruit and plays high-stakes blackjack with his sparring partners to pass the time . On his first morning of roadwork , he found the Manila streets clogged with joggers ; he was later granted special government permission to start before the national curfew is lifted at 4 a.m . In the afternoon , he retreats to his dressing room , which is decorated in the same red and blue motif that jazzes up his gym in Philadelphia . <P> Good Target . When Ali flew in , Frazier sent his 15-year-old son Marvis to heckle the champ by singing the latest Frazier recording , First-Round Knockout . Ali could n't resist the chance to spar . Summoning Marvis to the microphone , he said , " He 's better looking than his father , and he makes more sense . " Marvis bravely sang on . " Hey , that 's good " said Ali .
