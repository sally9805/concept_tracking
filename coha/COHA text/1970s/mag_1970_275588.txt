All summer borrowers have been waiting for evidence that a drop in interest rates would turn out to be the real thing rather than a temporary flutter . Last week they got a strong sign as the bond market passed a critical test . On a single day , New England Telephone and Telegraph and International Harvester simultaneously floated issues totaling $275 million , a financing load that in almost any week earlier this summer would have depressed bond prices and sent interest rates soaring again . Somewhat to the surprise of underwriters , nearly all of the bonds were sold promptly , and interest rates stayed down . <P> New England Telephone 's $175 million of bonds will yield 8.65% , a sky-high rate by historic standards but well below the record 9.35% rate on a New Jersey Bell offering in mid-June . Some other interest rates have shown even greater declines over the same period ; the average yield on tax-exempt bonds issued by states and cities , for example , has fallen to 6.16% from a record 7.12% . The " federal funds " rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6.75% from 9.75% early this year . Even home-mortgage rates have backed off a bit from their highs , easing to an average 8.97% from 9.3% at the end of June . The drops have brought home buyers and state and city treasurers their first welcome financial news in many months . <P> Percolating Again . The fall in interest rates is the strongest-though far from the only-sign that cash and credit are again beginning to percolate through an economy that had seemed on the point of running out of lendable money last spring . Banks and savings and loan associations , long strapped for funds , have been taking in abundant new cash . Total time deposits at commercial banks have risen 21% in the past five months , to $211.5 billion . The rise has accelerated since Washington in June permitted the banks to pay any rate they wished on large time deposits . The banks can lend more of the money too-directly or through the bond market-because the Federal Reserve Board has also reduced the proportion that they must keep in reserve . S and Ls took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the month . As a result , they were able to make $2 billion of new mortgage loans in July , 5% more than a year earlier-the first such year-to-year increase in twelve months . <P> There are several reasons why money is becoming more available . Business demand for loans has ebbed with the nation 's economic slowdown , making it easier for banks to meet the remaining loan demand . The commercial and industrial loan volume of major New York City banks has dropped $1.6 billion so far this year , v. a $630 million rise in the equivalent 1969 period . Consumers lately have been saving an unusually high 7.6% of their incomes , largely because they fear further rises in unemployment .
