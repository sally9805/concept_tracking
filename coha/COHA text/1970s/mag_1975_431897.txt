 | The first suggestion of trouble came almost three years ago when Ruth Bratton refused to jump into the water at her swimming lesson . She was six then , a chunky blonde child , full of mental and physical energy constantly looking for a place to explode . She 'd never had any fear of the water , so her parents were surprised when they heard what had happened . Surprised and curious . Then Ruth began to have difficulty with steps , navigating them with an odd , stiff-legged gait that was accentuated when she was getting in and out of cars . Her parents , now concerned , began watching her more closely . When they saw a trembling in her hands that caused her to squeeze a pencil in her fist if she wanted to write or draw , earlier reports from her kindergarten teacher that Ruth was having a coordination problem on the playground suddenly took on new significance . Sheri Bratton remembers her daughter bursting into tears when Sheri told her to " hurry up and put on your shoes " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " says Sheri today , " I did n't understand . " When school was out that year , Sheri and Bill Bratton took their four children ? Tommy , four ; David , two ; and baby Beth , in addition to Ruth ? on an auto trip . Ruth 's frustrations continued . The Bratton family stayed with Sheri 's sister in northern California and she asked Sheri why Ruth was " walking so strangely . " Ruth was terrorized by a ricocheting  | tetherball one day , and her problems in getting in and out of the car increased . Back at school after the trip , Ruth 's anxieties seemed to explode the day there was an unexpected fire drill during the lunch hour . The other children rushed from the room , but Ruth sat at her desk and cried and cried . She said it was because she did n't want to leave her lunch unattended ? but the teacher wondered aloud to Sheri if it was because this little girl , long accustomed to being a leader , suddenly found she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's when Sheri told her pediatrician about Ruth 's problems , and he suggested the child be taken to a neurologist at a nearby hospital . Ruth seemed happy to go ; she thought perhaps the doctor could help her to walk better , but when she found she could n't perform such skill tests as putting a nail in a proper-sized hole , she became more and more apprehensive . The neurologist summoned Bill and Sheri and told them their daughter had a form of cerebral palsy and her condition would probably not get any worse . The parents were bewildered ; they knew CP was a birth disease , and Ruth had appeared so normal for so long . It did n't seem possible . Distraught , they watched Ruth steadily worsen . The children at school teased her constantly , and she would come home in tears , frustrated almost beyond endurance . So , the parents began to investigate special classes for children who were handicapped by coordination problems . When Ruth did n't qualify because she was two years ahead of her class in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for the physically handicapped near the Bratton home . The woman doctor , who examines prospective students there , admitted Ruth as soon as she saw her walk . She also suggested that the Brattons get another diagnosis from a highly respected pediatric neurologist connected with the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles . When the neurologist examined Ruth , he had her admitted to the UCLA hospital for further testing . To Sheri and Bill Bratton , that was the longest week of their lives . " Up to then , " says Bill , " everything had been beautiful . I had a good job I liked . and I was doing well . We 'd just bought a new house . And , most important of all , we had the finest ? and , we thought . the healthiest ? family anyone could imagine . " Bill and Sheri are in their early thirties . Bill is tallish , lean , toughmuscled , with thinning hair and a straight , level , no-nonsense approach about him that is softened by a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dresden-pretty with an air of slightly repressed animation reflected constantly in lively blue eyes . They met in high school , courted , split up for a year when they went to different colleges , then dropped out of school and got married . Bill is a longshoreman ; he works hard and makes good money . Sheri worked until Ruth came along . The Brattons had had trouble starting their family . When they decided ? after two years of marriage ? that they wanted children , nothing happened . It took three more years and some medical help before Ruth was conceived . After that , the children came  | less than two years apart and Sheri was busy running her home and family . And feeling very fulfilled . Ruth 's sickness was the first serious trouble either Sheri or Bill had ever known . They visited the hospital every afternoon and evening , and on each t visit , the doctor would tell them all the things Ruth did n't have . On the sixth day , he said he 'd ruled out every possibility except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was . Several days after the Brattons took Ruth home , they were summoned and told ? gently but unequivocally ? that their daughter was going to die , probably within a few years . And there was nothing that anyone could do about it . Ruth is the victim of a rare genetic disease called Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) . The tests that led to her diagnosis were made by a young research physician named Michael Philipart , who specializes in genetic diseases . As Dr. Philipart ? a precise , soft-spoken , meticulous scientist with chin whiskers and a gentle manner ? explained it to me , MLD is caused by the absence of an enzyme whose function is to break down fatty tissue around the conductors of the nervous system . When this substance builds up sufficiently , it slowly and inexorably chokes off the nervous system until the victim dies . Dr. Philipart compared it to a plugged faucet in which the foreign matter in the pipes slowly backs up until it finally clogs the central system and chokes it off . MLD is passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease . Since the health of carriers is not affected , a person who carries these genes has no way of knowing it until he or she produces children in partnership with another carrier . But the greatest MLD tragedy of all is the type manifested by Ruth Bratton ? a type which does n't show itself until the age of six or seven . By that time , the Brattonsunknowingly carrying this lethal combination of genes ? had produced three other children . " We knew by the time we had that conference , " says Sheri , " that there was something severely wrong with Ruth . I suppose we were as prepared as possible for that kind of news . The doctor said there was nothing he could do for Ruth medically , but he told us there was some hope in research then under way . He also said that if the disease ran its course , Ruth would not be aware of what was happening to her at the end ? which would be a blessing . " Sheri and Bill were so numbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a final request from the hospital : that they bring in three-day urine samples from the rest of the children as soon as possible ( " a difficult order as far as Beth was concerned , " says Sheri . " She was n't potty-trained yet " ) . Along with the samples , the doctors took a tiny piece of skin from each of the children and the parents . This was in mid-March 1973 . Sheri and Bill were told it would be three months before the results of the tests would be known . ( The skin had to be given time to grow and propagate in a laboratory before the new cells it generated could be tested for evidence of MLD . ) Those were trying months that strained every bit of emotional strength Sheri and Bill could muster . " As Ruth got worse , " Sheri recalls , " we began to look harder and harder at the other kids , to see whether we could recognize any signs in them . It 's so easy to see things that are n't there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you watch . " They got a walker for Ruth , but within a month , she could no longer use it . Although her mind was still sharp , her speech slowed down and slurred perceptibly . And her motor re-  | sponses disintegrated almost day by day . " Over those awful months , " says Sheri , " I suppose we conditioned ourselves . Tommy is so strong and physical we felt there was no way under the sun he could be afflicted . But we were suspicious about David . I do n't really know why ; some intangible something we could n't put our finger on worried us about him . And Beth was so young and so healthy , we were certain she was all right . Since we 'd been told that mathematically only one in four children produced by carriers should be afflicted , we could hope there would be no more bad news at all . " As the deadline approached and passed , Sheri remembers that " every time the phone rang , we shook . " Sheri 's parents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the hospital early in July to hear the results , they asked if there was word on the children . They were told there was , but the doctors wanted to consult about it . Frantically , Sheri phoned for news . " When we were told to come in , we knew the news was bad . If it was good , they would have given it to us on the phone . " In agonized silence , Sheri and Bill drove to the hospital . " The doctor was kind , " says Bill , " but he did n't beat around the bush . Tommy ? although a carrier ? was all right , but David and Beth were both afflicted . I guess by that time we had prepared ourselves to hear that David was sick . But not Beth , too . God , not Beth . " MLD is fatal . There are no degrees of the disease and there is no case on record of a remission . But the Brattons were offered a wisp of hope . Their two younger children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just might come up with something . The drive home was a nightmare " an hour in the car , " says Sheri , " to try and absorb all that . " Her thoughts were chaotic , but they mostly centered on Beth ? Beth climbing joyously on top of the family car ... Beth working a jigsaw puzzle before she was two . " The day after was horrible ; I suppose the worst day I 've had . I got up early , and the kids were their usual happy selves , dancing around the room , giggling and laughing . I started to fix breakfast , but about halfway through , I could n't handle it any more . I ran into the bedroom and broke down . I ca n't stand to look at them , ' I told Bill . " Somehow , they got through those days . " We do n't go to church , " says Sheri , " but we have strong feelings inside ourselves , and we drew on them . " " I went through a long period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when I did n't want to do anything . 1 just sat . I lost all interest , all ambition . " The Brattons had been offered a friend 's motor home for a month to take a family vacation . In spite of the fact that Ruth was now almost immobilized , they decided to go ? " to take our last vacation all together . " They puttered through California , Oregon and Washington , too busy with the mechanics of the trip to do much thinking . " There were lots of problems , " recalls Bill , " lots of things we could n't do because of Ruth , but the other kids never seemed restless or resentful because of that . We tried to find something each day we could all do . I got a wheelchair to take Ruth through a famous garden . We rode on an old-fashioned railroad and a ferry boat , and I carried Ruth through a volcanic cave . " On the way back , they stopped at a lake campground to spend the night . Sheri was fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth was laughing with them when suddenly she choked and began gasping for breath . Bill stretched her out on a picnic table and gave her mouth-tomouth resuscitation while Sheri phoned for the rescue squad . A few minutes later a team arrived with an inhalator , and Sheri and Bill drove 30 miles to the nearest hospital in the sheriff 's car , with Ruth breathing  | oxygen in the back seat . We asked some complete strangers , who happened to he at that campground , to look out for the other kids , and they said , Sure . Go . And do n't worry . ' " Ruth began breathing on her own in a few hours , but the hospital kept her three days for observation . When she was released , the Brattons set out on their homeward trip , stopping to eat or rest only where they could get quickly to a hospital in the event of an emergency . There was none , but that trip taught them to " live each day at a time . Today is the important day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has enabled Sheri and Bill to survive ? that plus the entrance into their lives of a young , vital , lifegiving force named Dr. Michael Kaback . He has been working on genetic diseases since he interned a decade ago at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore . His knowledge and skill seem to transcend science . One of his first patients as an intern was a tenyear-old child with terminal cancer . He watched the family fall apart as the girl 's illness progressed . and finally he could stand it no longer . " I understood then , " he says , " that part of a doctor 's job is to restrict the damage of such a situation to as few people as possible . The physician must try to minimize the tragedy to one ? and to use whatever skills he has to that end . " He was able to orient his young patient 's family to life instead of to death , and ? literally ? to save them . Since then , he has worked with hundreds of terminally ill child patients , spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , and trying with a kind of quiet desperation to seek cures with one hand while treating emotional distress with the other . Dr. Kaback is a stocky man in his midthirties ? sandy-haired and moustached , warm , engaging , vulnerable . When he talks about his work his eyes are as eloquent as his words . " We must educate people about their own biology , " he says . " Out of every hundred individuals born , several have some type of genetic disease , and everyone is a carrier of some deleterious genes . When a wrong combination occurs , it can produce tragic results . People who have afflicted loved ones must understand their situation without being traumatized by it . With understanding , they will somehow find the resources to survive . I 've seen it happen again and again . There is magnificence in human beings . " In mid-1973 , Dr. Kaback established his practice in a hospital near the Brattons and . soon after , began seeing them ? both individually and as a family ? regularly . " They needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's absolutely essential to get families in such situations to verbalize their feelings . I tell the Brattons they simply ca n't suppress what 's in their hearts or the disease will destroy them , too . I get them talking about subjects that many families ca n't bring out in the open ? like guilt and institutionalization ? which . incidentally , is often better for a child . From our discussions , I 've learned what great love these people have . Like most parents , they want their child at home . though . . . . They 're marvelous people ? not unique , but marvelous . " Slowly , Sheri and Bill Bratton ? with Dr. Kaback 's help ? have found a kind of emotional equilibrium . Bratton is not their real name . They did n't want that used because they have n't yet talked with the other children ? particularly Tommy ? about the situation they face , and they do n't want that awareness coming to them from a stranger who might happen to read this article . The reason they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be educated about the dangers of genetic diseases and should support the research now being done in a number of centers . The Brattons are , of course , running a race with death . They hope and pray each day that a breakthrough can be found in time to save Beth and David . Dr. Kaback raises no false hopes . He sees no breakthroughs in the im-  | mediate future , but says they are possible ? nothing more . Research in the U.S. has been considerably restricted by recent cutbacks in support from the Federal government . Substantial redirecting of funds ? away from basic research toward health service ? has also occurred in recent years . But nevertheless there have been some areas of progress ? and encouraging signs that there may be more . The research falls into two categories : prevention of genetic disease by foreknowledge , and potential treatment of such diseases once they occur . " We 've made great strides in the prenatal detection of MLD , " says Dr. Kaback . " Ten years ago , we could offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a 25 percent chance that the disease would appear . The futility of that information often led to the disruption of families , at worst ; and no more children , at best . But now tests have been developed that can detect MLD in the fetus , and this , at least , gives the parents the option of aborting an affected fetus early in the pregnancy and then trying again . Since each pregnancy in a couple at risk for MLD has a 75 percent chance of producing a healthy baby , these tests make it possible for MLD parents to give birth only to unaffected children . " Right now , the tests are complicated and require time and a good deal of technical knowledge . We are hoping ? and working ? toward a simple blood test that can be given to young couples and then run quickly through a computer which will indicate whether or not their combination of genes could produce afflicted children . That 's still some years off , but it is certainly possible . " Meanwhile , we 're searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing is an enzyme catalyst to break down the fatty buildup that clogs the nervous system . And we 've tried to put it back , but it simply has n't worked . When the enzyme is put directly into the blood , it does n't get into the nervous system , and when it is injected directly into the spinal fluid , a violent reaction has resulted . So now we are trying a different approach in the laboratory ; we 're working on eliminating the fatty material without harming anything else . The work is just beginning , but there is some hope that it might succeed . We will go as fast as funds and manpower permit . " Meanwhile , Bill and Sheri Bratton are taking life a day at a time . So far , Bill 's medical insurance and growing support from public and private agencies have paid most of the bills ; the rest have been paid with the family 's savings . As to the future , they know their expenses are going to continue for a long time , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want is support for basic research on MLD . Money is something they can earn ; hope must come from the laboratory . At this writing , Ruth clings to life . She can no longer speak or perform any motor functions , and her body is so rigid she 's unable to sit in a conventional wheelchair . But her parents have had a reclining chair built for her and she still manages to go to school . Ten months ago , when I last visited her there , the Easter bunny was on hand to entertain the children . Ruth 's eyes lit up with excitement . Today she knows little of what goes on around her . David is a quiet , rather intense child with luminous , soulful eyes ? husky. blond , affectionate . Beth is tiny , plump . pigtailed , pretty and supercharged with energy . They both attend a preschool where Sheri works once a week . The only sign that death may be waiting in the wings for them both is that David is beginning to show signs of coordination problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bratton child not touched by the disease . " He 's the one I 'm most concerned about , " says Dr. Kaback . " The basic question has to be : what is this going to do to him ? Some way must b ..  | found for him to live through what lies ahead . He must not be afraid to talk about his brother and sisters , he must not fantasize or secretly fear that the disease will happen to him , too . He must somehow ? along with his parents ? be brought through this emotionally healthy . " Bill and Sheri know this , and they are now agonizing with the problem of how , whether and how much to tell Tommy and David and Beth . There are no easy answers , and none is being suggested . " The most important issue , " says Dr. Kaback , " is that although the patients may die , the family must n't . The real tragedy of this disease is when it takes the healthy with the sick . We just ca n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , are determined it wo n't happen . Says Bill pensively : " I guess I 'm not bitter or angry . It 's easy to say it is n't fair or the odds are so high that this could n't happen . But it did happen , and we must deal with it . You keep yourself busy , your mind active ? that 's the key to surviving . " The bad time for me is that half hour between turning off the light at night and going to sleep . Sometimes that half hour turns into four or five hours that seem endless . But we have maybe ten years of serious illness coming up in this house , and I 've made up my mind that for my wife 's sake and Tommy 's , I 've somehow got to get through all this , because I 'm the provider . That 's what I 'm going on . I know that if I fold up , I 'm likely to drag them down with me ? and I 'm not going to let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the kids says I want to be this or that when I grow up . What can I say except , ' Sure , go to it " ? It 's natural and fun to think about what your children are going to be like when they grow up . The girl Ruth used to go to kindergarten with lives right down the street , and when I get in my truck to go to work and pass her riding her bicycle or skating , it 's tough . Really tough . But then I go back to living today . Just today . And trying to hope for tomorrow . " Adds Sheri : " When we were waiting for the results of those tests , I thought that if any of the other children were afflicted , I 'd lose my mind . But somehow you do n't . You find resources to draw on . This year , Easter has a special meaning to me . I 've been thinking about resurrection a lot ? especially during the long nights that Bill is working and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough answers , but I think about God a good deal ? and somehow , I 've found the strength to go on . " When I first heard about Beth and David , all I wanted was to quit ? withdraw from life . And then I had a talk with myself . I asked myself : What good is it going to do to quit ? ' I have Tommy to think of , and Bill who is so wonderful with me and the children . So gentle . And I 've learned to live each day at a time , to savor that day ? and to keep active . " So the human spirit lives and regenerates itself in the Bratton family . And Dr. Mike Kaback looks in his test tubes for hope . " When a child is born with MLD or any other congenital defect , " he says , " there are simply no rules to go by ? except , perhaps , to get the people involved to talk about feelings , about sharing , about loving . " I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Researchers all over the world , doing the same kind of work , are in close communication . Many of them know about the Brattons because I 've told them . They 're looking for solutions , too , and I will know within hours if anyone , anywhere in the world , discovers anything that might help . " So the Brattons wait . And love . And share . And live a full day at a time . And demonstrate with almost every word and action the beauty and resiliency of the human spirit .
