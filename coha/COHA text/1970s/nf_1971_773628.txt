txt PLAYTHINGS OF THE PAST 1 Advertisement Dolls and Toys In the sixteenth century craftsmen were making toys , as a side-line of their trade , out of silver and gold and alabaster . Materials as fine as this were certainly not meant for the wear and tear of the nursery ; they were mainly to amuse adults who followed the craze of forming collections , which was just then becoming a fashionable pastime . There were , of course , humbler woodcarvers , particularly on the Continent , making toys for children , and also potters making animals , whistles and toy tea-sets , as well as glass-blowers , who produced enchanting little jugs and glasses and miniature animals . These men lived mostly in the forest areas of Europe , through which all trade passed on the rough roads . They were kept busy all the summer attending to the horse-drawn traffic but in the winter they had plenty of time to apply themselves to a hobby . So they amused themselves by fashioning toys . Of course there were no factories then in the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shops was not general . But soon the toy makers were writing out lists of prices to show travelling salesmen and by the eighteenth century the agent appears on the scene . These middlemen soon established businesses all over Europe and catalogues , first described as " magazines " , were produced towards the end of the eighteenth century . // By 1850 most specialist toy-shops were issuing these catalogues and the earliest known one , produced by a certain Mr Bestelmeier of Nuremberg , contained over ' , zoo entries , boasting , in what has become customary advertising style , of his superlative toys for sale . The nineteenth century saw a great boom in advertising . A flamboyant character calling himself " Professor " Holloway , for instance , concocted some pills and a " universal " ointment which he publicized with such success that he can fairly be classed as the very first worldwide advertiser . By 1842 , four years after he had started his business , he spent L5,000 a year in singing the praises of his concoctions all over England and Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 843 Punch remarked astringently , " Mr Holloway , with the modesty which is the invariable attendant on real merit , declares that his universal ointment ' will mend the legs of men and tables equally well and will be found an excellent article for frying fish in . " Throughout the age of Victoria it seems to have been socially acceptable for the " higher classes " to lend their names to any number of commodities . The Queen 's household , as well as the impoverished Czars and other crowned heads of Europe , were advertised as using countless remedies . Another purveyor of pills enrolled no less than fifty noblemen and fifteen bishops in his register of self-styled satisfied customers . " Sendaway offers " , however , seem to have been a speciality of the twentieth century and though its origins are difficult to trace it is probable that the beautiful wax dolls , which can be seen at the Harris Museum , Preston , and were given away in exchange for tea-wrappers , were among the earliest advertisement gifts and surely the queen of this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new paper toy " the dressingup doll " cut out of cardboard , 8 in. high and dressed in underclothes , was invented in England . Equipped with six sets of dresses and headdresses made out of paper , she was called " The English Doll " . One hundred years later William Barbour &; Sons , linen thread manufacturers from Ireland , advertised " Barbour 's Dolls " . These were a // set of twelve dolls for three penny stamps , representing countries , period dresses and flowers including " Little Buttercup " , which dates it nicely with the successes of Gilbert and Sullivan . Among other things the Mazawattee Tea Company gave away a game of Kings and Queens , while " Force " , the breakfast food , arrived on the English breakfast table from America where it had its debut in 189o . " Sunny Jim " soft dolls were given away for a certain number of wrappers , " Dolly Dimple " was given away for Oxo coupons and Field 's coffee offered a figure of a dandy with an eyeglass grimacing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaming over a cup of Field 's brew . Pictures were frequently given away in postcard size or larger , and these in Victorian and Edwardian times were generally of personalities in the public eye or of royalties . Statuettes were handed out , pin-on badges , books and blotters . Sir John Millais ' famous Bubbles was , of course , bought by Pears ' Soap to become an advertising feature for the firm , and other artists such as Landseer followed suit . Even the Queen lent her image to further the sale of Hudson 's Dry Soap ? " the Subjects ' Best Friend " . There must be many of these free gifts hidden away in drawers or attics , for thank goodness there are hoarders still . A menace to their poor relatives , yet their dislike of throwing things away just in case they might come in handy one day at least has saved quite a little ephemera to amuse the social historian and throw light on customs and habits of the past which might otherwise have been forgotten . 42 2 Chiefly Dolls Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in dolls of the past . In fact it is quite difficult now to find them at a reasonable price . The early ones have long been sought after by discerning collectors and by museums . A few months ago a diligent collector was told about a Queen Anne period doll that had just appeared in an antique shop forty miles away . Alas , she arrived too late : a museum had already snapped it up . This , of course , is really a matter for rejoicing , as these most popular of toys are still to be found cherished and preserved in museums all over the country . New ones are opening devoted entirely to dolls and toys , so that at least those which have survived the years of being jumbled into nursery cupboards and played with by children whose parents have not taught them to respect beautiful things , are now on view to the general public . Dolls go back , of course , into the earliest known civilizations , though many historians believe that the early ones were given a double role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly they were handed over to the children as playthings . The fashion doll , very much later , undoubtedly played this dual part . One was sent as an example of the best-dressed lady in France to the court of Edward II . She was the ancestor of a long line of these models , exquisitely clothed in all the elegance of the latest toilettes . Subsequently they were given to the children when the next ambassadress of la mode arrived . // English fashion dolls do not apparently come on the scene until the days of Queen Anne , but they continued to be used well into the nineteenth century . Sometimes they were made of cardboard , presumably for easier despatch , with their paper sets of dresses and hats beautifully painted by hand . The so-called " bagman 's dolls " were christened by this name because itinerant salesmen carried them on horseback in their bags . In fact , the lay figures in our shop windows today are the descendants of these same " bagman 's dolls " . For the amateur collector it is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll to be found . The eighteenthcentury doll is outside our scope as collectors of Victoriana , but should you see one of these " babies " , as they were called then , do n't be put off by an appearance that may seem superficially unattractive . In 1969 a late eighteenth-century turned wood doll , with the usual inlaid enamel eyes with dark brown irises and no pupils and a few scanty wisps of brown hair nailed to the lightly carved head , was on sale at a well-known London saleroom . Her body and face were covered in gesso and a pale pinkish paint , her lower legs were missing and the one kid arm with its glovelike hand was pushed into the two holes in her shoulder . Originally the arms would have been fastened by a leather thong . This poor sad-looking creature , with only a much later dress to cover her bad plight , fetched ? 140 . On the other hand , the dolls of later periods , unless they are the lovely Jumeau fashion dolls , or those made by Bru or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good condition before a collector buys it at a high price . It is also important to study your subject by going to specialist museums and reading some of the excellent books by experts . John Noble , Curator of the Toy Collection of the Museum of the City of New York , has written an excellent book on the subject of dolls which is within the price-range of all of us . He has a useful section on " Hints for collectors " , reminding us that there are many fakes about . He also wisely points out that quality rather than quantity gives the greatest satisfaction . Other books of value are mentioned in the Bibliography . // Fakes are coming mostly from the Continent , and it is the bisque dolls which are mostly being reproduced only too effectively . Sometimes heads do n't belong to their right bodies , but in many of these cases if the heads and the bodies ate old they may have been repaired a long time ago . The fakes have nylon wigs , quite unmistakably modern , and the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their bodies are badly proportioned and the clothes are usually machine-stitched . Of course it is perfectly permissible to restore old dolls , but many of us prefer to leave them , scars and all , with their character unaltered . The trouble with re-wigging , re-dressing and touching up with paint , is that the charm and individuality is often lost . Nevertheless , wonders are often accomplished by careful and trained experts and the answer probably is that we must accept the two schools of thought . The restorers are very different from the fakers , who are unforgivable . England introduced the baby doll about 185o , so little girls could mother and cuddle something a bit more lifelike than the women dolls from the dressmakers ' establishments . Gradually the women dolls lost popularity and the men dolls became ever more scarce , except as inmates of dolls ' houses ; though here , too , we find a great paucity of the male sex . It is interesting to see that today the teenager doll is beginning to oust the baby from our toyshops . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first talking dolls came in by about 183o , and obligingly said " Papa " and " Mama " when their arms were moved . But the " shuteyes " were a little earlier still , the eyes opening and shutting by means of a wire pulled at the waist . A collector found one of these dolls a few months ago in working order , though the poor wax face was a network of fine cracks . Later , as a development of the china heads , came the lead weight system , causing the eyes to shut when the doll was laid down , and this method is still in use today . It was not , by the way , until Queen Victoria 's accession that blue eyes became fashionable , instead of the // brown eyes customary in the doll world before this . Blue eyes have remained the most popular colour from that day to this . The scope for collectors is so wide that it is quite difficult to decide on a special line . Some people prefer dolls ' house families on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolls , hunting for the aristocrats of that type , the superb Montari beauties made by Augusta Montari , the wife of the wax modeller , between i 849 and 1886 , and then later by her son , Richard Napoleon Montari . Her dolls were exhibited both at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and at the Paris Exhibition of 1855 . Pierotti , another famous doll maker , came from a family believed to have been making dolls ever since the year I i oo . He carried on his family 's tradition by setting up shop in London in 1880 . If you prefer the wooden deutsch or " dutch " doll , this comes in sizes from less than one inch to over a foot high . The early dolls of this type have little prim faces painted in enamel , with very red cheeks and black hair . Dutch dolls are still being made today , so beware of those which have been splendidly dressed in period materials during the last twenty years or so . Of course , these too have their appeal but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Fashions help to date the doll and so do hairdressing styles . Some dolls have a family history to help , too . A baby doll in my collection has a piece of paper sewn on to her petticoat announcing in spidery letters , " I was bought in London in 18 5 I . " The French Jumeau dolls , introduced about 185o , are considered to be the most lovely bisque dolls ever made . Bisque is simply an unglazed porcelain , by the way , with a matt surface . These Jumeau dolls are famous for their enormous eyes and rather spoilt beauty expressions . Some lucky ones have " paperweight " eyes , made in exactly the same way that the glassmakers used to create their soughtafter Clichy or Barrarat or St Louis paperweights . Between 185o and 1870 the vogue for the new marble-like china called Parian inspired the doll-makers . In this material dolls usually // have their features as well as their elaborately looped and coiled hair modelled and painted . China dolls were generally given black hair but those of Parian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dolls to be found occasionally is the so-called " boxed doll " . In the Harris Museum , Preston , there are two glazed boxes containing charming wax dolls dressed in silk and with flowers in their hair . These were given away in exchange for coupons by tea companies in the 1880s . A delightful wax doll in Jane Austen clothes was found recently in a West country antique shop . She was also in a glazed box , in a grotto of shells , with a woolly lamb by her side . Always keep your eyes open for those rare pedlar dolls with their trays of minute wares . They are sometimes in glazed boxes too . Wooden dolls , papier-mache dolls , wax dolls , they are all collected by men as well as women . It is not possible in a short chapter to do more than skim the surface of this enchanting subject , which is really the history of fashion in its widest sense , for there are dolls dressed as pedlars or gardeners as well as queens and actresses . The dolls Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The early woodens of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were at first beautifully hand carved with articulated limbs and fine features . These were made for creches and were mostly found in Catholic countries . The " Dutch " or deutsch ones are the sort we find today most easily , though the 183o type is the rarer . These have painted faces and shoulders , their hands are fish-tail shaped and the hair is sometimes finished in a bun on the top or a yellow comb . They are generally called " pegwooden " dolls and were made in Bavaria and what is now called the Austrian Tyrol . Delicate grey wisps of hair painted round the face and then black over the head are characteristics of the early examples . They came in several sizes right down to half-an-inch long and these were often nestled into a walnut-shell made into a cradle by an early Victorian child or her governess . In the London Museum you will find this type of doll which was dressed so beautifully by Queen Victoria as a child , helped by her governess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The // Bethnal Green Museum also has a delightful collection of toys and dolls and their small belongings , while another worthwhile visit is to the Museum of Costume in Bath which has a roomful of dolls and their accessories ; there are also the Kirkstall Abbey Museum , Leeds , the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh and many others always open to the public . Here the keen collector can compare his own treasures with the national treasures which belong to us all . ( ii ) PEDLAR DOLLS Dolls , which throughout history have served to mirror their times and give us intimate details of the clothes and customs of their day , were many of them dressed as pedlars all through the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . If you have never seen a pedlar doll you really must make an excuse to go to the Victoria and Albert or Bethnal Green Museums , and there you 'll find a miniature replica of the pedlars who walked the quiet hamlets and country towns of long ago . There is an old woman in a red cloak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny objects from ribbons and laces to jars of pomade and song sheets . She was made about 1830 . The two leather dolls at Bethnal Green , a man and a woman , are earlier , about 1790 ; their weathered old faces breathe out the very essence of the English countryside . The great majority of pedlar dolls were always home-made , generally in England , and date from about 1800 . What is the special fascination of these little figures ? Partly the exquisite workmanship of their small wares and carefully stitched clothes , and partly the fact that we obtain a delicious peep into everyday life some hundred and fifty years ago . Can you imagine the thrill which the traditional cry of the pedlar ringing through the quiet villages brought to the housewives and children ? For they were , in fact , the earliest kind of shop . All sorts of merchandise was displayed for their customers ' delight : the latest // songs , the newest laces and ribbons , pots and pans , and moreover they brought the latest gossip from the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather . Men and young women seem to be rare . There are many old women in red cloaks and black bonnets . I was lucky enough to run to earth a charming young woman dressed very much like Queen Adelaide in bunchy sleeves and a full black velvet skirt . She has a dashing silk bonnet and wears gypsy earrings and is pretty enough to charm the money out of the hardest customer 's pocket . Her goods are in a basket ; the old Scots name for a basket , by the way , was " ped " . She sells ribbons , needle-cases , mending silks , a doll , a parasol , a French song sheet called Le Troubadour and some excellent toasting forks . She also carries a packet of phosphorus matches , which a Frenchman is credited with inventing about 1790 . Her date , however , must be about 183o to judge by her clothes , and her charms are as fresh today as ever they were . The historians say that the function of these pedlar dolls was to display the innumerable objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . They were not meant for toys . A version of the pedlar is the fortune-telling doll , with a skirt of paper leaves on each of which is a message for the gullible . It is an interesting swing of the pendulum to find that after so many years of fashion dolls intended for the courts and nobility the pedlar dolls became popular . By contrast they show exactly how the working-class people of their day were dressed . They have a different appeal , of course , from their rich sisters , but their gay , colourful and unsophisticated charms have the vitality and engaging naivete of our early Staffordshire pottery . John Noble , Curator of the Toy Collection of the Museum of New York , points out that these pedlar dolls are generally under glass domes . There are also booths and stalls , forerunners of the delightful shops that can occasionally be found . Apparently two identical pedlars were found from different sources , according to Mr Noble , which suggests that they could be bought ready-made , or VICTORIANA perhaps there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare time to make these attractive dolls in the later days of Queen Victoria 's reign . Here , too , we can see the faker at work . Sometimes the reproductions are simply an enjoyable pastime for talented fingers and sometimes deliberate deceptions . It can not be too often reiterated that the innocent amateur should beware of fakes . The big salerooms now sometimes sell collections of dolls and toys and here is another splendid opportunity for the beginner to become the expert , handling the objects and noting the special points that help identification . Many dolls are marked and Gwen White 's book European and American Dolls helps to date your treasure . The pedlar dolls of the mid-Victorian era sometimes were those made up by girls or their helpful relations , making use of the toy-shop accessories to fill the pedlar 's tray . These also were carefully kept under domes and survive happily to this day . The dolls used are sometimes such lovely creatures as those made by Jumeau and by very carefully turning up the hair at the nape of the neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the factory which made the doll . There are pedlar dolls at most museums specializing in toys and dolls . The Tunbridge Wells Museum has some enchanting stallholders and is among the most worthwhile museums to visit . The Rottingdean Toy Museum is another delightful place for toy-addicts to browse . 50 3 Houses and Shops for Dolls Starting as a childhood toy and ending as a collection , the large dolls ' mansion called " Stanbrig Eorls " , which used to belong to Mrs Graham Montgomery , now delights hundreds of visitors to Edinburgh in the fascinating Museum of Childhood . For seventy years the owner cared for this dolls ' house and gradually built up the furnishings , the lighting , the water system and the family , so that it now looks much as any adult house might look after a long period of being lived in by one family of owners . Like its fullsize counterpart this house has known the ravages , luckily not too serious , of a fire , and once a disastrous burst pipe caused a minor flood , but luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bligh family of dolls . Once Mr Bligh mysteriously vanished and Mrs Bligh took a second husband . When the first spouse reappeared , having spent some years exploring the back of a drawer , she very sensibly engaged him as gardener . His splendid set of tools are displayed in a cabinet nearby ; the wooden wheelbarrow , the mowing machine and the roller , the besom , the rake , the fork and spades are all in perfect scale . As for the rooms in the mansion , there surely never was such a large collection of entrancing little pieces , collected through all those seventy years and treasured so carefully . The house , like many another , has a junk room full of cast-off pieces that many of us would give a lot to own . There is something very appealing about a miniature sized home and no wonder they are again being collected and filled with tiny // period pieces . The earliest recorded house , in those days called a Baby House , is Bavarian and it was made in 15 5 8 , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been destroyed in a fire . There is a splendid example of an early house in the Bethnal Green Museum . It was made in Nuremberg about 1673 and it measures 3ft. 6in. high and 3ft. wide . Filled with contemporary or nearcontemporary furnishings , it gives a very good idea of how people lived in the seventeenth century . The Dutch , of course , were the great makers of dolls ' houses and indeed many historians credit them with making the very first models . They called them " cabinets " and these exquisite pieces of workmanship , mounted on stands , were filled with collectors ' prizes , silver and other precious " toys " for the very wealthy and for adults to play with . These were not meant for children . Peter the Great , when he was staying in Holland , admired their celebrated " cabinets " so much that he ordered one to be made for himself . When the estimate of 20,000 guilders was exceeded , however , he decided to leave it behind . Similar beautiful houses can be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For our purposes we must take a look at the Victorian dolls ' houses which were at last meant not for children 's education and for adults ' amusement , but for children actually to play with and enjoy . Luckily Victorian children were generally taught to be very careful of their own property as well as other people 's . Consequently we have a great deal of lovely miniature things still to be found by collectors today . There are mansions with grand staircases , perhaps a bit too large for average homes , but cottages with two rooms would even fit into a flat and there is a great appeal in a house within a house . Some dolls ' house nurseries own a tiny dolls ' house , a Noah 's ark and other toys . Kitchens have a special appeal for girls and the furnishing of a dolls ' room as a kitchen is an even older occupation than making a dolls ' house . The first kitchens were , like the dolls ' houses , educational in purpose . A mid-Victorian kitchen doll was quickly snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first sight she looks like an ordinary doll , but her apron opens up to reveal a kitchen full of pots and pans , dishes and tea-kettles . One collector , the late Madame Helena Rubinstein , collected miniature rooms and among them she had an eighteenth-century dolls ' kitchen together with a poultry yard attached to it , housing some china hens , ducks and turkeys all ready for the pot . There are generally cooks attached to the kitchen , but not always of the period . Some collectors like to keep very strictly to period when furnishing their dolls ' house , and this makes it a most interesting social study . Others prefer to keep all periods in their houses from the date of its supposed building . The question of dates is a vexed one as dolls ' houses are not always in period themselves . The best are the family ones with history to back their claims and date them exactly . Failing this it is often possible to date them from wallpapers . Devoted collectors will strip the little walls down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house collecting at this present time , believes in delicate work with the fingernails . The excitement and satisfaction of finding a name and a date on a dolls ' house thickly covered with modern paint is worth the effort . Dolls ' shops are another branch of dolls ' house collecting and in the way that the kitchens taught children the rudiments of housekeeping , complete with their tiny meat-choppers , coffee-mills , gridirons , bellows , mortars and pestles , spoons , knives and forks , so the shops could provide education with pleasure . The scale is sometimes bigger than the dolls ' houses , and Flora Jacobs , in her book A History of Dolls ' Houses , believes dolls ' shops can not be traced back more than two hundred years . She does point out that in 1696 an inventory of toys belonging to the little Dauphin listed " nine shops of the marketplace " and these were filled with shopkeepers and customers of enamel . But the Victorian period , besides the famous butchers ' shops to be seen in the Bethnal Green Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leghorn and straw models , rolls of minuscule ribbons , lace , tulle and net for covering the bonnets and // tiny feathers as well as hat-boxes for packing these miniature works of art . All sorts of shops and stalls were available to Victorian children , and some of us remember toy sweetshops of the nineteen thirties and earlier which had scales to weigh the nauseous little coloured goodies arranged on the shelves . These late shops are less desirable than the earlier ones as they are all factory made . So for the collector who has room only for the miniature , here is the solution . The possibilities are vast . The dolls ' house could be furnished as a school , an inn , a shop , a museum or an antique shop . The attraction of playing these games of imagination while accumulating valuable and beautiful pieces of past history is also enhanced by the satisfaction of teaching children , in the most enjoyable way , something about history as well as practical contemporary life . 54 4 Tinsel Pictures and Drama The never-ending pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal romance of the theatre can be represented in many different lines . Those delightful theatrical Staffordshire figures are collected by many Victoriana addicts , and as a complement to such an interest the tinsel pictures and the toy theatre provide an excellent foil . Samuel Pollock and his daughter started a shop selling the sheets of figures and scenes . Now their museum is a subject of pious pilgrimage for many lovers of Victoriana . The cardboard actors and actresses have the same robust and vigorous charm as the Staffordshire pottery figures . They were not intended for children originally , any more than dolls ' houses and their priceless miniatures were . They were bought by people who loved the glitter and the gaiety of the stage and collected pictures of their favourite performers . Much later on we were reduced , in both senses of the word , to postcards . The tinsel pictures were sold as prints with the little pieces of gilt and silver , stars , spangles , and bright red and blue strips of paper all ready to decorate at home ; or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Regency days are very much " popular art " and date at least as far back as Garrick . The fashion for decorating prints with pieces of material and coloured papers was known in the eighteenth century and sometimes a collector is lucky enough to run one of these to earth ; but those we are concerned with are the theatrical items of the nineteenth // century . The Vincent Crummles type of acting , popular in Dickens ' day , is exactly suited by the scowling villains and romantic heroes dressed in their tinsel decorations , which publishers sold with the prints for a few pence ; the rosettes , swords and daggers are ready cut out in silver , and even the helmets and breastplates are included as well as a decorative feather or two and a few scraps of silk and satin . They were sold for each particular picture , some of which were big and others quite small . Landscapes and figures on horseback and the scarce ladies give a splendid appearance of sensational drama to your walls . Four figures , six and eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ones . Then whole scenes for the backcloth and sheets of complete sets of characters for plays brought the figures into the realm of " Juvenile Drama " , and very acceptable these are too . They were generally topical , including of course the ever popular pantomime and some of the characters shown were good portraits of the famous actors of the day . The fairytale palaces , the sea landscapes , the burlesque and melodrama on these tiny stages have the flavour of the fairground as well and a vitality all their own . The colours are as vivid now as ever they were , those coloured by hand , and later by stencil . It is impossible to give more than a small taste of the variety of the tinsel pictures and the tiny stage sets . They are so popular that they have been frequently reprinted and for us the modern versions are but a pale copy of the originals . Nevertheless they give us useful clues about what we may find . Although the theatre sheets were intended to be cut out , the unused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . This was the period of overstatement and " ham " acting . We are so used to naturalism and cheap colour production now that it 's difficult to imagine what an impact these rollicking little figures with their tiny stages and backcloths had on the children of the nineteenth century and , of course , on their elders too . 56 5 Money Boxes In 1850 the Temperance Society had a drive to encourage its members to save up to buy a pig for the backyard . This laudable idea originated the name " piggy-bank " . One of the most endearing forms of money box is certainly the domestic animal . About 1790 a Yorkshire pottery made a delightful pair of cows , for example , with a farmer and his wife in charge of them . A calf stands by the wife and a spotted dog guards the farmer . The dog has those typically human arched eyebrows of the period , when the figures were so often decorated by child labour . The farmer 's cow is the money box , appropriately enough . These particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a characteristic said to distinguish the Yorkshire potters ' work ; very few money boxes are marked since they were not really meant for posterity . The progress to wealth in primitive days was through buying beasts , so that animals were , in a way , the earliest forms of money . It suited everyone to be paid for his labour , or his craft or even his bride in cattle . Long ago to speak of a person as being impecunious simply meant he had no cattle and was consequently very poor , the Latin word pecus , of course , means cattle . However , there were a great many advantages in changing from beasts to solid gold bars or , later , coins of gold or silver . These were neither subject to disease nor apt to be driven away by some villain during the night . Advancing civilization , to be sure , has certainly resulted in money being just as easy to steal as cattle , especially if it // is all conveniently stored in a money box or safe . But at first it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristotle declared that money had to be easy to recognize , easy to divide and easy to carry about . That seems to be a characteristic of money from that day to this . We are talking , by the way , of at least 2,000 years ago . Coins as we know them were first struck in the eighth century B.C. Boxes in churches used to be opened on Christmas Day and the contents were called " the dole of the Christmas Box " or sometimes just " box money " . This was distributed by the priest to the deserving ones of his parish on Boxing Day . The tradition of money boxes appears to go back as far as Roman times , but they were then more often shaped like a pot than a box . The Elizabethans seem to have used them a good deal , but the collector will be lucky indeed if he finds one of these , or one of the Stuart period either . These early ones almost always must have been broken open and destroyed , the common fate of pottery money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " an apprentices ' box of earth " or " a money box of potter 's clay " , their loss to collectors is probably not great , aesthetically at least . Elizabethan models were bottle-shaped , with the slot cut at a vertical angle on the wide shoulder . Experts tell us that it was not until after the middle of the seventeenth century that the slots were placed diagonally , but once again they reverted to the older horizontal position by the end of that century . The eighteenth century also inspired a charming , tiered money box or pot which must have been designed to take different denominations of coinage . It 's a wonder that so many of these humble little fabrications have survived , though no doubt they must have been treasured as ornaments and thus saved from destruction . Luckily for us , the Victorian era is the best period to search for our quarry , and we shall find the most delightful assortment of boxes to induce thrift . The original earthenweare barrel or cone-shaped type , hand-modelled and decorated with contrasting streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the earliest kind of money // box we are likely to find and these are eighteenth century . With tremendous luck we might possibly discover an English delft-ware example . These were first made in Lambeth in the mid-seventeenth century and the white surface is decorated in deep blue and perhaps green or purplish brown and black . If you do find one , treat it as suspect , for there are all too many reproductions : and then , if by some miracle the experts decide it is genuine , you 'll be correspondingly elated . Gradually , money box designs became so appealing that the owners must have hated to break them open to reach their nest-egg . The judiciously inserted knife , perhaps rather roughly handled , has obviously been used in some pottery slots . The eighteenth-century chickens on their high nests , surmounted by a fine hen , are often white on a chocolate-coloured ground or sometimes a reddish earthenware with a golden glaze . They were generally too much prized by their owners to be smashed open . Sometimes the hen is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins . Sussex potteries occasionally impressed their names on speckled hens or mottled pigs , which were made there first of all in the eighteenth century and then throughout the nineteenth . Rockingham made rich brown-glazed money boxes , but that particular glaze with its curious purplish bloom , was also made elsewhere . Thrift was a mid-nineteenth-century virtue inspired by Queen Victoria and her husband , Albert the Good . The rise of the prosperous middle-classes was built on saving . It is , then , not surprising to find these money boxes were so popular . The variety is almost inexhaustible in pottery alone . There are cottages and beehives , cows , dogs , cats and lions , chests of drawers , hat-boxes , busts of familiar figures and some examples that can be collected in pairs , like the lions and cows . The cats and dogs very often appear as heads only , like the decapitated housewife or soldier inkpots of the nineteenth century . There are many wooden money boxes too , in the shape of banks , some with charming Gothic windows of brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pears , is not hard to find . The castiron and tinware boxes are most amusing , too , as they frequently have a mechanism that works at the drop of a coin . William Tell , for instance , knocks the apple off his son 's head with a powerful looking cross-bow armed with a coin . The bucking mule tips off its Negro jockey so that the penny flies out of his mouth into the slot in the box on which they are stationed . The smiling Negro with his moving hand that throws a penny into his mouth is another mechanical money box , but he is much copied and not particularly captivating to most of us . A charming old man in an armchair , also made of cast-iron , is another American production and a very cosy addition to the nursery mantelpiece . Many of these toys have a registration mark to date them , which is always popular with collectors . An eighteenth-century house with gaudy brass decorations and a 1797 cartwheel penny over its door was a particularly happy find a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door represent the tethering post for the horses belonging to the bank 's customers . The owner of a similar money box not long ago explained that his had been made for a village boy by the local blacksmith in George III 's reign . It proved to be the groundwork to the boy 's fortune , for the threepenny pieces he popped into the elegant miniature Georgian bank enabled him to buy his first cow and he died a rich farmer . His descendants , still farming , have lived to tell the story of the savings bank which is now back in the hands of the family of the man who made it . It was clearly long before the Victorian era that saving was not only customary but encouraged , for in February 1750 the timehonoured phrase " Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves " was coined by old Mr Lowndes , Secretary of the Treasury during the reigns of William and Mary , Queen Anne and George I , if we are to believe the pontifical Lord Chesterfield , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son . He adds , pertinently enough , " To this maxim , which he not only preached but practised , his two grandsons owe the very considerable fortune he left them . " 6o MONEY BOXES Alas , there is not that incentive to thrift today . But perhaps a discerning choice of money boxes to hand down to one 's grandchildren might profit them nearly as well . Let that serve for a good excuse to search for a few of these really enchanting little boxes . 6z 6 Toys for the Victorian Child A point about toys frequently overlooked is the fact that generally speaking they have been made by adults for other adults to buy for their children . The line can not be drawn very easily between grownups and children in the realm of toys , for a great many objects appeal to all age-groups . Model soldiers , for instance , can be little painted wooden figures from Germany , or papier-mache regiments suitable to be mown down by toy guns , or those authentic models dressed in full regalia , correct to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those miniature works of art made for royal nurseries or collectors by enamellers in Limoges , craftsmen in SaintClaude , Hamburg and Nuremberg and silversmiths in Holland . These last artists made furnishings for dolls ' houses which were played with by both generations . In fact , anything adult size could be and was made doll-size . How irresistible the magic of well-designed toys is for most of us . Even all those solemn games of instruction , the building outfits , the alphabets and multiplication tables , the jigsaws ? known until the end of the nineteenth century as " dissected puzzles " ? the religious toys of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , which were intended for Catholic children 's diversion on Sabbath days , have considerable appeal for us today . There are tiny wooden altars , with accessories made out of tin , which used to be much in demand in France and elsewhere on the Continent , as well as brass chalices , holy-water sprinklers , missal-holders and crucifixes for dolls . Even musical boxes , 6z TOYS FOR THE VICTORIAN CHILD giving out strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playing at being priests and choir boys must have had just as much appeal as playing doctors and nurses or engine-drivers and shopkeepers during the week . Roman Catholic children must have enjoyed Sundays very much . As for the Protestant children , by the 1830s their Sundays kept them restricted to looking at pictures or solving jigsaw puzzles illustrating Bible stories . They could also enjoy building churches out of blocks and best of all they were allowed to play with the ever-popular Noah 's Ark . The best period for these arks is said to be between 186o and 187o , when Noah and his family gathered as many as four hundred animals under their all-embracing roof . The favoured pairs included insects , and we find butterflies , spiders painted an innocuous battleship grey and occasionally pairs of grasshoppers and flies . The earliest period in which a collector might expect to find an ark is the middle of the eighteenth century , though rumour has it that they were being made as early as the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries . Farmyard animals were certainly made then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the horses and donkeys and cows in the holy stables . However , no ark has actually been documented , though suspicion rests on Thuringia , in Saxony , as a possible birthplace of the idea , because their carved dolls bear a strong family likeness to Noah and his wife and sons . The mass-produced variety of ark made its appearance about i 800 , and the early animals were very crudely carved and given only a few spots of colour . Nor did the designers worry too much about scale . The grasshopper is nearly as big as a rhinoceros , and the rhinoceros looks remarkably like a deer with an extra horn on its nose . Butterflies are as big as lions . Never mind . That may well be part of their attraction . Children have never been great sticklers for accuracy in dimensions and imagination takes care of any little discrepancies like that . Germany has always been foremost in her skill at modelling wooden figures of men as well as animals and her folk toys are still being carved in the old tradition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving the same group of animals over and over again , thus becoming adepts at the art . There is a nineteenth-century book called " Untrodden Peaks " which describes an old German peasant who has carved cats , dogs and sheep , wolves and elephants her whole life long , to the tune of about a thousand , in two different sizes , each year . She had learnt the skill from her mother , the mother from her mother , and so the traditional craft was handed down . Noah 's arks decorated with straw-work are most attractive . Some were made by French prisoners-of-war , notably the example at Bethnal Green Museum , dated c. 1810 and authenticated as having been the work of prisoners at Norman Cross Prison , Huntingdon . It is just as well to mention , as we are talking about straw-work , that prisoners-of-war did not by any means have a monopoly of straw-work marquetry , as one might suppose by the enormous number of objects invariably described as their work by many dealers and collectors . The arks , by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Murray , curator of the fascinating Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh , reminds us that the word " toy " dates only from the sixteenth century and then included " anything from buttons to shoebuckles or sword hilts " . Now there are many museums specializing in children 's toys , and others which reserve a corner for them . They are , after all , an interesting study of social history and their variety is enormous . The earlier ones were often educational in their intention . There are many collectors who specialize in one aspect of this wide field . Doll collectors , with sub-divisions for wax , china , wooden , costume or automata are now in their thousands . Men , naturally enough , tend to collect mechanical toys , perhaps the delightful balance models , counter-weighted so that they swing or twirl , never tumbling over . This idea seems to have come to Europe in the sixteenth century from the East . The simplest version is the " roly-poly " , sometimes called a tumbler or " Kelly " by the Americans . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be collected , from simple stringworked figures , whose origin goes back five thousand years , to the // late eighteenth-century figures weighted to tumble down ladders . A brain-child of the French toymaker was the little cardboard figure painted gaily and animated by wire , leather or string , according to its date . It is a form of marionette and is called in France a pantin , after a village where the inhabitants were renowned for their dancing . The most popular toys collected by adults today are certainly the clockwork ones . Some are animated by sand or bellows or steam . Fernand Martin is a famous name in the world of nineteenth-century clockwork toys . His lively barber endlessly polishing the bald pate of a customer with a hair-restorer , or another toy featuring a convivial fellow in a top hat trying to drink out of his bottle and to keep his balance , are both collectors ' pieces now and go to show the thin line drawn between an adult 's sophisticated taste and that of a child . Here we have a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toy-maker is a constant source of astonishment and pleasure to all ages . The little German soldier puffing at his pipe from which real smoke belches , the elegant little roundabouts fitted with doll riders and musical boxes , the realistic goat-landau driven by two fashionable French dolls , the goat rolling realistically from side to side , all these and many more can still be found by luck or perseverance today . Their price , however , is sometimes out of all proportion to their intrinsic value . // GLASS 1 Glassblowers ' Friggers A newspaper dated i 823 gives an account of a trade procession of the glassblowers , who displayed their exquisitely delicate and colourful work to the admiration of the bystanders . This particular procession carried a glass fort with glass cannons from which , believe it or not , salutes were fired . There was , moreover , a glass windmill , with moving sails and a glass bugle that really blew a martial blast , accompanied by the musical tinkle of coloured glass handbells . These fascinating examples of the skill of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland " whigmeleeries " , though you may not find either word in your dictionary . They first seem to have appeared in the late eighteenth century , though bells were produced as early as the mid-seventeenth century . Handbells were originally frigged in the sense of being experimental pieces made out of the glass left over at the end of the day and perhaps sold to visitors for the price of a pint of beer . Bottle glass , out of which some of the early bells were made , was not subject to the crippling tax levied on the best quality glass . Later on it was found that bells showed off to a nicety the varieties of coloured glass , and they were therefore made commercially in emerald , red , green or opaque white glass and given knopped flint glass handles with elegant multicoloured twists . Strictly speaking , therefore , these later , more attractive bells can not be called friggers . Many of the little spun and lamp-blown toys were the work of // the travelling glassblowers , who carried with them their small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They produced any little trifle on demand , either for the merry-makers at the village fairs or for the cottagers outside their doors . They could blow a bird of paradise with a shimmering blue , white and pink spun glass tail , or a walking stick to fend off the dreaded ague , a basket , a top hat or a candlestick . The children may have clamoured for those early marbles , which are so easily distinguished from their uninspired modern counterparts by their delicate spirals of colour twists . If you are lucky you can still find tiny King Charles 's spaniels encrusted with tight glass curls , and the featherweight dolls ' tea-sets in opaque glass with minute flower decorations . The Bristol Museum has a collection of charming friggers including a glass spaniel , a miniature eighteenth-century scent bottle and some fairy-like drinking glasses about an inch high , with opaque twists in their slender stems . As always , we have to beware of imitations . These cheerful little fairground treasures have an appeal which the present-day glassblowers can satisfy . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or watch-balls , once credited with supernatural powers and sometimes intended for jug-covers to keep out dust and insects . Handbells are copied , too . The French factories make good reproductions , but the Bohemian modern copies are unlikely to deceive the expert . Remember that although glass hats and similar novelties were being made by the Americans as late as 1900 , they were all far more elaborate than anything created by our own glassblowers in the early nineteenth century . Surely the loveliest of all friggers still available to the collector is the spun glass fountain complete with bright flowers and red and blue crested birds . Another variation of it is the elegant sailing ship with delicate rigging , up which lively sailors are climbing . Sometimes an opaque glass lighthouse stands by the ship , or a smaller boat tosses on the spun glass seas . There is an example of an early nineteenth-century ship in the Victoria and Albert Museum . 67 2 Paperweights In the mid-nineteenth century the English glassblowers were producing cameo paperweights of portraits of contemporary celebrities . The master of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested a visit to the British Museum reading room would be helpful ; there you can see two of his books referring to these cameos and other work : The Origin , Progress and Improvement of Glass Manufacture ( 1821 ) , and Curiosities of Glass-making ( 1849 ) . Most of the portraits were copies of coins or medals , and these were made from a mixture of china clay and super-silicate of potash poured into a mould taken from the coin or medal ; after it was cooled from having been lightly baked , it was embedded in that brilliant clear flint-glass for which our glassblowers are renowned . Sometimes the cameos were on cups of scent-bottles , basins or even decanters or later on flat plaques . A cheap type of cameo appeared at the Great Exhibition of 1851 , incorporating little figures coloured in metallic paint . There were cube weights later , in 1887 , commemorating the Jubilee and these were cameos of the old Queen . A firm called John Ford &; Co. of Edinburgh , produced good cameos in the Pellatt tradition from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones with birds , fruit , flowers and so on were made in England from 1845 following the example of the French , who had begun to make the exquisite examples that fetch such fantastic prices today . Our English work was not so good at first , but George Bacchus and Sons of Birmingham is a // name to remember . They exhibited their " letter-weights " made in a style called Venetian star-work , which was made rather like the ancient Romans made their mosaics . These were shown at the Society of Arts in 1848 and are very rare today . A very attractive weight , sometimes large enough to be a doorstop , is the early Nailsea flower-pot which was also made at Castleford and Birmingham . A delicious silvery pot holds a group of delicate palegreen flowers under a dome of soft green , though sometimes there are just bubbles that look like a little fountain . Experts tell us that the palest green comes from Castleford . There are also millefiore doorporters to be found if you are lucky . Paperweights are , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish factory at Perth and an English one at Wealdstone , which used to be in London at Whitefriars . This last factory produced a paperweight to commemorate our present Queen . At the Scottish factory the weights were made by a Spanish family who settled there about 1915 . These are beautifully made and not intended to deceive the unwary as anything but works of art worthy to continue the long line of successful glassmaking . The Scottish ones sometimes have PY on them and were made by the son , Paul Ysart . Between about 185o and 1890 interesting Victorian views for tourists were made as paperweights . These are cheap now and quite gay and colourful . After 1890 , photographs were used and have little appeal for collectors . 69 3 Victorian Art Glass The repeal of the Glass Act in i 845 meant that our English craftsmen could once more give full rein to their skill in the glassmen 's incomparable art of manipulating our own special flint-glass , which had never been so flawlessly and brilliantly made on the Continent . A variety of exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its most striking attribute being the many and varied colourings : there is Venetian style glass , satin glass , pearlwares in soft shaded colours , crackled , frosted , opalescent , spangled and spattered glass , purple mosaic glass ware , carnival or taffeta glass , and iridescent glass which is perhaps best known in the work of Tiffany . His first designs were stained glass , and he was that rare artist who also worked in metal , so his lamps particularly are sought after , combining as they do so successfully the two materials . Most of this type of glass was produced from about 185o and well into the twentieth century . American glass makers , who were inspired and helped by English designers and workers at a time when they were much in need of reorganization , seem to have been even more prolific in output than our own craftsmen . Americans , indeed , have been collecting these lovely , gay , colourful pieces much longer than ourselves . Glasshouses at Stourbridge , Sunderland , Bristol , Newcastle and innumerable other places made what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French factories continue to make reproductions of milk-white glass called opaline and many other types very well // indeed . Bohemian glass , too , finds its way into antique shops . Go to a reputable dealer , therefore , who will steer you past pitfalls and show you the differences between modern and old glass . But do n't expect to learn in one lesson . Burmese glass , which looks rather like a sunset , is sometimes dull , sometimes shiny and may be decorated with painting or moulded or carry applied decoration . Almost opaque , it came from America to England under the official , patented name of " Queen 's Burmese " . Queen Victoria ordered a tea-set and some vases after being presented with some pieces by the American maker , and consequently Burmese glass became both fashionable and expensive . Collectors look for overlay or cased glass , which is also becoming very expensive . It has a foundation of clear glass , and then first white and afterwards various coloured casings were applied and cut out by the craftsmen , who finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but red , pink , turquoise and apple-green and white are also available , the loveliest of all being in a combination of three colours . Mostly this kind of glass is found in lustre-decorated vases , and the French paperweights with cased glass openings are beautiful , rare and extremely expensive . Less rare and easy on the purse are candy-stripe glass vases and jugs . Descendants of Venetian glass , they are often basket-shaped with handles . Flowers look exquisite in these charming examples of the glassmaker 's skill . Swirl bowls are very pretty too ; they are ribbed often and lined and usually made of satin glass which is exactly the texture of the material and is often lined with a different colour , and also shaded . Thomas Webb of Stourbridge produced a great deal of this . You will find moulded glass vases , jugs , bowls , match holders , scent-bottles , toilet boxes , night-light holders in many designs and made from a wide range of the art glass . Applied decoration in the form of fruit , flowers or even snakes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinched borders . The white and gold Bristol milk white vases are very lovely indeed , edged with a plain , clear colour , usually rose-pink . // Slagware is popular in America and we call it by this name or sometimes " agate " glass . Correctly it should be named " Mosaic glass " and one writer explains that the term " slag " is a popular misconception . She points out that it was not made out of " end-of-the-day " remains at the glassworks , nor out of coal residue . The applied quilling on some of the art-glass , mostly the Venetian style , is an attractive decoration that looks rather like the fin of a fish . It appears a lot on the pretty cranberry glass . The name Mary Gregory is associated with another type of yellow , green , dark-red , amber and dark-blue glass which appeared in the mid-nineteenth century . In Victoriana Violet Wood also helps to clear up mistakes in identifying this glass . The American glassworker Mary Gregory , who was famous for children 's portraits , gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably came from Venetian glass painted with similar figures of children . The term " Mary Gregory glass " covers all this particular style of decoration , some good and some very mediocre . 7z DO-IT-YOURSELF AT HOME 1 Art under Glass Shades The 1851 Exhibition catalogue has an advertisement showing three different shaped shades " for the covering and preservation of clocks , statuettes , wax figures , alabaster and other ornaments and articles of vertu " . The advertiser is the owner of a Wholesale and Retail Glass Shade Warehouse , which shows what a demand there must have been for these dust excluders . Tenniel 's famous illustration of Alice kneeling on the mantelpiece preparatory to going through the looking glass shows two glass shades standing on either side of her . This was in the i 86os . Comfort , snugness and cosiness are words especially associated with the days of Queen Victoria and comfort is surely inseparable from tidiness . The extremely crowded interiors of nineteenth-century homes would certainly have been quite chaotic without order , and the glass shades sheltered and kept in place all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman of the period . Statuettes , clocks , stuffed birds and animals and beautifully arranged butterflies on home-made bushes were all carefully protected by the omnipresent fragile shade . A publication called The Young Ladies ' Treasure Book was a mine of information to help girls increase the clutter on the shelves and tables and whatnots of the average home by " various kinds of fancy work // and small decorative trifles " . All are eagerly snapped up by collectors today , hungry for craftsman 's work instead of the mass-produced wares of the supermarkets . Thanks to the glass shades many lovely examples of what Sir James Laver so aptly calls " good bad art " have been handed down to us in excellent condition . The delicate charms of the glassmaker 's art , the fragile blown-glass birds and ships , would never have survived but for their protective shades . Many a fine automaton figure or mechanically moving scene remains in first-class condition for the same reason . The hey-day for decorations under glass shades is probably about 185o , though the fashion goes back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the most exacting types of work to be covered under a shade was feather-work . Many delicate and enchanting figures and birds were made into pictures and there are splendid bouquets of flowers to be found . As making them was apparently a particularly demanding art requiring the use of a sharp knife , forceps , scissors , curling tongs and glue , together with a good pen and a painting brush , it was not as popular as the easier shellwork or arrangements of ferns , grass and seaweed and therefore does not seem to have continued long into the nineteenth century . Shellwork and waxwork were , of course , considered to be part of every young lady 's education and the shell grotto was in fashion both in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . A cri de coeur comes from a shell worker in a magazine published in 185o : " Where may shells for the construction of grottoes in gardens be purchased ? " The lovely baskets of shell flowers were expensive to make and the best ones are still expensive today . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century was sold at Sotheby 's and was described as " a vase of flowers with painted green and blue paper leaves and the remainder in a large variety of sea shells , the vase faced with coloured stones and with white coral and contained in an ebonized and kingwood circular glazed case with a deeply moulded and parcel-gilt moulding to the front " . Similar little masterpieces can be found imprisoned beneath glass shades and consequently in perfect // condition . The shells were more often dyed than painted and the baskets were sometimes made of open metalwork or of more shells . The wax-flower art was practised by many experts , who no doubt had the same tolerant contempt for the amateurs of the schoolroom and the drawing-room as the artists of any age have for the talented amateur . Well-known professional names include Mrs Strickland , Mrs Temple , who produced notably fine flowers and , of course , Mrs Peachey , who was " Artist in Wax to her Majesty " . There may have been a little jealousy among her fellow artists for her work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax-flower group occupied a prominent position but had somehow managed to relegate Mrs Peachey to a stand on private view only . Her dignified explanation is given in her book The Royal Guide to Wax Flower Modelling : in the original position assigned to her the sun would have melted her flowers , and when she complained it was altered to this unsuitable place . Incidentally , Mrs Peachey mentions Mary of Modena , wife of James II , as having introduced wax modelling into England , which seems surprisingly late when one remembers that the ancient Egyptians were making imitation coloured fruits and carving small figures out of beeswax to accompany them on their last journeys . A particularly collectable group of shades is that of tinted wax groups , sometimes of birds and animals , but mostly of young people , which are carefully modelled in relief and look as if they had first been poured into moulds . The backs are always flat . They are painted and arranged , often with a background of homely trees , and have obviously been specially designed for shades . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while others have had domes thrust upon them . The religious groups are generally in pale creamy wax with no additional colour , which makes them a pleasant foil to the coloured versions in a collection . These religious groups seem to have been found mostly on the Continent , though one collector found them as // far away as Chile . In size they range from about nine inches to dollsize examples about two inches high . A gay little parrot in a tiny shade , a girl with a bicycle and a pair of little children dressed in the romantic revival style of Kate Greenaway 's illustrations are all of them not more than three inches high . Some of the larger ones have arches of gauze dog-roses framing the figures . Many of these are about , and the smallest fit nicely into a dolls ' house . In fact dolls ' house shades were made and deserve mention here , although they are so difficult to find , for few collectors can resist the miniature version of his particular quarry . These tiny copies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small Parian statuettes . Dolls , clocks , musical figures and especially arranged groups of treasures too fragile to be left unprotected can be found dust-free and fresh under their shades . Shades alone and uninhabited cost a lot now , but that probably will not be for ever . Fashions in antiques are capricious and generally it is only things which have intrinsic value , such as silver , gold , precious stones and good furniture and pictures , which keep their value . Nevertheless , shades are very useful to collectors , protecting their precious treasures from dust and idle fingers , and certainly worth buying at a pound or two . Best , of course , to buy them protecting some lovely little piece of careful craftsmanship of a hundred or so years ago . In a scrapbook recently there was a charming series of coloured engravings showing various trades and shops . Judging by their flat slippers , coal-scuttle bonnets and wide skirts , the lady and her daughter looking at the shops date to about 185o . In one engraving they are looking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tooth Powder " and a larger , sinister jar labelled " Leeches " . In the next picture they are looking at a counter of wax flowers under tall glass domes and this engraving is called " Ornamental Industry " . Mother and daughter are obviously interested in what were always referred to in the nineteenth century as " shades " . To be " clever with her fingers " was the aim of every Victorian Miss . Some of the // work under shades was professional , but many more took shape in the schoolroom or parlour . Luckily the Victorians in their large houses were natural hoarders , so we reap the benefit of their industry and artistic efforts today . 77 2 Beadwork The Victorians designed the gayest , most attractive furnishings out of the enormous quantities of brilliantly coloured glass beads which the Venetians exported to us . Cushion covers , foot-stools , tea cosies , even complete surrounds for bed hangings can still be found . Their great advantage is that they can be cleaned with no danger of the colours running . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to our taste ? face-screens , bell-pulls , mantelpiece draperies , even gentlemen 's cravats . Everything that could conceivably be given a case or a box to preserve it had one painstakingly made and as often as not decorated with beads . Most of us are attracted by gay colours , so it 's not surprising that the history of beads goes back a long way into the past . Beads have been used for adornment at least since the Pharaohs , who delighted in beaded collars and armlets . In prehistoric times the first necklaces were made out of teeth or shells and bone and ivory , but in Egypt the earliest ones found by archaeologists were fashioned of stone , and later from a glazed material called steatite . Soon beads were being produced in a glorious assortment of bright colours such as blue and gold , green , amethyst and lapis lazuli . Some of the early Egyptian beads were beautifully carved in the shape of flowers and fruit . In 3500 B.C. the most exquisite beads came from Ur , which is believed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period . They were made out of pearls , lapis , shell , faience and of etched chalcedony and cornelian . The mysteriously lovely onyx cat 's // eye came from Mesopotamia , about z000 B.C. and was considered to be a talisman for preserving the eyesight . Much later , amber beads were worn as a cure for stomach ache , and in Brittany the peasants still cherish certain beads , wearing them round their necks to ward off various ills . In fact , beads were worn in many countries and for that matter still are , more as amulets than ornaments . Superstitions associated with beads are even now very much alive . For instance , glass beads are being manufactured in the East for protection against the Evil Eye , while Iranian coracles still carry two blue beads and two cowrie shells in their rim to fend off misfortune . In Athens you may quite likely find that your Greek taxi driver has hung two blue beads by his speedometer for the safety of himself and his passengers . In Elizabethan days beads were particularly favoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver thread . The ornateness of dress was largely due to the passion for finery of Henry VIII , which he passed on to his daughter Elizabeth I. At her death they counted in her wardrobe glittering bejewelled dresses by the thousand , not to mention wigs by the hundred . She bought the splendid collection of pearls which Mary Queen of Scots had acquired when she lived in France , and judging by her portraits , pearl beads were Elizabeth 's pride and joy . In France , at the same time , the covering of dresses with costly beads had become even more exaggerated . Henry IV , himself noted for his austere clothes , provided his mistress , Gabrielle d'Estree , with a dress so heavy with pearl beads and other precious stones that the poor lady was incapable of standing upright in it without help . It is something of a relief to come to the early nineteenth century , when , after a few ups and downs , the popularity of beads revived but did not get out of hand . This is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made in delicate flower designs , composed of tiny coloured beads . You can find , for example , necklaces , brooches and hair ornaments made out of beads threaded on to // gossamer-fine waxed thread by means of needles of a delicacy the modern age never sees . One of the most easily found pieces of beadwork is the purse , and more particularly the " miser 's purse " , which opens into a slit for the coins to be dropped in and is then kept safely in place by rings of steel or gilt . The colour and variety of these charming purses make the loveliest collection , and a good example hung on the wall beneath a picture looks most decorative . The Harris Museum at Preston has a large collection of purses and anyone lucky enough to live within motoring distance should make a point of going there , not only for the beadwork but for many other interesting sidelines of Victoriana . By 183o the flowery designs had superseded the geometric patterns of the Regency . The Victorians loved roses and many charming examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a small collection of nothing but roses or flowered beadwork . The repeal of the Glass Tax in 1845 meant that beads were cheaper , since they could be made in our own glassworks instead of being imported from Venice . Even loomed beadwork was made , which can be distinguished from the handmade work by its absolute uniformity . Dating beads is rather a problem , but as a general guide amber , rose , turquoise-blue and green are the earliest that concern us . Crimson , dark-greens and greys date to about 1880 . In the Musee des Arts Decoratifs , in Paris , you can see examples of French beadwork . There are eighteenth-century covers for scent bottles and for scissor shields ; there are handles on knives and forks made out of beads , and bead-covered boxes of all sizes and shapes . In the seventeenth century , too , they made use of beads for decoration . There were elegant book covers , watch cases and needle cases , most of them in those soft greens and golds we associate with Stuart " stump-work " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenirs with messages in beadwork saying Le coeur a vous , or Je suis sincere , and in this delightful museum there is an enormous pipe case of pure Victorian vintage decorated in the early sky-blue beads . 8o BEADWORK As we search for these exquisitely made , brightly coloured treasures , it is amusing to reflect that trade beads are still being used for sale and barter among primitive tribes today . It seems that beads , like toys , have a universal appeal . // , adies ' Magazines and Fashion Plates ie of the best sources to go to once the search for Victoriana benes a study as well as a hobby is the magazine of the period . The glishwoman 's Domestic Magazine , founded in 18 52 , is only one of many : h reference books . It serialized Mrs Beeton 's Household Management . n the volume for 1855 there is an article called " Potichomanie " which we find that " the latest and most fashionable introduction the ladies ' work table is the art of converting plain glass vases into ne quaint-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation of the most beautiful modern vases . " Sheets of coloured signs were cut out and gummed inside the plain glass vase and gummed again on top , after which a coat or two of coloured paint s added followed by a coat of varnish to preserve it . The result Inds disastrous , but it may have been attractive in 185 5 . Few can have survived the years , however , nor does this seem particularly sad . Drily goes to show that there were many useless objects made , of all value artistically , and points the moral that collectors have to selective . Other articles give instructions on lace-making , beadwork , braid ; , crochet , embroidery , netting and numbers of recipes , some of which are very good indeed . There is a section on " Sick-room andnursery " which is rather startling . We find , for instance , instructions Jut curing " Cholera and Autumnal Complaints " . But , of course , cholera was a Victorian scourge and there were several terrible tbreaks. 8a LADIES ' MAGAZINES AND FASHION PLATES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver lace . The instructions are very simple : " Sew the lace in a clean linen cloth , boil it in a quart of soft water and a quarter of a pound of soap and wash it in cold water . If tarnished , apply a little warm spirits of wine to the tarnished parts . " A hint on how to clean papier-mache is another helpful piece of information for collectors of that delightful ware . All we have to do is to wash it with a sponge and cold water ( no soap ) , dredge while damp with flour and then polish with a piece of flannel . The way to bleach engravings is a little more complicated for the print has to be immersed in " oxygenated muriatic acid " . This has to be obtained from a chemist and the strength of the acid can be tested by using a leaf of an old book .

Besides biographies of the Bonapartes and Miss Nightingale there are stories ranging from " Miami , an Indian Legend " to " Domestic Trials " and articles on birds , costumes of the world , the employment of women , fairy tales , prize compositions , poetry and a coy monthly contribution called " Cupid 's Letterbag " . Florence , for instance , asks anxiously , " When a gentleman asks you , can he be more than a friend ? ' what are you to infer , and what would be proper to answer ? " The replies are sharply commonsensical : " Alma has already behaved very indiscreetly and had better beat a rapid and decisive retreat . " Or even more peremptorily , " Sarah is a wicked person .

The Gallery of Fashion came out as early as the 17905 and so did the first issue of the popular Ladies ' Monthly Magazine , and there are others with French titles and fashion plates which nevertheless were published in London . // The fashion plates themselves are well worth collecting and the best period is from about 184o to 187o when not single fashions are shown but delightful family groups of mother and daughters or friends meeting in the park or on the croquet lawn , at the seaside or sometimes watching sports or dancing in a ballroom . These delightful plates thus give us an idea of how life was lived in those days , though of course they are catering only for the upper-classes . There are a few names to remember , for those who like to search only for the cream , but the signatures are elusive , so look hard at the corners of the plates or you may miss them . Three sisters called Heloise Leloir , Anais Toudouze and Laure Noel , daughters of Alexandre Marie Colin , were some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for F. C. Compte-Calix and Janet Lange Ind an apparently unidentified person who used the nom-de-plume of Numa . After 1870 the magazines lost their valuable supply of fashion Slates from France on account of the Franco-Prussian War . When France was on her feet again the flow started once more , but after 900 the fashion plate degenerated into mass production and this , the : nd of the Victorian period , is where we lose interest in them . 84 4 Pastimes for Leisured Ladies In 1851 a magazine called The Family Friend published a long article devoted to the arts of " modelling in cork , gutta percha , leather , paper , plaster of Paris , wax , wood etc . " . Leisured ladies and the younger ones instructed by their governesses had a great deal of time to produce so patiently and painstakingly these " cities-ancient " from cork in bas-relief or " cities-modern " from cardboard . Cork pictures can be found quite easily , and even a whole house , like a chalet with a doll of 1830 on the balcony , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This funny little piece must have been made about 184o , and behind the facade of the house trees of seaweed were stuck against a sky carefully hand-painted blue with some fleeting white clouds . An inch or two of path , bordered by cowrie shells , leads up to the front door , while a beautifully cut-out fence has two birds sitting on it and a pair of cats made out of snailshells sit cosily by the front-door . There were many such framed scenes a little while ago , and another one , a good deal later , has a certain charm , too : this rather larger scene has a tiny house with a tennis court in front of it and inch-high " Dutch " dolls are playing a foursome . The whole thing appeared to be made out of a material resembling marzipan . Could it have been some late Victorian or Edwardian tennis-club celebration ? The glass that keeps it fresh and undamaged prevents a more comprehensive study . The Family Friend 's correspondence columns were full of queries . A modeller in wax asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waxen fruits be purchased at the cheapest rate ? " On mother page a correspondent mentions the Great Exhibition and rives a list of Waxen Flower Makers ' names . There are Emma Chisholme , Jeanette Devis , Henrietta Ewart and many others , not Forgetting perhaps the most famous of them all , Emma Peachey , already mentioned . Although many shell arrangements were displayed under glass hades , a number were also designed as pictures to be framed and lung on the crowded walls of the Victorian drawing-room , and earlier on the less cluttered Georgian walls . Another novelty was a variation of the " tinsel " picture , which consisted of dressing the figures of a print with materials and pieces ) f hair and jewellery and other oddments . This light-hearted pastime was also practised in France and I have een a pair of pictures of an actor and an actress believed to be eighteenth-century work . Two scenes of a river picnic embellished n this way , where the figures are in eighteenth-century clothes , hang n the Musee des Arts Decoratifs , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-known " tinsel " pictures ? much copied nowadays as a trap for beginners . The Prince Regent 's passion for heatricals made them especially popular in his day , though in fact hey were being made at least as early as Garrick . The toy-theatre heets date back to about 1811 and the characters and scenes were on ale for what has now become a household phrase ? " a penny plain ; wopence coloured " . The early portraits were intended for the amusenent of adults , who bought their favourite artistes either already embellished or to which they added the material and tinsel themselves . Albums are preserved in the British Museum of the work of a alented invalid , Amelia Blackburn . She invented her paper cut-outs n the 1830s , making them out of ordinary kitchen paper , fixing the yin-pricked pieces with gum and painting them . Her work was in the radition of Mrs Delany 's famous " mosaicks " , an album of whose work is also in the British Museum . This delightful friend of the duchess of Portland , herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of fairylike cut-outs of paper flowers . In 1774 , when she invented this art , she was 74 years old . Fanny Burney describes in her diary the methods the Duchess used in her botanically faultless reproductions of flowers . Paper cut-outs were much in fashion during the early nineteenth century and charming examples can be found quite easily . Rolled paper-work pictures , straw-work , bead-work portraits and other subjects , hair-work landscapes , skeleton-leaf pictures , shells , feathers and seaweeds made into flowers or landscapes were all used in the popular pastimes of the period . Many have their origins a great deal earlier , of course . The scope for the collector is considerable , but he needs , as always , to be selective . In all forms of collecting this is a golden rule which can not be reiterated too often . Quality and not quantity is to be strongly urged , and the amateur collector should beware of paying too much for damaged or second-rate goods . Painting on velvet or velours was another art of the nineteenth century . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , described as " with sprays of summer flowers on an ivory ground in maplewood frames " , fetched ? 34 . The same catalogue listed a pair of mid-eighteenth-century Italian cut-paper and material religious pictures , which were probably made by nuns since they are known to have specialized in rolled paper-work . The pictures realized ? I05 . However , a Victorian painting on velours of George Washington cost only ? 18 and another of the Prince of Wales , later Edward VII , went for L16 . I have been unable to discover why velvet paintings were sometimes referred to as " theorem paintings " . Perhaps the most interesting of all these unusual mediums for pictures was the most professional one . " Marmotinto " is the impressive term for painting in sand and marble dust , which was popular for only a short time during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , though its origins go far into the past . We know comparatively little about it , except that of the few artists who tried their hand at it even fewer signed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both admirers of this strange form of // ainting and the Duke of York possessed a fine collection which was ) ld after he died in 1827 . The three artists specially remembered for their sand paintings re Zobel , who came to England in 1783 , a confectioner called Haas ad another German named Schweikhardt . Both Haas and Zobel aimed to have invented the art , though primitive people used to lake sand-patterned floors and the Japanese produced their celerated " tray pictures " of small landscapes in coloured sand , which they had designed for many centuries . The discovery made by Haas ad Zobel was a method of preserving these pictures for posterity . Haas , who seems to have been a most accomplished " table-decker " , stressed his Royal patron , George III , when he had to destroy a articularly fine decoration to a dinner table . " Haas , Haas ! " cried is Majesty , " You ought to fix it ! " He certainly took the King 's advice , for by 1789 he had experimented so successfully in fixing sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling . His method was to put different coloured sands into small paper bags , which as he would have used for his confectionery icing , and sprinkle the sand through the opening in the end of the bag over a board ) vered with a special cement . A description of his method was given by Queen Charlotte 's lady-in-waiting , Mrs Papendieck . It certain does n't sound an easy way to decorate a ceiling , even if the cards were made on the ground , but we can not judge his success saw as the famous ceiling was destroyed when George IV pulled Dwn the Queen 's Lodge . Schweikhardt , who studied in Holland , used brushwork in his technique but connoisseurs consider that this spoils the effect of sand tinting . Zobel , who also claimed to be the first discoverer of how to K sand , was the most accomplished artist . He produced a great many pictures , some of which were copied from the works of other artists , including Stubbs , West and his great friend Morland , who was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with his sands and marble dust . The poor relations of these professional pictures in sand were the // small pictures made out of the many-coloured sands of the Isle of Wight from the end of the eighteenth century till fairly late in the Victorian age . They were usually about the size of a post-card and were either souvenirs or constituted parlour pastimes for young ladies . There were instructions on how to make these little pictures in many contemporary magazines . They were very simple in comparison with the masterpieces of Haas and Zobel , and they made no use of shading . In fact , the art of marmotinto was not meant for the amateur to practise , but was a serious experiment in a new medium with a matt surface which , it was thought , made it superior in some ways to oil paintings as it could be looked at from all angles . In 1831 an exhibition in Soho Square of Mrs Dickson 's pictures , which were copies of oil paintings made in what we are accustomed to call collage , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft she is said to be the originator , at Brighton under " Royal patronage " . They were more elaborately constructed than tinsel pictures , as the fabric , consisting of tailors ' cuttings , was overlaid one piece on top of another so that the surface of the painting was uneven . Like Zobel she copied other artists ' work , though hers were taken from Old Masters rather than contemporaries . The Victoria and Albert Museum possesses examples of her work . Hairwork , another rather odd invention , is fairly easily found , but may well be mistaken for penwork . The hair of relatives and friends was woven into a landscape or portrait with the same mournful intention as the mourning rings of the same period . Eighteenthcentury ladies were particularly adept at these sad mementoes , which usually showed a sorrowing relative standing by a large urn or mausoleum . This exacting craft must have been hard on the eyes , the fine hair lines being as delicate as cobwebs . During the 1860s there was a vogue for decorating with ferns . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with fern designs , and very attractive they are . There are little boxes and trays painted with ferns too . The industrious ladies with so much spare time on their clever hands embellished notebooks , // Ale-cases and other objects with designs of ferns , and of course the ns grown in every conservatory in profusion and in great variety re there to be used as models very conveniently . shell decoration was another accomplishment which occupied our ies of leisure , and boxes of all sizes and dimensions , some with little ws on the lids , some for gloves , for ribbons or handkerchiefs l others which were for display on the parlour tables must have n made mostly by the children for gifts to enraptured parents and laves at Christmas . There are some of these shell-boxes which I pect were more commercial and perhaps made by cottagers for at seaside resorts for tourists . The early Victorian decorations , especially the beautiful shell flowers , are more sophisticated . Early in century shells were also in favour and the Victoria and Albert museum has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are museums here and abroad ich show how frequently shells have been pressed into service for : oration all through history . The use of shells for artificial flowers the nineteenth century is roughly between 184o and 1865 . They re used with paper and gauze , wool , wax or feathers . Long before : toria 's reign in 1704 shellwork was being advertised as an occupaa that could be taught to children or their elders . Mrs Delany , sous for her interior decorating and varied handicrafts , was writing her many friends about the shell grottoes and the shell flowers for nosegays she was making . She also undertook such enormous work chimney pieces as well as the famous grottoes , and mirror frames , aging shelves and so forth . The early Victorian shellwork about to made use of tiny shells and these , incorporated into baskets and n little dolls dressed up in shell costumes , were known as " rice shellwork " . Rice , in fact , was also used , together with minute beads , clothe the pegwooden dolls . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy . The sad thing about these little works of art is that they are fragile and moult their microscopic beads , rice and shells at the slightest jolt . They are very hard to mend well . Otagonal shell plaques in frames of rosewood , sometimes single , // sometimes double , are not the work of Victorian ladies but come under the heading of sailors ' Valentines ( q.v . ) . Besides all these arts the Victorian ladies made scrapwork screens of many different scraps . Some of them are of quite notable historic interest . For example , there is a scrapwork screen in the Carlyle Museum in London which was made by Jane Welsh Carlyle . Scrapbooks , too , are full of period charm , but often these have been fabricated recently out of a collection of old scraps . Queen Victoria herself encouraged these artistic efforts and Prince Albert bought a picture of rare seaweeds from a lady practising screenwork , so that his children might try to produce such little masterpieces when they were staying at Osborne . Prince Albert was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip by ; he liked all games to be a means of learning something useful . These are some of the innumerable little pieces of charming homemade art to be found under our heading of pastimes for Victorian ladies . // EAS UR . H : S 3400ts and Shoes ! sere seems no end to the odd things people like to collect , but the perstitions linked with shoes date very far back in history and for is reason , perhaps , looking for boots and shoes made from wood , ass , china , silver , pewter , brass or even slate is very popular day . Luck was associated with shoes , in the same way as it was believed that to hang up a horse-shoe brought good fortune , provi:d it was hung the right way up , of course , so that the ends faced ) wards . People used to believe that it brought misfortune to put on the : t shoe first . Shoes are still thrown at the departing bride and brideoom to bring them luck , and when we tie an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , though how many of us realize that the shoe an old fertility symbol ? The history of footwear in all its infinite variety leads to any number of fascinating byways of history and that surely is one of the ys of collecting . There is a never-failing enjoyment to be had from king about in all sorts of shops , from the finest antique dealers , ho sometimes have oddments that came to them in a " lot " at a sale and which they sell off cheaply , to the junk-stall at a weekly market . The boots and shoes we collect are mostly not-for-wearing . The // nineteenth-century love-tokens are the kind of thing we are after , and what a delightful variety of these there are . Glass boots and shoes were made for use as vases , wedding-cake decorations or for toasting the huntsmen . China and pottery shoes and slippers , sometimes single and sometimes joined together , are to be found doing duty as pincushions , stuffed with a velvet bag , or to keep pins and oddments on a Victorian dressing-table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a posy-holder in the lapel of , perhaps , a bridegroom , or his best man . A small Moorish-style slipper an inch long opened to show an assortment of gilt pins , and to judge by its ring at the back of the slipper it probably hung on a nineteenth-century chatelaine . Needlecases were often made in the shape of slippers , sometimes silk-covered with embroidery , sometimes made of cardboard covered with beads . Legs , with or without shoes , were favourites with tobacco addicts , either for matchboxes , like the fat metal Victorian leg , covered with leather and trimmed with silver or brass , which can be found occasionally , with the foot encased in a small , elegant little shoe with a tiny heel . Matchbox legs , by the way , were for use with the short wax vestas matches , which could be struck on the serrated sole of the foot or any other rough surface at hand . Legs and arms were made for tamping the pipe-smoker 's tobacco , though sometimes they were intended for use as seals for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dab of wax impressed with a design or his family crest or even a love-message . Pewter shoes were generally snuff boxes and are quite rare . The brass shoes , with a fixture to hold them upright , were probably used in the bespoke bootmaker 's window to advertise the different styles he could make . There are charming papier-mache shoes , ivory shoes , silver and horn ones , but the greatest variety is probably in wood . The delightful little wooden shoes with their sliding lids and brassstudded soles and " uppers " are said to have been the work of the shoemaker 's apprentices at the end of their day 's work . They were // probabably given to sweethearts or wives as presents and often have a art or other decorations outlined in brass studs . Occasionally they have a date . They were also intended for use as snuffboxes and the is generally fit neatly and well . Some are dated . The Peterborough Museum has an interesting collection of shoes : the snuff box is dated 176o and another is a domino-box . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One collector was the cky finder of a pair of eighteenth-century French shoes which contained over thirty tiny dominoes made of bone . Horn snuff boxes are sometimes made in the shape of footwear , ten dating earlier than the nineteenth century . There are little ones , r the pocket and big , beautifully polished ones for use on the diningble . Some of them are elaborately inlaid with bone or ivory or other-of-pearl . Besides being used for snuff , some shoes were made ashtrays or tea-caddies or travelling ink-wells . A recent find was a nail grey shoe with laces made out of slate . This was an ink-well and label tied on it carried a copperplate written inscription which read , lade by the poor people of Llanberis from the slate quarries at the et of Snowden " sic . Probably not more than a hundred years old , is an interesting little piece of history and could lead to more scoveries if anyone going to Llanberis were inspired to find out something of the conditions in the Victorian slate mines . Many elegant shoe styles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most European countries have miniature shoes or clogs asquerading as pincushions , flasks , love-tokens , bookmarkers and her temptations for the tourists of the past . Dating your finds should not , of course , be done entirely with ference to style . The Victorians tended to make theirs in earlier Ltterns . The cheaper , tourist and fairing types , are almost all neteenth-century work , and some even early twentieth century . Wooden snuffbox shoes date from about i 800 onwards . Sometimes Tunbridge ware boots can be found and make a happy addition to any collection . China shoes and slippers encrusted with pretty moulded pink and // white and blue flowers are usually Continental " bazaar goods " . They should not be compared of course with the exquisite flower-encrusted soft paste porcelain from Bow , Chelsea and other factories in the eighteenth century and later , about 182o , copied by Worcester , Derby , Rockingham , Coalport and other of our factories in bone china . This development of bone china was introduced by Spode in the i 790S and named by Josiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , the humble little shoes and vases for the poor man 's market have considerable charm . Pressed glass shoes , sometimes plain with perhaps a flat bow decorating the toe and sometimes a bright blue , and also the delightful puss-in-a-shoe ornament , were made by Sowerby 's and can be found with that firm 's crest mark of a peacock 's head , dating to about 1876 to 1880 . Another American shoe that sometimes appears in the smaller shops is a nineteenth-century trade advertisement paperweight made of iron or bronze or other materials . For instance , a very elegant boot with a frilled top and a square toe stands on an oblong plinth to advertise a shoe company . Spirit flasks in the shape of shoes and other unexpected shapes appeared in large numbers at the beginning of the nineteenth century made of stoneware . There are other shoes made from a dark-brown treacly ware often ascribed to Rockingham , which were called " hotwater comforters " and these , says tradition , were intended to be put in a real boot , filled with hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but many of these shoe flasks were never meant even to be carried in the pocket . They were simply used to advertise the spirits inside them , and naturally the corks have long since disintegrated . However , a strange-looking boot vase , resembling a white sock which has been petrified , just conceivably may have been used to warm shoes . Before leaving boots and shoes , there is a glass boot worth searching for which was used as a stirrup-cup by huntsmen to fortify them before the chase or restore them afterwards . The jug which accompanies these amusing glasses is in the shape of a hound and the // refreshing drink is poured out of its mouth ; its curled tail is the handle . The boot stirrup-cup can not be put down full , as it is n't designed to be used at table but to be handed up to the rider . Some of these boots are coloured , but usually they are in clear glass . 96 2 Found on the Writing Table Ideally , collecting is purely for pleasure , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find something small to collect there is no serious problem and one of the best fields is the many different little objects associated with the ubiquitous writing table or desk . The history of the subject is quite an amusing source of research when you consider that the first printed book is believed to be the Diamond Sutra , a Chinese prayer book printed in A.D. 868 . In Europe we had to wait a little longer . The first known printing press with movable type did not reach us until about 1450 , and Caxton printed the first book in English in 1476 . Before this , and for that matter a long while after , all books and documents and letters to friends or on business were written by hand , and the quill was the standard pen . From the seventh century until the beginning of the nineteenth century , the quill or goose feather was used and still is to this day , for fine hand-lettering of scrolls and other manuscripts . The Romans used bronze pens . One was found at Pompeii . Roman Emperors made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfading inks of the past was something like our present day Indian ink . Pencils , as we know them , were produced after the discovery of a graphite mine in Cumberland in about 1600 . Wooden pencils were filled with graphite or black lead . The formula has changed little since its invention . Collectable pencils in Tunbridge ware can sometimes be found . Blotting-paper is older than you might think , since it dates back to // VICTORIANA the fifteenth century . In those days , however , it was a rarity . The early paper was so absorbent that no drying was necessary , but Lazed paper , which was not discovered till the late eighteenth cwntury , made sand or blotting-paper essential . As for india rubber , though it did not reach us in England until the eighteenth century , is as old as Christopher Columbus , who discovered its properties ' hen exploring South America . What a far cry that is from the fountain pen , invented in 1886. his surely began the decline of the inkstand and its attractive accessories with which we collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then an undergraduate at ) xford , wrote in his Diary , " Had of Mr Prince , the Bookseller in Lew College Lane , a standish with Sand , Ink , Wafers and half a undreds of Pens . " Fifty or sixty years later a nineteenth-century =citing table required steel nibs , at five shillings apiece at first ; penpipers , often home-made ; string-boxes ; all sorts of attractive paperLips and weights , and of course ink-stands or standishes of varying ze and expense . Silver ones were complete with pounce pot and a andbell for summoning the footman who would carry the letters their destination . Elegant porcelain examples are numerous and also those in papierwache , sometimes with small drawers beneath the inkwells . There are dd inkwells , too , made in the shape of a head . These last were often erman fairings , and you may find Napoleon , a bonneted housewife and many other odd characters made in the characteristic German and-paste porcelain of the period . They usually have a distinctly ) ickensian flavour . As with pin-boxes and matchboxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Conta and Boehme , with its arm olding a pointed dagger in a shield with convex sides , can somemes be found . Remember that after 1891 the words " Made in ermany " , or for that matter , any other country , will be added to the mark . This was a rule of an American Tariff Act demanding that 11 imported wares should bear the name of the country in which they sere made . // Two Staffordshire inkwells in the Victoria and Albert Museum show amusing caricature faces . One is of Elizabeth , wife of Job Ridgway , potter of Shelton . She died in 1810 . The mark is an incised N and it is dated c. i 810 . The other is of a man and is c. 1840 . A beautiful Derby inkstand of about the same period , 1810-1830 , is in porcelain , shaped like a basket with urns for ink inside it . The flowers are coloured in browns , purples , yellows and reds with gilding . This is , of course , a forerunner of Victoriana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brought up to date . Another treasure in the same museum is a mid-eighteenth-century writing-box in enamel , with two glass bottles , nibs , a metal penholder and a tablet and seal . There are beautiful examples of seals on exhibition and it can not be too often emphasized how important it is for collectors to go to our museums and see the best examples of whatever they have decided to collect . The Victoria and Albert , so vast in its scope , is a particularly happy hunting ground for knowledge . One of the most collectable inkpots is of iridescent glass and mounted on feet like captive soap-bubbles . Sometimes it 's a rich cobalt blue but usually they are simply plain iridescent glass . Brass paperclips are also desirable and here again you will find great variety and ingenuity . Hands , birds ' heads , dogs ' heads , boars ' heads and other amusing shapes are to be found . These sometimes bear the diamond mark , which will date them for you exactly . Penwipers , too , are in a diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coloured felt with decorative beads sewn on their dresses and their petticoats of muslin for cleaning pens , to the boar 's head of brass with a brush on its neck for the use of your inkstained nib . A delightful little book published in 1863 gives a glimpse of what the children 's lives were in that period . It is called The Girls ' Own Toymaker and one chapter is devoted to penwipers . The butterfly penwiper is made of black velvet , buttonhole stitched all round the outside of the wings in yellow sewing silk , the inner // markings chain-stitched and the wings with red silk stitching and small beads to decorate it . The witch penwiper necessitates procuring " a brown wax doll , with an old woman 's face " . Like the earlier pegwooden , her petticoats serve as a penwiper . She wears , like a pedlar doll , a red cape and the instructions end " Quill up some narrow lace for a cap and make a large bonnet of black satin with a high oldfashioned crown " . No pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have a small basket lined with pink calico and filled up with small pin-cushions , etc. , and a small twig for a stick . That would have taken several happy days ' work for the girls , and no doubt decorated Papa 's writing desk very pleasingly . A doll , c. 186o , dressed as a sweep , is a good idea for a penwiper too . Paperclips were a popular addition to any well-furnished writing table and here again there is a splendid variety for the collector . The hands of different sizes are generally in brass and not only can they be hung up beside your table to accommodate sheets of paper or outstanding bills but they generally have a diamond mark to date them . There are brass birds ' heads in which the beak can clasp your letters , some very beautifully tooled and with coloured glass eyes . The greyhound will hold your papers in his brass mouth and of course there are many heavy brass , marble or glass paperweights . These last are probably the loveliest and most sought-after writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baccarat , Clichy and St Louis fetch enormous prices today . The delicate flowers , fruit and millefiori patterns are irresistible to most of us , lying under their plain or faceted domes of clear translucent white glass . Even in 1963 a rare salamander weight was sold for L3,900 . These factories made exquisite inkwells , too , and so did our own factories at Stourbridge , for example . These are very special writing table ornaments and deserve a book to themselves . Indeed much has been written on the subject and one should read about them as well as study them carefully before buying . They can still be found at prices less formidable than the salamander , but there are many copies . In fact , modern glass factories are producing beautiful I00 FOUND ON THE WRITING TABLE ones fairly described as modern , and maybe some of them will be collectors ' pieces of the future . To return to our table , you might find an odd little pair of brass scissors with round ends like small coins . These are wafer-tongs , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seal their less important letters . Documents and business letters would be sealed with wax and stamped by one of the attractive seals on a ring with or without a handle . These seals have a very long history behind them , going back at least as far as ancient Egypt . Many people collect seals in their own right and it is possible to make a most interesting collection , both valuable and beautiful to look at . You can find seals made from hardstone and sometimes mounted on a handle with several seals on a wheel , so that the writer may choose a different motto according to his mood or to suit his different correspondents . These are reputed to have been much used in France in the nineteenth century and often have both English and French devices on them . For instance , I have one with seven seals . One has " Bonsoir " with a candle on a blue stone ; a yellow stone is engraved with a bird escaping from a cage and bears the inscription " If you neglect me you lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " . ntourdi mais constant " written beneath it . A word of warning , however : Do n't use these seals on hard modern sealing wax or they will be ruined , as old wax was made of softer materials . Tunbridge ware shows a most delightful assortment of useful little boxes for your desk . There are stamp boxes of different sizes , many with Queen Victoria 's head when young on the lid in the form of a stamp , carefully built up from innumerable tiny squares of wood . There are rulers and letter-racks , string-boxes and blotters . The string-boxes in particular have many forms , in the way that Victorians made all their everyday objects things of charm , if not always of beauty . There are string-boxes shaped like beehives , standing on small , round feet and barrels , fruit or animal shapes as well . Pounce pots come in a number of shapes and sizes , sometimes incorporated into the inkstand and sometimes alone in their own IOI VICTORIANA right . The word pounce simply means that the lid was perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The powder originally used , meant to re-surface the rough paper , was made from a concoction of gum sandarac or sometimes from powdered cuttle-fish beaks . As we have seen , the early paper was very absorbent . It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that a fine black sand was put into the pounce pot to dry the ink , for by then a glazed paper was being made . Paper knives are also varied and attractive pieces . A Regency ram 's head carved at the top of a flat piece of rosewood might have rubbed shoulders with later examples with penwork flowers curling up the length of the knife , and at the end of the century we find that the decay in writing has brought the paper knife or letter-opener to half its size . A small owl decorates the top of a little paper knife only three and a half inches long . In the Salisbury Museum there is quite a collection of amusing writing things . A lead inkwell of the eighteenth century stands beside a notepaper box in Tunbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ware , seal and pounce box . There is an early nineteenthcentury quill pen-cutter and an instrument like a pair of pincers to extract rusty nibs from the penholder . Seals in their boxes are displayed , together with wafers , also in original boxes , and a braided home-made penwiper decorated with the allied flags and " Crimea 1854 " . There is also a usefully combined scissors and paper knife . Nor should we forget the lovely papier-niche accessories which , apart from porcelain and beautiful silver , are the most desirable of all , writing-paper boxes , blotters , pen trays and inkwells . There is a curious charm , too , in the art nouveau pen trays of pewter , with a high silver content . Their originality grows on a collector . These delightful trivia of everyday life were made in all kinds of different materials . Among them there must be something for everybody . IO2 3 Lighting the Home The difficulty with candles was that the flame is never constant . The slightest draught and the wax spilled over the candlestick and the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to manage and must have been quite a hazard when everyone had bed hangings and no other lights available . Candle-guards helped , of course . Oil-lamps , even with chimneys and globes , were not ideal , but at least the flame was more or less constant and they were generally made with heavy brass or metal bases , so that they could not overturn easily . Collectors of different styles of illumination in the nineteenth century have the same enormous choice that this period offers in so many other collectable objects . Candlesticks alone are to be found in porcelain and pottery , in glass , pewter , wood and brass , as well as in Sheffield plate and silver . The Victorians used an oil made of colza , carcel or rape-seed which came from the crushed seeds of kale or other brassica and was cheap and reasonably clear and smokeless . Carcel lamps date from about 1798 until late in the nineteenth century and many charmingly designed lamps used this oil . The earliest ones had no glass chimney , but the inventor , Aime Argand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fed by a flat woven cotton wick , were expensive to run because they used so much oil . However , this too was remedied by experiment with clockwork-driven pumps and later spring pressure . Student lamps , with green shades to reduce the glare , were made // with an original type of reservoir on the principle of the " bird fountain feed " . Although these were rather cumbersome , they were , in 183o , a great improvement on previous lighting . The duplex burner appeared in 1865 and only at the end of the century did paraffin become available on a commercial scale . The lamps with Argand burners were designed to fit neatly into pottery or china bases . In the early 1800s the new gas lighting was tried out in some factories and in 1807 Pall Mall was triumphantly lit up with this satisfactory , if noisy illumination . By about 184o gas lighting was used in the home quite widely , popping and singing in an alarming way , which we should certainly not tolerate today . Frosted glass globes enclosed the jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fittings were fixed on the walls , with balloon-like shades over the gas flame . Even the kitchens boasted a chandelier . They were extremely ornate and elaborate and so were the wall lamp fixtures . They still looked rather like oil lamps , which had also been made for standing on tables and to hang or to be attached on to the wall . One comfort was that with gas there was no need to place a tray or plate beneath the lamp to collect the dripping colza oil . Candle lamps were still in use and chamber candlesticks were kept in bedrooms . In fact , between about 186o and 1914 ' there were four different ways of lighting the home . You could have candles , oil , gas or electricity . Often only the ground floor of a house was lit by gas and the rooms upstairs had to make do with candles and oil . In the 189os a form of light decoration which was very fashionable was a metal circle about a foot or so in diameter suspended from a central pendant from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to taste . Brass , pewter , silver , china and even wood were used for candlesticks and candelabra stands , and mirror piano brackets as well . Electric lighting had been available in the mid-nineteenth century , but for home lighting it was not in use until the carbon-filament lamp had been invented . In fact , it was not in common use until // after 1914 , being so costly to install . Really there was little difference in appearance between gas fittings and those for electric light in Victorian and Edwardian days . About 1900 the American , Louis Comfort Tiffany , produced some remarkable " Pond Lily " lamps signed " Tiffany Studios " . His shades were very popular , too , as were his elegant bronze candlesticks . They are in complete contrast , of course , to their late Victorian counterparts : the Victorian brass standard lamp , for example , had a yellow marble shelf half way up and a brass surround , presumably for ashtrays and matches . Tiffany and other art nouveau designers were in revolt against just this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tasteful to our standards of simpler design . Hand-painted china ones were made by Worcester and Minton and Derby and , particularly in the Minton examples , they were en suite with toilet-sets for the dressingtable . There are various lamps of the late nineteenth century which were copies of the old models . Argand lamps were the earliest , being copies of the original French models , and these were made between about 1820 and 185o . They have arms sticking out carrying burners and come in sets of three for standing on the mantelpiece . The so-called Princess lamps are very pretty with the oil-well and the shade in matching glass of various colours in the different popular forms of " art glass " . Sometimes the glass is cut or moulded . This is the period , between about 1820 ( or in our case 1837 , since we are discussing Victoriana ) and the 1870s , that we find the best lamps . You will see bright blue opaque glass lamps with brass mounts which date round about 1870 . The pink and white spatter glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is another pleasing design . Sometimes a maker 's mark can be found on the brass mounts . Glass nightlights should not be forgotten in this search for illumination . Safety candles were made by Samuel Clarke of London which burnt very slowly . They had a glass or a metal base , topped with a rounded glass shade made from various elaborate forms of // satin glass , Burmese , rose-coloured , striped or swirled glass . Some were enriched with pinched glass decorations . One unusual kind is the nightlight that looks a little like the shape of a lemon-squeezer . It has a stalk at the bottom enabling it to be up-ended and fixed into the top of a candlestick . It was a patented device , also made by Clarke , and the shade was clear glass shaped like a flower . The trade-mark of this and similar nightlights was very appropriately a fairy with a wand and the sentence " Clarke 's patented Cricklite " , while some have the words " Fairy Light " and " Pyramid " on them . These charming nightlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other purposes besides comforters for children or in a dark passage . They could keep food hot , for example . The colours of the shades included all those of the rainbow and a collection of blue , red , yellow , green and turquoise shades can be extremely attractive . The only difficulty is that the metal , china or clear glass bases are often missing . A handsome lighting for dinner-parties in early Victorian days was shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851 . Designed by Archibald Cole for the Whitefriars Glass Works , the important-looking glass stand had four glass burners hung with lustres and must have looked splendid . io6 4 Miniature Furniture In these days of smaller houses or flats the idea of collecting large armoires normandes or enormous tables , bureaux and grandfather clocks may be out of the question , but there are many miniature versions available . First , though , we must distinguish between the different categories we shall come across . The distinction is extremely subtle between furniture meant for children 's toys , for instance , and small furniture made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tour de force . This last can be found in nearly every style and date . Before 1790 English dolls ' houses , or baby-houses as they were then called , were even designed by architects of the stature of Robert Adam , and furniture was made for them by equally professional designers , Chippendale included . Apprentice pieces , made to test the skill of the hand and eye , are notable for brilliant craftsmanship , too , as are travellers ' samples , which are extremely solid . They had to be , to stand up to a lot of handling by prospective customers . Among them you will find wellmade chairs , tables , four-poster and other beds , chests of drawers , bureaux , washstands and many other charming little pieces . It is interesting to know that as late as the 1870s the manufacturers ' agents were taking round miniature samples to the retailers in preference to illustrated catalogues . One can understand why . The sales appeal of these tiny replicas must have been far greater than the humdrum illustrations . Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right " pieces , and the Dolls ' House Museum , called The Rotunda , at Oxford , has a unique display of period houses complete with furniture for every room , including of course necessities of everyday life such as china , glass , kitchenware , books , newspapers , toys in the nurseries and lighting , heating and bathroom accessories , not forgetting all the inhabitants , dressed in period clothes . Miniature furniture of brass is very attractive and except for the nuisance of keeping it clean a collection of tables and chairs , cradles , toilet-glasses , coal buckets , candlesticks and oil lamps , trivets , kettles and grates is a delight . It has been made from the eighteenth century and tourist trade articles are still made today , so beware . The early tables are tipup round tops with three legs , and the oval Victorian tables have heavy , turned legs and not such heavy tops . Here again , a visit to the Bethnal Green Museum will help would-be collectors . The doll-size furniture , too big for the average dolls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pieces , some of the best being cabinetmakers ' samples , or those used in shop-windows to advertise the trade , are beautifully made out of fine wood , and even dolls ' house size examples can be found that show exemplary workmanship in miniature . Chests of drawers , chairs and tables are probably the commonest pieces to find in comparison with rarities like knee-hole desks , bureaux , secretaires ; and even beds and cradles are difficult to come by these days , when small articles are so eagerly snapped up . A dollsize rocking chair and another similar one in beechwood pretending to be bamboo exactly fits two late Victorian dolls . One size larger is another pair made of bentwood with plywood seats , one having " Pet " written on the back in punched holes and the other , the rocker , having " Baby " in the same place . The plywood is firmly fixed with brass buttons and these strong little chairs fit two- or three-year-old children perfectly . This type of chair was introduced in the middle of the nineteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in Victoria 's reign , solid , well-built pieces that have stood up remarkably well to the wear and tear of nursery life . IIO MINIATURE FURNITURE Miniature cast-iron grates are nearly as pretty as brass ones , and sometimes they have matching fire-irons . See if you can find the tiny irons on their ornamental stands . These can be as small as an inchand-a-half long . Nowadays people are more aware of what they may find tucked away in an old suitcase in the loft , or lingering in that old chest-ofdrawers on the landing . But a story was told to me not long ago about a small-scale tragedy involving a collection of such quarter-size chairs , rocking-chairs and other miniature treasures , which had been arranged on shelves in a house for the admiration of anyone who called there . This lovely sample furniture joined all the rubbish on a bonfire in a general clean-up and with it went a small bit of history . We are all the poorer for incidents like this . Luckily most of us collectors are natural hoarders . Before ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece should be added for want of a better place to include it : look for the enchanting little miniature fiddles which were and may still be made by makers of fine violins . These are not to be found every day and do n't confuse them with the objets d'art type made of mother-of-pearl and tortoiseshell . The ones I mean are of expert workmanship , complete replicas of full-sized violins in every respect . They were made , apparently , as practical demonstrations of skill by the experts . The famous violinist , Albert Sammons , was one of the many musicians who collected this particular type of miniature . These wooden violins were very difficult to make , partly owing to the rarity of wood with such a diminutive grain . A well-known maker of violins himself made what is believed to be the smallest violin in the world . It is only two-and-a-half inches long . Just as magnification tends to coarsen objects , so everyday things made in Lilliputian size have the opposite effect . They have the same attraction that a convex mirror will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in sharp brilliance ; reality enclosed in the compass of a soap-bubble .

There were any number of children 's pieces of furniture made in Victoria 's reign , solid , well-built pieces that have stood up remarkably well to the wear and tear of nursery life . II0 There are nightlight holders to be found in France with a teapot warming on the top , and powder-boxes of maple wood half an inch in diameter with swansdown puffs inside . Those interested in the history of the dressing-table and its accessories should study the evolution of the bedroom , which takes us back to the fifteenth century . Here is a quick glance into the past , which always makes the present so much more interesting . Before the fifteenth century bedrooms were provided for only the rich man and his family and visitors . They must have been exceedingly uncomfortable by our standards , being both damp and cold , though preferable to the then average householder 's sleeping arrangements where straw mattresses round the living-room fire were the best you could expect . By the middle of the fifteenth century , however , bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapestry hangings , a rug on the floor instead of rushes and a feather mattress on the carved wooden bedstead . Above the bed a canopy or tester was hung from the ceiling , and curtains to keep out the draughts were suspended on metal rails fixed to the walls . Moreover , a log fire burned in the big fireplace . But it was only in Eliza-I14 RICHES ON THE DRESSING TABLE bethan days that small rooms with huge beds also accommodated other furniture like chests , chairs , cupboards and toilet necessities such as a ewer and basin , cosmetic jars and boxes , and the ubiquitous chamber pot . Dressing-tables and chests of drawers and even mirrors , except for highly polished metal ones , were still to come . By 1660 " bedchambers " were generally larger and , in well-to-do homes , besides the four-poster with its rich hangings , a table was included in the furnishings , with a dressing-box standing on it , containing drawers and a hinged and sloping mirror . The table was about the same size as the mirror and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing casse were decorated with stumpwork and had a mirror in the lid and secret drawers beneath the fitted compartment for toilet and writing equipment ; or the dressing boxes might be enriched with marquetry or lacquered . Gradually bedrooms became more and more luxurious , with splendid chests of drawers , a tallboy , an elegant toilet glass , tripod washstands , bookshelves and a wig-stand . About 1750 shavingmirrors came into fashion , mounted on a stand . Bedside or work tables were in vogue during the eighteenth century and mirrors were numerous and huge . By 1800 the feminine design of these tables with their tapering legs , small drawers and a hinged mirror , perhaps in the shape of a shield , and all richly painted and decorated , must have greatly enhanced the beautifully furnished bedrooms with their upholstery of flowered silks or stripes of delicate greens and golds . By about 1820 hanging wardrobes began to take the place of the press type and the charming little tripod washstands gave place to the large and massive washstands with mirror backs of the 18 5 os @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where we came in . I156 Sailors ' Love Tokens For the very good reason that absence does not always make the heart grow fonder , sailors have been very much associated with the giving of presents to express their affection for absent wives and sweethearts . They made a great many ships-in-bottles and these lovely little pieces , said to have been made during the long night watches , date from the mid-nineteenth century up to 1914 , after which sailing ships virtually ceased to be . These bottles ornamented many a cottage mantelpiece to remind the sailor of his last ship and his family of the rigours the sailors had to face in those days . The art of making them is not as difficult or slow as we might expect ; the part which took longest was apparently the laying of the foundations inside the bottle , the sea and waves , perhaps a shore scene or a lighthouse . The most sought-after models are the four-masted vessels which were the iron ships called clippers . Scrimshaw work was another occupation peculiar to sailors , a delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , seascapes , whaling ships and other subjects . Sometimes Britannia and her lion figured on a piece of ivory or bone , or mermaids , polar bears or walruses . Hearts and messages of love , names or initials , even religious texts appear on these charmingly decorated pieces . It was the whaler , and not only British ones , either , who made these attractive presents to bring home . These long Arctic voyages gave the men a good deal of leisure , since they were often away from home for stretches of two or three years . I16 SAILORS ' LOVE TOKENS Ornamental stay-busks are generally late eighteenth century , some of carved wood , some of wood inlaid with ivory or perhaps bone , and some entirely of whalebone . The plain carved wood probably are not sailors ' work . All of them were love-tokens and mostly they have verse or name or pictures scratched on them and stained with ink or red dye or perhaps lamp black . Knitting sticks , apple-corers and spoons may have been sailors ' work too . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coconut and stuffed with padding may have been bought at a foreign port , rather than being the actual work of a sailor . The early nineteenth-century shellwork plaques which Queen Mary liked so much ? one is on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum ? are now believed to have been bought by sailors , not made by them . Judith Coolidge Hughes , writing in Country Life on the subject a year or two ago , made it clear that these souvenirs , known as sailors ' Valentines , with the sentimental messages of Truly Thine , Forget Me Not and so forth , were in fact made in the West Indies . The shell mosaics are made from shells common in Barbados and indeed some of the mosaics are inscribed A Present from Barbados . The frames are made from Spanish cedarwood and the lack of individuality also points to them being tourist pieces and not sailor-artist 's work . They are nevertheless most collectable , and as their dates , according to Judith Coolidge Hughes , are from about 1800 to roughly 188o , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most decorative and desirable of sailors ' gifts . A friend , whose seafaring husband was a Master of sailing vessels for some years and who is herself a noted collector , assured me that sailors did not make those amusing pincushions , nor the embroidered pictures of the Victory , celebrating Nelson 's tremendous popularity and heroic death . There is , however , a striking wool picture with a hilly background and a fleet of splendid ships on a wild sea , which is said to be the work of a sailor who was hanged for murder . His sweetheart must have treasured it , since it survives to this day . Or was it her work of loving remembrance ? I17 VICTORIANA The ships in bottles , sometimes made by sailors , date from the middle of the nineteenth century , though spun-glass ships , not made by them , of course , were blown as far back as 1790 , fully rigged and with different colours for flags and bulwarks . Often there was an opaque glass lighthouse under the dome in the background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well have been made for sailors to bring home . Travelling glass-blowers went from fair to fair , pitching their stands and working their small furnaces for everyone to watch . The sailors , who were less agile with their fingers , or perhaps just lazy , could have chosen many of these fairings for keepsakes . The glassblowers allowed their customers to choose what they should make for them , sometimes gossamer-fine trifles contrived from the bundles of glass rods heated by a strong tallow flame , sometimes tiny ships , sometimes a fairylike bird with a spun-glass tail , sometimes a dog or horse . In fact to this day it is possible to find small workshops where you can watch the glass-maker at work over a gas jet , giving you a glimpse of the sort of way the travelling glass-blower used to work a hundred and fifty years ago . The coastal towns of Nailsea , Bristol , London , Newcastle and Sunderland made quantities of souvenirs and love tokens . The famous Nailsea rolling pins , with loops of opaque glass , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pyramids . The French workmen who arrived at Nailsea at the end of the eighteenth century are said to have picked up their technique from itinerant Venetian glassblowers . Their predecessors had learned the art from the Romans , who themselves learned from the Syrians , and so right back to the ancient Egyptians . These rollers , therefore , some of them called " Sailors ' charms " , have a pedigree going back more than 3,000 years . Blue , red , green and opaque white rollers had loving verses on them , very often with a sailing ship and some such inscription as " Love and be Happy " , or " The Sailor 's Pride " or even " The Sailor 's Tear " . They were treated with great care as the breaking of these tokens was believed to herald a shipwreck . Moreover they were often I18 SAILORS ' LOVE TOKENS filled with expensive luxuries such as tea , salt and sweetmeats ; it is even said that these innocent presents were used for smuggling spirits . Shells engraved with words like " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are still carved for the tourist in many seaside towns all over the world . The boxes covered with shells and simple shell frames round a nautical print no doubt pleased many an unsophisticated eye . A great many jugs and basins and even wall plaques were made with an eye on the seafaring men . Sunderland ware , a generic term for several factories , was made from about 1805 , and there are many delightful pieces with bubbly pink borders round pictures of ships or sailors and with appropriate rhymes . For example , what girl could resist " The Token of jack 's safe return to his True-love " , with the legend beneath : If you loves I , as I loves you , No pair so happy as we two . or again : My ship is moored , my wages paid , So let me haste unto my maid . No wonder , as the old song has it , all the nice girls love a sailor . I19 7 Smokers ' Toys When two sailors were put ashore on Cuba by Christopher Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives held in their hands " firebrands " . They were speaking of the ancestor of the cigar , made out of rolled-up tobacco leaves , and the sight of the smoke issuing out of the mouth and nostrils of the Cubans must have been extremely unnerving to the two seamen . In a very short time the news of the pleasing effects of tobacco spread to Europe and one of the ambassadors at the Portuguese court was a Frenchman called jean Nicot , who gave his countrymen the chance of trying this new pleasure , at the same time giving the language a new word , nicotine . Tobacco came to England towards the end of the sixteenth century and Sir Walter Raleigh is usually credited with being the first Englishman to smoke a pipe . The habit caused a great deal of annoyance to a number of people , especially James I , who wrote an angry pamphlet on the subject called " A Blast to Tobacco " . Whether the first English pipes were made of clay or silver is a matter of controversy . They were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco could be afforded only by the rich . But the clay pipes with tiny bowls were the first of their kind , followed by the well-known churchwarden or alderman pipes that were made popular by William III . Clay pipes were decorated from the seventeenth century and the Victorian ones have a splendid assortment of grotesque heads . The English started to smoke cigars during the I20 SMOKERS ' TOYS Napoleonic wars but did n't graduate to cigarettes until the Crimean War , an idea caught from the Russians . At one period it was thought a more elegant way to take tobacco as snuff . This finely-ground powder of the tobacco leaf was introduced by Charles II and it remained a popular habit right through the eighteenth century and well into the nineteenth . Snuff taking is as old as tobacco and , of course , by no means neglected to this day . Collectors of smoking bygones often like to acquire Meerschaum pipes , became of their attractive carving . The word means in German literally " sea-foam " , and the French call it ecume-de-mer equally poetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a form of magnesium silicate and was originally quarried mostly in Asia Minor ; it is said also to be found washed up on the shores of the Black Sea . It is easily carved and the original white colouring gradually darkens with smoking . The easiest types of Meerschaum to find are the human head , but dating is not very profitable , especially as many copies were made , and falsely dated , towards the end of the nineteenth century . They are still being made in Britain , but the imported ones from central Europe were made from the 1750S to I 86o . You can find all sorts of amusing shapes besides heads . There is the typical " naughty nineties " naked lady bowl , often found in a leather case and , in fact , dating a little earlier than 189o . Ships and animals , whole scenes of hunting or war , are beautifully carved in this good-tempered material , but the simpler forms are the earliest . Generally , these have a mouthpiece of wood or ivory and later on amber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlikely to find a Meerschaum pipe without the mouthpiece of another material , though you may well find one with its mouthpiece missing . They are never made with mouthpieces of Meerschaum all in one , as in clay pipes . Sometimes a silver band covers the join of the two materials . Porcelain pipes from Austria and Germany introduce a touch of luxury into a collection , if you are lucky enough to come across a Meissen or Nyrnphenburg head . Later on these porcelain pipes // changed to the shape we know well , with the narrow , long bowl like an elongated clay pipe , attached to an elaborate stem of ivory , bone or wood or even horn . Our period produced only the brilliantly coloured paintings of girls or various scenes of the countryside and tavern . These are still being made today , but like any other antique , the old has a quality immediately recognizable once you face a new one with an old one for comparison . Pottery pipes and even glass pipes were made in England , and though neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay addition in colour and design to a collection . This brings us to cigar holders , which were made in all the same materials as the pipes and would be a most rewarding collectors ' quarry , for they range in subject and design quite as far as pipes . The nineteenth-century Meerschaum cigar holders , or " cigar-pipes " as they were sometimes called , were popular from the 1820s at least , when anything from a lady 's leg to a jockey 's cap could be carved out of this material and sometimes the most macabre pieces were incorporated into the design , such as a mouse 's skull , a chicken bone or a claw . Queen Victoria 's uncle , the Duke of Sussex , was an ardent collector of smokers ' toys and a large number belonging to him were sold by Christie 's in 1843 . Besides the pipes and holders there are many more collectors ' items to be found under our heading connected with the still controversial habit of smoking . For collectors both with little money to spend and with well-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigar boxes , matchboxes and even tobacco taper sticks and miniature tongs for picking up a hot coal to light a pipe . The attractive taper candlesticks , made of solid silver and about four inches high , were for use with pipes or cigars and were never fitted with loose nozzles . They had deep , narrow sockets and were used for over a hundred years by smokers for lighting their clay pipes . As early as the seventeenth century noblemen and royalty rubbed shoulders with the general public at the Great Fairs which had booths owned by milliners , drapers and " toy " - sellers , the last in the I22 SMOKERS ' TOYS eighteenth-century sense of small amusing objects for adults rather than for children . Silversmiths abounded , too , and at St Bartholomew 's Fair , which survived until 1855 , the silversmiths specially designed their wares for gifts . They would have silver tobacco tampers , and silver corkscrews fitted with tobacco stoppers , some with animal heads . Tampers fell out of favour about 1850 , but before this they were made not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wood and brass . The top or handle end was decorated with entertaining designs of animals or people . You may find a jester or a highwayman , hands and legs , animal heads and heads of Nelson or Wellington . Some of these date back as far as Charles II 's restoration . Tinder-boxes are not so easy to find , but you may be lucky and come across a brass or iron one , or better still one shaped like a pistol , which is fired by gunpowder . Tobacco boxes are interesting , too . They are made in several different materials and you 'll find wooden , china , brass , pewter and heavy lead boxes . The taverns used an amusing brass tobacco box with a slot for the coin which released a lock , allowing the customer to help himself to a good twist of tobacco , just enough for one pipeful . In about 1870 the cigarette as we know it today was introduced from the Continent , where it had been smoked freely by the French , Spanish , Italians and Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , but sometimes a curious little wooden tube , a funnel with a ramrod inside it , causes a collector to pause and wonder . This is a cigarette-making machine , possibly coming from France and dating to the 1870s . The funnel was for filling with tobacco a brown paper tube , sold with this little tool in packets , and then pushed down with the accompanying ramrod . Cigarette-holders were also made out of Meerschaum , but the difference in the size of the holes quickly shows which type of smoker was being served . Matchboxes , like tinder-boxes , essential in the collection of anyone specializing in smokers ' toys , are made in many amusing shapes . A pipe was originally lit from a coal held in tongs , or from a candle // or a tinder . For hundreds of years a sulphur match was used as well , this being no more than a twig or splinter of wood which had been given a small tip of sulphur at one end . The eighteenth-century matches were rather like double-ended garden labels and strung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which hung conveniently by a fire . These matches were about six inches long and both the pointed ends had been dipped in sulphur . Except to the historian these matches are not particularly collectable , but by 1828 a certain Samuel Jones of London invented a complicated portable match which came in a box comprising small tubes of acid wound round with paper soaked in a mixture of chemical , sugar and gum , which when required was broken off neatly by a pair of pliers and the paper burst into flames to light your pipe . Dangerous , one would have thought , and expensive since each tube was expendable , but the idea of portable matches was there . It was , in fact , another man called John Walker who , a year earlier , had produced " Friction Lights " which were ancestors of our present-day book-matches . Not to be outdone , Samuel Jones produced a special match for smokers , called a Fuzee , in 1832 . This was a great success , as it smouldered and was torn off in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being marketed in 186o , by which time it was delicately scented . After this came another type called Vesuvius , with an enormous head ignited against any rough surface , but it was very dangerous as its stem burnt off long before the head had finished smouldering , with consequent danger to any burnable clothing or carpets . Lucifers and Congreves and then wax-stemmed Swan vestas appeared on the scene and since they were all much too dangerous to carry loose in the pockets , from about 1830 until safety matches were invented in 185 5 , an enormous number of enchanting boxes were made in which matches could safely be carried . They went on being made long after safety matches appeared , of course . Here the collector comes into his own and looks delightedly for these amusing boxes , all with a roughened surface somewhere about them to show their use . Metal was a favourite material and here you // find boots , shoes , arms and legs , claws of crabs and fishes , Punch , several kinds of owls and other birds , dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a cat on its stool playing a piano . Some are for hanging on a gentleman 's chain across his waistcoat , with his gold watch and seals , while others are for use on the writing desk . Then there are the china fairing types , which in themselves make a charming collection . Generally foreign , they were made in quantities by Conta and Boehme of Possneck in Saxony and appeared at bazaars and fairs from the Great Exhibition in 1851 . Again , look for the grooves either under the lid or hidden on a child 's basket , or the back of an animal , which gives you proof of the box having been designed as a match-holder . The different figures make a varied collection , some being prettier and less crude than others , and there are examples probably intended for the French market . The factories produced all sorts of " bazaar " goods for their ever-growing market abroad . I25 8 Some Chairs to Collect Chairs have not always been as comfortable as they were in Victorian days . Until about 1700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Painted chairs , papier-mache , japanned beechwood , basketwork , bentwood rocking chairs , all can be found in the Victorian era . A birch chair with its rush seat , dated between 188o-85 , is comfortable , elegant and light to carry from one room to another . Mahogany corner chairs with leather seats and rather Gothic looking backs were popular in the i 88os , and squeaky basket chairs with chintz-covered cushions were much favoured at the same period . They originated way back in the third century , forerunners of our garden chairs . Cast-iron garden chairs were popular , too , and some of these , as well as the elaborately decorated garden seats in cast-iron , are fetching high prices today . They often have charming cabriole legs and look delightful in a garden . In fact their interest to us is more in their decorative value and , of course , period flavour than their comfort . They have rounded scrolled backs and sometimes only three legs . Hall chairs were also made of cast-iron during the middle of the nineteenth century . Chippendale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a grotto is all scrolled shells and dolphin legs and looks indescribably uncomfortable . The rocking chair was extremely popular a few years ago , but seems to have gone out of favour again . The bentwood and cane variety was in full swing , so to speak , in the 1860s and continued in favour until at least the i 88os. iz6 SOME CHAIRS TO COLLECT The Great Exhibition saw the advent of the double-chair , with a useful little table-rest in between , and the " companion chair " with three conjoined seats . Its relation , the ottoman , originated in the Regency period and became a centrepiece of the room in about 1850 ; it was designed with a back in the middle so that people could sit all round it , and a potted palm might inconveniently be perched on the centre of it for good value . A similar chair , popular in France in the 1870s , was called the " confidante " . This , however , is getting nearer to the sofa or settee than the chair . Early Victorian papier-mache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved chairs with upholstered seats and backs made of carved walnut , dating to about 185 5 . Rococo-style mahogany chairs , also upholstered , date to the same period and a few years later . An oddity of the late nineteenth century was the divan easy chair . It was an armchair which had a very long seat shaped in a half-moon and projecting beyond the arms so that it would accommodate a pair of weary legs of pretty well any length . The backs of these chairs were usually buttoned and in common with most Victorian inventions for the home were very cosy . Presumably they were inspired by the " duchesse " which Hepplewhite 's Guide ( 1788 ) advertised . This piece of furniture was composed of three parts ? two armchairs and a stool which joined together into an elegant sort of day-bed if required . The so-called lounge or lounging chair , with its long seat and bobbin-turned , barley-sugar woodwork is rather ungainly but comfortable . The Victorians used a great variety of woods , including rosewood and ebony , satinwood , walnut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we reach William Morris and his revival of the cottage work of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries we find craftsmen 's work and old woods being used such as elm , yew and oak . It is probably safe to say that by 1900 practically all furniture was being copied from Jacobean , Stuart or eighteenthcentury designs , so that the originality of such men as first Morris and then Gimson and Barnsley was quite a novelty . Art Nouveau chairs , made about 1899 , show long backs with short legs and often I27 VICTORIANA cane seats ; certainly they are original in design , though how comfortable they are is another matter . There is one point that has to be laboured yet again . Chairs , like ) ther furniture , are faked . That is , they are made up in some cases , ) r repaired , and if you are looking at an armchair , particularly the carver " in a set , it may well have new arms added . This only means Tour chair should cost less , not that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to spot fakes can be found in good books on furniture . Suffice it to remind us that , as one well-known : ollector has said , " the established dealer with a high reputation is a friend of the collector . " So look for a dealer of integrity . One consoation for the higher price you will pay than for what you may pick Ip elsewhere is that your acquisition will almost certainly increase in value with the passing years . 128 9 Art Nouveau Although Art Nouveau had its roots in Victorian days , appearing early in the 188os , its influence reaches far into the twentieth century . Victoriana lovers may instinctively recoil from this strange , imaginative , completely new form of art which repels and fascinates in almost equal doses . It seems to embody the clash between two conflicting ideals . Some will see it only as degenerate ? " that strange decorative disease " , as Walter Crane called it , while practising it himself in his wallpaper designs and book illustrations . Others find in it a new form of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Nouveau is a restless , imaginative , revolutionary anti-style movement which is original , unique and , as they were never tired of saying , new . The producers of fine arts in the first half of the nineteenth century were obsessed by nature . They copied it more or less slavishly just as our artists have always copied past styles . Look at our Renaissance and Gothic architecture . The Art Nouveau followers never did this . They were inspired by Rococo art or by Spanish , Turkish , Moorish and Oriental decorative works and by Celtic and Tudor furniture designs , but they never imitated the sources of their inspiration . Their art was indeed new . They looked at Oriental art or Japanese prints and furniture , for example , and then produced one of their exotic inventions distilled from the particular source that had captured their imagination . After the foundations of Art Nouveau were laid down in England developments of it spread over Europe and to America , and although // VICTORIANA the First World War halted its progress its influence continued . In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager for change with mass-produced ugliness . At its best , Art Nouveau was a purely decorative movement of great vitality , transforming , re-creating and changing the old classical values to a re-styled view of nature , preoccupied with abstraction , curvilinear rhythms and the " scientific " look . Collectors of foresight have been interested in this movement for some time , and sale prices continue to rise . But do remember that selection is even more important in looking for good pieces of Art Nouveau . Those that concern the Victoriana collector are , strictly speaking , ones that were made in the 1880s and 1890s . However , as I have said elsewhere , for a collector to keep too scrupulously within his period is to defeat his own ends . A study of past influences and future developments will enrich his understanding of his chosen epoch . At first a cry of " decadent " was levelled at many poets and artists of Art Nouveau both in England and elsewhere . Wilde and Swinburne , Mallarme and Verlaine are examples , as well as , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beardsley , with their Japanese-inspired neurotic atmosphere . But what a wealth of new , imaginative work we find . Look for those dreamy , fin-de-siecle nymphs on silver and pewter dishes and picture-frames or vases made by British , German and French artists . There was a great silver content in the pewter used at this time and the material polishes to a beautiful sheen . Green and blue enamel was used to decorate silver or pewter . Art Nouveau 's direct ancestor was the Arts and Crafts movement associated with the name of William Morris , who was a friend of Rosetti and Burne-Jones . He was the first to try to improve industrial design , and his taste for simplicity and an unaffected , straightforward style was a strong influence on Art Nouveau artists who followed him . There has been a revival of interest in Morris 's wallpapers and textile designs recently . // Collectors of glass of this period look for the work of Emile Galle of Nancy . He had his own pottery workshop and by 188o was also experimenting with Oriental decorations for glassware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft red , yellow-green , lemon-yellow , orange and violet-blue , all against a greyish white background . He also designed furniture , employing a vast number of skilled workmen in all his enterprises . In spite of this form of massproduction his glass pieces look absolutely individual . In the 1890s such French artists as Edouard Villard and Pierre Bonnard worked for an art shop kept by S. Bing in Paris , and also made stained glass for Louis Comfort Tiffany 's shop in New York . Tiffany 's Favrile glass , patented in 188o , is especially lovely , a flowering of strange botanical forms in brilliant greens , reds and yellows . Tiffany , the son of a fashionable American jeweller , had studied painting in Paris and then experimented in glass from 1875 . Rene Lalique is associated with fabulous flower-inspired jewellery as well as his glass and silver masterpieces . French Art Nouveau jewellery is quite outstanding . Arthur Lazenby Liberty , in London , was another of the three shop owners who were all influential in spreading the gospel of Art Nouveau and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those interested in exploring this particular side of Victorian antiques I recommend strongly a small book by Mario Amaya , called Art Nouveau , published in ' Dutton 's Vista Pictureback series . It is of course impossible to give more than an appetizing foretaste of this fascinating subject in so small a compass . The Victoria and Albert Museum has a botanical extravaganza of a brass coat-rack made about 1895 , and a silver porringer set with semi-precious stones , dated c. 1900 . Those interested in small items may easily find picture-frames , pen-trays , ink-wells , jewellery , glass , pewter , silver and even dolls ' houses inspired by this movement in art . I have myself a charming pair of miniature garden chairs made of silver-laden pewter , which stand outside an 1895 dolls ' house boasting // a wallpaper with the curves and circles beloved by Art Nouveau artists . One comfort for collectors is that they will find it extremely easy to pick out examples of this strangely appealing , very individual style . Whether they pick the best is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that can not be taught . 132 10 Stevens ' Woven Silk Pictures In 1854 Thomas Stevens , who had been in the trade of weaving silks for most of his life , set up on his own . The initial weaving of silk ribbons began in Coventry as early as 1700 , which perhaps we tend to forget . As far as we are concerned , however , the famous Coventry ribbons are associated in our minds with the reign of Queen Victoria and the name of Thomas Stevens . He was a great innovator , always interested in experimenting and improving methods of production , and in spite of a terrible slump in the 1860s , when our market was suddenly flooded with cheap ribbons from the Continent , Stevens ' factory carried on . He had adapted the famous Jacquard loom to his purposes and in 1 863 he sold his first bookmarker . Though this may well have fluttered a few female hearts , for the period was still that of the gifted amateur , home-made objects being the pastime of every girl in the schoolroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found great favour . Before long , booksellers were marketing these attractive novelties which celebrated contemporary events and noteworthy public figures as well as offering Bible verses and birthday or seasonal sentiments to readers . These charming little pictures were , as we have seen , the stock in trade of booksellers rather than drapers , and perhaps it was here that Stevens was original once more . Up until now , as was to be expected , ribbons and brocades were sold at the draper 's shop only . There were not only bookmarkers , Christmas and birthday greeting cards , Valentines // nd calendars with their woven pictures and poems , but also sashes , ) adges and later , in 1879 , the first Stevengraph pictures , ready nounted for framing and hanging charmingly on the parlour walls . Chese appeared to please an enormous public . Literally thousands of he woven pictures were sold , their only fault being , alas , that they are ensitive to sunlight and therefore fade . Stevens moved to London and looked after his thriving business here while his two sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1888 but the family kept the business on for another twenty years vhen it was formed into a company and flourished until the Second World War finally put an end to this enormously successful firm 's life . It was bombed beyond recovery during the Coventry blitz . Austin Sprake is the expert to whom all Coventry ribbon addicts lefer . His book , l written in collaboration with Mr Michael Darby , s an essential for a serious collector , listing as it does all the known ) ictures and book markers , giving invaluable information about their dentification , size and colours and tips for those wishing to display heir collection so that the colours do n't fade through sunshine or ) erish with damp . Many of the pictures are fairly common . The portrait of Queen Victoria , Queen Alexandra and Edward VII are easy to find , though he Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) is rare , especially the one with he portrait facing ahead with flags below . Equally , Queen Victoria is common in her Jubilee portrait facing right , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of an Empire on which the sun never sets " . Others of the Queen are rare . Again , all the " notables and sportsmen " are more or less rare , and ; o are the " Religious , Classical and Historical portraits " , of which , perhaps , Leda and the Swan is fetching the highest price today . The appeal of these little pictures to the Victoriana collector is very simply that they are a mirror of the age . Suppose , for instance , mu decide to collect Exhibitions only , then here you will find repre ; entations of England , America , Scotland and Belgium with an . // absolutely authentic period flavour . The same applies to castles , buildings and views and bridges . You will delight in the fire-engines , coaches , the trains of the period , sports , battleships and boats , military portraits , the pictures of famous jockeys and so on . If you are thinking of building up a picture of the age , here is your best choice . But do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetching as much as L2IO in 1968 . There were others who manufactured ribbons , following in Stevens ' footsteps , and the French firm of Grangier Freres et Ogier produced a collectable ribbon celebrating the victory of England and France over the Russians at the Battle of Alma in 1854 . This is in black and white except for the flags and the scalloped border of green . Stevens ' chief competitor in this field was the English firm of W. H. Grant , also from Coventry . Mr Sprake considers this firm was inferior to Stevens . Since they produced some military and royal portraits it is just as well to be careful not to acquire a Grant when you thought you had a Stevens . Mr Sprake 's book lists some of the subjects that Grant made in about the same size as those of Stevens . They are , however , not very numerous . Finally , it goes without saying that brilliance of colour is the quality we look for , and mounts with trade labels or with descriptive labels . It is possible to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest had only one subject listed and dated 1879 , whereas those with several titles are probably about 188o-81 . As a footnote , an unusual item appeared in a sale catalogue of Stevengraphs in September 1969 : the portrait of Queen Victoria , Queen of an Empire on which the sun never sets was incorporated in a ladies ' companion , complete with bodkins and other necessities , and inside was The Crystal Palace ( Interior ) Stevengraph . It was considered to be unique . Well , Stevengraphs may well be lurking in other unexpected places . // Queen Victoria probably viewed the above-mentioned exhibits unamused , but she did find considerable entertainment from the stuffed animals shown by Hermann Plouquet of Wurtemberg , particularly the frog shaving his companion . Pugin designed a huge stove " in mediaeval style " which looks like a bastard Milan Cathedral . Another stove came from Prussia ; characteristically it was in the form of an enormous knight in armour standing on a pseudo-Gothic looking base made of cast-iron . I found a few curious objects not long ago that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they been invented as early as that . Victorian they are , but of a later date . One is a silver plated ear-trumpet , which looks like a musical instrument at first glance ; another is a brass needlecase like a butterfly , made by Redditch ; a miniature version of a folding harmonium , such as those used at Revivalists ' open-air meetings ; and there is also a grisly inkwell , made from an albatross 's head , that would have frightened the Ancient Mariner into fits . There are certainly many more of these strange inspirations of the nineteenth century waiting to be found by collectors searching for something out of the normal run . 138 12 Workbox Treasure-trove In Victorian days the ladies of the household occupied themselves with " every description of Plain and Ornamental Needlework " and so a number of shops began to trade in " Everything for the worktable " , until by 1873 Pontings opened in Kensington High Street specializing in everything to do with " the practice of art needlework " . In the early years of the century there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of a travelling " laceman " was quite common . He would probably offer the French ribbons which fashionable ladies made use of freely , and " French tulle garnitures " , as well as the tiffanies and waddings , the bugle fringes , gold and silver tissues and gauze satin and crepe flowers to sew on hats or bonnets , caps or turbans . Many of the best trimmings came over from France even in spite of the Napoleonic Wars . Jane Austen , writing to her sister Cassandra , discusses the " whim-whams and fribblefrabble of fashion " and talks about the " gowns " she bought . In fact , this meant the length of material to make a gown . There was always the visiting dressmaker or the sewing-woman in the village who could make this up into a fashionable garment , following a style in one of the monthly fashion magazines . The nineteenth-century needlewoman had a wealth of delightful accessories to her workbox . Up to the 1850S every stitch had to be worked by hand , until the first Singer sewing-machine crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailor invented a similar machine as early as 182.9 , and he exhibited one in the Great // Exhibition of 1851 , but this innovation only slowly entered the average home , and even to this day the preference for hand-sewn articles remains rooted in most women 's hearts , except , of course , for those long weary seams that were so exquisitely worked by our ancestors . Go to the costume hall in the Victoria and Albert Museum , or to Bath 's Assembly Rooms with their splendid array of clothes and underwear . This will give you some idea of the tasks people cheerfully undertook in the pre-machine age . The stitches , the embroidery , the elaborate fringes and tassels and pearls , beads and other decorations which make the early clothes so desirable were all done by hand . It is quite easy to find nineteenth-century workboxes , but nearly always these beautiful leather , wood , papier-mache and mother-ofpearl boxes have been rifled of their accessories . Occasionally we come across one of those charming Sheraton-style workboxes in the shape of a piano , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opened . This is generally fitted with its original silver scissors and stiletto , thimble , tweezers to pick up beads , a needlecase and so forth . One of the most popular treasures is the walnut , lined in velvet and trimmed with ormulu , fitted up with diminutive thimble , scissors and other useful objects . In the trays of oddments that some antique dealers obligingly put out for us to hunt about in there are often amusing little pieces for our empty workbox . You may be lucky enough to find a patchwork pincushion , embellished by those brilliant blue beads , a beadwork scissor or needlecase , a pin-poppet the size of a thimble used for keeping pins in , or some of those pretty thread winders made of wood , ivory or mother-of-pearl . Some of them look like magnified snowflakes in shape . Needleholders are in great variety . They are often in the shape of an umbrella made out of bone , ivory or wood , and even out of silver . Sometimes we find bean pods in the same materials . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of workmanship , the stalk end fitting impeccably on to the pod . Some lovely holders , earlier than our period , were formed into little figurines . // Thread-winders , in use before the days of cotton reels , are in many amusing shapes . The reel itself , with the cotton ready wound on it , was replacing the early shapes by early Victorian days , but the needlewomen , used to the pretty shapes of earlier times , used ornamental reel-holders for many years . Thimbles are , of course , collectors ' items in themselves , and have been for some time . They were found in the ruins of cities like Pompeii and Herculaneium and Elizabeth I owned a number of very costly thimbles . In Victorian days an amusing type of thimble with relief pictures of famous landmarks was made for the tourist trade . You may find thimbles made of bronze , of gold and silver ; there are mother-of-pearl ones from France , glass , wood , and ivory ones ; perhaps best of all are the lovely Battersea and Bilston enamel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are in all sorts of shapes . Eggs and acorns are the most popular . Another quarry is the yard measure , and here again ingenuity thought up any number of different shapes : acorns , cylinders , baskets , bells , eggs and beehives for a start . The materials are legion , too : Tunbridge ware , ivory , shells , wood , ebony and silver are all popular . There is no doubt that anyone with an attractive workbox or workbox table will have endless opportunity for filling it with delightful , beautifully made objects from pincushions to chatelaines and from winding clamps and sewing-clamps of intricate designs to elaborate scissors , powder-sprinklers , wax boxes , darning eggs and hand-coolers . The difference , by the way , between the last two objects is that the darning egg is always made of a light material , whereas hand-coolers could be of any heavy natural stone , especially poor conductors of heat like marble . Glove darning sticks are normally of wood with two round , acornlike knobs on each end of a short rod . Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia Groves tells us , was for removing the grease from fingers . Anyone interested in the absorbing subject of needlework tools should read The History of Needlework Tools and Accessories by Sylvia Groves . 141 13 Silhouettes The true silhouette , a profile cut out by a pair of fine scissors , owes its name to a certain minister of Louis XV 's . In 1757 the King asked M. Etienne de Silhouette to take over the formidable task of reducing State expenditure by half ; it caused a French wit to suggest giving the minister 's name to the very cheap art of making likenesses . The side or profile was therefore called a silhouette , which quickly became common usage . It was no doubt due to the inexpensiveness of profile portraiture , compared to the price of a portrait in oils or a bust in marble , that it lasted so long ? from the middle of the eighteenth century to about 1850 . The most famous artist of the true silhouette after 1825 was Augustin Edouart . Since the Victorian Age customarily is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edouart is safely within our range . Most people would agree that the Georgian profile artists were the finest and that once Queen Victoria came to the throne the art began to deteriorate . This , however , was not the case as far as the French refugee Augustin Edouart was concerned . He came to England in 1815 when he was twenty-six years old and tried to eke out an existence teaching French . After modelling in wax , chiefly dog portraits , he experimented in scissor-cutting and soon made a great success of this deft-fingered craft . He is believed to have cut no less than a quarter of a million profiles , some of which were mounted on a hand- // painted background and some on lithographs , others being simply the black profile portrait of his sitter pasted on to a plain white card . He charged five shillings for full-length portraits and seven shillings if the subject was seated . For profiles of celebrated people of his day he charged three shillings apiece . At the same time the art of scissor profiles had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Brighton pier and elsewhere for threepence and sixpence with coloured versions for one and sixpence , on the time-honoured principle of " penny plain and twopence coloured " . Edouart moved round England , Scotland and Ireland practising his craft in fashionable resorts and soon became celebrated and much in demand . His conversation-pieces featuring the whole family are especially delightful , and one useful point is that he signed most of his work . He was not one of the profilists who gilded or painted his cutouts as other artists used to do . Edward Foster ( 1762 ? 1864 ) made his portraits in a pleasant Indian-red touched with gold , for example . Another well-known scissor-cutter called William Hubard ( 1807 ? 62 ) also used gold for heightening his effects and is noted for his charming landscapes cut out with tiny figures , which , in fact , were meant to be pasted into the fashionable scrap-books of the times . The more elaborate silhouettes during the hey-day of this delicate art are outside our scope but we should consider silhouette jewellery , another offshoot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooches , pins and small boxes for cachous , patches or snuff and began to become the vogue early in the nineteenth century . After having written an erudite book called Treatise on Silhouette Likenesses in 183 5 , Edouart ventured out to America . There must be many examples of his work in that country for he stayed there for ten years . He seems not to have done very much after 185o and died in France , to where he eventually retired , in 1861 . Collectors may be interested in the frames of silhouettes which were used at different times . In the Victorian period either pearwood or bird 's eye maplewood with mitred corners were used , while in the // early nineteenth century black papier-mache with the typical acorn-ring hangers was in favour . Although the art of scissor-cutting lingered on in parlour pastimes , Louis Daguerre 's process known as daguerreotype sounded the death knell to profile portraits and photography took its place as the cheapest form of making likenesses. // The care of your antiques is as important as their acquisition and one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration work , do go to a professional in repairs of your particular class of object . So often home repairs are a catastrophe and do irretrievable damage . If possible , of course , buy goods that are perfect . For one thing should you wish to part with one of your pieces on some later occasion , you will find it extremely difficult to sell cracked or repaired antiques . Treat your antiques with respect , remembering that old materials , prints or water-colours as well as furniture fade in strong light . Central heating can crack and warp wood , so invest in humidifiers to keep the air moist . Insect pests such as woodworm thrive in dust and dirt on the wood they bore into and enjoy a bit of damp too . Threeply wood is their favourite meal . Treat the holes drastically with one of the brands of liquid available and do it again a year later , then keep an eye on it every Spring in case even one destructive beetle has been overlooked . Wash glass very carefully in warm water with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rinsing with cooler water and finally cold . A soft linen towel is best for drying ? not cotton , which leaves tiresome pieces of fluff behind . Decanters should not be put away with the stopper in and remember never to use strong bleaches on old china or pottery . Remember , too , that old bone and ivory are both badly affected by heat and will become warped and distorted . The disastrous effect of heat on , wax dolls is n't likely to be overlooked and extremes of temperature , hot or cold , are bad for them . Fabrics are not so likely to attract moths if cleaned and , of course , one use for those plastic food bags is to keep materials clean and damp-proof. //
