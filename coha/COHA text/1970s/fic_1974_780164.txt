 | The coach carried us down an alley between tall warehouses and then along a high street , thronged with carts , public and private coaches , and occasional sedan chairs . Pedestrians , many of them richly dressed , moved along the sidewalks , or stood looking into shop windows . Even the few ragged urchins darting in and out among the strollers looked well-fed . Tobacco had indeed been good to Glasgow . We turned to our right past a row of close-packed stone houses . The first ones looked well-cared-for , but farther along I saw unscrubbed front steps , smeared windows , and one with rags stuffed into a broken pane . At last the coach stopped before a three-story house with peeling gray paint . The coachman , carrying our baggage , led us up fairly clean steps to the front door . It opened promptly at his knock , and a thin , dark-haired woman of about forty peered out at us . " I 've brought you custom , Mrs. Ludlow . Have you two vacant rooms ? " " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from my father to me and then back again . " Your daughter ? " " Yes , madam . " She opened the door wide . " Come in . " We followed her and the coachman up two flights of stairs . She opened the door of a smallish room that contained two narrow beds , a three-legged stool , and a washstand which held a chipped pitcher and basin . She crossed the room , seized a calico curtain suspended from a length of string and drew it between the beds , dividing the room into two unequal portions . " Now it is the same as two rooms . The privy is out back . The price is four shillings a  | night , with breakfast six pence for each of you . " The price was outrageous , but I hoped my father would not demur . Obviously he needed to lie down , and at once . His face was flushed now , and I feared it was from more than the exertion of climbing stairs . " Very well , madam . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ludlow held out her palm , counted four shillings into it . When they had left us , my father said , " Wait here for me . " You can not go out ! " I touched his cheek . It was burning hot . " You are ill . We must find a doctor . " " And have the fool bleed me ? " I did not try to answer that . It was not only his political opinions which had outraged our Southampton neighbors . He flew in the face of respected medical thought too . It was doctors bleeding their already weakened victims , he said , which kept the village gravediggers busy . " Then at least lie down and rest . " " How can I rest until I know the truth or falsity of what that ruffian told us ? " Yes , it would be impossible for him to rest until he found out . " Very well . But come back as soon as you learn . " When he had gone , I inspected the beds , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there seemed to be no fleas or other vermin . After that I changed from my brown woolen dress to a green muslin from my portmanteau , and sat down to wait . More than an hour must have passed before I heard his slow footsteps on the stairs . I opened the door . One look at his face , and I had no reason to ask if the dockhand had  | told the truth . Shoulders hunched , he walked past me to the far side of the room and sank down on the bed . " Rest , " I said . " Sleep if you can . " As if I had not spoken , he said , " It is true . Fat George 's fat son William beat him . Pray God he escaped to France , but it is not believed that he did . George 's soldiers and local militiamen are combing the Highlands for him , and the Western Isles too . " Obviously he would not rest until he had told me his tragic news . I carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He could have won , " my father said . " He marched as far south as Derby , with the dragoons scattering ahead of him like rabbits . A hundred and fifty miles away , London was in panic . People were storming the Bank of England to draw out their money . The royal yachts were at anchor in the Thames , ready to take George and his household back to Hanover . But Charles did not know all that , and so he listened to his commanders . " He fell broodingly silent . After a few moments I prompted , " And ? " " They wanted the Prince to withdraw north of the Scottish border and wait until French troops joined him before making the final assault . " As my father talked on , I could see how the commanders had reached their fatal misjudgment . They had agreed to march deep into England only because they believed that much of the English countryside would join them . It had not . In the small towns and villages through which the victorious Highlanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people had  | watched them in uneasy or apathetic silence . No wonder the commanders had begun to worry about their estates back in Scotland , left unprotected against English counterassault . Only the common soldiers shared the Prince 's passionate conviction that a victorious army does not retreat . " It must have taken the heart out of them , " my father said , " to turn around , with London so close , and march north . In the English towns , even the small boys jeered at them , because they looked like losers now , even though they were not  --  not yet . " The Prince managed to win two more victories , one of them at Falkirk , where some of the embittered Highlanders gave no quarter to the English wounded , a barbarity that the English were to repay tenfold . For by then the English army , strengthened by troops withdrawn from Austria , was in close pursuit . For the retreating Highlanders , everything seemed to go wrong . Field guns were swept away in river crossings . Supplies arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moor near Inverness , chosen by the Prince for a stand against his pursuers , fortune deserted the Highlanders entirely . " English cannon killed one man in three before the Highlanders even charged , " my father said . " And when they finally did charge , with wind driving icy sleet straight into their faces , English muskets did for most of the rest of them . The few who managed to break through to the English swordsmen beyond found themselves so vastly outnumbered that they had little chance to use their broadswords . " Within ten minutes after that first desperate charge , it was all over . The English , swarming across the battlefield ,  | took their ample revenge for Falkirk . They butchered the wounded Highlanders where they lay , and scoured the nearby fields and ditches and hedgerows for any who might have managed to crawl to temporary safety . " Since then the English dragoons have been all over the Highlands , burning houses and driving off cattle , and searching for the few men who escaped alive from the battlefield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the handbills the English government has issued . They offer thirty thousand pounds to anyone who will seize and bind the Pretender , Charles Edward Stuart , ' and bring him to justice . " Thirty thousand pounds ! It was a vast fortune . If the Prince had not escaped to France , then obviously he had loyal friends throughout the Highlands . Otherwise , someone long since would have collected that reward . Incredibly , my father was smiling . " The Prince must have kept his high spirits , though . They say that he has offered a one-pound reward for anyone who will seize and bind George , the Elector of Hanover . " His smile vanished . He coughed violently for a few moments , and then rested his face in his hands . For a while I said nothing . What words would have been ade-quate ? At last I asked , " And you and I , Father ? What will we do ? " He took his hands away from his face . " A coach leaves for Inverness tomorrow morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Inverness ? Are we going to Bowain Castle ? " " Yes , " he said after a moment 's silence . " I have almost no money , and so there is nothing else to do . We should  | be able to find some sort of conveyance to take us there , at least a wagon . " Not only reluctance but fear was obvious in his voice and his averted gaze . I said , " I have always felt you never wanted to see Bowain Castle again . Why do you feel that way ? " " I can not talk about it now . Before we arrive there , I will tell you . " " But do n't I ? " " Of course you have a right to know ! " His tone was almost fierce . " But your father is a coward , Elizabeth . That is something I have discovered these past few weeks . Now let me rest , Daughter . Let me rest . "  | The coach lurched . Miss Lucy Phipps , on the seat opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout man on her right . At the same moment her feet lifted slightly from the floor , revealing the torn ruffle of a green satin petticoat . The stout man laughed . The man on her left , almost equally stout but younger , grasped her arm and drew her to an upright position . " A rough road , " he said , " makes for closer acquaintanceship . " The other three passengers already had been seated when my father and I reached the coach yard on Glasgow 's high street that morning . The men , both associated with Glasgow tobacco firms , were on their way to Inverness . So was Miss Phipps , a tall , dark-haired woman of about thirty . She came , she told us , from London , where she sang in opera . But when we were only a mile or so from Glasgow , moving through green pasture land toward low hills , their rounded tops dimly visible through the morning mist , the older of the two men produced a brandy bottle . At first Miss Phipps refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her portmanteau and took out a small silver tumbler . From then on the three of them drank , the men from the bottle , she sipping genteelly from the tumbler the stout man kept filled . And as the banter between the three grew louder and bolder , I came . the unmistakable conclusion that the source of Miss Phipps 's income was not singing . Now she said , " What ails that driver ? Laws ! I thought a pack of those hairy Highlanders had rushed out to seize the horses . " " You mean Stuart 's Highlanders ? " the younger man asked . " No danger of that , my pretty . He 's skulking around somewhere in the north . " " They do say , " Miss Phipps answered , " that he is as handsome a man as a girl could hope to meet . " " Now , now ! " The older man wagged a finger at her . " You will find Inverness full of English soldiers . And better a dragoon in the bed than a prince in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her free hand pushed his shoulder . My father said , from the corner where he sat huddled , " Please , madam ! Please , sirs ! " I knew that his indignation was not just on my behalf . He resented the manner in which they discussed the Prince . The older man said , " Begging your and the young lady 's pardon . " Miss Phipps looked at me , her rather fine eyes holding a strange blend of resentment and what appeared to be wistfulness . " Hoity-toity ! " she said , and tossed her head . But after that all three of them , although they continued to drink , spoke less freely . My father had not accepted the brandy offered by the Glasgow men , nor had he drunk from the bottle I knew he  | carried in the pocket of his greatcoat . I myself had bought the brandy . I had gotten up that morning , after a night made almost sleepless by his coughing , and found my father awake , but still in his bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and with the skin drawn tight over his facial bones  --  that my heart contracted with terror . " We must stay here . You are unfit to travel . " " We have no money to stay here . " He looked at his purse , lying on the washstand . " Go to an inn or grog shop . Get me some rum . " When I stood silent , he said , " I know , Daughter . The one thing I never asked you to buy for our household was spirits . But believe me , it is medicine to me now . Without it I will not be able to rise from this bed . And I must . " In the ground floor hall I encountered Mrs. Ludlow . There were no inns nearby , she told me , and no grog shops open at that early hour . " I have no rum , but I can sell you brandy . There is only a little gone from the bottle . It will cost you three shillings . " I paid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried back up the stairs , feeling weighted by far more than the bottle in my hand . All that day , while the coach followed the road northward , sometimes across treeless moors , at other times beside rock-choked rivers foaming through narrow glens , I dozed and awoke , dozed and awoke . Thankfully I saw that my father sometimes slept too , despite the almost constant talk and laughter of our fellow passengers . Around six o'clock we stopped at an inn , an establishment so rude that beyond its threshold I halted in disbelief . One room , apparently , served as parlor , taproom ,  | kitchen , dining room , and bedroom of the couple who owned the place , for in a shallow recess at one side of the room stood a crudely made wooden bed . In the opposite wall were two doors which I assumed  --  correctly , as it turned out  --  led to separate sleeping quarters for men and women guests . In the center of the floor was the hearth , a circular pit whose smoke , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the roof . Over the hearth a big cooking pot hung from a tripod . Beside our own party , there were two other guests at the inn , a gaunt , middle-aged woman and her daughter , an equally gaunt spinster of about thirty-five . The older woman told us briefly that her man was dead , and that she and her daughter were traveling , mostly on foot , to Aberdeen , where they had kin . A guarded look in her eye made me wonder if her husband had died at Culloden , or at the hands of one of the search parties sent out to track down those who had managed to escape from the battlefield . Despite the smoke stinging my nostrils and throat , I ate with good appetite the food served at a long table by our bald host  --  loaves of coarse bread , and rabbit stew which his carroty-haired wife measured out of the big pot into wooden bowls . When supper was finished , my father , who had eaten little , went to bed . So did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phipps and the Glasgow men at the table . In the women 's quarters , I found that there was a bed large enough for two persons , and on the floor a number of pallets . As the youngest of the three , I of course took one of the pallets . Despite the lumpiness of the straw-filled mattress and the room 's chill striking through the rough blanket , I soon fell asleep , and was only dimly aware , sometime in the night , of Miss  | Phipps moving unsteadily past my pallet to one of her own . In the morning I saw with reviving hope that my father seemed slightly improved . He ate at least a little breakfast and , once we had resumed our journey , sat more erect in his corner of the carriage . Miss Phipps and the Glasgow men , though , seemed lower in spirits . Perhaps there had been some quarrel among the three of them the night before . Perhaps yesterday 's brandy did not sit well . Whatever the reason , they rode in silence broken only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered imprecation from the elder of the men , whenever a jounce of the coach flung them against each other . Shortly before noon , though , a bottle began to circulate among them , and soon their talk and laughter was almost as lively as during the day before . We were traveling an upland moor by then . Every few minutes we saw evidence of the English revenge upon those who had fought for Charles Stuart at Culloden , or given refuge to those who survived the battle . We passed slaughtered cattle , grain fields burned to black stubble , and charred heaps which had once been farmhouses or herdsmen 's huts . When Miss Phipps called it " a shocking sight , " the younger of the Glasgow men retorted that the rebels were getting " their just deserts " for Falkirk , and for stealing English farmers ' hogs and chickens while " Billy was chasing them north . " My father said nothing at all , but just grew more shrunken in his corner of the coach . I was not surprised when he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rum bottle he must have bought from the innkeeper that morning , and drank from it . Gig-  | gling , Miss Phipps parted her lips to speak . But perhaps the bleakness of my father 's face touched her , because she made no comment . I turned my head and looked out the window , aware of a hillside with thin mist now hiding , now revealing , brown rocks and green bracken , but not really seeing it . Soon this nightmare journey would be over . The coachman , we had learned at breakfast , hoped with a change of horses to reach Inverness soon after the long summer twilight ended . By day after tomorrow , conveyed there by some sort of vehicle , we would be at Bowain Castle . No need to fear that on Macduveen lands we would find burned huts and slaughtered cattle . Since the Macduveens had been , and no doubt still were , strong supporters of the Hanoverian monarchy , they would have been spared the attentions of the English search parties . Again I wondered at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been born . Was it humiliation he feared ? Perhaps , because he indeed would find it humiliating to return , ill and almost penniless , to kinfolk from whom he had parted , probably in anger , thirty years before . What was more , the Macduveens would be exultant over the defeat of the man he had crossed an ocean to serve . My heart ached for him , but at the same time I felt exasperated . In fact , ever since we had landed in Glasgow , I had felt a growing exasperation with male contentiousness in general , and Scotsmen 's contentiousness in particular . My father himself had admitted that for centuries the Scots had fought , not only against the English , but with each other  --  Highlander against Lowlander , clan against clan , Catholic against Protestant , and various Protestant sects against other sects.  | Near sunset we stopped at an inn to change horses and to eat a supper of cold mutton , turnips , and oaten cakes , baked on a griddle , which the innkeeper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were traveling along a hillside above a shallow valley , when the coach suddenly lurched to the right so violently that I was sure it would crash onto its side . Through Miss Phipps 's scream and my own , I heard the crack of wood , and knew that the right rear wheel had broken . But the coach did not tip over . It remained at a steeply pitched angle , supported by some object at the roadside . With difficulty the coachman forced the door open and helped us to the ground . I saw that the coach and its shattered wheel rested against a boulder . The coachman , a tall , dour-faced man , told us that a hare had run under the horses , causing them to rear . There would be no chance , he said , of repairing the wheel before darkness fell . Fortunately the night was mild . While I stood at the roadside looking down a gentle slope to the dying gleam of a narrow river in the valley , the coachman and the Glasgow men ranged along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peat dropped from farmers ' carts . Soon a fire was kindled . Its reddish light flickered over my father , lying huddled on the ground , silent except when coughs racked him , and over the coachman 's somber face and the flushed and increasingly drunken faces of out three fellow passengers . At first indignant over the prospect of spending a night in the open , they now seemed to be enjoying it . Their talk grew bawdier and bawdier . At last , when Miss Phipps and the younger man began a playful struggle over the handkerchief she had snatched from him and thrust  | into the bosom of her gown , the coachman rose and walked over to the iron-bound leather trunk attached to the rear of his disabled vehicle . He came back with a brown blanket folded over his arm . Standing with his back to the others , he said , " Take this , lass . Stay the night down by the river . Your father is asleep and has no need of you . " I was tired , and longed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strange countryside , where wild beasts might pad silently toward me . . . I said , " I have heard there are wolves in Scotland . " " Not many now . And in summer those few find game to feed them . They will not harm you . But what you witness here endangers your immortal soul . " I realized that here must be another sort of contentious man in this eternally quarrelsome land . Probably he belonged to the Covenanters , that most extreme of dissenting sects , who for a hundred years had not only warred against Popery , but found other Protestants insufficiently strict in their views . I stood up and said in a low voice , " Spread the blanket over my father . " " Aye , " the coachman said , after a moment , " he has more need of it , poor man . " He covered the huddled figure on the ground with the blanket . My father stirred , but did not awaken . I do n't think Miss Phipps and her companions were even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no moon , but the stars were bright enough to guide me down the slope through the bracken . I paused once , but finding I could still hear talk and laughter , moved on . Finally I went around a copse  --  the trees  | looked like pines , although I could not be sure in that faint light  --  and chose a spot near the riverbank . Lying with my cloak wrapped closely around me , I pillowed my cheek on my hands . Somewhere nearby there was a waterfall , its sound as continuous as silence . Longingly I thought of that castle in the western Highlands , where at least my father 's fever-wasted body could find rest , no matter what the cost to his pride . With another sort of longing , a hopeless one , I thought of John Harwood , who perhaps by now had taken Charity Clayman or some other girl to the Harwood house as his bride . Then exhaustion overcame me , and I slept . Perhaps some sound awoke me . Perhaps it was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone . Whatever the reason , I came awake in the gray dawn and , my heart leaping with alarm , sat bolt upright . There were five of them standing around me in an uneven circle . Bearded men in Highland dress , their long plaids tossed over their shoulders , their faces  --  ranging in age from youth to middle age  --  silent and intent . I said , trying to keep the quaver of fear out of my voice , " Who arc you ? What do you want ? " I heard the whispering sound of someone moving through the bracken . The circle parted , making way for another man , a tall one who appeared to be in his middle twenties . His fiery red hair was long and unkempt , his black coat rusty , his plaid kilt torn and muddy , and his legs and feet bare . And yet I think that I knew , even in those first few seconds , who he was . His eyes  --  brown eyes , not the blue ones which often accompany that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused sympathy . " You dolts , you have frightened  | her . " He spoke with an accent I had never heard before . " Think what she must feel , waking to find herself surrounded by such wild-appearing men as yourselves . " But there was no more real anger in his voice than in the smile that curved his mouth , a singularly handsome mouth with a full lower lip . " Saving your pardon , " the man on his left said with some asperity , " but ' t is you who is the dolt . There are people up on the road , no more than half a mile away , and no friends to us , judging by what I heard of their talk last night . " " " Then go back into the copse . I will be with you soon . I wish to speak to this lady . " One of them muttered something that sounded like , " De'il take the lady . " But they turned , waded through the bracken , and disappeared within the pinewood copse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you of that coaching party ? " " Yes . " " I do not wonder that you chose to sleep here . Last night one of us came close enough to tell that they were far gone in their cups . " He paused . " Are you English ? " " No , American . " " American ! " From the copse came a soft whistle . He ignored it . " What part of America ? Virginia , perhaps ? " " No , Long Island . " " The Long Island ? " He looked puzzled . I remembered how years ago my father had told me , to my astonished delight , that in Scotland Skye is called The Long Island . " My Long Island is off the coast of America , south of Massachusetts Bay . "  | Another low whistle from the copse . He said , " Why is it that you have crossed the ocean , lady ? " I was silent for an indecisive moment . Then I said boldly , " It was my father 's choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart , as he was thirty years ago to James Stuart . But when we landed at Glasgow last Monday  --  " My voice trailed off . He said wryly , " In Glasgow you learned that Charles had been no luckier than his father . " Then , cheerful again : " But the game is not played out yet . Someday Charles may be able to welcome you to St. James . And a fine welcome he would give to a man who had crossed the ocean for the cause . " " I am afraid my father would not ? " My throat began to close up , but I managed to say , " My father is very ill . " His smile vanished . " I am sorry to hear that . " " Once we reach Bowain Castle , perhaps he will get well . " " Bowain Castle ? " He frowned . " The Macduveens ? They are no friends of the Stuarts , you know . " " We know . But my father is not only ill . He is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but to turn to them . " " What is your name , lady ? " " Elizabeth Logan . " Again that soft , urgent whistle from . the copse . He said , " I wish you a safe arrival , Elizabeth Logan . And if it be of any comfort to you , know that in all my travels , and I have traveled much of late " ? a wry smile twisted his mouth  --  - " in all my travels , I have seen no face that pleased me more than yours . May it be your fortune , and may your father get well . "  | He turned and strode on muddy bare legs through the bracken . The copse swallowed him up . I got to my feet and brushed bits of bracken from my cloak . Hopeful that the news would bring gladness to my father 's eyes , I skirted the copse and hurried toward the distant road . After a while I heard the sound of metal against wood . I found the coachman and a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replacing the last of the wheel 's shattered spokes with a new one . Miss Phipps and the Glasgow men stood in pale-faced , dispirited silence , watching the crofter force one end of the spoke into the hub . My father , huddled in his greatcoat , sat on the ground several yards away . I sat down beside him . The face he turned to me was so flushed , so unnaturally bright of eye , that my heart contracted . No need to ask how he felt . But perhaps my news Would be tonic to him . " Father , " I whispered , " he is still alive , and free ! I talked with him down by the river . " For a moment he appeared puzzled . Then his face cleared , and I knew he had understood . " Tell me ! I ) id he appear in good spirits ? " " Remarkably so , for a man with a price on his head . " Answering my father 's swift questions , I told him every detail of my encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He speaks strangely , with an accent I never heard before . " " Of course , child . He speaks English as an Italian would . He grew up in Rome , remember . " A fit of coughing racked him . When he again turned his face to me , I saw that a certain vagueness had come into his eyes . " Tell me , lass , did ye find him bonnie ? "  | When I was a child , often he had amused me by speaking in the manner of the Highland common folk . Somehow it did not amuse me now . But all I said was , " Yes , Father . He is bonnie . "  | The cart , drawn by a shaggy little horse , drew us farther into the glen . It was so narrow that its turbulent stream almost touched the cart 's creaking wheels as we moved along the dirt track , and so deep that its murky light might have been that of two hours past sunset instead of an hour before . We were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father always had said was the most beautiful . But it was hard for me to appreciate the fragrance of ferns and the frothy white of a burn rushing down the hillside toward the narrow river . All my attention was centered upon my father . He lay on his side with knees bent in the small cart , his head pillowed upon my portmanteau . Through the creak of wheels and the sound of hurrying water , I could hear the rasp of his breath . I thought , with cold despair , " He is going to die . " As recently as two nights before in Inverness , I 'd still felt hopeful . I had insisted that , even though the cost was staggering in that town overcrowded with soldiers with money to spend , he engage a private bedchamber at the  | inn . A night of undisturbed sleep , 1 had believed , might restore his flagging strength . In the morning , after a fairly restful night in a room I shared with only one other woman and her ten-year-old daughter , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be transported to Bowain Castle . And it was I who , in the inn yard , agreed to pay one pound , plus his bill at the inn we would have to stop at on the way , to the crafty-faced carter who now sat up there on the narrow wooden seat . But all my efforts had served , not to dam my father 's ebbing strength , but to drain most of what little was left in his purse . We emerged into a wider valley where , in alternate sunlight and shadow , sheep grazed in the purple heather . From the valley floor the road rose in serpentine curves up the mountainside . We creaked slowly to the crest . And there my breathing , even my heartbeats , seemed to stop for a moment . Below us lay a long , irregularly shaped loch , its cloudshadowed waters a grayish blue . To the north and south of the loch rose wave upon wave of mountains , some a deep blue , and some , where the cloud cover was thinner , the purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the sun shone , mountains rose in a ragged golden wave . I thought , " The mountains of Skye . " That was the moment when , despite our journey 's hardships , despite those blackened fields and slaughtered cattle , despite even my despair over my father  --  that was the moment when I lost my heart to Scotland , never to recover it . My father had grasped the side of the cart to pull him-  | self to a sitting position . I asked , " Are those Skye 's moun-tains ? " They are . " After a moment he added , " And that is Loch Ulain , where she drowned herself . " le meant Arabella , my great-aunt . How wretched indeed she must have been , to close her eyes willingly to all this wild beauty . " Were you still in Scotland then , Father ? " " No , I had gone to London by then . But people talked of it , even there . " " ' Then are we close to Bowain Castle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It is not far . " " Lie down , Father . Rest . " Through light that brightened with sunset , we descended to the loch , followed its shore for a while , and hen turned up another narrow glen . Twilight had begun hen we emerged onto a vast , undulating moor . On rising ground near what I knew must be the moor 's seaward edge , rose a stone tower , perhaps sixty feet high . Surely it must be the one of which my father had told me . The old , old tower , where from time to time , or so the legend said , a woman with a torch appeared behind that crenelated parapet . And that other , much more massive structure at the moor 's edge , perhaps three miles ahead of us , was surely Bowain Castle . I looked at my father . Although his eyes were closed , the tension in his thin face told me that he was not asleep . It also told me that there was no need to apprise him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right rose an extensive wood of pines and  | broad-leaved trees . Centuries ago , my father had told me , trees covered most of Scotland . But except for isolated stands they were gone now , felled to make ships in Aberdeen and Glasgow and London , leaving the moors to the heather and bracken and spiny gorse . We were passing the wood now . The cartman half turned around on the seat . Was it just the cast in one eye that gave him that sly look ? I did not think so . He said , pointing with his whip , " The lady could have saved herself a long walk . " " What lady ? " " The one as drowned herself . " So he had been listening . " ' That 's Bowain Wood . There 's a pack of wolves in there that would have finished her off a lot quicker than the loch must have . " I look at him coldly , not speaking , until he turned back to his driving . A few minutes later the cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road leading up to the castle . I saw now that it was of stone that probably was reddish , although it looked dark brown at this past-sunset hour . Above a solid foundation perhaps fifteen feet high , two rows of windows , gleaming dully in the twilight , stretched between the corner round towers . The carter turned on the seat , grinning , and said , " You are here . " I cried , " Are n't you taking us up to the castle ? " " It will cost you another shilling . That road is rough . I might break a wheel . And the horse is tired . " " The horse is tired ! My father is ill , blast you ! And you expect us to walk half a mile up a slope , carrying our ? " " Do n't argue with him , Daughter . " My father had low-  | ered himself to the road , and now stood clutching the cart 's side . " We have no shilling to spare . And besides , it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Plainly the fever had clouded his mind . But I kept silent . Carrying the portmanteau , I got down to the road . The carter , looking disgruntled , took our small hand trunk from under the seat and handed it down to inc . With a slap of the reins , he turned the cart and drove off . I said , through the dwindling creak of wheels , " I 'll carry the hand trunk . And we will stop and rest every few yards . " As we started up the gentle slope , I saw for the first time that there was an archway near the southern end of the castle 's high foundation . Beyond that archway we would find those who , no matter what the quarrels of thirty years before , would be bound by the ancient laws of kinship to shelter and care for my father . And perhaps , once he rested on a feather mattress and ate nourishing food , that shadow which seemed to hover almost visibly around him would lift , and he would be spared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a coach , drawn by two sleek brown horses , emerge from the archway and move swiftly toward us . Evidently someone had glimpsed us from a window , and dispatched the coach to meet us . My father had halted . As I too stopped and lowered the hand trunk to the ground , I was aware that he had taken off his beaver tricorn . The coach slowed , halted beside us . The passenger beyond the window was a plump , handsome woman of middle age , with a red-plumed black velvet hat set on her brown hair . Her round face had that placidity which can arise from either a spotless conscience  | or a serene indifference to everything except one 's own comfort . On the driver 's box sat a sandy-haired man of forty-odd in worn green livery . His small , good-natured eyes went from my father 's face to mine , where they lingered for a moment with a faintly puzzled expression . Then he looked back at my father . " Why , it 's young Walter Logan ! Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll swear the years have dealt more kindly with me , even allowing that I 've lived half a dozen less of them . But I 'd still know it is you , if only by that mickle scar on your forehead . I mind the day Jenny gave you that clout with a tankard 's edge . " He paused . When my father said nothing , the coachman went on , with a chuckle , " You 'd let the fire go out , and her with a suckling pig to roast . And so she picked up that tankard ? " " Kenneth , stop nattering . " The woman in the plumed hat had leaned a little way out of the window . " Who are these people ? " The coachman turned on the high seat and looked down . " Walter Logan , milady . ' T was before your time , but he was scullion here when I was stableboy . He ran off when I was nine or thereabouts . His father , old Walter , had been the castle shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first Lady Macduveen , I mean . " I accepted his words as true . But I accepted them only as one , in the numbing grip of a nightmare , accepts as true the fact that the turning of a familiar head has revealed the grotesque face of an utter stranger .  | The woman I realized must be Lady Macduveen looked at me . " Are you his daughter ? " I nodded , unable to speak . " Begging your pardon , milady , but I take it that the Lady Macduveen I knew is dead . " My father 's labored voice was dull , humble , and shorn of all its cultivated modulations . If he had not been standing right beside me , hat in his hands , shoulders hunched beneath his greatcoat , I would not have believed it was he who spoke . " Oh , yes . She died twenty-seven years ago . " " And Sir James ? " " He has been dead for five years . My son , Sir Donald , is the present laird . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent brown eyes as my father bent over in a coughing fit . Finally she said , " But my good man , you are ill ! " Alarm crossed her face . " You are not carrying plague , are you ? " I found I could speak . " It is not plague . He has a congestion of the lungs . He has had it for weeks . " She frowned slightly , as if she found something in my manner not to her liking . Then her brow cleared . " You may go up to the castle . Someone will give your father a place to lie clown until he is better . And tell them in the kitchen that you are to be given employment . Drive on , Kenneth . " The smile she gave us , as the coach began to move , seemed to hold a sense of her own graciousness . But that she should leave us to struggle up the slope , and still think herself generous , did not surprise me . It was just part of the bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had revealed .  | I grasped my father 's arm . " Sit down . " When he was seated on the hand trunk , his hat once more shadowing his face , I stood looking down at him . Even today I turn sick with shame at memory of the rage which shook me . " Now tell me , " I said . " Tell me . And no more lies . "  | He did not speak , but just raised his eyes to my face , the hopelessly guilty eyes of a whipped dog . My handsome father , whose jaunty elegance had always been my delight . My anger disappeared under a flood of sorrowful tenderness . Dropping to the ground , I laid my hand on his bony fevered one . " Please . I must know now , while we are still alone . Why did you lie ? " His voice sounded very tired , but strangely calm , as if the abandonment of deception brought him a kind of peace . " I lied because I so wanted to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boy . You see , my mother could read . She learned it from her father , a crofter who had wanted to be a priest before priesthood became too dangerous , and when I was six , she began to teach me . That alone made me feel I was set apart from the other servants . " He stopped speaking . I said , " Was anything of what you told me true ? Did you really fight in the 1715 Ris-ing ? " " I did . Both my parents were dead then . I ran away and  | fought for James Stuart at the Battle of Preston , and after the battle was lost , I went to London . " He stopped speaking . Steeling myself to ask the question , I said , " And your scar ? " " I got it as Kenneth said , when I was fourteen . " The thickening of his voice told me that he was reliving the shame and rage of that long-ago moment . In my mind 's eye I saw the heavy tankard raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook ? scullery maid ? ? and saw its edge bite deep into the young boy 's forehead . " And in London , Father ? " " I became an actor at the Drury Lane . " There was a faint note of pride in his labored voice . " I played Sheridan , and Congreve . " " Is that how you learned to dress and speak like ? like ? " " No , it was chiefly a woman I had to thank for that . But I can not talk of it . It is not a story for the ears of an innocent girl , especially one 's own daughter . " " Innocent ! " Some of my anger returned . " That is an excuse men use when they want to keep us ignorant of things we should know . And you have kept me ignorant far too long . " He told me , then . The woman had been a rich merchant 's widow , more than twice my father 's age , and with grown children . She had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a note to him in care of the theater manager . The final result was that he took up residence in her house , and lived there for seven years . She must have regarded him as a son as well as a lover , for she provided him with tutors in Greek , Latin , and mathematics , and later secured his entrance to Oxford .  | When she contracted what she correctly guessed to be a fatal illness , she gave him a thousand pounds . After her death , he emigrated to Southampton , purchased his property on Job 's Lane , married my mother , and set himself up as tutor to the sons of prosperous and ambitious fathers . " There seemed little chance of anyone ever learning the truth about me . And so there seemed no harm in ? representing myself as I did . " No harm , except that he had falsified his whole life . Why had he done it ? Was it to try to deny what he saw each time he looked in the mirror ? That scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been a potboy at the mercy of a brutal fellow servant ? " And by the time you were three , I was glad of the lies . Your face was taking shape even then , and you had that proud , spirited way of carrying your head . I felt you had a right to think yourself of gentle blood . " I wanted to say , " But I did not care about that ! " When he had talked of Scotland , what had enchanted me had been the thought of Castle Bowain and the western Highlands , not the titled people I had believed to be my kinfolk . Aside from being Walter Logan 's daughter , the only distinction I had ever aspired to was to be John Harwood 's wife . John . As I sat here in this strange and cruel and beautiful land , with the moor stretching around me in the deepening dark , it seemed to me that John and the treeshadowed streets of Southampton were not merely an ocean away , but on another planet . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in Boston , or while we were on the ship ? "  | " Because I hoped that in a way I could make the lie come true . ' They say that the Prince is generous to his friends . I hoped that , by attaching myself to his cause . . . I thought of Charles Edward , that handsome scarecrow , standing with hare , scratched legs knee-deep in bracken . That fugitive with no lands or titles to bestow , with nothing , in fact , but the loyalty of such rough-looking friends as those who had waited in the copse , and his own undaunted cheerfulness . I said , " Do you think you can go on now ? It is almost dark . " He nodded . I helped him to his feet and handed him the portmanteau . He stood there , swaying , while I picked up the hand trunk With him leaning against me , we started up the slope .  | The old man named Angus had brought a candle stub into the shed . Its light wavered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have stood , and over the heap of straw where my father lay , his eyes narrowed to slits through which the whites showed . He no longer coughed , but drew each breath with a labored , rasping sound that filled me with despair . He had managed to stay on his feet until we had moved through the archway and along a vaulted tunnel into the courtyard . Dimly I was aware of a rear archway , above which a torch burned , and of a row of wooden shacks stretching along the high stone wall to my left , and of onestory buildings along the wall opposite . The first of those stone buildings , apparently , was the castle kitchen , for flickering firelight fell through its wide doorway onto the cobblestones . We had taken only a step or so toward that doorway when my father collapsed into a heap beside me . With a cry , I knelt on the cobblestones . As I loosened the stained and wrinkled stock knotted around his throat , I was aware of approaching footsteps . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a tall girl of about my own age whose long dark hair sprang from low on her forehead , and an even taller woman of late middle age . " Please , " I said , " could you ? " " Who are you ? " the woman asked . Her small eyes , which appeared gray in this uncertain light , were staring at my upturned face with an antagonism which seemed as strong as it was inexplicable . " My father 's name is Walter Logan , " I said swiftly . " Mine is Elizabeth . Please help me to ? " " Walter Logan ! " Grunting with effort , she leaned over and plucked the hat from his head . " So it is , " she said , straightening . She gave a brief laugh , and dropped his hat to the cobblestones . " Ran away to help your precious Papist , did n't you , young Walter ? And now you are back . What for ? To help his son play hide-and-seek with the En-glish ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us we could find shelter here . " She looked at me with such enmity that for a moment I thought she was going to turn her back on us . Then she said , " You , Mag . Help Angus get him into the old cowshed . And then come back to the kitchen . You mind ? Her ladyship is bringing two more guests for supper , as if it was n't enough with Clarence MacElvin and his wife here . So do n't you dawdle , hear ? " The girl 's voice was sullen . " Aye , Jenny . " Carrying the hand trunk and the portmanteau , I followed the old man and the girl as they half dragged , half carried my father across the cobblestones . Inside the shed , its doorway so low that the old man and the girl had to stoop , they lowered him to a pile of straw in one corner .  | When they had gone , I sat on the floor , listening to the labored breath , my eyes fixed on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while Angus had returned . In one hand he carried the lighted stub of a candle set in an earthenware dish , and in the other a stone jug with a pewter cup inverted over its mouth . He set the candle on a stall rail , and the jug on the dirt floor beside me . " I 've brought you water , lass . " Then , looking down at my father : " He looks verra sair , poor man . That was one of the old Scottish expressions with which my father used to amuse me . For a moment my throat closed up . Then I said , " Yes , I fear he is . " " ' T were better he sleeps now . But when he wakes , ask Jenny for a drop of broth . " Jenny , the woman who had scarred a young boy for life . A powerful-looking woman even now , she must have been a veritable Amazon thirty years before . " Did you know my father ? " " No , Jenny says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Lady Macduveen brought me here as chief hosteler . The second Lady Macduveen , that is . " He paused . " If you have need of me , the stables are back of the courtyard . You 'll find me there . " He left me then . I do not know how long I sat there . Through my father 's labored breathing I now and then heard other sounds . Shouts of laughter and young masculine voices singing came from somewhere above , probably from the castle windows overlooking the courtyard . Metal pots banged in the kitchen , and once I heard Jenny upbraiding someone , probably the girl Mag . Then , when the candle had almost burned down into its pool of grease , I  | heard a carriage stop in the entrance tunnel . There had been an open door there , I recalled , with a flight of stairs leading upward . I heard several voices , including Lady Macduveen 's . Then the empty coach , with the coachman Kenneth on the box , rolled across the cobblestones toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that woke my father . " Bess ? " I leaned over him . " How do you feel ? " He did not answer . His gaze was moving over the rough beams overhead , and the stall 's rotting rails . " In the morning , " I lied , " you are to have a room with a real bed . Would n't you like some broth now ? " He shook his head . " Please , Fathher ! " " Very well . " Then , as I started to rise , he laid thin fingers on my wrist . " Some of what you always believed was true . I am sure of it . You are my surety . " I said , with despair , " Yes , Father . " He was slipping from me fast now . His mind was clouded , and the fingers lying on my wrist were no longer fevered , but very cold . " I 'll get you the broth . " I hurried across the cobblestones . In the shadowy kitchen Jenny sat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A half-plucked goose , long neck dangling , lay across her lap . I said , " May I take my father some broth ? " She looked at me , coldly silent . Then , swiveling around on the stool , she faced a doorway in the far corner of the room . I heard footsteps climbing stone stairs . The girl Mag , grasping an uncorked wine bottle in each hand , entered the room . " You are not to take the wine up , " Jenny said . Then , as angry protest flared in the girl 's face : " Oh , I know . You were hoping to flaunt yourself before Sir Don-  | aid . As if he 'd look at a great , gawky , ill-shaken-up creature like you . " The words were unjust . Except for that too-low forehead , Mag was handsome enough in her tall , large-boned fashion . Jenny nodded toward me . " This one will take the wine up . " I cried , " But my father ? " " Her ladyship sent down word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , take off your cloak . " Trembling with anger , I took off my cloak , folded it onto one of the several stools standing before the fireplace , and grasped the bottles Mag sullenly held out to me . " Where shall I take them ? " " Up the stairs . " She nodded toward an archway in the opposite corner of the kitchen from the cellar entrance . " To which floor ? " " The first . The top one is used for storage , although in the old days , when Sir James and his first wife were alive , and there were lots of servants . . . But never mind that . Do n't dawdle by the dining hall . Sir Donald and his friends are there . Just keep on until you reach the last door . " As if I would dawdle anywhere , I thought with helpless fury , when my father 's life was slipping away minute by minute . I hurried to the archway in the corner and found myself at the foot of narrow stairs spiraling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere above came a flickering , reddish glow . I rounded the first of the spirals and saw , set in deep embrasures in the curving wall , a row of arrow slits . Above them a torch burned in an iron socket . I followed the spiral upward a few more feet , and then stepped through an open doorway  | into a wide corridor , dimly illuminated by tapers set in widely spaced wall sconces . From a doorway up ahead came boisterous male laughter . I hurried forward , head down , gaze fixed on the narrow strip of carpet , so worn that I could not discern its pattern . That was why I did not see , until I was only a step away from him , that a man lounged against one side of the open doorway . In the corridor near his feet sat a roughcoated deerhound , almost as large as a pony . The man reached out and caught my arm . " Well ! What have we here ? " As I tried to pull away , I looked over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered around a long table , and of a stone wall hung with crossed pistols and swords , glinting in the candlelight . One of the young men , a grin on his face , was moving toward the doorway . Still grasping my arm with one hand , my captor reached out and closed the door . " Now , " he said , " who are you ? A new serving wench ? " His gaze was sweeping my brown linsey dress . " Not by the look of you . " My voice shook . " Let go of me ! " " Now , now , girl . Do you know who I am ? I am Donald Macduveen . " So this was the young laird . He was plump , like his mother , and perhaps two inches taller than I , with a blond peruke set slightly askew , revealing the limp brown hair underneath . I guessed his age to be twenty-three or - four , although the spoiled set of his full mouth made him look younger than that , and the dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go , " I said . " And do n't make me drop this  | wine . Your  --  her ladyship has sent for them . " " Then you are a serving wench . " His tone was sneering , but perhaps my mention of his mother had daunted him a little , because he released my arm . I hurried on down the hall and stopped at a partially open door at its end . From beyond it came a babble of voices . Still grasping the bottles , I knocked with the knuckles of my right hand , but evidently talk and laughter covered the sound , because no one bade me enter . With my shoulder I pushed the door farther open and took a few tentative steps into the room . I had an impression of candlelight and dying firelight , of a table littered with silver drinking vessels and with china plates which bore the remnants of a supper . Around a bird cage which hung between two of the room 's tall windows , a half dozen or more middle-aged , richly dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those windows , like the ones in the dining hall , must overlook the courtyard . Then I saw Lady Macduveen seated beside the dying fire . On her lap was some sort of needlework , perhaps a square of tapestry , in its wooden frame . Beside her stood a tall woman of forty-odd , with elaborately dressed dark hair and a proud , coldly handsome face . " I think , Mrs. MacElvin , that I will work a rose into this corner . . . " Then , suddenly aware of my presence : " Yes ? " " I have brought some wine , your ladyship . " Perhaps my strange accent had caught the attention of the group around the bird cage . I was aware of turning heads and the clatter of someone 's silver wine cup falling to the floor . " Put it on the table . " I placed the bottles on the wine-  | stained cloth and turned away . " Wait , " Lady Macduveen said . " Did you tell me your name ? " I turned back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have given my full name . Or perhaps again something in my manner struck her as unsuitable , because the shadow of a frown touched her placid brow . " Here you will be called Betty . Leave us now , Betty . " At least , I thought , moving toward the door , she would not be calling me Bess . Only my father had ever called me that . I found the corridor empty . The sounds of revelry came muted now from behind the dining hall 's closed door . I hurried past it . Only three more doors , one of them open , between me and the round tower stairs . Soon I would be spooning broth into my father 's mouth . Sudden movement in the darkness just beyond that open door . An arm encircled me , pinning my arms to my side . A hand covered my mouth , its finger biting into my cheeks . I caught a glimpse of Donald Macduveen 's round face . His plump upper lip was lifted at the corners in what was both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the darkened room . I fought , writhing in his grasp and kicking at his fat legs . I worked my lips apart far enough to sink my teeth into his palm . Cursing , he released me momentarily . I lunged toward the doorway , only to feel his hand grasp the shoulder of my dress . I heard a ripping sound , and felt his other arm close around me . Someone 's tall body blocked out the light from the doorway . Someone 's hand grasped the collar of Donald Macduveen 's coat and jerked him into the corridor . I  | found myself leaning against the door jamb , looking dazedly at the two men  --  one young and plump and scarletfaced with rage , the other perhaps ten years older than my father , a tall man with a saturnine face and no peruke on a dark head still untouched with gray . " You puppy , " the tall man said . " You worthless , wenching puppy . " Donald said thickly , " It 's no concern of yours , Clarence MacElvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome woman who had stood looking down at her hostess 's needlework . And , long ago , another woman 's husband ? Yes , surely my father had told me that the beautiful and tragic Arabella had been the bride of a Clarence MacElvin . " You are only a guest here , " Donald was saying . " And after a fortnight you 've worn out your welcome . I 'm master here , and I tell you that to your face . " " Master ? " Clarence MacElvin 's voice was cold . " At the expense of whose purse ? Who was it who , four years ago , kept this roof from being sold over your worthless head ? " After a moment Donald muttered , " It was your brother more than you . " Then , as if aware of the feebleness of his response , he turned and hurried away . The door of the dining hall closed behind him . Clarence MacElvin 's dark gaze fastened on my face . " Who are you ? " Then , as I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name . How is it you are here ? " I owed him an answer . Agonizing as I found the delay , I owed him that . " My father was a servant here as a boy , and so were both his parents . He is very ill now , and with no money . We had no other place to go . " He nodded , no expression in his dark , high cheekboned  | face , and walked away toward the end of the hall . I hurried down to the shadowy kitchen . Jenny must have finished plucking the goose and placed it in the larder , because now she stood stirring the contents of a big iron kettle that hung from a tripod above the hearth 's glowing embers . On the floor in the far corner of the room , on a bed that consisted of a heavy layer of straw , Mag lay beneath a blanket . She was not asleep . I could see the dull gleam of her eyes , watching me over her blanketed shoulder . Thankfully , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now rested on one of the fireside stools . " May I have the broth ? " Her gaze , fixed on my shoulder , reminded me of my ripped dress . She said , " Sir Donald 's work , I 'll warrant . Did n't I tell you to stay away from the dining hall ? " What use to explain what had happened ? " If the broth ? " " In the morning you can put on a dress of Mag 's . You 've nothing fit for a kitchen wench , if what you have on is a sample . And you 'll sleep over there with Mag . I 'll put down another blanket . " Had she no intention of giving me the broth ? Abandoning my efforts at self-control , I cried , " Why do you hate me so ? Why do you hate my father ? " She turned toward me , arms akimbo . " Because his mother followed the Antichrist ! " I realized that she must mean the Pope . " Oh , she did not say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down inside her shift . And many a time I heard her praying to the saints . The saints ! Heathen idols is more like it , what with those statues of them in the Papist churches . Yes , and in the Anglican  | churches too . A Christian needs no saints to stand between him and God , and no priests or bishops , either . " She paused for breath , and then went on , " I 'll warrant Walter Logan is a Papist . It was a poison he must have drawn in with his mother 's milk . And like as not you are a idolater too . " I might have answered that in Southampton I had listened each Sunday to a minister whose creed was probably no less stern than her own , and that my father , if he seldom heard the minister 's sermons , always contributed to his salary . But I would not demean my father and myself to that extent . No , not . even for the broth . But apparently she had vented her spleen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , and held it out to me . With muttered thanks I took it , picked up my folded cloak from the stool , and left her . As I crossed the cobblestones , the steam from the broth reminded me that I had eaten nothing since that morning . And yet I felt no hunger . Light wavered beyond the shed 's doorway . Someone , most probably Angus , had brought a fresh candle . I entered the shed , looked down at my father , and saw instantly that he too would not want the broth . Each breath was a rattle in his chest . His eyes were glazed , and the shape of every bone was discernible beneath the skin of his face . I placed the bowl on a stall rail , and dropped to my knees beside him . He said , " Get me a priest . " So she had been right , that fanatic who presided over the castle kitchen . My thoughts scattered wildly . How could I find a priest in this strange , dark countryside stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even ask about a priest , here in this household where the gentry adhered to the Church of England , and where all the servants , perhaps , shared Jenny 's hatred of Catholics ? " Father ? " He drew a rattling breath . " I 'm dying , Bess . Get me a priest . " Old Angus . He had been kind , and was therefore my only hope . I got to my feet and started out of the shed , so hurriedly that I tripped over the doorsill . It was only by grasping the door frame that I saved myself from pitching to the cobblestones . I stood there for a moment to catch my breath . Across the courtyard , I saw now , Jenny had closed the . kitchen door for the night . A flash and an explosive sound from behind one of those slits in the north tower . Simultaneously , it seemed to me , something struck the side of the shed a foot or so from where I stood , and then fell with a metallic clatter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone fired a pistol ball at me ? I thought of Donald Macduveen 's angerflushed face . But surely he was not that angry , nor that vicious . Perhaps one of his drunken friends , who were still shouting and singing up there behind those lighted windows , had taken one of those pistols down from the wall , gone to the north tower , and fired at random into the courtyard . Still , if the ball had landed a foot or so to the left . . . But it had not , and I had no time to waste more thought on it . I hurried across the courtyard and through the rear archway .  | Through the wide door of a wooden building directly ahead , I could see Angus kneeling beside the coach 's right rear wheel , wiping mud from its spokes with what looked like part of an old shirt . I stepped through the doorway into air redolent of hay and dung and leather . " Angus . " Dimly I was aware of the sound of tethered horses moving restless hooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head and then got laboriously to his feet . Fleetingly I noticed that his eyes were blue and strangely young-looking in his seamed face . " My father is dying . " My throat felt so swollen that I had to force the words out . " He wants a priest . " Pity and dismay came into the blue eyes . " Child ? " " Is n't there a priest somewhere near ? " After a moment he said , in a low voice , " There is Mr. Jameson in Garlaig . If I saddle Bluebell right now , happen I could fetch him here in time he could get back home before daylight . " " He does not want a minister ! " I became aware I was  | twisting my hands together . " He asks for a priest . " His voice sank even lower . " Mr. Jameson is a priest . But where Macduveens and MacElvins are lairds , it has long been wise for a priest to call himself mister . " My agonized doubt must have shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest , lass , even though he wears no vestments and has no parish . Catholics believe that once a man is ordained of God , he has the priestly power until he dies . Even though I am no Papist , I know that much about their faith . Now go back to your father , child . " I turned away . For an unmeasured interval I sat beside my father in the shed . When I had told him that a priest would be with him soon , a look of profound gratitude had come into his eyes . But he had not spoken then , or since . I felt that he was concentrating all the strength that remained to him on staying alive until the priest 's arrival . Eyes fixed on his gray face , I too tried to will that those painful breaths would not cease until I heard the priest 's footsteps . Once , despite my concentration on the labored rise and fall of his chest , another thought intruded . That object which had struck the side of the shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? I went outside . No light shone from the dining hall windows now , but the torch above the courtyard 's rear archway still sent a wavering light over the cobblestones . I knelt , and with flattened palms felt all around the area where the pistol ball had probably fallen . It was not there . Had it ever been there ? Had I , in my distraught state , imagined the sharp explosion of a pistol and the impact of an iron ball against the shed 's side ? Or had someone , while I talked to Angus  | in the stable , come down to the courtyard and retrieved the ball ? I got to my feet and went back to my father . I had been sitting beside him perhaps ten minutes , in silence broken only by that labored breathing , when Angus and a plump , mild-faced man , wearing brown homespun breeches and coat , entered the shed . Angus said , " I have brought Mr. Jameson . " He looked down at my father and then said to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave them alone . " Outside the shed Angus and I moved a few yards away over the cobblestones and then halted . He said gently , " From the look of your father , a coffin will be needed soon . I will ask Kenneth to help . He is a good lad . And his nephew will help too . Call me when you have need of me . " He moved toward the rear archway . I looked up at the black sky . Strange that there was no dawn glimmer . It seemed to me that many hours had passed since , with my father leaning against me , I had entered this courtyard . Footsteps . I turned to see Mr. Jameson 's plump figure moving toward me . He touched my shoulder . " His heart and mind are at ease now , my child . Go to him . " I found my father conscious . He smiled at me , and then closed his eyes . Even though he still breathed with that labored , rattling sound , his face was peaceful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I only knew that suddenly I became aware that his breath had ceased . I placed my ear to his chest . No sound . I kissed his forehead and then looked down at the wasted , peaceful face . I knew that soon grief and loneliness would tear at me . But now all that I felt was a vast emptiness . I rose and left the shed .  | Outside the courtyard 's rear archway I paused . From somewhere up the line of low outbuildings came the sound of hammering . Angus and Kenneth , constructing my father 's coffin . Moving farther away from the courtyard wall , I looked toward the invisible horizon . Still no sign of dawn 's approach . But a star , low in the sky , was shining through the clouds . No , not a star . Some sort of man-made light . As I strained my eyes through the darkness , it seemed to me that I could make out the shape of that many-centuries-old round tower , a deeper black against the black sky . Was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was not wavering torchlight I saw , but rather a steadier , paler gleam , like that of a lantern . And did it shine from the parapet , or through some narrow window in the tower itself ? I could not tell . Even as I looked at it , it disappeared . I heard footsteps , and saw Angus 's tall , lean shape moving toward me . When he was still a few feet away , he halted and asked , " Is he gone , then ? " Still aware of nothing but emptiness , I said , " Yes . " After a moment 's silence he said , " Lass , he can not be buried in consecrated ground . There is not a Catholic graveyard in many miles . True , there is the graveyard beside the kirk in Garlaig , but I fear that your father , a stranger in this place ? " " It does not matter . " Remembering the peace of his face , I felt that his soul would not care where his body rested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave matters to Kenneth and me . There is an empty stall in the stable . The straw is clean . Will you rest there until Kenneth and  | I have finished ? " " Yes , " I said , and turned away . Through the first gray light we moved along the faint path which led across the moor 's spiny gorse and purple heather . Kenneth and Angus walked ahead of me , carrying the roughly made coffin by its rope handles . Far ahead of us and to the left , the ancient round tower rose on its low promontory , its stones dark red in the dawn light . We had walked the better part of an hour when the path began to slant upward toward a grove of juniper and pine . We moved through the trees and into a grassy open space beyond . A sandy-haired young boy I realized must be Kenneth 's nephew stood there , leaning on a shovel beside the open grave . Beyond him I could see a line of gorse bushes . I knew they must mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear the break and withdrawing seethe of each separate wave . When the coffin had been lowered , the two men and the boy stepped back . I moved to the graveside and stood looking down at the hastily made wooden box which held , not my father , but the exhausted body which he had at last been able to escape . I thanked God for that peaceful look on my father 's face , and prayed that his soul was indeed at rest . I turned away then and moved through the screen of gorse . Yes , this was headland , sloping away to a rocky beach about a hundred and fifty feet below . From behind a curtain of offshore mist , gray waves rolled to break foaming on the shore . From behind me , almost drowned out by the waves , came the scraping sound of the shovel . When the scraping ceased , I turned and moved back  | through the gorse bushes . Angus and Kenneth and the boy stood beside the mounded grave . For the first time I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was another low mound , blanketed with coarse grass . Kenneth looked at me , his good-natured little eyes holding a sympathy he evidently did not know how to put into words . Then he nodded and , with his nephew beside him , turned and disappeared through the trees . I said into the silence . " Whose grave is that ? " " A lady 's . She was sister to the old laird , Sir James Macduveen . She died long ago , several years before I came here with the second Lady Macduveen . " " Was she Arabella ? The one who drowned herself only a few months after she married Clarence MacElvin ? " " Yes . Some say she did it because it was Clarence 's younger brother that she loved . I do not know , since it was before my time here . But anyway , the poor lady could not be buried in consecrated ground , not when she had taken her own life . I hear there were those who said she should be buried at the crossroads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Macduveens or the MacElvins would stand for that , so she was buried here . " I walked over to the unmarked grave of Arabella Macduveen MacElvin . Arabella who , in my father 's lie about his origins , had been his aunt , and therefore my greataunt . Had he confessed that lie , among his other sins and follies , to the priest ? Whether he had or not , he must have felt shriven of it , or he would not have died with that look on his face . Angus had walked over to stand beside me . Reaching inside his shirt , he brought out my father 's purse . " This is yours now .  | Opening it , I spilled a few coins into my hand , and saw that they added up to two shillings , six pence . As my left hand funneled them back into the leather pouch , he asked , " What will you do now ? " " What can I do , except work for my keep ? " Those strangely young eyes studied my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no pity . You do not have need of it . You have a brave heart and a pleasing face . That will serve you in place of silver in your purse . " Who else had said something like that to me ? Oh , yes , Charles Edward , standing tattered and cheerful in the bracken . " Will you come back with me now , child ? " Back to the castle and placidly selfish Lady Macduveen and her loose-lipped son . Back to the cavernous kitchen and fanatical Jenny and sullen-faced Mag . At the very thought I felt tired , so tired that I feared I would sway on my feet . " Leave me here . I must sleep for a little while . " " Aye , that would be best . Nothing will harm you here . " His tall form disappeared through the trees . I walked back toward my father 's grave and lay down a few feet from it , my cloak wrapped tightly around me . Somewhere among the trees a bird began to sing . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warble reminded me of the tawny-breasted bluebirds who came to eastern Long Island each spring to build their nests in hollow trees . That gentle sound was the last I heard before exhaustion overcame me and I slept .  | One afternoon almost three months later I stood at the parapet of the castle 's northern tower , gazing across the strait 's blue waters toward the grape-purple mountains of Skye . Sun fell warm on my face and my forearms . I had rolled to the elbow the much-too-long sleeves of the faded blue homespun dress which Mag , at jenny 's order , had sullenly bestowed upon me . And as I stood there , breathing air that smelled of sea and sun-warmed heather , I was happy . Most would say I had little reason to be . I was still utterly alone in the world . For my keep , and a promised two pounds a year , I worked hard from first light until after Gerald , the aged footman Lady Macduveen had brought to the castle years before , carried the gentry 's dinner dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald had guests staying with them , as they frequently did , I worked even longer hours , helping the two elderly chambermaids sweep and dust and change bed linen . What was more , I had no real reason to hope that my situation would improve .  | But when one is eighteen , it is almost impossible not to hope . At eighteen , when the blood runs warm and swift through the veins , often it is happiness just to be alive . Too , working under Jenny 's supervision had proved less galling than I had feared . In my first raw grief I had even welcomed familiar tasks like candlemaking and roasting fowl on the spit . And I had welcomed the necessity to learn new skills , such as baking bannocks on a griddle . During those first few days , as I carried water from the courtyard well or mixed batter for bannocks , I sometimes saw reluctant approval in Jenny 's small gray eyes . On the third morning , as she and Mag and I sat on the fireplace stools plucking grouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You are a puny-appearing lass . But I vow you seem almost as strong as this great gawk Mag here , and much more quick . " Seeing the sullen fury in Mag 's dark eyes . I wished that Jenny had saved her grudging praise until she and I were alone . It was daily association with Mag that I found hardest to bear  --  harder than the long hours of toil , and Jenny 's often rough tongue , and the sneering look Donald Macduveen gave me on those rare occasions when I met him in the castle corridor . For most of my first week here I reluctantly had gone to bed beside Mag in that straw-strewn corner of the kitchen . Then one night I awoke with a start . On her own blanket , not two feet from mine , Mag sat staring down at me . Moonlight coming through the kitchen 's one window shone on her face , broad and pale in its frame of coarse black hair , and gave her dark eyes a cold gleam . My stomach knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat there , eyes fastened on my sleeping face ?  | I kept my voice low , so as not to waken Jenny , over there on her pallet beside the banked fire . " What are you doing ? " Her lips curved in a slow smile . " Watching you . What is the harm in that ? " My anger stirred . Why was she so hostile ? Because I was a stranger ? Because , the first night I spent in this kitchen , I had betrayed my reluctance to sleep in my shift , as she and Jenny did ? Or was it because it had been I , rather than she , who had received , and violently rejected , the young laird 's amorous attentions ? I said sharply , " Well , stop it . If you do n't , in the morning I 'll tell Jenny . " She waited several seconds , apparently to convey that she was not daunted by my threat , and then lay down . The next day , giving no reason , I asked Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So your ladyship wants her own chamber , does she ? Maybe you want to sleep upstairs with the gentry . " " I was hoping I might take one of the huts . " The courtyard huts , I had learned , dated from the days when Bowain Castle had at times had to withstand enemy attack . The wooden huts along one wall had housed cattle hastily driven in from the moors , and pigs and chicken and geese . The stone building along the opposite wall had included , not just the kitchen , but a stable for horses , a carpenter shop , and a smithy . Jenny shrugged . " If you will clean it out , you can use the stone hut at the far end . Lady Macduveen and Sir Donald get their shoes from Glasgow now . But time was , in Sir James 's day , that old Walter Logan made shoes for the gentry and the servants too . "  | Old Walter Logan , my grandfather . " Of course , there 's a hole in the roof . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the rain . And come winter , you 'll be glad enough to sleep in here with Mag and me , I 'll warrant . " That afternoon when I was free from the kitchen for a few hours , I cleaned the cobbler 's hut of its dirt and cobwebs and its nests , made of plant fibers and bits of paper and cloth , in which many generations of field mice must have nurtured their young . In one corner , well away from the gaping hole in the roof , I spread the clean straw Angus had brought from the stable , and placed my two blankets upon it . That night , when my after-supper chores were finished , I left the kitchen and walked toward the cobbler 's hut . Then , so that I could anticipate for a while longer the moment when I would enter the lovely solitude of my new home , I moved through the courtyard 's rear archway . Beyond the last of the line of outbuildings , I stopped at the moor 's edge and looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw a distant gleam in the darkness , far too low to be a star . I heard footsteps . Stopping beside me , Angus said , " Old Murdock must be wakeful tonight . " " Murdock ? " " He keeps the Macduveen falcons in the tower . A mute , Murdock is , although he hears well enough for a man of eighty . " " Does he live alone there ? " " Aye . Even though Murdock can not abide women , they say that many years ago he had a wife and stepdaughter . But they are long since dead . "  | I thought of the old man alone in that ancient tower , hearing the falcons rustle on their perch , but no human voice , not even his own . " Does anyone fly the falcons ? " " Sir James used to . But the young laird seldom does , not even when he is here , and he is often away . " I said good night to Angus then , and went to the cobbler 's hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed me , I put on my nightdress , a garment which it seemed to me I had stitched many years ago and in another world , instead of last winter in that snug little house on Job 's Lane . I lay down on the straw pallet and blew out the candle . Gradually I was able to make out , by the starlight which fell through the hole in the roof , the room 's one piece of furniture . It was my grandfather 's cobbler 's bench , over there beside the portmanteau and hand trunk . I had wanted to keep it here , even though one leg was broken . For a long while I lay awake , wondering what my grandfather had been like , and luxuriating in my solitude . My solitary afternoon hours seemed equally blessed . In all sorts of weather  --  and it was a rare day that passed without periods of fog or rain  --  I roamed across the moors . Often I visited my father 's grave , and then moved to the headland 's edge to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glens , where willows and scarletberried rowan trees bordered rushing streams , and the cool air had a ferny fragrance . One lowering day I walked five miles to the village of Garlaig , a cluster of thatched stone huts around the stone kirk . In its churchyard I found the graves of , my grandparents , Walter and Sara Logan . According to the dates on their gravestones , ' my grandfather had died when my  | father was twelve . My grandmother had lived until a year before my father had run away to fight in the Battle of Preston . As I lingered there the sexton , a thin little man of sixty odd , with bright inquisitive blue eyes under bushy brows , came out of the kirk and walked toward me . He said , looking at the gravestones , " Were they kin of yours ? " " My grandparents . " I paused . " Do you know what they died of ? " " I do . I was not sexton here then , but it is in the parish record . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died five years apart . " Lung fever . The scourge of the Gaels , my father had called it . " Lung fever has taken many who served at Bowain Castle . " With a kind of ghoulish melancholy , he showed me the graves of the wife and stepdaughter of Murdock , the falcon keeper . " First the mother went , and six months later the daughter . " He pointed out the graves of Kenneth 's parents . " Dead within a year of one another , and Kenneth still too young to be anything but stableboy . " To my surprise , since she had not mentioned ever being married , he showed me the grave of Jenny 's husband . " It was not lung fever that took this one . It was the drink . Died raving mad , they say . " As I bade the sexton good-bye and turned away , I reflected that any man married to Jenny might have ended in a drunkard 's grave . It was on my way back from Garlaig that day that I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile along the road , under rapidly thickening clouds , when the first , isolated drops made small craters in the dust . With no more warning than that , the rain came in a  | wind-driven flood that soon had me soaked to the skin and gasping for breath . Even if I cut across the moors , I would not reach the kitchen in time to begin my late afternoon and evening tasks , not with the hem of my cloak heavy with mud and the wind blowing so hard that I had to force my way against it . I was about to turn back to the kirk to wait out the storm when I looked to my left and saw , looming through the rain curtain , the ancient round tower on its low promontory . Turning off the road , I waded up the slope through sodden heather . As I climbed the promontory , I saw that a rough-coated Highland pony , head dropping under the downpour , stood in a wooden-railed pen beside the tower 's rounded wall . I pounded on the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape of wood on wood , and knew that he was sliding back the bar . I found myself looking into a wrinkled , white-bearded face on almost the same level as my own . Over his shoulder , by gray light that filtered through arrow slits , I could see the tethered birds moving restlessly on their long perch , some hooded , some with yellow eyes gleaming dully . I smiled at the old man and said , " Could I wait here until the ? " Both his hands shot out and shoved my shoulders so violently that I almost fell . Stepping out into the rain , he seized my arm with one bony hand and shook it . He drew the forefinger of his other hand across his throat , and then pointed in the direction of the castle . His meaning was plain . If I , a loathed female , tried to invade his sanctuary again , he would kill me . The threat was absurd . He was only a little taller than  | I , perhaps only a few pounds heavier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the soundless workings of his mouth were so grotesque , that I felt chilled by more than the rain . I turned away and , head down , with the wind whipping my cloak , walked toward the castle . Even though the downpour dwindled and then ceased before I was halfway there , I arrived in the kitchen drenched and muddied . I stood before the hearth in my shift , hands extended to the warming blaze , while Jenny made a withering speech about addlepates who wander in the rain , leaving others to make supper and do the washing-up . But seldom that summer had the weather been that harsh . Through mist and light rain and sunlight I had walked the moors and made my way up narrow glens . I had felt a growing love for this land I had never seen until a few weeks before . No , more than love ; an eerie sense that I had always belonged here . Sometimes , in a shadowed glen , I had a sense that this same moss had been springy beneath my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall cool against my face and arms . And , as I have said , much of the time I was happy . Today I had not finished my work before stealing a bit of sunlight and freedom . A number of house guests , including Clarence MacElvin and his handsome wife , had arrived that morning . Consequently I 'd had to help Sally and Peg , the chambermaids , change bed linens . Arms full of sheets I intended to take down for Mag and me to launder , I moved along the hall toward the stairs spiraling down through the north tower . Once on the landing , I succumbed to temptation . It was such a lovely day , with fat little white clouds floating in a serene blue sky . Surely  | I could spend a few minutes atop the north tower . And since these stairs were used only by servants , surely it would be all right to leave the linen here on the stone landing . I went up the stairs , paused for a moment at the next landing to look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then continued up a shorter flight to a landing beneath the tower 's roof . From there an iron ladder slanted upward to a trap door . When the castle was built , that door must have been some ponderous affair of stone or iron . But sometime during the centuries since , undoubtedly to admit light down the stairwell , it had been replaced by a hatch door of glass , its two halves secured by a hasp with an iron pin through it . I climbed the ladder , undid the hasp , and pushed the two halves of the door back until they rested on their hinges . Then I stepped out into sunlight and warm wind . Now , as I stood at the parapet , my gaze strayed downward to that cowshed where my father had died . As always at the sight of it , I felt not only a stir of that old angry grief over the manner of his death , but a lingering , puzzled anxiety . Had someone fired at me that night ? Old Angus thought not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned to the castle from the first of my many late afternoon visits to my father 's grave . The stable door had been open . At Angus 's invitation I had gone inside and sat down on the three-legged stool he offered . It was there , with motes of dust and hay moving sluggishly in sunbeams slanting through cracks in the stable wall , that I told him of the pistol ball striking the cowshed , and of my failure to find it on the cobblestones either that night or when I returned to the castle late the  | next day after my exhausted sleep beside my father 's grave . " If the young laird fired that pistol , " Angus said , " he meant not to hit you , but only to frighten , else you would be dead now , lass . Drink will ruin his hand and eye in time , but now he is still a marksman . I know , because I have set up targets for him on the moor . " Probably , he had gone on to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sir Donald 's drunken friends . It had happened before during such rowdy gatherings . " When the young scapegrace , whoever he was , saw that he had almost hit someone , he was afraid you would complain to her ladyship about it , and show her the pistol ball to give your story credit . And so he himself slipped down to the courtyard and took it . I 'll warrant that was the way of it . " I had wanted to believe so . Since I had little choice but to stay in this place , or beg for my bread along the road , I wanted to believe that a drunken stranger had fired a pistol at random . Certainly I did not want to believe that it had been fired in deadly malice by Donald Macduveen , or by that saturnine-faced man who had dragged Donald away from me , or by Jenny , or Mag , or anyone else here . Dismissing the thought of those first nightmarish hours at Bowain Castle , I lifted my gaze from the courtyard and looked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shadow had touched a jagged peak , turning it from purple to deep blue . Had Charles Edward Stuart doubled back to hide somewhere over there among those crags ? He had been on Skye , people said , in July . When the hunters drew close , a young woman named Flora MacDonald had  | helped him to escape back to the mainland by dressing him in woman 's clothing and passing him off as her Irish maid , Betty Burke . ( Flora MacDonald was said to be handsome . Had she appeared so , I wondered , in Charles Edward 's eyes ? ) Unless he had escaped to France within the last few days , or been taken prisoner , he was still somewhere here in the Highlands , a hunted quarry doubling and redoubling on his trail while all the hounds  --  English soldiers , local militiamen , English warships sailing up and down Loch Ness and among the Western Isles  --  bayed futilely after him . That he was still at large had seemed to me inexplicable , until a conversation I had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and I knelt at the hearth baking bannocks and Mag swept the stone floor , Kenneth had come in to warm his hands at the hearth . English warships , he reported , had been on a wild-goose chase up to the outermost of the Western Isles , where it had been reported that Charles Edward was hiding . Instead of a prince , they had found a handful of bewildered men and women and children , subsisting miserably on the rocky isle with their goats and cattle , and so isolated from the rest of the world that they had never heard of King George , let alone Charles Edward Stuart . I said , " But how is it they have not found him some-place ? " " Because everywhere he finds friends . They give him food and shelter , and warn him when it is best to move on , " Jenny said , and then added , " Thank the merciful Lord . " I was so startled that I almost dropped the griddle . " But  | he is a Catholic ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cess to those who follow him because he is a Papist . But he is a Scot , and the son of a rightful king , and the grandson of a crowned king . Besides , we Dissenters are strong enough to withstand any king , be he Catholic or Church of England . " Would I ever , I wondered , understand the Scottish and their contradictory loyalties ? I said , " Charles Edward did not strike me as a man who would be intolerant in religious matters . " Jenny and Kenneth stared at me . Behind me , the sound of Mag 's sweeping stopped . Jenny asked , " What would you know of such things ? " My chance meeting with Charles had been many weeks before . Surely it would do no harm to talk of it now . " Because I talked with him , " I said , and described that daybreak encounter there by the river 's bank . Jenny said , " They say he is still of good heart . But surely he must grieve over the sorrows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunlight atop the north tower , I thought of those sorrows . Here on Macduveen land , all was peaceful . But in Inverness , it was said , the jail was filled to suffocation with suspected Jacobite sympathizers and with defeated survivors of Culloden , many of them with untended wounds . So were the holds of prison ships anchored in Loch Ness and Moray Firth , awaiting orders to sail their wretched cargo to London for trial and for almost inevitable hanging , drawing , and quartering . And throughout the Highlands , except on lands owned by Scottish adherents of the London government , bands of soldiers roamed  --  hanging , shooting , raping . They went  | deep into the glens to burn huts , confiscate small stores of food , and drive off scrawny Highland cattle for sale to Lowland and English farmers , leaving the survivors of their raids to find what shelter they could in hillside caves . A line of dark clouds had formed above Skye 's mountains now . Soon they would sweep over the strait to blot out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ladder , and closed and secured the trap door . I descended the first spiral of stone steps , glanced briefly along the corridor between rooms used only for storage , and started down the second flight . I was aware of sudden movement behind me . Before I could turn my head , something shoved me violently between the shoulder blades . I experienced that distorted time sense that comes with shock . It seemed to me that I hung in midair , body slanted forward , for at least two seconds before I toppled onto the stairs and began to slide . Time speeded up then . I clutched futilely at the smooth , curving walls , trying to stop my headfirst descent to that stone landing below . With a suddenness that jarred every bone in my body , my fall was checked . I lay there with head and shoulders deep in a smothering softness .  | It took me several seconds to realize that I was still alive and could move . I got to hands and knees and then , shakily , to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed linen which had saved my life . Had the person who rushed at me from that dim corridor known that I had left a pile of sheets here ? If so , his attack had been designed to shock and terrify , not to kill . And surely he must have been aware of the linen , if he had climbed up these stairs . But what if he had not ? What if someone in the courtyard , or in the row of outbuildings behind it , or on the moor sloping down from the castle 's eastern wall , had seen me up there on the tower roof , and had slipped up the stairs through the other tower , the stairs reserved for gen-try ? The gentry . I thought of Donald Macduveen , dragging me into his darkened bedchamber that first night . I thought of the pistol ball striking the wall of that shed where my father lay dying . Now I was sure that it had not been one of his drunken friends who had fired that pistol .  | It had been Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rage . Did he , that fat wastrel , think he was some fourteenth-century baron , with the right to ravish any peasant girl who took his eye , and the right to terrorize her if she successfully resisted ? If so , it was time someone told him of his error . For a moment I was checked by the thought that if anyone was to give Sir Donald his comeuppance , it had best be someone in a less precarious situation than myself , a girl possessed of only two shillings , six pence . He was laird here . He had the legal right to drive me , not only from under his roof , but across the border of Macduveen lands , miles beyond the village of Garlaig . But I did not think that his mother , placid and self-centered as she was , would allow him to do that . And besides , I was too angry not to risk it . I smoothed my hair and my dress , reflecting as I did so that there must be bruises on my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved across the threshold into the carpeted corridor . Through the partially opened door at the end of the hall , the one that led to Lady Macduveen 's sitting room and bedchamber , I could hear animated talk and laughter . I went to the door of Donald Macduveen 's room and knocked . For several seconds there was no answer . Had he joined his mother and her guests ? Was he still in the corridor above ? Or was he in his room , still breathless from his swift retreat down the other stairs and along this corridor ? At last he called out , " Who is there ? " I said loudly , " Elizabeth Logan . " Several more seconds of silence . Then he opened the door , his round face expressionless above a dressing robe  | of silk tartan . " What do you want ? " To my annoyance , my voice shook . " I want to know why you pushed me down the staircase . " He said , with seeming astonishment , " Push you ! Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His retort was so unexpected that for a moment I was speechless . Then I said , with fury , " Not touch me ! Why , my first night here ? " " That was then . Now is now . " His scornful gaze dropped from my face to my hands . " If I had a taste for sun-browned wenches with lobster-red hands , I could find dozens . " I knew that it was his malice that spoke , and yet I felt a humiliated impulse to hide my hands behind my skirt . It was true that they were red and chapped . In the Job 's Lane house I had kept a mixture of rosewater and glycerine in the kitchen . But here I had not the ingredients for such a lotion , nor would I have wanted to use it under Mag and Jenny 's scornful gaze . And it was true that I had given little thought to my complexion as I washed clothes in the courtyard and , during my free afternoon hours , wandered through sun and rain over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leghorn straw , which my father had bought for me in Boston . But I would have looked absurd , a kitchenmaid wearing a hat . And besides , the man whom I had hoped would always find me pleasing to look at was an ocean away . Nevertheless , I found that I still had vanity  --  vanity tender enough to be wounded by Donald Macduveen 's sneer . I said thickly , " Never mind about my face and hands . I think you pushed me down those stairs . " " Probably no one pushed you . Probably you tripped .  | Unless . . . " A slow smile spread over his face . " Unless it was Belzebub who pushed you . He likes to send people sprawling . " Belzebub , that giant deerhound of his . The beast seemed to roam wherever he chose . Often I had seen him padding along this corridor . Once in the courtyard he had come up behind me as I was carrying water from the well , and thrust his nose into one of the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cobblestones . I began to feel doubt . It was true that I had not heard footsteps before I hurtled down those stairs . Rather I had had just a sense of movement behind me . Had my assailant been a human moving on stocking feet , or Belzebub , the click of his claws inaudible over the rush-strewn stones of that upper corridor ? Smiling now , the laird of Bowain Castle stepped past me , faced the doorway to the southern tower , and gave a high-pitched whistle . Within seconds the huge , roughcoated animal emerged from the doorway and trotted toward us . He sniffed at my gown and then went into his master 's room . I said , in that shaking voice , " If it was the dog , then you must have been up there too . You signaled him to do it . " Donald seemed genuinely amused . " A prankster like Belzebub needs no signals . And do you think I would spend my time training him to push kitchen wenches down stairs ? " He went into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there for a moment , my heart still pounding with anger , not just because of that plunge down through the north tower , but because of his sneer at my appearance . Had I become so unappealing ? I did not know . My only  | mirror was a small one in my portmanteau , and I had not bothered to use it for weeks . True , when I helped Nan and Sally in the castle bedchambers , I sometimes caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror . But even if I had cared to risk their derision by pausing to inspect my image , I would not have done so . Always I was too resentful of those extra tasks , and too intent upon hurrying through them so that I could enjoy what was left of my afternoon freedom . I moved away down the corridor and then , just before I reached the north tower entrance , halted at a closed door . That room , the elderly chambermaids had told me , was never used . Still , it might contain a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and then turned with a grating sound . I slipped into the room and closed the door behind me . Light that came through the tattered remains of yellow silk draperies showed me why this room was never used . It would have taken days to render it fit for a guest . Dust lay thick upon the torn and sagging yellow brocade canopy of the bed , and on its elaborately carved dark posts . On the carpet the dust was so thick that I could not discern its pattern . And a huge spiderweb , its dark weaver scuttling along one of its strands , hung between a bedpost and the tall back of an armchair , its upholstered seat so gray with dust that it might have been any color at all . A small hearth in the far wall still held the ashes of a longdead fire . As I stood there in the silence , I felt an odd stilling of all my senses . Then it came to me , just as it did at times in a glen murmurous with running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some life lost to conscious memory I  | had known this room . Arabella 's room , I thought . Arabella , who had sinned the unpardonable sin of self-murder . Just as her drowned body had been deemed unfit to lie with those of shriven Christians , so the room where she had slept would be left to the dust and the spiders . A gilt framed mirror hung on the wall above a narrow table , its legs hidden by a tattered , dusty skirt of some indiscernible pattern . Before the table stood a little chair of dark wood , graceful and feminine despite its coating of dust . Aware that I must be leaving footprints , I crossed the room . The mirror 's surface was dusty and flyspecked . With the lower edge of the tattered drapery , I cleaned the glass 's surface and then , bending slightly , looked at my reflection . It was true that my hair , often unprotected even by a shawl when I roamed the countryside , now had streaks bleached to a lighter yellow . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that there was a sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of my nose . But my skin could not be called " sun-browned . " Rather the sun had altered it to a shade resembling that of pale gold . My eyes under my sun-bleached brows were as blue as ever , and my mouth if anything was pinker than in the days when I used to go about the streets of Southampton , shawled or bonneted , and wearing a dress that bore no stain of kitchen grease . I no longer looked like the daughter of a man who knew Latin and Greek . But neither had I turned into the leathery hag that Donald Macduveen 's words had conjured up . I lingered for another moment , inspecting a red streak along my jaw that no doubt soon  | would be a bruise , and then moved to the door . Hand on the iron knob , I took a last look around the room , trying to picture Arabella asleep beneath that now tattered canopy , or standing by the window with its view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , since I had no idea whether she had been dark or fair , tall or short . Lady Macduveen had come to Bowain Castle several years after Arabella 's death . Of all the servants in the castle only Jenny and Kenneth had been here when Arabella was alive , and Kenneth had been only a child . When I once questioned him about her , all he could recall was that he had considered her " bonnie , " and that when his father was dying and his mother already ill , she had brought food and extra blankets to their croft . As for Jenny , she had flatly refused to discuss the young woman who , thirty-one years before , had doomed herself " to eternal hellfire . " I left the room , crossed the corridor , and stood looking at two portraits which hung there on the wall . The artist had depicted Sir James Macduveen as a grave-looking young man of about twenty-five , brown-haired , and with a firm , unsmiling mouth . His brother Malcolm 's portrait must have been painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because in it he appeared to be a youth of about twenty , also brown-haired , but with a smile that held a hint of lighthearted recklessness . Surely Arabella 's portrait must have hung beside those of her brothers at one time . Probably it had been destroyed after her suicide , or hidden away up there in one of those rooms used for storage . I went to the north tower , gathered up the pile of linen , and descended to the kitchen . Mag , seated on a stool with a knife in one hand and a  | turnip in the other , raised her head to look at me . Jenny turned away from the hearth and put her hands on her hips . " So it is her ladyship , is it ? And what has her ladyship been doing above all this time ? " Then , in a different tone : " What happened to your face ? " I dropped the linen into the deep wooden handcart which stood beside the hearth . " Someone  --  somethingpushed me down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Donald 's . " Mag gave a snort of laughter . Jenny looked at me with that strange , closed expression I had often seen on her broad face . " This seems an unlucky place for you . First a pistol ball almost strikes you . And now you come near to breaking your neck on the stairs . " Angus , not I , had told her about the pistol ball . Twice before now she had referred to it . " Perhaps it would be best , " she said , " that you find work elsewhere . " That might have been advice . It might have been a taunt or a veiled threat . Her flat tone made it impossible to be sure . I looked at her , wondering not for the first time how she really regarded me . Sometimes , as now , I felt that in spite of her grudging appreciation of my work , her hostility toward me , the granddaughter of that secret Papist , Sara Logan , had modified itself not one whit . As I drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am sure Jenny considered a saucy tone , " I will go somewhere else if I choose to . " It was an idle boast , of course . Where could I go ? No one in Garlaig was rich enough to hire a servant . Two shillings , six pence would not buy my way to Inverness , where I might find work . And I would have to be desperate indeed before I set out to make my way on foot  | through a Scotland filled with roving bands of soldiers , many of whom seemed to feel that they could do as they liked with any defenseless man or woman they found . Out in the courtyard I drew the cart to the big wooden washtub sitting beside the well , and then seized the windlass to lower the bucket . I had a distinct sense of someone 's eyes upon me . Hand dropping away from the windlass , I turned and looked up at the castle 's rear wall . A dark-haired man stood at one of the long windows looking down at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first I thought he was Clarence MacElvin . But no . He appeared shorter , and somewhat younger than the man who had grasped Donald Macduveen 's coat collar and hauled him out into the corridor . Probably he was Clarence MacElvin 's younger brother , the one whom , it was said , Arabella Macduveen would have preferred to marry . The man turned away and disappeared . Grasping the windlass , I lowered the bucket into the well .  | The Macduveens ' guests left late the next afternoon . I saw them leave . Returning from a solitary two hours on the moor , I paused just outside the courtyard 's rear archway . A coach was drawn up in the entrance tunnel . As I watched , the aged footman handed Clarence MacElvin 's handsome brunette wife into the coach , then a plump lady of fifty-odd with graying red hair , then Clarence MacElvin , and then the man who had looked down at me from the window above the courtyard . Jenny had confirmed my guess that he was Clarence 's younger brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that snorting laugh of hers , had added a bit of information about the younger MacElvin 's wife . She was " daft " about her husband , even though they had been married for almost thirty years , and " jealous as a witch . " The balmy weather broke that night . I awoke at first light , feeling chilled , and saw a mixture of rain and sleet pelting through the broken roof . For three days the weather was so bad that each afternoon , after a too-brief outing on the moor , I returned reluctantly to sit by the  | kitchen hearth until it was time for my evening tasks . I still slept in the hut , under my cloak as well as an additional blanket , smelling of horse , which Angus had supplied . ( Jenny , affronted by my stubborn desire for privacy , had refused to ask the upstairs servants to give me a blanket from the store of household bedding . ) But soon , I knew , the cold would drive me out of the hut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mending the roof . Through the long winter I would not only spend my working hours with the often-censorious Jenny and the always-hostile Mag . At night I would lie in the kitchen corner aware of Mag only a few feet away , perhaps awake and entertaining God only knew what thoughts in that brain behind the too-low forehead . On her privileged spot before the hearth , Jenny would make the cavernous kitchen resound with her snores . One morning I awoke to see that the patch of sunrise sky revealed by the broken roof was clear . What was more , the air seemed a little warmer than it had for several days . I had begun to dress when I saw that someone had slipped a folded sheet of paper under the door . Incredulously  --  for who in this place could have written to me ? ? I picked it up and unfolded it . The note , written in a strong masculine hand , set my pulses to racing . It read : Elisabeth , If you recal meating a new friend one daybrake last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? We nede bred , chees , meat . Brandey if possible . We are in Bowain Wood . Enter wood at stone cross . Whair path branches go to left . One of us will meat you . If you can not bring brandey , wine will do . Come at dusk . Your svt. , E. C.  | So after all these months , and all the perils and hardships he must have endured , he had remembered my name , and that my father and I were bound for Bowain Castle . But it was the bad spelling , more than the use of my name , which convinced me of the note 's genuineness . Angus had told me that the Prince was said to speak three languages  --  Italian , French , and English  --  and to be unable to spell in any of them . As to why he was now hiding on Macduveen lands , I had no idea . When I saw him , I would ask him . Because of a certainty I intended to go to him , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust the note down the bodice of my dress , and went to the kitchen . By midmorning , I saw that I would not have to wait until dusk to go to Bowain Wood . Undoubtedly Charles Edward had wanted me to come there at an hour when there was less chance of my being observed . But now heavy fog had rolled across the strait to the mainland , and settled down in the almost windless air . For once I was glad that the morning had not kept its bright promises . Far better that I leave at my usual midafternoon hour , rather than absent myself from my evening tasks , and thus have to make up some explanation for an irate Jenny upon my return . A little past three that afternoon I moved through the dense fog blanketing the moorland which sloped down from the castle 's front wall . To anyone watching from a window , I must long since have been swallowed up by the gray smother . No one would know which direction I took . The shawl-wrapped bundle of provisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak , I now  | carried in my hand . It had been easy to assemble those provisions . When Gerald appeared in the kitchen to take up the wine for Lady Macduveen and Sir Donald 's dinner , I had volunteered to fetch it from the cellar . Along with the wine , I had brought up a bottle of brandy , and hidden it behind the churn in the larder . During the next hour , taking advantage of moments when I was observed by neither Jenny nor Mag , I added a round loaf of bread , cheese , and a joint of mutton to my hidden hoard . Jenny would miss the mutton , if not the bread and cheese , but that did not matter . She would blame it on Belzebub , who more than once had invaded the kitchen to make off with a joint or a fowl . Shortly before three , when the washing-up had been done and Jenny and Mag stood gossiping with Kenneth at the courtyard well , I hastily wrapped the provisions in one of the muslin cloths used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak , I had sauntered back to my stone hut . There , before leaving the castle by the courtyard 's rear archway , I had made the bundle stouter by wrapping it in a red woolen shawl from the hand trunk . I had reached the road now . I turned left . With a sense that I walked inside a little hollow scooped out of the fog , which moved along with me , I walked two miles . Then I saw , at the right-hand side of the road , the ancient stone cross which , some people said , had been placed there nearly a thousand years ago by Irish missionaries from the island of Iona . A few yards beyond it lay the entrance to the path into Bowain Wood . Momentarily I hesitated . None of my wanderings had taken me into that wood . It was not that I had believed that rascally carter 's story about the wolves . The very  | slyness in his voice told me that he had hoped to impose upon my gullibility as a newcomer . Beside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Highlands had been seen  --  and shot by a sheepherder  --  more than twenty years before . Rather it was that , when out of doors , I like to be able to look up and see clouds or sunlight . Even in the narrowest of glens there was always a ribbon of sky overhead . But in that dense wood I would be moving beneath a many-layered canopy of leaves and branches . I did find the grayness much darker there among the interlaced trees . All around me moisture dripped from branches onto dead leaves , with a pattering sound which resembled that of light rain . Now and then I caught a whiff of acrid peat smoke . Was the fire in some crofter 's hut beyond the woods ? Or had the fugitive and his friends risked kindling a fire against the gray chill ? Here was the branching path . I set down my bundle , took the note from the bosom of my dress , and made sure that I was to take the path bearing to the left . I picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peat smoke was stronger now . Yes , surely the fire was somewhere here in the woods . Through the drip of moisture I could hear something else  --  a faint trickling sound , as of sluggishly moving water . Probably , just beyond that bend in the path , I would find a bridge spanning a shallow stream , its course half choked by dead leaves and fallen branches . I turned the bend . As yet I could see no bridge , although the trickling sound , oddly diffused now , seemed louder . But then , dense fog plays strange tricks with sound . I went on for a yard or so , over ground that sloped gently downward .  | And then my right foot , stepping forward , plunged halfway to the knee into a viscous coldness . Thrown off balance , I fell forward . My arms , which I instinctively thrust out in front of me to break the force of my fall , went elbow-deep into that black , ill-smelling substance . Somehow I pulled my arms free and stood erect , aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had blundered into a bog , I realized now , and that trickling sound was made by sluggish streamlets cutting channels into the mire . I turned and , with the mire sucking at my feet , tried to get back onto solid ground . But apparently , confused by the fog and my own panic , I had moved in the wrong direction , because after four laborious steps I was still in that fetid softness , and at each step I had sunk deeper . I forced myself to stand still . Sunk in that black muck to well over the knees now , I threw back my head and screamed again and again .  | There was no sound except my own screams and , when I paused for breath , the slow trickle of the streamlets . Charles Edward was not in these woods . No one was . The note luring me into this bog had been a murderous hoax . And I was going to die , sinking deeper and deeper into this filthy stuff until it choked my mouth and nostrils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to free my legs , groping wildly about me with my hands in hope of touching firm earth or some such solid object as a fallen tree trunk . I heard the muffled pound of running feet . A man 's shape loomed dimly through the mist , and a voice with a rich Scottish burr called , " You , there ! Stop thrashing about . You will only sink deeper . " I heard the crack of a branch parting from a tree . The branch 's leafy end struck the surface of the bog so close to me that leaves brushed my face . My hands , groping through twigs , found the branch 's central stem , roughbarked and perhaps three inches in circumference , and fastened around it . I felt my rescuer begin to pull . My legs  | came free with a sucking sound . On my stomach , and holding my head above the soft , ill-smelling earth , I was drawn to solid ground . Hands lifted me to my feet . As I stood there , heart still pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lass ! " I looked into a sandy-bearded , vaguely familiar face . After a second or two I recognized him . His had been one of the faces looking down at me when I awoke beside the riverbank that morning last June . He must have recognized me at almost the same moment , because he asked , in a voice rough with suspicion , " What are you doing here ? " My screams had left my throat feeling raw . " I received a note . It was signed with Charles Edward 's initials , and ? " " That is a lie ! The Prince has sent no note . " From the dismay that immediately crossed his face , I knew that he wished he had made some less revealing reply . " I know , " I said . " But I thought it was from him . " I reached inside the bosom of my dress . Yes , the folded paper was still there . With muddy fingers I extended the note to him . " I do not know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note inside my dress . " It told me to bring food and drink to Bowain Wood . It said to go to the left where the path branched . " " He sent you no note . But now that you are here , what the de'il am I to do with you ? " I had the feeling that his sense of dilemna was so strong that he wished he had left me in the bog . " Come on , " he said finally . " Walk ahead of me . And do n't try to run for it . " I felt an impulse toward hysterical laughter . Even if I had wanted to , how could I , my clothing weighted with  | muck , hope to outdistance him ? We moved back to where the path branched , and took the right-hand turning . Still walking ahead of my rescuer , I turned one bend in the path , then another . Up ahead a tall , striding figure took shape in the mist . He halted in front of me . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , the **26;966;TOOLONG of Mary Queen of Scots , still with red-gold hair untrimmed , still in the old black coat and kilt , still bare of foot and leg . In his brown eyes sympathy struggled with mirth . He added , " And it is a sorry state you are in , too . It seems you have brought half the bog with you . " " Yes , it is the American lass , " my rescuer said . " And why has she been snooping in these woods , eh ? " I said swiftly to Charles , " Someone sent me a note . " I held the paper out to him . " I thought it was from you . " He took it . " We will talk about that later . Right now we will go back to the fire . " We went around another bend in the path and emerged into a small grassy clearing . Beside a rude wooden hut , its roof thatched with heather , a small fire burned . An old man and a boy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , stood warming themselves at the pale yellow flames . Charles said , " See what Sandy fished out of the bog ! " Then , to me : " Best go into the hut and rid yourself of those clothes . There is a clean shirt of mine hanging on the peg . Put that on , wrap a blanket around you , and come back to the fire . " As I hesitated , shivering with cold , he added , " All right . Keep your shift if you must . But throw that muddy cloak and your dress out onto the grass . Johnny here " ? he  | nodded toward the boy ? " will wash them in the pool . " He gave my shoulder a gentle shove . " Go , Elizabeth . Do you want to catch a chill ? " So , just as I had believed when I read that spurious note , Charles had remembered my name . I stepped into the hut and closed the door . Gray light filtering between the rough boards which formed its walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly at one end . Otherwise the room was empty except for the Prince 's clean but worn-looking white woolen shirt , swaying from the peg on the door , and a stone jug , of the sort that usually holds brandy , in one corner . Evidently only the Prince slept here . His even hardier guardians , apparently , bedded down under the sky . I took off my mire-weighted cloak and dress . My shift , although wet , was comparatively clean . Opening the door narrowly , I tossed my cloak and dress onto the grass . Then I wrapped myself in one of the blankets and moved toward the fire . My rescuer and the old man had disappeared . The boy , with my cloak and dress over his arm , was moving away through the trees . On the opposite side of the fire , I noticed , the men had already set up a drying rack , a stout pole stretching several feet above the ground and supported at each end by a notched tree branch . Charles sat on a log beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit as close to the fire as you can . " When I had settled myself on the log , he reached behind it and brought up a stone jug and a pewter cup . " Brandy , " he said , spilling amber liquid into the cup . " It is a sovereign remedy for ladies who have been floundering in bogs , and for much else , too . "  | He was right . After the first sip of the fiery liquid , I felt warmth begin to spread through me . Reaching again behind the log , he brought up a bottle . " Highland whiskey , " he explained . " I have developed a taste for it . He drank directly from the bottle , recorked it , and placed the bottle behind the log . " Now , " he said , as he sat down beside me , " who brought you that ? " He broke off . The boy Johnny was coming toward us , my wet garments over his arm . He twisted my cloak and dress until all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the pole . " Thank you , " I said . The boy grinned at me and walked away through the trees . Charles said , " Who brought you that note ? " " I do n't know . When I woke up in my hut this morning , I saw it had been pushed under the door . " I saw puzzlement come into his eyes at the word " hut . " But all he said was , " Who wrote it , do you suppose ? " " I do n't know that , either . " I had been asking myself that question , of course . Who could have known that such a note would send me into these woods ? Obviously it had to be someone who knew of my previous meeting with Charles Edward . Only Jenny and Kenneth and Mag had been in the kitchen when I told of that episode . But undoubtedly they had repeated it to the old footman and the two chambermaids , and they in turn might have told Lady Macduveen and Sir Donald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Macduveen regaling any or all of their guests with the story of their kitchenmaid 's encounter with Charles Edward Stuart .  | Perhaps Donald Macduveen was vicious enough to try to send me to my death in that bog . But there might be others in whom , for some reason unknown to me , I had aroused such enmity or fear that they wished me dead . Clarence MacElvin , my first night at Bowain Castle , had evinced a puzzling amount of curiosity about a mere serving wench . So had his brother Ian , that day he stared down at me from a rear window . Could any of my fellow servants have written that note ? I did not know which , if any , of them was literate . But Kenneth and Angus and Mag and Jenny , I had learned , had each had Dissenting parents and grandparents . My father had told me that such families , with their fierce determination to allow no priestly intercession between themselves and the word of God , usually insisted that every family member be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my thoughts . " One thing is certain . My reputation as a poor scholar must have traveled far and wide . But the fellow who wrote that note pulled too long a bow . Even I know how to spell brandy . Did you , by the way , start out with brandy ? " " Yes . And cheese and meat and bread . " " All lost in the bog , I suppose . " " Yes . " Along with my good red shawl . He sighed . " We have no great need for the food . But I mourn that brandy . " For a while there was no sound except the faint crackle of the fire . Then I said , " I have been thinking about all this . Whoever wrote that note must have known that one of you might hear my screams and come to help me . " His brown eyes were suddenly grave . " I think he did not know . I was supposed to move on from these woods  | two nights ago , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some sort of fever : He did not want to be left behind , and since he has been a good friend to me  --  no friend could be better  --  I sent the MacDonalds on ahead . Sandy and I and the boy and old Ferguson will leave tonight . " He paused and then said , " Probably the story went around that the MacDonalds had been seen leaving Bowain Wood , and that I must be with them . Whoever sent that note expected that you would be entirely alone in here . " And if I had come " at dusk , " as the note instructed , it would have been completely dark under those interlaced trees . Once I had blundered into the bog , I would have had almost no chance of saving myself . I wrenched my mind away from the thought of that black muck smothering my mouth and nose and then closing over my head . I said , " How is it that you are here ? I would have thought that Macduveen lands were the last place you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present English government ? But that is why this is a good place to hide . There are no bands of soldiers roaming Macduveen and MacElvin lands . " " But on Macduveen lands someone besides a soldier may try to collect that thirty thousand pounds . " That chronic wastrel , Sir Donald Macduveen , for instance . " And risk a knife between his shoulder blades some dark night ? " After a moment I said , " I see . " If even such a fanatical anti-Papist as Jenny could feel sympathy for the fugitive , it was easy to imagine how determined his followers  | would be to avenge his capture . " Still , " I said , " I can not understand why you have not been caught . For months now , your movements must have been common talk throughout the Highlands . I know they are up at the castle . And yet you are still free . " He smiled . " Knowing where I am rumored to be is one thing . Finding me still there is another . Always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view . Right now watchers are stationed near the edges of the wood . It was only because of the fog that you were able to slip past without being seen . " Yes , helpers everywhere , including a young woman named Flora MacDonald . I said , " You mentioned some people named MacDonald . Are they kin to Miss Flora MacDonald ? " He laughed . " So you have heard of her and her Irish maid , have you ? Lord , I will never understand how you women get about in skirts . More than once I tripped and nearly fell flat . But as for her being kin to these MacDonalds , or they kin to each other , who can say ? You know how it is with a Highland clan . The members call themselves by the same name and claim common ancestors centuries back . But whether two MacDonalds or two MacIntyres are fifth cousins , or five hundredth cousins , or no cousin at all , they can not tell , nor does it seem to matter . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth and Jenny and Mag had all been born with the surname Macduveen , although any blood kinship that they might have with each other , let alone with the lairds of Bowain Castle , had been lost in the mists of time . " What is Miss Flora MacDonald like ? " He said soberly , " She is a very fine , brave lady . "  | From his tone I knew that no matter what romantic ballads might be written for this or future generations to sigh over , Flora MacDonald had been just that to Charles Stuart  --  a fine lady , who had won his gratitude and respect , but had brought no amorous sparkle to his eye . It was small of me , I know , but I found my discovery pleasant . He said , " Do you feel calm enough to talk about it now ? " When I looked at him questioningly , he went on , " Who could possibly have wanted to send you to your death , Elizabeth ? " " There 's  --  there 's the laird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is your kinsman ! " As he spoke , I saw his eyes go to my hands , coarsened and reddened by the roughest sort of indoor and outdoor work in all sorts of weather . I shook my head . " What my father had always told me was not true . " I drew a deep breath and then , my words tumbling over one another , described the night of my father 's death , and my life at Bowain Castle since then . When I stopped speaking , he said something in a foreign tongue and then smiled at me . " In Italian that means poor little fledgling . " His smile vanished . " The world has not been too kind to either of us these past months , has it ? " " I have not found them as bad as one might think , at least much of the time . I am young and strong , and I have enough to eat , and I have shelter . And I can always hope that my life will change for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many in Scotland can say tonight . " He looked suddenly tired , and much older . I knew he was thinking , not of himself , but of those who  | wandered aimlessly , their poor houses burned , their cattle and small stores of food gone . I knew that he must be thinking of the men in prison hulks and in Inverness jails , and of the wretched hundreds  --  once fiercely proud Highlanders , however poor  --  who had been shipped to the British Colonies in North America and the West Indies to be sold as bond servants . Looking at his face , I wondered if he felt that nothing had been worth all that suffering . Not the gallant landing in the Highlands , nor the rallying of the Jacobites around his red and gold standard , nor that first triumphal march south . He straightened his shoulders and then , with a forcedlooking smile , turned to me . " And is returning to your American village one of your hopes , Elizabeth ? " " To America , perhaps . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk among those who had driven my father , almost penniless , from their midst . " I wish I could help you . But as you see , it is all I can do to help myself . " Again he smiled . " But I think we will meet at some future time , when we are both in better fortune . " His smile turned wry . " Not at the Court of St. James , I fear , at least not for some time . But perhaps at my father 's court in Rome , although even as brightly plumaged a fledgling as you would begin to droop in such a gloomy place as that . " " You did not like growing up there ? " " In that dreary old palace the Pope bestowed upon us , with all those aging exiles talking and talking about the Stuart restoration , and concocting plots that came to nothing ? I think it was because of that endless , empty talk that  | I finally became rash enough to . . . " He broke off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss . You must leave Bowain Castle , Elizabeth , as soon as you can . " " I know . " I had been thinking about that even as I walked ahead of my suspicious rescuer , Sandy . Those first two episodes which had endangered my life might have been accidents . But that note had been no accident . Exactly where I would go I did not know , but surely Angus knew of some family in Garlaig who would be willing to shelter me , at least temporarily . I would return to the castle to get the portmanteau and hand trunk and the few coins in my purse . But sometime after dark , when I was sure no one would be observing me , I would leave . In the next moment I learned I would not have to consult Angus , after all . Charles Edward tugged a tarnished metal button loose from his coat . " There is a couple in Garlaig named Lewis . Mrs. Lewis will recognize this button . She sewed it on for me . Her husband is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you to Inverness Bitterness came into his voice . " Business is brisk there , what with all the English soldiers and the sailors from the warships . You should have no trouble finding work in someone 's shop or household . " I let go of the blanket long enough to take the button . " And now you had best go , " he said . " It will be dark soon . " He gathered my cloak and dress from the pole and , carrying them , walked with me to the hut . I went inside , and he handed my garments in to me . They were still damp , but my shift , warmed by my body and by the fire 's heat ,  | was now dry , and so I would not be too uncomfortable . I dressed swiftly , and thrust the precious button deep into the pocket of my cloak . When I emerged from the hut , he stood beside the fire in the fading light , gaze fixed on the flames that now showed a deeper color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking my right hand , raised it to his lips . When he released it , he said , " I saw you trying to fold the blanket over your hands , Elizabeth . Do you fear you now look like a kitchen drudge ? You do not . In fact , yours is still the most pleasant face to look upon that I have seen . " I smiled . " In all your travels ? " " In all my travels . " He took my face between his hands and kissed me on the lips . Perhaps it was just the loneliness of those past months , but at the touch of his warm lips 1 felt a response that left me shaken . Evidently he experienced something of the same sort , because when he released me , I saw that his eyes had darkened . He said abruptly , " You had best go . " Turning , he gave a soft whistle . After a moment the old man and the boy and Sandy emerged from the wood . Turning hack to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Good-bye , Elizabeth , until we next meet . " I did not believe we would , but I smiled and said , " Until then . " I turned and followed the boy across the clearing and into the wood . He left me where the path joined the road near the ancient stone cross . It was fully dark by the time I entered the castle courtyard through the rear archway . The torches had been lit above both archways , showing me that a coach , the same  | one in which the MacElvin brothers and their wives had departed several days before , again stood in the entrance tunnel . I had intended , before going to the kitchen , to change my still-damp dress for my green muslin , even though I knew that the sight of me in anything but Mag 's too-large blue homespun would annoy Jenny . What matter that I annoyed her , either with my dress or my belated return to the kitchen , when I intended to leave this place within a few hours ? But as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " You are wanted in Lady Macduveen 's sitting room at once . I said , astonished , " Why ? " Except for my first night here , I had never been in Lady Macduveen 's rooms . " I do not know . " Perhaps she did not , with certainty . But I am sure that she had guessed . As she stood there , her manner was no longer harsh , but strangely unsure . I said , " I had intended to change my dress . " To my amazement she said , " That would be best . But hurry . Clarence and Ian MacElvin and their wives are there , and they are all waiting . "  | The door to Lady Macduveen 's rooms stood partly open . As soon as I knocked , I heard quick footsteps . Ian MacElvin opened the door wide . His face , younger and fuller than that of his brother Clarence , held an expression that stunned me . His dark eyes beamed , and his smile had a warm , almost tremulous quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I stepped past him into the mingled light of the fire and of wax tapers in wall sconces , I threw a sweeping look- around me . Lady Macduveen , flanked by the two Mrs. MacElvins , sat on a sofa which stood at right angles to the fire . Sir Donald lounged beside the fireplace , one elbow propped on the black marble mantel . Clarence MacElvin sat beside a small table against one wall , his fingers drumming on its dark polished surface . In the far corner , in Highland dress , stood an old man I had never seen before , nervously turning his bonnet in his hands . Lady Macduveen said , " We have something to tell you , Elizabeth . "  | Elizabeth , not Betty . I looked at her more closely . Even though her lips smiled , her prominent brown eyes revealed an unwonted agitation . Ian MacElvin crossed to the table where his brother sat . On the table close to Clarence MacElvin 's drumming fingers stood a gilt-framed canvas , its face to the wall . Ian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child I had heard some adult say that everyone has , or has had , a duplicate somewhere among the earth 's millions , and that to come face to face with one 's duplicate presaged death . Perhaps that childhood memory was the reason why I felt a chill ripple down my body . Not that the young woman in the portrait was my mirror image . For one thing her costume  --  a blue silk gown , with a bodice insert of lighter blue , and lace sleeve ruffles falling from just above the elbows halfway to the wrist ? belonged to a fashion I could not remember from even my earliest years . For another , her hair was a shade darker than mine . Her rounded chin had a dimple , and at one corner of her smiling mouth there was a tiny mole , or perhaps a beauty spot . I have no mole , and no dimple . But otherwise , feature for feature , the face looking out at me from the canvas was my own . Before anyone spoke , I knew who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bed beneath the tattered yellow canopy , and whose body , long since turned to dust , occupied that other lonely grave up there in the grassy clearing . Even now , in the first dazed moment after I had looked into her pictured face , I had room to wonder how it was that she , in the bloom of her youth , and surrounded  | by so much magical loveliness , could have walked into that loch . Ian MacElvin , too , was looking at the pictured face . " At my request , Lady Macduveen had the storerooms searched until that portrait was found . " There was tenderness in his voice and in his dark eyes that looked close to tears . " The girl in it was seventeen , and still unmarried when she sat for it . Elizabeth do you know who she was ? " Even to my own ears my voice had an odd , hushed quality . " I think she was Arabella Macduveen . " I paused . " And I think I look so much like her because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm 's son , his  --  his illegitimate son . " I turned to face him . " Is that not the truth ? " He looked startled . " It is . But how did you know it ? " " Because until I came here I always believed that my father 's father was Malcolm Macduveen . My father had told not only me that , but my mother , and everyone else in our village in America . " I paused , and then added painfully , " What he did not tell me was that he was illegitimate . He could not bring himself to tell me that even on the night he died . " But he almost had . " Part of what I have always told you was true , " he had said . " I am sure of it . You are my surety . " How old was I when my father first noticed the startling resemblance which confirmed his belief that we both possessed Macduveen blood ? Had I been twelve ? Thirteen ? However old I was , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestry had not been a mere fantasy , made up out of the whole cloth . Perhaps when he  | was so small that the incident had been lost to his conscious memory , he had heard some revealing conversation between his sempstress mother and the shoemaker who had married her . Perhaps he had heard his mother praying to the saints for forgiveness for her sin . Whatever the reason , long before I was born he must have been at least halfway convinced that his bloodline gave him a rightful claim to his elegant manners and his taste for fine clothes . Ian was looking at me , still with that moist-eyed tenderness . I knew that it was not for me . It was for a girl long dead , a girl who had married , not him , but that silent brother of his who sat staring expressionlessly at the wall . " But , child , why did you not tell someone here that you believed yourself to be of Macduveen blood ? " " Because I no longer believed it . On  --  on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my father confessed that he had lied to me all my life . He had not grown up here as Sir James Macduveen 's nephew . Instead he had been a potboy , and his mother the castle sempstress . I do not know for certain why he did not tell me that he nevertheless believed the shoemaker his mother married had not been his real father . But I think he did it for the sake of his mother 's memory , and for my sake too . He 'd had to tell me that  --  that I was the daughter of a fraud . He ( lid not want to risk leaving me burdened also with the belief that my grandmother had been a wanton . " Ian said gently , " She was not that . " " I am sure she was not . But my father was dying . Perhaps he found he had not the strength to give me a true picture of his mother . And so he chose to have me believe that he himself had been the son of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my  --  my appearance , do  | you have any proof that ? " " Yes . After I saw you in the courtyard that day last week , I made it my business to find proof . " He paused . " Do you know what your grandmother 's maiden name was ? " I frowned , trying to remember . " It is on her tombstone in the graveyard beside the kirk . I think the name on the stone is Sara Fraser Logan . " He nodded . " I too went to the graveyard in Garlaig . The kirk 's sexton told me that according to the parish records she had come from a family of crofters near Mallaig . I went there , and found that one of her younger brothers was still alive . " At his nod , the old man with the worn Highland plaid draped over his shoulder came hesitantly forward . " Elizabeth , this is Alex Fraser . Now , Alex , tell her what you told me . " The gnarled fingers clutched the bonnet tightly now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , faded blue ones , held the shame of a memory he must have thought long buried in the past . " My sister Sara came here to be sempstress many years ago . Before the turn of the century , it was . That one " ? he nodded toward the portrait ? " was a wee lass only a few years out of the cradle then , but her brother Sir James was twenty-two and already the laird , and her brother Malcolm was almost twenty . " He stopped , his Adam 's apple working . I averted my gaze for a moment from his embarrassed face . " My grandmother 's brother , " I thought . What a divided heritage I had . On one side , dwellers in crofts . On the other , the lairds of Bowain Castle . I wanted to say , " I am glad and proud you are my great-uncle . " Without  | crofter blood , I might not have survived these past few months . But of course I could not tell him that , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it hard enough to tell his story . " My sister came home to the croft one day , " he said . " She had caught young Malcolm 's eye , and she had found him too pleasing to rebuff , and anyway , she was with child . " Again turning the bonnet between his hands , he went on to say that the Frasers had loaned money to some hardpressed crofters named Logan . Their eldest son , Walter , a shoemaker by trade , was still unmarried . " We struck a bargain . If Walter Logan would marry my sister , we would cancel the Logans ' debt to us . He did marry her , and came to Bowain Castle as shoemaker . " He looked at me earnestly . " Your grandmother was no wanton . She spent the rest of her life repenting her sin . " I nodded , remembering Jenny 's scornful account of the hidden crucifix , the prayers to the saints . Apparently the fact that my grandmother had escaped the world 's censure had only intensified her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all the people now at Bowain Castle , both gentry and servants , she and Kenneth alone had been here thirty-odd years ago , when Arabella was still alive . Kenneth had been only a child then , too young to retain any memory of my great-aunt except that she had been " bonnie , " and kind to his parents . True , perhaps the faint puzzlement in his eyes that first day he saw me had sprung from some confused recollection of Arabella 's face . But if so , apparently it had not been strong enough to emerge into his full consciousness . Jenny , though , had been a mature woman at the time of  | Arabella 's suicide . Surely she had realized at first sight of me that I was of Macduveen blood . Why , then , had she kept silent ? No doubt she would say that she did not want to confront me with my grandmother 's " shame . " But I felt that her real reason had been a hatred of my grandmother , that secret Papist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her iron rule in the kitchen , and who most certainly had run off to fight for another Papist . The last thing she would have wanted would be to see Sara Fraser Logan 's granddaughter , Walter Logan 's daughter , recognized as a Macduveen . Perhaps she had been hoping these past months that I , like my father , would flee her kitchen , and do so before someone else recognized my heritage in my face . Alex Fraser had turned to Ian MacElvin . " If it suits you , I will go now . " Ian MacElvin nodded . " My thanks to you . " I saw him dip fingers into the pocket of his silk tartan waistcoat , saw a glint of gold as he held something out to Alex Fraser . The old man said with dignity , " No need of that , Mr. MacElvin . It is for the sake of the lass that I came here to tell the truth . It is not right that she should be so alone in the world . " He looked gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then walked to the door . When he had gone , leaving a silence behind him , I too looked around the room . At Clarence MacElvin , who still sat with his dark eyes fixed enigmatically on the far wall . At his proud , handsome wife , whose dilated nostrils showed how little she found the situation to her taste . At Lady Macduveen , who smiled at me , but whose dismayed  | brown eyes seemed to hold the wish that her late husband 's young brother had broken his reckless neck before , rather than after , Sara Fraser had become the household sempstress . At the very least , I reflected , she must be wishing that Malcolm 's by-blow , my father , had kept himself and his daughter on the other side of the Atlantic . I looked at Ian MacElvin 's wife . Her round face under the faded red hair was so troubled , and her blue eyes so frightened , that even before I remembered the kitchen gossip about her " daft " love for her husband , I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's longdead love ? Or was she afraid that he might transfer that love to me , a girl young enough to be his granddaughter ? Last of all I looked at Donald Macduveen , still lounging against the fireplace mantel . The smile with which he returned my gaze held a covert sneer , but I could see uneasiness in his eyes . Perhaps he wondered if my circumstances might alter to the point that I could even some old scores . Ian MacElvin said , " Elizabeth , please sit down . " When I had taken the chair he held for me , he said , still standing , " I have conferred with my wife , and with my brother and his wife , and with Lady Macduveen . We all agree that your situation can not remain as it is . That is true , is it not , Lady Macduveen ? " " Quite true . " Seeing her bright , fixed smile , I recalled hearing from more than one source that it was MacElvin money which had kept Bowain Castle from being sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ian MacElvin 's money . Although it was the older brother who held title to the estate adjoining the Macduveen lands , it was Ian who had become the richer , through investments in West  | Indian sugar plantations and South African cattle lands . In addition to the new house he had built near the ancestral MacElvin manor , he owned an older house in Inverness , and another in London . " And so , " Ian MacElvin said , " my wife and I would like to become your guardians . Is that agreeable ? " Was there any need to ask ? Certainly not of me , who only an hour before had planned to slip away from this place , ride in a creaking cart to Inverness , and there take whatever employment I could find . " Of course it is agreeable . And I am more grateful than I can express . " " Splendid . Now I must explain that my wife and I travel a great deal . In fact next week we sail for a visit to South Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife feels , in fact we both feel , that for the present it would be best for you to remain here , with a suitable allowance from us , of course . Later on we will be delighted to have you spend as much time as possible with us . " I was silent . In Bowain Wood , Charles Edward and I had agreed that it would be folly for me to remain here . But although I did not know the identity of my enemy , I did know one thing . He or she was a coward , afraid to move openly and directly against even a penniless , friendless kitchen wench . If he had been any other sort , he long since would have come to that cobbler 's hut one night and thrust a knife into my heart as I slept . Surely such a person would make no further attempt against a young woman who was an acknowledged Macduveen , and the ward of a rich and powerful man . I said finally , " It is agreeable . " I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make my smile  | reassuring . I wished that I could tell her that , no matter how grateful I was to her husband , he could never be the irresistible figure in my eyes that he so plainly was in hers . No , not even if he wanted to be , and I was sure he did not . My gaze moved to the woman next to her . " Lady Macduveen , are you willing to have me here ? " Her tone was bright . " Most certainly . I have already ordered that a room be prepared for you for tonight . And tomorrow you may choose whatever room you wish to be yours from then on . " I knew which room it would be , if she really gave me my choice  --  Arabella 's room . And I would replace the tattered hangings and canopy with silk of the same shade of yellow . Ian MacElvin , his eyes cold now , was looking at his brother . " Are these arrangements satisfactory to you and your wife , Clarence ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told you they were . " Ian flushed . He started to say something , seemed to change his mind , and then , apparently , changed it again . " But what you have not told me , at least not to my satisfaction , is why you did not tell me months ago that Elizabeth was here . True , I was in London , but you could easily have sent me word . " " But I did explain my silence on that point . The girl looked vaguely familiar , but that was all . " Ian 's flush deepened . " I do not believe you . Arabella was your wife . Surely you remembered her face clearly enough to see that this girl ? " " Very well ! " Clarence 's face too was flushed now . " I  | did see that they were almost as much alike as two peas , and that she must be of Macduveen blood . But the question was , from which Macduveen did she descend ? " He hesitated , as if half afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " It might have been Arabella . It would not be the first time a girl of gentle blood secretly gave birth , palmed off her illegitimate child on some low-born couple , and then married a man of her own rank . And if that had been the case here ? well , a man does not like to have it known that he was cuckolded even before he was wed ! " I saw Ian MacElvin 's fists clench . He took a step toward his brother and then checked himself . " Very well . " His voice was thick . " I accept your explanation , although it is one that does you little credit . In fact , now that you have revealed the quality of your mind , I wonder even less that after Arabella became your wife ? " He broke off , perhaps because he feared his own rising anger , perhaps because he had remembered that his brother 's present wife was in the room . He turned back to me . " Now there is the matter of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son would make no objection if you took the name of Macduveen . " His tone , although pleasant , seemed to warn that they had better not object . " You are also free to take the name MacElvin , if you wish . " I said , without having to think about it , " Thank you , but I was very proud of my father . I would prefer to keep his name . " He looked startled at that , and then pleased . Bending , he kissed my cheek . I think it was not until that moment that he began to think of me as a person in my own right ,  | rather than the grandniece of his long-dead love . Donald Macduveen was moving toward me . He said , " Since it appears that we are first cousins , may I claim the cousinly privilege ? " " First cousins once removed , " I corrected evenly . " Sir James was your father . His brother Malcolm was my grandfather . " He said , bending , " Nevertheless . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . When he straightened , we exchanged a long look . It declared a kind of truce between us . We would never be friends , his eyes and mine silently acknowledged . But on the other hand , we need not be at each other 's throats . Smiling , Ian MacElvin said to the room at large , " There is French wine clown in our coach . Lady Macduveen , will you have someone fetch it ? " Rising , she pulled the bell rope . Gerald must have been hovering near the door , because only seconds passed before he shuffled in . It was the sight of my fellow servant , I think , which made me conscious of the full enormity of what had happened to me within the last few minutes . I felt a kind of numbing awe . Last June , on the road leading up to Castle Bowain , a few words of Kenneth 's had destroyed my whole future world , a world in which my father , if he did not live , would at least die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , three months later , a few words from Ian MacElvin had made that world whole again . Not in its entirety , of course . The past could not be changed . My father still had died in an abandoned cowshed , and been buried in a hillside grave . Months of hard labor had coarsened and reddened my hands , and mo-  | ments of humiliation and of terror had scarred my memory . Furthermore , my father 's Macduveen blood had been illegitimate , and that would count against me in the eyes of many . Nevertheless , the wish I had harbored in childhood was coming true . For as long as I chose , I could live as a Macduveen at Bowain Castle , and look out of Arabella 's window at the sloping moor , and , whenever the fancy took me , climb the stairs to one of the corner towers to watch the island of Skye change its colors in the everchanging light , like an island in a dream . Still feeling dazed , I heard Lady Macduveen order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inverness , in the summer of 1750 , that I saw John Harwood again . I stood that day at the window of the room I always occupied when staying at the MacElvins ' tall old house on Inverness 's High Street . Across the way the ancient Mercat cross rose from the Stone of Tubs , a platform upon which many generations of Inverness women , before toiling the rest of the way up the street , had rested the waterfilled buckets they had carried up from the river . On this August afternoon a half dozen of them had gathered around the stone to chat and to ease their tired arms . As always when I saw them , I remember how my own arms used to ache when I carried water from the castle well into the kitchen . And as always , I felt renewed gratitude to the kindly pair who had rescued me from drudgery and loneliness . Dora MacElvin  --  Aunt Dora to me now  --  had long since lost her jealous fear of me . In fact , a warm affection had sprung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had lost as a very young girl . To her I was almost the  | daughter that she , the mother of three grown sons , had always wanted . I am sure she enjoyed more than I did our twice-yearly excursions to London , where we would stay at the MacElvin house in Russell Square and visit all the shops , and buy , at her insistence , more gloves and stays and dress material than I really required . No such closeness had developed between Lady Macduveen and me . She remained courteous , placid , and aloof . I did not mind in the least . I had my room ? Arabella 's room . And I had the moors and the glens which I still roamed in almost any sort of weather , delighting in the deep purple and blue of heathery moor and distant mountains when clouds passed overhead , and then , the next moment , delighting in the sun that struck answering light almost everywhere  --  on the shiny , dancing leaves of poplars , on the foam of racing burns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of snow . And I had my father 's grave . The MacElvins had told me that , if I so desired , they would arrange to have his coffin reburied in the churchyard at Garlaig . I had decided against it . He had died in his own religion , and with his soul at peace . Best to leave his mortal remains undisturbed , there near the grave of the tragic young woman who , although only five years older than he , had been his aunt . As for Donald Macduveen and me , we had kept to the tacit truce we had made that day in his mother 's sitting room . Often he was away from Bowain Castle , roistering with his friends on someone else 's estate or  --  so I gathered from the MacElvins  --  in Edinburgh 's taverns and brothels . But whenever we were both at Castle Bowain , we treated each other with outward friendliness .  | For a short time after I became Ian MacElvin 's legal ward , a certain gallantry in Donald Macduveen 's manner had hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely amusing himself , or whether he thought my new status would make it profitable to marry me , I do not know . Whatever his motive , he desisted when he saw how little I welcomed his elaborate compliments . To Aunt Dora 's sorrow , I had also rebuffed other potential husbands . Not that any man with a title or considerable wealth had sought me out . After all , my father had been of illegitimate birth , and everyone knew it . But three eligible suitors had come my way  --  a younger son of a marquis , and two business associates of Ian MacElvin . I had discouraged all three of them . To Aunt Dora , thirty years the wife of a beloved husband , my behavior seemed incomprehensible . Yes , even after I had told her about John Harwood . Did I , she asked , anxiety clouding her round face , intend to remain a spinster all my life just because of a man on whom I had once set my heart ? Surely he had not been so foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a husband , but a father twice or three times over . I realized that far more keenly than she ever could . There were still times when the thought of John Harwood married to some other woman , sharing his bed with her , and tossing their child in his arms , was like a knife thrust in my breast . But the realization that probably he now thought of me seldom , or not at all , made me no more inclined to marry just for the sake of enhanced social status , or even for the sake of having children . Better to live as I did now than with some man for whom I could feel  | only tepid affection . Yes , even though there seemed little chance that I would ever see John Harwood again . But I did see him that bright August afternoon , only about half an hour after the MacElvins had brought me from Bowain Castle to their Inverness house . Leaving a maid to finish unpacking my trunk , I had crossed to the window to look down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw two well-dressed men and a woman in a hooded , fur-trimmed cloak moving up the sidewalk . They stopped near the group of women around the Stone of Tubs and looked at the MacElvin house , as if wondering whether or not it was the one they sought . It was then that I saw that the woman was Charity Clayman , her upturned face older and even plainer now , but still appealing in its gentleness . The elder of the two men was her father , and the other was John Harwood . His face , under his tricorn hat , was also older than the one engraved on my memory , and much more self-assured . But as I was learning , it still had the power to make me feel physically weak , as if my bones had softened . I clutched the window frame . John said something to Mr. Clayman . The three of them . started across the street . I clung to the window frame for another second or two and then , pulses racing , turned around . Halfway across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John ? When we last saw each other , I had been eighteen . Now I was nearing twenty-three . I could hear voices in the ground floor hall . Careless of the maid 's curious stare , I sat down at the dressing table , smoothed my hair , and gazed searchingly at my reflection . It seemed to me that my face had not changed at all . But of course it must have , in four and a half years .  | And then my face began to burn with the realization of my own foolishness . Charity was with him . Charity was his wife . Why would she be here , why should she have made that long and uncomfortable journey across the ocean , if not because she found the thought of separation from her husband unendurable ? Women like Charity , with mothers and sisters and brothers , did not spend weeks on a tossing ship just to be near their fathers . No longer greatly concerned with how I looked , I rose from the dressing table and went down the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several voices , including the MacElvins ' . Apparently the visitors had introduced themselves . Just inside the doorway I dropped a curtsy and then , with a smile I knew was too fixed and bright , looked at Charity , at her father , and finally at John . I said , " This is indeed a surprise . What brings all of you to Scotland ? " John was looking at me with that smile I remembered . Feeling a rush of that old longing and pain , I almost hated him for having come here . " Business has brought us , " he said . " The tobacco business , " Mr. Clayman added . Now I noticed that the bushy sideburns bracketing his thin , pleasantly shrewd face , a grizzled brown when I had last seen him , were gray . " As I was telling Mr. and Mrs. MacElvin , John and I now have an interest in a Virginia tobacco plantation . We have just signed a contract with a Glasgow firm to send them two shiploads a year . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | " Then you have given up the law , John ? " " No , nor my share of the Harwood farm , either . But farming does not take up all of a man 's time , and in a small village practicing law takes even less . " I wished he had not mentioned his share of the Harwood farm , where he and I had planned to build our house overlooking the fields of Shinnecock Bay . Why had he come here , anyway ? To torment me ? No , of course not . Surely it was just that he had thought the memory of our love would have grown as dim for me as it had for him , so that to me he and Charity would be merely old friends from across the ocean . " As I was telling Mr. Clayman and Mr. Harwood before you came in , " my guardian said , " it might be wise for one of them to stay here permanently . " As always when he spoke of financial matters , his face and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland ? very brisk indeed . You might find daily association with our merchants very profitable . " " We have discussed my becoming the firm 's representative in Scotland , " John said . My heart cried out in silent protest . It was painful enough that they had come here . Would I , now , be expected to stand as godmother to their children ? Since I knew I must exchange courtesies with her sooner or later , I turned to Charity . " How pleasant that you could come to Scotland too . " I added , with bright falsity , " It is good to see you . You are looking very well . " The wryness in her large brown eyes , her best feature , told me that she knew the years had not improved her looks . " Thank you , Elizabeth . "  | " And your mother and your brother and sisters ? How are they ? " " My brother and both my sisters are married now . " She paused , and then added quietly , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so sorry . " And I was . I had liked Mrs. Clayman , a handsome , friendly woman who , unfortunately , had passed her good looks on to her son rather than to any of her daughters . But at the same time I felt a selfish surge of hope . Perhaps it was because Charity and her father were now alone that she had undertaken the long voyage . Aunt Dora said , " Elizabeth . " I turned to her . From the bright urgency in her face I knew that she had been trying to catch my eye ever since I entered the room . " Ca n't you persuade Miss Clayman and her father to stay with us ? Surely they can not be very comfortable at the inn . " A weight seemed to lift from my chest , so that once more I could breathe normally . I warned myself , though , not to hope too much or too quickly . Charity was far from being the only girl he might have married . " Thank you , Mrs. MacElvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various shipping firms will be calling upon us at the inn . We decided that since we were to be in Inverness anyway , we might as well learn if some company here could offer us better rates than American and Glasgow shippers have . " A serving man had come in , carrying a tray laden with wineglasses . The conversation became general then . From it I learned that John and the Claymans had gone by hired coach from Glasgow to Bowain Castle . There Lady Macduveen had told them that I had gone to Inverness with  | the MacElvins . When I heard that , I felt there was no longer any need to restrain my hope . Business matters might have brought John to Glasgow . It was I who had brought him to the north . " Lady Macduveen told us about your father . " The restraint in Mr. Clayman 's voice reminded me that he , like every other man in Southampton , had voted to banish Walter Logan . " We were sorry to hear of his death . " What else had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cowshed ? That I myself for four months had drudged in the castle kitchen ? No , it would have been unpleasant to tell them that , and Lady Macduveen avoided unpleasantness whenever possible . I turned to John and added , trying to make my voice light , " I am surprised you remembered the name of my father 's birthplace . I can not recall mentioning Bowain Castle to you more than a few times . " John said quietly , " I remembered . " Aunt Dora broke the brief silence . " Have you seen the view from the bridge at the foot of this street , Mr. Harwood ? It is considered very fine , especially toward evening . " " No , I have not , Mrs. MacElvin . " " Elizabeth , why do n't you show it to him ? You 've had no exercise today . A turn in the fresh air would do you good . " I felt color in my face . Concealment of her emotions or her motives had never been Dora MacElvin 's strong point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ? " " I do . " " Then if everyone will excuse me , I will get my cloak . " As I rose , I saw Charity looking at John with defeated  | longing in her brown eyes . I knew then that it was not just to be with her bereaved father that she had crossed the ocean . She must have been hoping that John would not find me , or would find me married . I felt a moment 's sharp compassion for her . But as I hurried up the stairs , all thought of her was drowned by my eagerness to be out on the windy high street with John .  | Even on a bright afternoon in August , Inverness air can be brisk . As we moved down the sloping high street , past the tall houses with their ground floor shops , past the ruins of the castle , blown up by my barefooted friend Charles Edward during the months when he was moving from victory to victory in northern Scotland , past the large house where his ancestress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies had denied her entrance to that same castle , a sharp wind tore at my green velvet cloak and plucked strands of hair from beneath my hood to blow across my face . For a while we walked in silence . Then , because I could no longer wait to make sure , absolutely sure , I asked , " John , do you have a wife ? " " No . And you , are you pledged to anyone ? " The sharpness of his tone told me that , beneath that controlled manner of his , he had been as anxious as I. " No . " My heart swelled with exultation . He still loved me . He had followed me to this tumultuous but beautiful land ,  | and here we would marry . Surely some such thought , such hope , had been in his mind when he came here . He could manage the Scottish affairs of the tobacco firm . Perhaps he could even be admitted to the practice of law in Scotland . And he and I would live an ocean away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held for both of us . What had become of Perhaps I had buried it there in the dawn light that day I had buried my father . I could not be sure . All I knew was that now I accepted what John had done . He would not have been the strong , disciplined man I loved if , after taking his oath to uphold the law , he had not found my father guilty of the charges our village had brought against him . He said , " When Lady Macduveen mentioned that she had a son , I thought perhaps ? " " That I might be pledged to him ? " I laughed . " It is hard to imagine any woman wanting to marry Donald Macduveen . " " But surely it has not been for lack of suitors that you are still free . " Emotion had roughened his voice . " You seem to me lovelier than before , and I do not think it is just because of your fine clothes . " I savored that for a long moment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was almost sure it would make no difference to him . But still , best to tell him . We were midway of the stone bridge 's span now . I halted and looked up at him . " Yes , I have had a few suitors , but none to my liking , and none as rich or wellplaced as you might think . You see , John , my father was  | the son of a younger brother of a baronet . But he was not a legitimate son . That makes a difference . " I saw surprise in his face , and puzzlement , but nothing that resembled shock . Then he must have read at least some anxiety in my eyes , because he said , " It does not make a difference , not to me . But I think you had best tell me all about it . " As we leaned against the bridge parapet , looking down the wind-ruffled river toward the bluff guarding the entrance to Moray Firth , I did tell him . The bitter journey north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lonely grave . Those months which had brought me , not only the hardest sort of toil , but moments of terror too . " That pistol shot into the courtyard and my plunge down those stairs both could have been accidents . But that note , of course , was quite another matter . " John 's face had grown pale . " Who could have done that to you , a helpless young girl ? Who could have wanted to ? " " I still do not know . " Many times during the past four years I had pondered that question . Either of the Macduveens could have forged that note and slipped it under my door during the night . So could Clarence MacElvin or his wife . The MacElvin manor house was only eight miles from Bowain Castle . For that matter  --  although the idea was too absurd to entertain for even a moment  --  my kind , business-absorbed guardian or his wife , my loving Aunt Dora , could have sent me into that bog . They had been staying at their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . And any one of several of the servants could have written the note . I managed to find that out , the first week after my status changed from kitchen wench to family member , by asking seemingly casual questions of Lady Macduveen . The aged footman and two equally aged serving women she had brought with her to Bowain Castle were all illiterate . But Jenny and Mag and Kenneth and Angus , each the offspring of stern Covenanter parents , had learned their letters in childhood .  | As for Murdock , I had been unable to learn whether or not the mute falcon keeper could read and write . Probably he had never learned , or , if he had learned in his long-ago childhood , had forgotten during his many years of silence and isolation . It was an isolation I had not again attempted to invade . Absurd as his threat had been that day , I had been a little frightened by his wild aspect , and more than a little repelled by the odor of aged flesh and long unwashed clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " " I had not planned to . I had planned to slip away , first to Garlaig , then to Inverness , and find work there . " I told him of the button Charles Edward had wrenched from his ragged coat and given to me , together with instructions to show it to the carter in Garlaig . " But within a few minutes after I returned to the castle that day , my whole world had changed . I was no longer a penniless servant with no one to care whether she lived or died . My father had been a Macduveen , even though from the wrong side of the blanket . " He was frowning . " And that made you feel safe ? " " Safe enough to take what was offered , instead of slaving in someone 's kitchen in Inverness ! And I was right . There have been no more tricks played on me , not once in the past four years . " It was in part my reading of my enemy 's character  | which made me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was more than cowardly . His was one of those selfdivided natures , chronically given to half measures . Instead of attacking swiftly and decisively some night as I lay asleep in the cobbler 's hut , what had he done ? He had  --  perhaps  --  fired at me at night in the courtyard , when chances were excellent that he might miss . He had  --  perhaps  --  pushed me down the turret stairs , with no surety that the plunge would he fatal . And he had directed my steps into the bog , without being absolutely certain that no one would hear my screams , as indeed someone had . A person so lacking in cold-blooded resolve as to bungle the death of a friendless servant , I felt , would certainly make no move to attack Ian MacElvin 's ward . And so it had proved to be . " You say this Stuart fellow gave you a button from his coat ? " Hearing the jealousy in his voice , I smiled inwardly . " Yes . " And a kiss , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say he is handsome . " " Yes , and brave . But ? " " But what ? " " Many who worship him would not agree , but I would say it is plain now that it was an evil day for Scotland when he raised his banner in the Highlands . " Less than a week after I had sat shivering beside his fire in Bowain Wood , Charles had shipped aboard a French ship and sailed away . His physical ordeal was over . But Scotland 's ordeal remained . True , the dungeons in the Tolbooth cellar here in Inverness and the stinking prison  | ships anchored in London 's Thames River had long since delivered up their wretched inmates  --  a few to freedom , many to death by disease or on the gallows , many others to the transports carrying bondservants to America and the West Indies . But Scotland 's punishment was not ended . Possession of a claymore , the fearsome Highland broadsword , was punishable by death . Bewildered crofters , who had lived all their lives by raising cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coastal villages , and told that if they did not want to starve they must learn the skills of fishermen or weavers . What seemed to me most humiliating of all was a comparatively minor stricture . Highland dress , including the bonnet , plaid , and kilt , was strictly forbidden . All Scotsmen must wear trousers , even if they were too poor to buy new cloth to make them . And so in the villages and on the roads and even here in Inverness , you saw them by the hundreds ? once proud Highlanders in pitiful , ridiculous-looking breeches they had made by sewing a central seam in their faded kilts . As for the Prince , he was said to be moving with a small entourage from one European capital to another , trying to gain support for another landing in Scotland . It was also said that his liking for strong drink , understandable enough when he was an often cold and hungry fugitive , had not diminished now that he lived in safety . I said , " I do n't think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should that matter to us ? Why should we be concerned with Charles Stuart or his father ? Elizabeth , look at me ! " Heartbeats quickening , I looked up at him . He said ,  | " Do you know why I have not married ? " After four years of longing for this man , I felt little inclined toward maidenly coyness . " I think so . I think it is for the same reason that I have not . " I saw the leap of joy in his eyes . " Then you will marry me ? " " Yes , John . Yes ! " From the way his gaze went over my face , lingering on my mouth , I knew he wanted to catch me in his arms and kiss me , just as I longed for him too . But it was still broad daylight . And although no one was crossing the bridge at the moment , people moved along both embankments . Later there would be time for kisses  --  all the time we chose to take . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost years to make up for . " " Of course I will . " " Then we will marry before we sail . I suppose you would rather be married in your guardian 's house anyway . I could see that the three of you are fond of each other . " The brisk breeze , until now only exhilarating , felt suddenly cold . " Sail ? Sail where ? " " Why , home , of course . Southampton . " " Southampton is not my home ! " I said wildly . " Scotland is . And I thought you were ready to make it your home . " " Whatever gave ? " " When Ian MacElvin suggested it might he best for you to remain in Scotland , you said you and Mr. Clayman had considered it . " " Considered it , yes , and decided against it . " " Why did n't you say so , right then ? " I felt a foreboding , almost a despair . Were our wills always to clash , with  | both of us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your guardian . I did not want to argue with him . And it might be wise to have someone stationed permanently in Scotland . Perhaps , if the business grows , we will send someone . But it will not be me . My great-grandfather helped found Southampton Colony . The house where I was horn is there . My law practice is there . All my roots are in Southampton , Elizabeth , and so are yours . " " If they were , the people there tore them up ! They stripped my father of everything  --  his pupils , his house , everything , and then turned him out to die . " John 's face looked bleak . " I too voted to banish him . " " Yes ! But I can forgive you because I know how loath you were to do it . You voted out of principle , not as many of the others did , because they resented his clothes and his manners or his learning , or wanted his house ! I can not get over my bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he said quietly , " Not even for the sake of love ? " I looked at him with desperate need . Then , in my mind 's eye , I saw myself moving along Southampton 's streets , coming face to face with men who had exiled my father , and with their wives who , aware that we could not refuse their offers , had bought our household goods at a fraction of their worth . " I can not live surrounded by people I so detest . I would be unhappy , and I would make you unhappy . And we could both be so happy here . Scotland is a lovely place . And my guardian is rich . If you needed money to expand your business ? " " No , Elizabeth . Southampton is my home . I will live  | there , and so will my wife , and my children will grow up there . " As we gazed at each other , I knew my face must appear as wretched as his . " I love you , Elizabeth . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another woman . But I will be thirty my next birthday . It is time I had a wife , a home , and sons . " He paused for a moment , and then went on evenly , " It is you I want to marry . I know it would not be easy for you at first , living in that village . But time has a way of softening everything , even bitterness . And surely our happiness in our home should compensate you for whatever unhappy memories your surroundings awake in you . " I looked at him in silent misery . How could he be so cruel ? How could he force me to choose between parting from him again , or living with him among people who had so grievously injured my father and me ? " When you turned away from me four years ago , Elizabeth , I came back three times in hope that I could induce you to change your mind . This time you will have to come to me . We will be staying at the inn until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not I will ever again be in Scotland , I can not say . " Friday . Four days from now . If he had loved me enough to remain unmarried for four years , surely four days would be sufficient for him to realize his unreasonableness . Surely he would see that , aside from any consideration of my happiness , it would be to his financial advantage to stay in Scotland , befriended by a man many times richer than the richest man in Southampton . I said , from a tight throat , " It is getting late . We had best go back . "  | In silence we moved up High Street through the fading light , and entered the house . The others were still in the drawing room . At sight of our faces , dismay leaped into Aunt Dora 's eyes . She said , in a falsely bright voice , " I am glad you are back . Supper will be served soon . " " I am sorry , Mrs. MacElvin , " John said , " but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner . " Had you forgotten that a representative of the Caledonian Shipping Company was to have supper with us ? " Mr. Clayman looked puzzled for a moment , and then said , in an embarrassed voice , " Why , yes . I had forgotten . " I felt tears of pain and anger pressing behind my eyes . Dropping a curtsy to Aunt Dora , I said , " Will you excuse me , ma'am ? I am not feeling well . " I left the drawing room , crossed the hall , and , clutching my skirts with both hands , fled up the stairs .  | Around ten o'clock that night Aunt Dora sat beside my bed wringing out a handkerchief dipped in cold water to place it on my tear-swollen eyes . " Such a foolish young man , " she said . " Here in Scotland my husband could help him to become rich before he is thirty-five . Why should he insist upon returning to that raw little colony set down in the wilderness , especially when you detest it so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . My distress had awakened her pain and indignation . But at the same time she could not help feeling glad that I had refused to return to America . She said , " Surely he will realize his own foolishness . " " Perhaps . But he is very strong-willed . " I realized that some might say that of me . But I had common sense on my side . " Do n't fret , my pretty . He loves you . Why else should a handsome and able man have remained unmarried ? Once he realizes that he can not carry you back across the ocean with him , he will stay on this side of it . Can you sleep  | now ? Do try . " When she had left me , I did not sleep . I rose , put a robe on over my nightdress , and carried the lighted taper from my bedside table to the rosewood writing desk in one corner of the room . From one of the little drawers I took Arabella 's diary , a small volume bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to read her words . I needed them to remind me of wind keening through heather , of Skye 's mountains golden in sunset light , of all that John asked me to leave in favor of a village where every face would bring the taste of gall to my mouth . Even before I had ever opened her diary or any of her much-underlined books , I had begun to feel an almost mystical bond with my dead ancestress . Sleeping in the bed that had been hers , looking into the mirror that must have reflected often her so-similar face , gazing from the window at the sloping moor , purple with heather and green or brown with bracken , which so often must have delighted her eyes , I began to feel that it was not just I who dwelt in that room . At times it was almost as if she were there too , living again through me , touching the yellow brocade bed hangings with my fingers and drinking in the printed lines with my eyes . It was when I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  books unnoticed by me that first time I had slipped into her room  --  that my sense of closeness to Arabella increased . To judge by her portrait she might have been some feather-brained young aristocrat , unconcerned with anything but her face and the latest London fashions . Instead she had not only owned books ? Chaucer , Herrick , Shakespeare , Dryden , Donne  --  but had read them . Many passages were underlined . In the small ,  | neat hand that was to become familiar to me through her diary , she had written brief comments in the margins ? " I have not found it so , " or " How wise ! " or once , beside one of Milton 's dissertations on the feebleness of female intellect , the single word " Bosh ! " But it was her diary that made my great-aunt so real to me that sometimes I found it hard to realize that we had not been contemporaries and friends , that I had not actually shared with her all the emotions she had felt in this room  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hitter hatred . It was old Angus who had found the diary and handed it to me one day when he replaced a cracked board in the window seat . The small book , its silken cover split and mildewed , had been wedged in a narrow space between the wall and the window scat 's frame . Now , even as I had that morning in Bowain Castle , I opened the book and began to read . The first page had been dated Fifth of September , 1 707 . The entry read : " My brother James returned from London today . He brought me not only this journal and the poems of Robert Herrick , which I had asked for , but a doll ! Does he not know that I am twelve years old ? Perhaps not . I wish James was not so much taken up with being a laird , and not so much older than me . Almost twenty years ! I wish my brother Malcolm had chosen some other mount to ride that day . I was only five when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed than James , and lighter of heart . " As always when I read those words , I felt an even stronger sense of kinship with Arabella . Malcolm , her twenty-year-old brother who had seduced the castle  | sempstress and then been thrown to his death by an unruly horse . Had he known that the sempstress was to give birth to his child ? Probably not . I wondered too how often the young girl Arabella had looked down into the castle courtyard and seen her brother 's son , a boy only five years younger than herself , hurrying about his tasks under Jenny 's harsh direction . No matter how often she had observed young Walter Logan , it was unlikely indeed that she had ever guessed that the castle potboy was her nephew . That first entry in her diary continued : " How pleased I am with Robert Herrick ! He loved all the things that I love  --  Christmas and Morris Dancers , and birds  --  even hens ! ? and flowers , and strawberries , and early mornings . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wish our clergymen were more like that . But that is a wicked thing to say . Herrick must have been tainted with Popery . Why else should the Puritan soldiers have turned him out of his church ? And I , like our sovereign , Queen Anne , am a loyal Protestant and abhor all Papists . " On the moor today I saw an eagle soaring . It gave me a dizzy but delightful feeling , as if it were I up there , beating the air with my wings . And beside a burn I found three stalks of butterfly flowers . I know they are called heath orchids , but I have my own names for things . " I too , kneeling beside a heath orchid , had been reminded of lavender butterflies with brown-freckled wings . She had not written every day , or even every week . Perhaps she had been too busy living . But when she had turned to her diary , it usually had been to write of her books , or of one of the ever-changing aspects  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluebells  | and maiden pinks  --  of the moors . Apparently , like me , she had wandered outdoors in all sorts of weather . An entry written in her fourteenth year told me that James 's wife , the first Lady Macduveen , had " berated " her when she returned to the castle " rain-soaked to my pelt . " As she grew older , her literary enthusiasms , as recorded in her diary , had changed . By the time she was seventeen she had esteemed Herrick much less than before , and Shakespeare and Dryden much more . Too , she had begun to copy lines of poetry in her diary , perhaps as an aid to memorizing them . Her political and religious opinions , in the beginning no more than an echo of the adults around her , began to seem heartfelt convictions of her own . She disliked the Tories ( " secret Papists , all of them ! " ) , and esteemed Queen Anne 's Whig minister . She mourned Queen Anne 's sorrows ? " nine times brought to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne 's death the exiled Stuarts would try to seize the throne " and deliver us into the Pope 's hands . " But neither politics nor poetry had replaced her delight in the wild , jumbled landscape stretching around her . Almost every entry spoke of a rare flower discovered in some narrow glen , or graylag geese dark against the sky , or a herd of shaggy red Highland deer thundering away across the heather at her approach . In the early spring of 1714 , in her eighteenth year , she had traveled with her brother James and his wife to be presented at court . It must have been shortly before Queen Anne 's death . ( " She appears monstrous fat , poor lady . But it is not gluttony . She is dropsical . " ) Clarence and Ian MacElvin were in London at the same time , and the three young people went riding together . It was there ,  | in Hyde Park , that she fell in love with Ian . " I wore my new blue velvet riding habit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee under the flowing skirt hooked around the horn of the side saddle , her face , under her plumed hat , flushed with the excitement of being in London , and with Ian . " Clarence 's horse was strong-mouthed , and kept bolting ahead of Ian 's mount and mine , leaving us alone . This pleased me greatly . I do not like Clarence , even though he is already a Whig leader in Scotland , and a well-known supporter of the Protestant succession . His face is too long . And when he thinks I do not see , he has a way of looking at me that makes me feel naked . " It is Ian that I favor . I think I always have , even when we were much younger . He is so handsome , and his eyes are so brown and warm , and his mouth ? I find myself wondering what it would be like to have his mouth touch my own . It was hard for me to imagine my kind , brisk , businessabsorbed guardian , a grandfather several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , of course , he must have been in his early twenties then . Several days later , still in London , she had written : " I have been to four balls , and the MacElvin brothers were in attendance at three of them . I love Ian . And he loves me . In every way but with words he has told me so  --  with his eyes , the tone of his voice , the pressure of his hand when we meet in the figures of the dance . " Clarence 's hands are cold and clammy . " I had meant to stop reading there . I knew there were no more references in her diary to birdsong and the smell of sun-warmed heather . And no joy . But when I closed the book , I instantly saw John 's bleak , set face looking down  | at me as he said , " This time you will have to come to me . " I reopened the diary and went on reading . A month later , back in Scotland , she had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence MacElvin was there . James left me alone with Clarence . He asked me to marry him , and I refused . Afterward I had a terrible quarrel with James . I told him that I loved Ian . He said that Ian has not the influence at court of his brother , nor the land , nor the money . All that is true , although Ian has told me that he intends to become very rich . But whether he does or not does not matter . I love him , I love him . " The writing had become ragged . Evidently she had laid down the pen until she became calmer , because the next paragraph was written with her usual neatness . " James says that if I dare to run away with Ian , it is not only I who will be disinherited . Ian 's father will disinherit him , and will work with both Clarence and James to block Ian in whatever endeavor he pursues . " I know how much Ian loves me . He told me before I left London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I can not marry him , though , I will never marry Clarence . Never ! " For a whole year after that there were only scattered entries , some of them nothing but a few lines of poetry . I knew it had been a momentous year in the world at large . Queen Anne had died , and a German-speaking Hanoverian , George the First , had been anointed King of England , Scotland , and Ireland . The exiled Stuart pretender , the father of my ragged friend Charles Edward , had landed in Scotland and tried to rally sufficient forces to take the throne . In the Battle of Preston , which had meant  | the death of his immediate hopes , an obscure participant had been a boy named Walter Logan . But no word of battles appeared in Arabella 's diary . The first entry after her quarrel with her brother read , " Neither James nor my sister-in-law have spoken to me for three weeks . I take all my meals in my room . " The next , written after an interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . I know I am alarmingly thin , but after a few mouthfuls , I have no appetite . " Weeks after that she had written , " Ian smuggled a note to me this morning by one of the servants . I met him out on the moor , by the old round tower . He implored me to run away with him . I can not . Now he thinks he could face poverty and failure for my sake , but in time he might hate me for it . Or perhaps it is just that I have lost courage , as well as flesh from my bones . " For a while after that there were only scraps of poetry , most of them by John Donne . Not Donne the Dean of St. Paul 's , with his appeals to his stern God . These were lines he had written during his physically passionate younger years , when denied the woman he loved . Arabella had written a half-dozen lines of one poem , beginning with : " For God 's sake , hold your tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What merchant 's ships have my sighs drowned ? Who says my tears have overflowed his ground ? " Still later she had written , " I met Ian on the moor again today . It was raining . He is going to the West Indies on a business venture . He asked me to come with him . It was agony , but I refused . Is it just for his sake that I refuse ? Or is it just that I , gently bred , can not face the thought of  | mean lodgings , coarse food , and shabby garments ? I am so tired and confused that I no longer know even my own mind . " A few days later she must have been thinking of that meeting on the rainy moor when she wrote : Bitter the taste of our final kiss , And bitter the taste of the rain , But would I were climbing the hill tonight To be in your arms again . It was like one last , despairing cry . There were no more entries until several months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Clarence MacElvin . With Ian gone , I can not hold out any longer against James and his wife and Clarence 's father and Clarence himself . And if I can not have Ian , it matters little what happens to me . " The next entry , written almost a month later , read , " My husband has gone to London , to collect rewards due him as a supporter of the new King at the time of , the Stuart Rising . He expects a title as well as lands formerly owned by one of the attainted Tory lords , and I heartily hope he gets neither , although I suppose he is certain to receive some land . I have come home to stay during his absence , as I shall do at every opportunity . " How I hate him . Dear God , how I hate my husband . What a terrible thing it is to have a woman 's body , and be induced to surrender it into the hands of a man like Clarence MacElvin . " Evidently she had found even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter entry she had begun to record various efforts on behalf of the poor and sick in Garlaig and in the crofters ' huts . During that stay at Bowain Castle , and a second one a few weeks  | later , she had written of taking wine and fruit to an old woman with a " monstrous wen " in the village , and to Murdock 's stepdaughter , a " poor , motherless girl with hair as lusterless as dried straw and with black hollows under her eyes , " and to Kenneth 's parents , both mortally ill , and both worried about the future of their small son . Arabella had given them her brother James 's assurance that Kenneth would be trained as a coachman . She had also given another crofter 's widow money " to pay for a proper coffin , " and distributed clothing she had worn in her own not-too-distant childhood to several village families . In all those comings and goings she must have observed cloud shadows , and heard grouse thrumming , and seen wind tear the foam of waterfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Perhaps such things had lost their power to move her . The diary 's last item , dated Third of June , 1716 , was so bittthly triumphant , and so puzzling , that even though I knew it almost by heart , I frowned as I read it . She had written , " Clarence has gone to London , and so now I am back here , and able to write down what has happened . " Yesterday morning a Monsieur LeClerc called at the manor house . Clarence looked so alarmed when the footman came into the drawing room to announce the visitor that I was sure the visit boded ill for him . I went upstairs , and then slipped down to listen through the closed doors . " And now I have him , I have him ! I have had to submit to him in silence in all that pertains to a wife . But in this matter silence on my part would render me as guilty as he is . " I am afraid the footman saw me turn away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has  | told my husband . But I think not , since Clarence set out for London that afternoon to spend several weeks , just as he had intended to do before his visitor arrived . And anyway , nothing or no one will stop me . Since it would be folly to trust what I know to the post , just as it would be to write it in these pages , I will accompany my brother when he goes to London next week . " But she had not gone to London . According to Ian MacElvin , late the next afternoon she had left the castle , telling her brother and sister-in-law that she intended to visit some of the sick she had been befriending . On June 20th , her body was washed up on the shore of the loch , still in the clothing she had worn when she left the castle . The doctor who examined her body said that she had been dead , and in the water , for at least a week . Where she had been wandering for the eight-to-ten-day interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one in the village had seen her during that time , nor any of the crofters she had previously visited . Of course , in the light of that exultantly vindictive entry in her diary , I felt that perhaps she had not gone willingly to her death in that loch . That was why , even though I knew it would awaken painful memories , I had taken the diary one day to my guardian , in the library of the MacElvins ' London house . As he read it , this grandfather and businessman who had once ridden beside a radiant Arabella Macduveen in Hyde Park , I watched the changing emotions of his face  --  amused tenderness , and pain , and an old , unassuaged bitterness . When he closed the little book , I asked , " Did you know that she had discovered something reprehensible about your brother ? Or , at least , thought that she had . "  | " No , I did not . " " Do you have any idea what it could have been ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , especially not at this late date . And if I showed him the diary  --  which I will not , because I could not bear for his hands to touch it  --  he would say that she had been mad when she wrote those words about him , and had proved her madness soon thereafter by taking her own life . " He paused and then said , " I can see that you believe someone might have drowned her in the loch . So did I. But if someone killed her , it was not Clarence . When I returned from the West Indies , soon after her body was recovered from the loch , I satisfied myself on that point . Even if her body had been in the loch two weeks instead of one , Clarence could not have put her there . For nearly a month previously he had been in London , seen each day by dozens of people at St. James or in Parliament or at his solicitor 's in the Inns of Court . " We were both silent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to keep her diary . " " Yes . But if you ? " " No . She was your great-aunt . And I have something you do not  --  actual memories of her . " He paused . " Promise you will not show the diary to Dora , or even tell her of its existence . " " Of course I promise . " For Aunt Dora , already jealous of her husband 's long-dead love , the thought of Ian and Arabella locked in each other 's arms there on the rainy moor would be excruciating . And so the matter had rested . The cruelty and degradation which had turned Arabella from a blithe young girl into a vengeful , perhaps half-mad wife I could imagine , at  | least dimly . But why she had sought death in the cold , deep water of the loch , or had death thrust upon her there , were questions whose answers I had little hope of learning . I placed the frayed little book in its drawer , blew out the candle , and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mind was too full of its tormenting dilemma . Now that John had come back to me , I could not bear to part with him . And yet what happiness could I know with him , or he with me , surrounded by people whose very memory filled me with bitterness ? Surely he would see that . Surely tomorrow morning I would hear the knocker strike , and then his deep voice speaking in the ground floor hall .  | But I did not , neither the next day , nor on the three days thereafter . I stayed indoors all that time . " Inverness is a small place , " Aunt Dora reminded me . " If you go out , you are almost sure to encounter him . He will think you wanted the meeting , and that your resolution is weakening . That will only increase his foolish stubbornness . Make him realize that he must meet your terms or else lose you again . " They were endless , those first three days . I found sleeping difficult , eating more so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I awoke with renewed hope . This was his last day in Inverness . Surely he would not let it pass without walking the few hundred yards which separated the inn on Bank Street from the MacElvin house . I spent most of the morning near my window , watching through the curtain for the first sight of his tall figure striding up High Street . With no appetite , I did not go downstairs for the midday meal . One o'clock passed . Two , When the clock downstairs  | began to strike three , my resolution crumbled . Panic washed over me . He was not coming . If I did not go to him at once , almost certainly I would lose him forever . I snatched my cloak from the wardrobe , flung it around me , and went swiftly down the stairs . Aunt Dora was in the lower hall . " Are you going to the inn ? " " Yes . " Her face had been showing the strain of these past few days . Now her eyes were almost as frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You had best do that . " Afternoon sun lay warm on the sidewalk . I hurried down the slope to the river , almost as smooth as blue glass on this windless day . I passed the bakeshop and the chandler 's shop . Next was the inn , its doors opened wide to the mild air . I went into the big common room and saw the fat proprietor hurrying toward me through the ale-smelling dimness . He said , " Good afternoon . " " Good afternoon . Will you please send word to Mr. Harwood that Miss Logan would like to speak to him ? " " Mr. John Harwood ? He and the lady and the older gentleman left more than an hour ago for Glasgow . " Then , as I reached out to clutch a chair back : " What is it ? Are you ill ? Sit down , and I will bring you a glass . " I managed to say , " No . It was just that it was so very important ? " " No need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing . " Glasgow is not the end of the world . And Mr. Harwood mentioned that they will be there a fortnight , staying at the Duke of Argyle , before they could sail for America . " I drew a deep breath . Should I go to Glasgow ? No , not  | even John would want me to do such an unwomanly thing as travel more than a hundred miles to throw myself in his arms . But two weeks would be ample time for him to receive my letter and to send a reply  --  or , what was much more likely , to come hurrying back to Inverness . Aunt Dora was waiting just inside the door when I reached the house . I said , " They have gone . " As she lost color , I added , " It is all right . They will be staying at a Glasgow inn for a fortnight . I can write to him . " By the next day 's post , I sent the letter . It was a complete capitulation . I wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southampton or anyplace else he chose , and that I would strive to do so cheerfully , betraying no bitterness to our neighbors over their treatment of my father , and praying that in time all bitterness would vanish from my heart . The next few days were happy , busy ones . Out of contrition for her part in my near disaster , as well as out of love for me , Aunt Dora summoned three sempstresses and set them to work on a trousseau  --  sheets , pillowcases , nightdresses , and shifts of such finely woven linen and silk that I knew they would be an embarrassment to me in that homespun Long Island village . For his part , Ian MacElvin told me that he had placed five thousand pounds to my credit in the Inverness bank . " Legally , of course , any property of yours will become your husband 's . But John Harwood did not strike me as the sort of man who would spend his wife 's money without her consent . " When five days had passed , I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our door . And even if he had been unable to leave Glasgow immediately , I told myself , he would have sent a letter by now .  | On the eighth day the letter arrived . I hurried up to my room with it , closed the door , and sank into a chair . With shaking fingers I tore open the envelope and folded the single sheet of paper inside . He had written : " The captain of the ship upon which we reserved passage has readied his cargo sooner than expected . When you receive this letter , we will be at sea . " By the time I received your letter , Elizabeth , it was already too late . During the journey from Inverness to Glasgow , I asked Charity to be my wife . The captain will marry us soon after we sail . I must do this . You know that I must . I could not break my troth with any woman , once I had made it , let alone a good and gentle woman like Charity . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I warned you . Why were you so strong-headed ? And once you had embarked upon strong-headedness , why did you turn back and write that letter to me ? I have destroyed it , lest by some chance Charity see it . But every word of it will remain in my memory . That letter will make it all the harder to achieve the modest contentment I had hoped to find with Charity . " If there were any way , any way at all , for me to be with you now , I would be . You know that . And you know that I wish you well . There is nothing more for me to say . " I do not know how much time passed before Aunt Dora knocked at my door . Receiving no answer , she came in and looked at me as I sat there , John 's letter still in my hand . She said , her eyes appalled , " Oh , Elizabeth ! " Unable to speak , I handed her the letter . When she had  | finished reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it is my fault . If I had not advised you ? " " No . " I roused myself . " Even if you had not so advised me , I would have tested his will against mine . I would have done so , not out of sheer stubbornness , but because I believed common sense was on my side . " But common sense , I reflected , might prove a cold bedfellow in the years to come . After several seconds she said , " What do you want to do ? " " I would rather not stay here for the present . " Not here , where for several days now I had been expecting to see him coming up the street , when all the time a ship was carrying him and his wife farther and farther across the Atlantic . " Do you want to return to Bowain Castle , then ? " I shook my head . Instinctively I knew that right then the beauty of mountain and sea and moorland would seem a mockery of my pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist her hands together . " I do n't know what to do . You can not stay in the London house with no one but servants there . And Ian and I must go to Trinidad to be with Martha soon . " Martha was the too-delicate wife of the MacElvins ' eldest and favorite son . Married for twelve years , she would soon , if all went well , present her husband with their first child , and the Ian MacElvins with their sixth grandchild . Her face brightened somewhat . " I know ! There is Cousin Gertrude . She could chaperon you . " Aunt Dora 's distant cousin , Gertrude MacKay , was an aged and impoverished widow who lived in a small Inverness house owned by Ian MacElvin . She also , I suspected , lived  | chiefly off Ian 's bounty . " Very well . " " Oh , Elizabeth ! " She took a step toward me . " Please , " I said . " Please do n't . " I felt that if she put her arms around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said , " As you wish , dear , " and left me . Soon after the clock struck ten that night , I descended the stairs . ( At its own last striking , how many bells had that ship 's clock sounded ? Surely the ship was still close enough to Europe that it sailed through darkness . Had John and Charity gone to their cabin ? ) As I entered the library , my guardian laid his book aside and rose to his feet . I said , " Since I am not to be married , I would like for you to take back your gift of five thousand pounds . " He kissed my cheek . " No , Elizabeth . You are a mature woman now . I believe a woman should have some money of her own . " Especially a woman who seemed likely to live out her life as a spinster . He did not say that , but I could see the sad thought in his eyes .  | I had never been fond of the MacElvins ' London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me more friendly . But at least the Russell Square house , with its sweeping marble staircase and its ballroom lighted by crystal chandeliers , held no vivid memories for me , painful or otherwise . Cousin Gertrude and I spent our first days there quietly . Each morning we went for a drive , she with her ear trumpet at hand and smiling vaguely out of the coach window . In the afternoons , while she slept , I again took the air . Usually the coachman , at my direction , drove down the Mall past St. James Palace , and then by a circuitous route through Hyde Park and back to Russell Square . Even though some of Aunt Dora 's friends , notified by her that I was in London , sent invitations to evening parties , I could not accept them , not when Cousin Gertrude retired promptly at eight o'clock each night . But we did take morning coffee at several houses . And when we had been in London a little more than a week , Lady Carter , an old friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St.  | James Palace . We waited in line in an anteroom until we were admitted to the presence of His Majesty , King George the Second . He was a fat little man with somewhat ribald eyes . When it was my turn to curtsy , he grasped my hand to raise me to my feet . Then , as was his custom when a woman presented to him caught his fancy , he kissed me on the mouth with his plump , rather moist lips . I wondered how many other women had had to restrain the impulse to raise a gloved wrist and wipe the royal kiss from their mouths . With morning and afternoon drives , and chatter over coffee cups about fashions and scandals , I lived through the days without too much difficulty . It was the evenings that seemed endless . In the sitting room which adjoined my bedroom , I would settle down determinedly to read . But soon , finding that the words made no sense , I would lay the book aside and give myself up to torturing thoughts of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind had favored them , they were already in Boston . Soon the senior Harwoods , overjoyed that their son had turned away from his long attachment to Walter Logan 's willful daughter , would welcome the bridal pair to that farmhouse on the hill . It was midway of my third week in London that I looked out of my coach one day and saw an old friend . Afternoon traffic was more congested than usual along the Mall that day . As my coach , one of a long line , rolled at a snail 's pace down the broad avenue , I became aware of three fashionably dressed men sauntering along the sidewalk . Behind them trailed a small , motley crowd , its members ranging from Londoners as well-dressed as the men they followed to several ragged urchins who looked  | like chimney sweeps . The tallest of the three men , resplendent in blond peruke and brown velvet coat and breeches , was plainly the object of the crowd 's curiosity . With startled disbelief , I realized that he was Charles Edward . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his friends . Then he was out in the roadway , opening the door of my coach . " May I ? " I was so glad to see him that it astonished me . " Oh , yes ! " When he was on the seat opposite me , he leaned out the window , waved to the curious crowd , and called to his two companions , " Go on to Lady Primrose 's house . I will join you there . " He leaned back in the corner and said , as the coach crawled forward " The last time I saw you , you looked like a small rat dragged out of the swamp . " " And you looked like Robinson Crusoe . " He laughed . I saw now that although he was still handsome , he was less lean than I remembered . There were lines at the corners of his brown eyes , and a hint of dissipated fullness beneath them . But the eyes themselves still held that cheerful friendliness . His appreciative gaze was taking in my green velvet gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach 's rosewood interior with its mother-of-pearl inlays . " I told you that your face would be your fortune . Your husband must be very rich indeed . " I said , hoping that no pain showed in my face , " I have no husband . " He arched his eyebrows eloquently . I felt color in my cheeks . " And no  --  benefactor , at least not of the sort you have in mind . You see , it was discov-  | ered that I do have Macduveen blood . My father was illegitimate , unfortunately , but still his father was a Macduveen . " " It was discovered ? How ? " " A man who was once in love with my natural greataunt , Arabella Macduveen , saw how much I resembled her . He and his wife are now my guardians , although I spend more time at Castle Bowain than with them . " " You see ? I was right . Your face was your fortune . Tell me , do you still have that coat button I gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel box . " He leaned forward . " Please take supper with me . There is a splendid little inn on the road to Richmond ? " " You know that is impossible . " " Would n't you enjoy an hour 's conversation with an old friend ? Are n't you at least a little curious as to why you find me here , sauntering about the Hanoverian 's capital ? " " Of course . But I can not have supper with you at an inn , and not only for reasons of propriety . The Macduveens are all Whigs and Protestants . So are my guardians , the MacElvins . What would they say if they heard I had been seen having supper with Charles Stuart ? I only hope no one who knows me saw you get into this coach . Probably no one did . My acquaintanceship in London is not wide . " He took my hand between both of his , and I , enjoying the warmth of his touch , allowed it to remain there . " Please , Elizabeth ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink a toast together to auld lang syne and to Bowain Wood ? " I still felt drawn to him , this handsome young man who wore his fine clothes as debonairly , but not more so , as he  | had worn a frayed coat and kilt . And that day in Bowain Wood he had provided more than a warm fire , and brandy , and a button from his coat . At a time when I was of about as much consequence to others as the courtyard cat , and when he himself was hard-pressed indeed , he had concerned himself with what was to become of me . And so I sat silent , considering his request . Once Cousin Gertrude had laid her ear trumpet aside and gone to bed , not even a cannon shot would arouse her , let alone the arrival of a guest . Nor would the servants need to know who had visited me . After they , at my request , had set out a light supper  --  not in the huge dining room , but in my sitting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismiss them . The coach had left the crowded Mall new and was moving at a brisker pace along Whitehall . " Could you come to the MacElvin house in Russell Square ? It would be best if you came quite late . " " Ten o'clock ? " " Yes . " I gave him the house number . " Thank you , Elizabeth . I will be there . And now , if you will ask your coachman to drive to Lady Primrose 's ... " He did not leave the coach directly in front of Lady Primrose 's house . As he himself pointed out , she had been a well-known  --  some would say notorious  --  enthusiast for the Stuart cause . For my coach even to stop at her house , let alone disgorge Charles Edward Stuart , would give rise to speculation that I was a secret Jacobite . And so he left me about a hundred yards away from the house , with its long line of coaches and sedan chairs waiting before it . My own coach turned around . I rode back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had for many days . By eleven that night , Charles and I had consumed all of the turtle soup I had served from a candle-heated tureen , and much of the cold joint and salad , and all but one of three bottles of wine . It had been a merry meal . Almost exclusively , he had talked of his fugitive days in the Highlands . He chuckled over his masquerade as the Irish giantess , Betty Burke , and spoke with affection of the Seven Men of Glenmoriston , those self-proclaimed outlaws who at one period , until the Redcoats drew too close , had provided him with what seemed almost royal comforts in a spacious mountain cave . He did not speak of the campaign that had led up to the disaster at Culloden , nor of his life since he had sailed away from Scotland . With wonder , I realized that for him the high point of his life had been those perilous days when , often cold and hungry , he had eluded capture . At last I asked , " How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a written invitation from St. James , you may be sure . " He leaned back in the small red velvet sofa on which he sat , and looked at me wryly across the littered table . " Nevertheless , the English ambassador at Versailles did drop a hint that if I visited London , I would not be clapped into the Tower . I think George wanted me to see what little chance I have of rallying support here . " When he did not go on , I asked tentatively , " And ? " " I have seen what he wanted me to . Lady Primrose and a few others have overwhelmed me with invitations and with expression of undying loyalty . But it is only talk . " He looked suddenly tired and older than he had a few minutes before . For the first time I noticed that his red  | hair , not covered tonight by the blond peruke , had a few threads of gray . " But you still have hopes that your father ? " " Will sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must still make the gestures , must still travel about Europe begging for men and arms . I am James Stuart 's son . What else is left for me to be , or do ? " I thought of the lines my father had so often quoted : There is a tide in the affairs of men , Which taken at the flood , leads on to fortune . But it was the next two lines which described what had happened to the man who sat opposite me : Omitted , all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries . His tide had reached its flood at Derby , with the way to London open before his victorious Highlanders . But he had been persuaded to turn back . And now he was stranded in the shallows , perhaps forever . He straightened his shoulders , as if throwing off burdensome thoughts . " And now I have a question for you . " Once more his eyes were warm and teasing . " How is it that the beauteous Elizabeth Logan , ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tried to smile . " Because I have not married . " " Do n't fence with an old friend . Has no man won your heart ? " Pain was tightening my throat . " Yes , one has . " " Well ? " " He married someone else . " He looked at me wonderingly . " I should like to see her .  | She must he ravishing indeed . " " No . " It was hard to breathe now . " She is plain , and very quiet . " " Then why ? " " Because she had what I do not have ! Good sense ! " The tears came in a flood . I crossed my arms on the table and pillowed my head upon them . I felt his hands lifting me from my chair . He led me , sobbing , to the sofa , and drew me down into his arms . " Poor Elizabeth . Poor fledgling . Tell me about it . " Crying in his arms , I told him . My refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banishment . The years when I had gone on loving him despite little or no hope of ever seeing him again . My second chance , in Inverness , to marry him , and my failure to grasp it in time . Stroking my hair , Charles said in a flat voice , " Once the stone is cast , there is no end to the ripples , is there ? Because I landed in Scotland , an American I never heard of was banished from a village I never heard of , and his daughter . . . " He broke off . With his handkerchief he dried my face . He kissed me on the forehead and then , more lingeringly , on the mouth . He said , " More than once these past years I have wondered if I would ever see you again . I hoped that if I did I would find you safe and happy . But perhaps there are no happy endings . " He looked down into my eyes . " Only happy intervals , now and then . " Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth on my mouth , of his hands through the thin silk of my dress , and of warmth spreading within me . My arms fastened around his neck . I had a sense of being swept  | along by many forces . The headiness of the wine . A stir of that old grief for my father , so fervent in the cause of the man holding me in his arms . Lonely despair over the happiness I had thrown away . And the growing passion aroused by Charles 's hands and lips . He raised his head and looked down at me . His eyes had changed . Instinctively I was aware that now they were the eyes of a practiced seducer , judging whether or not the moment was right . But that did not seem to matter . I did not protest as he lifted me in his arms and carried me through the doorway to my bed . When at last we lay quiet , he leaned his head on his elbow-propped hand . Light from the sitting room chandelier gleamed on his bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know . " " That I had had no lover ? " " Yes . Many women of my acquaintance these past few years ? Well , that is no matter . But I realize now that your unhappiness gave me an unfair advantage . " I could not talk of John . Anyone or anything but him . " I should think that you have found little need of added advantages . " His tone was self-mocking . " Oh , yes . Bonnie Prince Charlie . I have read some of those ballads . " Then , soberly : " I can not marry you , Elizabeth . Whether I like it or not , I am a prince . My father was the son of an anointed sovereign , who in turn was the descendant of a long line of anointed sovereigns . When I marry , it must be with some woman of similar lineage , so that my son may have hope of gaining the British throne , even though that hope has grown thin indeed for my father and for me. "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent , winding a tendril of my hair around one finger . Then he said , " But come with me to the Continent tomorrow . Or join me there as soon as possible . Except that we can not marry , I will do everything in my power to make you happy . " In my loneliness and sorrow , it was a temptation , but not a great one . I pictured what my life would be as Charles Edward 's mistress , wandering with him , a man already too much given to drink , from one capital to another . To annoy the English , some monarch would treat him with the outward respect due royalty . But in the manners I would encounter , the veneer of respect , if there at all , would be thin indeed . Besides , it was said that he already had a mistress , a certain Clementia Walkinshaw . . . " No , Charles . I could not bear to have some lawfully married Countess turn her back on me  --  or have her husband whisper invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You are right , little one . Both those things would happen . And I , whose duty it is to make friends , not enemies , would be able to do little to stop it . " He bent his head and kissed me , gently at first , and then with growing urgency . No happy endings , I thought , only happy intervals . With my lips responding to his , I clasped my arms around his neck .  | For three weeks more I stayed in the Russell Square house . Cousin Gertrude and I continued to take morning coffee in various drawing rooms , although for me the chatter about gowns and balls and courtships and other people 's marital transgressions long since had become wearisome . I went driving twice a day . The leaves on the trees bordering the Mall had become fewer each day , but the coaches and sedan chairs moving beneath them even more numerous . Many Londoners who had spent the summer at their country houses had returned to town . In the long evenings I still found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had turned several pages without absorbing a word . Instead I had been thinking of John and Charity . No doubt they were occupying an upstairs room at the senior Harwoods ' house . But had John begun to build the house he and I had planned , the one farther along the hill , with a view of the sloping fields and the bay ? I did not think of Charles Edward often , and when I did it was with no strong emotion , neither sharp regret for my  | transgression , nor longing to repeat it . Perhaps because I had always been aware of the great gulf between us  --  yes , even when he was a ragged fugitive  --  those hours I had spent in his arms seemed unreal to me , like a dream I 'd had many nights ago . One morning I awoke , went to my window , and saw London fog , stained with smoke from thousands of chimneys , shrouding the almost naked trees in the garden . Suddenly I was seized with longing for the springiness of heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep blue of lochs . At breakfast I suggested to Cousin Gertrude that we leave London . Her eager acquiescence made me ashamed of myself . She told me , poor lady , that she had been worrying that the leaky roof of her little house in Inverness might be ruining her possessions . Locked in my own concerns , I had not realized that she wanted to go home . We set out two days later . Since the MacElvins were still away in the West Indies , I spent one night in Cousin Gertrude 's house . Fortunately there had not been enough rain for that leak to cause damage . The next morning I set out for Bowain Castle , traveling through the Great Glen along the road that bordered the wide waters of Loch Ness , mirror-smooth on this still day . When I saw the cloud-wreathed bulk of Ben Nevis standing like a guard at the entrance to what I thought of as " my " Highlands , my heart swelled with something almost like happiness . My thoughts sped ahead to my usual homecoming ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then hurrying out to the stables to see Angus , who still called me " lass , " and then to the kitchen to greet  | Jenny , who now called me " milady . " I had long since made my peace with her . To my surprise , she had confessed readily that she had known I was a Macduveen the moment she saw me . Nor did she , as I had anticipated , try to excuse her silence on the ground that she had not wanted to burden me with the knowledge of my grandmother 's " shame . " Instead she said forthrightly , " I could not abide that saint-praying woman , or that saucy brat of hers , Walter Logan . If her granddaughter and his daughter was to join the gentry , it was not going to be any of my doing . And if it was a sin to keep silent , it will just have to be on my soul . " Outrageous as I found her words , I could not help but respect her for refusing to disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after I became Ian MacElvin 's ward , Mag had run away with a handsome tinker , one of a band of gypsies who had crossed the English border to wander in the Highlands . When I reached Bowain Castle , I found that even though Donald was absent , Lady Macduveen was not alone . Clarence MacElvin and his wife were there , and had been for several weeks , ever since their manor house had been severely damaged by a fire . I was not dismayed by their presence , even though from the first I had never taken to my guardian 's older brother , and had liked him even less after his first wife 's diary had come into my possession . I would still have my room and the whole outdoors to wander through . Too , the evening meals , taken in Lady Macduveen 's sitting room rather than in the big dining hall with its cavernous fireplace , had always been uncomfortable when there was just Lady Macduveen and  | myself breaking long silences with trivial conversation . Perhaps the visitors ' presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . With the MacElvins at table , the talk usually turned to politics , a subject which seemed of even greater interest to Mrs. MacElvin than to her husband . Like most landed aristocrats  --  her father , I had learned , was an eighth baron , with extensive lands near Edinburgh  --  she was a staunch Whig . She distrusted that fast-rising statesman , William Pitt , " a wayward Whig , if he is a Whig at all , " and still mourned the great Whig Robert Walpole . One evening her talk ranged back thirty-five years to the Stuart Rising of 1715 , and to Walpole 's firm support at that time of the first Hanoverian monarch , George the First . Since she was obviously several years younger than her husband , she could not have been more than fourteen or fifteen at that time . But from the knowledgeable way in which she spoke , one might have thought that she herself had been on the battlefield at Preston , administering a sound drubbing to all the Stuart forces , including an ex-potboy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , her dark eyes flashing . " At that time there were Protestant Scotsmen , even friends of my father 's , who supported the Rebels . Not for love of the Stuarts , you may be sure . It was love of French gold that impelled them , and hope that a victorious Stuart king would reward them with their neighbors ' lands . " Clarence MacElvin said , " They say that the young Pretender was in London a few weeks ago , strolling along the Mall with a gawking crowd at his heels . " Lady Macduveen said , " Did you hear about that , Elizabeth , while you were in London ? "  | My nerves tightened . Had someone , after all , recognized me that day Charles got into my coach ? But the three faces turned toward me held nothing but casual interest . " Yes , I heard that he had been in London . " " They also say , " Clarence went on , " that he attended a church service at St. Mary 's in the Strand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate to the English people that the Stuarts would be tolerant of Protestantism . " Lady Macduveen said , " You and Clarence were married in that church , were you not ? " Mrs. MacElvin nodded . " Six years ago last month . " I felt startled . Perhaps because they were both middleaged , I had assumed they had been married for many years . Why , I wondered , had he waited for so long after Arabella 's death to remarry ? It must have been four or five days after that supper table conversation that Donald Macduveen returned for one of his sojourns beneath the ancestral roof . During the past few years he had grown plumper and plumper , so that now he was undeniably fat . But as his girth had increased , the hostility between us had lessened . We were both still young , beneath a roof that sheltered otherwise only middle-aged and elderly gentry and servants . A wider experience of the world had shown me that his behavior toward me that first night , however detestable , was not untypical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for those painful slurs he had cast upon my appearance  --  well , I had observed by now that affronted male self-esteem , as well as female , could lash out cruelly . And so , if we were not friends , we were at least friendly enough that , when Mrs. MacElvin launched into one of  | her diatribes against Pitt , his eyes and mine could meet in veiled amusement . He had been at home more than a week when I encountered him on the moor one morning . I had just spent half an hour or so beside my father 's grave . As I emerged from the little grove near the grassy clearing , I heard a dog barking . Then I saw it about a quarter of a mile away , straining at a leash held by a young boy . Donald 's portly figure , standing beside a sleek bay horse from the castle stable , was recognizable even at that distance . So was Murdock , his hunched figure astride the pony he kept beside the round tower , long beard streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Donald held a hooded hawk perched on his leather-gloved fist . He turned to me , smiling . " Good morning , Elizabeth . " His gaze returned to the hawk . " Is n't she beautiful ? " I looked at the hooded , motionless head , the broad breast streaked with black and white , the folded dark wings , the greenish feet with their hooked talons gripping Donald 's gloved fist . " What sort of hawk is it ? " " A peregrine falcon , and a fine one . " " From the round tower ? " I looked at Murdock . As I had expected , he glared back at me . " Of course not . " Donald sounded irritated . " Will MacCullen loaned her to me . " Will MacCullen was one of Donald 's drinking companions . " Will loaned me the dog , too . We used to keep hunting dogs , until Mother decided they were a useless expense . " He did not mention the shylooking , sandy-haired boy , although I was sure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with growing anger , " I find that our hawks are no longer fit for flying . Murdock should have  | flown them regularly . " The old man was glaring at Donald now . I felt sorry for the falcon keeper . Why should he , enfeebled with age , have exerted himself to keep the hawks in condition ? As far as I knew , this was the first time since I had come to Bowain Castle that the young laird had gone hawking . Too , perhaps the old man had feared to lose his only companions if he launched them into the air . I knew little of falconry , but I did know that sometimes the freed bird does not return to the fist . His ill humor apparently vented , Donald turned to me with a smile . " Would you like to see me fly her ? There is a wood pigeon over in that clump of gorse . " I looked from the peregrine 's curved talons to the straining dog and then back again . " No , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elizabeth . It is the hawk 's nature . And she is beautiful in the air . " Reluctant and yet fascinated , I watched Donald pull the hood from the dark head with its fierce , curved beak and , with a shout of " Wait on ! " fling his arm upward . The hawk rose , straight up with legs dangling for a moment , and then in slow circles , each circle carrying her higher . As I watched , head back , I had the sensation that Arabella had described in her diary  --  a sense that it was I up there , feeling the thrust of air under slowly beating wings . The hawk was so high now that she looked no larger than a swallow . A few moments later I understood the phrase " Wait on ! " While the unleashed dog dashed to the gorse clump and circled it , barking , the hawk continued to make her silent , waiting circles against the brilliant sky . With a clatter of wings , the wood pigeon flew upward  | from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering assassin , because it began a frantic , evasive flight , gliding downward at an angle with wings almost closed , then rising steeply to glide in another direction . " Watch the hawk ! " Donald directed . Then , as I looked upward : " She has turned on her back now . Here is the stoop ! " She was hurtling toward earth , head downward , growing larger each fraction of a second . I saw , or thought I saw , one of her talons strike at the pigeon . But the quarry , in a steep glide , temporarily escaped death . The falcon plunged on and then , checking her descent , began to mount higher and higher in those slow circles . I cried , " The pigeon ! Where is it ? " " In that other clump of gorse over there . " He looked up at the circling hawk . " I will serve her as soon as she reaches her point . " " Serve her ? " " Flush the quarry out again . The hawk will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exausted bird huddled with laboring heart . " Oh , Donald ! It tried so hard . It so wants to live . Ca n't you allow it to ? " " And spoil the hawk ? Do n't talk nonsense . " He nodded to the sandy-haired boy . The boy , who had called the dog back to him when the pigeon rose , again unfastened the leash . The dog dashed to another and more distant clump of gorse and barked until the pigeon again rose and began its evasive flight . But it was obviously tired now , its steep climbs short , its slanting glides less swift . The falcon plunged . Unable to look away , I saw the talons seize the pigeon and bear it earthward.  | " She is about a quarter of a mile away , " Donald said . " Wait here . " He mounted the horse and set off at a brisk trot over the moor . I waited with the boy and with Murdock , who seemed to be trying to pretend that I was not there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hooded after her meal , on his fist . The boy lifted from the ground a contraption which Donald referred to as a " cadge , " a wooden framework consisting of two poles joined at one end by a wide , flat piece of wood . A leather strap , long enough that the boy could slip it over one shoulder , ran slantwise between the poles . While the boy stood in the cadge , rather like a horse between two shafts , Donald placed the hooded falcon on the platform and tied its leash through a hole in the board . As the boy , followed by the dog , moved off toward Bowain Castle , Donald called after him , " Take care you do n't jostle her too much in the cart ! And tell your master I had fine sport . " He turned to me . " Would you like to see the hawks in the tower ? Murdock has ruined them , of course , but they still might interest you . " The old man , toothless mouth working , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slur on his custodianship or my proposed visit , I did not know . Donald said , laughing , " Go to the devil , you old idiot . " Murdock jerked his pony around , dug his heels into its sides , and galloped toward the tower . Again Donald laughed . " Come on . You can ride pillion . " I hesitated . " He seems very angry . " " What matter if he is ? It is not his tower , or his falcons . " " Could n't we walk there ? It is only about half a mile . "  | " Why walk ? " As he lifted me onto the pillion , I reflected that it was little wonder that he was fatter each time I saw him . Even when he did venture out for a day of sport , he exerted himself as little as possible . As the horse moved slowly across the moor , Donald said in a voice that blended sympathy with curiosity , " Mother tells me that you went to London because you had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know in America . I was sorry to hear it . " So Aunt Dora must have written to Bowain Castle to explain my stay in London . Lady Macduveen had never mentioned the letter to me . I knew that her silence had arisen , not from delicacy , but a refusal to become involved in anyone else 's pain . I said , " Yes , but I would rather not talk about it . " " All right . I will talk about something more cheerful . Someone told Will MacCullen that Charles Stuart was seen getting into your coach on the Mall . " He must have heard my swift intake of breath , because he added , " Do n't worry . I have not told Mother . And I certainly will not tell Clarence MacElvin and that Jacobiteeating wife of his . " He paused . " Or do n't you want to talk about Stuart , either ? " I did not , and not just because I feared talk of the London episode might reach the ears of the Clarence MacElvins and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom in the Russell Square house no longer seemed like a fading dream . Of late I 'd had reason to think of it often , and uneasily . I said , " There is nothing to tell . He left the coach near Lady Primrose 's house , and then I went home . " I continued swiftly , " You mentioned the MacElvins . The  | other night I learned that they had been married for only six years . I wonder why Clarence MacElvin remained unmarried for so long after his first wife 's death . " Donald laughed . " Probably he was waiting to find a woman with sufficiently good prospects . Her father is almost eighty , and a very rich man . " Donald 's surmise struck me as probably correct . Clarence MacElvin 's first marriage to a beautiful and unwilling young woman had ended in tragedy . It was little wonder that he had chosen as his second wife an heiress in her forties . We had reached the round tower . Donald dismounted , helped me to the ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pen . The pony wore a collar , I saw now , which consisted of a cloth-padded chain . Attached to the collar was another chain which ran to an iron ring set in the tower 's rounded wall . Following the direction of my gaze , Donald said , " Murdock has always been afraid someone will steal that bag of bones . He keeps it chained up like that and hides the key somewhere in the tower . " Moving to the wide wooden door , he pulled the latchstring . The door did not swing open . " Damn the old fool ! " He hammered with his fist . " Murdock ! Unbar the door ! " After a moment I heard the grate of wood against wood . The door swung open . Murdock stood there in an arc of sunlight . He looked , not angry now , but merely sullen . Turning his back on us , he walked to a stool set against the curving stone wall , sat down , and crossed his arms over his chest . Donald left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , near the entrance to the stairs ,  | stood a wooden rake and shovel , intended for use , I suppose , in keeping the dirt floor clean . But Murdock must have employed them seldom , because the room smelled strongly of bird droppings , as well as of Murdock . Even I could tell that the hawks , moving restlessly on their long perch and blinking in the unaccustomed sunlight , were not healthy . They were lusterless both of eye and plumage . Donald identified them for me . There was a small hobby and an even smaller merlin , " good only for flying at larks . " There was a huge gyrfalcon , its white plumage dotted with black , and a peregrine falcon so dull of feather that I scarcely would have recognized it as the same sort of bird that had hurtled from the sky to seize the pigeon in its talons . At last I said , " Could I see the rest of the tower ? " As I spoke , I glanced at Murdock , half expecting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this further violation of what he plainly considered his property . Instead , he merely glowered at me . Donald shrugged . " There is not much to see  --  only three rooms , one on each floor . " We went up curving stairs , their stone steps hollowed out by the feet of armed defenders and perhaps invaders , centuries dead . The room directly above the falcons ' lair was unmistakably Murdock 's . I stood in the doorway , breathing shallowly in the fetid air . Sunlight , slanting through the arrow slits , showed me his bed  --  a pallet and a tangle of blanket  --  on the floor strewn with straw . Beneath one of the arrow slits stood a small iron brazier . Probably he used it , not only for cooking , but to combat the bonechilling cold of winter . Gladly I turned away and followed Donald up to the  | next room . Its door was closed , but opened easily under his hand . I peered in at iron-bound wooden chests , their lids piled with wooden boxes and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained similar chests and storage boxes . I asked , " Did you ever look into all of those containers ? " " Yes , when I was fifteen . Mostly they hold dresses and coats and breeches so fallen to pieces that my grandmother must have had them placed here . But I did find two old swords and a pistol . Those I took away with me . " He laughed . " When Murdock came up to see what I had been doing , he was so angry that I thought he was going to fly at me with his fists . " We climbed the last flight of stairs and opened a heavy wooden door onto the slate-covered roof . As the door swung to behind us , I noticed that there was a heavy iron bar affixed to the wood , rusting in its brackets . I said , " I wonder why they wanted to bar this door from the out-side ? " " I suppose in the event the tower 's defenders were driven up to the roof . With the door barred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final stand . " It was hard to realize that this tower , empty now except for an old man , drooping falcons , and chests and boxes of moldering garments , had once echoed to the clash of swords and the shouts of men fighting on stone stairs slippery with blood . Donald had moved over to the deeply crenelated parapet . I joined him and looked down the sheer drop of sixty feet . " Until I was about eighteen , " he said , " I used to climb from here to the ground whenever the notion  | struck me . " It seemed incredible that the man beside me had ever been slender and agile enough to perform such a feat . " Was n't that very dangerous ? " " Not as dangerous as you might think . You can see there are crevices between the stones . They were my fingerholds and toeholds . And in some places the outward course of stones had fallen away entirely . Too , you can see how the base of the tower begins to slope outward about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that far , the rest of the descent was not difficult . " Besides , " he went on , " sometimes I held onto a rope while I went from one foothold to another . " He looked to his right and then laughed . " Why , part of it is still there ! " I looked at the once-stout rope , one of its ends tied through a ring bolt affixed to the top of a crenelation . From there it dangled , sun-bleached to a pale yellow and frayed in many places , to a point a few feet above where the tower began to widen . I imagined the young and slender Donald descending along that rope , feet searching for crevices and hollows in the rocky wall . . . . Dizziness assailed me . I clung to the parapet with both hands . He said in an alarmed voice , " Are you going to faint ? You 're as white as a fish 's belly . " I turned and leaned my back against the parapet . Nausea was stirring in me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " " You should not have looked down . Evidently you have a poor head for heights . " I had an excellent head for heights . Only last summer I had climbed up a narrow glen , made my way along a ridge  | to a bluff overlooking the loch where Arabella had drowned herself , and sat there on a wide , sun-warmed rock which projected from the face of the bluff . " We had best go down , " Donald said . " Yes , that would be best . "  | On a lowering afternoon nearly two weeks later , I stood at the window of my room , forcing myself to think calmly of my future . For more than a week now , I had awakened each morning to the grim certainty that I was with child . At first the knowledge had sent my thoughts scattering in panic . After that there had been days of useless regret , when I walked over the moors wondering if any other woman had committed two such follies in the space of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against that of the man I loved , and then succumbing utterly to a man I merely liked  --  it seemed to me that the first folly was the greater , because it had prepared me for the second . Charles Edward had been right . My lonely unhappiness , rendering me reckless , had been his ally that night . But now , since I had no intention of following Arabella into that Ioch , I had set myself to considering the other alternatives before me . I could seek out Charles Edward on the Continent . But I sensed that his emotions , although strong , were evanescent , at least where women were con-  | cerned . Because he was generous , he would befriend me . But he would not welcome the arrival of a pregnant young woman who , more than likely , had been crowded from his thoughts now by his mistress and perhaps by other women . Besides , since I had rejected the idea of myself as part of his idle , wandering life , how could I accept it for my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bowain Castle . Unwilling to concern herself with even the minor troubles of others , Lady Macduveen would never tolerate my embarrassing presence during the time ahead . Nor would it be fair to inflict myself upon my guardians , even if they allowed me to , which they well might not . I felt that , fond as they were of me , there was a distinct possibility that now they would disown me . But of one thing I felt sure . Neither Ian MacElvin nor Aunt Dora would want to strip me of that five thousand pounds . Properly invested , it would support my child and me in modest comfort . But support us where ? Obviously in some place where I might represent myself as a widow . Scotland was not such a place , or even London , since I was known to friends of my guardians there . I would have to cross the Channel to some city in France or the Low Countries . Perhaps in time I would meet some quiet , decent man who would want to become a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm my decision brought me was a bleak one . It would be hard indeed to leave foaming burns , and mountains changing in the ever-changing light , and heather underfoot , for lodgings on a gray street in some foreign city . How still everything was . Except for the crackle of a small fire on the hearth , the room seemed as silent as the  | snow which had begun to fall in large , widely spaced flakes past the window . Down in the kitchen , pots must be banging , and perhaps Jennie was berating Morag , a timid woman with a harelip who had replaced the errant Mag . But no sounds from below or from the courtyard penetrated this room . Nor did I , as I often did at this hour , hear the notes of the spinet in Lady Macduveen 's apartment , or Donald 's heavy tread in the hall , or Belzebub 's deep , bell-like bark . Lady Macduveen , one of the servants had told me , was confined to her bed by a headache . As for Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repairs on their fire-damaged house . I had seen the coach depart that morning for the eightmile journey , with the giant hound trotting beside the horses . Such silence was oppressive . Best to go out , even though snow was falling and the short November day nearing its end . Always I had found that out of doors my heart was a little less heavy . I put on a fur-hooded cloak , walked down the corridor past the dining hall where a fire burned in the huge fireplace , past the closed door to Lady Macduveen 's rooms , and down the circular stairs to the entrance tunnel that ran through the castle 's thick foundation . When I emerged from it , I found that what wind there was blew from the east , slanting snowflakes into my face . I walked with lowered head down the narrow road leading to the highroad . With my gaze fixed on the thin layer of snow underfoot , I was unaware of an approaching coach until I heard the sound of its wheels . I moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald drive past . A moment later I saw that the coach was smaller than the MacElvins ' , and drawn by one roan horse and one bay , rather than the MacElvins ' matched grays . Then I saw the face looking out at me from the window . After seeming to stop for a moment , my heart set up a wild , incredulous pounding .  | The coach traveled a few more yards before it stopped . The door opened , and he strode toward me , his face so alight with joy that I went , heedless , straight into his arms . He kissed me , and then stood pressing my head against his shoulder . Several moments passed before I even thought to ask , " Then you and Charity are not ? " " No . She broke our troth , Elizabeth ! I did not tell her of your letter , but she must have sensed that something had happened to make me regret having asked her to marry me . The day after the ship sailed from Glasgow , she told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone happiness . " Remembering the yearning look her gentle eyes had sent him across the MacElvins ' Inverness drawing room , I knew how much that decision must have cost her . " We were becalmed nearly a week , so it was already October by the time we reached Boston . I had to wait nearly two weeks for passage back to Glasgow . Then in Inverness I found the MacElvins ' house closed , and so I hired a coach in the hope I would find you here . " October . He had reached Boston in October . I had not left London until mid-October . Awareness of my situation returned to me , replacing that unthinking joy I had felt at first sight of him . I began to shiver . It must have been too dark for him to see my expression , because all he said was , " You are cold . We must get out of this snow . "  | In the coach he put his arm around me . I rested my head against his shoulder , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I even tried to pretend that I was the same as when we had parted , and that soon we would marry , and then I would go , not to some lonely lodging on a foreign street , but home to America with my husband . When the coach rattled over the stones paving the entrance tunnel , I stopped pretending . I lifted my head from his shoulder and straightened my disarranged hood . He asked , " Is there someplace where the coachman could spend the night ? " I said in a taut voice , " Best to have him wait here for a while . " John seemed to realize then that there was something wrong . Face worried , he handed me down from the coach and followed me up the stairs . In the corridor I said , " There is a fire in the dining hall . It will be warm there . " Fresh logs had been added to the fire . Evidently Lady Macduveen , because of her headache , intended to have her son and the Clarence MacElvins take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two high-backed chairs flanking the fireplace . " Please wait here . I will be back in a moment . " In my room I started to arrange two chairs before the fire as a drying rack for my damp cloak . Then , aware that I had been trying to delay the inevitable moment , I hung my cloak in the wardrobe and went back to the hall . As I entered , John rose from his chair beside the fire . He said in a voice harsh with anxiety , " Something is very wrong . Tell me ! " " Sit down , John . " I sat down in the chair opposite him ,  | and after a moment forced myself to begin to speak . After a few sentences I saw such incredulous pain in his face that I lowered my eyes . I did not look at him again until I had finished my account . I saw that his face was white , and his lips compressed into a thin line . He said , " And it was to hear this that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him wordlessly , he demanded , " Was it not enough to be the daughter of a bastard ? Do you have to give birth to one ? " He rose then and walked out . I huddled there , helpless to rise from the chair or make any movement at all . After a few moments I heard the hired coach rattle into the courtyard , turn , and go out through the tunnel .  | I do not know how long I sat there , hearing no sound but the hiss of logs in the grate . For the rest of my life I would see his face at that last moment , and hear his words . I loved him . If these past five years had taught me anything , it was that I would always love John Harwood . How could I live with the memory of loathing in his eyes ? It must have been such grinding misery as this which sent Arabella into the loch . The thought frightened me . I did not want to take my life and the life of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that it would moderate itself in time . But as I sat there , the pain did seem more than I could bear . I could not remain here . The torment would be no less , though , in my room  --  Arabella 's room . Arabella , who had lost whatever battle she herself had waged against despair . My father . All I had now was the memory of my father 's love and the hope of my unborn child 's . I would go to his grave . Up there I might find some assuagement . And I would see Arabella 's grave , reminding me of what  | could happen to those of insufficient strength . I went down the corridor and tapped softly on the door leading to Lady Macduvccn 's rooms . When one of the elderly maids opened the door , her face holding determination that her mistress not be disturbed , I said , " Will you please tell Lady Macduveen and the others that I will not be at table ? I feel unwell . " She nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a dry cloak from the wardrobe . Swiftly , lest I encounter the old footman moving toward the dining hall to set the long table , I walked down the corridor and descended the south tower stairs . When I reached the courtyard , I found that the temperature had dropped sharply . The kitchen door was closed on this cold night . So were the doors of the outbuildings beyond the courtyard , although from inside the carriage house came the clang of old Angus 's hammer , perhaps against a wheel rim . I went on past the last of the outbuildings and then started across the undulating moor . The snowfall , sparse to begin with , had almost ceased . I would not dare to stay long beside my father 's grave . If the cloud cover lifted , icy cold from the polar regions might settle down , that deadly cold which sometimes grips northern Scotland in the winter months . Already my cheekbones ached . I trudged on over the light , crisp snow cover , John 's face as it had looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far better , that he had married Charity . Then he and I would have been spared the ugliness of our last meeting . Aware that the dull gleam of the snow had brightened , I looked up . The polestar , so much higher in Scotland 's heavens than in Southampton 's , glittered against a black  | sky . I could also see , in a black lake bordered by tattered clouds , the gleam of Aldebaran , the red eye of the Bull . Lowering my gaze , I trudged on . I forced myself to think of the immediate future . It would be best to tell my guardian and Aunt Dora as soon as possible after they returned to Scotland . Once across the Channel , I would require time to find somewhere to live and to prepare for the birth of my child . A numb feeling , not unpleasant , had replaced the ache in my cheekbones . Even though I did not look up , I knew that more clouds had cleared from the star-brilliant sky . The white , undulating moor glittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change my name ? And if so , to what ? It was odd . So many names I might choose from , and the only one I could think of was Elizabeth Logan . Not only my face , but my mittened hands and my feet felt that pleasant numbness . And I was so drowsy . If I could just lie down for a few minutes , curled up in my cloak . . . Deep in my mind , a frantic alarm sounded . I looked at the grove of trees , black against the snow , which stood between me and my father 's grave . The grove with its inadequate shelter was at least half a mile ahead . I turned and looked at Bowain Castle , its dark bulk rising nearly three miles away above the seaward edge of the snow-whitened moor . Long before I retraced my steps , I would have succumbed to this drowsy prelude to death . I looked to my left . Only a few hundred yards away , light shone through arrow slits in the round tower . Murdock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal .  | I moved toward the tower as fast as I could , numb feet stumbling now and then . Once I blundered into a clump of frozen , snow-covered gorse , and had to free my cloak from its spiny grasp . As I approached the tower door , the shaggy pony , blanketed against the cold , poked his head over the top rail of his pen . I tried the latch , awkwardly grasping the string with my numb , mittened fingers . I heard the latch lift , but the door did not yield to the push of my other hand . The door was barred . I hammered with both fists against the wood . " Murdock ! It is Elizabeth Logan . Let me in ! " No sound for a moment . And then a harsh , inhuman cry . The gyrfalcon ? Perhaps . But the cry , although surely not uttered by a human throat , did not sound like that of any sort of bird . The cry was not repeated . Nor was there any sound of movement beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freeze out here , you will pay for it ! " Still no response . The crazy old man was going to let me die , only inches from shelter . I continued to pound , not so much from hope as to fight off that growing numbness . A grating sound as the bar slid back . The door opened . The upward-striking light of the lantern Murdock held made the eyes in his sullen face look like dark holes . I pushed past him into the fetid but blessedly warmer room . The birds moved restlessly on their perches . I said , " I am going to stay here until morning . " He shrugged , closed and barred the door , and pointed to the wooden stool against the wall . As I moved toward it , he walked to the foot of the stairs , set the lantern down on the floor , and started to climb the steps .  | It was then that I saw it , the shape of a narrow hand printed in some damp , sticky substance on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , the fingers were too long . Someone was up there . Somewhere in the tower , this crazy , hate-filled old man kept a human prisoner . " Mur-dock ! " Already on the third step of the stairs , he turned . Almost instantly I realized the folly of that impulsive cry . The mingled rage and fear in his face told me that he had read my own face , and knew that something had betrayed him . Paralyzed , I watched him come rapidly down the steps and seize the handle of the wooden shovel . But when he raised it above his head with both hands , the paralysis left me . As he rushed at me , I stooped , grasped the stool by one leg , and flung it straight at his head . He toppled backward , the shovel flying from his hands . I heard the hollow , sickening sound the back of his head made against the bottom step . One hand propped against the wall 's cold stones , I stood there for a moment , fighting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to cross to where he lay and kneel beside him . Blood was oozing now from a cut on his forehead . I removed one mitten and forced myself to thrust my hand beneath the sheepskin coat and his woolen shirt . His heart still beat , weakly but regularly . Without opening his eyes , he moved his head . My nerves tightened with fear , not for him now , but for myself . He might regain consciousness before I found the person who had uttered that inhuman cry and then , as a  | mute plea for help , had left that imprint on the back of his coat . I looked around . Hanging from an iron spike driven into the wall near the stair entrance was a coil of rope . I took it down and bound him as securely as I could , first the bony old wrists , and then the ankles in their dirtencrusted woolen stockings . I picked up the lantern and mounted the stairs . Holding the lantern high , I stood in the doorway of Murdock 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pallet with its tangled blankets , and the brazier in which a fire smoldered , giving off the acrid smell of peat . I went up to the next flight . Here the door had been closed from the outside with a wooden bar . The bar slid back under my hand , and the door swung inward . Lantern light glittered on the eyes of the woman huddled on the floor , and shone dully on her long , tangled gray hair and the iron gag distorting her mouth . Unable to move , I thought , " Why , she is so very old ! " Somehow , as I climbed the stairs , I had been thinking of Murdock 's stepdaughter , the " poor , motherless girl with hair as lusterless as dried straw " whom Arabella had described in her diary . Had she , in spite of that grave in the Garlaig churchyard , remained alive these past thirty-five years , the prisoner of her crazy stepfather ? But no . Not even thirty-five years ago could that pitiable creature on the floor have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who at twenty-one had been scarcely more than a girl herself . This woman looked to be at least Murdock 's age . I went into the room , set the lantern down , and knelt beside her on the straw . I took off my other mitten and  | with shaking , clumsy fingers felt under the matted hair and found the screw that held the gag in place . I unscrewed it and , as carefully as I could , removed the cruel contraption . The part that went over the tongue , I saw now , consisted of a leather strap . With a shudder , I dropped the gag onto the straw . As I did so , I noticed the iron cuff encircling the slender left ankle beneath the tattered hem of her woolen dress . From the cuff a chain ran to a ringbolt in the wall . Her hands , too , were loosely manacled , their iron cuffs joined by a chain about two feet long . She opened her mouth , trying to speak , and I saw the calloused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my face and then to her own . I sat motionless with shock , my gaze going over the features which , I realized now , had been aged far , far beyond their actual years . The eyes , red-rimmed and swollen , but still blue , still wide-spaced . The straight nose . The chin with the scarlike cleft which once must have been a dimple . The small mole at one corner of the pale , withered mouth . I said , my heart filled with horror and pity , " Arabella ? " " Who  --  ah  --  ah ? " Her tongue could not manage the " r " sound , but I understood . " I am your grand-niece , Elizabeth Logan . " She did not seem to hear , much less understand that . She continued to gaze at me with wonder . To her , deprived of a mirror for perhaps decades , it must seem that her ghostly twin had materialized beside her . Deprived . I looked around this room , in which she had lived deprived of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rounded walls , with rolled-up carpets and boxes still piled atop them . In which of those chests , I wondered , had Murdock hidden his prisoner the day that Donald , over the old man 's violent protests , had brought me to the tower ? He also had hidden her pallet and blankets , now spread out a few feet away , and the wooden bowl , still half filled with gruel , close beside her on the floor .  | He must have been feeding her tonight with that wooden spoon lying there on the straw when I hammered on the tower door . She had let out that one hoarse cry before he had slipped the gag back into place . She must have struggled , distracting his attention enough so that she was able to dip her palm into the gruel and leave its imprint on his back . My sickened gaze continued to roam the room . I saw something else that I had not seen the day I came here with Donald  --  that tattered leather screen near one of the chests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other utensil provided for her necessities . The chain fastened to her ankle , although not long enough for her to reach an arrow slit and show her face there , was sufficiently long for her to reach the screen , that one concession to her humanity . The full horror smote me then . Arabella , who had roamed the moors with the same joy that I had . Arabella , with her quick mind , and her love of poetry , and her passionate , unruly heart . For more than four years , ever since I had first read her diary , I had mourned the thought of all that beauty and sensitive intelligence going to its death in the loch . Now I wished that it had . I turned back to the woman I knew was in her middle fifties , even though she appeared to be eighty . I inspected  | the irons on her wrists and her ankle . There were no locks . They would have to be struck from her . I said , " You are going to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from here . Murdock 's pony is tethered by a locked chain . And it is very , very cold tonight . If I try to walk to the castle for help , I will freeze to death . Do you understand ? " She nodded . The joy in her eyes made them look younger . " Murdock ? Dead ? " Even though her tongue distorted the words , I understood them . " No . But he is injured , and he is bound hand and foot . He can not harm us . " I paused . " Who did this to you ? Your husband ? " The Arabella of the diary was still alive somewhere within her . Hate leaped into her eyes . She nodded . " How long have you been here ? How many years ? " She hesitated , and then held up six fingers . Six years . I imagined her measuring them by the changing angles of the sun 's first rays through the arrow slits , and by the alternation of winter cold with the comparative warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " When I found her reply unintelligible , I asked , " Somewhere on Clarence MacElvin 's lands ? " She nodded . Perhaps he had kept her , gagged and chained , in some remote part of the manor house , her presence known only to himself or to some servant bound to him through money , or shared guilt , or both . Perhaps he had kept her in some separate building . Wherever her prison had been , I thought grimly , soon all Scotland would know about it . But one thing was clear . Six years ago he had brought  | her here . Why ? What had happened six years ago ? Of course . Six years ago Clarence had taken unto himself , bigamously , a wife who possessed not only rich prospects but a cool intelligence . Arabella 's presence , no matter how well hidden , had become too dangerous to him . And so , perhaps under cover of a long winter night , he had installed her here with the mute old falcon keeper as her jailer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to you ? " Again that flash of hatred . " Treason , " she said , almost distinctly . " He was a traitor ? " She nodded . " To the Hanoverians ? " Again she nodded . " Took  --  French gold . " French gold . It was in large part French gold which had financed that Stuart Rising thirty-five years ago , in 1715 . Clarence MacElvin , that seeming staunch supporter of the Protestant succession , had taken King Louis 's money . And in return for it ? In return he must have given a secret pledge to support with his arms and those of his tenants the exiled Catholic Stuarts . But when the Rising actually came , he had not kept his promise , probably because of a belated realization that the rebellion was bound to fail . He had remained in the eyes of everyone a staunch supporter of the Protestant monarchy until  --  months after the 1715 Rising had been crushed  --  an agent of the French had appeared to remind him of that broken promise . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young bride who hated him had learned of the treason that could cost him his head . Even now , I realized , it could cost him his head . Only  | three years before a certain Lord Derwentwater had been beheaded , not for any part in the 1745 Rising led by Charles Edward , but in the 1715 Rising led by Charles 's father . Sitting here now beside the broken creature my greataunt had become , I realized that all along I should have guessed the nature of what she had discovered . In her much-underlined copy of King Richard the Third , in a scene dealing with another indecisive turncoat named Clarence , she had made a double line beneath the words " false , fleeting , perjured Clarence . " I could imagine how , after listening to that conversation between her husband and the French agent , she had gone up to her room , made that last entry in her diary , and then with bitter triumph  --  remembering the swift if informal execution of that other Clarence  --  opened her copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Whether or not Clarence MacElvin had been forced to return the French gold might never be known at this late date . Probably he had , with interest . But there was little doubt what had happened to Arabella . Late in the afternoon the day after she wrote that last entry in her diary , she had gone for a walk on the moors and never returned . Was it her husband alone who had seized her and carried her off to some place of imprisonment , or had he been aided by the comparatively young Murdock of thirty-five years before ? Probably the latter , I decided , and probably Murdock had kept her for a few weeks here in the tower , while Clarence MacElvin went off to London to show himself prominently in public places . He had still been in London when , about two weeks after Arabella 's disappearance , the body of a yellow-haired young woman had
