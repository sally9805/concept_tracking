It was the first time in his twelve years as Labor Party leader that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson delivered a speech to the party faithful without receiving a standing ovation . The inauspicious occasion was a recent one-day special conference of the Labor Party ; the divisive issue was how Labor should vote in the June 5 referendum on Britain 's continued participation in the European Common Market . Unimpressed by Wilson 's tepid pro-Market address , the 962 delegates ( representing some 6 million members of the labor movement ) responded by voting almost 2 to 1 for British withdrawal from the EEC . <P> The conference 's rebuff to Wilson was unprecedented but hardly unexpected . During the past month , virtually every institutional body of the labor movement has firmly opposed Wilson on this issue . The powerful Trades Union Congress , the party 's National Executive Committee , 145 of Labor 's 318 M.P.s and almost a third of the Labor Cabinet have publicly broken ranks with their leader . The split over the EEC coincides with an increasingly bitter party battle over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally placed party unity above all , is now presiding over what may prove to be the worst Labor crisis since World War II . Some pro-EEC Labor ministers , notably Home Secretary Roy Jenkins and Consumer Affairs Minister Shirley Wilson , have threatened to resign if the vote should go against the Common Market . <P> Every Mailbox . The anti-Marketeers argue that EEC membership will lead to more unemployment , higher food prices and less sovereignty for Britain . Pro-Marketeers maintain that membership will reduce unemployment , lower food prices and bolster Britain 's world influence . The official referendum campaign pamphlets-which are being delivered at government expense to every mailbox in the land this week-do little to clarify matters . With more drama than cogency , the Why You Should Vote Yes pamphlet argues that " outside the EEC we should be alone in a harsh , cold world with none of our friends offering to revive old partnerships . " <P> The pro-Market appeal seems like hardheaded analysis , however , compared with the unabashed Little England jingoism of the Why You Should Vote No brief : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , to become one single country in which Britain would be reduced to a mere province ... This may be acceptable to some Continental countries . In recent times , they have been ruled by dictators , or defeated or occupied . They are more used to abandoning their political institutions than we are . " <P> The campaign to present the EEC as a threat to British sovereignty is being spearheaded by left-wing labor leaders and their staunchest supporters within Wilson 's Cabinet , Employment Minister Michael Foot , Trade Minister Peter Shore and Industry Minister Anthony Wedgwood Benn . Some political observers argue that Wilson 's left-wing opponents are using the Common Market referendum to challenge his control of the Labor Party for reasons only tangentially connected to the EEC . The politically ambitious Benn , whose campaign to advance public ownership of British industry has made him anathema to the party 's right wing , seems particularly intent on driving a wedge between the Prime Minister and Britain 's restive labor unions .               @ @ @ @ @ @
