Jonathan Armitage , the state 's attorney , had also been given an assistant , Oscar Achilles Dilk , a black-haired , bullet-headed young man with a mind like a bear trap and a jaw the shape of a Shawnee 's battle-axe . Dilk was obviously headed for the Senate . And barring slip-ups , the Presidency itself might be just around the corner . The Indian agent , Colonel Johnston , would be present during the entire trial . He would see that witnesses showed up when needed and that their fees were paid . He had also been instructed to have Indian chiefs and lesser chiefs , the Mingos , present when possible to observe the trial and send the news back to the tribes : " White men are being tried for murder for killing Indians .

She had ignored the general ; ignored Patrick Conroy , originally , like herself , from the old sod ; given Noah Beazley , the very picture of a dark and handsome city lawyer , the go-by . She had offered the room to Charlie because , she told him , " You look like my late son . " Charlie was accustomed to having lonesome widows tell him that he reminded them of their late husbands . Reminding a widow of her late son was more to his liking . He moved into the widow 's loft room at once , without wasting time or pity on his fellow lawyers .

" Charles Fort , " he had been told , " you 're an oddity . " Not a mud-fence , ugly oddity . Kisses had told him that . But no one else 's spit and image , for sure . He was dish-faced , with a head of fine black hair that a brisk wind parted to show a blue-white scalp .

The looking glass did n't show him belowthe Adam 's apple , but he knew what was there : a body wideshouldered , spare in the short ribs and waist , and supported by thighs heavy and meaty , like his neck . " I 'm no Adonis , " Charlie admitted to himself . But who needed looks when he had luck ? He got good horses at livery stables , helpings from the first serving at boardinghouses , and whiskey from the bottle hidden behind the front row of bottles at taverns .

Leverett had sent him east to Harvard , where the bright Yankee boys went , planning for him to take over the Leverett newspaper , the Western Spy , when he graduated . In spite of himself , Charlie turned out to be a lawyer . A newspaper writer has to tome things down ; Charlie had watched Leverett do this for years . A lawyer could tear the rag off the bush , could tell the jury facts that would lose an editor every subscriber he had . Charlie 's mouth was n't gentled enough for newspaper work .

He knew the Western Spy was n't interested in how Charlie Fortp78was making out amongst the woodsies and redskins . He did n't begin his writing with " Dear Pa . " That would lead him into a request for new shaving soap and an account of a redheaded girl he had seen who had made him want to follow her into the green gloom of the unending stands of trees the way men run after fox fire in a swamp .

Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : Pendleton is a town of two hundred souls . I made the mistake when I first arrived here of calling Pendleton a settlement . The Pendletonianswasted no time setting me right on that score . A settlement is a place like Fall Creek , twenty miles upriver  --  no stores , streets , or taverns there . Pendleton is a town . My idea of a town naturally is Cincinnati . Two theaters , three thousand books in our library , board walks , street lights . I doubt if half a dozen books could be scared up in this entire settlement . Excuse me , I mean town . Excluding , of course , the Good Book . They own that , even if they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On my first day here I was told that I was expected at midday to take dinner with Judge Giddings . Three judges sit here : a presiding judge appointed by the state legislature , and two elected associate judges who are local . The presiding judge is Amos McGowan . Giddings , a man much respected here , is one of the associate judges , as is Omer Oursley , the town blacksmith . Oursley ironed the prisoners after they all climbed over the walls of the prison stockade on the first night of their incarceration . Nobody here , including the prisoners , takes this trial very seriously . They look at it as a kind of playpartytableau to impress the Indians . Wait until that Indian agent Johnston gets through with them . He intends another kind of party . Oursley appears to be a good man with hammer and tongs , but he ca n't read or write . Ezra Fenton , the clerk of the court , can , they say , write his own name . He is a justice of the peace and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sued on every section of the statute and know all about the law , while the man running against me has never been sued for anything whatsoever and knows nothing about the stat/ute . " This made sense to the citizens of this town and they elected him . Knowledge is knowledge no matter how you come by it , they figure . Samuel Brady , the sheriff , in buckskins , moccasins , and with a side knife the size of a pigsticker , is a sight to scare wrongdoers without ever hearing the sound of his voice ; a sound they say can be heard as far north as the Lakes and as far south as the falls of the Ohio . Brady , being bigger than most men , would be an awesome sight in his underdrawers without the knife . He is actually no different from the rest of the men here in what he wears , in the size of his side knife or his lack of shoes . Every man , woman , and child here is in moccasins . I have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me as I go clip-clopping along in my brogans as if I was half horse , and had been shod by Oursley himself . I am here , however , to report the trial to you , not to take up your time describing a way of life we outgrew some years ago . But the truth is , I do n't feel much different here on Fall Creek than I would on the banks of the Congo . As Pendleton now is , we once were . But as a grown man forgets the time he crawled and hung to his mother 's skirts , so we in the civilized city of Cincinnati forget how we lived when the town was first settled . Infancy , judging by Pendleton , is a state to outgrow as fast as possible . Judge Giddings invited me to dinner ; it was not an invitation to be turned down lightly . It was n't issued out of any concern for my comfort , but because it is felt to be a duty of visiting lawyers and the like  --  if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something lighter than murder , Indian abduction , ague , and death by snakebite . Play party or not , trials here are attended by as many as three hundred people . Lately , I am told , a lawyer from out of state asked permission of the presiding judge in a polite but somewhat lengthy way to " plead his case . " " Plead , plead , " the judge ordered him testily . " For what other reasondo you think three hundred people have gathered here except to hear you lawyers orate ? Get on with it . " The rebuked lawyer did , for three hours , and the woodsies listened to him spiel the way we would have listened to Patrick Henry declaim . I was glad to find that I was n't going to have to carry the burden of entertaining Judge Giddings alone . Also present for dinner were Jonathan Armitage , the circuit prosecutor , and a friend of his , Dan McGowan , brother of the presiding judge . Giddings , after Armitagep80had declined , asked the blessing . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was well stuffed , as we discovered , with a dressing of tasty bread and onions . Dan McGowan , after his first bite , said by way of compliment , " Judge , this is a damned fine goose . " Giddings , to my astonishment , replied , " Yes , it is a fine goose and you are fined a dollar for swearing . " It seems that in the town of Pendleton there is a statute imposing a fine of one dollar on any person who should " profanely curse , swear , or damn . " My God , I 'm glad I did n't open my mouth about that goose , which was damned fine . After McGowan 's profanity and Giddings 's fine , not another word was said during the entire meal . Armitage and his friend McGowan could scarcely swallow for rage . The judge and I chomped away withoutinterruption . When we finally pushed back our chairs , the judge said , " Squire McGowan , pay me a dollar . " I was beginning to get some idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plead my case before . Invite a man to dinner and fine him a dollar for complimenting your goose ! Squire McGowan , from Indianapolis , no mean town itself , to hear him tell it , said , " I have n't a cent with me , Judge . " " Perhaps your friend Armitage will loan it to you , " Giddings said , accepting no excuse . Armitage said , " I have barely enough to pay my tavern bill , Judge . " I had the money but I thought , It is n't my goose that 's being cooked . Let these Hoosier friends and lawyers fight it out among themselves . Judge Giddings asked , " What 's to be done ? " " Loan him the money , Judge , and take his note . Or bind him over to court , " suggested Armitage . " If I bind him over , will you go his security ? " " The law forbids lawyers going security for anyone , Judge . But you can go security yourself , " Armitage reminded Giddings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Giddings appeared before Henry Giddings , Associate Judge of the Madison Circuit Court , and acknowledged themselves indebted to the state in the penalty of twenty-five dollars each , for the appearance of Daniel McGowan at the next term of court , to answer . " Now I 'll be damned , fine me or not , if this preposterous idea wasn'tp81accepted . The paper was drawn up and signed . Thus ended my first dinner party in the town of Pendleton . I left thanking Judge Giddings for his goose , which I was careful to call " tasty " ; though in truth , as McGowan had said earlier , it was damned fine . After the dinner I went over to talk with my clients , whom I had n't yet seen . This town had had no jail and no courthouse until what they have been calling " the massacre " took place . The citizens here are accustomed to throwing up buildings on short order out of necessity . They arrive , bag and baggage , with no roof over their heads until they raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not fancy . This jail , though more substantial , is about on the order of what a Buckeye would call a farrowing pen . It is square , built of heavy beech and sugar-tree logs notched down carefully and fitting tight above , below , and on the sides . The place has one door and no window . Until the escape of all the prisoners soon after they were brought over from the settlement , there was no stockade . Now a stockade manned by guards day and night surrounds the prison . The guards are paid by the Indian Bureau and have a daily ration of meal for corn pone and liquid corn for drinking . I was let into the stockade and through it into the jail room itself . It is , as I said , no better than a shed for animals . No furniture , straw on the floor ; a bucket in a corner for an outhouse . The men themselves , though heavily ironed and in such disagreeable surroundings , were in good spirits . Old Wood , sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading a novel , obtained God knows where . The guards let them crack the door enough to get a sliver of light for reading . No one , ironed as these men were , was going anyplace if the door was wide open . But the nonreaders objected to an opening wide enough to let the wind whistle in . I introduced myself as one of the lawyers come to defend them . They were not at all happy to see me . They were not much fazed by being accused of murder . Mad , yes , that their neighbors , gone chickenhearted about the possibility of Indian revenge , had helped round them up and bring them to jail . But not fazed . They were more taken aback because the very Indian Bureau they all hated took these charges seriously enough to provide them with defenders like myself . Anybody can be accused of anything . But to have the Indian Bureau take these accusations seriously enough to provide defense lawyers galled them inordinately . Benson , clanking like a gristmill , strode about bellowing at me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " What 's this country come to ? Lock a man up for shooting a redskin ? Where would we all be if our fathers and grandfathers had been too thin-skinned to do that ? Bones , is what . Skulls without hair . Or driven back into the sea . There would n't be a white man alive in the U.S.A. today if we had n't fought them red devils . My father and your father was praised for what I done . And now you lock me up . Iron me like a mad bull . " I tried to calm him down , or at least to quiet him down . " Mr. Benson , I did n't lock you up . I 'm not disagreeing with a word you say . I 'm here to get you out of here just as soon as possible . There 'll likely have to be a trial . Colonel Johnston and Secretary Calhoun have promised the Indians that if they hold off from attacking the settlers , the men who were responsible for the massacre  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they 'd killed white men . " " If I 'd killed a white man , I 'd expect to be more than tried  --  I 'd expect to be strung up . " " There have been white men killed  --  justifiably . That 's one reason I 'm here . Undoubtedly there was some reason , some reason a jury will understand , for your shooting those Indians . " " The jury will understand why I did it . Just one word from you . " " And that word ? " " Indians . And the Indian Bureau did n't need to go all the way to Ohio to find a man to say it . " " Those tribes up north are n't going to swallow setting you free for a reason like that . They 're all Indians , too , and they 're clean against shooting a man because he 's an Indian . Now if there was some act of aggression . . . " " What d' you mean , act of aggression ' ? " " If they shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to . If they stole your horse . Or made a run at you . Or taunted you . Or threatened you . Did anything like this precipitate the shooting ? " " Hell , no . They were a bunch of squaws and their brats . How could they threaten ? Except breeding the way they do . " " So there was no reason for the shooting ? " Benson , in spite of the load of metal he was wearing , jumped afoot in the air and came down in the straw , raising a cloud of dust . " There was reason . How many times do I have to tell you ? Areyou deaf ? They were Indians . They were fishing in our streams ; trappingeverything with fur . Killing off the deer . Bleeding the mapletrees . Pushing in right next to our homes . Asking our women forhandouts . How 'd those Indians up north like it if we started doingp83that ? These are facts . And every man you can set on a jury knows it . The Indian Bureau taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up to Madison County and tell us what we already know . " George Benson was about like a boy who 's picked windfalls in his neighbor 's orchard all his life . . . . No , that 's a bad example . He was like a man who 's shot wolves all his life in the belief that he 's protecting himself and his neighbors and who 's suddenly told wolves must be protected  --  young and old , male and female  --  unless by chance the wolf has got his fangs at your throat . That 's the way he 'd been brought up and lived ; and that 's the way his father and grandfather had lived . And nothing Calhoun or Colonel Johnston could say was going to change him . Not overnight , anyway . I decided there was no use wasting more breath at this point on Benson . Wood Sr. was deep in a nest of straw , as comfortable as a setting hen . He was n't shaped anything like a hen , thin and brittle as a cornstalk after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white of an old Plymouth Rock . He closed his Bible on his finger when I approached and said , " Sorry I ca n't ask you to pull up a chair . " He was the opposite of Benson : calm , understanding , and seeminglynot too put out to be sitting in a straw nest in a jailhouse . " We 'll spend a week or two here ' tit the whole thing blows over . After the bumings up north , I guess our neighbors did n't have much choice . In their shoes I 'd of done the same thing , likely . Better for us to have a little spell of setting here than for them heathen to sweep down on our women and children . " " There 's going to be a trial , " I told him . " That 's why I 'm here . " " I never been in a trial , but I 've seen more'n one and I 'll know how to handle myself . You 're the one appointed to get us off , ai n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll find me an apt pupil . I ai n't as young as I was , but I 've got all my wits about me still . " The boy reading the novel said something like , " Hrrumph . " " That 's my son , " the old man said . " John Wood , Jr . He thinks I lost my wits marrying again . " " Nothing wrong with marrying . It 's who you marry , " said the son . " Reba 's my problem , not yours . " " Well , there 's one thing she ca n't say about me any more . " " That 's a fact , and she knows it . Benson here says he could n't have done better himself at the camp . And he told her so . " I was n't interested in the home affairs of the Wood family.  | " I heard down at the tavern that others besides you three ought to be here , " I told Wood . " Clasby , you mean ? He 's clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the leader in this ? " " What d' you mean , leader ' ? " Benson , who had clanked over , asked . " Did he put you up to it ? " " What do you mean , put us up to it ' ? We been fighting Indians all of our lives . We would n't be alive today if we had n't . We 're grown men , Counselor , we do n't need anybody to put us up to anything . " Benson gave me strong thoughts about applying for a job with the prosecutor . If I had n't already been feed to save his neck , the sight of Benson twitching at the end of a rope would n't give me too much pain . I ignored Benson . " Mr. Wood , I heard clown at the tavern that besides Clasby there was another man at the shooting . Is that right ? " Wood Sr. did n't get a chance to answer . " If anybody else was there , let Calhoun and Johnston ferret them out , " Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like wild animals . Ai n't that enough to satisfy the redskins and their guardian angels , the Indian Bureau ? " " I am hired by the Indian Bureau to defend you . I did n't ferret you out or chain you . " " I ai n't done anything to be defended for . " " There was one other there , " old Mr. Wood said . " A boy . And he did n't have a gun or take any part in it . " " He sure as hell did n't . For all the help he gave us , he could 've been a redskin himself , " Benson declared . " Who was this boy ? " " Ben Cape . The preacher 's son , " Benson replied . " Nothing but a soft pile of guts . Never saw a preacher 's son who was n't either a hellion or a soft pile of guts . Do n't know why , but a preacher 's son . . . " Wood Jr . said , " Shh , " and Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , said , " Well , speak of the devil ! " Not the most courteous way to address your pastor , but Cale Cape , as Benson called him , had lived too long among these rough Indian killers to take offense . " Well , George , " said he , " your body may be in chains but your spirit , I see , is still free and soaring . " Caleb Cape had left Piqua before I passed through there , but Ip85had heard about his ride to bring the news of the killings to Colonel Johnston . He must have known this would n't endear him to the killers  --  but there were more people to think about at the settlement than the killers . And in case of a raid from the north , none of the braves from up there was going to inquire as to who had done the bloody work at the sugar camp in order to spare them . If anything , Benson and the two Woods would be spared for special attention after the quick work was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cape . Besides , the Indian Black Antler had been the one to get the news to Colonel Johnston while Cape was laid up someplace with the grippe . Cape does n't look much like our Ohio preachers , plumped up on chicken and dumplings and with a paunch to put a pretty curve on a watch chain . Cape is a tall , lean man . I can see some Godsearchingin his eyes , but there 's a sardonic turn to his mouth that looks more like punning than praying to me . Be that as it may , he said , " Mr. Fort , I understand . These men are members of my church . This is the Sabbath and they 've been denied religious service . I 've come over to read the Gospel and pray with them . You 're welcome to stay if you 've missed divine worship today yourself . Welcome , in any case . " I thanked him and said he 'd likely prefer to be alone with his parishioners . What he preferred , I did n't care , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to be absent when he started praying and testifying . " My daughter 's waiting outside . The guards did n't think the jail a place for a young girl . You might keep her company for a while . " He was right . The jail was n't any place for her . Cape 's daughter was the girl I had caught sight of earlier , the fox-fire girl . The place for her was out in the open , with plenty of cooling air for all . I said who I was and she said who she was . " Hannah Cape . " What a name for a girl who flares up like a pine-knot torch on a dark night . HannahCape ! Some slipshod backwoods slattern , from the name ; and here she was fresh from Parnassus , neither backwoods nor frontwoods , but from that peak where gods and goddesses live .

( If I succeed in winning the case , I may be . ) The subscribers to the Western Spy do n't give a tinker 's dam whether Charlie Fort has or has not fallen in love .

So with that warning : this girl , Hannah Cape . A lot of these backwoodsgirls are so bashful they throw their aprons over their faces when a strange man puts in an appearance . Not Hannah . She stood there ready to give me as good as she got . If I wanted to stare , she would stare back . It was a raw March day , darker and gloomier down here because of the woods .

The service for worship had n't been very worshipful . If God had listened to that morning 's praying , His head must be spinning . He had been asked to release the imprisoned ; to restrain the Indian Bureau , punish the redskins for their killing and burning up north ; to send Clasby back to make a full confession that the guilt was his alone ; to bless Colonel Johnston in his efforts to appease the heathen ; to protect them from attack ; to have Colonel Johnston scalped ; and the praying was divided about half and half to have Caleb Cape himself either blessed or shut up , once and for all .

But apart from discomfort for the men and Sarah Benson 's real misery , separated Mom her husband , there was something more terrible : loss of face . How could white men ever hold up their heads again , after being clapped into jail for killing an Indian ? Instead of quieting the Indians down , would n't this embolden them ? Lizzie did n't know .

I hope I did n't scare you . Ben said to come on in . " " No . I was only dozing . Come in and shut the door . Warm yourself , " she said . Bemis was rubbing his hands , and he had his jacket collar turned up like a man bone-cold . " The wind 's raw . " " I reckon you 're not still suffering from your sickness . " " The only sickness I had , Lizzie , was heartsickness . " " We all get that at times , Lute . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not like mine . " " I did n't say that . " Bemis pulled his bench right up to the edge of the ashes and used the fire 's warmth like water to lave his hands , turning them over and over like a hired man at the washbasin after the dinner bell 's rung . She and Lute were at home with each other . It was strange that it should be so . He , a long hunter , a wanderer , had had more than one Indian wife , it was said , and a knife that had spilled much blood , human as well as animal . They were about of an age , and she could n't tell herself she felt motherly toward Lute . Or sisterly , either . She felt like a woman in the presence of a pleasing man . Perhaps most women felt that way with Luther Bemis . She was easy in her feeling about him because the bond with Caleb was so strong . Caleb was her husbandthe way her mother was her mother , a flesh-and-blood tie nothingcould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neverp90imagine being a mother of hers , so there were men she could never imagine as a husband . Lute was n't one of these . They were one flesh the way the Bible said . Nothing she felt about Lute would change or would need to be hidden if Caleb came in . Caleb had converted Luther Bemis , made a Christian out of a hard-drinking , loose-living wanderer ; seen him settled and married , felling trees and planting corn ; expecting now a young one born of a Christian marriage . She was no minister of the gospel , but she was Caleb 's right hand in his work  --  he himself said so  --  and in this way they were both Luther Bemis 's spiritual parents . " I came looking for Cale . He around someplace ? " " I hope so . But he 's not around here . He and Hannah rode over to Pendleton to see the men in jail there . " " They 're still holding them ? " " There 's going to be a trial . You surely know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their senses . " " They ? " " The government . " " It makes sense to the government to try the men who did the killing , if that 'll stave off an Indian uprising . Do n't it to you ? " " They 're our own folks , Lizzie . " " The ones the Indians 'd scalp would be our own folks . Us , maybe . " " Sometime last week the world went round a bend , Lizzie . Whatwas is past and out of sight . What 's to come 's too far ahead to see . " " Went round a bend ? What happened last week ? " " Lizzie , women are the most matter-of-fact beings in creation . Nothing happened last week except that we suddenly caught sight of what 's around a corner we 'd never turned before . " " What was that sight ? " " A world where an Indian is a human being who ca n't be killed like a bear or a wolf . " " What 's that mean for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness ahead . " It was full dark when Lizzie heard the horses come into the yard . Ben went out to unsaddle and feed . Both Caleb and Hannah were wet with the drizzle that had started up after Bemis left . Lizzie could feel the tiredness in Caleb as she helped him out of his coat . Hannahwas as lit up as if she 'd made the whole trip on wings under angel-kindled starlight . She was even less wet than Caleb . Lizzie let Hannah take care of herself . She pulled her own rocker to the firep91for Caleb and brought him a cup of hot sassafras tea and a slice of sweet cake . She did n't intend to lay the burden of Luther Bemis 's need on his shoulders until he was , if not rested , at least dry and fed . " How are they ? " she asked . She did n't need to say who . " They 're dry , " Caleb said . " That 's more than I can say for myself . " " How 're they taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as any place . Both reading . Benson may tear the place down . " " Ai n't he ironed ? " " I 've seen a bull with a ring in his nose bust through a fence even though he lost a part of his nose in the process . Benson 's bull-mad . " " They 're not in any danger , are they ? " " They do n't think they are . " " What do you think ? " " I think the government means business . " " Business ? " " Try them . And if guilty , hang them . " " Treat Indians like whites ? " " They ought to , I reckon . At long last . But I would n't stake my life on its happening . Lizzie , could I have a little hot milk with some rum in it ? " " I 'll fix it for you , Papa , " Hannah said . She swooped to put milk in a saucepan , saucepan next the coals , rum in the milk . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She do n't know she rode . There was a young defense lawyer over there too busy making eyes at her to pay much heed to his clients . " " Better the lawyer than that poor accused boy . " " Nothing 's been proved yet about him . All 's hearsay so far . " " I did n't say guilty . " " Lizzie , you 'd make a fine lawyer . " After Caleb drank his hot milk and rum , Lizzie told him about Bemis 's visit . " I told Lute you 'd be played out . " " I am . But I 'll have to go . Ora needs someone to talk to . " " You know what 's the trouble ? " " I 've got an inkling . " Charlie Fort was always able to start his Ohio letters with real news of the impending and unheard-of trial : whites being tried for killing Indians . His concluding paragraphs were about himself andp92Hannah . He tried , in the real-news part of his letters , not to editorialize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist so near a center of learning like Cincinnati . He did permit a little of his amazement to show . Otherwise his fellow citizens of the Queen City would find his reports unbelievable . Extracts from letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : The town of Pendleton ( I 've learned finally not to call it a settlement ) had first of all to build itself a jail to hold the only prisoners it has ever impounded . It has now also built itself a courthouse in which to try these prisoners . It is , I suppose , a courthouse ; but there is nothing to distinguish it from a livery stable or a low-class tavern in our parts . It is a log building with two rooms , one for the court , one for the grand jury . The courtroom is about twenty by thirty feet long with a heavy puncheon floor and a platform about three feet high at one end enclosed by a heavy railing . Inside this railing is a bench for the judges ; a deal table and chair for the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace by his claim that he knew all about the law , having been " sued on every section of the statute . " In front of the platform is a long bench for counsel . Here I will sit . Near this bench is a little pen for the prisoners I 'll be defending . There is a side bench for witnesses just behind counsel . A long strong pole , substantially supported and attached to the floor , serves as a railing which it is hoped will separate the court and bar from the crowd that will be attending this trial . Feeling , as I need not say , is running very high here . Half the populaceis so fearful of retaliatory vengeance by the tribes , and especiallyby the always warlike Seneca , that they would , I verily believe , roast every prisoner alive to calm down the Indians and save their own hides . The other half of the populace are friends and relatives of the prisonersand those who believe that trying whites for killing Indians will be taken by the red men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon us the worst massacres we have yet experienced at their hands . Persons of these convictions would like to free the prisoners , and , though outnumbered , are prepared to fight off any reprisals , shot for shot . But the government is standing firm in its determination to hold this trial . Colonel Johnston will be back with Indian chiefs andMingos to let the people of Madison County understand what will  |p93surely  happen if there is not a legal trial with due justice to follow . Johnston has been empowered to fee witnesses and to require their presence at the trial . And the very employment of General James Noble , a United States senator , to prosecute the men accused of the killing will convince the Indians that the Great White Father is on their side . We defense lawyers will have our work cut out for us , as I am fully aware . There are some few , a handful at most , who regard this trial in the light of any other trial , and disregard color . Men have killed men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , prevail . Caleb Cape is no doubt one of these . Black Antler , the Seneca Indian prophet , goes even further . But I do n't expect him to have a hearing . He does n't want any executions . At the time of my first visit to my clients , recounted earlier , I met Caleb Cape , the preacher at the settlement where the prisoners live . Cape is not a preacher by virtue of any ordination , nor does he professto be of any particular denomination . He is a preacher by virtue of the fact that he preaches . He does preach with power , and the settlement could n't hold him in higher regard if he had arrived anointed by archbishops , wearing robes , and bearing certificates and seals . At the time I met Cape ( since he is n't ordained I wo n't call him Reverend ) , I also met his daughter , Hannah ; and I heard from my clients , Benson and the two Woods , that her brother , age fourteen , had been at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all said he had taken no part in it . I met Caleb Cape on Sunday at the jail . Three days later , on Wednesday , I rode over to his place . I did n't expect too much trouble defending my clients ; they were white men protecting themselves against the nuisance , if not the menace , of having Indians move in on them , fish their streams , kill their game , and scare their women . But if the Cape boy could report some threatening word or gesture , my case would be further strengthened . Seeing Hannah again did n't go against my grain , either ; that low voice that could be mistaken for a boy 's if you had n't seen the throat and bosom from whence it rose , that hair strong as sunlight . Though to tell the truth , so overwhelming was my feeling for this girl seen for an hour at the most that I had been blinded to remembrance of her features . I could remember her voice clearly enough . And no one could forget that bonfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , brow ? Feeling had covered my eyes like a film . Here I was broodingp94about a girl I was n't sure I 'd recognize in a crowd if she had her hair covered . I was homesick for her . But how can a man be homesickfor a land he ca n't remember ? So I wanted to go over and find out what I was homesick for . Perhaps be lucky and lose my homesickness , for , as it was , I was not much use to myself or to my case with my heart in a knot of ignorance and aching for knowledge . In any case , Hannah or no Hannah , it was my duty to see and talk to Ben Cape , so I had no trouble persuading myself to saddle Bay Boy at sunup Wednesday morning . My little pacer , eager as I was to cover ground , stepped off the near to twenty miles in something less than three hours . It is now full spring . Not that this far north there wo n't be sleet , snow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even in May there is always the chance of a blackberry winter , white snowflakesbigger than the white blossoms of the vines they settle on . But April was just around the corner . I smelled it all the way riding to Hannah ; smelled the dogwood , redbud , and elder blossoms in the season ahead of me . All came floating rich and fragrant on a tide of warm wind and of water freshened with the melting of winter 's snow . In this back country , anyone who steps out of his house is visible  --  unless he 's gone behind a tree to dodge arrows or to relieve himself . There are no hedges , fences , not even a little low picket fence ; no rows of trees , no lilac or snowball bushes . There 's not even the clutter of rigs and farm implements that sometimes fills our farmyards at home . If you were of a mind to keep track of it , you could cast up an account of the number of trips made by a family to the outhouse each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ( men here in the back country think privies sissified , and take to the bushes themselves ) . Keeping an eye on women on such errands would n't set well with them or their menfolks , and I do n't intend to attempt it . The point is , except for the trees , it 's a wide-open country , and what is n't done inside four walls or behind a tree can be seen as far as your eyes are good for . These woodsies have houses or cabins , but these cabins are not suited for a lot of the work that has to be done . You ca n't butcher inside , or tan a hide , or boil down maple sap , or pluck a goose , or smoke a ham , or make soap inside where you 're sleeping and eating . I mention soap because that was what I saw Hannah making that spring day on Wednesday . The winter 's ashes had been leached out , and she was mixing the lye in a big twenty-gallon iron pot with thep95grease  --  hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make soft soap . I 'd as soon try to find a girl Hannah 's age in Cincinnati who could raise a barn as make a bar of usable soap nowadays . Time was when every girl in Cincinnati had the art of soapmaking mastered . Who knows that art now , younger than mothers and grandmothers ? Pause in extracts from letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . At this point Charlie knew that he was n't going to send the rest of his letter home for publication in the Western Spy . Not the part he felt he had to write about Hannah , anyway . But he could n't stop talking about her . He was a man of words  --  every lawyer is  --  but at the minute he was less a lawyer than a would-be lover . If I were a poet , he thought , I 'd write a poem . Hannah would be a damned awkward word to work into a poem , and the words men used in poems to describe their loves  --  doves and evening stars and timid violets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove . " What nonsense . He had fallen in love with something more feral . He had no closer friend than the man who had adopted him , and his father would listen if he wanted to write pages praising Hannah . But he was n't presumptuous enough to try to pass off passion as news for the readers of the Western Spy . He had come to a fresh sheet of paper and was prepared to write on it for the pleasure it gave him , as if he were talking to his father . His father would laugh at him , say , " This is a story I seem to have heard from you before , Charlie , but the heroine is new , so spiel on . " Well , she was not only new , she was final , if he could trust his present feelings . He continued to write , though his feeling was of talking . To his father ? Maybe . Maybe to Hannah herself . Continuation of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this girl , to rid myself of the torment of trying to paint her face each night under my closed eyes . Now the minute I saw her a couple of hundred yards away , my heart gave such a jump I was half of a mind to turn Bay Boy in his tracks and head back for Pendleton . What if all my heartthrobbinghad been over a girl with a face like an Irish potato ? And would I be any better off if I saw under that hair and above that bosom the face that launched the thousand ships ? How was I going to live through that ? Hannah Cape was n't the first girl I had lookedp96at and clasped . College boys back in Cambridge are judged something of a treat by town girls there . But Hannah Cape compared with those girls was like an eel among flounders . And eel or flounder , I had my work cut out for me in Pendleton . I had n't been chosen for nothingby Johnston and Calhoun . And choice apart , for my own future and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scapegoats , I intended a defense that would n't soon be forgotten . I intended to remind that jury of every Indian raid and torture from 1700 to 1824 , omitting not one faggot of the burnings or knife of the slicings . Potato face would be the best for me . But she looked up at me from over her soft-soap mixture and I saw the launching face . Some remnants of Presbyterian upbringing and sense of duty to my clients prevented me from pulling her up onto Bay Boy and riding off with her . I think she would have gone without undue fuss . She had the launching face . She also had some boyish straightforwardnessthat made me jump down and greet her like a teammate , handshake and all . At this point I do n't know whether what I wanted most was to bed her or wrestle her for a fall . So I talked . It 's our great human protection and cover-up . Nice mess of soap , if I ever saw one , said I. Fine open weather for this early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your folks . Was her brother home ? I knew he was . I 'd seen him cut for the house as I came into the clearing . She could n't lie . " He 's at home . " " I 've come over to talk to him . " She told me truths and I told her half-truths . " He does n't want to talk to any lawyers . " " Sooner or later he 'll have to . " " How will he have to ? " " The court has the power to bring witnesses into court and to make them answer questions . " " Any questions ? " " Any pertaining to the case being tried . " " What if they wo n't ? " " They 'll go to jail ' til they change their minds . " " How can they send a boy to jail for not talking ? " " If the court orders a witness to talk and he wo n't , he shows contempt for the court . That 's punishable under the law . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My clients say so . " " Benson and the Wood men ? "  | " Yes . " " Ben will never talk . " " Nobody accuses him of having a hand in what happened . " " Why do you want him to talk ? Do you think he can tell you something that will make things easier for Benson and Johnny and his father ? " " I hoped he might . " " He ca n't . I know all he knows . You 're better off never to say a word to him . " " How do you know all he knows ? You were n't there , were you ? " " Of course not . But he 's told me . " " You could tell me . Just the parts you think he would n't mind my hearing . " " I wo n't tell you anything . I do n't even like to stand here where he can see us talking about him . " " Let 's walk down to the branch . Can you leave your soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " " I use a lot . " She did n't laugh . But she did start to walk downhill toward the branch that circles the knoll the Cape house is built on . We walked in step , not touching . Arm in arm with some girls , you ca n't keep step . They mince , prance , lurch , and , willing as you are to match mince , prance , and lurch , there 's no match possible . You 're as mismatchedas a pacer hitched to a trotter . Hannah and I advanced step for step , right foot with right foot , left with left , not touching , except hip or shoulder occasionally , lightly , as if we were n't both big-boned and well fleshed , but some species of winged insect . When we got to the branch we naturally stopped . Wading was n't on the program . Soap was a finished subject . She refused to get started on brother Ben . What country people call frog spit was shimmeringalong on the surface of the branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was dazzling . I 've never seen an emerald , but the glitter was like jewels . There was nothing to say . I did n't ask . She did n't offer . When we kissed we were up off the ground for a while . I was , anyway . We rose to that meeting like creatures of air . End of extracts from letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . Remembering the kiss , Charlie stopped writing and for some minuteslived again in that feeling , relived it and floated once again inp98that sustaining air . Then he shook himself , poured water into the bowl , doused his head , and splashed his face . Wake up , Charlie , he told himself . Wake up . Come to . Kissing 's not the job you came to Pendleton to do . Defend the accused . Send Pa the news . Try to keep your hands off the preacher 's daughter . That 's the line of action for you to take . He looked back over what he had written . What Ben had said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she knew all the boy knew . That was between him and Hannah and no business of readers of the Western Spy . He dried his face and hands and sat down to rewrite his report . Ora Bemis arrived at the Cape house soon after Charlie left on his return trip to Pendleton . She was on foot , bedraggled , downcast , bigger each day with child . Afternoon had passed and evening had not yet arrived . It was the nameless part of the day ; dayshine past and sundown colors not yet arrived . The Cape cabin door stood open . The house needed all the freshening sunshine it could get after absorbinga winter of wood smoke and the smell of boiling beans and drying moccasins . Ora , at the open door , called , " Lizzie , it 's Ora . " Lizzie , polishing case knives with brick dust , wiped her hands on her apron . " Ora , you think you should be traipsing around the countryside , as far along as you are ? " " My mind 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and careful as I could . " " Well , come in and rest now . I 'll make you a cup of tea . " " It 's Cale I came to see . " Lizzie had been a preacher 's wife too long to be surprised at the number of women who needed to have a talk with her husband . She sometimes wondered if their need would be as great if the man of God were a woman of God . Ora was n't one of the women she wonderedabout . Ora had her own man . " Caleb 's out milking , Ora . He ought to be in any minute now . " " What I 've got to say is private , Lizzie . I 'll go on out to the cowshednow . That 'd be all right , wo n't it ? " " Caleb 'd be glad for company . " Caleb was down to stripping the cow when Ora came into the shed . " Sit down , Ora , " he said , motioning to the last of winter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I do n't take all Daisy 's got , she'llp99get the idea she can let up on making milk . I ca n't let her get any idea like that . " When tugging and squeezing produced no more , Caleb hung the bucket on a peg and went over to stand above Ora . " Should you have walked over here ? " " I rested a good many times . " " How 's Lute ? " " Like he was when you saw him . Cale , have you told anyone ? What he told you ? " " Not a living soul . " " Not even Lizzie ? " " She 's a living soul . " Ora could n't smile , but her face showed that inside she recognized that a smile would not be out of order . " You think Lute has to go through with it ? " " I still think Lute 's got Lo do what he thinks right . You know that . He 's a converted man . He 's God 's man . You and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can pray , ca n't I ? " " You can pray . But do n't ask God to upset His own laws . " " What law has God got about this ? " " About half the Ten Commandments . Do n't bear false witness , ' for one . And a few not there . Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's . ' " " Who 's our Caesar ? Colonel Johnston ? " " And Secretary Calhoun and the federal government . And GovernorRay . " " They ca n't stop me from praying . " " No . But there 're some prayers God ca n't answer . You ask God to strike me and Daisy both dead , and I misdoubt your prayer 'll be answered . " Ora , who had been half crying , began half laughing . " You know I 'm not going to ask God to kill your cow , Cale . " " How about me ? " " You said yourself God would n't do it . What 'd be the use ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lute does what he thinks isright ? And ask God to give you the strength to stand by him ? " " Lute 's going to do it anyway , ai n't he , Cale ? " " I hope so . And if he do n't , the court 'll make him . " " He 'd feel better doing it on his own ? " " Do n't you think so ? "  | " Yes . Pray for me , Cale . " Caleb got down on his knees at Ora 's feet . He did n't know a thing he could ask the Lord but to strengthen Lute in his resolve to do right , and to comfort Ora in what likely lay ahead . He ended his prayer , " Bless this babe-to-be , here in the straw , as Thou blessed another Babe born in the straw . All this we ask in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost . " Before he could pronounce " Amen , " Ora was out of the straw , imploring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . I do n't want my baby killed . Like that other One . " " He brought blessings , did n't He ? " " I do n't want any blessings that come from killing . " " Jesus did n't kill . " " He was killed . I do n't like that , either . Why do men put killing and dying and blessing so close together ? " " What would you have , Ora ? " " No killing , no killing . Then blessings would n't matter . We would n't feel the need . " " We need God 's blessing . " " No , we do n't . All we need is to love each other . Cale Cape , you got Lute into this . He was a happy man until you got him saved and started him to worrying about his soul and what was right and what was wrong . " " He 's a better man now . " " I do n't care about better . I care about happy . Why did you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him . God did . " " Will God take care of him now ? " " Yes . " " You mean , take him to Heaven when he dies ? " " I hope so . " " I mean now , now . " Ora scrambled across the slippery hay . " Will He take care of him now ? " " The hairs of our head are numbered in His sight . " Ora , who had been standing straight as a pike stick , a foot lower than Caleb , but staring him straight in the eye , wilted . " You do n't know and you wo n't say . Stay away from my husband , Cale Cape . I will pray that Lute forgets he ever laid eyes on you . " Ora ran out of the shed , and Caleb did n't try to- stop her . Shewas of a mind to tussle if anyone laid a hand on her , and Calebknew it . Jacob had wrestled with an angel , but Caleb was no angelp101and Jacob was n't in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Ora until she had safely crossed the branch . The day of sweet warmth was ending in a red glare . The water had a blood sheen . Tomorrow would be even warmer . He went into the house slowly , head lowered . " What 's the matter , Caleb ? " He was heartsick and could n't use his best remedy for that disease : tell Lizzie all about it . " Could n't you help Ora any ? " " No . She would n't have anything to do with the only kind of help I had to offer . " " She 's backslid ? " " I told her I would n't talk to anyone about her trouble . " " I put the kettle on for tea for Ora . I 'll make you a cup . " While he was drinking , Hannah came in with the bucket of milk . She was rosy and glowing , a strapping milkmaid , if ever he saw one . " Pa , you 're getting forgetful . Milk the cow and leave the milk out-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man thanks you . " He thanked God he did n't have a notionate flyaway girl like Ora Bemis.  |p102Next  Sunday morning , Caleb and Lizzie were still in bed , though planning every minute to get up . It was a couple of hours before sunup , but by the feel of the air that seeped into the room , down the chimney and through the chinks , they knew the day would be balmy for April . " Praise God for that , " said Lizzie . Her head was on Caleb 's shoulder , the last rest and comfort she would have that day  --  and the way things were going , perhaps forever . The fit of man and woman always surprised her . It was a detail you might have thought God would n't have had the time or foresight to arrange . The heavy bone of a man 's big shoulder left a hollow before it reached the bulge of the muscle in his upper arm that just fitted a woman 's head . Her hair was as springy as a down pillow there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and big muscle , soft when not in use , formed a bowl just skull-sized . My skull , Lizzie thought comfortably . " When was the last time we had a real Sunday , Lizzie ? Got to sleep a little late and could look forward to the peace and fellowship of a church service to follow ? " Caleb asked . " Before the killings , " Lizzie said , then wished she had n't used those words . Now they 'd have to face the day that was ahead of them . " Church has about lost its meaning here . " " We could have a regular service before they arrive . Just the two of us . " " It 'll have to be right here and now , then , otherwise they 'll start riding in before you 've put a comb to your hair . " " What about you ? " " I 'm a short horse and soon curried . " " You 'll have to shave today . " " I will for a fact . Ca n't be outshined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ' ti1 eleven . " " The time set ai n't going to carry a pennyworth of weight with folks who want to see this day 's meeting . There 'll be people here who 've been traveling all night , or I miss my guess . They 're fordingp103cricks and trying to follow traces from as far away as Indianapolis this very minute . " " Indians and whites have sat down together before . " " Not for any powwow like this . Indians being told white men 'll be hung if found guilty of killing them . " " They been told a lot of things before this that never turned out . " " Not by Johnston . " " Why is Johnston having the people here at all ? Why do n't he take them straight to Pendleton ? " " Here 's where it happened , Lizzie . Here 's the sore spot  --  and the hotheads . If anybody 's liable to fly off the handle about the killings up north , or the trial in Pendleton , it 's the people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here 's where oil has got to be poured on the water . And if I do n't miss my guess , the Indians Johnston will bring in here will make everybody think twice before they decide to tangle with them . " " What kind of a man is the colonel ? " " He 's nothing special to look at . Not at first glance . Second glance tells you here 's a man that do n't back up . He 's hewn out of the old rock . You could pull every toenail out of him and he would n't change expression . The Indians know this . They do n't fool with him . They ai n't got no cause to . So far . He 's worked for them . " " Is he a good man ? " " In the sight of God I reckon he is . In the sight of most whites he 's a traitor . " " Could n't a fight break out here today ? So many men hating the Indians . " " It 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife or a gun beyond the lane into our place . Johnston 's seen to that . " " Can he just give orders ? " " He can . And he 's got militia down at the foot of the lane to see his orders are carried out . " " Right now ? " " They slept the night there . " " You did n't tell me . " " No use your getting worked up . " " They 're going to protect us . Ai n't they , Caleb ? " " Yes . But if I 'd told you , you might have got to thinking who they 're going to protect us from . " A cock crowed , one of their own , likely . They were too far fromp104the Bemises ' to hear crowing unless the wind was carrying from that direction . " Did someone turn in our place ? " Lizzie asked . " Like as not . But you listen to me , Lizzie . Do n't start asking people in . The house wo n't hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once they got in , you 'd feel you had to feed them  --  and there ai n't enough supplies in the settlement to feed the crowd 'll be here today . In the third place , the Indians do n't want to come inside . They ai n't used to chairs , and much as they trust Johnston , they do n't trust us . They 'd think what we had in mind was to get them inside and set the place on fire  --  the way we did at . . . " Lizzie stopped him before he could finish his sentence . " We ? There 's not a person here would think of doing a thing like that . " " Whites thought of it once . That 's what Indians remember . " " Well , I do n't want any Indians in my house anyway . A lot of them are light-fingered . " " You 've never seen any Indians like the ones you 'll see today . There 's nothing in our house they ai n't got better . Look what Clasby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor town reds down around Pendleton  --  drunks and beggars , and thieves if you give them a chance . They were n't that way ' til we came along . Johnston will bring Indians here today we ai n't touched yet . Chiefs and braves in furs and skins and war bonnets ' til we 'll all stand chopfallen before them in our calicoes and linsey-woolsies . " " We 're all equal in the sight of God , " Lizzie said . Caleb laughed ' til the bed shook . " God save me from arguing with women . Men ai n't women 's equal when it comes to that . " Lizzie was offended . " I was n't arguing . I was repeating what I 've heard you say a million times . " " I said it the other end to . " " Listen . There 's more horses , " Lizzie said . " If there 's going to be any church here today , it 'll have to be here and now , " Caleb told her . " I ca n't pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where I said most of my prayers when I was a youngun . " " Well , I ai n't a youngun any more . Could you sing a hymn in bed , Caleb ? " Caleb demonstrated . " Hush up , Caleb . You 'll bring the children downstairs . "  | " Nothing wrong with singing hymns on Sunday . And the better the place , the better the deed , I always heard . " When Caleb was in a bantering mood there were only two things to do : ignore him or give him his head . Lizzie ignored him . She knelt by her side of the bed , her face deep in the covers . Caleb joined her . Not touching her . He 'd told her long ago never to lay a hand on him when he was praying . " God 's got His hand out to me . I know that . But I 'm an earth-bound man by nature and the bond could be broken very easy . " The creak of wheels up at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , then rose . Ben , who had tried to hide himself from himself , felt at home with the crowd of strangers who filled the yard . To them he was n't the Cape boy , who had been at the sugar camp at the time of the killing ; to them he could be an onlooker from far down in White River country , or perhaps a Buckeye up from Ohio , or a Keystone state man from distant Pennsylvania . He did n't look a whit different from these strangers , and no one paid him the least heed , not even Hannah , who usually kept an eye on him . She was a hen and he was her only chick ; that 's what he 'd heard said . That time was now long past . Hannah did n't know he lived or breathed today . She was so busy talking to one of the trial lawyers , she would n't have noticed if he 'd dropped dead in his tracks . He was accustomed to having her answer the questions that left him dumb-struck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and mother ; they were shaking hands and talking , no different from the way he 'd seen them at a protracted meeting . He knew the Cape yard better than any out-of-state man and had chosen a better place to watch than most : the angle where barnyard fence met the barn . He had a wall to lean against , a squared-off rail to sit on , and a good round sapling to brace his feet against . In case of any trouble , he could be up and into the barn at the first click of a trigger  --  or war whoop . No Indians had arrived yet , but a space was kept clear for them . That 's what the people were here for : to hear the Indians say they 'd be willing to let the white men take the punishment of the white killersinto their own hands . If the Indians did n't believe white men were going to do that , they 'd swoop down five hundred or a thousand strong . That 's what Johnston , the Indian agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek settlement , of the town of Pendleton , and of every human being living between . Ben was so interested in the crowd , he scarcely noticed that he had been joined on the top rail . Squirming around to find out who had crowded in , he saw a man who , except for his clothes , looked like a blacksmith  --  big , dark , and somehow sooty-looking because of the stub ends of the dark beard under his skin . His hands were as big as a blacksmith 's , but Ben could see on second glance they had never handled horseshoes or hammers . His shoulders were up on a level with Ben 's , and his butt , though big , was firm . It did n't give an inch when Ben shoved into it to keep from being pushed through the barn wall . " You feeling pinched ? " the man asked , kindly . Ben was , but hesitated to say so . Some soft fiber in him ( he was ashamed of it as being unmanly ) made him hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ashamed to learn it , he thought . He was ashamed when he was in the wrong , and he had had too little experience of the world to understand that the world was n't made up of duplicates of Ben Cape . " I 'm O. A. Dilk , " the man next him said . " I shoved in here on purpose . You 're Ben Cape , are n't you ? " Ben did n't see any way of avoiding a yes to that , though he preferredremaining a stranger with other strangers . O. A. Dilk did n't make any remarks about the sugar camp . He did say , " I 'm a lawyer for the state . " Ben was n't positive what a lawyer for the state did , but he was pleased that he had been right in guessing the man was n't a blacksmith . " Who 's the beauty over there talking to silver-tongued Charlie Fort ? " Ben did n't see any beauties , but when Dilk pointed , he had to admit , " That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for some family resemblance . Ben knew it was n't there . " You 'll likely see plenty of lawyers the next couple of months , " said Dilk , dropping the sister subject . Ben kept his mouth shut . " All of them shining up to your sister ? " said Dilk . This was a new idea to Ben . He was n't in the dark about Hannah 's feeling for Johnny Wood , but Johnny , as far as he could tell , would choose a book any day over Hannah . Maybe lawyers were more hotbloodedthan other people.  | " You know all the people here , Ben ? " Dilk asked . " I know our neighbors . " " You know the families of the prisoners ? " " I seen Mrs. Wood here . " " Point her out to me . " Ben pointed . " I thought she 'd be older . " " She is old , " Ben said , for whom old age began at about thirty-five . After that everyone was old . He was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very much older than Johnny Wood . He was twice as big , with not a gray hair in his head and a big cleft in his chin . Ben would never have thought the state would choose a lawyer with a dimple in his chin . He would n't . It looked childish . " Mrs. Benson not here ? " Ben pointed . " The one with all the younguns ? " Ben nodded . " I 'd think they 'd all stay home . " " They want to see the Indians . " " Their pa did n't have any love of Indians . " " Who told you ? " " Why do you think he 's in jail ? " " Lots of people get in jail by mistake . " " You 're a smart boy . And lots that ought to be there are passed over by mistake . " Ben looked at O. A. Dilk . If I was in trouble , I 'd like him on my side , not against me , he thought . He kept his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dilk said . Ben was silent . " Your sister , Hannah , found Clasby 's saddlebags with stuff he had stolen from the sugar camp . Thieving as well as killing . " " How do you know that ? " " That 's what I 'm here for , to find out facts like that . Then to prosecutethe guilty . " " Prosecute ? " " See that they are punished . " " Hung ? " " If guilty . That 's the law . Who 's that big fellow ? " " The one with . . . " Ben was too delicate-minded to say , " The woman who 's going to have a baby . " Dilk said it for him . " Mr. and Mrs. Bemis are their names . " " Poor lady , " said Dilk . " Poor lady . "  |p108Ben  knew having a baby was no treat for a woman , but he 'd never heard them pitied before because of it . He was hungry . He had had nothing since breakfast , and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last person had left the place . " We ca n't feed them all , and there 's no use tantalizing them with the sight of food . Now you can stay out of the house and if your pangs get so you ca n't stand them , sneak into the barn and have a couple of mouthfuls of chicken food . That 'll keep you going ' til night-fall . " He was thinking about doing that when all the people in the yard turned as if by a single lever to face outward and every one , as if all their throats had become one big throat , half yelled , half whispered , " Here they come . " It was the Indian chiefs who were coming . They moved into the lane where the other visitors had been forbidden to come . " They 're not supposed to ride in , " said Ben . " Other people could n't . " " They can , " Dilk told him . " Johnston arranged with your pa . If you were a dozen Indians would you walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had just finished killing your women and children ? " Ben did n't say anything . " Not if you had good sense , you would n't , " Dilk answered for him . Ben kept his mouth shut . He was n't sure what sound would come out if he opened it . Maybe he 'd yell a warning like any boy seeing Indians crouched behind the farm 's snake fence before making a run for the safety of the house . Maybe the sound would be a whoop for joy , the way it was when geese went over in a shifting V half as big as the sky , crying their own messages back and forth . Maybe he 'd turn his face to the barn , hide it in his arms , and cry for Folded Leaf , who 'd never grow up now to ride a horse like this . He made some sound . " You never seen the like , did you ? " He never had . He did n't know the like existed . Fifteen men , not on half-starved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all colors , but all high-stepping , came up the lane . " They do n't look like Indian horses . " " Most of them likely stolen . " " Ai n't you here to defend the Indians ? " " I 'm here to prosecute men who kill Indians . "  |p109At  the head of the line , which was coming at a walk , giving everyone time to take them in , regalia and mounts , were three white men . " They squaw men ? " Ben asked . Dilk snorted , deep as an old man 's snort , thick and phlegmy . " There 's Indians coming here who have powwowed with the President of the United States himself . You call President Monroe a squaw man ? He 's talked with Indians . " " He never come riding into our place with a bunch of them . " " Back here in the woods you think anybody who says howdy to an Indian is a squaw man . The first horseman in that line is General James Noble , United States senator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben did n't . General Noble was thin and straight as a musket . He rode his horse solid as a heavier man . He was no woman 's man , Ben thought , squaw or white . He 'd like to see the woman who 'd yell to the general , " Bring me in an armful of wood while you 're about it . " The general belonged to the general . " Who 's that coming next ? " " Colonel Johnston . " " The agent ? " Dilk nodded . Johnston was as big and heavy as Dilk himself , but colored yellow and white like a miller , instead of dark like a smith . He was burly enough to hoist sacks ; his face sharp and his eyes going everywhere . He would keep tab on whose corn meal was whose , and no arguing about it later . " Connor , owner of the inn at Connorsville , is riding with John-ston . " Connor was , in looks , the soldier of the outfit , more like a general than even Noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed the general of his fierceness . Connor was the equal of any Indian in the saddle and on a better horse . A lot of blood would flow before anybody scalped him . Maybe that was why the Indians were his friends . Behind the three white men came the Indians , a line of them , who , because of their headdresses , looked as much like birds or beasts as men . Nothing had prepared Ben for the sight , no pictures , nobody 's accounts . " I never seen Indians like them before . " " Not many people have . "  |p110A  band of angels would have been less startling . Ben knew how they would look ; like himself , only with wings and long gold hair . This was n't a war party . There was no war paint . But there was enough finery to start a war . If Clasby , who had looted the sugar camp for the few pelts there , could see the skins and furs and feathers and jewelry now riding up the lane , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , it was n't a war party , and the Indians were outnumberedten to one . Ben was n't afraid . Why , then , did his scalp tighten up so ? Why were his ears pulled up so high they ached , and why had the back of his neck turned ice-cold ? If he was n't afraid , what was he ? Eagle feathers coming up the lane made into a cap and the cap finished off with a beak and glaring eyes . Hawk feathers held in place with a silver band . Owl feathers shaped like a pinwheel . Earrings , shoulder-long , swinging . Doeskin white as chalk . Tanned skins the color of sassafras bark . Black wolf fur , shiny as chokecherries . Spotted lynx . Snow rabbit . Ermine paws . The nearest he 'd seen to anything like this was a line of maple and beech and hickory trees after the first hard frost had hit them . The nearest he 'd felt to anything like this  --  well , he 'd have to think about that . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dilk harrumphed again . Ben wished he 'd cough and spit . " Indianfighters are n't like our soldiers . They do n't all dress alike . Rich Indians have better clothes than poor ones . Young warriors do n't dress like great chiefs . " They 're like women , Ben thought . Not in dresses , like women , but in putting on their best and wearing beads and feathers and bright colors . Not a sound was made except by the horses , the clop of their feet and a stud 's occasional whistling snort . The Indians were still , no movement except as they were moved by their horses ' swing , which they held down to a running walk . The onlookers were as quiet as the oncomers . Once in a while a man in the waiting crowd made a horselike wheezing sound himself , as if words that had come up as far as his teeth had been choked off there . Babies cried , but babies cried no matter what . " Are they all one tribe ? " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Senecas got killed . But Senecas have killed so many Indians themselvesthey ai n't overflowing with friends . There 's a Miami there . A Winnebago maybe , though the Senecas tore them to pieces a while back . Oneidas . They 're a part of the Five Nations , along with thep111Senecas . There 's a breed or two there . One of the women killed at the sugar camp was mostly white . " Ben made a sound softer and more broken than that of the horses being reined in . " You choke on something ? " Dilk asked . He had choked on his tears . Better to keep Dilk talking . " Have you lived with Indians ? " " I was brought up in New Jersey . " " How do you know so much about Indians ? " " I 'm here to prosecute men for killing Indians . I 've got to know something about the men they killed . " The line of horsemen was all in the yard in the space that had been kept clear . Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdresses : beaks stronger than eagle beaks and eyes harder than owls ' . Except for Folded Leaf , who had first come to the camp three or four years ago , Ben did n't know any Indians . He was ashamed to look at the Indians in Pendleton ; dirty and drunk , staggering and begging . He would n't want anyone to look at him if he was in their case . He tried to do as he would be done by . In Pendleton , he lowered his eyes . These Indians asked to be looked at . They were Folded Leaf grown tall . They were Black Antler grown rich and a chief of his people . He wanted to say something about these horsemen , these braves bedecked with beads and feathers . " They make us look like a bunch of sick muskrats , " he said . " Nonsense , " said Dilk . " They 're savages . These men you see have eaten dogs . Worse than that , the hearts and livers of their enemies . They 'll keep a man alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 've run red-hot pokers up the asses of white men . They . . . " Ben would n't let him finish . " If I was an Indian , I would n't have you for my lawyer . " " I 'm not their lawyer . I 'm the state 's lawyer , prosecuting white men for breaking the law . It 's against the law to murder human beings . The law do n't say that if the human being ate dogs or men 's livers , he can be murdered . The law 's got to be respected . I do n't care what the savage did , the law do n't give a man the right to kill him . " " Folded Leaf was n't a savage . He never ate dogs . He never ate anybody 's liver . " Ben was crying . " How do you know ? " " He was my friend . " " Was n't ten pretty young for the best friend of a boy of fourteen ? "  | " How do you know how old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for . To find out things like that . " " He was n't ten . He was twelve , but little . " " Big enough to swing a tomahawk . Or fire a gun , I reckon . " " He did n't have a gun or a tomahawk . And Black Antler taught him not to kill . " " Who 's Black Antler ? " " His teacher . I studied with Folded Leaf . I learned what he learned . " " How to scalp ? " " No . I learned by heart verses like Bible verses , only Indian . " " All forgotten now ? " " No . I dreamed that the sun in the firmament spoke to me . He told me that the Great Spirit is very angry with Indians for their wicked ways . Tell them they must repent their wicked ways and forsakethem or the judgments of the Great Spirit will come upon them . If they do not repent . . . " " Who said all this ? " Dilk asked . " This Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of Corn Planter . Black Antler taught what Handsome Lake preached . That 's what Folded Leaf was going to do . " " Well , Folded Leaf made a mistake when he fought the whites , did n't he ? " " He did n't fight the whites . Nobody had any chance to fight the whites . You said you came here to find out what happened . Why do n't you ask people who really know ? " " I am , " Dilk said . " I 'm asking you . " Ben took one look at Dilk , saw that he meant what he said , then jumped down from the top rail and pushed his way through the crowd into the barn . He was n't hungry any more but he chomped on corn to ease his feelings . Chomped on corn ' til his gums bled . O. A. Dilk spread out a little more comfortably after Ben 's departure . Any other way of getting at him would have made the boy dry up . He was n't a man who liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be weighed against every other thing . Better the boy suffer some now , and because of it decide to tell what should be told , than clamp his teeth shut and keep the truth from being known . The Indians and the three white men did n't dismount . There was going to be a palaver , and Johnston intended that he and the chiefs be heard . Down on the ground some shoving might start ; and shovingp113led to blows , and blows to blood , and finally what happened at the sugar camp might seem a frolic compared with this . Dilk was glad to be working with Johnston . The man was an anvil . Hit him and the sparks flew , but he did n't budge . The Fall Creek folks did n't give Johnston credit for it , but what he had done and was doing had saved and was saving them from being wiped out  --  houses burned , hair lifted , stock slaughtered or stolen . There were no Indians so proud and vengeful as the Seneca . They believed that the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their killing were themselves slain . It was a duty the Seneca accepted with enthusiasm . Dilk had no idea how Johnston had been able to persuade these masters of revenge and retaliation into letting the white man take care of the punishing . It was possible that to the Indians the nasty business of white men pinioning the arms of other whites , then lettingthem dangle at the end of a rope , fighting in mid-air for breath , was a revenge sweeter than any they could devise . " They are killing their own . " That would be a sight they might like to see . Johnston was likely the only man whose word they would accept in such matters . He had never lied to them . And if he lied this time , there would be nothing to prevent their carrying out their first plan : bum , scalp , slaughter . Johnston was counting on the settlers to rememberthis . Dilk was , too . The agent had brought the right men in the right dress and on the right horses . Where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods Indians could ride , though they did most of their traveling on foot or in canoes . But they had no such numbers of good mounts as these . Johnston had had no need to outfit them so far as clothes went . An Indian told who he was in two ways that the white did not : by his body , naked or next to it ; and by the display on his body of a rich covering , which told where he had been and what he had done and who in his tribe he was . The very sight of these big men , reared up proud as birds of prey , pennants of animal scuts and feathers flying from their upheld lances , shrunk the settlers down to rail-chopper size . Dilk , a big man seated on the top rail , felt himself dwindle before their display of strength . Johnston , for all that he was riding with a general who had become a senator and Connor , a rich innkeeper , was the best mounted there : a fifteen-hand blood bay with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band he had got together and he spoke first . He had a deep , tumbling voice , sometimes hard to understand . Johnston appeared top114know this . He spoke slowly , a word at a time . Every person with two ears and a brain between them could hear and understand what he was saying . " White people can read and write . Or most of us can . Because of this we have long records on paper which we can read and reread . And all these records tell us how much we have suffered at the hands of the Indians . " The Indians do n't have any way of keeping track of what they have suffered at our hands , no records that we can read . And if they did have , we probably would n't read them anyway . But I have been keeping records and I can tell you they have suffered . " Many of these happenings you know about already and I do n't intend to keep you standing out here for the time it would take to recount one-tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know about . It 's not my place to determine who were the killers ; or why they killed . A court of law will decide that . The Indians know who the dead are . They know that kin of theirs were killed by men of this neighborhood . They know that the dead were not warriors or horse thieves . Nine people died . Seven of the dead were women and children . They know that . " They know  --  you do , too  --  what happened to some Wyandots over in Hancock County a few years back . A Wyandot chief with his wife was on a hunting expedition . Three white men came to his camp and asked to spend the night . The Wyandots were Christians . They shared their camp with those they supposed to be their Christianbrothers . They fed them . They knelt and said their prayers with them . Then they went to bed . As soon as they were asleep , these white men rose up on them with axes , killed them , robbed their camp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught and put in prison . But very soon after , while the officials were looking the other way , they broke jail and escaped . And that was all the punishment they ever had : the inconvenience of a few days in prison . " I have told the chiefs with me that this will not happen here . That we will try , then punish , those found guilty of murdering Indians in exactly the same way we try and punish those who murder white men . I have told them that we will not have a mock trial . That there will be no jail breaks after the sentencing . If the accused are found guilty and condemned to hang , they will hang , and the hanging will be public . " Only because they believe me have these chiefs been able top115keep their young men from descending upon you . It is not Indian nature to suffer in this way without reprisal . Some have become Christians , but turning the other cheek comes less natural to an Indian than to any other people I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The first is a Seneca . His English name is Sun Fish . Two hundred braves look to him for command . He will speak in his own language ; what he says will be interpreted for you . You should listen well . " Johnston should have been a lawyer , Dilk thought . His witnesses were well chosen . Sun Fish was a young chief , his face full of violence and his eyes aglitter with hatred and pride . He did n't need to say a word to convince those looking up at him astride his roan that , except for Johnston 's promises , he would , with or without the help of his two hundred braves , attempt to avenge the deaths of his kinsmen . His speech was short , clanged out in a rush of brassy sounds . He spoke as a man who scorned words , who had other and better means of defense . He did n't pause between words as Johnston had done , but threw what he had to say at them , in one hard blow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without books . What had happened , what they believed , what their wise men had said , had no place of storage other than their heads . The translator spoke as if the speech were his own . Even his voice had the clang of Sun Fish 's . " There is a treaty between your people and mine . We are not at war . This was not a fight between warriors . There was a time when we called each other brothers . I do not call you brothers today . Brothersdo not kill each other 's women and children . We have been promisedthat the murderers will be punished . We have promised that we will wait and see . We are waiting . " The Seneca wheeled his horse and rode slowly down the lane away from the crowd . He had had his say . Dilk scanned the faces of the listeners . From these men and others like them would come a jury he must convince . What these men had just heard would make his task easier . The departure of Sun Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let him go without a look . The impression he wanted to make on the settlers was one of Indian unity . " One of the men killed is represented here by his uncle . He is Mingo , son of the great Mingo . " Mingo was a man of forty or more . The grooves from his nosep116to his mouth were like runnels in clay land after a hard rain . No Indianwas more richly dressed and ornamented than he . Unlike Sun Fish , he spoke slowly and quietly . When he had finished , the translator , also speaking slowly and quietly , said , " I was born by the falls below here . This was all Indian country . There was food for all . No man , red or white , was ever turned away from the red man 's lodge hungry . The land belonged to all . We killed only the animals we needed to eat . Then the white man came . He killed for pleasure and money . The land belonged to whateverman could seize it . The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many times . Only this much land and no more . ' Pushed back , pushed back . Driven from our own homes , from our own forests , from our own streams . While taking the sugar sap from our own trees , our women and children are killed . " We had no jails , no judges . We had no thefts . And except in war or in the drunkenness you brought to us , no killing . You have these . " If you do not punish the wrongdoers in your way , we will punish them in ours . The agent says you will do this . If he is right , only the guilty will die . If he is wrong , you must blame yourselves . " Mingo was as self-contained as Sun Fish was tempestuous . When he had finished speaking , he moved his horse quietly back into the group behind Colonel Johnston . The colonel was silent for a time after those speeches  --  letting the words sink in . The words had sunk in . There was no outcry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Indians are not great speechmakers . " This , Dilk knew , was less than the truth . When it came to speechmakingold Tom Jefferson himself had to back down . Dilk had read history and the settlers had n't . What Johnston wanted to convey was that the Indians did n't fight with their mouths . They talked with their mouths , more eloquently than most white men could manage . They honored their speechmakers as white men did n't honor theirs . " All wind and no weather " tended to be the white man 's judgment about a talker . The Indian was more all of a piece . A man good with words was n't , in their opinion , handicapped in his use of a tomahawk or arrow . So Johnston wanted the listeners to remember that these talkers were also fighters . " Now we ride to Pendleton to say there what we have said here . The chiefs will then depart for their homes and the trial will begin . "  |p117The  horsemen rode off the Cape place through a quiet crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hear a sound like that of a hive of disturbed bees : a sound of breaths sucked in , of heart thumps , of groans , of belly rumbles . But what could they do ? The agent had asked nothing unreasonable . " You made these laws . Now keep them . " He had the right . But had Indians the right ? To stand up bald-faced and say , " When you kill us , you murder . Hanging is your way with murderers . Keep to your ways . " There was no doubt in Dilk 's mind that many men in Cape 's yard , if they thought they could do it , would mow down all Indians present  --  andtheir agent first of all . Mow them down and to hell with what came next . But other men were thinking twice ; and some women were crying ; and some , like Indians themselves , had squatted on the dry , sweet April ground and had put their arms on their knees and had buried their heads in their arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power rise in him to win it . He saw the Cape boy , his great lank of a redheaded sister , and Fort , the young Ohio defense lawyer , standing together over by the wellhead . Fort was not the chief defense lawyer , any more than he , Dilk , was the chief prosecutor , but they both came to the trial with reputationsto defend  --  and to make . He had to see the Cape boy again ; it would be good manners to have a word with Fort ; and Hannah , apart from any trial maneuvers , struck him as being a manifestation of the mysterious ways in which God moved . He had prayed God for guidance when the chance came to take this appointment : lost in the backwoods , trying to persuade white men to do what they had never done before , to have one law for both the white man and the red man . It was not a job he had much stomach for . He needed to stay in the public eye if he was to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He needed to win cases if he was to get elected . But after praying , he had decided that , in spite of all the drawbacks , it was his duty , even if out of the public eye , and in danger of losing the case , to take his stand for the law which he intended to serve . He had never expected to find as reward here in the backwoods a girl like Hannah Cape . She would grace , she would light up , any marble staircase , Indiana or Washington . The Cape boy had a bloody mouth . " You been in a fight , son ? " Dilk asked . Ben wiped the back of his hand across his mouth , then examinedp118the stains . " I chewed down too hard on some cracked corn , I reckon . " Dilk had half expected Ben to run on sight , but he stood his ground and answered the question , which was n't really Dilk 's business . Ben did n't know , however , that etiquette required him to introducehis sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Cape , may I make myself known ? I 'm O. A. Dilk , lawyer for the prosecution . " Hannah said , " I 'm pleased to meet you , Mr. Dilk . " " Oscar , is n't it ? " Fort said , not waiting for further formalities . It was . But Dilk did n't fancy Oscar as the name for a rising young politician . George and Thomas and John were the names of presidents . ' Where did any Oscars come in ? He tried to hide behind initials . He could n't expect Fort to have any interest in such an undertaking . And he could n't expect , and did n't want , Hannah to be calling him " Mr. Dilk . " She certainly was n't going to be Miss Cape to him any longer than he could help . Fort , who was a smooth-tongued man , he had always heard , began to prove it . " That bunch of Indian dandies did n't help my cause any . " " What do you consider your cause , Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending themselves against savages who have been molesting them for a hundred and fifty years . What 's yours ? " " The law . But I 'm sure that Miss Hannah does n't want to have the trial argued here . " " I do n't want to have it argued at all . Now or ever , " Hannah said . " You want to leave it to Indian justice ? " Dilk asked . There was room for brain behind the girl 's white brow  --  and plenty of space for heart , too , lower . " I want it never to have happened . " Dilk smiled . She was a woman . " We live from day to day in what has happened , and in what will happen , if we do n't act . " " Hannah , " said Fort , " we 're going to have the trial argued here and now , like it or not . " Dilk would n't have that , have himself put in the light of being a sobersides while Fort and Hannah had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock horns with Fort . Leave that for the trial , and let it be seen then who was the better man . " Miss Hannah , " he said , " Ben and I had our talk cut short by the speechmaking . If you 'll excuse us , we 'll go on with it . "  |p119Charlie  Fort could charm a bird out of a tree . This was n't his fault , but the ability made some people back off from him . The charm , they were convinced , was n't the man himself but something he exuded like birdlime to catch the unwary . Such persons were proud of themselves for escaping . They had scorn for those who did not . The Charlie-resisters attached themselves to some blunt bumblehead , proud of their ability to discern qualities more than skin deep . Mrs. Culligan , Charlie 's landlady , was n't unaware of Charlie 's charm , but she was knowledgeable enough to know that the best wood takes the highest polish . She was also too honest to fool herself into thinking that her feeling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had enough sense to keep her hands off him , and to recognize that a young lawyer working on a murder case did n't have time to gab with a woman who appeared to him to be an elderly widow . In her heart , however , she was a girl in love . And though she called herself " elderlywidow , " she knew from the attention paid her by men of thirty that her forty-five years did n't show . Her cheeks were pink , her hair as bronze-gold as it had been at twenty , and , when she had a mind to do it , she could cinch in her waist so that the belts she had worn twenty years ago still spanned her waist . Nevertheless , she tried to bear herself in Charlie 's presence like a good old aunt . This did n't prevent her from providing Charlie with comforts a landlady did n't usually give roomers .

Not that he did n't hit the nail on the head and hit it hard  --  but he used a funny hammer for the job . " If you want to write a story called Hannah , the Hoosier Maiden , ' I 'll try to get it published for you . But readers of the Spy generallyp120are not interested in the girls you spark , up there in the woods . And Hannah herself , or I miss my guess , would n't be very set up to see herself made reading matter by you for my subscribers . " Now I know you did n't intend parts of your letter for printing : but I tell you , son , it does n't even make proper reading for me .

Just telling you a fact : the words have n't been invented that 'll tell one man what anotherman feels about a woman . And I reckon especially son to father . Or vice versa . Even more specially vice versa , no doubt . " Did you ever think about trying your hand at poetry ? Pearly teeth , bosom like the drifted snow , heart of ice ? Spy readers understand words like that . " Another kind of thing I ca n't print . Or wo n't . In the Springfield , Ohio , paper , an article by General Sampson Mason says , As I entered the Pendleton courtroom the judge was sitting on a block , paringhis toenails ; just then the sheriff entered out of breath , and informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deputies were now running down the others . ' " Now I 'm not saying this was n't the case , though I know the generalcan draw the longbow . What I am saying is that I 'm not going to print stuff like that . I do n't consider when or where the judge trims his toenails news . And even if it was news , I 'm not going to put the Spy in the position of a city newspaper looking down its nose at folks out on the frontier . " I wo n't say I did n't get a chuckle myself out of that picture . What I suggest is that if there are happenings of that kind you put them on a sheet marked personal . Put Hannah there , too . If you have to write about her . If you do that , you 'll save me the trouble of sorting through your reports to weed out what 's not suitable for print . " You may save your own self from embarrassment by doing this .

" Now I 'm not trying to discourage your writing  --  or courting . I do n't know anything else that 's set this town on its ears like that trial in Pendleton . They ca n't hear enough about it . I may even be wrong about the judge 's toenails and Hannah . "  |p121Charlie  finished the letter , finished the clabber , and picked up his pen . Writing about Hannah was now out of the question . Pa was right . The words had n't been invented that would tell one man what anotherfelt about a woman . As to toenails , there was no way he could report this trial without reporting scenes nearly as outlandish . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : On the day the trial began , Judge McGowan was unable to preside , due to some temporary sickness . One of the side judges , Omer Oursley , took his place . Oursley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of business Isaac Vickers , defense attorney , rose and made a motion that the out-of-state defense lawyers be recognized . " Judge Oursley , " he said , " I ask that these gentlemen be admitted as attorneys and counselors at this bar . They are regular practitioners but they have not brought their licenses with them . " Judge Oursley said , " Have these men come here to defend the prisoners ? " " They have , " replied Vickers . " Let them be sworn , " Oursley said . " Nobody but a lawyer would defend a murderer . " Mr. Vickers was naturally taken aback at this kind of talk from a judge in a trial , the purpose of which was to decide if anyone had been murdered ; and if so , who the murderers were . He did n't let this deter him , once the attorneys were sworn , from getting on with the business of the defense . " I now move the court , " he said , " for a writ of habeas corpus to bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You demand what ? " Judge Oursley asked . " A writ of habeas corpus . " " For what ? What do you want to do with it ? " " To bring up the prisoners and have them discharged . " " Is there any law for that ? " Oursley asked . Vickers then read the statute regulating the writ of habeas corpus . Judge Oursley , the blacksmith , then said , " That act , Mr. Vickers , has been repealed long ago . " Vickers , an attorney of much experience , was not accustomed to being instructed about writs of habeas corpus by blacksmiths in frontier towns . He kept his temper in hand , but his manner was curt . " Your honor is mistaken about that . It is constitutional writ , as old as Magna Carta , and has never been repealed . " Judge Oursley was not in the least put out of face by Magna Carta.  | " Mr. Vickers , " he said , " to cut the matter short , it would do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail . I ironed them myself , and you will never get them irons off until they have been tried , habeas corpus or no habeas corpus . Motion overruled . " Soon after this wrangling between Judge Oursley and Mr. Vickers went on , Judge McGowan himself had recovered sufficiently to assumehis rightful position between the two side judges . Matters now went more smoothly . Judge McGowan ordered the grand jury to be called . All were present , answered to their names , and were sworn . The grand jury then brought into court an indictment for murder drawn by Mr. Armitageagainst each of the defendants . Readers of the Spy may be informed , albeit taken aback , by the rough-and-ready methods of this court . Their procedures may differ from those of more settled communities but their goals are the same : justice . This same grand jury , just before the present trial began , was presentedwith a case against a man for selling whiskey without a license . The jurors voted for a bill to be drawn . Armitage , the state 's prosecuting attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented it to the foreman and asked him to sign it . The foreman refused . " I sell whiskey without a license and always have . I do n't intend to indict others for what I do myself . " " If you do n't sign it , I 'll take you before Judge McGowan . " " What do I care for McGowan ? " asked the foreman . " He do n't know anything about selling whiskey  --  or making it , either . " Armitage is a man I will soon be confronting in the courtroom myself ; and I recount this happening not only as a report on how legal matters are handled in this neck of the woods but also as a reminder to myself of the nature of my honorable opponent . Armitage ordered the grand jury to follow him into court . In the courtroom he said , " Judge McGowan , the foreman of the grand jury refuses to sign his name to a bill of indictment against a man for sellingwhiskey without a license . " Judge McGowan asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill ? " " Yes , your honor . " " Foreman , " asked Judge McGowan , " do you refuse to sign the bill ? " " I do . " " Well , Mr. Prosecutor , " said McGowan , " I see no other way butp123to leave him to his conscience and his God . Take the grand jury back to their room . " Back in the grand jury room the foreman said , " I told you , Armitage , that Judge McGowan knew nothing about whiskey cases . " Armitage answered , " What the judge does n't know about such cases , I do . I will take the necessary legal steps to have the bill signed . " Armitage began to take off his coat . " The law now requires , " he said , " that the last step be taken . " " What step is that ? Ca n't you take it with your coat on ? " " No ; with a foreman like you , I ca n't . The last legal step with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill the majority of the jury has agreed to . " The whiskey-selling foreman had sampled too much of his product for too many years to be in any shape to stand up to Armitage , who is built like a bear and , from all I have seen of him , is about as badtempered . " I 'm not a fighting man , " the foreman said reasonably . " Hand me the bill . I 'll sign it . " When he had signed , Armitage marched the grand jury back into the court . " Has the foreman signed the bill ? " Judge McGowan asked . " He has , " Armitage replied . " I thought his conscience would n't let him rest until he had signed , " the judge said  --  not indicating that he knew the means Armitage had taken to arouse the foreman 's conscience . This is a digression from my reporting of the Pendleton case . But if you do n't understand the informal nature of the courts here in our great sister state , some of the happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that everything I report happened ; and happened with just as much verisimilitude as my pen can command . My hands are too full with preparing a defense for these imprisoned men to leave me any time for concocting possibly entertainingbut untrue stories . To get back to this trial , the trial jury was chosen and seated without any of the " tying up of jurors " as reported by General Mason in the Springfield paper . The jurors are all hardy , heavy-bearded fellows . Not one wears shoes  --  all wear moccasins , made by themselves or their women at home . And not one is without a side knife thrust in his belt . They are men who know the woods , who have fought their way west in spite of sickness and Indians . The first sight of themp124gave me considerable confidence . These are men , I thought , who know what it means to stand off the savages ; men who have managed to bring Christianity and civilization westward with them in spite of constant peril from the red man . The courtroom was crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came for no other reason than to see " the monkey show , " as they called it . Settlers from up Fall Creek and in Pendleton , whose lives may hang on the decision reached by this jury , were there and gave earnest attention to the trial . Friends and families of the accused men , their faces drawn with anxiety , were there . These were people I had come to know . The families of men I will be defending , clusteredtogether like sheep in a storm . They sat on the front benches with their minister , his wife , and two children with her . Next to the minister sat Luther Bemis and his wife , Ora . There 's more to tell , Pa , much more . I 'm too sleepy to continue now . I 'm not overly satisfied with the part I played in what follows but will try , when I get around to it , to give you an honest report of the proceedings . Enough to say now that the defense received a great shock  --  and setback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett.  |p125The  courthouse was already crowded when Caleb Cape , with his family and the Luther Bemises , arrived . A bench up front had been saved for them . Jonathan Armitage had seen to that . Hannah , Ben , and Lizzie went in first . Then Ora and Lute . Caleb had the seat on the aisle . The turnout for the trial turned Caleb 's stomach . It always did . Let a churn be stolen or somebody 's coon dog shot , and if the matter came to trial , settlers for twenty miles around traveled to hear the lawyers spiel . It was not to be expected that a trial like this , with generalsand United States senators and city lawyers from Ohio pleading , would go unnoticed . Or that the first trial of its kind , white men tried for murder for killing Indians , and already ironed and in jail , would not bring out ten times as many onlookers as usual . Caleb supposed that for settlers , lost off in hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another human being was a treat  --  trial or no trial . The arguing of the lawyers was for woodsies what play-acting was for city folks ; except that this was n't play-acting . There was n't any make-believe here . The tears shed would be real tear water flowing from the eyes of real people . The families that would be separated if the prisoners were convicted and given jail terms would be real  --  honest-to-God wives , real flesh-and-blood sons and daughters . Whatever the crowd 's purpose in congregating , the lawyers ' speechmakingwould be in itself a seven-day wonder . All those long-tailed words strung together without pause for breath , three hours at a time on occasion ! Why , it was more remarkable than watching dancing bears . Then there were those Indians , splendid as play actors ( though they were n't actors ) , upright as trees , at the back of the room . Their slit-stone-agate eyes saw every move that was made . Real playgoers never had to pay any heed to how the rest of the audience was reacting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whetting their knives or eying nearby heads for handy scalp locks.  |p126Caleb  understood all this . Still , he did n't like the flushed , staring faces  --  not much different from faces he 'd seen ogling a two-headed calf . Was anyone there praying ? For the men in jail ? For the Indian dead ? For the jury that would have to search its heart about right and wrong ? For the judge who would have to sentence ? Gawking and gaping , that was about the size and whole of it . He said so to Lizzie , and she whispered , " Shhh , " to him . He whispered again . " Somebody ought to open the windows in here . " Lizzie again whispered , " Shhh . " It was a mild day , and the heat of all those bodies packed into a space too small for them had raised the room 's temperature to that of humid midsummer . Only , the smell was n't that of midsummer . It was the smell of nervousness and fear , of curiosity and cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed since last November . He reached over , put a hand on Luther Bemis 's . Lute knew what that meant . Armitage was about to call him to the stand , and Caleb was giving him comfort . Or would give him a shove with a hand , hard and splintery as a roof shake , if he saw any signs of faltering . Lute would n't back down . He had committed himself ahead of time for fear of that very thing . He kept his eyes on Ora . He did n't know for how long he might be separated from her . He was n't sure what she might do now . She had never denied that what he planned to do was right , or that he should be the judge of what was right for him . But she had never been two-faced enough to pretend ( though she knew pleasing God had to come first with Lute ) that she herself felt at one with God if that meant prison for her husband . What she wanted first of all was for Lute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she preferred Lute wicked and with her , to separated and holy as Moses . The cross-grained devil that had lived in Luther Bemis so long was not yet dead enough to permit him to love wholeheartedly any woman who could say , " Forget me and do your duty . " Duty was his job . Lovinghim was hers . And Ora had always done that job so well , he half expected her to grab his coattails when Armitage called him and cry , " Stay , stay , you fool . " Did he half want her to ? Did he half believe that a God who trulyp127loved him would never ask him to go the whole way in this business of confessing his sins ? Armitage was speaking . He only half heard him but he knew what he was saying without hearing the words . Armitage was asking the court for permission to disregard for the time the indictment brought by the grand jury against John Wood , Sr. He wanted to bring another witness to the stand . Judge McGowan protested . The grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why drag out a trial that already promised to run on for days , perhaps weeks , with unnecessary formalities ? " Bring on your witness , " agreed Judge McGowan . " Will Luther Bemis , commonly known as Lute Bemis , please take the stand , " said Armitage . Lute had lived through this scene in his imagination so many times that he moved through the actuality like a man through a dream remembered . Ora did not cling to him . Caleb did not have to shove him forward . He did not feel floor boards beneath his feet . He floated past faces of neighbors and strangers as featureless now as bleached winter cabbages . Only , at the back of the room , the Indians were truly visible and themselves . What he had to say would be said to them . He would try to keep his eye on them as he talked . Fenton , the clerk , asked him to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . In God 's name , did they think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He glared at Fenton , then remembered that Fenton did not know , as Armitage did , what was to come next . Armitage started him from the beginning . Armitage was the state prosecutor . What Armitage cared about was getting a conviction . Lute knew that . He intended to tell the truth . If that convicted him , and it would , so be it . " Mr. Bemis , where were you on the evening before the day of the alleged killings ? " " I was at home . " " Did you have any visitors that evening ? " " I did . " " Name them . " " Jud Clasby , accompanied by Hannah Cape . " " Why were they there ? " " Jud Clasby was seeing Hannah home from a visit she had made to the Woods . Our house is between the Wood home and the Capes ' . " " So the call was just a social one ? "  | " For Hannah , it was . " " For Clasby ? " " He was sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you mean by sounding you out ' ? " " He asked me if I did n't think the Indians at the sugar camp ought to be cleared out . " " What did he mean by cleared out ' ? " " Killed . " " Did he say so in so many words ? " " I do n't remember his exact words . That was his meaning . " " What was your answer ? " " My answer was that I was finished with that sort of thing . " " What do you mean , that sort of thing ' ? " " Killing Indians . " " You had killed Indians before ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " To save my life . " " Always in self-defense ? " " Not always . Sometimes because they were Indians . We were pardners , Clasby and me , hunting and trapping out west . It do n't make sense to wait for a dangerous animal to attack you . " " That 's how you considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west when I was younger  --  yes . Since I came here , I 've been converted . I 've become a Christian . But even the Bible do n't say that if somebody is going to die , you 've got to choose yourself to be the victim . It does say , Do n't kill . ' I told Clasby I was n't going to kill Indians for using a sugar camp and trapping a creek they 'd trapped along for years before we ever showed up here . " " Did anyone hear this conversation ? " " My wife . And Hannah Cape . " " What happened next ? " " Clasby and Hannah left . My wife and I went to bed . " " Did you see Jud Clasby again ? " " Mr. Armitage , " Bemis replied , " it 's my intention to answer every question you can think of to ask . It would maybe save time if I 'd tell the court what I did and you ask questions only when you think I 'm leaving out something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll stop you when it seems necessary . Now , when did you see Jud Clasby again ? " At this point , the chief defense counsel got to his feet.  | " Judge McGowan , " he said , in a voice accustomed to being harkenedto , " may I address a question to the witness ? " Judge McGowan , a man who ruled in his own courtroom , neverthelessharkened . " Address your question , Counselor . " " Luther Bemis , first of all , may I remind you that you are under oath to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " " You do n't need to remind me of that , " Bemis answered . " I ai n't forgetting it for a single minute . What do you think I 'm up here for ? " " That 's exactly what I 'm trying to get at . Did you talk over with Mr. Armitage what you have just said ? " " I did . " " And what you plan to testify to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Mr. Armitage promise you that if you gave testimony helpful to the prosecution in this case , he would see to it that your sentence was light ? " Luther Bemis 's hand instinctively went to his belt , where ordinarily he carried a knife . " That 's a damn lie , and you know it . " Judge McGowan 's gavel startled Bemis , and the courtroom , which was immediately in an uproar at this exchange , went into silence . " Mr. Bemis , " the Judge said , " may I remind you that you will be held in contempt of court if there is any more profanity . The defense counsel is trying to help you to recognize the fact and try to co-operate with him . " " Judge McGowan , " Bemis said , " no man is trying to help me who stands in the way of my telling the truth . " Still belligerent , he glared at his own counsel . Caleb Cape rose . " Judge McGowan , " he called out . Caleb was well enough known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding , except for the experience of men like McGowan , by guess and by gosh anyway . " Pastor Cape . " " I am not an ordained minister . " " Mr. Cape . " " I have testimony that might be useful to the court if they care to hear it . " " Step down , Mr. Bemis . Mr. Fenton , call up the witness . " Duly sworn , Caleb said , " Before Luther Bemis ever saw Mr. Armitage , he came to me with the account he now wishes to give to the court . My advice to him was to seek out Mr. Armitage , the statep130prosecutor , and to tell him what he had told me . It was Mr. Bemis who sought out Mr. Armitage . Not the other way around . No deal for special treatment was made . " " Mr. Cape , " asked McGowan , " why did n't you advise Mr. Bemis to make his report to the defense lawyers ? " " I did n't think the defense lawyers wanted to hear what Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was on my advice Bemis went to Armitage . For the sake of his own soul , I may add . " After this interruption , Judge McGowan ordered the questioning of Bemis by Armitage to continue . " Mr. Bemis , " Armitage asked , " may I now repeat my earlier question ? When did you next see Jud Clasby ? " " After he visited our house with Hannah Cape ? " " That is right . " " Jud Clasby came to our house around nine or ten o'clock the next morning . He said that his horses were missing  --  strayed , stolen , no telling which . Would I come with him and any others he could roust out to look for them ? Well , there was no question about my doing that . I told my wife good-bye and set out with Clasby . Told her I might not be home before nightfall . " " I reckon you took your gun with you ? " Armitage asked . Fort was on his feet at once . " Judge McGowan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth . What Mr. Armitage reckons ' and what Mr. Bemis did are two separate matters . Let Mr. Armitage reckon ' all he wants . But let him put direct questions to the witness . Not make suggestions . " " Objection sustained , " said McGowan . " Mr. Prosecutor , question the witness directly . " Armitage , with a great show of being obliging , rephrased his question . " Did you take a gun with you , Mr. Bemis ? " " I did , " answered Bemis . " Why ? " asked Armitage . Fort was again on his feet . " I object . By asking Why ? ' Mr. Armitagewould like to lead the jury to believe that Mr. Bemis went with malice aforethought , armed for the purpose of killing Indians . Mr. Armitage may live in the capital of this great state of Indiana , but he knows as well as I do , and as every man on the jury does also , that no man up here and in his right senses goes five hundred feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said McGowan.  |p131Armitage  repeated his question , " Why the gun , Mr. Bemis ? " " Habit , mostly , " said Bemis . " And good sense . " " Where did you go after leaving the house ? " " We went toward the shack where Jud Clasby has been living since he came back here . On the way he showed me two small piles of corn . You do n't usually find piles of corn out in the woods far from any barn lot . I wondered about them . Clasby said he figured they had been put there by the Indians to toll the horses away from his place . " " Did you see any tracks around the corn ? " " Yes , I did . Horse and moccasin tracks . At the time , I thought the horse tracks were Clasby 's and the moccasin tracks Indians ' . I think now I was tricked . " " Why ? How ? " " I was tricked by somebody 's putting that corn there and seeing that some horses come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil at Indian thievery  --  and it did boil . There 's nothing lower than a horse thief  --  but my only thought then was to get the horses back to Clasby . Clasby said , Let 's go to the sugar camp and see if the horses are there . ' That was agreeable to me , the only reasonable thing to do . " Before we started out , Clasby asked me into his shack . He got out a bottle and took a pull on it himself . Then he handed it to me . When I was converted , I gave up drink . I 'm not myself when drinking . I do things and afterward I do n't know why I done them . But Clasby and me were old friends and we 've emptied many a bottle together . I thought maybe going without it for so long had settled me down so drink would n't work on me the way it had when I was younger . I was wrong . If anything , it worked on me harder . I was drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Woods , and the Cape boy came along . " " Did these men have guns ? " " All but the Cape boy . He was just traipsing along because young Wood is his friend . " " Did they drink ? " " Benson and old Wood had a pull , but by that time the supply was about finished . " " What happened next ? " " We went to the sugar camp . It was agreed that the two Woods , Benson , and the Cape boy would stay in camp with the women and children , while me and Jud Clasby , with the help of the two Indian bucks , went to hunt for the horses . "  |p132If  you thought the Indians had stolen the horses , what made you think they 'd lead you to them ? " " We did n't think that . If they stole them , they 'd lead us as far away from them as possible . They 'd lay down a cold track . " " What was the idea of taking them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Whose plan was this ? " " Clasby 's . But I went along with it . I was took in by the corn and the tracks . And by the whiskey . I was thinking the way I did when I was Clasby 's pardner out west and every redskin was our enemy . I was ready to kill then ! I thought I 'd be saving our own lives in the long run . That 's what I thought . " " What happened when you got to the sugar camp ? " " First of all , the Indian squaws gave us food . They always do . It sobered me up some , but not enough to bring me to my senses . Clasby did n't mention to the Indians what he 'd told me  --  horses stolen . What he said to them was horses strayed . ' Would the two men help us look for them ? Tall Tree did n't think much of this plan . He said , How do you know but maybe if I go , I shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , White man has had more practice with guns than the red man . ' " Tall Tree did n't argue about this . More practice , ' he agreed . But red man shoot faster . ' " Red Cloud , a leader among the Indians and a man very open and friendly to whites , said he 'd be glad to help . " Red Cloud went with me , Tall Tree with Clasby . Clasby had told me what he would do and what he wanted me to do . When I heard the sound of his gun , it would be a signal that he had killed Tall Tree , and that I was to kill Red Cloud . " " Did n't you have any compunction about going ahead with this plan ? " " Compunction ? " " Second thoughts ? Twinges of conscience ? " " I did , yes . But by now I was bound by an agreement . I 'd told Clasby what I 'd do , and I 've never been a man to back down once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better to kill a man than to break your word to a man who 'd fooled you into murder . " " I did n't know I 'd been fooled then . And I was drunk . " At this point Fort again interrupted . " Judge McGowan , may I put a question to the witness ? "  | " This is irregular , " replied McGowan , " but with the prosecutor 's permission , I 'll grant you your request . " Mr. Armitage , a man who knew he had nothing to lose , granted the permission . " Mr. Bemis , " said Fort , " you keep telling us you were drunk . But you also keep remembering like a man cold sober . You remember what Clasby said . You remember what the squaws fed you . My belief , Mr. Bemis , is that a man as drunk as you say you were could not remember such small happenings . My belief , however , is that you were indeed as drunk as you say you were . I know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn liquor can do for you . I believe that you were just as drunk as you claim . But that what you are now passing off as what you remembered are items you 've let Mr. Armitage , for reasons best known to you and Armitage , persuade you to present as remembered . ' Is n't that true , Mr. Bemis ? Mr. Armitage 's not your lawyer , Mr. Bemis . Do n't you know that ? Are you still drunk ? Do n't you know what Mr. Armitage has in mind for you ? " " I know what Mr. Armitage has in mind for me , " Bemis answered , steady as a rock . " That 's his business . My business is to tell the truth . Armitage did n't tell me a thing to say . He listened to me . That 's all he did . It may be I 've made out I was drunker than I was just to ease my conscience . I would n't say that 'd be past me . Even now . " Armitage , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any more questions you 'd like to ask the witness , Mr. Fort ? " Fort bowed out of the exchange with all of the poise he couldmuster . " Thank you , Mr. Prosecutor . For the time being , that is all . " Armitage then continued from the point where he 'd been interrupted by Fort . " My question was , Mr. Bemis , did you think it better to kill than to break your word to a man who had fooled you into murder ? And your answer was that you did n't know then that you had been fooled . And that you were also drunk . Is that still your answer ? " " It is . " " You still say that at that time you believed a man 's life was of less account than your word to a murderer ? " " Nobody up to then had ever called Clasby a murderer . And he was my pardner . And just how drunk I was , I do n't know , but I was drunk , and keeping my word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I done . " " How did you persuade this Indian , who had no reason to trust ap134white man , to go off with you on a trumped-up search for horses that were n't lost ? " " I told you Red Cloud was goodhearted and friendly to whites . I did n't have to do any persuading . He went along just as helpful as if he 'd been looking for his own horse . " " You know who 's in this courtroom listening to your words ? " " I 'm looking straight at them . I 'm confessing to them as much as to anybody . More to them than anybody except God . I confess to them both the wrong I did . " " An honest confession may set you right with God . But the Indians want more than that . You understand that , do you , Mr. Bemis ? " " I understand that . " Judge McGowan decided to get Armitage and Bemis back on the track of the trial proper , which was : Who killed Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is good for the soul , be it to man or God . But this trial will last from July to eternity if it 's opened up to all the confessions that might be , and maybe ought to be , made here . But this is , however , a circuit court , and I got dates elsewhere and soon . Mr. Armitage , let 's get on with what the witness did after he left the camp with Red Cloud . " Armitage then said , " Mr. Bemis , you have heard Judge McGowan . " " Well , after we left the camp , I let Red Cloud range on up ahead of me , making excuses myself for little side trips so I 'd always keep him in front of me . He was about thirty steps ahead of me when I heard a shot from the direction Clasby and Tall Tree had gone . " A shot from Clasby was the signal for me to finish off Red Cloud . Red Cloud turned at the sound of the shot toward me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shot went clear through him , and blood spurted out front and back . I wish to God I could forget Red Cloud 's look . He could n't believe I 'd done it . He was helping me and I shot him . He said , You kill me ? ' " " Well , what did you say to that , Mr. Bemis ? " " I did n't say a word . What could I say ? I 'm saying it now . I hope Red Cloud can hear me . " Bemis , who up to this point had spoken without much emotion , buried his face in his hands . What he had to say from behind his hands was too muffled to be clearly heard . Judge McGowan said , " Take your hands down , Mr. Bemis . We ca n't hear you . " Lawyer Armitage had n't become state prosecutor by being a man who did n't press an advantage when it was given him.  | " I ca n't vouch for what Red Cloud can hear , Mr. Bemis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am listening very carefully . " " Mr. Bemis , " McGowan said , " you asked for this chance to speak . It 's out of order for you to do so , and we have interrupted the usual order of things to let you do so . Now you 'll have to take your hands down so that we can hear what you are saying . Otherwise you can step down . " Bemis straightened up at once . His eyes were dry as sandstones . His supply of tears had long since been used up . " I ask the court 's pardon , " he said . " What came next ai n't easy to tell . I walked toward Red Cloud , who was still standing . I do n't know how . Blood was leaving his body by the bucketful . As I came near him , Red Cloud said , If you shoot me again , shoot me through the head . ' By the time I reached him , he had sunk to the ground , but was sitting upright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was making a sound . A sound anyway was coming from him . It was n't a moan or a scream . It seemed more like something inside him broken and running down . You know the whirr a grindstone makes when you stop pumping ? Red Cloud just sat there , bolt upright , making that sound . And dying like an Indian . I 've seen them die before . Many 's the time . They do n't whimper . They do n't beg for mercy . Red Cloud opened his mouth just enough to let two words out . Finish me . ' I took my knife from my belt , and Red Cloud nodded . His eyes were wide open and he was asking me to do what I done . There was no wrong in that . It was the first shot that was wrong . " " What was it you did ? " Armitage asked . " I cut his throat . " " And he thanked you for it ? " " He did . He thanked me with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here . I want to say Red Cloud done no wrong . That I killed him while drunk , and that he died like a brave man . " " Why have you made this confession ? " McGowan asked . " Were you coerced by the prosecution ? " " I made it to get some peace with God and my soul . " There had n't been a sound in the courtroom during Bemis 's confession . The listeners held their breaths as much as if they 'd been out there in the woods watching the whole affair  --  the tracking , the gunshot , the blood , the knife at the throat , more blood , the closing eyes . Armitage asked Judge McGowan if , in view of Bemis 's full confessionand of his expressed desire to share the jail with those alreadyp136accused and indicted , the formality of a grand jury indictment for him might be overlooked . Before Judge McGowan could agree or disagree , Charlie Fort was on his feet . " May I cross-examine the witness ? " Judge McGowan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Bemis , but turned aside enough so that the courtroom could see Bemis 's face . " Mr. Bemis , " he said , " have you any witness who can substantiate the truth of what you 've just said ? " Bemis , who had sunk back into a kind of torpor after the ordeal of the confession , appeared not to take in the import of what he 'd been asked . Fort reworded his question . " Did anyone see you do what you claim to have done ? " This question struck those in the courtroom as ridiculous . Did a man who confessed killing have to produce witnesses before his word would be taken ? Fort did n't give the rustle of what was the beginning of a nervous titter a chance to break out into a laugh . " There have been numerous cases of confessions of crimes by men who never committed them . In Clinton County , Ohio , two years ago , a man confessed to the murder of his wife who had disappeared . By virtue of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang when his wife turned up alive . " Armitage interrupted Charlie without a by-your-leave from the judge . " Counselor Fort , if Red Cloud turns up alive , I 'll gladly accept your argument that Mr. Bemis did not kill him . " The onlookers did laugh at that . But Charlie Fort was too nimblewittednot to have foreseen such a rejoinder from Armitage . " Mr. Prosecutor , " he said , " I had addressed a question to the witness . Will you be so kind as to let him testify ? You , " he said to Armitage , " will be given ample time for your own comments later . Mr. Bemis , were there any witnesses to this act ? " Bemis answered , " Besides Red Cloud , you mean ? " This answer appeared to astound even Fort . He answered very gently , as if to a sick man . " Yes , I mean besides Red Cloud . " Bemis shook his head . " The two of us were alone . Just me and Red Cloud . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked me to do that . " " If the court will have a little more patience with me , I wouldp137like to cite another Ohio case . This was in Bartholomew County , where a man testified to a killing he did not commit . " Judge McGowan was getting impatient . " We 're not overly interesteddown here in miscarriages of justice in Ohio . " " You 're interested in justice , Judge . This case has bearing on that . A man in Ohio assumed the blame for a killing there because of a debt he felt he owed a friend . I submit to this court that Luther Bemis , admittedly drunk at the time of the shooting , does not know but that Clasby killed Red Cloud . He admits that he did what Clasby told him to do . What proof is there that he is not now saying what Clasby told him to say ? " Before this unthought-of possibility had time to sink fully into the minds of those in the courtroom , Ora Bemis , pushing past the knees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes . That 's what happened . That 's what happened , Mr. Fort . Lute told me . He said he had to tell it the way he has ; Jud Clasby saved his life once out west . Now he wants to take the blame off dud 's shoulders for the killing of Red Cloud . " Ora , unwieldy with the child she was carrying , went on to where her husband sat , dropped to her knees and looked up into his face . " Tell them , Lute , you did n't do it . Tell them what you told me . You lied for Jud 's sake . " Luther Bemis did n't say a word . He bent forward , put his cheek against Ora 's , and stroked her hair . It was a hard scene to interrupt , but Armitage did so . He had not built his career as prosecutor on softheartedness . " Judge McGowan , may I call the court 's attention to the fact that Mr. Fort , by placing the blame for the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of murder from Bemis . He is not suggesting , is he , that Clasby murdered both Red Cloud and Tall Tree ? All he has done is to prey on the feelings of an overwrought wife , insult the intelligence of this jury , and harm the case of his client . " Fort , Caleb Cape , and Bemis , who had also risen , began to speak together . Judge McGowan , an old hand at outbreaks in rural courtrooms , gaveled them all into silence . It was already well past the noon hour . Food was overdue and might settle tempers and restore a little reason . " The court is adjourned for two hours for dinner , " he said.  |p138The  day after Bemis 's confession was Thursday . Judge McGowan was down again with another bout of his intermittent fever . At McGowan'srequest , and because they had no wish to stumble through this tangled legal forest without an experienced guide , both side judges moved to postpone the trial until the next morning . That Thursday had an unreal feeling to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt about it . The postponement heightened this sense of bewilderment and , during the morning , a stunned silence lay over Pendleton . But by midafternoon some of the shock had worn off and the town began to chatter like a family facing a new , unexpected problem . Charlie Fort had prevailed upon his landlady to provide a little supper for him and Hannah Cape that evening . " Norry , " he said ( Mrs. Culligan 's name was Norah , but Charlie had long since left " Mrs. Culligan " behind and called her by the name used by her neighbors ) , " I know you 're not running a boardinghouse and that you only took me in out of the kindness of your heart . But I wonder if you could give me and Hannah Cape a little supper to-night ? " " As you said , Charlie , I 'm not running a boardinghouse . " " It 's this way , Norry . What with her family and that raft of cousinsthey 're staying with here in town , to say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she now has O. A. Dilk pawing around her like an ox . . . . " " Like a bull , " Norry corrected him . That was a word Charlie , who had been brought up not to name male animals before ladies , would not repeat , though he recognized the greater accuracy of Norry 's description . " Pawing , ' anyway , " he agreed . " Well , with all this going on , about my only chance to talk to Hannah alone is here . Or take her out for a little walk in the woods . " " Plenty are traipsing off for just that purpose . "  | " Do n't think I do n't know that . That 's why I thought it 'd be a lot nicer here . " " It would be , " Norry said . For her , too , Norry thought . She was a woman of good sense as well as passion . Her good sense did n't deny the passion but provided ways , when it was possible , for bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to cook a supper that she and Charlie could eat alone together . That being out of the question , why deny herself the pleasure of hearing Charlie laugh and talk , of seeing him throw back his long silky cowlick and stretch out his long strongthighedlegs . Say no to him about this supper and he would traipse off to the woods with that big redhead . Who would be the gainer by that ? In her own day , when she was dark and sparkling , Charlie would never have given that big redhead a second glance . Well , that day had passed . No one , to her knowledge , had learned how to turn back the clocks . Turn them ahead and make Charlie her age ? That was n't what she wanted , either . What she wanted was the girl she had been to be with the young man Charlie was . That girl was alive inside her , a sleeping beauty now to others , but wide awake to herself . That girl did n't need any kiss to wake her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake another . " You courting this girl , Charlie ? " " I have n't asked her to marry me , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's what I mean . " " I 've only known her two weeks and talked to her three times . I do n't want to scare her to death . " " I guarantee you wo n't scare her . What would you like for supper ? " What they had for supper Charlie did n't know . The table was set pretty , not in the kitchen , where Norry ate , but in the sitting room in front of a nice little slow-burning fire of oakwood in the grate . The table was the one Norry used at night to play patience on and in the daytime for rolling out pastry and cutting up pieplant in the kitchen . It was covered with a tablecloth and decorated with a little jug filled with the first Johnny-jump-ups of spring . There was n't a restaurant in Cincinnati that could 've providedthem with a turnout any more stylish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud . She was n't a preacher 's daughter fornothing . She knew how to talk to strangers , was accustomed to put/ting them at their ease . She admired the table , smelled the flowers , helped Norry bring the food from the kitchen . When the supper was on the table , Norry said , " Now there 's more where this came from . You help yourselves . I 've promised to go sit with old Sam Randall for a spell tonight . He 's down with lung fever and his poor wife has n't had any rest for a week . Now make yourselvesat home . If I ai n't back before you leave , Hannah , I 'm pleased to have met you . " Norry shut two doors firmly between her and the young couple and went down the path toward the Randalls ' . If she could n't be happy with Charlie , she could at least be happy with herself . She had done the right thing . Cleared out . Done unto others as she would be done by . Die a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two doors closed , Charlie and Hannah , mov-1 ing slowly , as if carried by a wave or by the wind , went into each other 's arms . They fit there . They felt an ache each had endured since the last clasping disappeared . They did not need to kiss , or want to . That was too special . It denied the all-overness of the pressure of cheeks and arms and thighs . They were not ready yet for anything so concentrated as a kiss . It was enough to have the feel of each other 's names in their mouths . " Charlie , Charlie . " " Hannah , Hannah . " Such beautiful sounds . They could n't get their fill of those words . They delighted their mouths with them . After a time they remembered the table . " What 're we going to do with all this food , Hannah ? " Hannah , practical as well as lovesick , her stomach growling with hunger , said , " It would hurt Mrs. Culligan 's feelings to leave it un-touched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could not unclasp hands . Hannah 's throat , though her stomach was hungry , felt swollen . Food went down painfully . She gave up trying to swallow and watched Charlie . He had been talking all day , going over the case with his fellow lawyers . He ate , but slowly , as if he , too , found it a task ; he swallowed like a man taking a dose of medicine . " Oh , Charlie , " she said . " Yes , Hannah ? " She wanted to say , " My darling love , you are so beautiful . I will never be separated from you all the days of my life . " But he had n't said , " I love you , " yet . A woman who said that first could drive ap141man off with her forwardness . The game was hide-and-seek , and it was the woman 's place to hide and the man 's to seek . Otherwise , no game . She said , " I thought what you said yesterday about Luther Bemis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were about the only one . " " Ora Bemis thought it was good . " " Do you think it 's true ? " " No . " " Neither do I. But that jury needs to be given some doubts . Otherwisethey 'll decide to string up those fellows just to save their own necks . " " They would n't do that . " " What do you think that row of Indians is standing back there for ? " " To let them see we are keeping our word . Having a trial the way we said we would . " " There is another reason . Do n't think Colonel Johnston does n't want everyone to have a good look at the customers the Pendleton and Fall Creek folks might have to deal with if the murderers are n't hanged . " " Hanged ? They would n't hang poor Johnny Wood , would they ? " " If he 's found guilty , that 's what Johnston expects . But I 've got a trick or two up my sleeve yet . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was asked if he 'd vote guilty ' just to stave off an Indian attack . " " Would anybody admit to that ? " " I do n't know . But they ought to have been asked . And the fact they were n't might be grounds for charging a mistrial . " " What 's a mistrial ? " Charlie put down his fork , took both Hannah 's hands in his , and groaned , " My God , I 've lost my mind . Mistrial ! Miss Cape is the only miss I care anything about . I 've talked to lawyers for so many days I 've forgotten there 's anything but Indians and trials and murderersin the whole state of Indiana . I did n't ask you to have supper with me for any more talk like that . " " What kind of talk ? " Hannah asked , so bold her eardrums pounded with blood . Charlie closed his eyes and laughed . Then he opened them wide . " You want me to say it ? " " I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you . " " I love you , Charlie Fort . " They leaned across the table , ready to kiss now . Charlie 's cuff dragged in the gravy bowl . " We 've got to get rid of this damned table , " Charlie said . Hannah 's startled look reminded Charlie that he was talking to a preacher 's daughter . He would n't get fined for every damn and hell he said here , but his stock would n't go up any with her , either . " I did n't mean the cuss word , " he said . " I told you I was out of my mind . Let 's get rid of the table and some of the food . We do n't want Norry to think we ate so little after all the trouble she took . You help me carry the table to the kitchen and we 'll give the leftovers to the dog . " When they came back from the kitchen , they stood in the center of the sitting room like actors waiting for a cue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on would be different . Charlie had some familiarity with the next lines , but Hannah was tongue-tied . She expected " Marry me " next , to which she would instantly say " Yes , " go home and start plucking geese for feather beds and hemming linen for sheets . Charlie said , " You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen . " This was n't a proposal , but it was perhaps the kind of talk that should come before a proposal , like grace before a meal . It made Hannah even more tongue-tied and self-conscious . She hid her face against Charlie 's shoulder  --  he was tall enough so she could do that . The minute she did so , she did n't care about proposals . Or anyone speaking , she or Charlie . Her body spoke , " Touch me , touch me , touch me , " and Charlie 's body heard and answered . They were strong enough for kissing now , and kissing was strong enough for a time . But what their lips felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norry Culligan came home at the decent hour of ten . First into the kitchen , then opening the door into the sitting room  --  which was also her bedroom . There in front of the fire , built up enough to shed some light as well as heat , naked as jaybirds , lay Hannah Cape and Charlie Fort , sound asleep and fondly entwined . Norry stared for a time , then quietly closed the door to the kitchen . What did you expect , she wondered . Then she went further : What did you want ? She sat down at the table where the two had eaten , and cried . Tom , she thought , though in her thinking she was talkingp143to Tom , the husband of her youth , not thinking of the Torn dead and in his grave , and she the old widow . It was you and me I saw there . Do n't think me a silly old woman . I 'll never do anything to shame you , Tom . I 'm your true wife ' til they lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't stopped feeling . If I was the one who had gone , and you the one who had stayed , you would 've remarriedlong before this . But no one asked me , Tom . No one I 'd have , after you . No old sack of bones like Mr. Wood . Charlie 's the spit and image of you the first day I saw you . I wo n't shame you and I wo n't make a nuisance of myself to Charlie . You can count on me , but I ca n't help crying . Norry put her head on the table and cried a big wet splotch of tears that quickly spread on the white linen tablecloth . Then she got up . Those two must put their clothes on and Charlie must get Hannah back to her home . She took the poor cat out of its nighttime crib in the woodbox , and set him on the step . " Run for your life , Goldie , " she said . Scooter could never catch the big tom , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . If that did n't arouse the young people , she 'd clatter around in the kitchen until she did it herself . Goldie ran , Scooter after her , baying . Norry went behind the springhouse , out of sight from the house , and leaned there until she heard the house door close . She watched the young people , arms around each other , move off quickly under the light of a moon growingtoward its full . Inside the house she went to bed , leaving a night light burning on the stand table by the door that led to the attic room  --  as she always did when Charlie came in after her bedtime . She went to sleep at once . The light was gone when sometime later she awakened and turned over . Upstairs at his table , Charlie blessed old Scooter , still prowling around growling at cats , he imagined , and at real raccoons and polecats , likely . Except for that dog , he and Hannah would have been still lying there on the floor when Norry came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came looking for her . That would have been a pretty howdy-do . Well , pretty , all right , depending on who looked at them ; but a howdy-do for certain . With Scooter 's help they were up , dressed , and out of the house with no one the wiser . Charlie was of two states of mind at the same time , and each state was the absolute opposite of the other : so happy and keyed up , sleepp144might never again be necessary ; so filled with lassitude and near to sleep , if he closed his eyes it might be a few days before he opened them again . Go to sleep and dream for two or three days ; dream that that long naked body , pink and gold in the fire glow , never once left his side . He went to the washstand , poured the bowl full of water and doused his head in it . He had his weekly letter to write for the Spy  --  and yesterday 's happenings were real news , not storytelling about strange doings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any indictment by the grand jury , and without any witness to the truth of what he was saying , simply because he was determined to go to jail , was a far step from a jury trial as they knew it in Cincinnati . He recounted the factual happenings of the day before  --  not of this night  --  to his father . Then he could not resist a lapse into commentary . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : If there are no further interruptions of the kind experienced yesterday , the trial of George Benson will at last begin tomorrow . Benson , before he had any idea that he would be brought to trial for killing an Indian , boasted at a public meeting of his part in the killings . The two Woods were with him at the time , but both the Wood men and Benson have , since the trial began , refused to speak of the part played by the others in the affair . So we have the peculiar circumstancesof three men in jail because they themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fourth now there because he feels he has committed a crime . And thus far , unless the men start accusing each other , there are no witnesses to the killings they claim they committed . It is a trial based upon circumstantial evidence . No one saw the crimes committed , and the accused are jailed on say-so only , albeit their own . It is also constitutionally questionable whether the court can , after two hundred years of recognizing the necessity of killing Indians in order to survive , suddenly reverse itself and declaresuch killing to be a crime . Another circumstance , having to do with the trial but not with its constitutionality , is the presence of Black Antler , the Indian teacher of the boy Folded Leaf , who was killed . Black Antler is what the Indians call a prophet , a follower of the famous Handsome Lake . Black Antler preaches and teaches Handsome Lake 's doctrines . One of these was that no one should be put to death for any crime . HandsomeLake was a Seneca from Pennsylvania who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-fifths Indian and one/fifth Quaker . Either alone is hard to swallow , and the combination sticks in most throats . Particularly when Black Antler argues that Colonel Johnston is wrong when he says that the men who killed the Indians must , if found guilty , be hanged . When Black Antler , a Seneca , which of all the tribes has been the most revengeful and bloody , argues against the hanging of men who killed his own people , the Fall Creek folks do n't see anything in his argument but a plot : a plot to provide the northern tribes , if Johnston and Calhoun 's promise for strict justice is ignored , an excuse to swoop down on the settlements here , ravage , burn , and kill . Here is this old Indian arguing for mercy for the accused while even the families of the accused think he 's likely scheming to provide an excuse for his kinsmen to kill them all . Black Antler preaching charity , while half or more here think Johnston , preaching hanging , is on the right track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they can catch Clasby , and save the lives of the hundred or more an Indian uprising would be sure to wipe out . There are others who argue that the thing to do is to get a detachmentof army regulars in here , march north with them , and put an end once and for all to the Indian menace in this area . It 's going to have to be done sooner or later , they say ; better do it now , before the red man strikes first . With Calhoun heading up the Department of War and Johnston in charge of Indian Affairs for the Northwest Territory , it 's unlikely the government will send soldiers to put down a rising of Indians  --  who have n't risen  --  Indians who , to boot , have as an excuse for doing so  --  the murder of their kinsmen . This community is split down the middle in its opinion as to what should be done . Half think that Johnston was right in promising the Indians a trial of the killers and punishment under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been made and that the Indians should have been dealt with as they always have been before , with force . It sometimes appears that there will never be any need for another Indian raid on Fall Creek . Neighbor will have fallen upon neighbor and by the time the redskins arrive their erstwhile settlement will be extinct as the result of civil war . Two families , unable to face the prospect of watching friends condemnedas murderers  --  or , if this is n't done , of being themselves killed  --  have already pulled out . And more are threatening to leave . More guns are being carried here now and more prayers being saidp146than at any time since Pendleton was founded . The combination may seem odd . But they represent the debate going on in men 's minds : What is the right thing to do ? What is the safe thing ? Pendleton does n't know the answer to these questions . Pa , I wish I could talk over this trial with you . The job ahead of me is n't easy . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the last may be impossible. 1 . Recall to the minds of the jurors what settlers have suffered at the hands of the Indians. 2 . Bear down hard on the fact that these men had been brought up to believe that killing an Indian served a better purpose than killinga deer. 3 . Root out , if I can , somebody who will testify that these Indians by some word or act posed a real threat to the community . I 'm up against tough opposition . Armitage , the state prosecutor , is hard as nails and with a mind like a bear trap . O. A. Dilk , his assistant , is young , ambitious , and wily . I think he sees winning this trial as his first step toward the Presidency . The senator hides his experience and determination behind a mask of urbanity . But he did n't come out to this little backwoods town to lose , that 's certain . Well , you better pray for Charlie , Pa . Also , you better prepare to meet a Hoosier daughter-in-law before too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Hannah . But you did n't advise me to stop seeing her  --  and I 'm following your advice there , too . End of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . Charlie had outlasted his bout of sleepiness . What he would like to do now was get into bed with Hannah , sleep with his face tangled up in that mane of her long bright hair . But Hannah was over there at her cousins ' , the Baldwins , sleeping , no doubt , on a pallet in the loft with a half-dozen girl cousins tucked in around her . He undressed in front of the opened window . The moon had set and there was only one light to be seen  --  the light in the window of the old man Norry had been sitting with , perhaps dying at this very minute of his lung fever . Charlie could see the jail , merely a dark outline , of course . You did n't go to jail with any expectation of being able to stay up all night playing seven-up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had talked himself into it . If I was ever so crazy as to kill a man , Charlie thought , I 'd keepp147my mouth shut . But perhaps confession was a part of the craziness : kill and tell . He did n't expect to sleep . Thinking about what had happened only made him crazy to have it happen again . He envied Norry , calmlysleeping , undisturbed by any thoughts of lovemaking . There were some advantages to being a woman , especially a woman of a grandmother'sage . He was asleep before the feather bed had completed its enfoldingmovements.  |p148On  Friday , Judge McGowan was still down with fever . Side Judge Giddings 's wife was having a baby , their first after eleven years of marriage ; he moved that the trial be postponed until Monday . Side Judge Oursley , the blacksmith , was more than willing for the postponement . Every horse in the township would be running barefoot if he did n't get in some licks soon . The defense lawyers were especiallyglad for the break . Bemis 's confession had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , together with Ora Bemis , left Pendleton Friday morning when the news of the second postponement was announced . Ora would n't ride in the same buckboard with Caleb . Exceptfor Caleb 's meddling with Lute 's life , Lute would n't be in jail now , and she alone . Ben and Hannah drove Ora home in the rig the Bemises had driven over to Pendleton . They would spend the night with her , Ben doing the barn work that the Riggins boy , only twelve , had no doubt had to scamp ; Hannah doing housework and keeping Ora company . Ora was within a month of her time , and what she had had to go through in the past few days might speed things up . Ora did n't hold Caleb Cape 's making a Christian out of her husbandagainst his children . If Caleb 's teachings had caused Lute to make a confession that would do no one any good , she did n't suppose Caleb 's children were able to get off scot free in their life with their father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot handier and neater in kitchen and bedroom than any man Ora had ever known . First she got Ora undressed and into bed ; a few minutes later she had a fire going , a kettle on the crane , corn dodgers mixed , and side meat frying . After supper , Hannah sent Ben , who clamored for a game of jackstrawsor checkers , up to bed . " You 've got a big day ahead of you , Ben , first with the work here ,  |p149then  over helping Pa . You stay up late tonight , and I wo n't be able to roust you out of bed ' til way after sunup . " After Ben had gone , Hannah pulled a stool to Ora 's bedside . " Is there anything more I can do , Ora ? " " Bring Lute home , " Ora said . " I do n't think he 'll be away long . " " What makes you think so ? " " I was talking to Mr. Fort , the defense lawyer . " " If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort could get this case dismissed out of hand if he wanted to . " " He is a very good lawyer . " " Maybe . That do n't stop him from being a ladies ' man . " " You think he 's a masher ? " " Maybe not . But when a man 's as good looking as Charlie Fort , women ca n't keep their hands off him . And men being like they are , Charlie Fort ca n't help liking that . " " Do n't it make any difference to them who the woman is ? " " Oh , sure , it makes some difference . Men think so , or theywould n't settle down and marry one woman instead of another . " " Did Lute ever love anybody besides you ? " " Hannah , Lute left home when he was seventeen . I never laid eyes on him until he was twenty-six . He was out west , a lot of the time with Clasby . " " Is Clasby a masher ? " " He is . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch him settling down with any one woman . He and Lute both had Indian wives . More than one . " " How could they have more than one ? " " They just called them wives . They were n't really married by any preacher . " " But they acted . . . like they were married ? " " They acted like it . ' " " Did they have babies ? " " Of course . " " Did Lute tell you ? " " Yes . " " Did you want him to ? " " I knew it anyway . . . from people 's talk . " " Do you think he might go off and have another wife , after you ? " " No , I do n't . What your pa did , converting Lute , makes him thinkit 's wrong to have more than one wife . Besides , he 's older now . Hep150likes staying in one place now and having a home and a baby . " " How soon did your baby start to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . " " They do n't come right away then ? " " There seems to be a rule . If you do n't want one , it comes quick as a wink . If you do , you sometimes wait for years . Look at Judge Giddings and his wife . Took them eleven years . " " That 's not the rule , though . " " There 's no rules , in spite of what I said . It 's all hapchance , and I think God Himself keeps pretty clear of such matters and lets men and women work such things out as best they can . " " Do n't you think God cares whether men and women act like they 're married , when they 're not ? " " He may care . But I do n't think He thinks He can do much about it . " " Are n't you a Christian , Ora ? " " Of course I 'm a Christian . That do n't mean I blame God for everything that goes on in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lute into a state of mind where he thinks God wants him to confess every bad deed he 's ever done . " Ora sighed . " I never thought I 'd be able to sleep on a night like this  --  Lute in prison laying on straw . But I 'm dead beat . I could sleep on straw myself  --  and I wish I was  --  beside Lute . But I 'll sleep anyway  --  if the baby 'll consent to do the same . He 's kicking like a bay steer now . Want to feel him ? " " No , " Hannah said . " No , I do n't . " " Bank the fire , then , and come to bed . " " I could sleep on a pallet on the floor and not bother you . " " You wo n't bother me . An empty bed 's what 'll bother me . This is the first night but one I 've been separated from Lute since we were married . You know what it feels like sleeping alone when you ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your coffin . Cold and alone . Cold and alone forevermore . That 's what I fear . " " Mr. Fort says Lute wo n't be gone long . " " You like to talk about Mr. Fort , do n't you , Hannah ? As much as I like to talk about Lute . " " He 's trying to help Lute and Johnny Wood and the others . I have to admire him for that . " " Me , too , " Ora said . " I admire him for that . Let 's try to sleep now . " Ora did , sighing and moaning as she slept . Hannah could n't . Shep151got out of bed carefully and noiselessly walked in her bare feet up and down the room . She knelt and prayed . " God forgive me " was what she intended to pray . " God , I thank Thee " was the way the prayer came out . O. A. Dilk arrived at the Bemis cabin at ten the next morning . The horse he was riding was warm but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of him , Pendleton to Fall Creek and back , and he was a man who believed that haste makes waste . Hannah answered his knock . He wanted to talk with Ben but he would be pleased to have the talk include Hannah also . For a young girl , Hannah looked stately , better turned out at ten on a weekday morning than many a cabin woman at four on Sunday afternoon . She knew , and he was glad to see it , that appearances counted in this world . She immediately protected Ora Bemis , for which Dilk was glad . Mrs. Bemis could not be expected to look kindly on a lawyer who was trying to get her husband convicted of murder . " Mrs. Bemis is feeling poorly , " Hannah said . " She is in bed . She ca n't see visitors . " " I 'm sorry to hear she is indisposed , " Dilk said . " Yesterday must have been a very trying day for her . " Hannah thought , He talks like a lawyer no matter where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing two-faced about such a man . " I did n't come to see Mrs. Bemis . I came to see Ben . And you , too , if you 'll join us . " " Ben 's down at the barn , cleaning out the stable . " " It 's such a nice spring day . Is n't there some place out of doors where we could talk ? I do n't want to upset Mrs. Bemis any more than I have to . " " Has something more come up about Lute ? " " Nothing more about Lute . You can tell his wife that he said this morning that he 'd had two of the best nights ' rest since the shooting . He feels he 's clear with God and ready to render unto Caesar what is Caesar 's . " " I do n't know 's that 's a message she 'd like to hear . She spent the night mourning for him . " " You use your own judgment about what you tell her . I 'm going down to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when I talk to him . He puts a lot of store in what you say . " Hannah went back in the house to get her sunbonnet . The sunp152was n't hot but it was bright and she freckled easily ; and she was gettingtoo old to enjoy being called " turkey egg . " Dilk fetched Ben from the barn , and they used the upended chunks , sawed but not yet split , at the woodpile for seats . The sun brought out the sweet wood smell of the freshly cut oak . Redbud and dogwood were beginning to froth out along the edge of the woods . Frogs down in the branch were tuning up for tadpole time . They could hear the gravelly riffle of the water as it broke clear of the bank at the bend . It was the weather and the place for a picnic , Hannah thought . The biggest stump of all should be covered with a fringed tablecloth ; fried chicken , light bread , and a sour-cream sweet cake should be set out on it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing . There were no fireworks about Mr. Dilk . He was steady and thoughtful . Pleasant as a basket of chips , her mother would say . Nor did he have that mortal sweetness that makes folks keep their distancefor fear of a heart scald they 'd never get over . He let the trial he 'd come to talk about ride easy for a while . " Mr. Dilk , " Hannah began . " Call me Oscar , " Dilk interrupted her . " I heard you did n't like that name . " " I do n't like it . And when I come to run for Congress , it 'll be a drawback . Some Thomas or Josiah will beat me out because people 'll think those names sound more dependable . But it 's my name and I 'm not running for anything just now . " " But that 's what you plan ? " Hannah asked . " To begin with , yes . Congress . But I 'm not campaigning now . And neither of you can vote anyway . So let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get to Congress , I can be Mr. Congressman ' to you if you want . " " What 'll I be then ? " Hannah asked , filled with an exciting boldnessshe had never known before . " Well , I 'll wager one thing , " Dilk said . " Not Miss Hannah Cape , I 'll vouch for that . " Am I flirting , Hannah wondered . How could that be ? Be too intimate with a man one day , and the next start flirting with another man . The answer to that was love . She loved and was loved . That made her happy and happiness made her loving toward everyone ; not afraid to flirt , because nothing hinged on flirting now ; it was a play-party game , fun but no more important than weevily-wheat or **25;2002;TOOLONG . What she and Charlie had done wasp153wrong , and they would never do it again . But in the life ahead of her they would be married , and it would n't be wrong any longer . And even now it was very strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of grace ; as if she had gone to a protracted meeting and been sanctified . She was just a moon reflecting Charlie 's warmth onto this anvil-hard Congressman-to-be . Ben seemed as much changed as a boy as she was as a girl , and with nothing more to help him than some sensible talk with O. A. Dilk . To Ben , Oscar must seem just as reliable as any Tom or Josiah . He was going to do whatever Oscar wanted . She could tell . Testify in court as to what he had seen , if Oscar thought that right . " I 'm not saying it 'll be easy , " Oscar told him . " I am saying it 'll be simple . Just tell what you saw . It 's your duty to do it and you 'll feel better afterward . If they cross-examine you . . . " " What 's cross-examine ? " Ben asked . " It 's what the defense lawyers may do . After you 've told your story they may try to mix you up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to mix me up ? Do n't they want to know the truth ? " " Not if what happened makes their clients more likely to be con-victed . " " Well , they ca n't mix me up , " Ben said . " I know what I saw and heard . If they ask me questions , I 'll tell it all over again just the same way . They 'll get sick and tired of hearing me . " " They 'll be sick , all right , " Oscar said , " when they hear what you have to say . " " It 's what I did makes me sick . " " Tell it , " Oscar said , " and get it out of your system . It 'll be like having a boil lanced . Get the pus out of your system , and you 'll mend fast . " " I 'm going to , " Ben said resolutely . " I 'm going to tell it all . My part , too . "  |p154Court  resumed on Monday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the prisoners ' pen . Ordinarily a florid , heavy-set man , he was noticeably thinner and paler . Sitting over there in the straw in the jail , cussing and sweating and fuming , had worn him down . He was still cussing and sweating and fuming , but there was noticeably less of Benson for the job . The Indians , if they found the proceedings tedious , gave no sign of it . Unaccustomed to sitting on benches and chairs , unable to see what went on if they sat cross-legged on the floor , after their custom , they stood . The row of them , straight , motionless , seemingly untiring , attracted about as much attention as the proceedings up front . No one forgot them . Or forgot why they were there . No one was able to attend continuously to the oratory of the lawyers or the testimony of witnesses without turning to see how the Indians were taking it . Had one crumpled , leaned against the wall , sat down ? No , there they stood , a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unafraid , waiting to see the justice they had been promised done . The courtroom was even more crowded than it had been on Wednesday . Bemis 's confession had whetted the appetites of all . Was there more to come ? The shooting of two bucks in the open was not as compelling as the slaughter of women and children at the sugar camp . Who had done that ? The two Wood men and Benson had boasted earlier in open meeting that they were responsible for the killing . This was before there was any hint of trial or jail . What they had expected was praise . Varmints wiped out . Thieves of the settlement'sfish and game taught a lesson . The settlement owed them thanks . There were some in the courtroom who still felt that way . Those who had lost relatives at the hands of Indians were shedding no tears over the deaths at the sugar camp . It would give them pleasure to hear exactly what had happened , and what had happened they hoped included suffering as well as death . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakingp155feeling , of which they were n't proud , of wanting to hear the worst . Their throats were dry . They could n't look their children in the eye . O. A. Dille , as assistant to Armitage , wasted no time in asking Ben Cape , the preacher 's son , to come to the witness stand . This caused a gasp in the courtroom . Caleb Cape had had a hand in getting Bemis to confess . Was the preacher going to get his comeuppance now ? Hear a confession squeezed out of his own son by the prosecutor ? Dilk handled young Cape as tenderly as a china dish . He all but lifted and carried the big lunk of a boy to the witness stand . Moved his own lips in the swearing in as if to show the boy anybody could do it . Once he got under way the boy did n't need any more help than a sledder going downhill on glazed ice . Dilk kept slowing him down so that there would n't be any cracks in his testimony into which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to go to the sugar camp on the afternoon in question , Benjamin ? " Dilk asked . Did the fact that Dilk did n't like his own name give him a delicacy in his use of the names of others ? So not " Ben , " but the full dignity of the Biblical name ? " Johnny Wood came by our house with a gun . I thought he was going squirrel-hunting . He 's my best friend . My sister  --  " " We 're not interested in your sister , Benjamin . Now go on . What happened next ? " " I asked Johnny if I could go with him and he said I could . But Pa would n't let me take a gun . " " Why not ? " " Saturday afternoon is getting close to Sunday , and Pa thinks that on Saturday afternoon you should n't go frolicking . " " Does he think squirrel-hunting frolicking ' ? " " It 's lots of fun , " Ben said , as if agreeing with his father . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just to watch and pick up squirrels for him . Not to do any shooting . " " Did you pick up any squirrels ? " " No . Johnny did n't shoot any . " " Why ? " " He was in a hurry to meet his father and uncle . " " George Benson and Wood Sr. ? " " Yes , sir . " " Where ? "  | " At the Indian sugar camp . " " Were these men glad to have you with them ? " " No . Old Mr. Wood wanted to send me home . But Johnny 's Uncle George said , Let him stay . It will do him good . " " Did he say what it was that would do you good ? " " No , sir . " " Who was at the sugar camp ? " " Besides the Woods and George Benson ? " " Yes . " " The Indians . Three women and four children . One was my friend Folded Leaf . I was learning Indian gospel with him from Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father feel about your memorizing Indian gospel , Benjamin ? " " He said that what Black Antler preached was about what he preached . Except the names was different . " " Can you remember any of the words you memorized ? " Ben said , " I know by heart lots that Black Antler preached . " " Just a few lines will do , " Dilk told him . " Black Antler said , Our land will decay if we do not think on the Great Spirit . We must renew our minds and think on the Great Being who made us all . Then when we put our seeds in the Earth , they will grow and increase like the leaves on our trees . If any man , whatever he may be , will look on the Great Being above us all and do his will on Earth , when his days are out and the spirits about find he is a good man they will grant him more days to live in the World , and if he lives a good man , doing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Great Being will take him to himself . The like ofthis . . Charlie Fort , on his feet at once , his resonant tenor bugling his protest , addressed Judge McGowan . " Your honor , I protest . What is this , a court of law or a camp meeting to convert whites to the religionof the Senecas ? My understanding was that we were here to try the case of George Benson , indicted by the grand jury for murder . Now if the Great Spirit had a hand in this , I will listen to his testimony . Is the prosecution prepared to produce the Great Spirit ? " There were hoots of laughter , the soft thumping of moccasined feet , the high-jinx shouts of play parties and cornhuskings . Before Judge McGowan could say a word , or even gavel for silence , there was a carrying sound from the back of the room : the ominous hoot-owl call of one Indian signaling to another . This si/lenced the courtroom faster than any crack of wooden gavel on wooden table . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to give a command twice , the words , " Let the boy speak . " All turned toward the speaker . Dilk , who had not expected supportfrom this quarter , and was n't sure he wanted it , said , " What was that ? " All , now looking to the back of the room , saw the largest , most richly dressed , likely the oldest of the Indians take one step forward . He repeated what he had said . Not more loudly , though perhaps more slowly , " Let the boy speak . " Fort , undaunted , ignored the Indian and said , " Your honor , the boy 's testimony does not require any further recitation of the doctrine of Handsome Lake as preached by Black Antler . These doctrines have absolutely no bearing on the case we are considering . Further talk about them simply wastes the court 's time . We have already been forced to listen . .. " Judge McGowan did not permit Charlie Fort to finish his sentence . " Objection overruled , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners , red or white , to dictate courtroom proceedings . But this case was not customary in any way . Better , McGowan believed , to permit jurymen and onlookersalike to believe that the chief 's request was not unusual . Let the judge lead the jury , by some rebuke to the chief , to believe that the red men were out of order and those twelve jurymen , all with side knives , would be at the back of the room with such speed and fury as might make the sugar-camp massacre a Sunday-school picnic . " Let the boy continue , " McGowan said , as if the order had originatedwith him . " Continue , Benjamin , " Dilk said , as calmly as if the idea had been , from the beginning , his . Ben , rattled by the interruptions , made a couple of false starts , reconsidered , and finally got under way again . Black Antler taught us , Never forget to be thankful to the Great Spirit above us all . We will be good friends here and when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happier days . " Ben looked apologetically at his Indian listeners . " I know more , but right now I ca n't seem to remember . The way we always did it , Folded Leaf would say it with me . He knew it better'n me and I could follow him when I forgot something . " At the back of the room the chief who had spoken made the Indian sign " We are satisfied . "  | " Continue with the boy 's testimony , " McGowan ordered . Benjamin , " Dilk said , " why did you think Benson and the Woods went to the Indian camp ? " " To visit them . " " This is something you have done before ? " " Yes . " " What happened to the squirrel hunt ? " " I thought we would hunt after we ate . " " They fed you ? " " Indians always do . " " Did everybody eat ? " " Yes . " " What happened next ? " " We just talked around for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . . . ' til we heard the shots . " " What shots ? Where ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't remember . " Ben dropped his face into the cradle of his arms . At the back of the room one of the younger Indians spoke . " You tell , boy . " Dilk turned his anvil face toward the Indians . " He is going to tell . You wo n't help him by yelling at him . " The Indian who had first spoken , the tall , richly beaded and featheredchief , made a sign of rebuke to the younger Indian . " The boy tells well . Let him take his own gait . " " Benjamin , " Dilk said , " was the first shot from toward the river or away from it ? " Ben looked up , puzzlement on his face . " The first shot was toward the river . " " Then . . . ? " " Then a single shot from the other direction . " " After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then they started doing it . " " Doing what ? " " I told you . Killing . They all started killing the Indians . They started shooting . As soon as the other shooting stopped , they started shooting the women and children . " " Who did the killing ? " " They all did it . " " Did you see anybody in particular ? "  | " I saw two . First of all I saw what Johnny Wood did . " Charlie Fort was on his feet . " Judge McGowan , I protest . We are now considering the case of George Benson . If the boy has any testimonyrelevant to the actions of George Benson on the afternoon in question , let him continue . If not , let him step down . " " Your honor , " Dilk spoke harshly , " this court will have to make up its mind whether it wants to hear the gentleman from Ohio spiel or whether it wants to hear from an eyewitness an account of what actually happened . I ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the horrifying events of the afternoon . .. " Charlie Fort was once again on his feet , his tenor voice high and carrying after Dilk 's bass . " Your honor , I object . The prosecutor is prejudicing the minds of the jury by using words to characterize the acts of the men I defend ; and no testimony has yet been produced to justify such language . " " Objection sustained , " said Judge McGowan . " I withdraw the word , your honor . But I do ask you to remember that the witness is young . He is unaccustomed to being questioned about a . . . " Dilk paused dramatically . " A disturbing event . " He paused again , giving Fort his opportunity to argue that what had happened at the sugar camp was not " disturbing . " Fort remained silent . Dilk continued . " As I said , the boy is young and the events he witnesseddid not happen in any order or sequence which Mr. Fort may feel most suited to the defense 's case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will , I assure you , Mr. Fort , get to Mr. Benson . And when John Wood , Jr. , is tried for the act for which he has already been indicted by the grand jury , my witness will then repeat for the jury what he saw , in case the jury feels the need to hear that act described once more . But I beg of you , Judge McGowan , out of consideration for the feelings of the boy and out of a judicial concern for the most complete account possible of the events of that day that you permit the witness to tell the court of the happeningsin the order that they happened . " " Permission granted , Mr. Dilk . Continue with your witness . " " Benjamin , " Dilk said , " you have told us that after you heard the shots fired away from the camp , shooting then began at the camp . You also said that you can only say positively who was responsible for two deaths ? Is that true ? " " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you witnessed and who was the killer ? "  | " When the shooting started , two squaws fell down right away . Everybody thought they were dead . But one of the squaws was n't dead , because they brought her to church at our house the next day . She died then . " " You said there were three Indian women . " " Yes , sir . " " Did you know the other one 's name ? " " Yes , sir . Her name was Wide Eyes . " " Was n't she hit ? " " Not at first . George Benson told Johnny he was leaving her for him because she was younger than the other women . " " Had n't Johnny done any shooting ? " " No . He had n't lifted his gun . When Mr. Benson said , What are you waiting for , Johnny ? , ' Wide Eyes said , I am a Christian . The Lord Jesus Christ is my savior . Do n't shoot me . I love the Lord Jesus Christ . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . Let her have it . ' Then Wide Eyes tore open the front of her dress so that all of her skin down to her waist showed . And she was as white as we are . And she said , Brothers , my skin is white as yours . ' And it was . But Mr. Benson said , She 's a breed , Johnny . Her father forced a white woman . Whose side are you on , anyway ? ' Then Johnny raised his gun and fired . It hit one side of her chest  --  right in the center . But she just stood there , and not even any blood came out . So Mr. Bensonsaid , She 's got one more , Johnny . You got one bull's-eye . One more will do it . ' So Johnny shot her again  --  in the same place  --  on the other side . She went down to her knees like she was going to say her prayers and she said , I love the Lord Jesus Christ . ' Then she fell on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny raised up his gun and ran over to Mr. Benson . " " To shoot him ? " " No . The gun was n't loaded then . To hit him . " " What did Mr. Benson do ? " " He took hold of the gun , and Johnny held on , and Mr. Benson threw Johnny to the ground . " " Did he hurt him ? " " I do n't know . Stuff came out of Johnny 's mouth , but it was puke , not blood . " Ben leaned over , his face in his hands again . Dilk said quietly , " So all the Indians were then dead ? " There was no response from Ben.  |p161Dilk  repeated somewhat more loudly , " So all the Indians were then dead ? " Ben shook his head . " Not all . " " We ca n't hear you , Benjamin . " Judge McGowan said , " Mr. Dilk , your witness will have to speak up . This is not a private conversation between you and the boy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . " Ben sat up with a jerk . His eyes were red-rimmed and his round cheeks glazed with tears . " Hang me , " he said . " Did you kill anyone , Benjamin ? " asked Dilk . " It would 've been better if I had . " " You did not kill anyone . Who did ? " Ben stood up and pointed at Benson . " He did . " " Sit down , Benjamin , " Dilk said . " You have already told us that both Benson and Wood Sr. fired at the women and children and that with the exception of Wide Eyes , who was killed by Wood Jr. , and of Talking Crow , who died next day at your house , everyone was dead when the firing ceased . Have I misunderstood you ? " " Everyone looked dead . " " But everyone was n't ? " " No , sir . " " Who was alive ? " " Folded Leaf . He was alive . " Having said these words , Ben stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alive . He was alive . " Then he bolted from the witness stand and appeared to be headed for the door , the street , and the woods beyond . As he passed the bench where the Cape familysat , Caleb Cape shot out an arm and pulled his son down onto the seat Caleb had vacated . The crowd murmured , but the disturbance was not loud enough to require Judge McGowan 's gavel . If Ben had been seated next to Hannah , he might have buried his face on her shoulder and cried . He was next to his father , and crying on his father 's shoulder was an act he was n't encouraged to perform in private , let alone public . So he leaned forward , head to his knees , and rocked soundlessly , tearlessly , backward and forward . He heard Dilk say , " The court will understand and excuse the witness 's very natural emotional upset . Give him a few minutes to recover and we will continue . "  |p162Ben  felt his father 's arm across his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben , " his father whispered , " this is a big test for you . The biggest and the hardest you 've had yet . You got through this . Now you do what you ought to do here  --  tell the truth  --  and things will likely smooth out for you from here on . It do n't matter what people think  --  or what you think they 'll think  --  you just set your jaw and tell the truth . This ai n't between you and them  --  the people out there . It 's between you and Folded Leaf and God . And me . You 're my son . I set some store in you  --  and what you got the backbone to do . Telling the truth , no matter how much you wish it could be different , will clean the slate . It 'll make everybody who loves you proud . " Caleb had murmured these words in a voice so low Ben hardly knew whether it was his father or his own mind speaking to him . Maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what had happened . He did n't have to rock any more . The pain in his chest had let loose of him so that he could sit up straight and take notice of where he was . Dilk said , " Is the witness ready to resume his testimony ? " Ben felt the weight of his father 's arm lifted from his shoulders . He stood . He said , " I am ready . " His voice had a strange cracked sound in his ears , so he repeated the words to make sure they carried . " I am ready . " It still was n't the voice he was accustomed to , but it carried . Dilk said , " Please take your seat , and we 'll resume where we left off . " Ben reseated himself . " The witness has already been sworn , " Dilk said . " The question , Benjamin , was that though everyone looked dead , everyone was n't dead . Do you remember that ? " " Yes , " said Ben . " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive ? " " Folded Leaf . He was alive . He 'd been shot in the leg and was stunned . But when Wide Eyes was shot , he sat up and tried to crawl to her . He could n't because his leg was shot and the bone was stickingout . Bone is white like chalk , Mr. Dilk . " " That is a fact , Benjamin . Then what happened ? " " Mr. Benson yelled , The damned little bastard is alive ! ' " " There are ladies present , Benjamin . " " Do you want me to tell what happened ? " " Everything that has bearing on the trial . Bad language has no . .. "  | " I 'm keeping back most of the bad language . There was lots more than I 've told . " " Thank you , Benjamin . When Mr. Benson saw that Folded Leaf was still alive , what did he do ? " " After the cussing ? " " After the cussing . " " He shot at Folded Leaf but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Folded Leaf called to me , Help me , Ben . Help me , Ben . ' When he called I ran ahead of Mr. Benson toward Folded Leaf . But Mr. Benson caught me by the arm and said , Preacher 's boy , if you do n't want the same medicine I 'm going to give that redskin '  --  he cussed some more  --  ' stay out of here . ' " " Did he hurt you ? " " He did n't hurt me bad . I could 've stood it . He slung me down . But what he did was scare me . His eyes were popping out and spit ran out of his mouth . " Then Folded Leaf called again . Help me , Ben . ' But I did n't run to him . " " Why ? " Dilk asked . " I was afraid of Mr. Benson . When I got halfway up , he turned back toward me and lifted his foot like he was going to kick my teeth out or kick me somewhere . " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of his mouth , got to his feet . He had been brought into the courtroom ironed , and the chains rattled as he stamped his feet . " That 's a lie , that 's a lie , " he bellowed . " I was trying to save the boy . The redskin was crawling toward him . Ben , you know that 's a lie . It was your safety I was thinking of . I pushed you to save you . " Judge McGowan saved Ben the need to reply . " Mr. Benson , " he said , " sit down and be quiet or I will instruct the sheriff to remove you. , , Benson sat down , but he kept talking . " The boy is lying , Judge . He never did like me . I run him off our place once . " " Sheriff , " McGowan said , " will you remove the prisoner ? " Benson stopped speaking . " Mr. Benson , " McGowan said , " you will be given all the time necessary to tell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two witnesses at once . Now , Mr. Dilk , if you will have your witness continue . I trust we 'll have no more interruptions . " Dilk said , " Benjamin , will you tell us what happened next ? " " I did n't go to help Folded Leaf . I was afraid to . "  | " What did Mr. Benson do ? " Ben put his head in his hands again . Dilk took hold of Ben 's shoulder . " Mr. Benson was right , was n't he ? Folded Leaf tried to kill you . " Ben jerked upright . " He did n't , he did n't . I told you , he could n't move . His leg was shot in two . When Mr. Benson saw he had me buffaloed , he walked over to Folded Leaf . And Folded Leaf said once more , Help me , Ben . ' But I did n't move . Then Mr. Benson picked Folded Leaf up by the heels and swung him around in a circle so that he fetched his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a big beech . Then he swung him the other direction and did the same thing . " " Did this kill the boy ? " " He did n't have any head left . Mr. Benson smashed his head like an egg . There was a body left , and running down the body was blood and stuff like pus and more little white bones . You could n't tell if the body was a boy or a girl . Or if it was an animal , except for the clothes . " " What did Mr. Benson do then ? " " He threw what was left of Folded Leaf away . Like hog guts . Then he pulled up some grass and wiped his hands on it . Then he said , I reckon that finishes the job . ' " " What did you do then ? " " When he said that , I got up and run . " " Where did you run to ? " " I was heading home . But I was sick a lot of times and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more shots back at the sugar camp ? " " I could n't hear anything for a long time but Folded Leaf 's head breaking open against the beech tree . And I could hear him ask me to help him . I still can . And I remembered how quiet he was when Mr. Benson picked him up . He did n't beg Mr. Benson . Or ask me any more to help . He knew what was going to happen to him , but he did n't make a sound . But his head made a sound . His head made a sound like . . . " Judge McGowan said , " We have heard that before . You do n't need to repeat it . " " No , you have n't heard it , Judge McGowan . You did n't hear it . You do n't know what it sounds like . Not the head of somebody who asked you for help . Not the head of . . . " " Ask your witness to step down , Counselor. "  |p165Dilk  put his arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then led him back to where his family sat . The courtroom was silent . No one moved . Judge McGowan stared out at the crowd . They had come to see the monkey show . Well , they had seen it . He thought he could hear heartbeats ; he certainly heard hard breathing . He certainly heard Ben Cape crying and George Bensonmuttering away low enough not to be told to stop , but loud enough to prove no judge could shut him up . Would the crowd sit there silent all day ? Did they want to hear more of the same ? He gaveled to wake them up . " The court will adjourn for two hours for dinner . " There was one door . The prisoner , his wife and six children troopingbehind him , was taken out first . The Cape boy 's account had taken some of the feistiness out of him , but he was far from broken . A white man in chains and Indian bucks parading like peacocks . Bensonwas rolling a mouthful of spit around like a cow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach . He carried it as far as the door and loosed it like a hot cannonball on the new spring grass . Judge McGowan watched him go . Benson would pass through that door someday hearing dreadful words he had spoken . God in heaven , God of mercy , why did he ever become a judge ? The jury followed . They would find guilty or not guilty : Sanders , Johns , Roberts , Gunn , Stephenson , Smith , Bentley , Wilson , Kilburn , Morley , Marsh , Fielding . They had listened to something they could not forget . What wrong had that Indian boy done besides being born red ? Guilt or innocence was their responsibility . Life or death was his . He wanted to put his face as low in his hands as that boy had , hearingagain a head break open with the sound of a pumpkin busted for cattle food , and cry . He wanted to , but he was a man , not a boy , and a judge , to boot ; which is hardly a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features as impassive , he hoped , as the Indians he faced . The lawyers , talking , but quiet for lawyers , left together  --  except for Dilk , who went out with the Cape family . Mrs. Wood , enjoying herself , wife and mother of stars in the play , went out in a prance . The onlookers left . The trial was many things to them . Most important , human beings instead of trees . Orators battling . A contest between lawyers , with words flying like bullets . The listeners all had real bullets , could make them or buy them . But none of them had ap166lawyer 's store of words to fight with . Blood had been shed and more might flow . The onlookers filed out like fever patients from a hospital , their faces heated and their eyes bright . Judge McGowan had seen this happen time and time again . Considering the vein of cruelty that pulsed in all men , the love of violence , the fascination with death , it was a wonder so few heads were broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe the Indians were any different in nature from the white men  --  in spite of Handsome Lake 's prophecies and Black Antler 's teaching . They , too , were brutal , but their training was different . Their faces were not open books . The Indian boy had not cried out . His kinsmen had not uttered a sound as they listened to the manner of the boy 's death . They left the courtroom , their faces as sealed as old tree butts around the living sap that fed them . Judge McGowan envied them . When the side judges and Fenton , the clerk , had left the room and he was alone , he did what he had wanted to do before : he put his arms on the table in front of him and his head in his arms . He was not a young man , not old either  --  thirty-eight . There were strands of white in his brass-colored hair , like a dandelion getting ready to go to seed . He was not ambitious , like Fort and Dilk . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was another kettle of fish . Judicious in practice required that one man , sitting on a bench , Amos McGowan , in his case , declare that in the name of justice one man should die , another serve ten years at hard labor , a third go free . There were hairlines here too fine for the human eye ( which was all Judge Amos McGowan had ) to see . A hand on his shoulder roused him . " Amos , I hope I did n't wake you up . " It was Johnston , the Indian agent . " I was n't asleep . " " Will you come eat dinner with me ? " " Thank you , Colonel . I do n't feel like eating . My stomach turns at the very thought . " " That was n't a very pretty story . " " I 've heard worse . " " I reckon you have . " " There are times I think I should never have been a judge . " " You 've built up a fine reputation all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . Happiness neither . " " This sort of thing makes us all bilious . "  | " There 's nothing wrong with my liver . I 've got a troubled mind . No one man can hand out justice the way a judge is asked to . " " No one man is asked to , Amos . Behind you is a grand jury that indicts . A petit jury finds guilty or innocent . All a judge is asked to do is to sentence . " " It shapes up that easy to you ? " " Besides the juries , you 've got a framework of law and of court practice almost a hundred years old to support you . " " Court practice for the past hundred years wo n't help me in this case . You know as well as I do no court has ever handed down a judgment against a white for killing an Indian . " " Do n't you think it 's about time ? We 've got enough treaties with the Senecas to roll up and make a corduroy road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at war with them . Do n't you think it 's about time the law recognized them as human beings , under the law ? " " Oh , it 's time , all right , Colonel . God knows it 's time . We know it 's time . But did the men who did the killing know it was time ? For two hundred years it was time to kill Indians . How was Benson and the Woods to know the time had come to stop ? " " Something told Bemis . It 's a lesson the others can learn in this courtroom . " " All right , string ' em up . What use to a man with a broken neck will that lesson be ? " " Their sons will learn the lesson . The Indians will learn . " " What lesson will the Indians learn ? " " They 'll learn there 's justice for them , too . They 'll learn they do n't have to raid and scalp and burn to get it . " " You admit they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , Amos , where do you think I 've been for the past fifty years ? " " There 's those who wonder . " " There 's no need to wonder . I been right here . Born here . Living in Ohio state . Watching the Indians get the dirty end of the stick for fifty years . It 's time they got justice . " " Colonel , there 's no such thing as justice . There 's chance . It wo n't be justice that hangs these men . If they hang . It 'll be chance . The chance that put an Indian agent like you in the Northwest Territoryat the time of the killings . It wo n't be justice that saves them . It 'll be the chance of a judge who wonders how settlers can know that time has had a turnabout ; that justice , who has had her blinders offp168and her eyes wide open to see who was red and who was white , has put them back on again ; that 's what may set them free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? " " I pray they can , sometimes . In God 's name , I pray it , Colonel . " " Leaving justice out of it , Amos , you know what this trial can meanin the matter of saving lives ? " " Oh , I know that , and do n't you remind me of it . This court , while I preside , wo n't be run on the principle of providing victims to appeaseattackers . We 're not savages . I 'd rather we 'd all be wiped out together than have any man who was n't found guilty by the jury sentenced by the judge to appease the Indians and save our own necks . " Judge Amos McGowan slumped against the headrest of the tall fan-backed chair brought in from somebody 's parlor for the trial . He looked up at the chunky Colonel . The Colonel 's decision had been made from the minute he heard of the killings . Get the killers hanged . With this promise made to the tribes ( time and chance and justice all bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian uprising and had brought the chiefs to Pendleton to see with their own eyes that his promise was being kept . Behind the Colonel , backing him up , stood the Secretary of War , Calhoun . And behind Calhoun stood Monroe , the President . And both were providing money to transportIndians , fee lawyers , pay the expenses of witnesses . What did he have ? McGowan asked himself . The law and his conscience . And the terrible knowledge that all courts up to this time had ignored the law . And that Benson , the Woods , and Bemis had killed out of knowledge of this fact . " Come on out and have some dinner with me , " Johnston urged again . " It 'll do you good . " McGowan shook his head . " I think I 'll go out to the backhouse and have a good puke , " he said . " That 's the slant my stomach is takingright now . "  |p169Charlie  Fort did n't feel like eating , either . He did n't know what anyonecould have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the long run it did n't make much difference how a man died . He was dead  --  shot in the guts , a blow on the head . But a boy with his skull bashed open sounded worse to a jury . There was n't any law providing clemency for tidy killers , but a jury , a judge , too , were inclined to find a savage killer guilty faster than one who had n't bloodiedup the landscape . Charlie had a revelation or two of his own to make , and this afternoon , when he put Benson on the stand , if he could keep the big fireeaterfrom rattling his chains and threatening to brain someone , he might undo some of the harm of the morning 's testimony . It was June in April . No June flowers or leaves yet , of course , but June 's breath , warm and sweet as a midsummer day . It happened thus sometimes , a few days stolen from summer before summer 's time , as there were a few summer days hoarded to be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . A day like this one , less certain in coming , had no name . It was less heartbreaking , too , since it was n't a farewell to what would be a long time absent , but a welcome to what was just around the corner . Charlie had two hours before he had to be in court . He headed toward the woods ; out of the village , past blacksmith , tavern , and the newly made jail , past the Baldwin house , where the Cape family was staying  --  all sitting outside on stumps and benches eating a cold picnic dinner . Dilk was with them there , acting cosy as a member of the family . And Ben , still solemn , was able to handle a drumstick . Hannahwas there , handing out the victuals , her back to him . When she turned and saw him , he felt in his own veins the impulse he knew was in hers to do away with all distance between them . Jump stumps , turn over rocking chairs , send bowls of coleslaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilk a clout on the head in the process . What was Dilk doing there , anyway ? He had been sent to Pendleton to prosecute , not spark.  |p170Yet  Charlie was able to greet them all like a lawyer , not a lover . Congratulate Dilk . Tell Ben that he had done the right thing ( he had , though Charlie wished he had kept his mouth shut ) . Not say Hannah 's name at all until his mouth was clear of all the others . " Have you eaten yet ? " Caleb Cape asked . " We 've got God 's plenty here . Join us . " " I thought I 'd walk out in the woods . There 's a number of things I 'd better think over before court this afternoon . The prosecution has put the defense on its mettle . " Lizzie Cape said , " Hannah , fix the poor man a piece of chicken and bread and butter . You can think while you eat , ca n't you , Mr. Fort ? " " Think better , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run without hay , " said Caleb . " Nor the bird fly without seed . " Hannah brought him bread , chicken , and a square of sweet cake wrapped in a fringed red-and-white-checkered napkin . " If you do n't mind , Mrs. Cape , " Charlie said , " I 'll take Hannah with me to listen to me practice my afternoon plea . " Dilk said , " Pleading 's not going to change facts , Charlie . " " The facts are maybe less one-sided than you think , Oscar . " Charlie was talking over his shoulder as he headed himself and Hannah toward the woods . When the trees shielded them from sight , he threw the contents of the napkin away . " Fly away , little chicken , " he said . He put the napkin in his pocket and took Hannah in his arms . " My God , my God , Hannah , where have you been ? " " You must not curse , Charlie . " " I 'm praying , Hannah . I 'm praying , Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long again . " " Do you know how long I 've been away ? Only three days . " " Does it seem that short to you ? " " No , " said Hannah . " It seems forever . " They moved two steps forward , deeper into the woods , then kissed ; two more steps , then kissed again . Hannah was more breathlessthan after an uphill run . She was weak in the knees . In the midst of her tremors and gasping she was still able to look at Charlie and to think , Oh , Charlie , you 're nothing but a sweet-looking love-making man . You 're not an angel from Heaven but a lawyer from Cincinnati . Then it came to her that she would n't care to be in the woods with an angel from Heaven . She would feel out of face with an angel ; with Charlie she was more at home than at home . Hugging Ben was sweet.  |p171Waiting  on her father and mother gave her heart-ease . But Charlie , outlining her eyebrow with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain . Her heart ached . It was a pain : but a pain that only more pain could cure . They said that of some diseases : she 'd have to feel worse before she could feel better . The roots of a giant sycamore , spread out like the fingers of a hand , offered them hammocklike depressions . " Let 's sit down and rest , " said Charlie . Rest was the last thing she needed . Climb the tree , maybe . Chop it down . But not sink down into one of those root spaces , more a palletthan a chair . She had already decided how it would be possible to see and talk to Charlie without encountering the danger of what had already happened once : always stand up . She was no ignorant backwoods girl who thought that babies were delivered by storks . She knew where they came from and how . Her talks with Ora had taught her even more . She had no intention of having a wood 's colt , or of being pitied because of a watermelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving Charlie , no way she could stop daydreaming about him , or of living over and over again what had happened at Mrs. Culligan 's . There was no harm in that . Babies were n't daydreamed into happening . Babies came from lying on your back and letting a man plant his baby-seed in you . When she and Charlie were married , as they surely would be , and when Charlie was finished with the trial , they could spend whole nights , and days , too , if they wanted , in bed and never worry about babies . The more babies the better . Now , no matter how she felt , she would always , when with Charlie , stay on her feet . Always . Hug , kiss , fondle , taste , smell . Hands did n't get babies , nor did lips , or eyes , or noses . They were made in another way and came from another place . Touch , as long as she stood on her feet , as much as she wanted to . Feel the silky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , the Adam 's apple outthrust but not bony ; the flat strong back ; the curve of the back before it lifted into the muscled bottom ; the inside of the mouth clean and sweet ; the outward curve of the inside of his thighs , firm as plow handles . Loving of this kind , touching of this kind , was not wrong , because as soon as the trial was over they would be married . They had n't talked of this yet , but they would as soon as Charlie had time to think of something else besides the defense of his clients . And it was allp172right because she would always stand on her feet , upright , firm as a soldier who knows his duty . Lying down was when the trouble began . " My God , Hannah , " Charlie said , " what are you doing ? " " I am loving you . " " Now I am going to love you , Hannah , " Charlie said . He did n't ask her . He told her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she folded up like a jackknife . She went down and Charlie with her , between the sycamore 's outspread fingers into a nest of leaves left over from fall . She remembered , " Always stand up . " But they were nothing but words now , and words had no power to get her up onto her feet . She could say , " No , no , no , " but very faintly . Charlie was no fool . He knew , and Hannah knew , that anyone who really meant " no , no , no " could get up and run . He had n't hit her on the head with a stone or put an armlock on her . All he did was do what he 'd done before : plant that watermelon seed , breed that wood 's colt . That was all he did . And she lay there as happy as if planting and breeding were the world 's whole purpose , and nowhere forbidden , not by Bible or preachers or parents . Because he was tired , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to make his own defense of Benson the subject of his piece to the Western Spy . He had some reservations about doing this . Readers might think that vanity had prompted him to embellish the written report with eloquence and wisdom he had not displayed in the courtroom . The conclusion might be natural . The fact was that he could not remember all that he had been able , in the heat of the courtroom conflict , to say in George Benson 's defense . Most readers of the Spy knew that he was the adopted son of the editor . They would for this reason be more interested in his report of his own actions than in the report of another journalist . And they would know also that the editor of the Spy would expect his son to lean over backward in avoiding any representation of himself as shrewd or eloquent beyond the facts . Up to the facts he was prepared to go . Mrs. Culligan , when he came in after the late-afternoon adjournmentof the court , had seen that he was tired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look tuckered out . Let me fix you some supper . It 'll save you a trip to the tavern . "  |p173Feeding  Mr. Fort was no part of her obligations as his landlady , but she assumed it with pleasure . " You go on upstairs and catch a few winks while I dish up . I 've got an A-1 stew . I 'm adding dumplings . As soon as they 're done , I 'll bring you up a tray . Then you can write with one hand and eat with the other . " He could n't quite do that ; but he did sleep , and the stew with dumplings steadied the pen in his hand and the brains in his head . He wrote of himself in the third person . It made the task of writing more objective , he believed ; and it would certainly read more impersonally . " I did this " and " I did that " might all be true as a die . But the reader , hit in the face with all those I 's , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit is due , does n't he ? " So he wrote of Charlie Fort as lawyer observed , not reporting . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : On Monday morning , the trial in Pendleton of the four men accusedof murder in what is being called the " Fall Creek Massacre " resumed , with Judge Amos McGowan on the bench . The morning session was given over to the testimony of a fourteenyear-oldboy , produced by the prosecution as a witness to the part played by George Benson in the so-called massacre . Benson was being tried for the death of one of the squaws , but Judge McGowan permitted the prosecution to interrogate the Cape boy about the death of one of the Indian children . In the afternoon , when court resumed , the original order of business was restored : Benson was then tried for the first crime for which he had been indicted . Before putting Benson on the stand , Charles Fort , for the defense , reminded the jury of facts they must not forget : i.e. , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not and must not be separated from the history of the two-hundred-year relationshipof these two races . " What happened at the sugar camp cannotbe judged except as history , " he said . Fort quoted Benjamin Franklin , who said , " Our frontier people have been continually butchered by the Indians . We shall never have a firm peace with the Indians until we have drubbed them . " He quoted the Reverend Joseph Doddridge , who said , " The Indian kills indiscriminately . His object is the total extermination of his enemies . Children are the victims of his vengeance because , if males , they become warriors , or , if females , they become mothers . Even the state of the unborn is criminal in the redman 's view . It is not enoughp174that the unborn should perish with the mother . It is torn from the womb and elevated on a stick or a pike . If an Indian takes prisoners , he spares their lives only in order to torture them . " " These , gentlemen of the jury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of America 's greatest statesmen and , second , of one of her greatest clergymen . " Fort 's speech was interrupted at this point by Senator James Noble for the prosecution . " Judge McGowan , " said he , " I object . I ask that these words , prejudicialto impartial justice , be stricken from the record . We are not here for the purpose of reviewing the statesmanship of Ben Franklin or the spirituality of Joe Doddridge . As to Indian methods of warfare , we are here for the sole purpose this afternoon of determining the guilt or innocence of George Benson in the murder of an Indian woman . We need cool heads for this . We do not need to have our temperatures raised and our time wasted by silver-tongued lawyers attempting through recitals of past conflicts to keep our minds off the one issue here at stake : Did or did not George Benson without provocationkill the Indian woman known as Bright Water . " Judge McGowan overruled the objection . " In this case I do not believe that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past two hundred years . This remindershould not influence the jury in any way in its verdict of guilty or not guilty . George Benson did or did not kill this Indian woman . History may have played its part in his killing her . History wo n't bring her back to life . George Benson did or did not kill her . That is all that you , gentlemen of the jury , must decide . The judge in sentencing must consider the circumstances . Must consider them . Continue with your plea , Counselor . " Counselor Fort thanked the judge and continued , " Before I put Mr. Benson on the stand , I would like to recount for the jury a happeningnot two hundred years old , not one hundred years old , not fifty years old . What I am about to tell you happened within the lifetimeof many of you in the state of Ohio , from which Mr. Benson and I hail . The report I bring you is firsthand , and in my own words  --  not as eloquent perhaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but equally authentic . I was given an account of these events by the mother and daughter whose dreadful fate it had been to experiencethem . " A family by the name of Ferguson , of Scotch descent , lived on a farm some forty miles west and south of Cincinnati in what is nowp175the state of Kentucky . The father of the family , Adam Ferguson , and his fourteen-year-old son were ambushed and slaughtered by Indians while trying to harvest his corn crop . " Mrs. Ferguson , with a babe at the breast , and three older children were captured , tied to horses , and made to travel furiously to escape pursuers . During the first night , the babe began to sob . The Indians , fearing that its cries would alert followers , snatched it from its mother'sarms and brained it with a tomahawk . " When the lodges of the Indians were reached , the mother and her two daughters , age fourteen and sixteen , were bestowed as spoils of war on leading chiefs . They were passed from chief to chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the mother was traded by one chief to another for two horses . Mr. Ferguson 's scalp was taken by whatever Indian had possession of his wife and was hung at his tepee opening to remind her of what could also happen to her . The youngest girl died in captivity . The seven-year-old boy was taken farther west and never heard from again . Mother and daughter , after three years , escaped . What I have told you I heard from the lips of Rachel Ferguson herself . When I was a boy it was still common for mothers to warn their children against straying too far from the house by saying , Remember what happened to the Ferguson . ' Counselor Oscar A. Dilk then prevented Fort from calling George Benson immediately to the stand , as had been his intention . " May I inquire if it is the defense 's intention to suggest that we substitute the Old Testament injunction of an eye for an eye ' for due process of law as provided by the Constitution of these United States ? " Judge McGowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counselor , for cutting didos . " " Exactly my point , Judge . " " Mr. Dilk , consider yourself warned . Further remarks of that kind will be considered in contempt . Mr. Fort , have your witness sworn . " George Benson , though still in leg irons , had had his handcuffs removed . It was a real strain on that rambunctious man to try to talk without gesturing  --  and gesturing with his chains rattling was a real strain on the listener . Mr. Fort had arranged for their removal . Duly sworn , Mr. Benson was asked by Mr. Fort if he , too , had been warned in his childhood to " remember the Fergusons . " " No , " said Mr. Benson . " What the younguns in the Benson family were told was , Remember Grandpa .. " " Did you , when so admonished , Remember Grandpa , ' Mr. Benson ? "  | " Nobody had to remind me . I saw it happen to Grandpa . " " What was it you saw ? " " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that be , Mr. Benson ? " " I am forty-seven years old . Seven from forty-seven leaves forty . Forty from 1824 makes it 1784 . The year was 1784 . The Benson family was then living in Virginia near the banks of a crick called Little Muddy . At the end of October of that year , the time called Indian summer for reasons I do n't need to explain to anyone here , including our visitors , my grandfather , a man near seventy , was down at that crick . He was getting a load of dauby mud to use in caulking our log cabin before winter started . " Pa was working nearby , bringing in a load of pumpkins , gun with him , of course . I was playing in the cattails by the edge of the crick . I remember they were just beginning to fray out . They was well over my head , so I heard what was happening before I could see it . " First I heard Pa 's gun fire , then I heard him yell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did n't he call to you ? " " He did n't know I was there . And Grandpa was deef and did n't hear anything ' ti1 the second shot . Pa got that off just as an arrow winged him . But he made it to the house . Grandpa did n't have a chance . He started to run . First they put more arrows in him than a porcupine has quills . They scalped him while he was still alive . They cut off his privates while he was still alive . Then he died . " " And you saw all this ? " " I seen it all . I peeked out from between the sedges and seen it . I can still see it . " " But they did n't see you ? " " I would n't be here if they had . " " How did you get back to the house ? " " After sundown , when all the Indians had left , Pa came down and found me . He thought the Indians had stolen me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with the body of your murderedgrandfather ? " " I was n't right with it . I scrunched down lower and lower in the water while the redskins were prowling around . I kept hoping Grandpa might come to . But I was afraid to show myself and go to him . " " Did you remember this when you were at the sugar camp ? " " I remember it all the time . "  |p177Mr  . Fort then turned his witness over to the prosecution for crossexamination . Senator Noble had but few questions to ask . " Mr. Benson , had your grandfather ever killed any Indians ? " " Of course he had . He had lived on the frontier all of his life . A man do n't live there without killing Indians . " " Whose land was he living on ? " " His own . " " Who owned it before he did ? " " Nobody . " " Did n't Indians own it ? " " Indians do n't own land . They roam around over it . Hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort here objected . " The means by which the citizen of the United States got a foothold on this continent has no bearing on this case . Mr. Benson is to some degree responsible for the westward march of civilization in this country . But if we turn our attention to that subject we 'll be here ' til the Fourth of July . And can then celebrateappropriately what we owe to men like George Benson 's grandfather  --  whodied in order to secure for us this beautiful country . " Unless it is our intention to be here until the Fourth of July , we had better give our attention to the facts just related by George Benson . As a child he saw his beloved grandfather not only killed , but also hideously mutilated by a band of wandering savages while he , the grandfather , was peacefully employed in securing the family cabin against the winter cold . The question to be decided is this : Is that child , now grown to manhood , to be punished for remembering that bloody deed and for acting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , all undeserved , visited upon that brave old patriarch a halfcenturyago ? " After Fort had spoken , Mr. Patrick Conroy , as was proper for the most important lawyer for the defense , made the final plea for Benson . Mr. Conroy , always a strong and effective speaker , made a powerful speech . He introduced no new evidence of the kind Fort had , but he did remind the jury of the belief long standing on the frontier , that to kill an Indian was to strike a blow for the safety and well-being of the killer and his neighbors . Judge McGowan gave the jury an able charge . They were out no more than twenty minutes before they returned with a verdict of manslaughter . This verdict , after a recess for deliberation , was followed by a sentence from Judge McGowan : " Two years in prison at hard labor . "  |p178Mr  . Conroy immediately upon the sentencing sprang to his feet and said , " If the court please , we let the judgment go on the verdict and are ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . " Judge McGowan , though the state also was ready for a continuation of the trial of Benson , adjourned the court for the day . It was growing late , the hearings had been emotionally exhausting , and McGowanhad every reason to call for a halt . He instructed the court to reconvene Tuesday afternoon at two o'clock . End of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . On Tuesday , though it was noontime , nobody seemed of a mind to eat . The open space around the courthouse had for an hour been filled with many of those who had listened to or had heard about Monday 's proceedings , too restless now to light and stop talking . The buzz was like that of a swarm of bees that ca n't decide where to settle . Was what had happened right ? And , right or wrong , what would be the outcome for them ? The Indians , impassive in the courtroom , were still impassive as they stood together , too warmly dressed in their finery for the unseasonablywarm April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gestures restrained , but they were speaking to each other . What were they saying ? Many in that crowd understood more than one Indian lingo , Delaware especially , but Miami and Seneca , too . These Indians , lookouts and listening posts for their tribesmen to the north ( travel expenses paid by the government of the United States ) , were not now speaking to be heard . What they said was a matter of Indian gutturals , too low and throaty to be disentangled . Their thoughts were for each other . The courthouse crowd had had no Indian training ; their voices rose and fell . They cut the air with their gestures . They still felt stunned by yesterday 's proceedings  --  battered , elated , depressed , scared . Where were they heading ? The Cape boy 's testimony and breakdown ! God in Heaven , how much more of that could they stand ? The jury 's verdict of manslaughter ? How did they come to that ? What was manslaughter , anyway , they asked themselves . Shooting at a deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in the underbrush . A man was killed . Deadening trees , distance misjudged , and your pardner was brained by your axe . That was manslaughter , was n't it ? Many who thought it wrong to have a trial at all believed that if ap179trial were held , such a sentence was wrong . Indians were n't witless . White men who killed white women were hanged . Indians knew that . A trial was a mockery where a man who killed a peaceful Indian woman was given two years in jail . When the Indians swept down from the north , they would have two wrongs to right : killing Indian women and taking Indian men for fools . Norry Culligan , who had just strolled along , all casual-seeming , tried , without being conspicuous about it , to stay as near Charlie Fort as possible . Charlie , with the other defense lawyers , was talking over yesterday 's proceedings , and she did n't expect a word from him . A nod , perhaps . She would like to tell him that she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did in court . Thomas Gunn , jury foreman , a woolly-headed giant , hair sheepcurlyand sheep-colored , came up to Charlie . " Mr. Fort , " he said , " you got time for a question ? " " I 'll take time , " Charlie said . " Manslaughter , " said Gunn , " is unpremeditated killing , ai n't it ? Kind of accidental ? " " That 's the way it 's defined . " " Did n't Benson have killing in mind when he went to the Indian camp ? " " I did n't make that decision , Mr. Gunn . You jurymen did that . " " You want to know why we did , Mr. Fort ? Way back there when that boy lay in the sedges and saw his grandfather hacked up by the redskins , something went into him and took hold of him and was his master . So what he did was manslaughter . No more murder than when a bull tosses a man . It was his nature speaking ; nothing he had to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put Benson on the stand . And it was the way I persuaded the other jurymen to vote . " Charlie had n't himself thought of the killing in just such terms  --  though it had been his intention to remind the jury that they lived in a time and a place where the past still stained the present . His plea had been made in court and had been successful . He did n't intend to enlarge upon it here . And before he could even thank Gunn , Sarah Benson , with children at her heels , not tall , but buxom enough to envelop Tom Gunn from knees to shoulders , threw her arms around the jury foreman . If a man 's character is to be decided by the appearance of his wife , Benson was not a bad man ; Sarah would certainly never see forty again , but to judge by her rosy unlinedface she had enjoyed the last twenty of those years.  |p180She  was crying now , cheeks like plum blossoms in the rain . " Oh , Mr. Gunn , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but God will , for saving my husband 's life . Me and my children will forever be in your debt . For the rest of your natural life you will be second in our hearts only to George Benson himself . Want for nothing . Me and the children will be at your beck and call . Oh , God bless you for your noble heart . " Charlie , afraid that Sarah would next remember the part he had played in defending her husband , and knowing that Benson 's troubles were not yet over , turned to his landlady , who was still close to him . " Norry , " he said , " I 'm surprised you could bring yourself to come here after what we had to listen to yesterday . " " I closed my ears to the killings and listened to you plead , " Norry said . " I fixed a pickup dinner for you and Hannah , if you want to inviteher to the house . " Norry did n't expect a miracle , but she did n't close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " I 'd like to talk over the trial with a woman of more experience than Hannah , " she was n't going to argue . That was n't the reply she expected and it was n't the one she got . " I have n't seen Hannah , " Charlie said . Norry pointed . In a crowd of women , Hannah could n't be missed . Surrounded by men , she loomed less spectacularly . She was with men now  --  her father , Colonel Johnston , Judge McGowan , Jonathan Armitage , the prosecutor , a couple of the jurors . " You sure you fixed the dinner for me and Hannah ? " " Unless you 've found yourself another girl , Charlie . " " I 'm susceptible , Norry , but I ai n't fickle . " Charlie was of two minds about joining the crowd around Hannah . As it turned out , he did n't have to . Hannah , responding to his wave , came to him . " Norry has fixed us a bite to eat at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norry was heading quickly away from Charlie . Hannah watched her resolute departure . " Why is that woman so good to us ? " she asked . " She 's an old lady without any children left at home , " Charlie said . " We take their place . " Hannah looked at Charlie . It was easier for her to see in Charlie what Norry saw , easier than for Charlie to understand the feelings of a woman old enough to be the mother he 'd never had . " She 's in love with you , " Hannah said . " My God , Hannah , " said Charlie , " I 've got enough troubles inp181this trial without you working your imagination overtime on Norry . She 's a grandmother ; did n't you know that ? " " She do n't think of you as a grandson . Likely she had a young husband , just your spit and image . She looks at you and remembers him  --  and forgets all the time in between . " " I look at her and remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eat . " Norry had put food on the table and covered it with a white fringed cloth to keep off flies . Custard pie , cream and brown like a Jersey cow ; deviled eggs ; pickled beets . Food pretty to look at , but look at was all they could do . They could n't take the time to fill their mouths with pretty pink beets or deviled eggs or pie the color of a Jersey cow , though that was their intention . They sat down , picked up napkins , then rose , threw their napkins away , and clasped each other . " I have to be in court in an hour , " Charlie said . " I know , " said Hannah . Their kiss was intended as a farewell . " Good-bye for a while . We part to meet again . " It was not a farewell ; it was an invitation , urgent but unacceptable . Hannah lost track of boundaries . Which was her mouth ? Which mouth was Charlie 's ? She did not know . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking in her body . Kissing Charlie good-bye hurt as no farewell bow could . They gave the pie and the eggs to Scooter . " He 'll get so fat Norry will notice . " Scooter would not touch pickled beets . " I 'll eat the beets , " Charlie said . " It will be a long hard afternoon , and I better have something to run on . " After he ate the beets , Charlie 's mouth was so red they had to kiss the stains away . There were ten minutes left . " Charlie , " said Hannah , " we must n't make love any more . " " Because it is wrong ? " " It is wrong , " Hannah said , " but wrong would n't stop me . Besides , afterward , I do n't feel like I 've done wrong . If I stole or lied , my conscience would hurt afterward . But afterward , now . . . " Hannah paused , thinking . " Afterward  --  how do you feel , Hannah ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with the holy word . " So why must we stop ? " " You know why , Charlie . " " Yes , I know why . "  | " I 've talked to Ora about it . She told me some things . I 'm not ignorant . " " We 're going to be married , you know , Hannah . " " I do n't want to have to be married . " " You and I have to be married . You know that , Hannah . There 'd be no sense in not . As soon as this trial is over . " " Then we must n't any more  --  until the trial is over . " " No , we must n't , Hannah . You 're right . " Charlie held Hannah in his arms . No kissing now . She might havebeen ten years old or his mother . " But you must help me , Hannah . " " I will help you , Charlie . I will . I always will . You know that . "  |p183Judge  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour before the afternoon session started . He leaned his head against the supporting curve of black walnut , a curve shiny from the hair oil of many heads that had rested there in the years since it had first been made . He closed his eyes and kept them closed . If people thought he was sleeping , they might let him alone . There was nothing to be gained but more pain in his midsection from listening to the talk of those who thought the entire trial was a big mistake , and the way it was being run a bigger one . As to the trial itself , a judge did n't overridehis jury . In England , two hundred years ago , it could be done . The jury got its instructions from the judge . " Bring in a verdict of guilty , " it was told , and did so . But even in England jurors had taken the bit in their teeth and found for guilt or innocence as their consciencesdictated . And if their decisions left the judge thunderstruck , so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How a jury arrived at the decision that shooting a woman pointblankwas manslaughter was beyond him . But with that verdict , he had no choice in his sentencing . Men are not hanged for manslaughter . The courtroom was filling up . With his eyes closed he could tell that . He could shut out understanding of what was being said , but the increased volume of voices gave him the feeling of a sea moving nearer and nearer . What made him open his eyes was not the sound of anyone 's voice or of any sound whatever , but a feeling of warmth near him . He felt like he 'd put on another jacket , or as if a cloud that had hid the sun from shining on him had moved on . What was next to him when he opened his eyes was the bulk of Black Antler , three inches away , hot with feeling , trembling with conviction , and with more than the usual amount of Indian lard on his bones to radiate all this . " Judge , " said Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . " McGowan opened his eyes wider and moved deeper into his chairp184to avoid the heat of Black Antler 's body  --  and the enigma of his thinking . An Indian with a hatchet would surprise him  --  Johnston had his Indians under better control than that  --  but less so than Black Antler congratulating him on the light sentence he had given Benson . " With the verdict what it was , I did n't have much choice in my sentence . " " No one should be killed for killing . It is not the Indian way . It is not the way of Handsome Lake and the Old Long House faith . " " What do you do with your killers ? " " Except in war , we are not killers . " " Sometimes , surely ? " " Sometimes . That man is made an outcast . He will not be spoken to or fed . He is cast out . " " Does n't he die ? " " If the Great Spirit wills . We do not kill him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial for murder should not be found guilty ? " " Found guilty . Not killed . " " Set them free , they 'll do the same thing over again . " " I did not say set free . ' I said not killed . ' " " Put them in prison for the rest of their lives ? They 'd rather be strung up . " " I think so . But to kill for killing is not our way . " McGowan nodded toward the line that had once again formed at the back of the room . " It is their way . " " With your people , not our own . They have been at war with your people . They want them killed because that is war . " " What if they knew you were here asking me to spare them ? " " They think I am crazy . " " You know what my people would say ? That you 're crazy like a fox . That you 'd persuade us not to hang the killers so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not keep their word . They did not have a fair trial . ' Then they would kill every settlerin the Fall Creek valley . You know that , do n't you ? " " I know that . " " Then why do you tell me that these men , even if found guilty of murder , should n't be hanged ? " " I tell you what I think is right . I tell you because I think that right is what you want to do . " " The boy you were teaching was killed . You heard how he was killed . "  | " We can not bring Folded Leaf to life . What he was learning might not die . " Judge McGowan stared at Black Antler . Beyond him , around him , the courtroom was now filled with people , who were silent , watching . " My God , Black Antler , you do n't help me much . I ca n't sentence according to Seneca Faithkeepers . Or according to what strikes me or you as right or wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . I have sworn before God to do so . And before God I will do so . " McGowan rose . He towered , a tall gaunt man , over the Seneca . He struck the table in front of him with his closed fist . There is one Indian who 's going to think twice before he talks back to McGowan again was the thought in the courtroom . It was a true thought . Black Antler , who was not one of the observersbrought down from the north by the government , took a seat by himself in the courtroom . The people he knew best had been killed . Neither whites nor reds trusted him . Both believed in killing . Even to the whites , an Indian 's plan for sparing a white appeared a plot . Black Antler believed in the words of Handsome Lake , " Do not punish killing with more killing " ; he felt the presence of Folded Leaf , now able to communicate directly with Handsome Lake , reassuringand commending . He sat at ease . He had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already on edge and more stirred up than ever by his seeming dismissal of Black Antler , into silence . George Benson , given a new lease on life by the light sentence he had received yesterday , was brought to the prisoners ' box . Not only had his chalk color brightened ; he appeared to have gained weight during the recess . He was no longer the sagging sallow man who had listened to Ben Cape 's account of the death of Folded Leaf . He managedhis leg irons like gaiters  --  no effort at all , an adornment , if anything . His blue eyes were once again saucy and bellicose . Once again he was the hero  --  the man who had saved the whites , defied the Indians , and was cunning enough to control the court . George Benson , above the law and born to command . If the court had n't known for a fact that Benson had spent the night and morning in the straw of the Pendleton jail , eating boiled beans and sowbelly , they would have been convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of corn whiskey . What was bubblingp186inside George Benson was something stronger than corn  --  hope , raw , bubbling , uplifting . After Armitage , for the prosecution , had summarized the case against Benson , Fort put Benson on the stand . He had no intention of spoiling the effect Benson 's account of the death of his grandfather at the hands of Indians had had on the jury the previous afternoon . He wanted that to stay in the jurors ' minds , not Benson 's admission that he had killed a stripling . He kept his questions brief . " Mr. Benson , you have been accused of killing the Indian boy named Folded Leaf . Did you do so ? " " I did . " He had admitted it a half-dozen times elsewhere , and , faced as he was with what he thought a sensible jury , there was not much point in lying . " Was n't the death of the squaw sufficient revenge for the death of your grandfather ? " " I did n't kill Folded Leaf for revenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boy was crawling toward me . I killed him to protect myself . " " Was he threatening you with a gun or knife ? " " Have you ever fought Indians , Mr. Fort ? " " I never have . " " If an Indian has designs on your life , he do n't go brandishing his weapons about . " " The boy did n't have a gun , did he ? " " No gun . But he could 've had a knife . Seeing what I 've seen in the past , I was n't taking no chances . " " So you killed Folded Leaf in self-defense ? " " I did . And if you 'd been there , you 'd of done the same . " Judge McGowan did n't permit talk like that in his court . " Your defense attorney is not being tried for any crime , Mr. Benson . Confine yourself to answering his questions , not to speculating as to what he might or might not have done . " " Yes , your honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lawyer to preserve the good will the court had displayed toward him yesterday . " I killed the boy because he was threatening me . " Charlie , doubting that Benson would do himself any more good on the stand , said , " The defense rests . " Dilk then took over the cross-examination of Benson . Judge McGowan , who had seen every Indiana lawyer , and many from other states , perform before him , felt sorry for Benson . Dilk was no natural orator like Fort ; no birds would fall charmed fromp187the trees when he talked . But he would take that jury over the logical jumps of the killing so smoothly it would end up with " murder " in its mouth without knowing how the word got there . Dilk made no reference to the verdict returned by the jury for the killing of a squaw  --  except to praise the jurors for their attention to detail and devotion to duty . They blossomed under his commendation . There was not a jot of difference in law between the two killings  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Benson and the jurors knew was hard to say . Benson got healthier-looking by the moment . McGowan tried not to see him . He wanted to pass a note to Benson reading , " Keep in mind that Dilk is here to prosecuteyou , not defend you . " The direction in which Dilk was moving was at once apparent to McGowan . He was carefully , guardedly , leading the jurors to believe that no matter what the law said ( and those jurors did n't know what the law said anyway ) , there was a world of difference between shootinga squaw and bashing out the brains of a small boy . Dilk was so guiding the jury that it could in good conscience , and all as legal in their minds as a Philadelphia lawyer full of scrapple and scuppernong , call one killing " manslaughter " and the other " murder . " Benson faced the questioning unsuspecting , pleased with himself , the jury  --  and even with Dilk , who was laying the trap Benson would spring . " Did you kill Folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Benson . Then Dilk produced something from a kind of carpetbag he had . " Do you recognize this garment , Mr. Benson ? " The garment he held up was a calico blouse , of a kind that could be bought in Pendleton . These blouses were much fancied by Indians because of their bright colors . This one had been red , but it was now so stiffened and discolored by something that had been spilled upon it that little of the original red was visible . Benson looked , but did not speak . Dilk repeated his question . " No , " said Benson . But his face did not say no . " Do you recognize what kind of a garment this is ? " " A shirt . " " For a grown-up or a child ? " " A child , it looks like . " " What age would you say ? "  | " Ten or twelve . " " Would you be able to identify the shirt if you could see the color ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know why you ca n't ? " " The shirt 's dirty . " " Do you know what that dirt ' is ? " Benson sat in silence . " Well , I 'll tell you , Mr. Benson , and the jury , what that dirt is . You may then find that your memory has been refreshed when you hear . " Dilk held the blouse , first facing the jury , then the accused . " The rusty brown stains are blood . Great gouts and spurts of blood fell , probably from the head , onto this garment  --  especially about the front , shoulders , and back . If you 'll notice here , Mr. Benson and gentlemen of the jury , where the color is more gray than rust and the blouse is stiffened almost as if it had been starched , that discolorationwas not caused by blood . That gray matter is human gray matter , a boy 's brains spilled out of his shattered skull onto his pretty red store-boughten blouse . Now , Mr. Benson , that what you called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize Folded Leaf 's red shirtas it looked before you smashed his skull against a tree butt ? " Benson got to his feet . He was a sick-looking man again . " You know why I killed that boy . Counselor Fort told you . He explained it all . My grandfather . . . This boy would grow up and do the same thing . " Dilk , without replying , took from his carpetbag a second garment , a pair of buckskin pantaloons as bloodstained as the blouse . He held the pantaloons from the waistband for all to see . One leg was intact ; the other had been sheared off at thigh height , so that what was left of it hung in a few tatters of bloodstained buckskin . " A boy with a leg like this was going to be a threat to whites ? " " He was crawling toward Ben Cape right then . . . you heard me say so . " " I heard Ben Cape say he was trying to get some help . " " I killed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering . It 's just like the counselor said . I did it to put him out of his misery . I knowed he was suffering . I took the quickest way . . . . " Judge McGowan stopped his ravings . " Sit down , Mr. Benson . Speak only to answer questions . " Benson sat and Dilk then addressed himself to the jury.  | " Gentlemen of the jury , I see I need not tell you that the case you had to consider yesterday and the one you have to consider today are very different . In the first , you found the prisoner guilty of manslaughterfor using his rifle on a grown squaw . In the second , a boy , who went where his parents went , with no choice of his own , was taken by his heels and had his brains knocked out against a tree . " Dilk held up the shirt . He demonstrated where the material had been stiffened by the spilling of brain matter . He held up the pantaloons , touching the shattered leg as tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most of you have now , or have had , children this size in your house . Look at his shirt ! Look at these pants , leg missing ! That boy would never have walked again . Poor helpless child . Taken by his heels like a rabbit and brained . If the one case was manslaughter  --  and I have not argued against that verdict  --  is this not murder ? If the one was the act of an evil man , was this not the act of a brutal murderer ? " Judge McGowan had given the jury a clear charge before it had retired for its verdict on the murder of the squaw . He saw no need of repeating it . He said only , " The charge is as before . " The jury , soft-footed in their moccasins , went into their little room behind the benches where they sat . Dilk left the shirt and pantaloons on the table before him . The courtroom was silent . Benson 's bull neck had bent . His head hung on a curve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People had given up looking at the Indians . There was no telling from their appearance how matters stood with them . The skin across Judge McGowan 's cheekbones was tight . One eyelidtwitched . He rolled a pencil between forefinger and thumb , The jury , after an absence of not many minutes , returned , silent as before . They were men who knew how to manage their bodies : no stumbling , shuffling , seating , and reseating . " Have you reached a verdict ? " asked Judge McGowan . Thomas Gunn , the big Scot with sheep-textured hair , rose . " We have . " " What is the verdict , Mr. Foreman ? " Gunn replied in a level voice , " Guilty of murder in the first de-gree . " The prisoner was remanded , and the court adjourned.  |p190The  court had adjourned late , near suppertime . After that verdict , the strength appeared to have gone out of the onlookers ' legs . Many still sat as if felled by a blow . What kind of a sentence could McGowangive after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead boy were spread out on the table . A few people filed by for a look and blanched at the sight . The boy had died a terrible death ; no two ways about it . The Cape family was strong enough to stand on its feet and start toward the Baldwin home . Hannah knew she should go with them ; she was expected at her cousins ' , depended upon to help with the cooking and clearing up . She knew that she should be feeling sorrow for George Benson , his wife and six children . If Colonel Johnston had his way , if murder in the first degree of an Indian carried the same punishment as the murder of a white , George Benson was alreadydead , his wife a widow and his children fatherless . Hannah was sorry , but at the moment she honestly was grieving more for Charlie . Charlie had done nothing more than lose a case  --  his life was n't at stake  --  but she loved Charlie . This she knew was wrong , but you hurt where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Charlie . She lingered in the courthouse yard . She struck up conversations with first one person , then another , so that her own family , turning their heads to look for her , would think her detained out of courtesy and friendliness . When they were out of sight , she gave up make-believe friendlinessand searched in earnest for Charlie . He was still in the courtroom , backed into a corner with McGowan and Giddings and Noble . Charlie saw her over the heads of his companions and left them to join her . " Let 's walk in the woods , " Hannah said , though she knew as well as he did why couples around Pendleton walked in the woods . " Where else can we be alone ? " she asked . " To talk . " " I do n't know , " Charlie answered.  |p191He  did n't know that he felt like any more talk . He 'd had his fill . Dilk 's words still rang in his ears . The verdict clanged in his head like a fire bell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , " he said . " The end of what ? " " The trials . Bemis 's already confessed . God knows what that Wood boy will say , once they put him on the stand . Old man Wood boasted to everybody long ago about the part he played in the massacre . " " I know a place to rest , " Hannah said , ignoring the trial . There were dark shadows under Charlie 's eyes . His cheeks looked hollow . This was a time when she should think of Charlie , not of herself . Standing up had n't done any good anyway . Besides , she and Charlie had come to an agreement : no more love-making until they were married . Love-making itself was n't wrong , but the baby that Ora said was sure to come if you did n't want it would be a shame to her parents  --  and to herself . A girl who could n't wait ! She was a girl who could wait , wait a thousand years , rather than have a poor infant born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort Charlie , let him talk to her about the trial and what he thought he might do for poor Johnny Wood . She would tell him how Reba had belittled Johnny , practically pushed him into the killing . Then , before they went home , there might be time to talk about the wedding . What she would wear . Would her father marry them ? Would they have a honeymoon on one of the river boats plying between Madison and Cincinnati ? " I know where there is a leaf cave , " she told Charlie . " What 's a leaf cave ? " " Come on and see . " She and her Baldwin cousins had discovered the leaf cave . Fox grapes , climbing a sycamore tree at the edge of a branch , had reached the top limbs , then spilled downward , making a green umbrella above tree roots clear to the water 's edge . " It 's a little leaf house , " she said . " It belongs to me and the Baldwins . Look , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which room is mine ? " " Every one is yours . Lie down . Rest . " " Are you going to stand up and watch me ? " " No . You lie down and rest , and I'lll sit beside you . Forget the trial for a while . " He felt like lying down . The land sloped gently toward the branch in the right way for resting . Hannah , with some idea of being a nurse to a man who had suffered a setback , dampened his handkerchiefp192in the branch and wiped his face . After that she kissed his closed eyes , ran her tongue along his eyelashes , made him a mustache out of her braid , undid his collar so that she could feel his Adam 's apple , ran her tongue along the grooves of his ear like a worm in the tunnels of a half-eaten apple , and finally picked up his head and rocked it against her breasts like a nursing baby . He forgot there ever had been a trial and did n't care who was hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , and Hannah yelled , " You promised , you promised . " " I promised not to do anything to make us have a baby . I 'm not . " " You will be in a minute . " She was right . He had her bodice half unbuttoned . " You promised to help me , " Charlie said . " Then you come in hereand lie down with me and hold me and kiss me . What help is that ? " " It is not making a baby . It is helping you to forget the trial . It is helping you to forget Dilk and Benson . " " Dilk Hannah and would Benso  --  ot " he waste asked . any " Who breath are they ? " answering foolish questionslike that . He unbuttoned and she buttoned . This was becoming less love-making and more wrestling . And Hannah was more eel than otter . He had sometimes wondered how he 'd make out as a rapist . Hannah sure was n't the girl to practice on . " I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her the purpose of these embraces . He , not Hannah , relaxed when he said that . She turned him onto his back , sat on top of him , and looked him in the eye . " I hate you , Charlie Fort . You are not a man of your word . Youare not strong in body or soul . I never want to see you again . " Having said this , Hannah leaped to her feet and ran , hair streaming , bodice half unbuttoned , out of the house of leaves . Charlie 's first impulse was to follow her . He jumped to his feet , then thought better of it . In the first place , he might not be able to catch up with her . And if he did , on the outskirts of Pendleton , what would people think ? They 'd think that what had not happened had . They 'd have the name without the game . He went back into the leaf house and thought , If this branch were big enough , I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't . He started walking home , home being Norry Culligan 's house . Hannah , always a brisk hand with broom and dishrag , outdid herself that evening at the Baldwins ' . Her father watched her with sym/pathy . He was downhearted himself and wished there was some wood-chopping or tree-felling he could do to sweat away some of his misery . Keep out of the way was about the best he could do  --  and that did n't do much to relieve his feelings . Pendleton was n't a town big enough or fastidious enough to prohibitpig-keeping . Enos Baldwin , Lizzie 's brother , who owned Pendleton'sone general store , had a big family , set a good table , and there was always plenty of slop for the hogs . The wash-up that evening was big . Caleb carried the bucket of slop , while Hannah carried the table scraps , to the pen out behind the privy where Spot and Pinky lived . A pig admiring the sunset may not be the prettiest sight in the world but a pig with his snout in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of a hand pump working on a well that 's about to go dry , ought not to move anyone to tears . Nevertheless , Hannah was crying . Caleb said , " There ai n't been no sentence set yet . " Hannah was n't crying about George Benson or his orphans-to-be or his widow . She was crying about Charlie , sad , tired , repulsed , reviled . Told he was weak in body and soul . His defense of Benson had gone to pieces . She saw him now stretched out on his attic bed recalling , as she was , every painful word that had been spoken that afternoon . She said , " I 'm never going to give any pig I 'm going to eat a name . I think if it 's going to be meat , you should treat it like meat from the beginning . Not give it a human name , then go out one day , knock it on the head , and fry it . I will never do that as long as I live . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb doubted that his manly daughter was crying her heart out over pork that had been named . He doubted that her feeling for Benson was strong enough to cause this outburst . " There was no way in the world , " he said , " Charlie Fort could have got a decision for Benson in the face of the evidence Dilk showed the jury . " Hannah continued to sob . " He got jurors to bend the law in the squaw 's case . He 's a goodlawyer , but a jury 's got to judge by the law . Not by smooth talk , " Hannah used the apron to dry her eyes , then uncovered her face . " That 's what I told him he was , Papa . Just a smooth talker . " " When did you do all this ? " " This evening  --  just after the trial was over . "  | " That was piling the punishment on pretty high . " " I know it . I 'm sorry for it now . But he said some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours is going to get you in real trouble some-day . " " I 'm in real trouble now . " " What kind of trouble do you call real , Hannah ? " " Charlie hates me , I think . " " Well , you go tell him you 're sorry for what you said , and he 'll stop hating you , I expect . " " Tell him right now ? " " It 's no more than first dark  --  and less than a five-minute run to Mrs. Culligan 's . You 'll feel better , and he will , too , like as not , if you say , Charlie , my tongue ran away with me . ' Never let the sun set on your wrath . Well , it 's too late for that . Sun 's down already . But my advice to you , Hannay , is to sashay over there , say you 're sorry , then run back home with a clear conscience . " Hannah took off her apron , threw it to her father , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go  --  both with appreciation for her clean run , knees not clacking together in the hen run of most women , and with appreciation of his own understanding of the heart problems of the young . Most fathers would have lost long ago the memory of the wound a few ill-chosen words can have on a young heart . Most fathers would not have had enough understanding and trust to send their daughters after dark to carry a message of contrition to a courter . Courting , he surmised , was what young Fort had in mind with Hannah . He was n't blind to Hannah 's faults . Her height and her quick tongue were enough to scare off most boys . But Fort had a tongue of his own and inches to spare . Caleb went into the Baldwin hubbub feeling that in spite of his heaviness about Benson , some things in the world were still hopeful and headed toward happiness . The run went out of Hannah when she saw the glimmer of light in Mrs. Culligan 's house . It was one thing to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , " Charlie , you are not weak in body and soul . I love you with all my heart . Do n't shame us by making us have a baby so that people will say we had to get married . But if that 's what you must do , I love you anyway . " It was another thing to walk bald-faced up to Mrs. Culligan 's door , knock , and ask top195see Mr. Fort , please . She knew what the outcome of that would be insofar as Norry Culligan was concerned . " What chance has the poor boy ? " Mrs. Culligan would tell the neighbors . " That big girl knocking on his door bold as brass , at bedtime . If I had n't been there , I reckon she 'd of gone right up the stairs to find him . In bed or out . " But her father had been right . She would n't be able to close her eyes once that night until she had said , " Forgive me , Charlie . " Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was likely suffering as much as she was . More , perhaps . He was the one who had been given those cruel names . What if he had called her such names ? Ugly  --  or mean ? Her run had slowed to a walk . Her walk was one step at a time , but she continued in the direction of the glimmer . She climbed the steps of Mrs. Culligan 's little front porch noiselessly , so that , if at the last minute her courage failed , she could turn and run home and no one need be the wiser . She had n't the power in her arm for a real knock . Just touch the boards as if , in the dream in which she was walking , all she had to do was touch the wood with her fingers and the door would fly open and Charlie would take her in his arms . It was n't a dream , or if it was , no one else was in it . There was no answer to her whisper of a knock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silently she went along the small porch to the window of what , besides the kitchen , was the one downstairs room . The glimmerof light she had seen came from a candle set on the night table at the foot of the stairs to light Charlie to the attic . At first , in the gloom of its flicker , she saw nothing but the dim outlines of furniture . Then , as if they were in a picture filled in little by little by a hand determined that she miss nothing , she saw the two white bodies on Norry Culligan 's bed , a bed built against the wall across from the window . The white bodies at first were no more than outlines . They were short and long , round and slab-sided , hairy and hairless , dark and fair , asleep and awake . They were male and female . They were Charlie Fort and Norry Culligan . When Hannah saw this , the entire bed , with the bodies on it , seemed to move to the very edge of the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wavery candlelight , every detail of the faces and bodies of Charlie Fort and Norry Culligan . Charlie was asleep , lying with no leg or arm extended in affection toward Norry Culligan , and the sight comforted her some . Oh , God , in our extremity what banquets we make of crumbs ! If Norry Culligan in the light of the day was an old lady , in candlelightp196she did n't show it . Short , plump , and white as a squab . She was on one elbow , her back to the window , watching Charlie as he slept . Hannah crept away from the window , down the porch , past Scooter , who expected her to give him something to eat . There was no run left in her . She crippled home like a string-haltered horse . She had n't known that anyone could feel so sick without being on his deathbed . Ben , coming home after Folded Leaf 's death ? She could n't vomit up the ball of stone that rested midway between her chest and stomach . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie had n't meant a word of what he said . Love her ? Marry her ? That was the kind of talk he used to get a girl down on her back with her clothes off , kissing and cooing and clasping . He had probably asked Norry Culligan to marry him , too . And at her age he would n't have to worry about babies . In the midst of these thoughts , another , even more troubling , came to her : I brought it on myself . If I had loved him this afternoon when he wanted me to , this would never have happened . Then an even bleaker thought came to her . Perhaps it would have happened anyway . Perhaps it had been happeningall along . Just because Charlie is the one man in the world for me does n't mean that I am the one woman in the world for Charlie . She longed for some remedy for her pain . If there were nettles or a bramble patch , she 'd like to walk through it , roll in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many places and so deep that the pain on the outside would make her forget the pain on the inside . Her father was waiting for her under the beech tree at the end of the lane that led to the Baldwins ' . " I was getting uneasy about you , " he said . " A midnight visit was n't what I had in mind . " " I did n't even go in . " " Was n't anyone home ? " " They both were . Charlie was in bed . " " So you did n't get to deliver your message ? " " Mrs. Culligan delivered it . " " Well , are you forgiven ? " " No . It 's all over . " " Cheer up , Hannay . Quarrel in the evening ; kiss in the morning . That 's the tune lovers play . " " No . I 'll never speak to Charlie Fort again . "  |p197Caleb  knew better than to try to reason with the lovesick . Reason to the lovesick was like fire to the feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to bed , " he told his daughter . " Poor Johnny Wood is going on the stand tomorrow . Armitage 'll make mincemeat of him , I do n't doubt . His troubles outweigh yours a thousandfold . " " Ben had to tell what he did , did n't he ? " " Yes . But Ben had n't done anything . " " He told what Johnny did . " " Did you want him to lie ? " " Yes . To save Johnny . " " I do n't think the good Lord gave Ben the power to lie . " " He gave it to me , " Hannah said . " I got my share of lying power and Ben 's added to it . I would have lied to save Johnny . " " You go on to bed now , Hannah . You 're overwrought . No use staying up worrying about might've-beens . " " No use , " Hannah agreed . " No use in the world . "  |p198The  courthouse was filled an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tried that day , Johnny Wood , had not yet been brought over from the jail . Judge McGowan was not yet in his place . The word was around that the judge alternated these days between praying and drinking glasses of water spiked with bakingsoda . No one envied him his job . The jury , with eleven other jurors to back up each individual juror in his decision , was not in a place so stony lonesome as the judge . It is easier to say " We all did it " than " I did it . " The lawyers , dragging in from a night of playing seven-up ( some said worse ) , or working up their cases , or writing letters home , were as early as the spectators . The defense attorneys were having a conference . Charlie Fort had arrived first , hoping to see and talk to Hannah . He saw her , all right , talking to , or being talked to by , O. A. Dilk . When he caught her eye , and his eyes were instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , Hannah , " she looked at him with a stare as vacant as if he were a passing coon hound . He was glad for the attention he had to give to the problem that faced the defense . Looking at Hannah , he might cry . Noah Beazley said , " Is there any point getting that Cape boy up here and having him repeat once again what we already heard ? " " No use for us , " Charlie said , " but the prosecution may insist on it . " " Maybe not , " Beazley argued . " Charlie , you know Dilk better than the rest of us . Why do n't you ask him if he 'll agree to a stipulation , if we do , that the Cape boy 's testimony be made a part of the court record and that we spare the boy  --  and ourselves  --  another repetitionof that bloody story ? Dilk ought to be willing  --  looks like he 's trying to stand in well with the boy 's sister . " " Dilk 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remindedthem . " Armitage and Noble are . " " Little guns can signal big guns . Dilk will try harder in this onep199instance to see it our way , and to get others to see it our way . If he wo n't , what 've we lost ? " Beazley said . " Say they agree to the stipulation , " Charlie said , " what 's our next move ? " " Put the accused on the stand . He 's got a right to defend himself , however you look at it . One boy , obviously worked up , says young Wood shot an Indian woman , first in one tit , then in the other . That do n't make real-good sense . It sounds more like what a fourteenyear-oldboy would like to see . " " His stepmother bragged at church that the boy had given as good an account of himself as any man at the massacre , " Fort said . " Watch yourself , Charlie , " Vickers said . " Massacre ' is the prosecution'sword , not ours . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocker , if you ask me . " " Now , now , Isaac , " Beazley said . " When you and Charlie are around , all the ladies get kind of teetery on their rockers . That do n't undermine their judicial judgment . " Charlie wanted to get away from that subject . " I can see some point in our putting young Wood on the stand . He 's the unlikeliest-looking murderer I ever saw , and probably the unlikeliest the jury ever saw . The jury 's going to have a hard time finding that sweet-faced boy guilty of murder in any degree . Let alone first . Let alone murder , the way Ben Cape says he committed it . I doubt the Wood boy 's that much of a marksman , anyway . My God ! First one tit and then the other . He ought to be in a circus if he can shoot like that . " " Yeh , he sure is wasted out here shooting Indians if he can do that , " agreed Vickers . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can see it 's a subject you boys like to dwell on . But are we of the same mind about putting young Wood on the stand ? " " Yes , " said Vickers , " there 's everything to gain and nothing to lose . Charlie , you talk to Dilk . " Charlie hoped to talk to Hannah as well as to Dilk , but Hannah , as he approached , turned her back and walked away . Dilk , as Beazley had suggested , was eager to spare the Cape boy any further torment on the witness stand . In addition , he did not see that much could be gained for the prosecution by hearing the story repeated once again . " I think I can promise you , Charlie , that the prosecution will agree to the stipulation . You put the Wood boy on the stand now and thenp200we 'll cross-examine . But do n't say I did n't warn you . I 'd never let a witness like that testify if I was representing him . " " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already heard ? " " Something worse can always be said , " Dilk replied . The prosecution agreed , as Dilk thought they would , to the stipulation . Ben Cape 's testimony as to what he had seen Johnny Wood do at the sugar camp was read into the record and Johnny was put on the stand as a defense witness . Noah Beazley , solid and fatherly , took over for the defense . The courtroom audience believed the evidence that had been brought in by Ben Cape to be patently true . They did n't think that Ben had the spark to make up a story to save his own life , let alone the gumption or inclination to fabricate a story to endanger someone else 's life . Dilk , who had been responsible for the guilty verdict brought in yesterday afternoon , had this morning off . He was making good use of it , sitting on a front-row bench with Hannah by his side . Beazley put Johnny on the stand . The boy put down a book he had been reading . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door , because the weather was still June in April , was wide open . Two white butterflies flew in , then flew out . Give him a beard and long hair and Johnny , with his open hazel eyes and dark damask-rose complexion , could be the picture of the young Jesus seen helping in his father 's carpentry shop . Even Armitage would n't dare be too cross-grained with such a witness , and certainly Beazley was n't . He was firm but gentle with the boy , and the boy responded , neither nervous nor truculent . He went into the questioningas if all he had to do was to make his whole story known to be understood and excused . Beazley : " Did you accompany your father and your uncle to the Indian sugar camp ? " Johnny : " Yes , sir . " Beazley : " Did you have a gun ? " Johnny : " Yes , sir . " Beazley : " What was the purpose of the gun ? " Johnny : " I was going squirrel-hunting . " Beazley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Johnny : " Yes , sir . " Beazley : " Were they going squirrel-hunting , too ? "  |p201Johnny  : " No , sir . They were hunting Mr. Clasby 's horses . They thought the Indians might have stolen them . " Beazley : " Did they take their guns so they could kill the Indians ? " Johnny : " They always took their guns when they left home . " Beazley : " To kill Indians ? " Johnny : " No , sir . To protect themselves . " Beazley : " But you took yours to kill squirrels ? " Johnny : " Yes , sir . You can ask Ben Cape if I did n't . I stopped in there to ask him to go with me . " Beazley : " We 've already asked Ben that question , and he says you asked him to go squirrel-hunting . " Johnny : " Yes , sir , that 's the truth . That 's what I asked him . " Beazley : " But Ben says that you gave up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian hunt . " Johnny : " No , sir . I never did that . " Beazley : " Well , what do you call it then ? You shot and killed an Indian woman . " Johnny : " No , sir . I never shot and killed any Indian woman . " Beazley : " You 're under oath , you know , now . If you do n't tell the truth now , it 's not just a lie . It 's perjury . Perjury is punishable by law . " Johnny : " I know that . I 'm telling the truth . " Hannah tried not to stare at either Charlie or Johnny . She had failed one and the other had paid her back in kind . Or maybe neither one had really loved her . Johnny had certainly never said so . Charlie had said so time after time , but with Charlie it was perhaps a habit . By looking steadily at Johnny , though , she could avoid catching Charlie 's eye . If she did that , she might catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a magnifying glass . Johnny did n't look at her . He looked into space , waiting for Mr. Armitage 's questions . Jonathan Armitage , as if he himself understood that any too rough handling of this soft-spoken stripling would prejudice his case with the jury , shed all of his prosecutors ' tactics . He spoke like an uncle to a nephew , one who 'd been absent for a time and was now anxious for the latest news . Armitage : " I 'm Jonathan Armitage , Johnny . I 'd like to talk to you some more about what happened at the sugar camp . You were there , I believe ? " Johnny : " Yes , I was there . "
