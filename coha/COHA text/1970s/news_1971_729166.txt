txt Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy warned yesterday that he was preparing for the " agonizing decision " of recommending to Mayor Lindsay , possibly today , that National Guard troops be called to replace striking policemen . Mr. Murphy said the decision would have to be made " within the next two days " because the point was approaching " where we ca n't continue to protect the community . " It was the first time since the police crisis began last Thursday that a high-ranking city official had specifically , named the National Guard as the major part of any " contingency plan . " The Commissioner , who has been working a 20-hour day during the emergency , took a few minutes yesterday morning in his office at Police Headquarters to voice his feelings on the crisis . " The city must be protected , " he said . " If we have to seek outside help , we 'll do it . If the men do not come back to work within the next two days , I shall not hesitate to act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the National Guard ? " he was asked . " Yes , that 's it , " he replied . Mr. Murphy pointed out that the strike would be in its sixth day today and said that " there are limits " to how much the skeleton force of officers and detectives now working could take . A spokesman for the National Guard in Albany said over the weekend that nearly 10,000 members of the 42d ( Rainbow ) Division who lived in or near the city could be mobilized overnight . Some units , he said , could be rounded up within four hours . Some officers of the National Guard have been in close touch with Commissioner Murphy for several days , but representatives of the Guard remained silent yesterday . " There will be no interviews or statements , " a spokesman said , " because the Governor wo n't allow it . " Privately , Guard sources said that high-ranking officers were fearful of getting " caught in a squeeze " between Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller . 1968 Strike Recalled Part of the reticence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the city sanitationmen in 1968 when Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller clashed over the use of troops . In that case , the Mayor requested guardsmen and was turned down by the Governor , who then went on to help work out a settlement . Ironically , about 500 New York City policemen are members of the Guard and presumably could be ordered to do as soldiers what they have refused to do as patrolmen . In the interview at Police Headquarters , Commissioner Murphy said he had confidence in his men . " As I approach the time to make that difficult decision , I do agonize , " he said . " I have faith in policemen and I know they are sharing that agony , " he continued . Mr. Murphy said he understood the " emotional blow " sustained by policemen last week when the Court of Appeals ruled that the patrolmen 's pay parity claim must go back to a lower court . The ruling delayed a decision on whether patrolmen were right in their demand for $2,700 in hack pay and a $1,200 annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioner said . " They have homes and they were counting on this money . I understand the emotional blow , but I regret their action . " Commissioner Murphy said his decision on recommending use of the National Guard would not be made until delegates of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association met this morning to decide whether to continue the " job action " or to call a full-fledged strike . " Because of the great faith I have in the men , " the Commissioner said , " I feel they 're coming back to work . " Although the streets of the city were almost bare of policemen , there were almost the normal number of people on duty at Police Headquarters , particularly in the communications section , where a number of young police trainees have been brought in to answer emergency calls . Lieut . Frank W. Kobelski , assistant administrator of the communications section , said there had been no delays in answering those who call 911 , the police emergency telephone number . " We 've had to tell them to screen out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost property , " he said . " We are just rolling on calls involving violence and crimes in progress . " Some units , such as missing persons , planning and operations , and the Criminal Identification Bureau , are still functioning , but at a reduced level . Many of the personnel  --  officers and detectives ? have been shifted to patrol duty .
