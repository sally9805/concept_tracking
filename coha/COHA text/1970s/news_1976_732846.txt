txt Kenya 's venerable President , Jomo Kenyatta , leads a country of 13 million East Africans , divided into more than 40 tribes , four of them numbering over a million persons apiece . The nation is equally diverse , ranging from the port town of Mombasa on the warm Indian Ocean coast to the capital of Nairobi , 300 miles inland , a mile high in altitude , and 80 miles south of the equator . Kenya continues westward to the shores of Lake Victoria and northward to Ethiopia , with vast tracts of semi-desert , bushland , game preserves , and fertile farmland between its urban centers . In the markets of the cities and towns there are not only black Africans busy sorting and vending Kenya 's produce but also many Asians . These are the descendants of men who came to Kenya in the early colonial days to build the railway to Uganda and stayed . on to become shopkeepers and entrepreneurs . Now Kenya citizens too , the Asians are still on hand , with their bazaars , mosques , and temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . In contrast to the rural areas , where living is still primitive by Western standards , Nairobi is a showcase of Kenyan modernity . This is symbolized not only by the new Kenyatta Conference Center , with its statue of the robed President gazing toward the nearby Parliament building , but also by well-dressed Kenyans busily shopping in downtown areas . Elsewhere , hand-pulled carts and automobiles jostle for space . Almost everywhere there are large numbers of children , for the birthrate is high . A considerable percentage of the population is under age 18 . In Nairobi , the children go to classes in morning and afternoon shifts , and everywhere their numbers tax the nation 's resources to provide schools and teachers . Such is Kenya , a land of many contrasts , which this month celebrates the 13th anniversary of its independence from Britain .
