Genetic engineering is just in its earliest tinkering stage , but it is already seen both as a great medical hope and a bugaboo . By learning the secrets of the genes , science is increasingly able to alert couples who run an unusually high risk of passing on crippling defects ; sometimes a warning is possible even before children are conceived . Tests can also discover disabilities in the unborn as well as in infants and young children before symptoms appear . <P> Example : if both parents carry the genes for Tay-Sachs disease or sickle-cell anemia , there is great danger that their children will actually get the disease . Many geneticists and physicians are therefore enthusiastic about widespread genetic screening . They also support a new Massachusetts law-not yet put into practice-that would make sickle-cell examinations a requirement for school admission . <P> Others , however , argue that science and society must go easy not only in interfering with the genetic process , but even in mass screening . A 24-member team of scientists , lawyers and ethicists has been examining this question with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hastings-on-Hudson , N.Y. , for the past year . Now , in the New England Journal of Medicine , the group endorses the principle of helping people to make " informed choices regarding reproduction . " But the authors are concerned that large-scale testing could violate people 's rights to privacy and freedom of choice . Specifically , they argue that : <P> &gt; There should be no attempt to impose a standard of genetic normality on any segment of the population . Virtually everyone carries a small number of harmful recessive genes . To eliminate these from the gene pool might require partners who both have similar " bad " traits to avoid parenthood entirely . <P> No program should be made compulsory . " There is currently no public health justification for mandatory screening for the prevention of genetic disease . The conditions being tested for in screening programs are neither ' contagious ' nor , for the most part , susceptible to treatment at present . " People , the report says in effect , have the right to bad genes . <P> - Care should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The information obtained should be made available only to the individuals involved and their physicians . Otherwise , people might be stigmatized socially , and even perhaps denied life and health insurance . <P> Most doctors agree that guidelines are necessary , but some find the Hastings rules too tight . They argue that once a high-risk group is spotted-such as Jews of Eastern European descent who are vulnerable to Tay-Sachs disease-all its members of child-bearing age should be tested . <P> They also believe that information gained by screening should be passed on - to blood relatives , for instance , who might then be persuaded to have examinations themselves . In an editorial accompanying the Hastings report , Boston 's Dr. John Littlefield suggests that the traditional , confidential patient-doctor relationship might be less important than people 's " right to know about the risks that they run , whether infectious , toxic or genetic .
